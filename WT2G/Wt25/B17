<H2>OS/2 Compatibility</H2>

<P>
Our beta testers have given us mixed reports about running <B>Free
Agent</B> under OS/2 3.0 (Warp). Some can't make it work at all,
while others are able to get it working more or less smoothly.
It's possible that at least some of the difficulties are caused
by <A HREF="csbugs.htm#OS2" >problems </A> in <B>Agent</B>, while
others may be setup problems in Warp. We intend to make <B>Agent</B>
work correctly under OS/2, so we are setting up an OS/2
installation ourselves to evaluate the compatibility issues. Since
it may be a while before we have conclusive information, we'll
summarize what our beta testers are reporting until we can supplement
it with our own findings.
<P>
Please understand that we are simply reporting information that
we can neither confirm nor test at the moment. These are unsubstantiated
reports from our users, supplemented by some Usenet browsing on
our part (no shortage of newsreaders here!).
<P>
A posting in the comp.os.os2.networking.tcp-ip newsgroup talked
about some general steps to make Winsock programs work with Warp's
Internet Access Kit (IAK):
<PRE>
If winsock programs don't work with the IAK check:
1. in autoexec.bat there is a line : 'SET ETC=C:\TCPIP\DOS\ETC'
2. in autoexec.bat PATH line C:\TCPIP\DOS\BIN is in front
3. there is no other WINSOCK.DLL in \WINDOWS or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM
4. in \TCPIP\DOS\ETC there is a file 'resolv'
5. in CONFIG.SYS there are lines saying:
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\inet.sys
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\ifndisnl.sys
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\vdostcp.vdd
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\vdostcp.sys
      RUN=c:\tcpip\bin\cntrl.exe
      RUN=c:\tcpip\bin\vdosctl.exe
</PRE>

<P>
One OS/2 user reported that he had trouble making <B>Free Agent
</B>run until he un-installed win32s, after which it worked fine.
We don't know why this might be the case, and we haven't heard
similar reports with Windows, but it might be worth trying.
<P>
Another user reported that <B>Free Agent</B> crashed right after
the startup graphics in Windows Enhanced mode, but worked fine
in Standard mode.
<P>
Several people have reported odd screen-related problems, usually
with <B>Free Agent</B> failing to completely obscure other windows
that should have been under it.  Most of them report that these
problems don't prevent <B>Free Agent</B> from working properly
otherwise.
<P>
One user reports success running <B>Free Agent</B> in a separate
seamless WinOS/2 session, and sent us a copy of his settings:

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Browsing and Reading</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><A NAME="RetrieveAll"><B>How do I mark and retrieve all articles
in certain groups?</B></A></P>
<P>There are two ways to do this:</P>
<P>If you want to do this on an ad-hoc basis after you've retrieved the
headers, press Ctrl+A to select all of the headers and then select <B>Online
| Get Marked Article Bodies</B>, or <B>Article | Mark for Retrieval.</B></P>
<P>If you <EM>always</EM> want to get the bodies automatically for a
particular group, select the group and use the <B>Group | Properties</B>
option to open the Group Properties dialog. On the Retrieving page,
check "Override default settings" and then check "Retrieve bodies for
all new articles."</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoMarkRead"><B>If  I retrieve new headers, but I don't
read any articles, how do I prevent the headers from being marked as
read?</B></A></P>
<P>By selecting <B>Group | Default Properties</B> (or <B>Properties</B>
if behavior is desired only in current group) and removing the X from
the "New Article Headers" box in the "Marking Articles Read" category.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="Ketchup"><B>What does the "Catch Up" option do?</B></A></P>
<P>Here's the question that one of our beta testers sent us:</P>
<PRE>> I was wondering if I could get an explanation of the function of the
> catching-up choice in the online menu.  If, after being away, you want
> to "catch-up" what is the difference in using this choice and the mark
> all articles as read choice?</PRE>
<P><B>Agent</B> remembers the number of the last article it has
retrieved from the news server.  When you "get new headers", <B>Agent</B>
gets all higher-numbered articles.  The <B>Online | Catch Up With
Selected Groups</B> command queries the server to find out the highest
number, but does not retrieve any headers, so that the next time you get
headers, you'll only get articles posted since you did the catch up.</P>
<P>The <B>Article | Mark All Articles Read</B> command simply marks as
read (changes them from red to black) all articles that you have already
retrieved.  It doesn't affect which articles <B>Agent</B> will retrieve
the next time you contact the server.</P>
<P>BTW, another way to "catch up" is to open the Default Group
Properties dialog and temporarily change the "Limit number of headers
per session" value.  That way, you can catch up by retrieving, say, no
more than 50 of the most recent articles per group.
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="AutoExpand"><B>How do the auto-thread-expand options
work?</B></A></P>
<P>There are two options on the <B>Navigation</B> tab of the <B>Options
| Preferences</B> dialog box that determine whether threads are
displayed in expanded or collapsed form:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Show threads initially Collapsed:</B>  If you check this
option, all threads will be shown collapsed when you first open a
newsgroup.  If you un-check it, they will all be shown expanded.</LI>
<LI><B>Automatically expand threads containing new articles:</B>  If
you check this option, threads will be expanded when you jump into them
with the "Skip to/View next unread" commands.  They're expanded <B>only</B>
if you've already retrieved and read the first article in the thread --
the idea here is to avoid expanding threads that you've never seen
before (and forcing you to step through them one article at a time). 
Only threads that you've previously shown an interest in are expanded.</LI></UL>
<P>This feature has been confusing a lot of our beta testers, and we're
looking at ways to make it simpler.  In addition, the option to
automatically expand threads when you jump into them doesn't seem to
work if you are in three-pane mode and have the focus in the body pane. 
Keep watching these pages.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="MarkJump">Why does it jump when I Mark or Ignore an
article?</A></B></P>
<P>This is caused by one of the new navigation features added in
version 0.46.  <B>Agent</B> automatically skips to the next unread
article when you mark an article for retrieval or ignore a thread.  If
you do not like this behavior, you can disable it by selecting <B>Options
| Preferences</B> and clicking on the <B>Navigation</B> tab.  Now click
on the <B>Marking or ignoring an article skips to the next unread
article</B> option to remove the check mark and press <B>OK</B> to
dismiss the dialog box.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoDate"><B>Why doesn't the date appear in the article
list?</B></A></P>
<P>Actually, the date does appear to the right of the article header. 
If you use the multi-paned view, it is probably off the right of your
screen.  Try using Zoom mode.  Choose the <B>Navigate | Zoom Window</B>
menu item, or click the maximize button in one of the individual panes.
 <B>Agent</B> is pretty smart about switching back and forth between
the panes automatically, and you can switch manually by clicking on the
tabs at the top of the window.
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoDateAuthor"><B>Why don't I see the Date or Author
fields in the browser?  [Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P> Starting with <B>Agent</B> version .99a, we've made the Message
List pane sortable by Date, Author, Subject and Size, and allowed you to
select this by clicking on the respective column headers.  For example,
to sort by Author you just click on the header for the Author column.</P>
<P>However, this required us to change the format somewhat, by adding
an Author column instead of simply appending the author's name to the
end of the message subject as we previously did.  Depending on how you
have your screen layout set, this may cause some of the columns to not
fit in your window any more.  To see them again, Zoom the pane to fill
your screen and readjust the column widths by using the mouse to drag
the header separators to the desired location.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SmallStatus"><B>Why can't I make the status column
smaller?</B></A></P>
<P>In addition to the line count, the status column has to display all
of the article status icons (Mark, Watch, Ignore, Keep, Thread, Body).  
We've limited the minimum size of the column so that there is room for
all of these.  We found that if we didn't do that, new users would make
the column so small that some of the information would disappear and
then they'd get confused because it was missing.  You can also use the
Zoom command, which can be handy to make the article browser fill the
entire window and give you maximum width for the subject column.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoHeader"><B>How do I suppress the header details when
I'm reading an article?</B></A></P>
<P>Remove the checkmark from the <B>Article | Show All Header Fields</B>
menu item (or use the right mouse button to bring up the speed menu and
remove the checkmark from the <B>Show All Header Fields</B> item). This
will start the article just after the header.</P>
<P>Note that this won't eliminate a header that somebody else quoted
and included in the article.  That makes it into part of the article
body, where it is always displayed.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="QuoteWrap"><B>Why does some word-wrapped quoted text
appear in the wrong color?</B></A></P>
<P>When you're viewing an article that contains quoted text, you may
sometimes notice that the text is word-wrapped and that the wrapped
lines appear in black instead of blue (or whatever color you've chosen
for quoted text).  This is actually a problem with the article itself,
not with <B>Agent</B>.</P>
<P>This happens when the newsreader that created the article decides to
word-wrap the quoted text and does not put a ">" at the beginning of the
wrapped lines.  Because they don't start with the quote character, <B>Agent</B>
has no way of knowing that they were originally part of the quote, and
so it displays them in black.  (To prevent you from perpetrating
erroneous quotations like this, <B>Agent</B> doesn't wrap quoted text. 
See the section on <A HREF="csfaqpst.htm#WordWrap">word-wrapping in the
editor</A> for more information about that.)</P>
<P>If <B>Agent</B> wraps part of a quoted line, it does not provide a
">" character but still displays it in blue.  It can do this because it
knows that the new line is really part of the quoted line above it.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="ReadWrap"><B>How does word-wrap work when I'm reading an
article?</B></A></P>
<P>The <B>Article | Word Wrap</B> menu item (or the <B>Word Wrap</B>
item on the speed menu that you get by clicking the right mouse button
while viewing an article) determines whether the article text is
displayed word-wrapped.  If word-wrap is on, all of the text will be
visible no matter how small your display window is, but it may be hard
to determine the article's original format.  If word-wrap is off, the
article will appear in its original format but you may have to use the
horizontal scroll bar to see all of it.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="LongTrunc"><B>Why do long articles appear to be
truncated?</B></A></P>
<P>If you download a very large article, the display may only show the
first part of it (the first 60,000 characters), followed by the message</P>
<PRE>[Sorry!
 This version of Agent cannot display articles longer than 60k bytes.
 We will remove this restriction in a later version.
 In the meantime, you can view the entire article by
 printing it or by saving it as a file.]</PRE>
<P>The entire article has actually been downloaded, and if you save or
print it, it will appear in its entirety.  The restriction affects only
the display, and will be fixed in a later release.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NotAvail"><B>Why do I get "This article is no longer
available" errors?</B></A></P>
<P>This means that your news server no longer has the article that you
just tried to download.  This can easily happen if you have your purging
settings defined to keep article headers for a fixed number of days or
to never purge them at all (see the <B>Purging</B> tab on the
<B>Group | Properties</B> dialog box).  Because news servers keep
articles for an unpredictable amount of time, the only safe settings are
<B>Purge All</B> and <B>Purge articles no longer available on server</B>.</P>
<P>In earlier versions of Free Agent, misleading information from the
server could also cause this problem even if you had the <B>Purge
articles no longer available on server</B> option set.  The following
topic describes the reason for this and the fix that we implemented in
Free Agent 1.0 / Agent .99.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SlowRetrieve"><B>Why do the latest versions retrieve
headers more slowly?</B></A></P>
<P>One of Agent's purging options is "When the article is no longer
available on the server".   In previous versions (prior to Free Agent
1.0 / Agent .99), it would do this by checking the range of available
articles reported by the server and purging all articles whose numbers
were before the available range.  For example, if the server reported
that articles 204-566 were available, Agent would purge all articles
with numbers 203 or less.</P>
<P>But our beta testing showed that in many circumstances there would
be gaps in the reported range of articles.   This would typically happen
when one article was posted in a way that would cause it to remain on
the server much longer than normal.  This could happen if an article was
posted with an explicit expiration date, or if an article was
cross-posted.   (In many cases, cross-posted articles are not deleted
from any groups until they are deleted from all groups.)</P>
<P>These gaps would cause Agent to think that articles were still
available when they really weren't.  This would cause two problems for
the user.  First, you might try to retrieve the body for one of these
articles and then have Agent report that the article was <A HREF="#NotAvail"
>no longer available</A>.  Second, Agent would fail to purge large
numbers of articles if there were really big gaps in the range.</P>
<P>In the latest release of Agent, we solved these problems by having
Agent request a complete list of articles from the server.  With this
list, Agent is able to purge all articles no longer available, even if
there are gaps in the numbering range.  Agent gets the list of articles
as part of the get-new-headers operation, after it has retrieved header
information about new articles.</P>
<P>Our tests showed that retrieving a complete list of articles adds
only a few seconds to the retrieval time for most groups.  However, we
have also found that some news servers are very slow to return the
complete article list.  If you've noticed that Agent pauses during
get-new-headers, then you probably have one of those servers.  You can
eliminate the delays by turning off the <B>Always get complete list of
server's available articles</B> option on the <B>Group Properties |
What to Purge</B> dialog.  This will make Agent work the way it used to.
 The downside to turning off the option is that the "no longer
available" purging option may fail to purge all unavailable articles,
leading to the problems discussed above.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SlowUpdate"><B>Why does it take so long to update a group
after retrieving headers?  [Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P>Agent now allows you to sort your newsgroups by Author, Date,
Subject and Size as well as by Thread.  However, it needs to have the
group in Thread order to insert new headers into it, so it can do things
like respect Ignored and Watched threads.  If you have the group sorted
by anything except Thread, Agent has to sort it into Thread order,
update it with the new headers, and then re-sort it back into your
original order.  On some systems this can take a considerable time,
especially with large newsgroups.</P>
<P>You can tell that this is happening if you have your newsgroup
sorted by something other than Thread, the actual header retrieval (with
the moving progress indicator) happens at the normal speed, and there is
then a very long pause while the status bar says "Updating
&lt;newsgroup&gt;".</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="TooMany"><B>What do I do about a "too many articles to
retrieve" error?  [Free Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P>This error message is displayed if the sum of the articles currently
in Free Agent's database for the group and the total number of new
articles that may be retrieved (i.e. the total number of articles in the
range of new articles available from the server) is greater than 32,000.
 Of course, the total number of articles you end up with after the
retrieval may be less than this.  For example, Free Agent may end up
purging some old articles, and there may be gaps in the range of
available articles.  But Free Agent has to prepare for the worst, which
entails allocating enough space to store all old and newly-retrieved
articles.  Here are the workarounds:</P>
<UL><LI>Tell Free Agent to retrieve a smaller number of articles.  
You can do this with the <B>Online | Sample...</B> menu option, or by
setting the <B>Limit number of headers retrieved per session</B>
parameter on the <B>Retrieving</B> tab on the <B>Group | Default
Properties for All Groups</B> dialog to a value like 15,000.  This works
well if this is the first time you have visited a group, and you are
thus trying to retrieve all available articles.  Once you're caught up,
the number of articles retrieved in future sessions will be much
smaller.  (And besides, you're probably not going to read 32,000
articles anyway!)</LI>
<LI>Do a manual purge before getting new articles.</LI></UL>
<P>(After the above was written, we made the software smarter so that
it displays the error only in the rare cases when there really <EM>will</EM>
be 32,000 articles after the download.  Because we did this between the
Free Agent 1.0 and Agent .99 releases, all Agent versions have the new,
improved logic but all Free Agent versions still have the old code.  The
fix will automatically be included in the next Free Agent release, but
for now Free Agent users may need the above workaround.)</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Posting</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><A NAME="Signature"><B>How do I have my signature added to the end
of my post?</B></A></P>
<P>The default signature is designated in the <B>Group | Default
Properties for All Groups</B> Dialog.  Select the "Posting" tab on this
dialog, and then select the signature you want as your default
signature. The signature is automatically attached to all documents that
you post or mail using Agent.</P>
<P>If you would like to set up different signatures for each group, you
may override the default by first selecting the group whose properties
you are overriding, and then select
<B>Group | Properties for Selected Groups</B>. Go to the "Posting" tab,
select "Override Default Settings", and then choose the signature to use
when posting from that group.</P>
<P>You can also override the default signature on an individual message
by pressing the "All Fields" button and changing the signature field.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="WhereSignature"><B>Why doesn't my signature appear in the
edit window?</B></A></P>
<P>Once you've set up your signature as described in <A HREF="#Signature">
the topic above</A>, you may be surprised when it still doesn't appear
in the edit window or in the messages in the Outbox.  Don't worry -
Agent appends the signature at the time that it sends the message,
although it never appends it to the part that you see.  If you want to
verify that Agent is going to append the correct signature to your post,
press the <B>All Fields</B> button.  The name of the signature that
Agent is going to use will appear in the <B>Signature</B> field.  If
you want to use something other than the default signature, you can
change it here.</P>
<P>As a future enhancement, we're considering changing Agent to add the
signature to the editable text in the message window.  This would allow
you to confirm that the signature really was there, and to edit it if
necessary.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="WordWrap"><B>How does word-wrap work when I'm editing an
article?</B></A></P>
<P>For outgoing messages, there are two parameters that control
wordwrap -- the <B>Message | Word Wrap</B> menu option, and the <B>Line
Length</B> option on the <B>Message Posting</B> tab of the <B>Preferences</B>
dialog box.</P>
<P>When a message is transmitted, only the <B>Line Length</B>
parameter is used.  All lines are wrapped at <B>Line Length</B>
characters (remember, posted messages are inherently "fixed-pitch"),
with one exception:  Lines that begin with one of the quote characters
are not wrapped, based on the assumption that the original text was
formatted correctly (or, at least the way the author wanted) to begin
with.</P>
<P>The display in the editing window itself is also affected by the <B>Word
Wrap</B> option.  Lines will still wrap at the <B>Line Length</B>
setting (unless they're quoted), but if <B>Word Wrap</B> is set then
all lines also wrap as necessary to make them fit in the window.  If you
don't set <B>Word Wrap</B>, then lines may be wider than the window and
you'll have to scroll horizontally to see parts of them.</P>
<P>If you want to see exactly what the message will look like when it's
posted, select a fixed-pitch font, make sure your window is wide enough
to display <B>Line Length</B> characters, and turn off <B>Word Wrap</B>.
 OTOH, if you have a very narrow window and just want to see the text
without worrying about the final format, turn <B>Word Wrap</B> on,
select the font of your choice, and type away.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="SlowEdit">Why is editing an article sometimes so slow?</A></B></P>
<P>Because of some inefficiencies in our word-wrapping algorithm, the
response can sometimes be very slow when typing characters into the
middle of a large article.  We will be addressing this in a later
release.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="PostFail">Do I have to re-type a failed post?</A></B></P>
<P>No.  Whenever you attempt to post a message, <B>Agent</B> saves it
in the out-box.  This means that if the post fails for any reason, the
message is still there and you can try to post it later.  To do this,
select the <B>Online | Post Articles and Emails</B> menu option.</P>
<P>To see the contents of the out-box, select <B>Window | Open Outbox
Window</B>.  All of the articles and email messages that you have
entered will be there, with icons to show whether their posting was
successful.  A yellow smiling face means that the article was posted
successfully, while a red frowning face means that the posting failed
and will be tried again the next time you select the <B>Post Articles
and Emails</B> menu option.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="0lines">Why are my posts listed as having 0 lines?</A></B></P>
<P> Agent doesn't set the Lines field (the field that tells how many
lines there are in the article) when posting an article, because we
thought all news servers added it automatically.  It turns out that some
don't, so any article posted through them will end up with a header
claiming that it has 0 lines.  The article text is still there and can
still be viewed, but many newsreaders will display it in the browser
with a line count of 0.</P>
<P>This problem will be fixed in a later release.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Miscellaneous (Part 2)</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><P><B><A NAME="ReceiveSMTP">How do I receive email via SMTP? 
[Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>In general, it is impractical for a program like Agent to receive
email using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), although that is the
protocol used to send mail.  A conventional SMTP server has no provision
for queueing email for later retrieval, so Agent would have to be online
24 hours a day to avoid missing messages.  For this reason almost all
service providers use the POP3 protocol for transferring email to their
users, and that is the default protocol that Agent uses.</P>
<P>However, a few service providers (most notably Demon in the U.K.)
have implemented an unconventional SMTP server that <EM>does</EM> queue
email, and that's how they provide incoming mail to their users.  If
your service provider has such a setup, you must go to the <B>System
Profile</B> tab of the <B>Options | Inbound Email</B> dialog box and
set the <B>Receive email with SMTP</B> option.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="MoveOut">How can I move items from the Outbox to a
Folder?  [Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>Agent 99a does not allow you to move items from the Outbox to a
folder.  This will be added in the next interim release that you receive
(along with some other features that round out the basic email
functionality).</P>
<P>In future versions, Agent will automatically route messages to a
default folder that you specify.    The Outbox will become just a
repository for items that are waiting to be sent - and once they are
successfully sent, they will be copied to a folder of your choice.  From
this default folder, you'll be able to move/copy to other folders if
desired (as well as print and sort!).</P>
<P>We are also considering some automatic routing schemes for your
outbound mail, similar to the inbound mail filtering that Agent already
does.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="ImportEmail">Can I import my existing email database
into Agent?  [Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>If you're currently using Eudora or Pegasus as your email package,
we have written converter programs that allow you to import your
existing database into Agent.  The programs are available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/eudora.zip"
>ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/eudora.zip</A> and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/pegasus.zip"
>ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/pegasus.zip</A>, respectively,
and each includes a readme.txt file that describes how to use it.</P>
<P>These programs work by reading your existing database and writing a
text file that you can import into Agent with the <B>File | Import
Messages</B> menu option.  They will preserve any existing trays,
folders, and mailboxes that you had set up, converting them to Agent
folders.</P>
<P>We will add converters for other email packages according to demand
(and resources).  You can import new messages at any time without
disturbing your existing folders and messages, so you don't need to wait
for a converter before switching to Agent.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="CantImport">Why can't I select the  "Import Messages"
menu item?  [Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>The <B>File | Import Messages</B> option is grayed if you have
never run the <B>Options | Inbound Email</B> dialog box to configure
the system for email.  This is because import won't work until you've
designated a default inbound email folder.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="ManFolders">How does the "Manage Folders" menu work?</A></B></P>
<P>When you select either the <B>Copy</B> or <B>Move to Folder</B>
menu option the "flyout" menu will list up to nine folders that you have
specified, followed by a menu option "All Folders...".   You should put
the folders that you copy or move messages to most frequently on the
flyout menu so that they are easily accessible.  </P>
<P>To configure the flyout menu, select <B>Options | Manage Folder
Menus</B>.   There are two listboxes shown on the <B>Manage Folder
Menus</B> dialog box.  The left-most one shows a list of all folders
that aren't already displayed on the menu.   The right-most one shows
the folders that do appear on the menu.   To add a folder to the menu,
select a folder from the <B>Folder</B> listbox and click on <B>Add</B>.
 The folder name will appear in the <B>Menu</B> listbox.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="VersionEnvy">Why are some people posting with more
recent versions than I have?</A></B></P>
<P>If you think you're running the most recent version of <B>Agent</B>
or <B>Free Agent</B>, you may sometimes be surprised to see a newsgroup
posting by somebody with a higher version number than you have.  What's
happening here - are these people somehow special?  Why do they have
something that you don't have?</P>
<P>There are several possible reasons for this.  You might have missed
a release announcement and still be using outdated software.  See our
<A HREF="csrelhst.htm">Release History</A> page to make sure you
haven't missed anything.</P>
<P>If you're using the latest public version, something else is
obviously happening.  The post may have come from someone who is
beta-testing a new version that we will be releasing in the near future,
or they may have a special version that fixes a specific bug they were
encountering.  If the posting came from Fort&eacute;
(somebody@forteinc.com) then they're probably just using an internal
development version that hasn't even made it to beta yet.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="WhereFeature">Where are the features that I thought
would be in the Agent .99a release?</A></B></P>
<P>Depending on the feature in question, there are two possible
answers:</P>
<DL><DT><B>It isn't email</B></DT>
<DD>This is the basic <EM>Email</EM> release, so many non-email
features like kill lists and crossposted-article handling aren't
included.  They're not scheduled until the final Agent 1.0 release this
fall, although some may appear in earlier releases (as message sorting
appeared in this release).<P></P></DD>
<DT><B>It isn't basic email</B></DT>
<DD>This is the <EM>basic</EM> Email release, intended to get user
feedback on our core email functionality.  As such, many features that
aren't strictly necessary have been deferred to later releases so that
we could get this one to you as soon as possible.</DD></DL>
<P>The following features will be included in upcoming releases:</P>
<P><B>First Email Upissue</B> (due out very soon)</P>
<UL><LI><B>Basic Outbox management</B> - manually move messages from
the Outbox to folders.</LI>
<LI><B>Binary decoding</B> - automatically decode binary attachments
in incoming email.</LI></UL>
<P><B>Advanced Email Upissue</B></P>
<UL><LI><B>Address book</B> - individuals and mailing lists.</LI>
<LI><B>MIME support</B> - handle international characters and
MIME-encoded attachments.</LI>
<LI><B>Expanded Outbox management</B> - automatically place outbound
email  in folders</LI></UL>
<P><B>Final Agent 1.0 Release</B></P>
<UL><LI><B>Kill and Watch lists</B> - ignore or read all messages
from specified authors or subjects.</LI>
<LI><B>Crossposted message management</B> - only have to read
crossposted messages once.</LI>
<LI><B>Filtering</B> - see only unread articles, articles with bodies,
etc.</LI>
<LI><B>Etc.</B> - all other features listed on the <A HREF="agent.htm#Features"
>Agent page</A> that haven't been included in previous releases.</LI></UL>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="DialupCancel">How do I cancel a connection attempt
that's obviously failing?</A></B></P>
<P>(From some of the bug reports we've seen, a better title for this
one might be "Why doesn't <B>Agent</B> have a Cancel button on the
"Connecting to Server" dialog box?")</P>
<P>The "Connecting to Server" dialog box appears during the period of
time when <B>Agent</B> has passed control to the underlying winsock
driver, during the first call to the driver after it is loaded.  Whether
or not this happens during the dial-in phase depends on the particular
winsock driver you are using.  If you are using the Trumpet winsock, the
dial-in occurs as a side-effect of the first winsock call, which won't
return to <B>Agent</B> until the call either succeeds or fails.</P>
<P>That's why there is no cancel button on the dialog box - <B>Agent</B>
isn't in control of the process at this point, and has no way to tell
the winsock driver to cancel the connection attempt.  With Trumpet
Winsock, as far as we know at present, the only way to cancel the call
is to go to TCPMAN and press ESC.  That will cancel the connection
attempt and return control to <B>Agent</B>.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Miscellaneous</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><P><B><A NAME="Binary">How do I decode and view binary files?</A></B></P>
<P>(This discussion is taken almost verbatim from the "How to Retrieve
a Binary Attachment" section of our online help.  Whenever you don't
know how to do something, the "How To" button on the Help toolbar is
always a good place to start.)</P>
<P>The latest release of <B>Agent</B> has a greatly improved process
for retrieving, decoding, and viewing binary files.  You can now get
multiple binaries in a single operation, and bypass most of the manual
steps that were necessary in our first release.  To retrieve (and
optionally view) a binary posting from a newsgroup, follow the steps
below:</P>
<OL><LI><P><B>Select the binary file(s) you want:</B>  Select at
least one article from each binary file you want to retrieve.  In most
cases, <B>Agent</B> will be able to find all of the other articles that
contain parts of the binary file.</P><P>If you select articles for more
than one binary file, <B>Agent</B> will retrieve all of the articles
for all of the files you selected.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>Retrieve or view the files:</B>  Choose either <B>File |
Save Binary Attachments</B> or <B>File | Launch Binary Attachments</B>.
 </P><P>If you are configured for online operation, <B>Agent</B> will
immediately begin downloading and decoding the binary attachments. If
you selected the Launch... option, it will automatically run the Windows
application associated with the attachment's file type.</P><P>If you
are configured for offline operation, <B>Agent</B> will mark all
articles containing the attachments for later downloading.  The next
time you select the <B>Online | Get Marked Article Bodies</B> menu
item,<B>Agent</B> will download and decode the attachments.</P></LI></OL>
<P>Regardless of whether you chose the Save... or Launch... option, <B>Agent</B>
will store the binary files in the directory entered in the
<B>Attachments</B> tab of the <B>Group | Default Properties...</B>
dialog box, unless you've overridden that with the <B>Group |
Properties...</B> dialog box for the specific group you're in.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ManDecode">If the automatic process doesn't work:</A></B></P>
<P>Occasionally, you may find multi-part attachments whose subject
lines don't match the standard conventions (they might not include the
standard "Part 1 of 2" or "[1/2]" notation, for example).  In this case,
<B>Agent</B> won't be able to find all of the articles for the file or
won't be able to get them in the correct order.  This may announce
itself with a dialog box saying that <B>Agent</B> couldn't find all of
the articles, or with an error during the decoding process.</P>
<P>To decode such files, you'll need to select and order the articles
manually:</P>
<OL><LI>Select <EM>all</EM> of the articles that contain parts of the
binary file.  You can do this by selecting one article and then
Ctrl-clicking on the others to include them.  Be sure to select articles
for only one binary file; you'll have to repeat this entire process for
any others that you want.</LI>
<LI>Select the <B>File | Manually Save Binary Attachment</B> meu item.</LI>
<LI><B>Agent</B> will display a dialog box showing the articles you
selected.  Make sure they are all in order - if they aren't, use the Up
and Down buttons to order them correctly.</LI>
<LI>Launch or save the attachment by pressing the corresponding button.
 If you are offline and have not yet retrieved the articles, <B>Agent</B>
will immediately go online and download them.</LI></OL>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="BinEmail"><B>How do I decode binary attachments in
incoming email?  [Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P>The current release (.99b) doesn't include support for decoding
binary attachments in email - that is one of the features that will be
added in the next interim release.  Until that release appears, you can
decode binary attachments by using the <B>File | Save Messages As...</B>
menu option to save the message to a text file and then using an
external decoding program like Wincode to extract the attachment.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="WhenPurge">When do articles get purged?</A></B></P>
<P>Like most things in <B>Agent</B>, this is configurable.  By
default, <B>Agent</B> purges outdated articles from a group each time
you tell it to download new headers for the group, which you do with the
various <B>Get ... Headers</B> commands in the <B>Online</B> menu.</P>
<P>You can also choose to have articles purged whenever you close <B>Agent</B>,
so that old articles will be gone the next time you start up.</P>
<P>This means that when you're through browsing a group, your articles
aren't purged when you leave the group as they are with most other
newsreaders.  Instead they persist at least until you close <B>Agent</B>,
and perhaps until the next time you go online to get new headers, which
might be several days later.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="WhichPurge">How do I control which articles are
purged?</A></B></P>
<P>Whenever <B>Agent</B> is purging articles for a group, it examines
each article to see if it should be deleted.  It makes this decision
based on the settings in the <B>What to Purge</B> page of the <B>Properties...</B>
and <B>Default Properties...</B> dialog boxes (reached through the <B>Group</B>
menu).</P>
<P>These dialog boxes allows you to set different criteria for deleting
articles depending on whether you've previously downloaded the article
body and whether you've read the article.  For example, most people set
these options so that articles with their full text are kept longer than
mere headers, since these are the articles that interested them enough
to read in the first place.</P>
<P>There are two main sections on this dialog box - one for articles
that you've already read, and one for articles that are still marked
unread.  Within each section, there are separate options for articles
without bodies (i.e. headers only) and articles  that do have bodies
(i.e. whose text you've previously downloaded).</P>
<P>You can choose to have articles with no bodies deleted:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT><B>When they're no longer available on the
server</B></DT>
<DD>This option automatically deletes all headers that the news server
has already deleted  from its own list of articles.  Selecting this
option makes the list of articles displayed by <B>Agent</B> a mirror
image of the articles that are available from the server.  This is
probably the best option for  most groups.</DD>
<DT><B>When they're older than a specified threshold</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes headers based on their age.</DD>
<DT><B>On every purge</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes the headers on every purge.  Selecting this
will make <B>Agent</B> work like most other newsreaders, although we
think that negates one of our big advantages.</DD>
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For articles that do have bodies, you have the following options:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL>
<DT><B>On every purge</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes the articles before downloading any new
headers.  As with headers, selecting this will make <B>Agent</B> work
like most other newsreaders.</DD>
<DT><B>On every purge, delete bodies only</B></DT>
<DD>This is like the previous option, but leaves the header in the
database so that you can download the article again if you choose.</DD>
<DT><B>When they're older than a specified threshold</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes articles based on their age.  You might specify
that you want articles with bodies kept for 30 days, and manually set
the "Keep" flag for any that you don't want automatically purged.</DD>
<DT><B>Never</B></DT>
<DD>If you select this option, <B>Agent</B> will never automatically
delete articles.  They'll accumulate until you delete them manually, or
until something causes their purging status to change.  (For example,
you might set unread articles to never be deleted, but read articles to
be deleted after 30 days.  This means that an unread article would never
be purged, but when you read it it will then be purged after 30 days.)</DD></DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regardless of how you set the above options, you can always override
them for an individual article.  If you want to delete an article before
its time, simply delete it manually.  If you want to keep an article
longer, set its "Keep" flag and <B>Agent</B> will never automatically
delete it.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="OrdinaryPurge">How do I make purging work like other
newsreaders?</A></B></P>
<P><B>Agent</B> maintains an intelligent database of headers and
articles that persists from session to session.  This provides many
advantages over traditional newsreaders, like letting you see new
messages in context with older ones.  We strongly suggest that you try
using this for a while before deciding  to disable it; most of the
people here who use <B>Agent</B> wonder how we ever lived without it.</P>
<P>However, this feature does come at a cost in both downloading speed
and disk space usage, and it just isn't the way some people want to
work.  Here's how to make <B>Agent</B> behave very much like ordinary
newsreaders:</P>
<OL><LI>First, decide whether you want to revert to "ordinary"
behavior in all newsgroups or just some.<UL>
<LI>If you want to change all newsgroups, select the <B>Group |
Default Properties...</B> menu option.</LI>
<LI>If you want to change only certain groups, select them all in the
Groups pane and then select the <B>Group | Properties...</B> menu
option</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>Whichever version of Step 1 you perform, you will now have a
version of the Group Properties dialog box displayed.  Select the <B>What
to Purge</B> tab to bring up the first set of options.</LI>
<LI>If you're doing this for a subset of the groups, there will be an
<B>Override default settings</B> field at the top of the dialog box.
Click on this field until an X appears in the box.</LI>
<LI>There are four main fields in the dialog box:  <B>Read Articles
Without Bodies</B>, <B>Read Articles With Bodies</B>, <B>Unread
Articles Without Bodies</B>, and <B>Unread Articles With Bodies</B>. 
Select the <B>On every purge</B> option in <EM>all</EM> fields.</LI>
<LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button at the bottom of the dialog box.</LI></OL>
<P><B>Agent</B> will now behave much more like an ordinary newsreader.
 Whenever you download new headers for a group, it will delete all of
the existing headers and articles in that group (except those that
you've explicitly set to Keep), so that you see only the new ones. 
These new articles will remain in the database until the next time you
download more headers.</P>
<P>For an even closer simulation of a conventional newsreader, follow
the steps above and then continue on:</P>
<OL><LI>Select the <B>When to Purge</B> tab on the <B>Preferences</B>
dialog box</LI>
<LI>Go to the <B>When to Purge</B> section, remove the check from the
<B>When Retrieving new headers</B> option, and check the <B>When
Closing Agent</B> option instead.</LI>
<LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button at the bottom of the dialog box.</LI></OL>
<P><B>Agent</B> will now behave as much like an ordinary newsreader as
it can.  It will now delete all headers and messages in all newsgroups
whenever you close it, so the newsgroups will always be empty each time
you start the program (again, except for articles you've chosen to
Keep).</P>
<HR> 
<P><B><A NAME="ErrServer">Server Errors: 400 - 599</A></B></P>
<P>These are errors that the news server reports to <B>Agent</B> after
the connection has been completed.</P>

<DT><B>441 400 loadav [innwatch.load] 305 gt 300</B></DT>
<DT><B>441 Can't send connect request to server, No such File or
Directory
</B></DT>
<DD>These errors all mean that the news server has an internal problem
unrelated to anything you are doing.  Contact your service provider to
have it fixed.  When this happens, <B>Agent</B> saves the article you
were trying to post in its Outbox  (File | Open Outbox Window), so that
you can try to send it again later, after your news server is working
properly.</DD>
<DT><B>441 Can't generate Message-ID Error 0
</B></DT>
<DD>The error is generated internally by the server either if the
server is unable to obtain the current date and time (from itself), or
if it is unable to find out its OWN host name.  All of this happens
after <B>Agent</B> has posted the article to the server.  We recommend
that you contact your service provider and tell them about the error,
since it indicates a problem with their server.</DD>
<DT><B>441 Posted in the Future</B></DT>
<DD>This error means the date/time on the article, as sent by <B>Agent</B>,
is more than 24 hours later than the current date/time on the news
server.   You should double-check your PC's date and time, and the
timezone setting in <B>Agent</B> (on the <B>System Profile</B> page of
the <B>Preferences</B> dialog box).</DD>
<DT><B>441 437 Unwanted news group</B></DT>
<DD>The error means that the newsgroup is not carried by the news
server.  Perhaps this is a group that used to be carried and was
dropped.</DD>
<DT><B>480 Authentication required for command error trying to post</B></DT>
<DD>This error means that your news server requires you to provide
authentication before you can post.  You need to check with your service
provider to find out exactly what is required.  In most cases, you need
to supply the server a user name and password.  Once you get this
information from your provider, you can enter it on the <B>User Profile</B>
page of the <B>Preferences</B> dialog box.</DD>
<DT><B>500 Command not Recognized
</B></DT>
<DD>Your news server is not configured to handle a command issued by
<B>Agent</B> (usually the XOVER or the XHDR commands for retrieving
information about articles).   <B>Agent</B> requires that the server
accept one of these commands.   You will need to contact your service
provider and see if they can provide a server that honors these
commands.
</DD>
<DT><B>500 Error trying to connect to server
</B></DT>
<DD>This error  means that <B>Agent</B> is attempting to log you into
your news server, but your server doesn't actually require a login.  Go
to the <B>User Profile</B> page of the <B>Preferences </B>dialog box
and uncheck the <B>Server requires authorization login</B> option.</DD>
<DT><B>502 Authentication Error</B></DT>
<DD>Check to see if your news server really requires authentication. 
If it doesn't or if you are not sure, open the <B>Preferences</B>
dialog box, go to the <B>User Profile</B> page, and uncheck  the <B>Server
requires authorization login</B> option.  If you know that your server
<EM>does</EM> require authentication, double-check your <B>User Name</B>
and <B>Password</B> on this dialog box.</DD>
<DT><B>502 You are not in my access file</B></DT>
<DT><B>502 You only have permission to transfer</B></DT>
<DT><B>502 You have no permission to talk</B></DT>
<DD>These all indicate that you are not properly set up as an
authorized user of the news server.  You will have to contact your
service provider or news administrator to get this corrected.</DD>
<DT><B>550 Addressee unknown</B></DT>
<DD>Usually, this means you tried to send an email to someone whose
email address was unknown to the email server, and the server refused to
try to forward the mail to another server.
</DD></DL>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="ErrWinsock">Winsock Errors: 10000 - 11999</A></B></P>
<P>These are errors that your Winsock driver reports to <B>Agent</B>,
and usually indicate problems with the connection process.</P>
<DL><DT><B>10036 WSAEINPROGRESS</B></DT>
<DD>This occurs primarily with Spry (Internet in a box, CompuServe CID)
dialers. If you're using <B>Free Agent</B> version 0.55 or earlier,
upgrade to the latest version as described in the

drivers.</DD>
<DT><B>10050, <A NAME="Error20050">20050</A> WSAENETDOWN</B></DT>
<DD>We have some new information from Novell regarding the errors 10050
and 20050 (WSAENETDOWN).   This was an error in their first version of
winsock.dll and it is fixed in the most recent version available in
LWP42T.EXE on ftp.novell.com.  Also, not having the file NOVASYNC.EXE in
\net\bin or in your path will cause this error.  This file provides the
asynchronous support for Novell's winsock.dll.</DD>
<DT><B>10055 WSAENOBUFS</B></DT>
<DD>There is not enough memory available for WINSOCK.DLL to create any
buffers for <B>Agent</B>.  The problem is with low memory (memory below
640k), not overall memory.  Free up more conventional memory.</DD>
<DT><B>10060 WSAETIMEOUT
</B></DT>
<DD>This may be a case where <B>Agent</B> loads the winsock.dll, but
the winsock driver fails to load. Try loading the driver prior to
<B>Agent</B>. If this works, then make sure the winsock driver is in
the DOS path. You may also need to free more conventional memory.</DD>
<DT><B>10061 Connection refused by server</B></DT>
<DD>This error means that the server is either too busy to accept more
connections, or possibly has been taken down for maintenance.</DD>
<DT><B>11002 Host name not found</B></DT>
<DD>This errror indicates that the name lookup failed, but that it
might succeed if you try again.  If you set the following AGENT.INI
option, Agent will do just that, until it times out.<BR><TT>	[Online]<BR>
  	RetryGetHostName=1</TT><BR>If that doesn't work, replace the news
server's domain name with its IP address, in the <B>System Profile</B>
page of the <B>Options | Preferences</B> dialog box, so as to skip the
name lookup.</DD>
<DT><B>11004 Host Name not Found</B></DT>
<DD>This error means that the Winsock driver was unable to find the
host name for your news (NNTP) or mail (SMTP) server.  Double-check the
name of these servers in the <B>System Profile</B> page of the <B>Options
| Preferences</B> dialog box.   Usually, they will be something like
"news.company.com" and "mail.company.com", where "company.com" is your
provider's domain name.  As a workaround, try entering the numeric (IP)
address for the servers.<BR>This error can also occur if you run out of
low memory.  Try closing another application or try loading your dialer
and connecting to your news server before running <B>Agent</B>.</DD>
<DT><B>11004 No Data of Requested type</B></DT>
<DD>An error occurred during initialization of the Winsock driver.
Check your Winsock driver setup.</DD>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: CompuServe</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><B><A NAME="Servers">What names do I use for the news and mail
servers?</A></B></P>
<P>The simple answer is to use <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> for the
news server and <TT>mail.compuserve.com</TT> for the mail server. 
However, <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> may cause some trouble for you,
especially if you use <B>Agent</B> in offline mode.  See the following
topic for a discussion of the problem and its solution.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="PhysicalServers">Why do I get "This article is no
longer available" errors?</A></B></P>
<P>In addition to the <A HREF="csfaqrd.htm#NotAvail">normal reasons</A>
for getting this error, there is another problem that only affects
CompuServe users.  As it turns out, <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> is
sort of a virtual address, and when you connect to it you get randomly
connected to one of six physical servers they have installed to handle
the load.  These servers are mostly synchronized with each other, but it
seems to take several hours for articles to reach all six of them.</P>
<P>This means that if you get headers from one server, go offline and
mark them, and then connect to a different server to download them, you
may get "Article not available on server" errors for some of the most
recent articles.</P>
<P>The solution is to always connect to the same server, so that you're
always presented with a consistent set of articles.  You can do this by
using one of the physical server names listed below, thus bypassing the
random-connection mechanism.</P>
<P>Note that this problem primarily affects <B>Agent</B> in offline
mode.  Now that CompuServe has the servers synchronized to within
several hours of each other (and using the same article numbers), you
may be able to use <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> reliably in online
mode.  That address is a problem only when you go offline between
downloading headers and bodies, and your online browsing style may
prevent that from ever happening.  If so, you may gain reliability and
performance by using <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT>, since the switching
mechanism should connect you to the best available server.</P>
<P>If you decide that you do want to use one of the physical servers,
open the <B>Preferences</B> dialog box, go to the
<B>System Profile</B> page, and set the <B>News Server</B> field to
one of the names below:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>dub-news-svc-1.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-2.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-3.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-4.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-5.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-6.compuserve.com
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once you've done this, disconnect from the server, select all of the
newsgroups you follow, and do an <B>Online | Get All Headers in
Selected Groups</B> operation.  This will download <EM>all</EM> of the
headers for your groups, without regard for their article numbers, and
will delete any that are duplicates of ones you've already downloaded. 
It will also reset the article-number counters so that you'll be able to
properly retrieve new articles in the future.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="NoGroup">Why are some newsgroups missing?</A></B></P>
<P>If you've been using a CIS newsreader like WinCIM to do your Usenet
reading, you may discover that you can't access some of your regular
newsgroups through <B>Agent</B>.  If this happens, the first thing to
do is to make sure you have the very latest newsgroup list from the
server.  To do this, select the <B>Online | Get New Groups</B> menu
option. </P>
<P>If it still doesn't appear, that means the CompuServe server doesn't
carry that newsgroup.  The CIS readers use a different server than the
NNTP servers that <B>Agent</B> (and all other Winsock newsreaders) do,
and the two sets of servers don't seem to carry the same newsgroups. 
You'll have to ask CompuServe to start carrying your newsgroup on their
NNTP servers.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="TypeGroup">Can I just type the name of a missing
newsgroup?</A></B></P>
<P>The CIS newsreaders allowed you to type in the name of a newsgroup
if it didn't appear in the group list.  This is because they don't
display the names of all available groups, so that is the only mechanism
to access some of them.</P>
<P>Because <B>Agent</B> always displays all the newsgroups available
on the server (if its copy of the list is up to date; do an <B>Options
| Get New Groups</B> if it isn't), there is no facility for manually
entering a group name.  If it doesn't appear in the list, then the
server doesn't carry it.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="RecEmail">Can I receive email with Agent?  [Agent
only]</A></B></P>
<P>At the moment, you can't use <B>Agent</B> to receive email through
CompuServe.  The problem is that CompuServe doesn't provide a POP3
server, but automatically routes all incoming email to your CIS account.
 We have heard reports that they will offer such service in the future,
in which case <B>Agent</B> should be compatible with it.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="Forums">Which forums carry discussions about Agent?</A></B></P>
<P>Our official support area is Section 20 of the Windows Connectivity
(<TT>GO WINCON</TT>) forum.  We monitor this regularly, replying to
user questions, and upload the most recent versions of <B>Agent</B> and
the downloadable FAQs in the library there.</P>
<P>We also monitor the Internet Resources (<TT>GO INETRE</TT>) and
Internet New User (<TT>GO INETNEW</TT>) forums, and respond to user
questions there as well.  (We no longer provide suport in the
NetLauncher Support forum (<TT>GO NLSUPPORT</TT>), as we've been
advised that it's inappropriate there.)  If you want to post a question
in one of these forums, it's best to include the word <B>Agent</B> in
the Subject line so that we'll be sure to see it.</P>

<LI>Sun PCNFS, Quarterdeck Winsock  (These two are due to a bug that
we'll be fixing shortly.)</LI></UL> 
<HR> 
<P><B><A NAME="Chameleon">Chameleon</A></B>
</P>
<P>We've tested version 3.11N, which is the &quot;lite&quot; version
that's been bound into popular Internet books. It works with
<B>Agent</B>, but it doesn't have a &quot;dial-on-demand&quot; mode to
fully support our offline operation. You'll have to manually connect and
disconnect from your service provider.</P>
<HR> 
<P><B><A NAME="IIABox">Internet In A Box / CompuServe NetLauncher</A></B>
</P>
<P>We are <B>not</B> compatible with version 1.0, which does not
support the async <TT>GetHostByName
</TT> function.  We <B>are</B> compatible with versions 1.0a and above.
 For information about upgrading to version 1.0a, see <A HREF="http://support.spry.com/"
>Spry's Web pages
</A>.
</P>
<P>Note that there appear to be <I>two</I> updates, one to the DLL and
one to the dialer.  Versions 0.55 and earlier of <B>Free Agent</B>
require the new DLL but the old dialer.  All later versions of <B>Free
Agent</B> (and all versions of <B>Agent</B>) work with the latest DLL
and dialer.</P>
<P>The CID program that is included in CompuServe's NetLauncher package
is basically the latest version of Spry's winsock driver.  If you're
using it, you should therefore make sure you have <A HREF="dlmain.htm">upgraded</A>
past version 0.55 of <B>Free Agent</B> as described above.</P> 
<HR> 
<P><B><A NAME="Windows">Microsoft WFWG, Windows 95, and Windows NT
</A></B>
</P>
<P>We've tested <B>Agent</B> with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows
95, and Windows NT 3.5, using their standard protocol stacks, and found
no problems.</P>
<P>If you're using one of the 32-bit versions, you'll need to install
the winsock.dll that is supplied with it before you can use <B>Agent</B>
(or any other 16-bit Winsock application).  Our experience has been t
hat Windows 95 installs it automatically when you install the TCP/IP
networking protocol, but we've had at least one user report that they
had to install it manually.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NetCruiser"><B>Netcom NetCruiser</B></A></P>
<P><B>Agent</B> is compatible with version 1.6 of Netcom's NetCruiser
software, but <EM>not</EM> with earlier versions.  Here are the steps
to configure NetCruiser to work with <B>Agent</B>:</P>
<OL><LI>Under the <B>Settings|Startup Options</B> menu option in
NetCruiser, make sure you have checked <B>load Winsock on startup</B>
(the next time you call using NetCruiser it will automatically load the
Winsock driver).<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>  You MUST be connected at
the time in order to receive the <B>Settings|Startup Options</B> menu
option!</P></LI>
<LI>Add your NetCruiser directory (e.g. <TT>C:\NETCOM</TT>) to the
PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.<P></P></LI>
<LI>After all of the above, exit Windows and reboot your computer so
the changes can take effect.<P></P></LI>
<LI>Connect to NETCOM using NetCruiser, minimize it, and then launch
<B>Agent</B>.<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>  After connecting with NETCOM,
you must close the news blurb that appears each time you log on before
the Winsock driver will load!  All you should see is the large NETCOM
Logo on the screen.</P></LI></OL>
<P>Once that's done, you'll need to configure <B>Agent</B> to work
with the NETCOM servers.  Go to the <B>System Profile</B> tab of the
<B>Options | Preferences</B> dialog box and enter the following server
names:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>News Server:  nntp.ix.netcom.com<BR>Mail Server: 
smtp.ix.netcom.com</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="Novell">Novell Netware Winsock</A></B></P>
<P>We are compatible with the latest version of Netware Winsock,
although earlier versions had a bug that prevented them from working. 
The latest version is available from Novell's ftp site as <TT>LWP42T.EXE</TT>.</P>
<P>Make sure you have the file <TT>NOVASYNC.EXE</TT> in <TT>\net\bin</TT>
or in your path.  This file provides the asynchronous support for
Novell's driver, and you will get  10050 or 20050 (<TT>WSAENETDOWN</TT>)
errors if it isn't found.</P>
<HR> 
<P><B><A NAME="TrumpetWinsock">Trumpet Winsock</A></B>
</P>
<P>We've tested versions 1.0B and 2.0B, and although both of them work
we recommend 2.0B. Version 1.0B of the driver contains a bug that can
cause <B>Agent</B> to stop responding while it's downloading an
article. This isn't a serious problem, because things return to normal
after the article is loaded, but you won't have the problem at all if
you use 2.0B. Version 1.0B also doesn't support PPP, so you'll need 2.0B
if you have such an account.
</P>
<P>(We've heard reports of bugs in version 2.1B that can cause <EM>serious</EM>
performance problems.  We're told that the Trumpet people are aware of
these, and that a workaround is to go to the <B>Setup</B> dialog box
and disable the <B>Van Jacobsen CSLIP compression</B> option.  We
haven't tested this ourselves, though, so we can't guarantee the
results.)  For other troubleshooting tips, see the <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~llarrow/trouble.html"
>Trumpet Winsock Troubleshooting Reference</A>.</P>
<P>There are no special setup requirements to make Trumpet work with
<B>Agent</B>, unless you have a dial-in connection and want to use
<B>Agent</B> as an Offline newsreader. To operate effectively in that
case, you must configure Trumpet Winsock to dial in and hang up on
demand. To do that, run TCPMAN.EXE, open the <B>Dialler</B> menu, and
select the <B>Options</B> item. On the ensuing dialog box, select the
<B>Automatic login and logout on demand</B> radio button. This makes it
run the login.cmd file whenever it needs to go online (typically when
it's loaded), and the bye.cmd file when it is unloaded.</P>
<P>While you're in this dialog box, you should also set the <B>SLIP
inactivity timeout</B> field to 0. This will prevent Trumpet Winsock
from hanging up if <B>Agent</B> is inactive for an extended period, as
can happen when purging and threading.  When you've made all these
changes, press <B>OK</B> to dismiss the dialog box.</P>
<P>The next thing to do is to tell Trumpet Winsock how to recognize
when it is on line. To do this, select the <B>File | Setup</B>menu item
and look at the <B>Online Status Detection</B> section of the dialog
box. This tells Trumpet Winsock how to recognize when it is on-line to
the Internet. If you're using a normal modem, you should check the <B>DCD
(RLSD) check</B> option. This tells Winsock to use the modem's carrier
detect line to detect its online status. Trumpet Winsock will probably
fail to dial your service provider if you check any of the other
options, because it will think it's already online. Press <B>OK</B>
when you have this option set correctly.
</P>
<P>Once you've done all that, you can test your setup by manually
running TCPMAN. It should start executing the login.cmd script as soon
as it starts up. If it doesn't, and you don't see any error messages,
chances are that it thinks it's already online. If this happens, go to
the <B>File | Setup</B> dialog box again and verify that you set the
right <B>Online Status Detection</B>option.
</P>
<P>If you have, the problem could be that your modem is reporting that
it's online even when it isn't. Many modems have the ability to force
their DCD (carrier detect) line to be on whenever the modem is powered
on and ready. For Trumpet Winsock to work properly, the modem must
instead be reporting the true state of DCD, so that Winsock can tell
when it's actually connected.</P>
<P>You'll probably have to break out your modem manual to figure out
how to proceed from here. Some older modems control this with a
dipswitch setting, but most modern ones use AT commands to set it. For
many modems, the command <TT>&amp;C1</TT> will cause the DCD line to
correctly report the modem's state. To test this, use a terminal program
to talk to your modem and issue whatever command your modem requires.
Then close the terminal program and start TCPMAN. If it now starts
executing the login script, you've got things wired -- almost.
</P>
<P>The one remaining chore is to save this modem configuration change,
so that it works this way every time you turn it on. To do that, get out
the modem manual again and find the command that saves the current
configuation as the default power-on setup. For many modems, the
appropriate command is <TT>&amp;W</TT> or <TT>&amp;W0
</TT>. Make sure your modem configuration is really the way you want it,
and then use your terminal program to issue the command to save the
configuration.
</P>
<P>(You might be thinking that you could save yourself the trouble of
doing this last step by simply including the <TT>&amp;C1</TT>command in
the setup string in your login.cmd file, so that it got executed every
time Trumpet Winsock tried to go online. There's a chicken-and-the-egg
problem here: Winsock won't even execute the file unless it knows it's
offline, but the modem will be telling Winsock that it's already online
until it gets the command. The modem must be correctly set up before
Winsock is loaded.)</P>

<BODY>
<P><A NAME="GIFConfig"><B>How do I configure a GIF viewer to work
with Agent?</B></A></P>
<P>First, you have to have a GIF viewing program, such as LVIEW.  What
you'll do is configure Windows so that when you press the View button on
the View Attachment dialog box, Agent will automatically launch your
viewer and pass the GIF file to it.</P>
<H5>To configure Windows to launch your viewer,</H5>
<UL>
<LI> Run File Manager</LI>
<LI> Select option <B>File | Associate...</B>  The Associate dialog
will appear.  In the dialog...</LI>
<LI> For "File with Extension", enter "GIF".</LI>
<LI> For "Associate With", enter the full path of your GIF viewer, for
example "c:\bin\lview31.exe"</LI>
<LI> Press OK</LI>
</UL>
<P>This works with other types of binaries.  Simply substitute the
correct file extension in place of GIF.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="Win95Assoc"><B>How do I make Agent automatically launch
binaries in Windows 95?</B></A></P>
<P>In order for <B>Agent</B> to launch binaries with their associated
applications in Windows 95, you must set up an "open" action for the
file type.  The steps below describe in detail how to do so:</P>
<OL><LI>Run the Win95 Explorer.</LI>
<LI>Choose the <B>View | Options...</B> menu item.</LI>
<LI>Choose the <B>File Types</B> tab in the resulting <B>Options</B>
dialog.</LI>
<LI>Examine the <B>Registered file types</B> list to see if the file
type is already listed:<UL>
<LI>If it is, select it and press the <B>Edit...</B> button to open
the <B>Edit File Type</B> dialog.  Then skip to step 5.</LI>
<LI> If not, press the <B>New Type...</B> button to open the <B>Add
New File Type</B> dialog.  Then add the new association:<OL>
<LI>Enter a description of the file type in the <B>Description of type</B>
field.  This is how the files will be identified in Explorer.  For
example, you might enter "JPEG image" for .JPG files.</LI>
<LI>Enter the file type's extension (<KBD>.JPG</KBD>, for example) in
the <B>Associated extension</B> field.</LI></OL></LI></UL></LI>
<LI>Press the <B>New...</B> button below the <B>Actions</B> window.</LI>
<LI>Type the word "<KBD>open</KBD>" (without the quotes) in the <B>Action</B>
field of the resulting <B>New Action</B> dialog.</LI>
<LI> Enter the path and filename for the associated application in the
<B>Application used to perform action</B> field.  You can use the <B>Browse...</B>
button to locate the program.</LI>
<LI>Press <B>OK</B> to close the <B>New Action</B> dialog.</LI>
<LI>(Optional:  You can press the <B>Change Icon...</B> button to
select the icon Windows 95 will use to represent the file type.  This
doesn't affect <B>Agent</B>, but may make manual operations with this
file type easier.)</LI>
<LI>Press Close to dismiss the <B>Add New (or Edit) File Type</B>
dialog.</LI>
<LI>Repeat the steps above for any other file types necessary.</LI>
<LI>Press <B>Close</B> to dismiss the <B>Options</B> dialog.</LI></OL>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="OS"><B>Which operating systems does Agent work with?</B></A></P>
<P>We've tested <B>Agent</B> with Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups
3.11, Windows 95, and Windows NT 3.5, and it works fine with all of
them.</P>
<P>We haven't tested <B>Agent</B> under OS/2, although we hope to do
so soon.  Our users are reporting <EM>very</EM> mixed results, but it
is working fine for some of them.  See our <A HREF="csos2.htm">OS/2
page</A> for more details.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="Offline"><B>How do I configure Agent for offline
operation?</B></A></P>
<P><B>Agent</B> is designed to make offline newsreading as convenient
as possible.  When used with an appropriate Winsock driver, it will
automatically connect to your service provider when it needs to go
online and disconnect as soon as it is through.  This can save you both
effort and money, but you may need to do some careful configuring to
make it work properly.</P>
<P>The first step is to configure <B>Agent</B> to go online only when
it needs to, and to immediately go offline when it is through.  To do
this, select the <B>Options | Preferences</B> menu item and click on
the <B>Online Operation</B> tab on the resulting dialog box.  This
dialog box contains several options that let you control the details of
<B>Agent</B>'s online and offline modes.  Although you may eventually
want to customize these to suit your own preferences, you can quickly
set them for offline operation by clicking the <B>Configure for Offline
Operation</B> button.
</P>
<P>Now that you've done that, <B>Agent</B> will attempt to load the
Winsock DLL whenever it needs to go online and will unload it as soon as
it is finished.  For this to work, it has to be able to find the Winsock
DLL; the easiest way to ensure that is to put the DLL's directory in
your PATH.</P>
<P>The final step is to configure your Winsock driver to automatically
connect and log in to your service provider when it is loaded, and to
disconnect when it is unloaded.  There are too many combinations of
Winsock drivers and connection methods for us to describe them all, but
we've included detailed instructions for Trumpet Winsock on our <A HREF="cswinsk.htm#TrumpetWinsock"
>Winsock Drivers</A> page.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="CTL3DV2"><B>What is CTL3DV2.DLL and how does Agent
install it?</B></A></P>
<P>CTL3DV2.DLL is a Microsoft DLL that gives dialog boxes that nifty 3D
look.  It is supposed to reside in either your <TT>\windows</TT> or
<TT>\windows\system</TT> directory.   Not all copies of Windows have
the file, so we ship <B>Agent</B> with a copy of it, so that we can
install it if necessary.  The copy we ship is called CTL3DV2.DL_.   We
didn't want you to have to run an installation program to get started
with <B>Agent</B>, so we try to be clever and install CTL3DV2.DLL when
you run
<B>Agent</B>, if necessary.  We do that by checking to see if
CTL3DV2.DLL is already in either your <TT>\windows</TT> or <TT>\windows\system</TT>
directory.  If it is not, we copy our version of the file into one of
those directories.</P>
<P>First, we try to copy it into the <TT>\windows\system</TT>
directory, because that's where Microsoft recommends putting it.  If we
are unable to write to that directory, then probably the reason for the
failure is that you are running a network copy of Windows, and don't
have rights to the system directory.  In that case, per Microsoft's
recommendations, we copy the file to the <TT>\windows</TT> directory.
</P>
<P>If you get the message "CTL3DV2 was not correctly installed" when
you start <B>Agent</B>, then it means that somehow a copy of
CTL3DV2.DLL got put in <B>Agent</B>'s working directory or in some
other directory on your path.   CTL3DV2 will display that message if you
try to run it out of any directory other than <TT>\windows</TT> or
<TT>\windows\system</TT>.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SetDataDir"><B>How do I specify the directory for Agent's
database?</B></A></P>
<P>Generally, Agent looks for its .INI and database files in the
directory it is run in. You normally set this with the <B>Working
Directory</B> field in the Program Manager icon's File Properties dialog
box.  There are several ways to override this and instruct Agent to
place its data files in another directory:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Agent now accepts a command line parameter to specify the location
of AGENT.INI.  If AGENT.INI is not in the working directory, then Free
Agent will place its data files in the directory containing AGENT.INI.
<P>To use the command line parameter, specify <KBD>agent.exe &lt;path&gt;</KBD>
on the command line.  The optional &lt;path&gt; argument can be either
the directory containing AGENT.INI or the name of the INI file to use as
AGENT.INI.</P>
<UL>
<LI>If no &lt;path&gt; is specified, Agent looks for AGENT.INI in the
current working directory.  If the file doesn't exist, Agent creates it.</LI>
<LI>If &lt;path&gt; is a filename, Agent uses that file as AGENT.INI. 
If the file doesn't exist, Agent creates it.</LI>
<LI>If &lt;path&gt; is a directory, Agent looks for AGENT.INI in the
specified directory.  If the file doesn't exist, Agent creates it. 
Note: If the directory doesn't exist, Agent assumes that you are
specifying a filename.  You can prevent this from happening by appending
a \ to the end of the directory name to force Agent to always treat it
as a directory. For example: <KBD>c:\agent\</KBD>.</LI>
</UL><P></P></LI>
<LI>You can also direct Agent to store its data files in a directory
OTHER than the one which contains AGENT.INI.  To do this, update the
[Directories] section of your AGENT.INI and fill in the "Home="
parameter.  Here is an excerpt from the online help which describes this
parameter.
<PRE>Home=
;The directory where Agents database files and custom dictionaries are
;stored.  If this parameters value is blank (the default), Agent looks
;for these files in the directory containing AGENT.INI.  Note: Changing
;this setting does not move your files.  Use File Manager to move all
;the files (*.IDX, *.DAT, and CUST*.TLX) to the new location and then
;restart Agent for this change to take effect.</PRE>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="DataDir"><B>Why is Agent putting files in the wrong
directory?</B></A></P>
<P>As explained in the <A HREF="#SetDataDir">data directory</A> topic,
when Agent is run it normally uses the current directory to store its
data files.  If you don't specify this, it will put them someplace you
don't want them, often in your root or Windows directory.</P>
<P>Several beta testers have noticed third-party shell programs or
desktop managers running <B>Agent</B> in unexpected working
directories, with the data files going into whatever directory that
turns out to be.  If the shell program doesn't run it in the same
directory each time, you'll also have the problem described in the next
section.</P>
<P>See the topic on <A HREF="#SetDataDir">data directory</A> for
specific instructions on how to set this.</P><HR>
<P><A NAME="LostSettings"><B>Why does Agent forget all my settings
each time I run it?</B></A></P>
<P>As explained in the section on the <A HREF="#SetDataDir">data
directory</A>, <B>Agent</B> expects to find its setting and data files
in the data directory.  If it can't find them, it assumes it is being
run for the first time and displays the registration screen.</P>
<P>You normally specify this directory in the <B>Working Directory</B>
field of the Program Manager icon that runs Agent, or through Agent's
command-line argument.  If you don't specify this directory, or if you
run Agent through some third-party shell that doesn't properly set the
working directory, it may run in a different directory than it did the
last time you ran it. If there are no data files in that directory,
you'll get the registration screen again.  (You'll also get a set of
files created in that directory, as explained in the <A HREF="#DataDir">previous</A>
section.)</P>
<P>See the topic on <A HREF="#SetDataDir">data directory</A> for
specific instructions on how to set this.</P><HR>
<P><A NAME="MultiUser"><B>How do I set up Agent for multiple users or
news servers?</B></A></P>
<P>As explained in the section on the <A HREF="#DataDir">data
directory,</A> <B>Agent</B> stores its setting and data files in the
directory specified in its command line or set by the Program Manager
when it runs. This means that you can share a single copy of the program
files among several independent data directories.</P>
<P>This works well for multiple people using the program, since each
directory can have a completely different set of preferences and
newsgroup files.  It also lets you use more than one news server; the
multiple directories are necessary because unless the two servers mirror
each other, different articles will be available on each at any given
time.  Also, the servers will no doubt use different numbering schemes,
making it impossible to track read/unread counts.</P>
<P>To do this, create a single directory to hold the program files that
you download from us.  Then create a separate directory for each user or
news server.  Finally, create a separate Program Manager icon for each,
with the <B>Command Line</B> field pointing to the program itself (<TT>c:\windows\agent\agent.exe</TT>,
for example) and the server directory (<TT>c:\windows\agent\george</TT>,
perhaps) specified as a command-line argument or in the <B>Working
Directory</B> field.  (See the topic on the <A HREF="#SetDataDir">data
directory</A> for specific instructions on setting this.)</P>

<H2>OS/2 Compatibility</H2>

<P>
Our beta testers have given us mixed reports about running <B>Free
Agent</B> under OS/2 3.0 (Warp). Some can't make it work at all,
while others are able to get it working more or less smoothly.
It's possible that at least some of the difficulties are caused
by <A HREF="csbugs.htm#OS2" >problems </A> in <B>Agent</B>, while
others may be setup problems in Warp. We intend to make <B>Agent</B>
work correctly under OS/2, so we are setting up an OS/2
installation ourselves to evaluate the compatibility issues. Since
it may be a while before we have conclusive information, we'll
summarize what our beta testers are reporting until we can supplement
it with our own findings.
<P>
Please understand that we are simply reporting information that
we can neither confirm nor test at the moment. These are unsubstantiated
reports from our users, supplemented by some Usenet browsing on
our part (no shortage of newsreaders here!).
<P>
A posting in the comp.os.os2.networking.tcp-ip newsgroup talked
about some general steps to make Winsock programs work with Warp's
Internet Access Kit (IAK):
<PRE>
If winsock programs don't work with the IAK check:
1. in autoexec.bat there is a line : 'SET ETC=C:\TCPIP\DOS\ETC'
2. in autoexec.bat PATH line C:\TCPIP\DOS\BIN is in front
3. there is no other WINSOCK.DLL in \WINDOWS or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM
4. in \TCPIP\DOS\ETC there is a file 'resolv'
5. in CONFIG.SYS there are lines saying:
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\inet.sys
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\ifndisnl.sys
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\vdostcp.vdd
      DEVICE=c:\tcpip\bin\vdostcp.sys
      RUN=c:\tcpip\bin\cntrl.exe
      RUN=c:\tcpip\bin\vdosctl.exe
</PRE>

<P>
One OS/2 user reported that he had trouble making <B>Free Agent
</B>run until he un-installed win32s, after which it worked fine.
We don't know why this might be the case, and we haven't heard
similar reports with Windows, but it might be worth trying.
<P>
Another user reported that <B>Free Agent</B> crashed right after
the startup graphics in Windows Enhanced mode, but worked fine
in Standard mode.
<P>
Several people have reported odd screen-related problems, usually
with <B>Free Agent</B> failing to completely obscure other windows
that should have been under it.  Most of them report that these
problems don't prevent <B>Free Agent</B> from working properly
otherwise.
<P>
One user reports success running <B>Free Agent</B> in a separate
seamless WinOS/2 session, and sent us a copy of his settings:

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Browsing and Reading</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><A NAME="RetrieveAll"><B>How do I mark and retrieve all articles
in certain groups?</B></A></P>
<P>There are two ways to do this:</P>
<P>If you want to do this on an ad-hoc basis after you've retrieved the
headers, press Ctrl+A to select all of the headers and then select <B>Online
| Get Marked Article Bodies</B>, or <B>Article | Mark for Retrieval.</B></P>
<P>If you <EM>always</EM> want to get the bodies automatically for a
particular group, select the group and use the <B>Group | Properties</B>
option to open the Group Properties dialog. On the Retrieving page,
check "Override default settings" and then check "Retrieve bodies for
all new articles."</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoMarkRead"><B>If  I retrieve new headers, but I don't
read any articles, how do I prevent the headers from being marked as
read?</B></A></P>
<P>By selecting <B>Group | Default Properties</B> (or <B>Properties</B>
if behavior is desired only in current group) and removing the X from
the "New Article Headers" box in the "Marking Articles Read" category.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="Ketchup"><B>What does the "Catch Up" option do?</B></A></P>
<P>Here's the question that one of our beta testers sent us:</P>
<PRE>> I was wondering if I could get an explanation of the function of the
> catching-up choice in the online menu.  If, after being away, you want
> to "catch-up" what is the difference in using this choice and the mark
> all articles as read choice?</PRE>
<P><B>Agent</B> remembers the number of the last article it has
retrieved from the news server.  When you "get new headers", <B>Agent</B>
gets all higher-numbered articles.  The <B>Online | Catch Up With
Selected Groups</B> command queries the server to find out the highest
number, but does not retrieve any headers, so that the next time you get
headers, you'll only get articles posted since you did the catch up.</P>
<P>The <B>Article | Mark All Articles Read</B> command simply marks as
read (changes them from red to black) all articles that you have already
retrieved.  It doesn't affect which articles <B>Agent</B> will retrieve
the next time you contact the server.</P>
<P>BTW, another way to "catch up" is to open the Default Group
Properties dialog and temporarily change the "Limit number of headers
per session" value.  That way, you can catch up by retrieving, say, no
more than 50 of the most recent articles per group.
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="AutoExpand"><B>How do the auto-thread-expand options
work?</B></A></P>
<P>There are two options on the <B>Navigation</B> tab of the <B>Options
| Preferences</B> dialog box that determine whether threads are
displayed in expanded or collapsed form:</P>
<UL><LI><B>Show threads initially Collapsed:</B>  If you check this
option, all threads will be shown collapsed when you first open a
newsgroup.  If you un-check it, they will all be shown expanded.</LI>
<LI><B>Automatically expand threads containing new articles:</B>  If
you check this option, threads will be expanded when you jump into them
with the "Skip to/View next unread" commands.  They're expanded <B>only</B>
if you've already retrieved and read the first article in the thread --
the idea here is to avoid expanding threads that you've never seen
before (and forcing you to step through them one article at a time). 
Only threads that you've previously shown an interest in are expanded.</LI></UL>
<P>This feature has been confusing a lot of our beta testers, and we're
looking at ways to make it simpler.  In addition, the option to
automatically expand threads when you jump into them doesn't seem to
work if you are in three-pane mode and have the focus in the body pane. 
Keep watching these pages.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="MarkJump">Why does it jump when I Mark or Ignore an
article?</A></B></P>
<P>This is caused by one of the new navigation features added in
version 0.46.  <B>Agent</B> automatically skips to the next unread
article when you mark an article for retrieval or ignore a thread.  If
you do not like this behavior, you can disable it by selecting <B>Options
| Preferences</B> and clicking on the <B>Navigation</B> tab.  Now click
on the <B>Marking or ignoring an article skips to the next unread
article</B> option to remove the check mark and press <B>OK</B> to
dismiss the dialog box.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoDate"><B>Why doesn't the date appear in the article
list?</B></A></P>
<P>Actually, the date does appear to the right of the article header. 
If you use the multi-paned view, it is probably off the right of your
screen.  Try using Zoom mode.  Choose the <B>Navigate | Zoom Window</B>
menu item, or click the maximize button in one of the individual panes.
 <B>Agent</B> is pretty smart about switching back and forth between
the panes automatically, and you can switch manually by clicking on the
tabs at the top of the window.
</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoDateAuthor"><B>Why don't I see the Date or Author
fields in the browser?  [Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P> Starting with <B>Agent</B> version .99a, we've made the Message
List pane sortable by Date, Author, Subject and Size, and allowed you to
select this by clicking on the respective column headers.  For example,
to sort by Author you just click on the header for the Author column.</P>
<P>However, this required us to change the format somewhat, by adding
an Author column instead of simply appending the author's name to the
end of the message subject as we previously did.  Depending on how you
have your screen layout set, this may cause some of the columns to not
fit in your window any more.  To see them again, Zoom the pane to fill
your screen and readjust the column widths by using the mouse to drag
the header separators to the desired location.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SmallStatus"><B>Why can't I make the status column
smaller?</B></A></P>
<P>In addition to the line count, the status column has to display all
of the article status icons (Mark, Watch, Ignore, Keep, Thread, Body).  
We've limited the minimum size of the column so that there is room for
all of these.  We found that if we didn't do that, new users would make
the column so small that some of the information would disappear and
then they'd get confused because it was missing.  You can also use the
Zoom command, which can be handy to make the article browser fill the
entire window and give you maximum width for the subject column.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NoHeader"><B>How do I suppress the header details when
I'm reading an article?</B></A></P>
<P>Remove the checkmark from the <B>Article | Show All Header Fields</B>
menu item (or use the right mouse button to bring up the speed menu and
remove the checkmark from the <B>Show All Header Fields</B> item). This
will start the article just after the header.</P>
<P>Note that this won't eliminate a header that somebody else quoted
and included in the article.  That makes it into part of the article
body, where it is always displayed.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="QuoteWrap"><B>Why does some word-wrapped quoted text
appear in the wrong color?</B></A></P>
<P>When you're viewing an article that contains quoted text, you may
sometimes notice that the text is word-wrapped and that the wrapped
lines appear in black instead of blue (or whatever color you've chosen
for quoted text).  This is actually a problem with the article itself,
not with <B>Agent</B>.</P>
<P>This happens when the newsreader that created the article decides to
word-wrap the quoted text and does not put a ">" at the beginning of the
wrapped lines.  Because they don't start with the quote character, <B>Agent</B>
has no way of knowing that they were originally part of the quote, and
so it displays them in black.  (To prevent you from perpetrating
erroneous quotations like this, <B>Agent</B> doesn't wrap quoted text. 
See the section on <A HREF="csfaqpst.htm#WordWrap">word-wrapping in the
editor</A> for more information about that.)</P>
<P>If <B>Agent</B> wraps part of a quoted line, it does not provide a
">" character but still displays it in blue.  It can do this because it
knows that the new line is really part of the quoted line above it.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="ReadWrap"><B>How does word-wrap work when I'm reading an
article?</B></A></P>
<P>The <B>Article | Word Wrap</B> menu item (or the <B>Word Wrap</B>
item on the speed menu that you get by clicking the right mouse button
while viewing an article) determines whether the article text is
displayed word-wrapped.  If word-wrap is on, all of the text will be
visible no matter how small your display window is, but it may be hard
to determine the article's original format.  If word-wrap is off, the
article will appear in its original format but you may have to use the
horizontal scroll bar to see all of it.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="LongTrunc"><B>Why do long articles appear to be
truncated?</B></A></P>
<P>If you download a very large article, the display may only show the
first part of it (the first 60,000 characters), followed by the message</P>
<PRE>[Sorry!
 This version of Agent cannot display articles longer than 60k bytes.
 We will remove this restriction in a later version.
 In the meantime, you can view the entire article by
 printing it or by saving it as a file.]</PRE>
<P>The entire article has actually been downloaded, and if you save or
print it, it will appear in its entirety.  The restriction affects only
the display, and will be fixed in a later release.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="NotAvail"><B>Why do I get "This article is no longer
available" errors?</B></A></P>
<P>This means that your news server no longer has the article that you
just tried to download.  This can easily happen if you have your purging
settings defined to keep article headers for a fixed number of days or
to never purge them at all (see the <B>Purging</B> tab on the
<B>Group | Properties</B> dialog box).  Because news servers keep
articles for an unpredictable amount of time, the only safe settings are
<B>Purge All</B> and <B>Purge articles no longer available on server</B>.</P>
<P>In earlier versions of Free Agent, misleading information from the
server could also cause this problem even if you had the <B>Purge
articles no longer available on server</B> option set.  The following
topic describes the reason for this and the fix that we implemented in
Free Agent 1.0 / Agent .99.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SlowRetrieve"><B>Why do the latest versions retrieve
headers more slowly?</B></A></P>
<P>One of Agent's purging options is "When the article is no longer
available on the server".   In previous versions (prior to Free Agent
1.0 / Agent .99), it would do this by checking the range of available
articles reported by the server and purging all articles whose numbers
were before the available range.  For example, if the server reported
that articles 204-566 were available, Agent would purge all articles
with numbers 203 or less.</P>
<P>But our beta testing showed that in many circumstances there would
be gaps in the reported range of articles.   This would typically happen
when one article was posted in a way that would cause it to remain on
the server much longer than normal.  This could happen if an article was
posted with an explicit expiration date, or if an article was
cross-posted.   (In many cases, cross-posted articles are not deleted
from any groups until they are deleted from all groups.)</P>
<P>These gaps would cause Agent to think that articles were still
available when they really weren't.  This would cause two problems for
the user.  First, you might try to retrieve the body for one of these
articles and then have Agent report that the article was <A HREF="#NotAvail"
>no longer available</A>.  Second, Agent would fail to purge large
numbers of articles if there were really big gaps in the range.</P>
<P>In the latest release of Agent, we solved these problems by having
Agent request a complete list of articles from the server.  With this
list, Agent is able to purge all articles no longer available, even if
there are gaps in the numbering range.  Agent gets the list of articles
as part of the get-new-headers operation, after it has retrieved header
information about new articles.</P>
<P>Our tests showed that retrieving a complete list of articles adds
only a few seconds to the retrieval time for most groups.  However, we
have also found that some news servers are very slow to return the
complete article list.  If you've noticed that Agent pauses during
get-new-headers, then you probably have one of those servers.  You can
eliminate the delays by turning off the <B>Always get complete list of
server's available articles</B> option on the <B>Group Properties |
What to Purge</B> dialog.  This will make Agent work the way it used to.
 The downside to turning off the option is that the "no longer
available" purging option may fail to purge all unavailable articles,
leading to the problems discussed above.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="SlowUpdate"><B>Why does it take so long to update a group
after retrieving headers?  [Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P>Agent now allows you to sort your newsgroups by Author, Date,
Subject and Size as well as by Thread.  However, it needs to have the
group in Thread order to insert new headers into it, so it can do things
like respect Ignored and Watched threads.  If you have the group sorted
by anything except Thread, Agent has to sort it into Thread order,
update it with the new headers, and then re-sort it back into your
original order.  On some systems this can take a considerable time,
especially with large newsgroups.</P>
<P>You can tell that this is happening if you have your newsgroup
sorted by something other than Thread, the actual header retrieval (with
the moving progress indicator) happens at the normal speed, and there is
then a very long pause while the status bar says "Updating
&lt;newsgroup&gt;".</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="TooMany"><B>What do I do about a "too many articles to
retrieve" error?  [Free Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P>This error message is displayed if the sum of the articles currently
in Free Agent's database for the group and the total number of new
articles that may be retrieved (i.e. the total number of articles in the
range of new articles available from the server) is greater than 32,000.
 Of course, the total number of articles you end up with after the
retrieval may be less than this.  For example, Free Agent may end up
purging some old articles, and there may be gaps in the range of
available articles.  But Free Agent has to prepare for the worst, which
entails allocating enough space to store all old and newly-retrieved
articles.  Here are the workarounds:</P>
<UL><LI>Tell Free Agent to retrieve a smaller number of articles.  
You can do this with the <B>Online | Sample...</B> menu option, or by
setting the <B>Limit number of headers retrieved per session</B>
parameter on the <B>Retrieving</B> tab on the <B>Group | Default
Properties for All Groups</B> dialog to a value like 15,000.  This works
well if this is the first time you have visited a group, and you are
thus trying to retrieve all available articles.  Once you're caught up,
the number of articles retrieved in future sessions will be much
smaller.  (And besides, you're probably not going to read 32,000
articles anyway!)</LI>
<LI>Do a manual purge before getting new articles.</LI></UL>
<P>(After the above was written, we made the software smarter so that
it displays the error only in the rare cases when there really <EM>will</EM>
be 32,000 articles after the download.  Because we did this between the
Free Agent 1.0 and Agent .99 releases, all Agent versions have the new,
improved logic but all Free Agent versions still have the old code.  The
fix will automatically be included in the next Free Agent release, but
for now Free Agent users may need the above workaround.)</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Posting</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><A NAME="Signature"><B>How do I have my signature added to the end
of my post?</B></A></P>
<P>The default signature is designated in the <B>Group | Default
Properties for All Groups</B> Dialog.  Select the "Posting" tab on this
dialog, and then select the signature you want as your default
signature. The signature is automatically attached to all documents that
you post or mail using Agent.</P>
<P>If you would like to set up different signatures for each group, you
may override the default by first selecting the group whose properties
you are overriding, and then select
<B>Group | Properties for Selected Groups</B>. Go to the "Posting" tab,
select "Override Default Settings", and then choose the signature to use
when posting from that group.</P>
<P>You can also override the default signature on an individual message
by pressing the "All Fields" button and changing the signature field.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="WhereSignature"><B>Why doesn't my signature appear in the
edit window?</B></A></P>
<P>Once you've set up your signature as described in <A HREF="#Signature">
the topic above</A>, you may be surprised when it still doesn't appear
in the edit window or in the messages in the Outbox.  Don't worry -
Agent appends the signature at the time that it sends the message,
although it never appends it to the part that you see.  If you want to
verify that Agent is going to append the correct signature to your post,
press the <B>All Fields</B> button.  The name of the signature that
Agent is going to use will appear in the <B>Signature</B> field.  If
you want to use something other than the default signature, you can
change it here.</P>
<P>As a future enhancement, we're considering changing Agent to add the
signature to the editable text in the message window.  This would allow
you to confirm that the signature really was there, and to edit it if
necessary.</P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="WordWrap"><B>How does word-wrap work when I'm editing an
article?</B></A></P>
<P>For outgoing messages, there are two parameters that control
wordwrap -- the <B>Message | Word Wrap</B> menu option, and the <B>Line
Length</B> option on the <B>Message Posting</B> tab of the <B>Preferences</B>
dialog box.</P>
<P>When a message is transmitted, only the <B>Line Length</B>
parameter is used.  All lines are wrapped at <B>Line Length</B>
characters (remember, posted messages are inherently "fixed-pitch"),
with one exception:  Lines that begin with one of the quote characters
are not wrapped, based on the assumption that the original text was
formatted correctly (or, at least the way the author wanted) to begin
with.</P>
<P>The display in the editing window itself is also affected by the <B>Word
Wrap</B> option.  Lines will still wrap at the <B>Line Length</B>
setting (unless they're quoted), but if <B>Word Wrap</B> is set then
all lines also wrap as necessary to make them fit in the window.  If you
don't set <B>Word Wrap</B>, then lines may be wider than the window and
you'll have to scroll horizontally to see parts of them.</P>
<P>If you want to see exactly what the message will look like when it's
posted, select a fixed-pitch font, make sure your window is wide enough
to display <B>Line Length</B> characters, and turn off <B>Word Wrap</B>.
 OTOH, if you have a very narrow window and just want to see the text
without worrying about the final format, turn <B>Word Wrap</B> on,
select the font of your choice, and type away.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="SlowEdit">Why is editing an article sometimes so slow?</A></B></P>
<P>Because of some inefficiencies in our word-wrapping algorithm, the
response can sometimes be very slow when typing characters into the
middle of a large article.  We will be addressing this in a later
release.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="PostFail">Do I have to re-type a failed post?</A></B></P>
<P>No.  Whenever you attempt to post a message, <B>Agent</B> saves it
in the out-box.  This means that if the post fails for any reason, the
message is still there and you can try to post it later.  To do this,
select the <B>Online | Post Articles and Emails</B> menu option.</P>
<P>To see the contents of the out-box, select <B>Window | Open Outbox
Window</B>.  All of the articles and email messages that you have
entered will be there, with icons to show whether their posting was
successful.  A yellow smiling face means that the article was posted
successfully, while a red frowning face means that the posting failed
and will be tried again the next time you select the <B>Post Articles
and Emails</B> menu option.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="0lines">Why are my posts listed as having 0 lines?</A></B></P>
<P> Agent doesn't set the Lines field (the field that tells how many
lines there are in the article) when posting an article, because we
thought all news servers added it automatically.  It turns out that some
don't, so any article posted through them will end up with a header
claiming that it has 0 lines.  The article text is still there and can
still be viewed, but many newsreaders will display it in the browser
with a line count of 0.</P>
<P>This problem will be fixed in a later release.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Miscellaneous (Part 2)</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><P><B><A NAME="ReceiveSMTP">How do I receive email via SMTP? 
[Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>In general, it is impractical for a program like Agent to receive
email using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), although that is the
protocol used to send mail.  A conventional SMTP server has no provision
for queueing email for later retrieval, so Agent would have to be online
24 hours a day to avoid missing messages.  For this reason almost all
service providers use the POP3 protocol for transferring email to their
users, and that is the default protocol that Agent uses.</P>
<P>However, a few service providers (most notably Demon in the U.K.)
have implemented an unconventional SMTP server that <EM>does</EM> queue
email, and that's how they provide incoming mail to their users.  If
your service provider has such a setup, you must go to the <B>System
Profile</B> tab of the <B>Options | Inbound Email</B> dialog box and
set the <B>Receive email with SMTP</B> option.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="MoveOut">How can I move items from the Outbox to a
Folder?  [Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>Agent 99a does not allow you to move items from the Outbox to a
folder.  This will be added in the next interim release that you receive
(along with some other features that round out the basic email
functionality).</P>
<P>In future versions, Agent will automatically route messages to a
default folder that you specify.    The Outbox will become just a
repository for items that are waiting to be sent - and once they are
successfully sent, they will be copied to a folder of your choice.  From
this default folder, you'll be able to move/copy to other folders if
desired (as well as print and sort!).</P>
<P>We are also considering some automatic routing schemes for your
outbound mail, similar to the inbound mail filtering that Agent already
does.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="ImportEmail">Can I import my existing email database
into Agent?  [Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>If you're currently using Eudora or Pegasus as your email package,
we have written converter programs that allow you to import your
existing database into Agent.  The programs are available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/eudora.zip"
>ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/eudora.zip</A> and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/pegasus.zip"
>ftp.forteinc.com/pub/forte/converters/pegasus.zip</A>, respectively,
and each includes a readme.txt file that describes how to use it.</P>
<P>These programs work by reading your existing database and writing a
text file that you can import into Agent with the <B>File | Import
Messages</B> menu option.  They will preserve any existing trays,
folders, and mailboxes that you had set up, converting them to Agent
folders.</P>
<P>We will add converters for other email packages according to demand
(and resources).  You can import new messages at any time without
disturbing your existing folders and messages, so you don't need to wait
for a converter before switching to Agent.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="CantImport">Why can't I select the  "Import Messages"
menu item?  [Agent only]</A></B></P>
<P>The <B>File | Import Messages</B> option is grayed if you have
never run the <B>Options | Inbound Email</B> dialog box to configure
the system for email.  This is because import won't work until you've
designated a default inbound email folder.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="ManFolders">How does the "Manage Folders" menu work?</A></B></P>
<P>When you select either the <B>Copy</B> or <B>Move to Folder</B>
menu option the "flyout" menu will list up to nine folders that you have
specified, followed by a menu option "All Folders...".   You should put
the folders that you copy or move messages to most frequently on the
flyout menu so that they are easily accessible.  </P>
<P>To configure the flyout menu, select <B>Options | Manage Folder
Menus</B>.   There are two listboxes shown on the <B>Manage Folder
Menus</B> dialog box.  The left-most one shows a list of all folders
that aren't already displayed on the menu.   The right-most one shows
the folders that do appear on the menu.   To add a folder to the menu,
select a folder from the <B>Folder</B> listbox and click on <B>Add</B>.
 The folder name will appear in the <B>Menu</B> listbox.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="VersionEnvy">Why are some people posting with more
recent versions than I have?</A></B></P>
<P>If you think you're running the most recent version of <B>Agent</B>
or <B>Free Agent</B>, you may sometimes be surprised to see a newsgroup
posting by somebody with a higher version number than you have.  What's
happening here - are these people somehow special?  Why do they have
something that you don't have?</P>
<P>There are several possible reasons for this.  You might have missed
a release announcement and still be using outdated software.  See our
<A HREF="csrelhst.htm">Release History</A> page to make sure you
haven't missed anything.</P>
<P>If you're using the latest public version, something else is
obviously happening.  The post may have come from someone who is
beta-testing a new version that we will be releasing in the near future,
or they may have a special version that fixes a specific bug they were
encountering.  If the posting came from Fort&eacute;
(somebody@forteinc.com) then they're probably just using an internal
development version that hasn't even made it to beta yet.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="WhereFeature">Where are the features that I thought
would be in the Agent .99a release?</A></B></P>
<P>Depending on the feature in question, there are two possible
answers:</P>
<DL><DT><B>It isn't email</B></DT>
<DD>This is the basic <EM>Email</EM> release, so many non-email
features like kill lists and crossposted-article handling aren't
included.  They're not scheduled until the final Agent 1.0 release this
fall, although some may appear in earlier releases (as message sorting
appeared in this release).<P></P></DD>
<DT><B>It isn't basic email</B></DT>
<DD>This is the <EM>basic</EM> Email release, intended to get user
feedback on our core email functionality.  As such, many features that
aren't strictly necessary have been deferred to later releases so that
we could get this one to you as soon as possible.</DD></DL>
<P>The following features will be included in upcoming releases:</P>
<P><B>First Email Upissue</B> (due out very soon)</P>
<UL><LI><B>Basic Outbox management</B> - manually move messages from
the Outbox to folders.</LI>
<LI><B>Binary decoding</B> - automatically decode binary attachments
in incoming email.</LI></UL>
<P><B>Advanced Email Upissue</B></P>
<UL><LI><B>Address book</B> - individuals and mailing lists.</LI>
<LI><B>MIME support</B> - handle international characters and
MIME-encoded attachments.</LI>
<LI><B>Expanded Outbox management</B> - automatically place outbound
email  in folders</LI></UL>
<P><B>Final Agent 1.0 Release</B></P>
<UL><LI><B>Kill and Watch lists</B> - ignore or read all messages
from specified authors or subjects.</LI>
<LI><B>Crossposted message management</B> - only have to read
crossposted messages once.</LI>
<LI><B>Filtering</B> - see only unread articles, articles with bodies,
etc.</LI>
<LI><B>Etc.</B> - all other features listed on the <A HREF="agent.htm#Features"
>Agent page</A> that haven't been included in previous releases.</LI></UL>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="DialupCancel">How do I cancel a connection attempt
that's obviously failing?</A></B></P>
<P>(From some of the bug reports we've seen, a better title for this
one might be "Why doesn't <B>Agent</B> have a Cancel button on the
"Connecting to Server" dialog box?")</P>
<P>The "Connecting to Server" dialog box appears during the period of
time when <B>Agent</B> has passed control to the underlying winsock
driver, during the first call to the driver after it is loaded.  Whether
or not this happens during the dial-in phase depends on the particular
winsock driver you are using.  If you are using the Trumpet winsock, the
dial-in occurs as a side-effect of the first winsock call, which won't
return to <B>Agent</B> until the call either succeeds or fails.</P>
<P>That's why there is no cancel button on the dialog box - <B>Agent</B>
isn't in control of the process at this point, and has no way to tell
the winsock driver to cancel the connection attempt.  With Trumpet
Winsock, as far as we know at present, the only way to cancel the call
is to go to TCPMAN and press ESC.  That will cancel the connection
attempt and return control to <B>Agent</B>.</P>

<!DOCTYPE HTML SYSTEM "html.dtd">
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: Miscellaneous</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><P><B><A NAME="Binary">How do I decode and view binary files?</A></B></P>
<P>(This discussion is taken almost verbatim from the "How to Retrieve
a Binary Attachment" section of our online help.  Whenever you don't
know how to do something, the "How To" button on the Help toolbar is
always a good place to start.)</P>
<P>The latest release of <B>Agent</B> has a greatly improved process
for retrieving, decoding, and viewing binary files.  You can now get
multiple binaries in a single operation, and bypass most of the manual
steps that were necessary in our first release.  To retrieve (and
optionally view) a binary posting from a newsgroup, follow the steps
below:</P>
<OL><LI><P><B>Select the binary file(s) you want:</B>  Select at
least one article from each binary file you want to retrieve.  In most
cases, <B>Agent</B> will be able to find all of the other articles that
contain parts of the binary file.</P><P>If you select articles for more
than one binary file, <B>Agent</B> will retrieve all of the articles
for all of the files you selected.</P></LI>
<LI><P><B>Retrieve or view the files:</B>  Choose either <B>File |
Save Binary Attachments</B> or <B>File | Launch Binary Attachments</B>.
 </P><P>If you are configured for online operation, <B>Agent</B> will
immediately begin downloading and decoding the binary attachments. If
you selected the Launch... option, it will automatically run the Windows
application associated with the attachment's file type.</P><P>If you
are configured for offline operation, <B>Agent</B> will mark all
articles containing the attachments for later downloading.  The next
time you select the <B>Online | Get Marked Article Bodies</B> menu
item,<B>Agent</B> will download and decode the attachments.</P></LI></OL>
<P>Regardless of whether you chose the Save... or Launch... option, <B>Agent</B>
will store the binary files in the directory entered in the
<B>Attachments</B> tab of the <B>Group | Default Properties...</B>
dialog box, unless you've overridden that with the <B>Group |
Properties...</B> dialog box for the specific group you're in.</P>
<P><B><A NAME="ManDecode">If the automatic process doesn't work:</A></B></P>
<P>Occasionally, you may find multi-part attachments whose subject
lines don't match the standard conventions (they might not include the
standard "Part 1 of 2" or "[1/2]" notation, for example).  In this case,
<B>Agent</B> won't be able to find all of the articles for the file or
won't be able to get them in the correct order.  This may announce
itself with a dialog box saying that <B>Agent</B> couldn't find all of
the articles, or with an error during the decoding process.</P>
<P>To decode such files, you'll need to select and order the articles
manually:</P>
<OL><LI>Select <EM>all</EM> of the articles that contain parts of the
binary file.  You can do this by selecting one article and then
Ctrl-clicking on the others to include them.  Be sure to select articles
for only one binary file; you'll have to repeat this entire process for
any others that you want.</LI>
<LI>Select the <B>File | Manually Save Binary Attachment</B> meu item.</LI>
<LI><B>Agent</B> will display a dialog box showing the articles you
selected.  Make sure they are all in order - if they aren't, use the Up
and Down buttons to order them correctly.</LI>
<LI>Launch or save the attachment by pressing the corresponding button.
 If you are offline and have not yet retrieved the articles, <B>Agent</B>
will immediately go online and download them.</LI></OL>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="BinEmail"><B>How do I decode binary attachments in
incoming email?  [Agent only]</B></A></P>
<P>The current release (.99b) doesn't include support for decoding
binary attachments in email - that is one of the features that will be
added in the next interim release.  Until that release appears, you can
decode binary attachments by using the <B>File | Save Messages As...</B>
menu option to save the message to a text file and then using an
external decoding program like Wincode to extract the attachment.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="WhenPurge">When do articles get purged?</A></B></P>
<P>Like most things in <B>Agent</B>, this is configurable.  By
default, <B>Agent</B> purges outdated articles from a group each time
you tell it to download new headers for the group, which you do with the
various <B>Get ... Headers</B> commands in the <B>Online</B> menu.</P>
<P>You can also choose to have articles purged whenever you close <B>Agent</B>,
so that old articles will be gone the next time you start up.</P>
<P>This means that when you're through browsing a group, your articles
aren't purged when you leave the group as they are with most other
newsreaders.  Instead they persist at least until you close <B>Agent</B>,
and perhaps until the next time you go online to get new headers, which
might be several days later.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="WhichPurge">How do I control which articles are
purged?</A></B></P>
<P>Whenever <B>Agent</B> is purging articles for a group, it examines
each article to see if it should be deleted.  It makes this decision
based on the settings in the <B>What to Purge</B> page of the <B>Properties...</B>
and <B>Default Properties...</B> dialog boxes (reached through the <B>Group</B>
menu).</P>
<P>These dialog boxes allows you to set different criteria for deleting
articles depending on whether you've previously downloaded the article
body and whether you've read the article.  For example, most people set
these options so that articles with their full text are kept longer than
mere headers, since these are the articles that interested them enough
to read in the first place.</P>
<P>There are two main sections on this dialog box - one for articles
that you've already read, and one for articles that are still marked
unread.  Within each section, there are separate options for articles
without bodies (i.e. headers only) and articles  that do have bodies
(i.e. whose text you've previously downloaded).</P>
<P>You can choose to have articles with no bodies deleted:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT><B>When they're no longer available on the
server</B></DT>
<DD>This option automatically deletes all headers that the news server
has already deleted  from its own list of articles.  Selecting this
option makes the list of articles displayed by <B>Agent</B> a mirror
image of the articles that are available from the server.  This is
probably the best option for  most groups.</DD>
<DT><B>When they're older than a specified threshold</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes headers based on their age.</DD>
<DT><B>On every purge</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes the headers on every purge.  Selecting this
will make <B>Agent</B> work like most other newsreaders, although we
think that negates one of our big advantages.</DD>
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For articles that do have bodies, you have the following options:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL>
<DT><B>On every purge</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes the articles before downloading any new
headers.  As with headers, selecting this will make <B>Agent</B> work
like most other newsreaders.</DD>
<DT><B>On every purge, delete bodies only</B></DT>
<DD>This is like the previous option, but leaves the header in the
database so that you can download the article again if you choose.</DD>
<DT><B>When they're older than a specified threshold</B></DT>
<DD>This option deletes articles based on their age.  You might specify
that you want articles with bodies kept for 30 days, and manually set
the "Keep" flag for any that you don't want automatically purged.</DD>
<DT><B>Never</B></DT>
<DD>If you select this option, <B>Agent</B> will never automatically
delete articles.  They'll accumulate until you delete them manually, or
until something causes their purging status to change.  (For example,
you might set unread articles to never be deleted, but read articles to
be deleted after 30 days.  This means that an unread article would never
be purged, but when you read it it will then be purged after 30 days.)</DD></DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Regardless of how you set the above options, you can always override
them for an individual article.  If you want to delete an article before
its time, simply delete it manually.  If you want to keep an article
longer, set its "Keep" flag and <B>Agent</B> will never automatically
delete it.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="OrdinaryPurge">How do I make purging work like other
newsreaders?</A></B></P>
<P><B>Agent</B> maintains an intelligent database of headers and
articles that persists from session to session.  This provides many
advantages over traditional newsreaders, like letting you see new
messages in context with older ones.  We strongly suggest that you try
using this for a while before deciding  to disable it; most of the
people here who use <B>Agent</B> wonder how we ever lived without it.</P>
<P>However, this feature does come at a cost in both downloading speed
and disk space usage, and it just isn't the way some people want to
work.  Here's how to make <B>Agent</B> behave very much like ordinary
newsreaders:</P>
<OL><LI>First, decide whether you want to revert to "ordinary"
behavior in all newsgroups or just some.<UL>
<LI>If you want to change all newsgroups, select the <B>Group |
Default Properties...</B> menu option.</LI>
<LI>If you want to change only certain groups, select them all in the
Groups pane and then select the <B>Group | Properties...</B> menu
option</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>Whichever version of Step 1 you perform, you will now have a
version of the Group Properties dialog box displayed.  Select the <B>What
to Purge</B> tab to bring up the first set of options.</LI>
<LI>If you're doing this for a subset of the groups, there will be an
<B>Override default settings</B> field at the top of the dialog box.
Click on this field until an X appears in the box.</LI>
<LI>There are four main fields in the dialog box:  <B>Read Articles
Without Bodies</B>, <B>Read Articles With Bodies</B>, <B>Unread
Articles Without Bodies</B>, and <B>Unread Articles With Bodies</B>. 
Select the <B>On every purge</B> option in <EM>all</EM> fields.</LI>
<LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button at the bottom of the dialog box.</LI></OL>
<P><B>Agent</B> will now behave much more like an ordinary newsreader.
 Whenever you download new headers for a group, it will delete all of
the existing headers and articles in that group (except those that
you've explicitly set to Keep), so that you see only the new ones. 
These new articles will remain in the database until the next time you
download more headers.</P>
<P>For an even closer simulation of a conventional newsreader, follow
the steps above and then continue on:</P>
<OL><LI>Select the <B>When to Purge</B> tab on the <B>Preferences</B>
dialog box</LI>
<LI>Go to the <B>When to Purge</B> section, remove the check from the
<B>When Retrieving new headers</B> option, and check the <B>When
Closing Agent</B> option instead.</LI>
<LI>Click the <B>OK</B> button at the bottom of the dialog box.</LI></OL>
<P><B>Agent</B> will now behave as much like an ordinary newsreader as
it can.  It will now delete all headers and messages in all newsgroups
whenever you close it, so the newsgroups will always be empty each time
you start the program (again, except for articles you've chosen to
Keep).</P>
<HR> 
<P><B><A NAME="ErrServer">Server Errors: 400 - 599</A></B></P>
<P>These are errors that the news server reports to <B>Agent</B> after
the connection has been completed.</P>
<DL><DT><B>441 400 Bad file number Writing history file - Throttling</B></DT>
<DT><B>441 400 loadav [innwatch.load] 305 gt 300</B></DT>
<DT><B>441 Can't send connect request to server, No such File or
Directory
</B></DT>
<DD>These errors all mean that the news server has an internal problem
unrelated to anything you are doing.  Contact your service provider to
have it fixed.  When this happens, <B>Agent</B> saves the article you
were trying to post in its Outbox  (File | Open Outbox Window), so that
you can try to send it again later, after your news server is working
properly.</DD>
<DT><B>441 Can't generate Message-ID Error 0
</B></DT>
<DD>The error is generated internally by the server either if the
server is unable to obtain the current date and time (from itself), or
if it is unable to find out its OWN host name.  All of this happens
after <B>Agent</B> has posted the article to the server.  We recommend
that you contact your service provider and tell them about the error,
since it indicates a problem with their server.</DD>
<DT><B>441 Posted in the Future</B></DT>
<DD>This error means the date/time on the article, as sent by <B>Agent</B>,
is more than 24 hours later than the current date/time on the news
server.   You should double-check your PC's date and time, and the
timezone setting in <B>Agent</B> (on the <B>System Profile</B> page of
the <B>Preferences</B> dialog box).</DD>
<DT><B>441 437 Unwanted news group</B></DT>
<DD>The error means that the newsgroup is not carried by the news
server.  Perhaps this is a group that used to be carried and was
dropped.</DD>
<DT><B>480 Authentication required for command error trying to post</B></DT>
<DD>This error means that your news server requires you to provide
authentication before you can post.  You need to check with your service
provider to find out exactly what is required.  In most cases, you need
to supply the server a user name and password.  Once you get this
information from your provider, you can enter it on the <B>User Profile</B>
page of the <B>Preferences</B> dialog box.</DD>
<DT><B>500 Command not Recognized
</B></DT>
<DD>Your news server is not configured to handle a command issued by
<B>Agent</B> (usually the XOVER or the XHDR commands for retrieving
information about articles).   <B>Agent</B> requires that the server
accept one of these commands.   You will need to contact your service
provider and see if they can provide a server that honors these
commands.
</DD>
<DT><B>500 Error trying to connect to server
</B></DT>
<DD>This error  means that <B>Agent</B> is attempting to log you into
your news server, but your server doesn't actually require a login.  Go
to the <B>User Profile</B> page of the <B>Preferences </B>dialog box
and uncheck the <B>Server requires authorization login</B> option.</DD>
<DT><B>502 Authentication Error</B></DT>
<DD>Check to see if your news server really requires authentication. 
If it doesn't or if you are not sure, open the <B>Preferences</B>
dialog box, go to the <B>User Profile</B> page, and uncheck  the <B>Server
requires authorization login</B> option.  If you know that your server
<EM>does</EM> require authentication, double-check your <B>User Name</B>
and <B>Password</B> on this dialog box.</DD>
<DT><B>502 You are not in my access file</B></DT>
<DT><B>502 You only have permission to transfer</B></DT>
<DT><B>502 You have no permission to talk</B></DT>
<DD>These all indicate that you are not properly set up as an
authorized user of the news server.  You will have to contact your
service provider or news administrator to get this corrected.</DD>
<DT><B>550 Addressee unknown</B></DT>
<DD>Usually, this means you tried to send an email to someone whose
email address was unknown to the email server, and the server refused to
try to forward the mail to another server.
</DD></DL>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="ErrWinsock">Winsock Errors: 10000 - 11999</A></B></P>
<P>These are errors that your Winsock driver reports to <B>Agent</B>,
and usually indicate problems with the connection process.</P>
<DL><DT><B>10036 WSAEINPROGRESS</B></DT>
<DD>This occurs primarily with Spry (Internet in a box, CompuServe CID)
dialers. If you're using <B>Free Agent</B> version 0.55 or earlier,

drivers.</DD>
<DT><B>10050, <A NAME="Error20050">20050</A> WSAENETDOWN</B></DT>
<DD>We have some new information from Novell regarding the errors 10050
and 20050 (WSAENETDOWN).   This was an error in their first version of
winsock.dll and it is fixed in the most recent version available in
LWP42T.EXE on ftp.novell.com.  Also, not having the file NOVASYNC.EXE in
\net\bin or in your path will cause this error.  This file provides the
asynchronous support for Novell's winsock.dll.</DD>
<DT><B>10055 WSAENOBUFS</B></DT>
<DD>There is not enough memory available for WINSOCK.DLL to create any
buffers for <B>Agent</B>.  The problem is with low memory (memory below
640k), not overall memory.  Free up more conventional memory.</DD>
<DT><B>10060 WSAETIMEOUT
</B></DT>
<DD>This may be a case where <B>Agent</B> loads the winsock.dll, but
the winsock driver fails to load. Try loading the driver prior to
<B>Agent</B>. If this works, then make sure the winsock driver is in
the DOS path. You may also need to free more conventional memory.</DD>
<DT><B>10061 Connection refused by server</B></DT>
<DD>This error means that the server is either too busy to accept more
connections, or possibly has been taken down for maintenance.</DD>
<DT><B>11002 Host name not found</B></DT>
<DD>This errror indicates that the name lookup failed, but that it
might succeed if you try again.  If you set the following AGENT.INI
option, Agent will do just that, until it times out.<BR><TT>	[Online]<BR>
  	RetryGetHostName=1</TT><BR>If that doesn't work, replace the news
server's domain name with its IP address, in the <B>System Profile</B>
page of the <B>Options | Preferences</B> dialog box, so as to skip the
name lookup.</DD>
<DT><B>11004 Host Name not Found</B></DT>
<DD>This error means that the Winsock driver was unable to find the
host name for your news (NNTP) or mail (SMTP) server.  Double-check the
name of these servers in the <B>System Profile</B> page of the <B>Options
| Preferences</B> dialog box.   Usually, they will be something like
"news.company.com" and "mail.company.com", where "company.com" is your
provider's domain name.  As a workaround, try entering the numeric (IP)
address for the servers.<BR>This error can also occur if you run out of
low memory.  Try closing another application or try loading your dialer
and connecting to your news server before running <B>Agent</B>.</DD>
<DT><B>11004 No Data of Requested type</B></DT>
<DD>An error occurred during initialization of the Winsock driver.
Check your Winsock driver setup.</DD>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FAQ: CompuServe</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P><B><A NAME="Servers">What names do I use for the news and mail
servers?</A></B></P>
<P>The simple answer is to use <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> for the
news server and <TT>mail.compuserve.com</TT> for the mail server. 
However, <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> may cause some trouble for you,
especially if you use <B>Agent</B> in offline mode.  See the following
topic for a discussion of the problem and its solution.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="PhysicalServers">Why do I get "This article is no
longer available" errors?</A></B></P>
<P>In addition to the <A HREF="csfaqrd.htm#NotAvail">normal reasons</A>
for getting this error, there is another problem that only affects
CompuServe users.  As it turns out, <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> is
sort of a virtual address, and when you connect to it you get randomly
connected to one of six physical servers they have installed to handle
the load.  These servers are mostly synchronized with each other, but it
seems to take several hours for articles to reach all six of them.</P>
<P>This means that if you get headers from one server, go offline and
mark them, and then connect to a different server to download them, you
may get "Article not available on server" errors for some of the most
recent articles.</P>
<P>The solution is to always connect to the same server, so that you're
always presented with a consistent set of articles.  You can do this by
using one of the physical server names listed below, thus bypassing the
random-connection mechanism.</P>
<P>Note that this problem primarily affects <B>Agent</B> in offline
mode.  Now that CompuServe has the servers synchronized to within
several hours of each other (and using the same article numbers), you
may be able to use <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT> reliably in online
mode.  That address is a problem only when you go offline between
downloading headers and bodies, and your online browsing style may
prevent that from ever happening.  If so, you may gain reliability and
performance by using <TT>news.compuserve.com</TT>, since the switching
mechanism should connect you to the best available server.</P>
<P>If you decide that you do want to use one of the physical servers,
open the <B>Preferences</B> dialog box, go to the
<B>System Profile</B> page, and set the <B>News Server</B> field to
one of the names below:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>dub-news-svc-1.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-2.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-3.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-4.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-5.compuserve.com
dub-news-svc-6.compuserve.com
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Once you've done this, disconnect from the server, select all of the
newsgroups you follow, and do an <B>Online | Get All Headers in
Selected Groups</B> operation.  This will download <EM>all</EM> of the
headers for your groups, without regard for their article numbers, and
will delete any that are duplicates of ones you've already downloaded. 
It will also reset the article-number counters so that you'll be able to
properly retrieve new articles in the future.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="NoGroup">Why are some newsgroups missing?</A></B></P>
<P>If you've been using a CIS newsreader like WinCIM to do your Usenet
reading, you may discover that you can't access some of your regular
newsgroups through <B>Agent</B>.  If this happens, the first thing to
do is to make sure you have the very latest newsgroup list from the
server.  To do this, select the <B>Online | Get New Groups</B> menu
option. </P>
<P>If it still doesn't appear, that means the CompuServe server doesn't
carry that newsgroup.  The CIS readers use a different server than the
NNTP servers that <B>Agent</B> (and all other Winsock newsreaders) do,
and the two sets of servers don't seem to carry the same newsgroups. 
You'll have to ask CompuServe to start carrying your newsgroup on their
NNTP servers.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="TypeGroup">Can I just type the name of a missing
newsgroup?</A></B></P>
<P>The CIS newsreaders allowed you to type in the name of a newsgroup
if it didn't appear in the group list.  This is because they don't
display the names of all available groups, so that is the only mechanism
to access some of them.</P>
<P>Because <B>Agent</B> always displays all the newsgroups available
on the server (if its copy of the list is up to date; do an <B>Options
| Get New Groups</B> if it isn't), there is no facility for manually
entering a group name.  If it doesn't appear in the list, then the
server doesn't carry it.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="RecEmail">Can I receive email with Agent?  [Agent
only]</A></B></P>
<P>At the moment, you can't use <B>Agent</B> to receive email through
CompuServe.  The problem is that CompuServe doesn't provide a POP3
server, but automatically routes all incoming email to your CIS account.
 We have heard reports that they will offer such service in the future,
in which case <B>Agent</B> should be compatible with it.</P>
<HR>
<P><B><A NAME="Forums">Which forums carry discussions about Agent?</A></B></P>
<P>Our official support area is Section 20 of the Windows Connectivity
(<TT>GO WINCON</TT>) forum.  We monitor this regularly, replying to
user questions, and upload the most recent versions of <B>Agent</B> and
the downloadable FAQs in the library there.</P>
<P>We also monitor the Internet Resources (<TT>GO INETRE</TT>) and
Internet New User (<TT>GO INETNEW</TT>) forums, and respond to user
questions there as well.  (We no longer provide suport in the
NetLauncher Support forum (<TT>GO NLSUPPORT</TT>), as we've been
advised that it's inappropriate there.)  If you want to post a question
in one of these forums, it's best to include the word <B>Agent</B> in
the Subject line so that we'll be sure to see it.</P>

<p><hr>
<a name="A"><b>Wat is Pine?</b></a>
<hr><p>
Het gebruik van elektronische post (e-mail) staat borg voor een snelle en 
gemakkelijke
communicatie zowel op lokaal als op mondiaal niveau. Het gebruik van e-mail neemt met
de dag toe en heeft een ingrijpende impact op onderricht en vorming, research, 
gezondheidszorg, administratie en het zaken doen. Hoewel Pine een behoorlijk 
gesofistikeerd programma is, laat het zich toch makkelijk gebruiken. Het 
werd aan 
de University of Washington gecre&euml;erd met de nieuwe e-mail-gebruikers als doelgroep.

<p>Pine biedt onder andere:
<blockquote>
	On-screen menu's en boodschappen: Onderaan elk scherm zijn opties
	en menu's zichtbaar gemaakt, zodat geen commando's gememoriseerd
	hoeven te worden. 
<p>
	Online Help: De help-functie is ogenblikkelijk in staat je in te lichten 
	over de aard van de taak die uitgevoerd wordt.
</blockquote> 

<p>
<hr>
<a name="B"><b>Over dit document</b></a>
<hr>
<p>Onderhavig document kan best op het scherm worden geraadpleegd 
terwijl je Pine aan het gebruiken bent. De hier volgende tekst 
vertelt je niet alles over Pine. Hij beperkt zich tot een introductie over de 
belangrijkste mogelijkheden van Pine, en vat de basisrichtlijnen van e-mail samen. 
Met Pine leren werken doe je vooral door zelf het programma te exploreren. 
Pine is speciaal ontworpen om je met een minimum aan inspanningen met 
e-mail te leren omgaan: op elk scherm kan informatie geraadpleegd worden, en de
Online Help functie beantwoordt vragen of zet je op de goede weg. 
Probeer gerust alle mogelijkheden uit en amuseer je door er met Pine op los te 
experimenteren.
<p><hr>
<a name="C"><b>Vooraleer met Pine van start te gaan</b></a>
<hr><p>
Om met Pine te kunnen e-mailen moet je eerst over een gebruikers-ID (een account)
op een computer beschikken en vervolgens inloggen.
<p><hr>
<a name="D"><b>Pine opstarten en sluiten</b></a>
<hr><p>
Opstarten: Eerst inloggen. Na het verschijnen van de Unix-prompt  
tik je <code>pine[return]</code>. Wanneer Pine dan opgestart is, verschijnt het Hoofdmenu.
Elk Pine-scherm heeft een gelijkaardige opmaak: de bovenste regel geeft
je de naam van het scherm plus bijkomende nuttige informatie. Daaronder bevindt zich 
het eigenlijke werkgebied (in het hoofdmenu is dat het optie-menu), 
vervolgens de bericht/prompt-lijn en tenslotte het commando-menu.
<p>
Sluiten: Om Pine te verlaten tik je <code>q</code> <i>(quit)</i>. Meer hierover in <a href="#Q">Pine 
sluiten en uitloggen</a>.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="E"><b>Een bericht in Pine schrijven</b></a>
<hr>
<p>
Het hoofdmenu geeft een lijst van de belangrijkste Pine-opties (zie figuur 1). 
De letter die je intikt om je keuze te bepalen bevindt zich 
links van elke optie of elk commando.
<p>Je kan gewoonlijk zowel hoofd- als gewone letters gebruiken, en om commando's te
lanceren dien je niet op <code>[enter]</code> te duwen.
<p>Vanuit het hoofdmenu kan je online-hulp raadplegen, een bericht schrijven of ontvangen,
naar een index van je mailberichtjes kijken, je postbussen openen en 
in orde houden, je adresboek bijwerken, Pine configureren en opwaarderen en Pine
afsluiten.<p>

Figuur 1.  Een Pine-hoofdmenu-scherm

<p>
Nu je door hebt hoe je met Pine aan de slag kan, kan je twee kanten uit: 
ofwel exploreer je het programma verder in je eentje ofwel raadpleeg je de rest van dit 
document voor een beknopt overzicht van de voornaamste Pine-mogelijkheden.
<h4>Pine om hulp vragen</h4>
Om de online hulp te kunnen lezen, maak je gebruik van het help-commando dat onderaan 
elk scherm te vinden is. In het hoofdmenu-scherm bijvoorbeeld tik je <code>?</code>.
Vermits de hulptekst contextgevoelig is, kan je hem nooit volledig 
bekijken. Je hebt dus enkel toegang tot het gedeelte dat slaat op de 
Pine-toepassing die je aan het gebruiken bent. Om de help-functie te verlaten tik 
je <code>e</code> <i>(Exit Help)</i>.
<p>


Om een berichtje te schrijven tik je <code>c</code> <i>(Compose)</i>, vervolgens verschijnt het 
opmaakscherm:
<hr>

<hr>Figuur 2. Een Pine-scherm voor het opmaken van berichten.
<p>
In het bovenstaande commando-menu wordt het ^-teken gebruikt om de controle-toets 
aan te duiden. Dit betekent namelijk dat je de controle-toets (verder in dit document 
aangeduid met <code>[control]</code>) ingedrukt dient te houden bij elke commando-letter 
die ingetikt wordt.
<p>
Druk op <code>[control]g</code> <i>(Get Help)</i> om bijkomende commando's te zien te krijgen. 
Om op het scherm van plaats te veranderen worden de pijltjestoetsen gebruikt of
<code>[control]n</code> <i>(Next line)</i> en <code>[control]p</code> <i>(Previous line)</i>. 
Het uitwissen van misslagen 
gebeurt met <code>[backspace]</code> of <code>[delete]</code>.
<p>
Bij wijze van experiment kan je een boodschap naar jezelf zenden. Dat gaat als volgt:

<h4>Een boodschap schrijven en die naar jezelf zenden</h4>
<p>
Om een bericht te schrijven en het dan vervolgens naar jezelf te zenden:
<ol>
<li>Tik <code>c</code> <i>(Compose)</i>
<li>Schrijf je e-mail-adres in het To:-veld en druk op <code>[enter]</code>
<li>Duw op <code>[enter]</code> in het Cc:-veld

<p>
Stel dat Jean Hughes een account heeft bij de site <code>art.somewhere.edu</code>, dat zijn
gebruikers-ID <code>jhughes</code> is en dat hij zo'n berichtje aan zichzelf schrijft, dan zou het
afgewerkte scherm er als volgt uitzien:

Figuur 3. Pine: een bericht-opmaakscherm.
<p>
<li>Druk op <code>[control]x</code> om je bericht te verzenden
<br>Hierop krijg je de volgende vraag gesteld: <i>Send Message?</i>
<li>Tik <code>y</code> <i>(Yes)</i> of druk op <code>[return]</code>                     
</ol>
<blockquote>De boodschap is nu verzonden en een kopie ervan wordt bewaard 
in de Sent-Mail-map. (Als je <code>n</code> <i>(No)</i> typt, wordt het bericht niet
verzonden en kan je er gewoon aan verder werken).
</blockquote>

<p>
Dit testberichtje is een eenvoudige toepassing. Er zijn uiteraard ook andere 
keuzemogelijkheden bij het opmaken van een bericht. In de volgende sectie wordt op 
enkele van die opties nader ingegaan. De online helpfunctie geeft evenwel een volledig 
overzicht van de opties m.b.t. het bericht-opmaakscherm. Tijdens het samenstellen van 
een bericht kan je op elk moment <code>[control]g</code> <i>(Get help)</i> indrukken. Je krijgt dan 
gedetailleerde informatie over de taak die je aan het uitvoeren bent.
<h4>Tips bij het schrijven van berichten</h4>
<dl>
<dt>To:
<dd>    In dit veld schrijf je de e-mail-adressen van de geadresseerden. De 
adressen
	dienen met komma's van elkaar gescheiden te worden. Na invulling van dit        
	veld op <code>[return]</code> drukken. Opmerking: als je enkel de gebruikers-ID 
	(login-naam) van de geadresseerde intikt, dan gaat Pine er van uit dat het
	rechtergedeelte van het adres in kwestie identiek is aan het rechtergedeelte
	van je eigen adres (vb. art.somewhere.edu) tenzij je dus uitdrukkelijk een
	andere bestemming invult. Controleer steeds de adressen in het To:- en 
	Cc:-veld op correctheid en volledigheid vooraleer de boodschap te verzenden.
<dd>
	<b>Adressen vinden</b>. De beste manier om aan iemands 
	e-mail-adres te komen, is door het zelf aan de betrokkene te vragen. Meer
	informatie over zoeken van e-mail-adressen op lokale en 
	verwijderde computers kom je te weten door <code>[control]g</code> <i>(Get 
	help)</i> in te drukken
	terwijl de cursor zich in het To:-veld bevindt.

<dd>    <b>Het adresboek gebruiken.</b> In het To:- en in het Cc:-veld kan je
	iemands e-mail-adres ofwel manueel inbrengen ofwel het adres importeren
	vanuit het Pine-adresboek-bestand. Meer hierover in het hoofdstuk 
	<a href="#M">Het adresboek gebruiken</A>

<dt>Cc: 
<dd>    In dit veld vul je de adressen in van personen aan wie je een kopie van het
	bericht wenst te zenden. Deze adressen worden met komma's van elkaar    
	gescheiden. Als je hiermee klaar bent, of indien je helemaal geen kopie
	wenst te verzenden, druk je op <code>[return]</code>.

<dt>Attchmnt:

<dd>    Dit is een geavanceerde Pine-mogelijkheid die het mogelijk 
	maakt bestanden aan een 
	bericht te koppelen, inclusief tekstverwerkingsbestanden, spreadsheets, of
	beeldbestanden die opgeslaan zijn in dezelfde computer waar je Pine 
	gebruikt. Meer hierover verneem je door <code>[control]g</code> <i>(Get help)</i> in te             
	drukken terwijl de cursor zich in het Attchmnt:-veld bevindt.

<dt>Subject:
<dd>    In dit gebied geef je met enkele trefwoorden de inhoud van de boodschap
	aan. Bestemmelingen appreci&euml;ren een accurate en beknopte
	inhoudsverwijzing, vermits dit de enige tekstverwijzing is die bij het          
	raadplegen van de Mail-Index te zien is. Ben je hiermee klaar druk dan op
	<code>[return]</code>.

<dt>Message Text:

<dd>    Tik je boodschap in. Gebruik de pijltjestoetsen om in dit gebied te bewegen.
	Voor het verwijderen van tekens gebruik je <code>[backspace]</code> 
	of <code>[delete]</code>.
	Het uitwissen van een regel gebeurt met <code>[control]k</code>, het uitlijnen van de
	tekst met <code>[control]j</code>, een (Engelse) spellingscontrole wordt 
	uitgevoerd met <code>[control]t</code>.

<dd>    Nog andere edit-commando's bekom je met <code>[control]g</code> <i>(Get help)</i>.

<dd>    <b>Een eenvoudig tekstbestand invoegen.</b> Wil je een 'eenvoudig tekstbestand'
	met je bericht meezenden dan kan je zo'n bestand met <code>[control]r</code> <i>(Read    
	in a File)</i> invoegen in de 'body' van het bericht. 'Eenvoudige tekst-files'
	worden gemaakt met editors zoals <code>pico</code> (d.i. de editor die je gebruikt bij
	de samenstelling van een Pine-bericht) of de MS-DOS editor. Wens je meer informatie over het
	invoegen van tekst-files, zet dan je cursor in het Message Text:-veld en 
	druk op <code>[control]g</code> <i>(Get help)</i>.

</dl>
<h4>
Tips bij het verzenden van een bericht</h4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Een bericht verzenden</b>
<dd>    
	Nadat het bericht is opgemaakt, druk je op <code>[control]x</code>, vervolgens tik je
	<code>y</code> en dan duw je op <code>[return]</code>. De boodschap is nu verzonden en een kopie
	ervan wordt bewaard in de Sent-Mail-map. Indien een boodschap om
	een of andere reden niet ter bestemming kan aankomen, wordt ze gewoonlijk
	terug naar de afzender verzonden. Om eenzelfde bericht opnieuw te verzenden
	kan je het <code>f</code> <i>(Forward)</i> commando gebruiken.

<dt><b>Op je stappen terug komen</b>

<P>
De boodschappen die naar jou verzonden worden (inclusief deze die je aan jezelf
adresseert) worden door Pine opgeslagen in je INBOX-map. Deze berichten blijven 
in de INBOX-map aanwezig tot je besluit ze te wissen of ze in andere 
mappen onder 
te brengen. (Over de INBOX-map en andere mappen leer je meer in 
het hoofdstuk <a href="#I">Pine-mappen</A>.)
<p>
De lijst bekijken van de in jouw INBOX-map ontvangen berichten:
<blockquote>
	 Tik <code>i</code> <i>(Folder Index)</i> na het verschijnen van het Pine-Hoofdmenu.
<br>
	Indien je boodschappen ontvangen hebt dan worden deze in een lijst
	ondergebracht. Met het volgende voorbeeld wordt getoond hoe zo'n lijst 
	er uit ziet in het geval van de gebruiker 'jhughes'.

<p>
De geselecteerde boodschap licht automatisch op. De eerste kolom links toont de status 
van het bericht. Deze cel kan blanco zijn of kan 'N' bevatten, wat er op wijst dat  
het bericht nieuw is (ongelezen), als er een '+' staat, is het bericht direct
naar je toe verzonden (het is dan geen kopie van een lijst). Indien er een 'A' staat 
dan betekent dit dat je dit bericht beantwoord hebt (met het 
Reply-commando), staat 
er een 'D' dan heb je het bericht gemarkeerd om het uit te wissen. De overige kolommen
in de berichtregel tonen het berichtnummer, verzendingsdatum, zender, omvang en 
onderwerp. Druk <code>?</code> (Help) voor details.
<p>
Onderaan het scherm zie je een lijst van de meest courante commando's die nodig zijn 
voor de behandeling der berichten. Tik <code>o</code> <i>(Other commands)</i> om alle voorhanden zijnde, 
bijkomende commando's te bekijken. Om ze te kunnen gebruiken hoeven deze commando's 
niet zichtbaar op het scherm te staan. Anders gezegd, <code>o</code> hoeft nooit als een prefix 
van gelijk welk ander commando ingetikt te worden.

<p><hr><a name="I"><b>Pine-mappen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Het aantal berichten dat in je INBOX-map belandt, kan al vlug fiks gaan toenemen.
Stel je voor wat het betekent indien zich daar een honderdtal berichten zou bevinden.
Als je geregeld van e-mail gebruik maakt, kan dit vlugger dan verwacht 
gebeuren. Hoe moet je dan omspringen met de berichtjes die je wil bewaren?
<p>
<b>Berichten ordenen met mappen</b>
<p>Een Pine-map (in het Engels <i>Pine folder</i>) is, net zoals een klasseermap in 
een dossierkast, een opslagplaats voor
berichten. Naarmate je e-mail begint te gebruiken, sla je steeds meer berichten op die 
je dan in verschillende hiervoor aangelegde mappen kan onderbrengen: per onderwerp, 
per datum, per correspondent of volgens een andere categorie die je handig uitkomt.
<p>
Je kan dus zelf je eigen mappen cre&euml;ren en Pine geeft je er alvast 
drie: <blockquote>
	De INBOX-map: hier worden de naar jou verzonden berichten op lijst
	gezet. Nadat je Pine eerst opgestart hebt, ga je naar het Folder-Indexscherm
	om daar de aangekomen berichtjes in de INBOX-map te bekijken. Elk
	bericht blijft in de INBOX-map tot het gewist wordt of naar een andere 
	map verplaatst wordt.
<p>
	De Saved-messages-map: Deze map bevat de kopies van de berichten die je 
	bewaart, tenzij je die kopies in een andere, zelf aangelegde map 
	wenst te bewaren. Zie ook 'Een bericht bewaren'.
<p>
	De Sent-mail-map: Deze map bewaart automatisch de door jou
	verzonden berichten. Dit komt goed van pas om eenzelfde bericht opnieuw 
	te verzenden of wanneer je niet zeker meer bent een bericht al dan niet
	verzonden te hebben.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Mappen onderhouden</b>
<p>
Of je de berichten nu in de INBOX-map bewaart of in je andere Pine-mappen, 
je kan er niet om heen dat ze hoe dan ook plaats innemen en dat je opslagruimte beperkt is.
<ul>
<li>Check geregeld je post om te zien of je nieuwe boodschappen ontvangen 
hebt.

<li>Bewaar niet al te veel berichten in je INBOX-map. Een overbeladen 
INBOX-map zal
trager presteren: bij het opstarten van Pine duurt het dan langer om de uitgebreide 
berichtenlijsten op scherm te zetten. Je hebt dan tevens meer tijd nodig om van het 
ene bericht naar het andere te gaan.

<li>Inkomende berichten die je niet nodig hebt, worden best onmiddellijk verwijderd. 
Heb je ze wel nodig, berg ze dan meteen op in de daartoe bestemde map. 

<li>Maak er een gewoonte van de Pine-mappen geregeld te ontdoen van alle in onbruik 
geraakte berichten.

<li>Pine zal je een maandelijkse boodschap geven met de vraag of je de
volledige Sent-Mail-map van de vorige maanden wil wissen (inclusief alle
berichten die ze bevatten). Dit is een goede manier om plaats te maken.
Indien je deze Sent-Mail-map inderdaad wenst te vernietigen, reageer dan met
<code>y</code>. </ul> 
<p><b>Wisselen van mappen</b><p> 
Wanneer je, na het opstarten van
Pine, in het hoofdmenu <code>i</code> <i>(Index)</i> typt, krijg je een lijst van de berichten
die zich in de INBOX-map bevinden. Wil je de boodschappen bekijken die
zich in een andere map bevinden, dan moet je eerst naar die 
map gaan. De volgende tekst leert je twee manieren om naar een andere map
te gaan en dit vanuit bijna eender welke plaats in Pine.<p>

Toegang krijgen tot je mappen en tot de berichten die erin bewaard worden:
<dl>
<dd>    1. Tik <code>l</code> <i>(Folder List)</i>.

	Er verschijnt dan een scherm met een lijst van mappen (zoals in bijgaande
	figuur) waarin de actieve map oplicht (Bij het opstarten van Pine wordt de 
	INBOX-map geactiveerd).

<hr>
<a name="J"><b>Een bericht bewaren</b></a>
<hr><p>
Bij het bewaren van een bericht word je voor de keuze gesteld: je kan het opslaan in 
de Saved-Messages-map of je kan een andere map aanwijzen.
<p>
Bij het bewaren van een bericht wordt de kopie ervan in de INBOX-map onmiddellijk 
gemarkeerd om gewist te worden zodat je uiteindelijk enkel &eacute;&eacute;n kopie overhoudt.
Bij het verlaten van Pine krijg je de vraag of je al of niet de kopie in 
de INBOX-map
wenst uit te wissen. Om plaats vrij te houden is dit zeker geen slecht idee. 
<p>
<b>Een bericht bewaren in de Saved-Messages-map</b>
<p>
Zo bewaar je een bericht in de Saved-Messages-map: 
<ol>
<li>Gebruik op het Index-scherm de pijltjestoetsen om de boodschap te doen
	oplichten die je wil bewaren (De INBOX-map vertoont twee
	boodschappen) of vertrek van het Message-Text-scherm terwijl je een
	boodschap aan het bekijken bent.
<p>
	Tik <code>s</code> <i>(Save)</i>
<p>
	Men vraagt je vervolgens of je het bericht in de Saved-Messages-map wil
	bewaren of in een andere map.
<p>
	<i>SAVE to folder [saved-messages]:</i>
<p>        
<li>Druk op <code>[return]</code> voor de initi&euml;le map (Saved-Messages)
	Pine bewaart het bericht, en op het scherm verschijnt:
<p>
	<i>[Message "#" copied to folder "saved-messages" and marked deleted]
	</i>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Een bericht bewaren in een zelf gecre&euml;erde map</b>
<p>
Je zal het ongetwijfeld nuttig vinden bijkomende mappen te cre&euml;ren waarin 
je dan berichten over welbepaalde onderwerpen kan stockeren.
<p>
Zo bewaar je een bericht in een door jou gemaakte map:        
<ol>
<li>
	Gebruik op het Index-scherm de pijltjestoetsen om de boodschap te doen
	oplichten die je wil bewaren of vertrek van het Message-Text-scherm terwijl
	je een boodschap aan het bekijken bent.
	<p>
	Tik <code>s</code> <i>(Save)</i> om het bericht te bewaren
<p>
	Men vraagt je vervolgens of je het bericht in de Saved-Messages-map wil
	bewaren of in een andere map.
<p>
	<i>SAVE to folder [saved-messages]:</i><p>
<li>    Tik de naam van een map in en duw op <code>[return]</code>.
	<p>
	Wil je bijvoorbeeld een bericht bewaren in een map met de naam
	'papers', tik dan <code>papers</code> en duw vervolgens op 
        <code>[return]</code> <p>
	Vernoem je deze map voor het eerst dan verschijnt de volgende boodschap
<p>
	<i>Folder "papers" doesn't exist. Create?</i>
<p>                     
	Tik dan <code>y</code> of druk op <code>[return]</code> om de map te maken.
<p>
	Heb je de map al gecre&euml;erd, of tik je de naam van een reeds bestaande
	map, dan verschijnt een boodschap die er aldus uitziet:

<p>     <i>[Message "#" copied to folder "papers" and marked deleted] </i>
</ol>
<p><hr><a name="K"><b>Een bericht doorzenden</b></a>
<hr><p>

Het doorzenden van een op het scherm zichtbaar of een in de Folder-Index geselecteerd
bericht:
<ol>
<li>
	Tik <code>f</code> <i>(Forward)</code>. Een kopie van de boodschap opent zich en het To:-veld licht op

<li>    Vul het adres van de geadresseerde in en verzend het bericht zoals
	     gewoonlijk.
</ol>
<p><hr><a name="L"><b>Een bericht wissen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Pine-mappen worden netjes bijgehouden door ze geregeld te ontdoen 
van overbodig 
geworden berichten. Een bericht uitwissen gebeurt in twee stappen: eerst wordt het
gemarkeerd om gewist te worden en vervolgens wordt het verwijderd.
<p>
Een ongewenst bericht voor verwijdering markeren doe je als volgt:
<ol>
<li>     Selecteer en open de map die het bericht bevat dat je voor verwijdering
	   wenst te markeren. Ben je een Pine-beginneling dan zal dat waarschijnlijk
	   de INBOX-map zijn. Bevindt het bericht dat je voor verwijdering wil
	   markeren zich in een andere map raadpleeg dan hoger de sectie
	   'Wisselen van mappen'.

	<li> Selecteer op het Folder-Index-scherm het bericht dat je voor verwijdering
	   wil markeren, of bekijk gewoon het bericht.

	<li> Tik <code>d</code> <i>(Delete)</i>
<p>
	     Ben je op het Folder-Index-scherm aan het kijken terwijl je een bericht voor
	     verwijdering gemarkeerd hebt, dan zie je in de linkerkolom van de
	     berichtregel een 'D' verschijnen.

<p>     Ben je naar het Message-Text-scherm aan het kijken na een bericht voor
	verwijdering gemarkeerd te hebben dan verschijnt in de rechterbovenhoek
	van het scherm de notatie 'DEL'. Indien er een volgend bericht is, dan
	verschijnt dat op zijn beurt.   
</ol>
<p>
Herhaal dit proces indien je meerdere berichten voor verwijdering wenst te markeren.
<p>             

<b>Een verwijdering ongedaan maken</b>
<p>
Mocht je van gedacht veranderen en de markering voor verwijdering van een bericht
ongedaan willen maken, gebruik dan het <code>u</code>-commando <i>(Undelete)</i>  op eender welk moment 
voor het eigenlijke wissen, het verwijderingsmerkteken te doen verdwijnen.
Is het bericht eenmaal gewist dan kan Pine het onmogelijk nog recupereren.
<p>
<b>Een bericht wissen</b>
<p>
Een voor verwijdering gemarkeerd bericht blijft in Pine tot je het effectief gewist hebt.
Een voor verwijdering gemarkeerd bericht kan op elk moment gewist worden, maar je kan 
ook wachten tot je Pine afsluit. Heb je eenmaal enkele berichten voor verwijdering 
gemarkeerd, dan is het handiger deze meteen te verwijderen, hoe minder berichten een 
map bevat hoe gemakkelijker hij te raadplegen is.
<p>
Om een bericht te wissen ga je als volgt te werk:  
<ol>
<li>    Tik in het Folder-Index-scherm <code>x</code> <i>(Expunge)</i>

	<br>   Je krijgt dan de vraag:
	
	 <br><i>Expunge "#" message(s) from "folder"?</i>
<li>
	 Tik <code>y</code> <i>(Yes)</i> of druk op <code>[return]</code>
<br>
	     hierop verdwijnen de voor verwijdering gemarkeerde berichten.
</ol>

Noteer dat je bij het afsluiten van Pine, of bij het verlaten van een map 
(naast de INBOX-map) die voor verwijdering gemarkeerde berichten bevat, de vraag 
zal krijgen of je de voor verwijdering gemarkeerde berichten effectief wil wissen.
<p><hr><a name="M"><b>Het adresboek gebruiken</b></a>
<hr><p>
Wie met e-mail begint te werken ziet, niet zelden zijn correspondentenbestand toenemen. 
Sommige van die adressen zijn zonder meer even moeilijk in te tikken als te onthouden. 
Met het Pine-adresboek kan je e-mail-adressen stockeren van individuen en 
groepen
en kan je voor deze adressen gemakkelijk te onthouden bijnamen (nicknames) cre&euml;ren.
Bij het opmaken van een bericht kan je dan moeiteloos een adres uit het adresboek 
halen. Hier heb je een voorbeeld van een pagina uit zo'n adresboek.

Figuur 6. Een Pine-adresboek-scherm
<p>

Je kan op twee manieren een individueel adres in je adresboek opnemen. Je kan het 
adres manueel invoeren of het gewoon uit een binnenkomend bericht halen. Met elk
van deze methoden kan je bijnamen gebruiken die naar je correspondenten verwijzen.
Je kan tevens een adressenlijst van een groep in je adresboek plaatsen, maar dat 
kan enkel manueel. 
<p>
<b>Een individueel adres toevoegen</b>
<ol>
<li>     Noteer het adres

<li>     Tik <code>a</code> (adresboek) in het Pine-hoofdmenu

<li>     Tik <code>a</code> <i>(Add)</i>

<li>     Volg de instructies (druk op <code>[control]g</code> als je hulp nodig hebt).
</ol>
<p>
<b>Uit een binnengekomen bericht een individueel adres overnemen</b>
<p>
Om een adres over te nemen uit een binnengekomen of een in de index geselecteerd 
bericht, ga je als volgt te werk:
<ol>

<li>     Tik <code>t</code> <i>(Take Address)</i>. Het <code>T</code>-commando is niet op het scherm zichtbaar
	   tenzij je <code>o</code> <i>(Other Commands)</i> intikt. Hoe dan ook, je hoeft het commando
	   niet te zien om het te kunnen gebruiken.
<li>
	  Volg de instructies (druk op <code>[control]g</code> als je hulp nodig hebt).
</ol>

<b>Een adressenlijst van een groep toevoegen</b>
<p>
Wie geregeld berichten zendt naar een groep, kan een groepslijst van 
adressen cre&euml;ren.
<p>


Om zo'n adressenlijst te cre&euml;ren, ga je als volgt te werk:

<ol>
<li>     Tik <code>a</code> (adresboek) in het Pine-hoofdmenu.

<li>     Tik <code>s</code> (Create List).

<li>     Volg de instructies (druk op <code>[control]g</code> als je hulp nodig hebt).
</ol>
<b>Adressen uit het adresboek halen bij het opmaken van e-mail-berichten</b>
<p>
Bij het samenstellen van een bericht kan je in het To:- of Cc:-veld op de 
volgende wijzen e-mail-adressen invoegen:
<p>
<blockquote>
	Tik het volledige e-mail-adres.
<p>
	Tik een bijnaam die je in het adresboek opgeslaan hebt:
<p>
	Als jouw adresboek er uitzag als dat in Figuur 6 bijvoorbeeld, dan zou je
	de volgende bijnaam in het To:-veld kunnen zetten:

<p>        Mu

<p>     Na op '<code>[return]</code>' gedrukt te hebben zal Pine als volgt het volledige
	adres van Mu uit het adresboek halen: 

<p>      To: Mu Li <muli@u.university.edu>

<p>     Selecteer een naam in het adresboek:


<p>     Plaats de cursor in het To:- of Cc:-veld en druk op <code>control</code>- om 
	naar het adresboek te gaan. Gebruik dan de pijltjestoetsen om de 
	gewenste naam te doen oplichten. Tik dan <code>s</code> <i>(Select)</i> 
	of druk op <code>[return]</code>.

</blockquote>
<p><hr><a name="N"><b>Supplementaire Pine-opties</b></a>
<hr><p>
Pine biedt nog andere opties. Tik hiervoor <code>s</code> <i>
(Setup)</i> in het Pine-hoofdmenu. Je krijgt
dan een boodschap waarin je gevraagd wordt al of niet voor een van de onderstaande 
opties te kiezen:
<p>
Printer: -- Kies een printer voor de Pine-berichten.
<p>
Newpassword: -- Verander je paswoord terwijl je in het Pine-programma bent.
<p>
Config (Setup Configuration): -- Selecteer bijkomende opties.
<p>
Update: -- Voor het opwaarderen van het Pine-programma (inclusief 
technische gegevens en PC-Pine informatie)
<p>

Vooral de optie die het je mogelijk maakt een printer te kiezen, is van belang, reden om er in 
wat volgt nader op in te gaan :
<p>
Het kiezen van printer-variabelen.
<p>
Inzake afdrukken biedt Pine drie mogelijkheden aan. Om de meest geschikte 
optie te kunnen kiezen ga je best te rade bij je lokale PC-verdeler.
<p>
Een printmethode voor Pine vaststellen gebeurt als volgt :
<ol>
<li>
	 Tik <code>s</code> in het Pine-hoofdmenu.

<li>     Tik <code>p</code> (Printer).

<li>     Volg de instructies (druk op <code>[control]g</code> als je hulp nodig hebt).
</ol>
Een boodschap afdrukken:
<p>
Eenmaal de printervariabelen vastgesteld zijn, kan je vanuit het Folder Indexscherm 
of vanuit het View Message-scherm berichten afdrukken door <code>p</code> (Print) te 
tikken. Je zal gevraagd worden je keuze te bevestigen.
<p>
Noteer dat je dit commando ook kan gebruiken om de tekst van Pine's Online Help
te printen.
<p><hr><a name="O"><b>Wat Pine nog meer kan</b></a>
<hr><p>

Pine heeft nog meer nuttige mogelijkheden die in deze inleiding helaas
niet aan bod kunnen komen. Hoewel Pine aanvankelijk ontworpen werd voor de
nieuwkomers in het e-mail-gebeuren, is het gaandeweg toch allerlei
geavanceerde kenmerken gaan vertonen. Het is een gebruiksvriendelijk
programma geworden inzake het zenden, ontvangen en opslaan van Internet
e-mail-boodschappen en Bulletin Board (Netnews) berichten, met inbegrip
van Multimedia attachments. Voor het gebruik met IMAP mailservers is er
tevens een PC-versie van Pine voorhanden. Indien je meer over Pine wenst
te weten te komen: <blockquote>

	Probeer dan alle commando's uit die zich onderaan elk Pine-scherm
	bevinden, inclusief de commando's die verschijnen wanneer je <code>o</code> intikt
	<I>(Other Commands).</i>
<p>
	Raadpleeg geregeld de Pine Online Help. Het komt van pas in elk stadium
	van het Pine-leerproces. Verneem er alles over de verschillende functies, ook
	over deze die je (nog) niet gebruikt.

<p>     Voor meer geavanceerde informatie verwijzen we naar de online Unix-handleiding met zijn verwijzingen naar Pine en Pico. In het Pine Hoofdmenu
	kan je bovendien <code>r</code> kiezen om desbetreffende "release notes" te ontvangen. 
</blockquote>
Het is best mogelijk dat je lokale systeembeheerders Pine afgesteld hebben in functie 
van hun eigen specifieke noden. Het is dan ook niet verwonderlijk dat ze niet altijd 
een volledige configuratie aanbieden van de (alsmaar groeiende) opties; laat staan van
de mogelijkheden inzake gepersonaliseerde edities. Lokale systeembeheerders zijn met 
andere woorden excellente informatiebronnen qua additionele Pine-opties.
<p><hr><a name="P"><b>Richtlijnen bij het gebruik van e-mail</b></a>
<hr><p>

Elektronische post is een uniek communicatiemiddel. Men kan er snel en 
moeiteloos 
berichten mee beantwoorden of doorzenden en e-mail heeft bovendien het voordeel van een 
buitengewoon groot bereik. Deze eigenschappen kunnen evenwel ook tot misbruiken leiden.
Er bestaan enkele basisrichtlijnen voor een verantwoordelijk gebruik van e-mail. 
<p>
Deze richtlijnen stellen je in staat tenvolle van de voordelen van deze technologie 
te genieten terwijl je tegelijk veel gemaakte vergissingen uit de weg kan gaan.
De privacy van een e-mail-boodschap kan niet worden gegarandeerd. Een 
e-mail-bericht kan 
door eender welke geadresseerde doorverzonden, afgedrukt of 
permanent opgeslagen worden. 
E-mail kan bij een verkeerde persoon aankomen, ook al ben je nog zo 
voorzichtig. 
Zet niets in een e-mail-bericht dat je niet door iedereen wil laten lezen. 
Als je 
een niet voor jou bestemde boodschap ontvangt, breng dan de afzender hiervan op de 
hoogte.
<p>
E-mail mist de subtiliteit van de gesproken taal en de lichaamstaal. 
Vermijd pogingen 
tot ironie of sarcasme. Een effici&euml;nt e-mail-bericht is kort, helder en 
relevant.
Vermijd onmiddellijk te reageren op een boodschap die je ergert, en vermijd kost 
wat kost <i>flaming</i>, dat is het zenden van een onbeschoft, brutaal bericht.
<p>
E-mail tips
<p>
Hou bij het gebruik van e-mail de volgende tips voor ogen:
<blockquote>
	E-mail wordt gemakkelijk naar iemand anders doorverzonden. Dit is een 
nuttige
	faciliteit die helaas niet altijd gepast is. In geval van twijfel is het 
	aangewezen bij de afzender te rade te gaan vooraleer een bericht door te zenden.
<p>
	E-mail-antwoorden kunnen meer geadresseerden bereiken dan je denkt.
	Let bij het beantwoorden van een bericht steeds op de lijst van de
	geadresseerden. 

<p>     E-mail kan ook ontaarden in <i>junk-mail</i> (afvalpost); vermijd dus nutteloze 
	verspreidingen van boodschappen.

<p>     De integriteit van een e-mail-bericht kan niet worden gewaarborgd.

<p><hr><a name="Q"><b>Pine sluiten en uitloggen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Pine verlaat je als volgt:
<ol>
<li>Op bijna elke positie in Pine kan je <code>q</code> <i>(Quit)</i> tikken
<br>Je krijgt dan de vraag:
<br><i>Really quit Pine?</i>
<li>Tik <code>y</code> <i>(Yes)</i> of druk op <code>[return]</code> om Pine te verlaten.
</ol>
<p>

Het is een goede gewoonte uit te loggen zodra het werken met Pine 
afgelopen is, of in het geval je de werkzaamheden onverwachts moet staken. Om uit te 
loggen tik je gewoon <code>exit[return]</code> of <code>[control]d</code> 
na de Unix-prompt.

Tin is een <i>full screen</i>, gebruiksvriendelijke nieuwslezer voor 
UNIX-systemen waarin de berichten per onderwerp worden gesorteerd.<p>

Dit document is opgesteld om je te helpen Tin te gebruiken en geeft
je een introductie in enkele fundamentele commando's. Indien
je meer informatie wenst, kan je beknopte (Engelstalige) hulp krijgen 
in Tin zelf door <code>h</code> in te tikken. 
Je kan ook de volledige Engelstalige handleiding oproepen 
door het volgende na de Unix-prompt in te tikken:
<ul>
		<code>man tin[return]</code> 
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<a name="starttin"><b>Tin opstarten</b></a><hr><p>
Om Tin op te starten, tik je na de Unix-prompt:
<ul>
		<code>tin[return]</code>
</ul><p>
Wanneer je Tin voor de eerste maal opstart, ben je automatisch geabonneerd
op alle nieuwsgroepen. Wil je slechts geabonneerd zijn op enkele van die
nieuwsgroepen, doe dan het volgende vooraleer je Tin start: Verwijder 
het bestand <code>.newsrc</code> 
in je hoofddirectory door het volgende na de Unix-prompt in te tikken:
<ul>
		<code>rm .newsrc[return]</code>
</ul>
Wanneer je dan Tin oproept na de Unix-prompt, zal je geen nieuwsgroepen krijgen.
Tik dan <code>y</code> <i>(yank)</i> in om een overzicht van alle groepen 
te krijgen. Je kan dan de lijst doorbladeren. Door het drukken van de
spatiebalk krijg je een nieuw scherm te zien. Met de letters <code>j</code>
en <code>k</code> kan je de nieuwsgroepen een na een doen oplichten. Je kan ook 
naar een onderwerp zoeken dat je interesseert met het zoekcommando
<code>/</code>.<p> 
Om je op een nieuwsgroep te abonneren (dat wil zeggen om automatisch
alle berichten van die groep te krijgen), tik je <code>s</code> 
<i>(subscribe)</i> op het ogenblik dat de naam van die groep opgelicht is.<p>
Ben je klaar met abonneren, tik dan opnieuw <code>y</code> in. De volledige  
lijst van groepen zal verdwijnen en je krijgt dan de lijst te zien
van alleen die groepen waarop je geabonneerd bent.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="selectnewsgroup"><b>Een nieuwsgroep selecteren</b></a>

Als je je op groepen hebt geabonneerd, zoals hierboven beschreven, dan 
krijg je op je scherm een lijst die er zo kan uitzien:

<hr>
Dit is het groepsscherm. We beschrijven nu even de mogelijkheden die
je hier hebt.

<ul>
<li>In het groepsscherm kan je een getal intikken, gevolgd door 
<code>[return]</code>. Stel dat je in het bovenstaande
voorbeeld <code>252[return]</code> indrukt, dan zal de groep <code>unix-pc.general</code>
oplichten. Door hierna <code>[return]</code> te drukken, kan je de
berichten van die nieuwsgroep bekijken.
<li>Met de <code>[tab]</code>-toets ga je naar de
volgende nieuwsgroep die je nog niet gelezen hebt.
<li>Met de <code>/</code>-toets kan je een groep of een bepaald letterpatroon
van een groep in de lijst opzoeken.
<li>Met de <code>c</code>-toets worden alle nieuwsgroepen als gelezen 
beschouwd. Dat kan bijv. handig zijn als je net uit vakantie komt, en
je merkt dat er 14354 berichten zijn die je liever niet alle gaat lezen ...
<li>Met de <code>g</code>-toets kan je je op een nieuwe groep abonneren.
Dat heeft alleen zin als je de preciese naam van de groep kent. Wanneer
dat niet het geval is, gebruik dan de <i>yank</i>-mogelijkheid die
hierboven beschreven is. 
<li>Met de letters <code>j</code> en <code>k</code> kan je een lijn naar
onder, resp. boven gaan.
<li>Met de <code>m</code>-toets <i>(move)</i> kan je de volgorde van de
groepen in het groepsscherm veranderen. Als je daarna bijv. <code>1</code> tikt,
dan komt de groep die oplicht op de eerste plaats. 
<li>Met de <code>q</code>-toets <i>(quit)</i> verlaat je Tin.
<li>Met de <code>s</code>-toets <i>(subscribe)</i> kan je je op een 
groep abonneren (zie hierboven in <a href="#starttin">Tin opstarten</a>).
<li>Met de <code>S</code>-toets (hoofdletter) kan je je op een reeks groepen abonneren
die aan een bepaald patroon voldoen.
<li>Met de <code>u</code>-toets <i>(unsubscribe)</i> kan je je abonnement
op een bepaalde groep opzeggen.
<li>Met de <code>U</code>-toets (hoofdletter) kan je je abonnement
op een reeks groepen opzeggen.
<li>Met de <code>y</code>-toets <i>(yank)</i> kan je alle beschikbare
groepen doen verschijnen of weer doen verdwijnen. Meer hierover in
het hoofdstuk <a href="#starttin">Tin opstarten</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<hr>
<a name="select_and_read"><b>Artikels selecteren en lezen</b></a>

<P>
Wanneer je de nieuwsberichten van een bepaalde groep wilt lezen, dan
zorg je ervoor dat die groep wordt geselecteerd zoals hierboven
beschreven in het hoofdstuk <a href="#selectnewsgroup">Een nieuwsgroep 
selecteren</a>. Een geselecteerde nieuwsgroep licht op. 
Druk dan op <code>[return]</code> om de nieuwsgroep 
te openen. Je krijgt dan een scherm gelijkaardig aan het volgende:

<hr>
<p>De betekenis van verscheidene van deze commando's zagen we reeds in het 
hoofdstuk <a href="#selectnewsgroup">Een nieuwsgroep selecteren</a>. Het
verschil is dat de commando's in dit berichtenscherm geen betrekking hebben op de
nieuwsgroepen, maar op de berichten in de nieuwsgroepen, met andere
woorden, op dat wat je nu op het scherm ziet.<p>
Andere commando's, typisch voor het berichtenscherm, zijn:
<ul>
<li>Het commando <code>[control]k</code>: Dit is een zeer krachtig
commando van Tin. Als je bijvoorbeeld de berichten van een bepaald 
persoon niet meer wenst te lezen, omdat ze niet interessant zijn, dan kan je 
Tin vragen die niet meer te tonen. Anderzijds kan je ervoor zorgen
dat speciaal je aandacht wordt gevestigd (door een asterisk v&oacute;&oacute;r
het bericht op het berichtenscherm) op nieuwsberichten van een bepaalde
persoon, of op nieuwsberichten die in de onderwerpslijn (of in de
onderwerpslijn van antwoorden op een bericht) een bepaald woord 
bevatten. Zorg dat zulk bericht oplicht en tik dan <code>[control]k</code> 
in. Er zal een apart scherm verschijnen dat er ongeveer zo uitziet:

		    Kill / Auto-select Article Menu

Kill type : Kill

Kill text pattern:

Apply pattern to :

Kill Subject [Translation problems                           ] (y/n)

Kill From    [lili@scn.org (Lily Mirovic)                    ] (y/n)

Kill pattern scope: soc.culture.esperanto only
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
Met de spatiebalk kan je nu kiezen tussen <i>Kill</i> (laat bepaalde
berichten niet meer zien) en <i>Auto-select</i> (vestigt speciaal
aandacht op bepaalde berichten). Op de regels daaronder kan je de
selectie nader defini&euml;ren.
<li><code>aA</code>: Met de <code>a</code>-toets kan je in het berichtenscherm nieuwsberichten
van bepaalde auteurs opzoeken. Dat gebeurt vanaf het bericht dat oplicht naar het
einde van de lijst. Met de toets <code>A</code> zoek je vanaf het artikel
dat oplicht naar voren.
<li><code>K</code>: Berichten die je nog niet gelezen hebt, dragen een plusteken. Dat
plusteken kan je doen verdwijnen door de <code>K</code>-toets.
<li><code>l</code>: Vlak voor de titel van een bericht kan nog een cijfer 
voorkomen (zie in het voorbeeldscherm hierboven het bericht <i>hi-tech
road kill</i>. Dat betekent dat op het bericht antwoorden of reacties zijn
binnengekomen. Als je op <code>l</code> drukt, dan zie je een lijst
met die antwoorden. Deze lijst werkt weer als een nieuw berichtenscherm.
D.w.z. dat je ook hier berichten kan doen oplichten en met <code>[return]</code>
lezen.
<li><code>|</code>: Dit commando is enkel geschikt voor gebruikers die met
Unix kunnen werken. Je kan zo een bericht verder zenden en het door een
Unix-commando of door een zelf geschreven programma laten behandelen.  
<li><code>m</code>: Met de <code>m</code>-toets <i>(mail)</i>kan je een artikel via
elektronische post naar een andere gebruiker of naar jezelf zenden.
<li><code>o</code>: Door de <code>o</code>-toets in te drukken wordt
een artikel afgedrukt. Hou er echter rekening mee dat het afdrukken
gebeurt bij de computer waarop Tin draait, in de meeste gevallen dus
op de computer van je provider, en niet op je eigen computer. Als je
je eigen printer wilt gebruiken, dan moet je het artikel eerst opslaan 
(met de instructie <code>s</code>; zie verder) en dan binnenhalen, of via 
de <code>m</code>-toets aan jezelf verzenden.
<li><code>r</code>: Met de <code>r</code>-toets kan je alle gelezen 
artikels als ongelezen bestempelen en omgekeerd.
<li><code>s</code>: Met de <code>s</code>-toets kan je berichten op
schijf opslaan. Hieraan wijden we een apart hoofdstuk in 
<a href="#save">Artikels bewaren</a>
<li><code>t</code>: In plaats van verscheidene artikels of reeksen artikels
apart te moeten verzenden, of apart op schijf op te slaan, kan je ze ook 
aan elkaar koppelen. Met de <code>t</code>-toets <i>(tag)</i> kan je twee 
of meer artikels of reeksen artikels samenbrengen.
<li><code>w</code>: Met de <code>w</code>-instructie kan je zelf artikels
gaan schrijven en posten. Ook hieraan wijden we een apart hoofdstuk in
<a href="#post">Artikels posten</a>.

</pre>
<hr>
<p>De <i>Global Options</i> kan je ook aanpassen met een editor als pico, 
vi of ed in het bestand 
<code>tinrc</code>, dat gelocaliseerd is in je <code>.tin</code>-directory.<p>
<b>Andere verfijningen</b>
<ul>
<li>Een default editor instellen.
Je kan de editor die Tin gebruikt om berichten te posten veranderen
in het bestand <code>tinrc</code> dat in je <code>.tin</code>-directory staat.
Om de default editor van vi naar pico te veranderen, moet de lijn
<code>%E +%N %F</code> vervangen worden door <code>pico +%N %F</code>.

<li>Groepsattributen. 
Je kan het bestand <code>attributes</code> in de <code>.tin</code>-directory 
aanpassen om attributen te zetten voor individu&euml;le nieuwsgroepen. Bijv.,
de volgende regels doen Tin artikels van de groep
<code>comp.binaries.ibm.pc</code> bewaren in directory <code>News/Pc/</code> 
als uudecoded.
<code>
<dl>
<dt>newsgroup=comp.binaries.ibm.pc
<dt>savedir=~/News/Pc
<dt>post_proc_type=2
</dl>
</code>
<p>
</ul>
Andere mogelijkheden kan je vinden door <code>man tin[return]</code>
in te tikken na de Unix-prompt.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="save"><b>Artikels bewaren</b></a>
<hr>
<p>
In Tin kan je artikels bewaren. Er zijn een aantal opties. Begin door 
<code>s</code> <i>(save)</i> in te tikken om een bericht te bewaren.<p>
Je zult het volgende zien onderaan de pagina:
<p><pre>
Save a)rticle, t)hread, h)ot, p)attern, T)agged articles, q)uit: 
</pre><p>
<dl>
	<dd><b>a</b>    Bewaar alleen het artikel
	<dd><b>t</b>    Bewaar ook alle antwoorden op hetzelfde bericht
	<dd><b>h</b>    Bewaar alle artikels die met een asterisk als
			"interessant" zijn gemerkt (zie meer uitleg
			hierboven bij de <code>[control]k</code>-instructie).
	<dd><b>p</b>    Bewaar alle artikels waarvan het onderwerp een bepaald patroon bevat
	<dd><b>T</b>    Bewaar alle artikels die je met elkaar verbonden hebt (zie hierboven 
			meer uitleg bij de <code>t</code>-instructie in het
			hoofdstuk <a href="#select_and_read">Artikels 
			selecteren en lezen</a>)
	<dd><b>q</b>    Stop
</dl>
<p>
Er zal je een bestandsnaam worden gevraagd voor het artikel dat je
wilt bewaren. Hierna zal de volgende lijn verschijnen:
<p><pre>
Process n)one, s)har, u)ud, l)ist zoo, e)xt zoo, L)ist zip, E)xt zip, q)uit:  
</pre><p>
Normaal zal je alleen de optie <i>n)one</i> nodig hebben, d.w.z. sla
dit bericht op schijf op zonder verdere behandeling. 
Sommige (Usenet)-nieuwsgroepen echter, de zgn. <i>binaries</i>, zijn  
nieuwsgroepen die niet hoofdzakelijk uit teksten bestaan, maar uit
binaire bestanden, bijv. uit foto's of geluidsopnamen.
Voorbeelden van dergelijke groepen zijn:
<pre><dl>
	<dd>    alt.binaries.pictures
	<dd>    alt.binaries.sounds
	<dd>    comp.binaries.ibm.pc
</dl></pre>
Heel vaak worden artikels hier in verschillende stukken gepost als 
bestanden gecodeerd met het programma <code>uuencode</code>. Sommige
zijn dan ook nog eens gecomprimeerd tot <code>zip</code>- of <code>
zoo</code>-bestanden. Om zulke 
bestanden te bewaren, moet je met het commando <code>t</code> de
verschillende stukken samenbrengen. De individu&euml;le delen zullen worden 
samengevoegd. Met de andere hierboven vermelde opties kan Tin de informatie 
decoderen en een bruikbaar bestand uit de
gegevens halen. Wanneer dit proces voltooid is, zal Tin je vragen 
of de individu&euml;le delen moeten worden verwijderd. Antwoord 'ja' want deze delen zijn 
nutteloos.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="post"><b>Artikels posten</b></a>
<hr>
<p>
Je kan ook je eigen artikels posten met Tin. Let wel dat een aantal 
groepen 'gemodereerd' zijn, d.w.z. dat een moderator al dan niet je artikel 
kan toelaten, beknotten, enz.
<p>
Er zijn twee manieren om te posten in een nieuwsgroep. Je kan een 
antwoord schrijven op een bestaand artikel. Dat doe je met de instructie
<code>f</code> <i>(follow up)</i>. Jouw artikel zal dan worden toegevoegd 
en een 'draad' vormen (Engels <i>thread</i>) met de vorige. Je kan ook een  
<code>w</code> intikken om een volledig nieuw artikel op te zenden.
Bij het posten zal Tin je naar de 
vi-editor brengen. Zoals
reeds eerder gesteld kan je Tin zo <a href="#customizing">instellen</a>
dat je naar pico gaat in plaats van naar vi.<p>

<p><hr><p>
Lynx is een World Wide Web (WWW) client voor gebruikers die werken
met character-based programma's (en werken met
vt100-terminals, vt100-emulators op PCs of Macs, of andere
"curses-oriented" displays). Lynx toont je hypertext
markup language (HTML) documenten, zowel die met links
naar bestanden die lokaal op het systeem staan, als die op andere
systemen staan, en toegankelijkelijk zijn via
Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS en NNTP-servers. 
(Versies van Lynx zijn beschikbaar voor UNIX en VMS.)<p>


Lynx kan worden gebruikt om informatie op te vragen op het WWW, of
om informatie-systemen op te bouwen enkel voor lokaal gebruik.

<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="1">Lokale bestanden bekijken met Lynx</A></b>
<hr><P>Je kan Lynx opstarten door het Lynx-commando te lanceren samen 
met de naam van het bestand dat je wil bekijken. Deze commando's kan je bv.
gebruiken om een gewoon ASCII-tekstbestand te bekijken.

<dl>
 <dt>UNIX
  <dd><code>lynx myfile</code>
  <dd><code>lynx /home/my-dir/myfile</code>
</dl>

Lynx zal het scherm leegmaken en zoveel mogelijk tekst van het bestand op
het scherm weergeven. Door met de pijltjestoetsen te manoeuvreren kan je
de ganse tekst bekijken. Wanneer je geen bestand specifieert bij aanvang
zal een default bestand worden weergegeven (De KnoopPunt home page). <p>
Lynx zal ook bestanden geschreven in HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
weergeven, wanneer de bestandsnaam eindigt op de tekens ".html". HTML is
een bestandsformaat dat het de gebruikers mogelijk maakt om een bestand te
cre&euml;ren dat hypertext-links bevat naar andere documenten.
Verschillende bestanden aan elkaar gelinkt worden omschreven als een
hypertext-document.<p>

De volgende commando's kunnen worden gebruikt om bestanden te zien die
HTML-hypertext bevatten:

<dl>
  <dt>UNIX
     <dd><code>lynx myfile.html</code>
     <dd><code>lynx /home/my-dir/myfile.html</code>
</dl>

Wanneer Lynx een HTML-bestand toont, worden de links aangegeven, ofwel in
dikke letters en 1 link opgelicht, ofwel zie je een kleurverschil. Het
hangt er een beetje vanaf welk device gedefinieerd is en hoe dat device
geconfigureerd is. Lynx zelf heeft hier geen controle over.  <p>

De link die oplicht is de op dat ogenblik geselecteerde link. Het bestand
dat met die link is geassocieerd, zal worden weergegeven op het ogenblik
dat je <code>[enter]</code> indrukt. Met de pijltjestoetsen kan je op de verschillende
links gaan staan. En wil je dus de bestanden bekijken dan moet je op de
link op <code>[enter]</code> drukken. In het HTML-bestand staat de informatie die lynx
vertelt waar het bestand moet worden gezocht en welke server de informatie
ter beschikking stelt (bv. HTTP, Gopher, etc.). <p>

Wanneer een link verwijst naar een binair bestand zal de gebruikers door
Lynx worden gevraagd of hij of zij dat bestand al dan niet wil
binnenhalen. Wanneer de gebruiker <code>d</code> selecteert voor <I>Download</i>, zal Lynx
het bestand in een tijdelijke locatie plaatsen en de gebruiker een aantal
opties geven. De enige default-optie is <i>save file to disk</i>. Andere
manieren om te downloaden kunnen in het lynx.cfg bestand worden geconfigureerd
door de systeembeheerder. Programma's als Kermit, Z-modem en FTP
zijn mogelijke opties.<br><A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="2">Lynx online help</A></b>
<hr><p>

Hulp is beschikbaar terwijl je een document bekijkt. Tik 
<code>?</code> of <code>H</code> in om een lijst van help topics te zien te krijgen. 
Informatie over het navigeren doorheen de hulpbestanden krijg je in de
sectie getiteld: <A HREF="#6">Navigeren doorheen hypertekst-documenten met Lynx</A> 
<br><A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="3">Lynx verlaten</A></b>
<hr><p>
Lynx verlaat je met het <code>q</code>-commando. Er zal worden gevraagd of je
werkelijk Lynx wilt verlaten. Tik je <code>y</code> in dan zal je Lynx verlaten, tik
je <code>n</code> in dan keer je terug naar het huidige document in Lynx. 
Tik <code>q</code> of <code>[control]d</code> in om zonder verificatie Lynx te verlaten.
<br><A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="4">Lynx opstarten met een <i>Remote File</i></A></b>
<hr><p>
Wil je een bestand bekijken dat op een ander systeem staat dan hetgene 
waar je
Lynx op gebruikt, dan moet je dat bestand opvragen door gebruik te maken van
een <i>Uniform Resource Locator</i> (URL).  URL's nemen deze algemene vorm aan:
<br>
<code>PROTOCOL://HOST/PATH/FILENAME</code>
<br>
<dl>
   <dt><code>PROTOCOL</code>
	<dd>Geeft het communicatie-protocol weer dat het bestand zal 
	voorzien. Lynx kan dus (zoals alle WWW clients) meerdere van die
	protocols aan. 

   <dt><code>HOST</code>
	<dd>Dit is het Internet-adres van het computersysteem waar de server
	op draait.
   
   <dt><code>PATH</code> en <code>FILENAME</code>
	<dd>Geven het pad en de naam van het bestand weer.
</dl>

Hier enkele voorbeelden van URL's:
<dl>
   <dt>HTTP  (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
	<dd><code>http://kuhttp.cc.ukans.edu/lynx_help/lynx_help_main.html</code>
   <dt>Gopher
	<dd><code>gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu/11/</code>
   <dt>FTP  (File Transfer Protocol)
	<dd><code>ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx/README</code>
   <dt>WAIS  (Wide Area Information Service protocol)
	<dd><code>wais://cnidr.org/directory-of-servers</code>
</dl>

Een URL kan aan Lynx worden gegeven bij het opstarten vanop de
commandolijn, bv.:
<dl>
   <dd><code>lynx http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/start_kufacts.html</code>
</dl> 
<br><A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>

<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="6">Navigeren doorheen hypertekst-documenten met Lynx</A></b>
<hr><p>
Het proces waarbij binnen het WWW links geselecteerd en bestanden
weergegeven worden, wordt 'navigeren' genoemd. Bij Lynx kan je dit
bijna allemaal doen door middel van de pijltjestoetsen en het 
cijfertoetsenbord.
<pre>
				       +-------+-------+-------+
				       | TOP   |  /|\  | Page  |
	    pijltjestoetsen            | of    |   |   | UP    |
				       | text 7|   |  8|      9|
	      +---------+              +-------+-------+-------+
	      | SELECT  |              |       |       |       |
	      | prev /|\|              | &lt;---  |       |  ---&gt; |
	      | link  | |              |      4|      5|      6|
    +---------+---------+---------+    +-------+-------+-------+
    |    BACK | SELECT  | DISPLAY |    | END   |   |   | Page  |
    |&lt;-- prev | next  | | sel. --&gt;|    | of    |   |   | DOWN  |
    |    doc. | link \|/| link    |    | text 1|  \|/ 2|      3|
    +---------+---------+---------+    +-------+-------+-------+
</pre>

Ook andere toetsen kunnen worden gebruikt bij het navigeren.
Sommige van deze toetsen hangen af van het feit dat Lynx een lijst van
elk bestand dat je bezoekt, bijhoudt, nl. de <i>history list</i>. Met 
de <code>[backspace]</code>- of <code>[delete]</code>-toets kan je de ganse lijst krijgen. 
Elke van de documenten getoond in deze lijst kan je opnieuw opvragen door
ze te selecteren. Het <code>m</code>-commando brengt je terug naar het document waarmee
je gestart bent.
<p> 

De <code>i</code>-toets toont een index van documenten. De default index is
gewoonlijk een document dat verwijst naar servers over de gehele wereld,
maar de systeembeheerder kan de index veranderen of je kan het zelf op de
commandolijn met de <code>-index</code> switch; het hangt ervan af hoe het
programma geconfigureerd is. 

<p>
Wanneer je op een server aankomt waar je je dient te registreren zal
Lynx je een gebruikersnaam en paswoord vragen. Geef je die correct 
dan zul je de gevraagde informatie krijgen. Lynx stuurt automatisch 
je gebruikersnaam en paswoord door naar de server wanneer hier opnieuw om
verzocht wordt.<br>
<A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="8">Zoekcommando's voor Lynx</A></b>
<hr><p>
Er zijn twee commando's om in Lynx te zoeken, nl.: <code>/</code> en <code>s</code>. 
Terwijl je een gewoon document bekijkt, kan je het
<code>/</code>-commando gebruiken om een woord of een zin binnen het 
document te vinden. Het zoek-type hangt af van de instelling van de
zoek-optie in het options menu (zie verder). De zoek-opties zijn
<i>case sensitive</i> en <i>case insensitive</i>. Sommige documenten zijn
ontworpen om als 'index-documenten' te functioneren. Deze
documenten kunnen worden doorzocht om bijkomende informatie te verkrijgen
via een index server. Het <code>s</code>-commando laat je toe te zoeken in
index-documenten.<br>
<A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="9">Lynx options menu</A></b>
<hr><p>
Het Lynx Options Menu kan je oproepen door een <code>o</code> in te tikken. Het
huidige Lynx Options Menu bevat de volgende opties die je kan configureren.

<pre>
		      Options Menu

     E)ditor                    : emacs
     D)ISPLAY variable          : aixtest.cc.ukans.edu:0.0

</pre>

Je kan een optie veranderen door de hoofdletter van de optie die je wil
veranderen in te tikken (bv. <code>E</code> voor Editor). Moet je een veld invullen
dan kan je dit door gewoon in te tikken vanop je toetsenbord en op <code>[enter]</code> te
drukken. Met de <code>[backspace]</code>- en <code>[delete]</code>-toetsen 
kan je fouten verbeteren, en met <code>[control]u</code> kan je een ganse 
lijn wissen. Wanneer je de gegevens ingegeven
hebt, kan je nogmaals op <code>[enter]</code> drukken om naar de
<code>Command?</code>-prompt terug te keren.<p>

Voor velden waar je moet kiezen uit een lijst van opties, druk je op de
toetsen om de keuzes te maken en hierna op <code>[enter]</code> om de verandering af
te werken.<p>

Wanneer je klaar bent met het veranderen van opties, tik dan een <code>r</code> in om
terug te keren na Lynx, of tik het &gt;-commando in om de opties in een
<code>.lynxrc</code>-bestand te bewaren en terug te keren naar Lynx.<p>

De volgende lijst is een beschrijving van de opties die beschikbaar zijn
in het Options Menu:<p>

<dl>
   <dt>Editor
	<dd>De editor die gebruikt wordt om 'browsable bestanden' te editeren, 
	en bij het versturen van post en commentaren. De volledige padnaam van
	de editor moet worden weergegeven indien mogelijk.

   <dt>DISPLAY variable
	<dd>Deze optie is enkel beschikbaar op UNIX-systemen en is enkel 
	relevant voor X-Window-gebruikers. 

   <dt>Bookmark file
	<dd>Dit is de filename en de lokatie van je persoonlijk bookmark 
	(bladwijzer)bestand. Dat bestand stelt je in staat geregeld 
	bezochte links te bewaren. Met het <code>a</code>-commando (zie 
	verder) kan je gelijk welke link in je bookmark-bestand bewaren. 
	Wanneer het pad niet
	met een schuine streep begint dan zal het pad refereren naar je
	home directory. 

   <dt>FTP sort criteria
	<dd>Deze optie laat je toe om te specifi&euml;ren hoe bestanden gesorteerd 
	worden binnen FTP listings. De huidige opties bevatten o.a.:
	"<i>By Filename</i>" (op bestandsnaam), "<i>By Size</i>" 
	(op grootte),
	"<i>By Type</i>" (op extensie), en "<i>By Date</i>" (op 
	datum).

   <dt>Personal mail address
	<dd>Dit adres zal worden gebruikt om je te helpen om bestanden naar
	jezelf te versturen en zal worden toegevoegd aan het 
	From:-adres in elk bericht dat je verzendt. Het zal ook 
	als het
	From:-veld in alle HTTP get requests vermeld worden.

   <dt>Searching type
	<dd>Hier heb je twee mogelijkheden: <i>case insensitive</i>
	(default) (geen onderscheid tussen grote en kleine letters) en <i>case
	sensitive</i> (wel onderscheid). Het zoek-type betreft enkel
	het zoeken in het document zelf.

   <dt>VI keys
	<dd>Zet je dit op ON dan zullen de h-, j-, k- en l-toetsen 
	respectievelijk als linker-, onder-, boven- en rechterpijl 
	aangeduid worden.
	
   <dt>Emacs keys
	<dd>Zet je dit op ON dan zullen de <code>[control]p</code>-, <code>[control]n</code>-, <code>[control]f</code>- en 
	<code>[control]b</code>-toetsen worden aangeduid als respectievelijk boven-, beneden-, 
	rechter- en linker-pijl.        
	
   <dt>Keypad as arrows or numbered links
	<dd>Deze optie geeft de keuze tussen navigeren met de pijltjestoetsen
	of het aangeven van elke link met een nummer.

   <dt>User Mode
       <dd>Hier heb je drie mogelijkheden: <i>Novice, Intermediate</i> en <I>Advanced</i>.
	 <dl>
	    <dt>Novice
		<dd>In de Novice mode worden twee lijnen met hulp weergegeven
		onderaan het scherm.
	    <dt>Intermediate
		<dd>Hier worden de hulplijnen afgezet.
	    <dt>Advanced
		<dd>Hier wordt de URL van de bezochte link weergegeven onderaan
		het scherm.
	 </dl>

   <dt>Local execution scripts or links
	<dd>Dit kan enkel worden opgegeven door de systeembeheerder. Indien
	dit niet geactiveerd is, zul je dit ook niet te zien krijgen in het
	opties-menu. Wanneer toch een lokaal uitvoerbaar
	script actief is, dan zal Lynx in de opties nagaan of het script 
	uitgevoerd kan worden. Gebruikers hebben dan de volgende mogelijkheden:
	  <dl>
	     <dt>Always off 
		 <dd>Lokale scripts worden nooit uitgevoerd
	     <dt>For Local files only 
		 <dd>Lokale scripts worden enkel uitgevoerd indien het
		 script op de lokale machine staat en er naar gerefereerd 
		 wordt met een URL die begint met "file:///localhost" 
	     <dt>Always on 
		 <dd>Alle lokale scripts worden uitgevoerd
	  </dl>

	<dd> Wanneer de gebruikersopties toelaten dat een script wordt
	uitgevoerd dan zal Lynx een shell openen en het script laten lopen. 
	Wanneer het script niet kan worden uitgevoerd dan zal Lynx het
	script tonen binnen het Lynx-venster en de gebruiker op de hoogte
	brengen dat het script niet kan worden uitgevoerd. Er wordt dan
	gevraagd om de opties na te kijken.<br>
	<A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</a>
</dl>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="10">Commentaren en mailto:-links</A></b>
<hr><p>
Op elk moment terwijl je een document bekijkt in Lynx, kan je met
het <code>c</code>-commando een bericht zenden naar de eigenaar van
het document dat je aan het lezen bent, indien deze aangeduid is als
eigenaar. Indien dit laatste niet het geval is dan is mail uitgesloten. 
Bepaalde links, 'mailto:'-links genaamd, laten je ook toe om post naar
de eigenaar te versturen. 
<p>

Eenmaal je beslist hebt een commentaar te versturen of een 
"mailto:"-link hebt geselecteerd, zal een nieuw scherm verschijnen waar 
getoond wordt naar wie je een bericht verstuurt. Lynx zal je je naam vragen,
je e-mail-adres en een onderwerp voor de mail. Indien je het 
"personal mail address" veld in het options menu hebt ingevuld dan zal
je e-mail-adres automatisch worden ingevuld. Wanneer je bovenstaande
informatie hebt ingevuld, en er staat een editor gedefinieerd in het
options menu, en je bent geen anonieme gebruiker dan zal de gespecifieerde
editor worden klaargezet zodat je je bericht kan intikken. Indien
je geen editor hebt ingesteld of je bent een anonieme gebruiker dan zal 
je het bericht alleen lijn per lijn kunnen intikken.

<b><a name="19">Lynx en HTML-formulieren</a></b>
<hr><p>
Dit punt bespreekt de interface van Lynx voor formulieren. HTML geeft
de makers van documenten de mogelijkheid om online formulieren op te 
stellen die ingevuld kunnen worden wanneer het betreffende document wordt
bekeken. Wanneer een formulier wordt doorgestuurd kan de informatie op
het formulier worden gebruikt om te zoeken in een databank of om een onderzoek
te vervolledigen.
<p>
<b>Mogelijkheden van een HTML-formulier</b>
<dl>
<dt>Buttons:

<dd>Buttons worden op dezelfde manier weergegeven als links in documenten
bij Lynx. Om een button te activeren tik je op de 
rechterpijl of op de <code>[return]</code>-toets.
<p>
<dt>Checkboxes en Radio buttons

<dd>Checkboxes en radio buttons worden met haakje aangeduid:
<tt>( )</tt>. Wanneer een box of een button geselecteerd is, verschijnt
een asterix binnen de haakjes:
<tt>(*)</tt>. Om een box aan te duiden of een button te selecteren tik je
op de rechterpijl of op de <code>[return]</code>-toets.
<p>
<dt>Text Entry Fields

<dd>Plaatsen waar je tekst kan invullen, worden weergegeven door een
rij streepjes, naargelang van de lengte van het veld.: <tt>_______</tt>. 
Je kan de tekst invoeren rechtstreeks vanaf het toetsenbord. Gebruik
de <code>[backspace]</code>-toets om fouten te verbeteren. Indien je meer tekst intikt
dan het veld bepaald heeft, dan zal je input ingekort worden. Wanneer je tekst
intikt zal de cursor niet van het veld afgaan maar blijven hangen op de
laatste positie van het veld.

</dl>
Je kan over het formulier bewegen met de standaard Lynx-navigatie-toetsen.
<b>Pijl naar boven</b> en <b>pijl naar onder</b> 
selecteren resp. het vorige of volgende, veld, box of button. De
<code>[tab]</code>-toetsen selecteren het volgende veld, box of button.
<p>

<b>Opmerking:</b> Wanneer je bezig bent een tekstveld in te vullen, kan je
geen commando vanop het toetsenbord ingeven! 
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="11">Het bekijken van de brontekst van een HTML-bestand en het 
bewerken van bestanden</A></b>
<hr><p>

Wanneer je een HTML-document bekijkt, is het mogelijk het originele
document met de codes te bekijken door een <code>\</code> in te tikken. 
<p>
Wanneer je de
<i>Print to a local file</i> optie vanuit het Print Menu selecteert,
kan je het originele document bewaren, zodat je een kopie hebt van het 
document.
<p>
Belangrijk: wanneer je een HTML-document bewaart, is het belangrijk
het bestand een ".html"-extensie mee te geven, indien je het later met
Lynx wilt bekijken.
<p>
Lynx stelt de gebruikers in staat om documenten te bewerken die op het
lokale systeem staan. Om te bewerken moeten de bestanden als volgt
worden opgeroepen:

<dl>
    <dd><code>lynx file://localhost/FULL/PATH/FILENAME</code>
    <dd><code>lynx path/filename.html</code>
</dl>

Hiernaast moet de gebruiker ook een editor in het opties menu aanduiden
zodat Lynx weet welke editor het moet gebruiken. Wanneer het bestand
correct is aangeduid en een editor gedefinieerd staat, dan kan je
bestanden editeren met het <code>e</code>-commando. Wanneer het <code>e</code>-commando is
ingegeven, wordt de editor gelanceerd zodat je het bestand kan bewerken.
Nadat je de veranderingen hebt doorgevoerd, verlaat je de editor en keer
je terug naar Lynx. Lynx zal dan het bestand heropladen zodat je de
veranderingen kan onderzoeken.<br><A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>
<p><hr>
<b><A NAME="12">Bestanden heropladen</A></b>
<hr><p>
Het <code>[control]r</code>-commando zal het bestand dat je aan het bekijken bent
heropladen. <code>[control]l</code> of <code>[control]w</code> zal het scherm heropfrissen of leegmaken om
fouten die veroorzaakt zijn door het operating system of door andere
omstandigheden te verwijderen of te verbeteren.<br><A HREF="#TOC">Inhoud</A>

<b><A NAME="13">Lynx bookmarks</A></b>
<hr><p>
Het kan nuttig zijn om een bladwijzer <i>(bookmark)</i> te maken die je 
voorziet 
in de mogelijkheid om snel terug te keren naar een document. Om bookmarks
te kunnen gebruiken moet in het options menu een bookmark filenaam aangeduid
staan.
<p>
Tik een <code>a</code> om een link naar een document dat je aan het bekijken bent te 
bewaren als bookmark. Het volgende zal worden gevraagd:
<dl>
	<dd><code>Save D)ocument or L)ink to bookmark 
	file or C)ancel? (d,l,c):</code>
</dl>

Antwoord met <code>d</code> om de link te bewaren van het document dat je aan het 
bekijken bent of een <code>l</code> om de link te bewaren die geselecteerd is in het
betreffende document. Als je <code>c</code> selecteert zal niets worden toegevoegd
aan je bookmark file.
<p>
Door een <code>v</code> in te tikken kan je dat bladwijzerbestand bekijken met de
lijst van bookmarks die je hebt bewaard. Terwijl je die lijst bekijkt 
kan je een bookmark selecteren en het betreffende document opnieuw gaan 
bekijken.<br>

<A NAME="Inleiding"><b>Inleiding</b></A>
<hr><p>
Wie een beetje intensief met Internet werkt, zal ooit wel eens met Unix
in contact komen. Zoals DOS het <i>operating system</i> is waar de meeste
PC's onder draaien, zo is Unix het equivalent voor de "grotere computers".
De meeste computers van Internet-providers, en dus ook die van  
KnoopPunt/Agora, draaien onder Unix.<p>
Wie een <i>shell account</i> heeft, d.w.z. wie eigenlijk werkt op de 
computer van de provider, zij het dan op afstand, die zal het meest met
Unix in contact komen. Maar ook wie een <i>IP account</i> heeft zal met 
dit systeem in aanraking komen wanneer hij gebruikt maakt van Telnet.<p>
Het is niet de bedoeling van deze handleiding om een volledige Unix-cursus
te zijn. Wel wordt er gepoogd om de doorsnee gebruiker van Internet
een beetje wegwijs te maken, zodanig dat hij of zij niet verloren
loopt in een Unix-omgeving en niet gewoon zijn modem moet afzetten bij 
gebrek aan alternatief.
<p><hr>
<A NAME="DOS"><b>Enige verschillen met DOS</b></A>
<hr><p>
Er zijn drie belangrijke verschillen tussen Unix en DOS die beginners
wel eens parten spelen. 
<UL>
<LI>Onderscheid hoofdletters/kleine letters: Onder Unix wordt een verschil
gemaakt tussen kleine letters en hoofdletters. Als je in plaats van de
instructie <code>ls</code> (toon de huidige directory) de letters <code>LS</code>
tikt, dan zul je een vriendelijke mededeling krijgen in de aard van <code>
LS: not found</code>.
<LI>Lange bestandsnamen: Bestandsnamen zijn niet beperkt tot 8 plus 3 letters. Een
geldige bestandsnaam is bijv. <code>Dit_is_mijn_homepage.html</code>.
Bovendien mag er meer dan &eacute;&eacute;n punt in voorkomen.
<LI>UNIX gebruikt een <code>/</code> om directory's te scheiden i.p.v. een
<code>\</code>.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<A NAME="Inloggen"><b>Inloggen</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je op een Unix-computer terecht komt, dan is wellicht het eerste wat
je ziet de mededeling <code>Login:</code>. Hierna tik je je login-naam, gevolgd
door <code>[return]</code>. Daarna wordt je paswoord gevraagd. Ook hierna 
moet je <code>[return]</code> tikken. Na succesvol
ingelogd te zijn, kom je normaal in je <i>home directory</i> terecht. De <i>home
directory</i> is die plaats op de harde schijf die speciaal voor jou gereserveerd
is.<p>
Het eerste wat je ziet in de <i>home directory</i> - en in gelijk welke
directory - is de zgn. Unix-prompt. Deze Unix-prompt kan
verschillende vormen aannemen. Soms bestaat hij alleen uit een $-teken 
of uit een &gt;-teken. Soms bestaat hij bovendien uit het pad, d.w.z.
die plaats van de directory-structuur waar je bent aanbeland. Een prompt
met padaanduiding kan er zo uitzien: <code>/usr/users/jan&gt;</code>.<p>
Een Unix-prompt heeft eigenlijk dezelfde betekenis als een DOS-prompt. Het wil 
zeggen: "Nu is het jouw beurt. Ik verwacht dat je iets gaat intikken". Wat
je moet intikken zijn de Unix-instructies, die we in de volgende
hoofdstukken gaan bekijken.
<p><hr>
<A NAME="ls"><b>Bestandslijsten</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je in een directory bent aanbeland, kan je kijken of daar
bestanden aanwezig zijn. Met de instructie <code>ls [return]</code> krijg
je een overzicht van de bestaande bestanden, bijv.:
<pre>
/usr/users/jan =&gt;ls
brief    ontwerp    public_html/   
/usr/users/jan =&gt;
</pre>
Het kan ook zijn, dat je als antwoord alleen een nieuwe prompt krijgt. In 
dat geval is de directory leeg.<p>
Naast bestanden kan je directory ook andere subdirectory's bevatten.
Soms kan je met de instructie <code>ls</code> het verschil tussen een
bestand en een directory niet zien. De computer van KnoopPunt/Agora is
echter zo geconfigureerd dat je dat wel kan zien. Een directory eindigt
op een /-teken. In het bovenstaande voorbeeld is <code>public_html</code>
dus een directory.<p>
De instructie <code>ls</code> heeft nog een aantal supplementaire argumenten.
Als je <code>ls -l [return]</code> intikt (na het minteken staat een 
letter "el", geen cijfer "een"), dan krijg je een meer uitgebreide 
bestandslijst, bijv. <pre>
/usr/users/jan =&gt;ls -l
-rw-r--r--   1 jan   users         6654 Aug 11 10:50 brief
-rw-r--r--   1 jan   users          324 Aug 24 13:53 ontwerp
drwxrwxrwx   3 jan   users          512 Aug 24 13:53 public_html/
/usr/users/jan =&gt;
</pre>
Laten we even op een rijtje zetten wat we hier zien:
<ul>
<li>Als het eerste teken een d is, dan heb je te maken met een directory.
<li>De volgende negen tekens duiden erop wie toegang heeft tot het betreffende 
bestand of tot de betreffende subdirectory. Hier gaan we echter voorlopig 
niet verder op in.
<li>Het eerste cijfer wijst op de interne structuur van de Unix-nodes. Ook 
dat is een technische zaak waarover we niet verder uitwijden.
<li>Naast het cijfer volgt de naam van de "eigenaar" van het bestand of
van de directory. Dat zal in normale omstandigheden je login-naam zijn.
<li>Naast de login-naam vind je de groep waartoe je behoort. Ook dat heeft
te maken met de toegangsmogelijkheden.  
<li>Het tweede getal dat we ontmoeten, duidt de lengte in bytes aan van 
het bestand. Als het een directory betreft, heeft dit aantal een andere
betekenis.
<li>Wat er nu volgt vraagt waarschijnlijk geen commentaar: de datum en
het uur van de laatste aanpassing en de naam.
</ul><p>
<code>ls</code> heeft nog meer parameters. Met de parameter <code>-t</code>
zie je de bestanden en directory's gerangschikt volgens datum. Met de
parameter <code>-lt</code> verschijnen ze volgens datum en bovendien in
de uitgebreide vorm.<p>
<b>Onzichtbare bestanden</b>: Bestanden die met een punt beginnen,
bijv. <code>.elmrc</code>, zie je normaal niet op je scherm. Je kan ze toch te
voorschijn toveren met de instructie <code>ls -a</code>. 
<p><hr>
<A NAME="Jokers"><b>Jokers en omleggingen</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als er veel bestanden in je directory zitten, kan het al vlug gebeuren
dat de lijst niet op &eacute;&eacute;n scherm kan. De bovenste items kan je
dan niet meer zien. Er zijn verschillende manieren om dat euvel te verhelpen.
<ol>
<li>Jokers: Wellicht wil je niet de gehele directory op je scherm zien,
maar alleen bepaalde bestanden, bijv. de bestanden die op <code>.html</code> 
eindigen. Dat kan je doen door de joker <code>*</code> te gebruiken. De asterisk 
betekent "alles", m.a.w. <code>ls *.html</code> geeft je het gewenste
overzicht van alle bestanden (en directory's) die op <code>.html</code>
eindigen. De asterisk mag waar dan ook staan. <code>ls b*l</code> en 
<code>ls ind*</code> zijn dus ook geldige instructies. <p>
Een tweede joker is het <code>?</code>-teken. Het vraagteken vervangt
slechts &eacute;&eacute;n teken. Zo zal <code>tekst?.txt </code>de bestanden
<code>tekst1.txt </code>en
<code> tekst2.txt</code> tonen maar niet <code>tekst11.txt</code>.<p>
<li>Omleggingen: Normaal gaat het resultaat van ieder Unix-commando naar
het scherm toe. Het resultaat, het antwoord van <code>ls</code>, zie je dus 
op het scherm.
Je kan echter ook dat resultaat omleggen naar ergens anders. Als je de 
instructie <code>ls &gt; lijst</code> geeft, dan zie je op je scherm
niets verschijnen. Het resultaat van de instructie <code>ls</code> - de
<i>output</i> in het Engels - wordt op schijf opgeslagen onder de naam <code>
lijst</code>. Het bestand <code>lijst</code> kan je bijv. met je editor
gaan bewerken.<p>
In plaats van het resultaat weg te schrijven naar een bestand, kan je het
ook verder zenden naar een ander programma. Zulk een ander programma is
<code>more</code> dat als enige functie heeft <i>output</i> scherm per
scherm weer te geven. Verder zenden gebeurt met het teken <code>|</code>.
De instructie <code>ls | more</code> toont dus de directory scherm 
per scherm. Om naar een volgend scherm over te gaan, druk je op de 
spatiebalk.<p>
De instructie <code>more</code> kan ook zelfstandig gebruikt worden. Zo
toont <code>more index.html</code> het bestand <code>index.html</code>
scherm per scherm.
</ol>
<p><hr>
<A NAME="rm"><b>Verwijderen, kopi&euml;ren en hernoemen</b></A>
<hr><p>
<ul>
<li>Verwijderen van bestanden gebeurt met de instructie <code>rm</code>
<i>(remove)</i>. <code>rm brief</code> verwijdert dus het bestand <code>
brief</code>. Let wel: er bestaat geen manier om zulk bestand opnieuw
te voorschijn te toveren! Een veiliger instructie is <code>rm -i</code>. 
Hier wordt het bestand niet onmiddellijk verwijderd. Eerst krijg je de 
vraag of je wel zeker bent ...
<li>Kopi&euml;ren van bestanden doe je met <code>cp</code> <i>(copy)</i>.
Voorbeeld: <code>cp brief brief.oud</code> maakt een copie van het
bestand <code>brief</code> en noemt het <code>brief.oud</code>. Het
oorspronkelijke bestand <code>brief</code> blijft bestaan.
<li>Hernoemen van bestanden kan met <code>mv</code> <i>(move)</i>. 
Voorbeeld: <code>mv brief brief.oud</code> verandert de naam van
bestand <code>brief</code> in <code>brief.oud</code>.<p>
Bij deze drie instructies kan je ook weer jokers gaan gebruiken. <code>rm
tekst*</code> verwijdert dus alle bestanden die met <code>tekst</code>
beginnen.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<A NAME="cd"><b>Directory's</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je inlogt, kom je normaal in je <i>home directory</i> terecht. <b>Om naar een
andere directory te gaan</b>, geef je de instructie <code>cd</code> <I>(change
directory)</i> gevolgd door de naam van de directory, bijv. <code>cd
/usr/users/jan/public_html</code>.<p>
Er zijn echter een aantal methodes om minder letters te moeten intikken.
Als je naar een lagere directory wilt gaan, d.w.z. met een langere
padnaam (bijv. van <code>/usr/users/jan </code>naar <code>/usr/users/jan/public_html
</code>), dan volstaat het om alleen het laatste stukje in te tikken (bijv.
<code>cd public_html</code>). Om weer naar een hogere directory te gaan, 
d.w.z. met een kortere padnaam, kan je <code>cd ..</code> tikken.<p> 
Je kan
ook met sprongen werken. Als je je in <code>/usr/users</code> bevindt
en je wil naar <code>/usr/users/jan/public_html</code> dan tik je <code>
cd jan/public_html</code>. Het omgekeerde (van <code>/usr/users/jan/public_html</code>
naar <code>/usr/users</code>) kan met de instructie <code>cd ../..</code>.
Op die manier kan je alle directory's bereiken (op voorwaarde dat je hier
de toelating voor hebt).<p>
Met <code>cd</code> (zonder argument) ga je meteen naar je <i>home directory</i>, van waar je je
ook bevindt.<p>
Het tilde-teken (~) is een synoniem voor je <i>home directory</i>. In plaats
van <code>cd /usr/users/jan/.tin</code> kan je dus korter <code>cd ~/.tin</code>
tikken, op voorwaarde dat <code>/usr/users/jan</code> je <i>home directory</i>
is. 
(In URL-adressen heeft de tilde een gelijkaardige betekenis. Daar slaat

Een <b>directory cre&euml;ren</b> kan je met de instructie

<b>Onzichtbare directory's</b>: Directory's die met een punt beginnen,
bijv. <code>.tin</code>, zie je normaal niet op je scherm. Je kan ze toch te

<H3>(Beknopte handleiding)</H3>
<hr><p>
Pico is een eenvoudige Unix-editor die prima voldoet om
bijvoorbeeld HTML-bestanden mee te bewerken. Je opent Pico met <code>pico tekst</code>.
Zo openen we het bestand <code>tekst</code> als dat al bestaat, of maken we 
een nieuw bestand aan onder die naam als dat nog niet het geval is. 
Onderaan het scherm staan twee regels met een overzicht van de belangrijkste 
controletoets-combinaties. Door <code>[control]g</code> te tikken wordt een 
helpbestand geopend met de overige mogelijkheden.<BR>
Je kan in Pico je tekst gewoon intikken. Wanneer je aan het einde van een 
regel bent, dan komt het laatste woord automatisch op een nieuwe regel terecht. 
Met de <code>[backspace]</code>-toets kan je een vorig teken wissen en de 
pijltjestoetsen werken normaal. De toetsen <code>[insert], [delete], 
[home], [end], [Page Up]</code> en <code>[Page Down]</code> werken echter 
niet. De belangrijkste Pico-instructies zijn:<PRE>
<b>opdracht                           commando</b>
stoppen                            <code>[control]x</code>            
bewaren                            <code>[control]o</code>
pagina vooruit                     <code>[control]v</code>
pagina terug                       <code>[control]y</code>
begin regel                        <code>[control]a</code>
einde regel                        <code>[control]e</code>
teken verwijderen                  <code>[control]d</code>
regel verwijderen                  <code>[control]k</code>
laatste verwijdering terughalen    <code>[control]u</code>
zoeken                             <code>[control]w</code>

<title>Commando's van de eerste generatie</title>
</head>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/icons/_ZUILTJE.GIF" 
ALT="KnoopPunt/Agora
v.z.w."><h1>Commando's van de eerste 
generatie</h1><hr>

<a name="A"><h3>Telnet</h3></a>
<p>Met Telnet kan je inloggen bij een andere host. Je moet bij die host 
gekend zijn, d.w.z. dat je een toegangsidentificatie en een paswoord nodig hebt.
Voorbeeld:
<code>  <blockquote>telnet access.usask.ca</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Trying 128.233.3.1 ...</blockquote>
<blockquote>Connected to access.usask.ca. Escape character 
is '^]'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ultrix UNIX (access.usask.ca) login: jekawe
		password:</blockquote></code>
<p>Het ingetypte paswoord is niet zichtbaar.<p>
Er bestaan ook programma's onder Windows en op het Mac-platform om een
Telnet-verbinding te leggen.
<a name="B"><h3>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h3></a>
<p>Op Internet vind je massa's files die toegankelijk zijn voor het publiek. 
Vele van die bestanden betreffen gratis of shareware programma's voor zo 
goed als elke computer. Daarnaast kan je ook massa's documenten terugvinden 
op Internet. Dit betreft zowel documenten 
over Internet zelf als documenten betreffende de meest diverse onderwerpen.
Een van de meest gebruikelijke manieren om deze files naar je toe te halen 
is via het File Transfer Protocol. Net als bij Telnet moet je provider wel 
de mogelijkheid bieden om te FTP'en. Is dit niet mogelijk dan is FTP ook 
mogelijk via E-Mail (FTP by mail).
Is FTP voor jou mogelijk dan kan je na de commandoprompt van je host het 
volgende intikken:
<blockquote>    <code>ftp site.name[enter]</code></blockquote>
<p>Er bestaan ook programma's onder Windows en op het Mac-platform om te FTP'en.
<h4>Hoe haal je een file binnen?</h4>
Je tikt eerst het 'adres' in van de plaats (een server die op Internet is 
aangesloten) waar je bestanden wil gaan ophalen en je drukt op <code>[enter] 
</code>. Is de connectie gelukt dan wordt naar je 'login naam' gevraagd. Hier 
tik je <code>anonymous</code> in. Daarna wordt je een paswoord gevraagd. Tik 
daar je e-mail-adres in.
<p>Hierna kan je door het intikken van <code>dir</code> verschillende 
directories bekijken. Een overzicht 
van de beschikbare commando's krijg je door een <code>?</code> in te tikken.
Na het commando <code>dir</code> krijg je een tabel met bestandsbeschijvingen. 
De eerste letter op 
elke lijn vertelt je of je met een file of met een nieuwe directory te maken 
hebt. Begint de lijn met een 'd' of een 'l' dan is het een directory, anders 
is het een bestand.
<p>De meeste FTP-sites hebben een README.POSTING file bovenaan de directory 
waar je informatie in terugvindt over de betreffende site. Om dit bestand
of om andere bestanden die je interesseren binnen te halen, gebruik je het 
commando
	<blockquote><code>get BESTANDSNAAM</code></blockquote>
<p>Meer dan &eacute;&eacute;n bestand tegelijk binnenhalen kan je bijv. met het 
commando
	<blockquote><code>mget *.txt</b></blockquote>
<p>Hiermee haal je alle bestanden binnen met de extensie '.txt'. Vooraleer een
bestand wordt gekopieerd zal je worden gevraagd worden of je het wel wilt.
Ondanks dit laatste kan <code>mget</code> je veel tijd besparen. Als
wil dat het nog sneller gaat en als je alle bestanden werkelijk wilt, tik dan
	<blockquote><code>prompt</code></blockquote>
<p>v&oacute;&oacute;r je het <code>mget</code>-commando intikt. Dit zal de 
prompt uitzetten en alle files zullen in je home directory terechtkomen.
<p>Het commando <code>mget</code> kan je ook een mooie dienst bewijzen bij 
bestanden met een 
verschikkelijk lange naam. In plaats van <code>get Read_this_chapter_first.txt</code>
tik je gewoon <code> mget Read*</code>.
<p>Met het commando
	<blockquote><code>binary</code></blockquote>
<p>vertel je de site en je host dat je een binair bestand binnenhaalt. De 
meeste FTP-sites gebruiken 
het binaire formaat als default, maar een paar zeldzame sites doen dit niet.
<p>Om van directory te veranderen tik je
	<blockquote><code>cd DIRECTORY-NAAM [enter]</code></blockquote>
<p>Met <code>cd windows [enter]</code> bijv. ga je naar de directory "windows".
<p>Om weer naar een hogere directory te gaan tik je
	<blockquote><code>cd ..</code></blockquote>
<p>of
	<blockquote><code>cdup</code></blockquote>
<p>waarna je op <code>[enter]</code> tikt. Weet je van bij aanvang wat je 
wenst, kan je het volgende intikken:
<blockquote><code>get DIRECTORY/SUBDIRECTORY/BESTANDSNAAM</code></blockquote>
<p>Het in deze cursus besproken programma Archie kan je hierbij aardig helpen.
Op vele sites vind je de bestanden bedoeld voor het publiek in de directory 'pub', 
en soms in de directory 'info'. In de directory 'bin' worden meestal de 
programa's geplaatst om de FTP-site te runnen. Ook in 'lost' en 'run' zul je 
niets interessants terugvinden.
Let er ook op dat vele files in een of andere vorm gecomprimeerd zijn. Aan de 
extensie van het bestand kan je zien welke vorm van compressie is toegepast.
<p><b>.txt, .TXT, .doc of .DOC</b> betekent dat de betreffende file eerder 
een document is, dan een programma.
<p><b>.ps of .PS </b>wijst op een PostScript-document (in Adobe's page
description language). 
<p><b>.Z</b> Dit is een Unix-compressie-methode. Om te decomprimeren gebruik 
je het commando <code>uncompress BESTANDSNAAM.Z</code> en tik op <code>[enter] 
</code> op de commandolijn van je host. Je kan de file online lezen, indien 
het een tekstbestand is met het commando: <code>zcat BESTANDSNAAM.txt.Z | more [return]
</code>
<p>Ook belangrijk om in de gaten te houden is de grootte van een bestand. Werk je met een 
'trage' modem, let er dan op dat je geen reusachtige bestanden binnenhaalt. 
Dit kan je telefoonrekening serieus doen oplopen. Sommige bestanden die door 
je host zeer snel worden binnengehaald, kunnen van de host naar jouw computer
uren onderweg zijn als je bijvoorbeeld nog met een 2400 baud modem werkt.
<p>Zonder paniek te willen zaaien, pas ook op voor programma's die virussen 
bevatten. Check altijd eerst het binnengehaalde bestand (zeker als het 
programma's betreft) met een anti-virus programma.
<p>Om het FTP'en gemakkelijker te maken hebben sommige hosts een programma op hun 
systeem staan dat luistert naar de naam NCFTP. Dit slaat enkele FTP-processen 
over en maakt het voor de gebruiker ietwat vriendelijker.
<a name="C"><h3>Archie</h3></a>
<p>Archie is een programma om bestanden op het net te zoeken.
<p><blockquote><code> archie -s BESTANDSNAAM</code></blockquote>
<p>of
<blockquote><code>archie -s BESTANDSNAAM | more</code></blockquote>
<p><code>| more</code> zorgt ervoor dat je het resultaat krijgt  
in verschillende blokken die alle &eacute;&eacute;n scherm groot zijn.
<p>Voorbeeld:
	<blockquote><code>archie -s zterm</code></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>Location: /info-mac/comm</b></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>FILE -rw-r--r--     258256  Feb 15 17:07  zterm-09.hqx</b></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>Location: /info-mac/misc</b></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>FILE -rw-r--r--       7490  Sep 12 1991  ztermsys7-color-icons.hqx</b></blockquote>

v.z.w."><h1>Meer 
gebruiksvriendelijkheid met Gopher </h1><hr>
<p>De commando's van de eerste generatie veronderstelden dat gebruikers zich de strenge 
syntax van de Unix-machines eigen maakten. Gopher maakt het mogelijk om te zoeken op het 
Net met behulp van een menu, dat je kan bedienen met je pijltjestoetsen. 
Na elke keuze die men in het menu maakt, krijgt men een nieuw scherm met 
keuzen. Aan het einde van de weg kan men dan terecht komen in tekstdatabase, 
full text search (Wais), FTP of zelfs Telnet-login.
<p>Er moet nog slechts &eacute;&eacute;n commando worden ingetikt, nl.: 
<code>gopher</code>.

<p>Door<code> q</code> <i>(quit)</i> te selecteren, kan je de Gopher-site 
verlaten. Daarna krijg je de mogelijkheid het geselecteerde document te kopi&euml;ren 
of te e-mailen naar jezelf. Soms kom je in een database terecht, waar je met 
het intikken van trefwoorden onderwerpen kan opsporen. Om weer hogerop 
in het menu te komen tik je <code>u</code> na de menu-prompt (te 
vergelijken met cd .. bij FTP).
<p>Naast FTP-sites zijn er reeds honderden sites die je de mogelijkheid 
bieden om via Gopher op te sporen wat je nodig hebt.
<p>Let ook telkens op hoe elk keuze-onderwerp in een menu eindigt.
Een <code>/</code> duidt aan dat je in een ander menu terecht komt na 
selectie.
<code>?</code> of <code>CSO</code> brengt je bij een database, waar je 
opsporingen kan verrichten.
<p>Een programma dat het je mogelijk maakt om grondige opzoekingen te 
verrichten in 'gopherspace' is 
Veronica, een verwante van Archie voor FTP. Je kan met Veronica werken door 
dit programma te selecteren uit het Gopher-menu van de site waar je terecht 
bent gekomen. 
Meestal moet je de volgende woorden selecteren  "Other gopher and information
services" en daarna  "Searching through
gopherspace using veronica."
<p>Je kan Veronica gebruiken voor praktisch alle soorten onderwerpen. In vele gevallen 
kom je dan terecht bij een Gopher-site naar het onderwerp waar je naar op zoek was. 
Tref je de mogelijkheden om Veronica niet aan bij je host, dan kan je altijd 
terecht bij een Gopher-site die Veronica wel heeft.
<p>Gopher maakt het hiernaast ook mogelijk om <i>bookmarks</i> (bladwijzers)
te maken. Een bladwijzer is een adres van een Gopher-site die je eerder 
hebt bezocht en van plan bent nog opnieuw te bezoeken. Gopher stelt je
dus in staat een lijst van bladwijzers aan te 
leggen, waaruit je op &eacute;&eacute;n van je zoektochten kan selecteren.
<h4>Hoe maak je die <i>Bookmarks</i>?</h4>
<p>Stel je bent op zoektocht binnen een Gopher-site. Op een bepaald ogenblik 
zie je een menu dat je interesseert en dat je graag als <i>Bookmark</i> 
wenst op te slaan. Je tikt op de hoofdletter A, waarna je een naam krijgt 
voor de bladwijzer. Je kan deze naam 
veranderen door de oorspronkelijke naam met <code>[backspace]</code> uit 
te wissen en een nieuwe naam in te tikken. E&eacute;nmaal dit gedaan, 
tik je op <code>[enter]</code>.
<p>Om je bladwijzers te gebruiken, tik je de hoofdletter V in. Hierna krijg 
je de lijst van je 
persoonlijke bladwijzers je kan selecteren, en waarmee je onmiddellijk 
verbonden wordt.
<p>Een interessante combinatie is bijvoorbeeld het cre&euml;ren van een 
bladwijzer waarmee je terecht kan op een site die je de mogelijkheid biedt 
om met Veronica (of Archie) te werken, indien je host deze service niet biedt.
<p>Een bladwijzer kan je verwijderen door in je lijst na het selecteren met 'V' de 
hoofdletter 'D' in te tikken.
<p>In deze korte bespreking hebben we reeds een aantal specifieke 
Gopher-commando's behandeld. Hierna volgt nog een lijst met enkele extra 
commando's en uitleg.
<h4>Gopher commando's</h4>
<b>a</b> Om een lijn toe te voegen van het Gopher-menu
aan je <I>Bookmark</i>-lijst.<br>
<b>A</b> Om een volledig Gopher aan je <i>Bookmark</i>-lijst toe
te voegen.<br>
<b>d</b> Om een bladwijzer te verwijderen.<br>
<b>q</b> Om Gopher te verlaten. Er zal worden gevraagd of
je dit werkelijk wilt.<br>
<b>Q</b> Om een Gopher-site te verlaten zonder dat je nog
eens gevraagd wordt of je dit wilt.<br>
<b>s</b> Om een bestand in je home directory op te slaan.<br>
<b>u</b> Om terug 'hoger' te gaan in een Gopher-structuur.<br>
<b>v</b> Bekijken van je <i>Bookmark list</i><br>
<b>=</b> Om informatie te krijgen over de server waar je
de site aantreft<br>
<b>></b> Vooruit gaan naar een volgend menu<br>
<b><</b> Terugkeren naar een vorig menu<br>
<p>En tenslotte om nog eens kort te herhalen: wil je naar een site waar 
je het adres van kent, tik dan
<blockquote>    <code>gopher SITENAME</code></blockquote>
<p>na de commandoprompt. Ken je geen adressen van een onderwerp waar je zoektocht 
naar uit gaat, gebruik dan Veronica.

<h1>Werken met Eudora</h1>
Eudora is een programma dat zowel onder het Mac- als onder het 
Windows-platform draait, en voorziet in een behoorlijk gebruiksvriendelijke 
interface voor het verzenden en ophalen van elektronische post. Eudora is 
dermate opgezet dat het meest geschikt is voor systemen waar maar &eacute;&eacute;n gebruiker 
op werkt, d.w.z. voor gebruik op computers waar maar &eacute;&eacute;n gebruiker 
geregeld gebruik maakt van de e-mail-mogelijkheid.

<p><hr><a name="A"><b>Postbussen (Mailboxes)</b></a><hr><p>

<center><P><img src="e2.gif" width=324 height=222></center>

<p>Eudora maakt gebruik van een systeem van postbussen
die je zelf kan maken, met als uitzondering drie standaard-postbussen:
<i>in</i> (binnenkomende post), <i>out</i> (uitgaande post) en <i>trash</i> (prullenmand).
Een postbus onder Eudora wordt als een venster weergegeven. Dit venster is
onderverdeeld in een aantal velden of kolommen (zie verder). Van links
naar rechts zijn dit: <i>status, sender/recipient</i> (zender/ontvanger),
<i>date</i> (datum), <i>length</i> (lengte in lijnen) en <i>subject</i> (onderwerp). <p>
Het 'status'-veld toont je of je al dan niet het berichtje reeds gelezen
hebt. Een zwart bolletje duidt ongelezen post aan. Staat er geen bolletje
dan is de post gelezen. Er kunnen in dit veld ook andere tekens
verschijnen waaronder belangrijke zijn: 'F' voor post die je hebt
verdergezonden <i>(forward)</i>, en 'S' wat post aanduidt die door jou is
verzonden (verschijnt als je gekozen hebt om de uitgaande berichten te
bewaren). 

<p><i>Trash</i> is de naam van de prullenmand. Een bericht dat je in de 
prullenmand stopt, kan er nog opnieuw worden uitgehaald. Wanneer je echter 
op <i>Empty trash</i> (maak de prullenmand leeg) klikt, verdwijnt het definitief.

<p><i>In</i> is de brievenbus waar de binnenkomende post geplaatst wordt.  Hier
staat dus de nieuwe post en alle post die je nog niet zelf verplaatst hebt
(d.m.v. <i>transfer</i>). 

<p><i>Out</i> is de brievenbus waar de uitgaande berichten geplaatst worden tot
ze verzonden worden. Kies je ervoor om kopies te maken van die berichten,
dan worden ze hier bewaard. 

<p>Je kan zelf brievenbussen bijmaken naar believen. Het is een goed idee
om brievenbussen te maken voor individuen of organisaties van wie je
geregeld post krijgt. Op die manier kan je de berichten effectief opslaan
en er makkelijker naar op zoek gaan. Gebruik het 'Transfer'-menu om
berichten van de ene brievenbus naar de andere te verhuizen of om ze uit
de prullenmand te halen. 

<p><hr><a name="B"><b>Bijnamen (Nicknames)</b></a><hr><p>

<center><P><img src="e3.gif" width=334 height=222></center>

Een bijnaam wordt ook wel eens een 'alias' genoemd. Een bijnaam of
'nickname' is een woord dat staat voor een e-mail-adres. Laten we eens
veronderstellen dat 'sup' een bijnaam is voor 'support@knooppunt.be'.
I.p.v. van 'support@knooppunt.be' in te tikken, kan je om hem een bericht
te zenden gewoon 'sup' intikken als je gebruik maakt van deze bijnaam. Je
kan ook bijnamen maken die gelden voor verscheidene e-mail-adressen. Dit kan
nuttig zijn wanneer je geregeld dezelfde berichten naar meerdere ontvangers
moet zenden. 
Je kan bijnamen maken door 'nicknames' te selecteren onder het menu
'special'. Hier kan je een persoonlijke collectie bijnamen maken en
eventueel verwijderen en/of aanpassen. 

<p> Het 'Nickname'-menu is tamelijk eenvoudig te gebruiken. De bijnamen
zelf staan in het linkerveld, de geassocieerde adressen in het
rechterveld, en eventuele nota's in het 'Notes'-veld. Met 'Rename'
verander je naam van de geselecteerde bijnaam, met 'Remove' kan je een
bijnaam verwijderen, en tenslotte met 'New' kan je er een toevoegen.
Andere functies maken het mogelijk om een bericht op te zenden
rechtstreeks naar de ontvanger ('To:'), als ontvanger van een kopie
('Cc:', 'Bcc:'). <p>

Om een nieuwe bijnaam toe te voegen moet je een naam intikken (spaties, %,
!, $, enz. zijn niet toegelaten, een mededeling wordt gegeven indien je
een fout maakt), en daarna tik je de e-mail-adressen in. <p>

Een klein trucje is het volgende: bij de optie 'new nickname' kan je 'put
it on the recipient list' selecteren. Op deze manier maak je het jezelf
makkelijker om later berichten te verzenden of verder te zenden. Deze
selectie geeft je de mogelijkheid om een bijnaam snel terug te vinden
onder het 'Message'-menu. <p>

Nieuwe bijnamen kan je snel aanmaken door een of meer berichten te
selecteren en daarna op 'make nickname...' onder het menu 'Special' te
klikken. Eenmaal een naam ingetikt, zal Eudora een bijnaam cre&euml;ren die
verwijst naar de adressen die geassocieerd zijn met de geselecteerde
berichten. 


<p><hr><a name="C"><b>Start:</b></a><hr>
<p>Eudora kan in het hoofdmenu opgestart worden of je kan
Eudora in de start-map van je computer plaatsen. 

<p><hr><a name="D"><b>Post opvragen</b></a><hr>
<p>
Eudora kan geconfigureerd worden om automatisch telkens wanneer een berichtje 
binnenkomt (met een zelf gekozen tijdsinterval) of bij het opstarten te 
controleren of er nieuwe post is. Indien er nieuwe post is dan zal Eudora dit
aangeven.

<P><center><img src="e4.gif" width=322 height=158></center>

<p>
Indien je niet van deze opties gebruik wenst te maken, of indien je niet wil
wachten op het voorbijgaan van de tijdsintervallen dan kan je eventuele nieuwe
post opvragen door in het 'File'-menu 'Check Mail' te selecteren.
<p>
Is er nieuwe post dan zal dit aangegeven worden.
<p><hr>
<a name="E"><b>Post lezen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Wil je een berichtje lezen, dubbelklik dan op het item dat je wilt 
lezen. <p>

<hr><a name="F"><b>Post beantwoorden</b></a>
<hr><p>
Wil je op een berichtje reageren <i>(replying)</i> ga dan naar het 'Message'-menu 
en selecteer 'Reply'. Eudora zal een nieuw bericht cre&euml;ren, geadresseerd aan
de afzender van het origineel, met een kopie van het origineel bijgevoegd, 
klaar om te bewerken.

<p><hr><a name="G"><b>Instellingen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Eudora werkt als volgt:
<p>
Controleren of er nieuwe post is en ontvangen van post:
<p>
1/Eudora legt een verbinding met een centrale mail server en 
kijkt uit naar nieuwe post.<br>  
2/Daarna laadt Eudora ongelezen mail op van deze server, en vernietigt 
(indien Eudora zo is ingesteld) de post op de server.<br>
3/Eudora verbreekt de verbinding met de server.<br>
4/De gebruiker kan zijn mail lezen, vernietigen of bewerken.<br>
<p>
Post verzenden:
<p>
1/Eudora legt een verbinding met een centrale server die post kan 
verzenden.<br>
2/Eudora geeft de uitgaande berichten door aan deze server, bericht
per bericht. Indien nodig zal Eudora berichten coderen, en de resulterende
informatie verzenden.<br>
3/Eudora verbreekt de verbinding met de server.<br>
<p>
POP Server:
<p>
POP (Post Office Protocol) is de methode die Eudora gebruikt om te kijken of 
post klaarstaat bij een mail server. De POP server is het systeem dat je
binnenkomende post klaarzet. Bij KnoopPunt is deze POP server 
naar.knooppunt.be of 192.168.32.254.<p>

POP Account: <p> Een POP account is uw login op de POP server. Elke
account heeft een login-naam en een hiermee geassocieerd paswoord. Een
lokale configuratie van Eudora neemt je login naam op, maar niet je
paswoord. Wanneer een gebruiker kijkt of er post voor hem of haar
klaarstaat, dan zal gevraagd worden naar dit paswoord. Ook indien het toch
mogelijk is, wordt aangeraden - waar privacy gewenst is - om Eudora
zodanig te configureren dat het paswoord niet herinnerd wordt.

<p> SMTP Server: <p> SMTP (Simple Mail Protocol) is de methode die Eudora hanteert
om mail te verzenden. Bij KnoopPunt stel je dit in op naar.knooppunt.be 
of op 192.168.32.254. <p>

Return Address: <p>Dit is het adres dat verschijnt in het 
'Reply-to'-veld in het e-mail-bericht, d.w.z. dit is het adres waarnaar een 
bericht zal worden gezonden wanneer je antwoordt. <p>

<hr><a name="H"><b>Terminologie</b></a><hr>

<p>Folder, map: <p> Dit een verzameling van berichten. Standaardmappen
zijn die met binnenkomende en ontvangen berichten. Indien je ervoor kiest
je uitgaande berichten te bewaren dan zal een 'sent-folder' gemaakt
worden. Dit is ook gekend als <i>mailbox</i>, brievenbus. Synoniemen voor
ontvangen en verzonden zijn <i>in</i> en <i>out</i>. 

<p> List Server: <p> Ook gekend als <i>mailing list, discussion group</i>,
etc. Dit is een groep van individuen verzameld onder een
gemeenschappelijke noemer die post uitwisselen als lid van een groep.
D.w.z. wanneer je post naar die groep verzendt, dan zal ieder lid een
kopie van je bericht ontvangen. Op Internet zijn massa's van die groepen
terug te vinden. 

<p> Host: <p> Dit is de computer die je e-mail-account 'herbergt', in jouw 
geval KnoopPunt. <p>

Domain: <p> 'knooppunt.be' is het domein waaronder de computers van
KnoopPunt vallen.

<p> Address: <p> Een uitdrukking die gebruikt wordt om
af te leiden waar een individu gelokaliseerd is op het Internet (bv.
support@knooppunt.be). Iedereen op het Internet kan berichtjes zenden naar
dit adres en relatief zeker zijn dat dit bericht aankomt.  <p>

Attachment/Enclosure: <p> Een <i>attachment</i> of <i>enclosure</i> is een bestand
dat meegezonden wordt met een e-mail-bericht. Hoewel essentieel deel
uitmakend van dit bericht, wordt het aangeduid als verschillend van de
rest van het bericht om achteraf z'n 'extractie' te vergemakkelijken.
<p><i>Attachments/enclosures</i> bieden de mogelijkheid om zaken te verzenden
via e-mail die geen blokken tekst zijn. E-mail dat in essentie een
text-only medium is, is niet direct geschikt om bv. tekeningen te
verzenden. Via <i>attachments</i> kan je bestanden gecodeerd verzenden om dit
probleem te omzeilen. De formaten hiervoor gebruikt, worden gewoonlijk
bijgevoegd bovenaan de <i>attachment</i>, en geven de gebruiker en de e-mail
client (Eudora is zo'n e-mail client) de gegevens voor de extractie van de
gecodeerde bestand. De meest gekende formaten zijn Binhex, uuencoding en
Mime. Eudora zal automatisch <i>attachments</i> decoderen die het als binhex of
mime ontvangt, en plaatst hierna de bestanden in de 'System folder' 
(systeemmap) van Eudora.
<i>Enclosures</i> verschillen van <i>attachments</i> in die mate dat de informatie in
het bericht zelf geplaatst wordt. <p>

<hr><a name="I"><b>Acties</b></a>
<hr><p>Mail: <p> Om een bericht te verzenden naar iemand moet je zijn of haar
e-mail-adres kennen. Eventueel zijn er verscheidene ontvangers van een
bericht, afgescheiden met een komma.

<p>Reply: <p> Als iemand je een bericht zendt, kan je hierop
reageren. Het mailprogramma zal automatisch het adres gebruiken dat bij
het origineel bericht zat.

<p>Forward: <p> Als iemand je een bericht gezonden heeft en je wil een
kopie van dit bericht doorzenden naar iemand anders dan kan je het bericht
'forwarden'. Hiervoor heb je wel het e-mail-adres nodig van de persoon
naar wie je het bericht wilt zenden. 

<p><hr><a name="J"><b>Benamingen</b></a>
<hr><p>Domain Name:
<p>
bv. knooppunt.be<br>
Duidt de organisatie aan die een aantal computers beheert. Deze machines 
beheren de e-mail-adressen van de gebruikers van deze organisatie, en bieden
een aantal diensten aan zoals WWW, FTP, Gopher, etc.
Met de twee letters op het einde van de domein naam wordt meestal het
land aangeduid waar het systeem gevestigd is. 'be' bv. staat voor Belgi&euml;.
Bestaan de laatste letters op het einde van de naam uit drie letters dan 
worden gebruikelijk systemen aangeduid die gevestigd zijn in de Verenigde
Staten. 'Com' bv. duidt een commercieel systeem in de VS aan, 'edu' een
educatieve instelling en 'gov' een overheidsinstelling.
Sommige landen hanteren benamen als bv. 'gov.au' (overheidsinstelling
in Australi&euml;)...
<p>
Host Name:
<p>
machinenaam.domein.naam
bv. naar.knooppunt.be.
Dit duidt een machine aan die gevestigd is aan een bepaald domein. 'naar' is
de machinenaam; 'knooppunt.be' is de domeinnaam.
<p>
E-mail-adres:
<p>
Dit is het adres waarnaar je schrijft als je een individu of een organisatie
wilt bereiken.

<li><A NAME="Inleiding"><b>Inleiding</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je je eigen <i>home page</i> op het Wereldwijde Web (WWW) wil hebben, of 
zelfs een hele <i>web site</i> (een structuur van verschillende 
WWW-bladzijden), dan heb je in principe twee mogelijkheden. Ofwel laat je het
werk aan een specialist over, ofwel probeer je zelf je infobladzijden in 
elkaar te knutselen. In het eerste geval wend je je best tot 
<a href="mailto:support@knooppunt.be">KnoopPunt Support</A> (support@knooppunt.be).
Wat het gaat
kosten kan je in de <a 
href="http:/ned/info/prijzen/index.html">KnoopPunt-prijslijst</A>
vinden.<br>
Als je echter zelf je infobladzijden wil samenstellen, dan zijn de  
volgende alinea's dat wat je nodig hebt.
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="html"><b>HTML leren</b></A>
<hr><p>
De eerste stap is het leren van HTML. HTML is de afkorting van <i>Hypertext
Markup Language</i> en het is de computertaal waarin alle WWW-pagina's
zijn geschreven. HTML leren kan je op drie manieren:
<ul>
<LI>Je kan een boekhandel binnenstappen en een handboek kopen. Een goed
boek is <i>Het HTML-boek. Leidraad voor het maken van grafische,
interactieve World Wide Web-pagina's</i> van Larry Aronson,  
uitgegeven bij A.W.Bruna Informatica (ISBN 90-229-3881-6).
<LI>Als volleerd surfer kan je natuurlijk via de 
<a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/roadmap/help.html">zoekrobots</a> zelf HTML-handleidingen gaan 
opsporen. We helpen je echter een handje: kijk eerst eens naar 
<a href="http://huizen.dds.nl/~florisb/handl.html">de handleiding van
Floris Bos</a>.
<LI>De derde en wellicht de beste oplossing is dat je even cursus gaat
volgen bij de KnoopPunt Webmaster. Zo'n cursus duurt in principe van 10 tot
15 uur en heeft meestal plaats op zaterdag. Het is een praktijkcursus
zodat je je eigen HTML-werkjes onmiddellijk via Netscape of een andere
browser kan bekijken. Meer info vind je op de
<a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/info/training/index.html">cursusbladzijde</A>
van KnoopPunt. De datum van de volgende cursus krijg je van
<a href="mailto:support@knooppunt.be">KnoopPunt Support</A>
(support@knooppunt.be).
</ul>
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="tekst"><b>Tekstverwerkers</b></A>
<hr><p>
Wanneer je denkt HTML onder de knie te hebben, dan kan je je eerste bladzijde
gaan schrijven. Er bestaan op de markt een hele reeks speciale tekstverwerkers
voor HTML, maar als je er zo geen hebt, dan gaat het even goed met een 
eenvoudige "platte-tekstverwerker". Voorbeelden hiervan zijn <b>Edit</b> 
onder
DOS, <b>Kladblok</b> onder Windows en <b>Leertekst</b> op het Mac-platform.
Als je uitsluitend een volledige tekstverwerker hebt - d.w.z. een tekstverwerker waarmee
je ook cursief, vet e.d. kunt afdrukken - dan kan die ook dienen op voorwaarde dat
je al die snufjes niet gebruikt (Een woord maak je vet door HTML-instructies
toe te voegen, en niet door op de knop "vet" in je tekstverwerker te klikken.) Bovendien
moet je in zulke tekstverwerker je HTML-bestanden opslaan als "platte
ASCII-tekst". In het programma <b>Write</b> bijv. noemt men dat "opslaan als  
tekstbestand", in <b>MS Word</b> "bestand opslaan als alleen tekst". 
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="naam"><b>Naamgeving</b></A>
<hr><p>
De naam waaronder je je HTML-bestand opslaat is belangrijk. Er zijn twee
aspecten:
<ul><li>De extensie: Een HTML-bestand op de KnoopPunt-server (en op vrijwel alle
andere servers) moet op .html eindigen. Geldige HTML-bestandsnamen zijn bijv.
index.html, les-1.html, dit_is_mijn_goudvis.html. Als je op een Mac werkt of
onder Windows95, dan geef je je bestanden dus best meteen een naam die op .html eindigt. 
Als dat niet kan (onder DOS of Windows 3.1 bijv.) dan geef je de bestanden de 
extensie .htm. 
<li>De <i>home page</i>: Als je slechts &eacute;&eacute;n HTML-bestand op de
server plaatst, dan moet dat bestand de naam <code>index.html</code>
hebben. Als je er
meer hebt, dan is <code>index.html</code> het bestand van waaruit links naar al je
andere bestanden vertrekken. <code>Index.html</code> is dus de 
<i>home page</i> of hoofdpagina
die leidt naar alle andere nevenpagina's.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="test"><b>Je HTML-pagina testen</b></A>
<hr><p>
Wanneer je HTML-bestand klaar is en op schijf opgeslagen, dan ga je het best
eerst met een browser bekijken vooraleer je het op de KnoopPunt-server
plaatst. De manier waarop dat gebeurt hangt af van het systeem dat je
gebruikt:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Op het Mac-platform</b> is alles het eenvoudigst. Je zet je modem 
af, dubbelklikt op het Netscape-icoontje en je wacht tot Netscape is opgestart. 
Ga nu naar het menu <i>File</i> en klik op <i>Open file ...</i>. Je
selecteert het HTML-bestand dat je hebt gemaakt en je nieuwe <i>home page</i>
verschijnt (hopelijk) in al zijn glorie!
<p><li><b>Onder Windows 3.1 of 3.11</b> zet je de modem aan. Daarna  
open je
het venster van het programma Trumpet Winsock, zonder evenwel 
<i>Dialler</i> aan te klikken. Daarna verklein je het Trumpet-venster of ga je met
<code>[control][esc]</code> opnieuw naar het KnoopPunt-venster. Daar dubbelklik 
je op Netscape. Nu kan je via het menu <i>File</i> en via <i>Open file 
...</i> je HTML-bestand bekijken.
</ul>
<p><b>Een gulden tip:</b> Als je meer dan &eacute;&eacute;n browser hebt, bijv. Netscape 1 en 2 en 3,
of Mosaic, bekijk dan je HTML-bestand met al die programma's. Het gebeurt
dat een klein programmeringsfoutje (bijv. het vergeten van een sluit-aanhalingsteken)
dat door &eacute;&eacute;n browser niet wordt opgemerkt, in een andere leidt tot
het verliezen van een stuk tekst.<p>
<b>Tip 2:</b> Als je nog veranderingen aanbrengt aan je HTML-bestand
terwijl je "in Netscape zit", dan moet je na iedere verandering op
de <i>Reload</i>-knop klikken.
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="server"><b>Naar de server!</b></A>
<hr><p>
Het grote moment is er dan. Je <i>home page</i> is geschreven en uitgetest.  
Nu moet je ze alleen nog op de KnoopPunt-server plaatsen opdat de wereld ze
zou kunnen bekijken.
<ul>
<li>Leg een verbinding op de gewone manier (Trumpet Winsock,
Config PPP, enz.).
<li>Start daarna onder Windows het programma WS-FTP, onder 
Mac het programma Fetch. De eerste maal dat je die programma's start, wordt
gevraagd je e-mail-adres op te geven.
<li>Tik nu na <i>Host</i> de woorden <code>ftp.knooppunt.be</code> of
de getallen <code>192.168.32.254</code>, na <i>Userid</i> je 
gebruikersnaam en na <i>Password</i> je paswoord.
<li>Klik nu op <i>Connect</i>.
Je krijgt nu in WS-FTP een venster met links een overzicht van de
bestanden op je eigen computer, rechts een overzicht van de
bestanden in je home directory bij KnoopPunt. In Fetch zie je alleen
een venster met de bestanden op de KnoopPunt-server.
<li>Als het de eerste keer is
dat je HTML-bestanden op de server plaatst, dan is het noodzakelijk een
aparte directory te maken speciaal voor die bestanden. Die
directory moet <code>public_html</code> heten (tussen de twee woorden 
staat het lage streepje, in het Engels <i>underscore</i>). Maak de
directory door te klikken op <i>New directory</i> (In Fetch op het Mac-platform
moet je klikken op het menu <i>Directories</i> en dan op <i>Create
new directory</i>).
<li>Ga daarna naar die nieuwe 
directory ofwel door erop te dubbelklikken, ofwel door &eacute;&eacute;n
maal te klikken
en dan te klikken op <i>Change directory</i> (In Fetch onder het menu
<i>Directories</i>).
<li>Je kunt nu in WS-FTP met de 
pijltjesknoppen (de pijltjesknoppen op je scherm, niet de pijltjestoetsen
op je toetsenbord) het HTML-bestand dat je hebt gemaakt overzetten naar
je nieuwe directory <code>public_html</code>. In Fetch doe je hetzelfde
maar met de knop <i>Put</i>.
</ul>
<p>
Als je onder Windows 3.1 of 3.11 werkt moet je bovendien nu nog de extensie
.htm veranderen in .html. Dat kan je doen door op <i>Change name</i> te
klikken.
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="adres"><b>De adressen of URL's van je pagina's</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als dat alles gebeurd is, kan je je pagina bekijken vanop iedere 
Internet-browser ter wereld. Je kan vanaf nu bijv. op je briefpapier het 
adres of URL van je <i>home page</i> vermelden (URL is de afkorting
van Uniform Resource Locator, 
uniforme bronverwijzing, en je <i>home page</i> is die HTML-bladzijde
die je "index.html" hebt genoemd).
<br>De URL van je <i>home page</i> is 
<code>http://www.knooppunt.be/~LOGINNAAM</code> waarin je 
<code>LOGINNAAM</code> natuurlijk moet vervangen door je echte loginnaam 
bij KnoopPunt.
<br>Als je in je directory <code>public_html</code> nog andere 
bestanden hebt gezet, dan hebben die als URL 
<code>http://www.knooppunt.be/~LOGINNAAM/BESTANDSNAAM</code>.
<br>In je directory <code>public_html</code> kan je indien gewenst nog 
subdirectory's maken met daarin andere HTML-pagina's of bijv.
grafische afbeeldingen. Als je dat hebt 
gedaan, dan is de URL van die bestanden 
<code>http://www.knooppunt.be/~LOGINNAAM/SUBDIRECTORY/BESTANDSNAAM</code>. 
<P><hr>
<li><A NAME="lieven"><b>Een seintje aan de Webmaster</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als allerlaatste stap geef je aan de <a href="mailto:webmaster@knooppunt.be">Webmaster
van KnoopPunt</a> (webmaster@knooppunt.be)
een seintje dat je de trotse bezitter van een nieuwe <i>home page</i>
bent. Hij zal dan nog even controleren of alles in orde is.

<a name="abouttin"> <h2> About Tin </h2> </a>
Tin is a full screen, easy to use, threaded (sorted by subject) News reader for the UNIX systems.<p>

This document will get you started using tin and will introduce you to some of the basic commands of tin.  If you need more information you can get extended help in tin by typing <b>h</b> while in tin, or view the on-line manual by typing the following at

 the uhunix prompt:<ul>
		<b>man tin</b> 
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<a name="starttin"> <h2>Starting Tin</h2> </a>
To start tin, at the unix prompt type:
<ul>
		<b>tin</b>
</ul><p>
When you first start tin, you will be subscribed to all the newsgroups.  If you wish to rather be subscribed only to a few selected newsgroups, do the following.  Delete the <i> .newsrc </i> file in your root directory by typing the following at the unix 

propmt:
<ul>
<li> <b>rm .newsrc </b>
</ul>
When you invoke tin at the unix prompt, you will have no newsgroups.  Type <b> y </b> to 'yank' out all newsgroups.  Then search for a topic you would be interested in with the <b> / </b> command.  Then type <b> s </b> to subscribe to that one newsgroup. 

 After finishing, type <b> y </b> again to condense the list to the groups that you are only subscribe to. 
<p>
The Following is the TIN newsgroup list that appears on your screen.
Notice that the bottom of the screen shows some options available.

<hr><hr>
<p>The Global Options can also be modified through the <b> tinrc </b> file located in your <b> .tin </b> directory.
<h3>Other Useful Customizations</h3>
<h4>Setting a Default Editor</h4>
You can change the default editor Tin uses for posting by editting your <b> tinrc </b> file which is located in your <b> .tin </b> directory.
To change the default editor from vi to pico, replace the line <b> %E +%N %F </b> to <b> pico +%N %F </b>.
<h4>Group Attributes</h4>
Modify the <b> attributes </b> file found in the <b> .tin </b> directory to set attributes for individual newsgroups.  For example, adding the following lines will tell Tin to save articles from comp.binaries.ibm.pc in News/Pc/ as uudecoded.
<dl>
<dt>newsgroup=comp.binaries.ibm.pc
<dt>savedir=~/News/Pc
<dt>post_proc_type=2
</dl>
<p>
More detailed customizing instructions are available by typing <b> man tin </b> at the unix prompt.  <p>
<p>
<a name="save"><h2> Saving articles</h2></a>
You can save articles posted on the Usenet with Tin.  Tin allows you to have many options when saving.  Begin by typing <b> s </b> to save.<p>
You will see the following prompt at the bottom of the page:<p><pre>
Save a)rticle, t)hread, h)ot, p)attern, T)agged articles, q)uit: 
</pre><p>
<pre>
<dl>
	<dd><b>a</b>	Save a single article
	<dd><b>t</b>	Save a thread of articles  (responses under a single subject heading.)
	<dd><b>h</b>	Save hot articles
	<dd><b>p</b>	Save all articles with the same subject pattern
	<dd><b>T</b>	Save articles which had been Tagged
	<dd><b>q</b>	Cancel the saving process
</dl>
</pre><p>
You will then be prompted for a filename to save the article(s) as.  Then, the following line will appear:<p><pre>
Process n)one, s)har, u)ud, l)ist zoo, e)xt zoo, L)ist zip, E)xt zip, q)uit:  
</pre><p>

<pre><dl>
	<dd><b>n</b>	none (normal text)
	<dd><b>s</b>	unpacking of multi-part shell archives
	<dd><b>u</b>	unpacking of multi-part uuencoded files
	<dd><b>l</b>	unpacking of multi-part uuencoded files, which  produce a *.zoo archive whose contents are listed
	<dd><b>e</b>	unpacking of multi-part uuencoded files, which  produce a *.zoo archive whose contents are extracted
	<dd><b>L</b>	unpacking of multi-part uuencoded files, which  produce a *.zip archive whose contents are listed
	<dd><b>E</b>	unpacking of multi-part uuencoded files, which  produce a *.zip archive whose contents are extracted
	<dd><b>q</b>	Cancel saving process
</dl>
</pre><p>
<h3>Saving Binary Files</h3><p>
The USENET offers a category of newsgroups called <b> binaries </b>.  Examples of these groups are:
<pre><dl>
	<dd>	Alt.binaries.pictures
	<dd>	Alt.binaries.sounds
	<dd>	Comp.binaries.ibm.pc
</dl></pre>
Often times the files are posted as multi-part uuencoded files.  To save the actual file, you must first <b> t</b>ag each article associated with the file.  Then save the <b> T</b>agged articles and save it as a <b> u</b>udecoded file.  The indiviual part

s will be merged and Tin will automatically decode the information and extract the usable file.  When <i> post processing </i> is completed, Tin will ask you if you would like to delete the individual parts that have been processed.  Answer yes, because t

hese parts are useless.
<p>
<a name="post"><h2>Posting articles</h2></a>
You can post your own articles to most of the USENET newsgroups using Tin.  There are a few <i> moderated </i> newsgroup which restrict rampant posting. <p>
There are two ways of posting to a newsgroup.  You can <b> f</b>ollowup to an existing article, where your post will be added to the <i> thread </i>, or you can type <b> w </b> to post an article with a new subject heading.<p>
When posting, Tin will take you to the <b> vi </b> text editor where you will type up your article.  You can <a href="#customizing">customize</a> Tin so that posting will take you to <b> pico </b> instead of <b> vi </b>.<p>

<A NAME="Inleiding"><b>Inleiding</b></A>
<hr><p>
Wie een beetje intensief met Internet werkt, zal ooit wel eens met Unix
in contact komen. Zoals DOS het <i>operating system</i> is waar de meeste
PC's onder draaien, zo is Unix het equivalent voor de "grotere computers".
De meeste computers van Internet-providers, en dus ook die van  
KnoopPunt/Agora, draaien onder Unix.<p>
Wie een <i>shell account</i> heeft, d.w.z. wie eigenlijk werkt op de 
computer van de provider, zij het dan op afstand, die zal het meest met
Unix in contact komen. Maar ook wie een <i>IP account</i> heeft zal met 
dit systeem in aanraking komen wanneer hij gebruikt maakt van Telnet.<p>
Het is niet de bedoeling van deze handleiding om een volledige Unix-cursus
te zijn. Wel wordt er gepoogd om de doorsnee gebruiker van Internet
een beetje wegwijs te maken, zodanig dat hij of zij niet verloren
loopt in een Unix-omgeving en niet gewoon zijn modem moet afzetten bij 
gebrek aan alternatief.
<p><hr>
<A NAME="DOS"><b>Enige verschillen met DOS</b></A>
<hr><p>
Er zijn drie belangrijke verschillen tussen Unix en DOS die beginners
wel eens parten spelen. 
<UL>
<LI>Onderscheid hoofdletters/kleine letters: Onder Unix wordt een verschil
gemaakt tussen kleine letters en hoofdletters. Als je in plaats van de
instructie <code>ls</code> (toon de huidige directory) de letters <code>LS</code>
tikt, dan zul je een vriendelijke mededeling krijgen in de aard van <code>
LS: not found</code>.
<LI>Lange bestandsnamen: Bestandsnamen zijn niet beperkt tot 8 plus 3 letters. Een
geldige bestandsnaam is bijv. <code>Dit_is_mijn_homepage.html</code>.
Bovendien mag er meer dan &eacute;&eacute;n punt in voorkomen.
<LI>UNIX gebruikt een <code>/</code> om directory's te scheiden i.p.v. een
<code>\</code>.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<A NAME="Inloggen"><b>Inloggen</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je op een Unix-computer terecht komt, dan is wellicht het eerste wat
je ziet de mededeling <code>Login:</code>. Hierna tik je je login-naam, gevolgd
door <code>[return]</code>. Daarna wordt je paswoord gevraagd. Ook hierna 
moet je <code>[return]</code> tikken. Na succesvol
ingelogd te zijn, kom je normaal in je <i>home directory</i> terecht. De <i>home
directory</i> is die plaats op de harde schijf die speciaal voor jou gereserveerd
is.<p>
Het eerste wat je ziet in de <i>home directory</i> - en in gelijk welke
directory - is de zgn. Unix-prompt. Deze Unix-prompt kan
verschillende vormen aannemen. Soms bestaat hij alleen uit een $-teken 
of uit een &gt;-teken. Soms bestaat hij bovendien uit het pad, d.w.z.
die plaats van de directory-structuur waar je bent aanbeland. Een prompt
met padaanduiding kan er zo uitzien: <code>/usr/users/jan&gt;</code>.<p>
Een Unix-prompt heeft eigenlijk dezelfde betekenis als een DOS-prompt. Het wil 
zeggen: "Nu is het jouw beurt. Ik verwacht dat je iets gaat intikken". Wat
je moet intikken zijn de Unix-instructies, die we in de volgende
hoofdstukken gaan bekijken.
<p><hr>
<A NAME="ls"><b>Bestandslijsten</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je in een directory bent aanbeland, kan je kijken of daar
bestanden aanwezig zijn. Met de instructie <code>ls [return]</code> krijg
je een overzicht van de bestaande bestanden, bijv.:
<pre>
/usr/users/jan =&gt;ls
brief    ontwerp    public_html/   
/usr/users/jan =&gt;
</pre>
Het kan ook zijn, dat je als antwoord alleen een nieuwe prompt krijgt. In 
dat geval is de directory leeg.<p>
Naast bestanden kan je directory ook andere subdirectory's bevatten.
Soms kan je met de instructie <code>ls</code> het verschil tussen een
bestand en een directory niet zien. De computer van KnoopPunt/Agora is
echter zo geconfigureerd dat je dat wel kan zien. Een directory eindigt
op een /-teken. In het bovenstaande voorbeeld is <code>public_html</code>
dus een directory.<p>
De instructie <code>ls</code> heeft nog een aantal supplementaire argumenten.
Als je <code>ls -l [return]</code> intikt (na het minteken staat een 
letter "el", geen cijfer "een"), dan krijg je een meer uitgebreide 
bestandslijst, bijv. <pre>
/usr/users/jan =&gt;ls -l
-rw-r--r--   1 jan   users         6654 Aug 11 10:50 brief
-rw-r--r--   1 jan   users          324 Aug 24 13:53 ontwerp
drwxrwxrwx   3 jan   users          512 Aug 24 13:53 public_html/
/usr/users/jan =&gt;
</pre>
Laten we even op een rijtje zetten wat we hier zien:
<ul>
<li>Als het eerste teken een d is, dan heb je te maken met een directory.
<li>De volgende negen tekens duiden erop wie toegang heeft tot het betreffende 
bestand of tot de betreffende subdirectory. Hier gaan we echter voorlopig 
niet verder op in.
<li>Het eerste cijfer wijst op de interne structuur van de Unix-nodes. Ook 
dat is een technische zaak waarover we niet verder uitwijden.
<li>Naast het cijfer volgt de naam van de "eigenaar" van het bestand of
van de directory. Dat zal in normale omstandigheden je login-naam zijn.
<li>Naast de login-naam vind je de groep waartoe je behoort. Ook dat heeft
te maken met de toegangsmogelijkheden.  
<li>Het tweede getal dat we ontmoeten, duidt de lengte in bytes aan van 
het bestand. Als het een directory betreft, heeft dit aantal een andere
betekenis.
<li>Wat er nu volgt vraagt waarschijnlijk geen commentaar: de datum en
het uur van de laatste aanpassing en de naam.
</ul><p>
<code>ls</code> heeft nog meer parameters. Met de parameter <code>-t</code>
zie je de bestanden en directory's gerangschikt volgens datum. Met de
parameter <code>-lt</code> verschijnen ze volgens datum en bovendien in
de uitgebreide vorm.<p>
<b>Onzichtbare bestanden</b>: Bestanden die met een punt beginnen,
bijv. <code>.elmrc</code>, zie je normaal niet op je scherm. Je kan ze toch te
voorschijn toveren met de instructie <code>ls -a</code>. 
<p><hr>
<A NAME="Jokers"><b>Jokers en omleggingen</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als er veel bestanden in je directory zitten, kan het al vlug gebeuren
dat de lijst niet op &eacute;&eacute;n scherm kan. De bovenste items kan je
dan niet meer zien. Er zijn verschillende manieren om dat euvel te verhelpen.
<ol>
<li>Jokers: Wellicht wil je niet de gehele directory op je scherm zien,
maar alleen bepaalde bestanden, bijv. de bestanden die op <code>.html</code> 
eindigen. Dat kan je doen door de joker <code>*</code> te gebruiken. De asterisk 
betekent "alles", m.a.w. <code>ls *.html</code> geeft je het gewenste
overzicht van alle bestanden (en directory's) die op <code>.html</code>
eindigen. De asterisk mag waar dan ook staan. <code>ls b*l</code> en 
<code>ls ind*</code> zijn dus ook geldige instructies. <p>
Een tweede joker is het <code>?</code>-teken. Het vraagteken vervangt
slechts &eacute;&eacute;n teken. Zo zal <code>tekst?.txt </code>de bestanden
<code>tekst1.txt </code>en
<code> tekst2.txt</code> tonen maar niet <code>tekst11.txt</code>.<p>
<li>Omleggingen: Normaal gaat het resultaat van ieder Unix-commando naar
het scherm toe. Het resultaat, het antwoord van <code>ls</code>, zie je dus 
op het scherm.
Je kan echter ook dat resultaat omleggen naar ergens anders. Als je de 
instructie <code>ls &gt; lijst</code> geeft, dan zie je op je scherm
niets verschijnen. Het resultaat van de instructie <code>ls</code> - de
<i>output</i> in het Engels - wordt op schijf opgeslagen onder de naam <code>
lijst</code>. Het bestand <code>lijst</code> kan je bijv. met je editor
gaan bewerken.<p>
In plaats van het resultaat weg te schrijven naar een bestand, kan je het
ook verder zenden naar een ander programma. Zulk een ander programma is
<code>more</code> dat als enige functie heeft <i>output</i> scherm per
scherm weer te geven. Verder zenden gebeurt met het teken <code>|</code>.
De instructie <code>ls | more</code> toont dus de directory scherm 
per scherm. Om naar een volgend scherm over te gaan, druk je op de 
spatiebalk.<p>
De instructie <code>more</code> kan ook zelfstandig gebruikt worden. Zo
toont <code>more index.html</code> het bestand <code>index.html</code>
scherm per scherm.
</ol>
<p><hr>
<A NAME="rm"><b>Verwijderen, kopi&euml;ren en hernoemen</b></A>
<hr><p>
<ul>
<li>Verwijderen van bestanden gebeurt met de instructie <code>rm</code>
<i>(remove)</i>. <code>rm brief</code> verwijdert dus het bestand <code>
brief</code>. Let wel: er bestaat geen manier om zulk bestand opnieuw
te voorschijn te toveren! Een veiliger instructie is <code>rm -i</code>. 
Hier wordt het bestand niet onmiddellijk verwijderd. Eerst krijg je de 
vraag of je wel zeker bent ...
<li>Kopi&euml;ren van bestanden doe je met <code>cp</code> <i>(copy)</i>.
Voorbeeld: <code>cp brief brief.oud</code> maakt een copie van het
bestand <code>brief</code> en noemt het <code>brief.oud</code>. Het
oorspronkelijke bestand <code>brief</code> blijft bestaan.
<li>Hernoemen van bestanden kan met <code>mv</code> <i>(move)</i>. 
Voorbeeld: <code>mv brief brief.oud</code> verandert de naam van
bestand <code>brief</code> in <code>brief.oud</code>.<p>
Bij deze drie instructies kan je ook weer jokers gaan gebruiken. <code>rm
tekst*</code> verwijdert dus alle bestanden die met <code>tekst</code>
beginnen.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<A NAME="cd"><b>Directory's</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als je inlogt, kom je normaal in je <i>home directory</i> terecht. <b>Om naar een
andere directory te gaan</b>, geef je de instructie <code>cd</code> <I>(change
directory)</i> gevolgd door de naam van de directory, bijv. <code>cd
/usr/users/jan/public_html</code>.<p>
Er zijn echter een aantal methodes om minder letters te moeten intikken.
Als je naar een lagere directory wilt gaan, d.w.z. met een langere
padnaam (bijv. van <code>/usr/users/jan </code>naar <code>/usr/users/jan/public_html
</code>), dan volstaat het om alleen het laatste stukje in te tikken (bijv.
<code>cd public_html</code>). Om weer naar een hogere directory te gaan, 
d.w.z. met een kortere padnaam, kan je <code>cd ..</code> tikken.<p> 
Je kan
ook met sprongen werken. Als je je in <code>/usr/users</code> bevindt
en je wil naar <code>/usr/users/jan/public_html</code> dan tik je <code>
cd jan/public_html</code>. Het omgekeerde (van <code>/usr/users/jan/public_html</code>
naar <code>/usr/users</code>) kan met de instructie <code>cd ../..</code>.
Op die manier kan je alle directory's bereiken (op voorwaarde dat je hier
de toelating voor hebt).<p>
Met <code>cd</code> (zonder argument) ga je meteen naar je <i>home directory</i>, van waar je je
ook bevindt.<p>
Het tilde-teken (~) is een synoniem voor je <i>home directory</i>. In plaats
van <code>cd /usr/users/jan/.tin</code> kan je dus korter <code>cd ~/.tin</code>
tikken, op voorwaarde dat <code>/usr/users/jan</code> je <i>home directory</i>
is. 
(In URL-adressen heeft de tilde een gelijkaardige betekenis. Daar slaat
ze echter niet op de <i>home directory</i> maar op de directory waar het bestand
<code>index.html</code> te vinden is. Bij KnoopPunt/Agora is dat de directory
<code>/usr/users/LOGIN-NAAM/public_html</code>)<p>
Een <b>directory cre&euml;ren</b> kan je met de instructie 
<code>mkdir</code>
gevolgd door de naam van de directory die je wil maken. Een <b>directory
verwijderen</b> gebeurt met <code>rm -R</code>, bijv. <code>rm -R 
public_html</code>.<p>
<b>Verplaatsen van bestanden</b> van de ene directory naar de andere kan ook
met de instructie <code>mv</code>. Bijv. <code>mv index.html public_html
</code> verplaatst het bestand <code>index.html</code> naar de
directory <code>public_html</code>.<p>
<b>Onzichtbare directory's</b>: Directory's die met een punt beginnen,
bijv. <code>.tin</code>, zie je normaal niet op je scherm. Je kan ze toch te
voorschijn toveren met de instructie <code>ls -a</code>. Naar een
onzichtbare directory kan je gewoon met <code>cd</code>, bijv. <code>
cd .tin</code>.
<p><hr>
<A NAME="aliaj"><b>Andere mogelijkheden</b></A>
<hr><p>
<ol>
<li>Paswoord: Een van de dingen die je in de Unix-shell kan doen, is
je paswoord veranderen. Dit doe je gewoon door de instructie <code>
passwd</code> in te tikken. Unix zal je eerst naar je oude paswoord
vragen, en daarna kan je het nieuwe ingeven.
<li>Andere toepassingsprogramma's: Na de Unix-prompt kan je een hele

<H3>(Beknopte handleiding)</H3>
<hr><p>
Pico is een eenvoudige Unix-editor die prima voldoet om
bijvoorbeeld HTML-bestanden mee te bewerken. Je opent Pico met <code>pico tekst</code>.
Zo openen we het bestand <code>tekst</code> als dat al bestaat, of maken we 
een nieuw bestand aan onder die naam als dat nog niet het geval is. 
Onderaan het scherm staan twee regels met een overzicht van de belangrijkste 
controletoets-combinaties. Door <code>[control]g</code> te tikken wordt een 
helpbestand geopend met de overige mogelijkheden.<BR>
Je kan in Pico je tekst gewoon intikken. Wanneer je aan het einde van een 
regel bent, dan komt het laatste woord automatisch op een nieuwe regel terecht. 
Met de <code>[backspace]</code>-toets kan je een vorig teken wissen en de 
pijltjestoetsen werken normaal. De toetsen <code>[insert], [delete], 
[home], [end], [Page Up]</code> en <code>[Page Down]</code> werken echter 
niet. De belangrijkste Pico-instructies zijn:<PRE>
<b>opdracht                           commando</b>
stoppen                            <code>[control]x</code>            
bewaren                            <code>[control]o</code>
pagina vooruit                     <code>[control]v</code>
pagina terug                       <code>[control]y</code>
begin regel                        <code>[control]a</code>
einde regel                        <code>[control]e</code>
teken verwijderen                  <code>[control]d</code>
regel verwijderen                  <code>[control]k</code>
laatste verwijdering terughalen    <code>[control]u</code>
zoeken                             <code>[control]w</code>

<title>Commando's van de eerste generatie</title>
</head>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="/icons/_ZUILTJE.GIF" 
ALT="KnoopPunt/Agora
v.z.w."><h1>Commando's van de eerste 
generatie</h1><hr>

<a name="A"><h3>Telnet</h3></a>
<p>Met Telnet kan je inloggen bij een andere host. Je moet bij die host 
gekend zijn, d.w.z. dat je een toegangsidentificatie en een paswoord nodig hebt.
Voorbeeld:
<code>  <blockquote>telnet access.usask.ca</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Trying 128.233.3.1 ...</blockquote>
<blockquote>Connected to access.usask.ca. Escape character 
is '^]'.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ultrix UNIX (access.usask.ca) login: jekawe
		password:</blockquote></code>
<p>Het ingetypte paswoord is niet zichtbaar.<p>
Er bestaan ook programma's onder Windows en op het Mac-platform om een
Telnet-verbinding te leggen.
<a name="B"><h3>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h3></a>
<p>Op Internet vind je massa's files die toegankelijk zijn voor het publiek. 
Vele van die bestanden betreffen gratis of shareware programma's voor zo 
goed als elke computer. Daarnaast kan je ook massa's documenten terugvinden 
op Internet. Dit betreft zowel documenten 
over Internet zelf als documenten betreffende de meest diverse onderwerpen.
Een van de meest gebruikelijke manieren om deze files naar je toe te halen 
is via het File Transfer Protocol. Net als bij Telnet moet je provider wel 
de mogelijkheid bieden om te FTP'en. Is dit niet mogelijk dan is FTP ook 
mogelijk via E-Mail (FTP by mail).
Is FTP voor jou mogelijk dan kan je na de commandoprompt van je host het 
volgende intikken:
<blockquote>    <code>ftp site.name[enter]</code></blockquote>
<p>Er bestaan ook programma's onder Windows en op het Mac-platform om te FTP'en.
<h4>Hoe haal je een file binnen?</h4>
Je tikt eerst het 'adres' in van de plaats (een server die op Internet is 
aangesloten) waar je bestanden wil gaan ophalen en je drukt op <code>[enter] 
</code>. Is de connectie gelukt dan wordt naar je 'login naam' gevraagd. Hier 
tik je <code>anonymous</code> in. Daarna wordt je een paswoord gevraagd. Tik 
daar je e-mail-adres in.
<p>Hierna kan je door het intikken van <code>dir</code> verschillende 
directories bekijken. Een overzicht 
van de beschikbare commando's krijg je door een <code>?</code> in te tikken.
Na het commando <code>dir</code> krijg je een tabel met bestandsbeschijvingen. 
De eerste letter op 
elke lijn vertelt je of je met een file of met een nieuwe directory te maken 
hebt. Begint de lijn met een 'd' of een 'l' dan is het een directory, anders 
is het een bestand.
<p>De meeste FTP-sites hebben een README.POSTING file bovenaan de directory 
waar je informatie in terugvindt over de betreffende site. Om dit bestand
of om andere bestanden die je interesseren binnen te halen, gebruik je het 
commando
	<blockquote><code>get BESTANDSNAAM</code></blockquote>
<p>Meer dan &eacute;&eacute;n bestand tegelijk binnenhalen kan je bijv. met het 
commando
	<blockquote><code>mget *.txt</b></blockquote>
<p>Hiermee haal je alle bestanden binnen met de extensie '.txt'. Vooraleer een
bestand wordt gekopieerd zal je worden gevraagd worden of je het wel wilt.
Ondanks dit laatste kan <code>mget</code> je veel tijd besparen. Als
wil dat het nog sneller gaat en als je alle bestanden werkelijk wilt, tik dan
	<blockquote><code>prompt</code></blockquote>
<p>v&oacute;&oacute;r je het <code>mget</code>-commando intikt. Dit zal de 
prompt uitzetten en alle files zullen in je home directory terechtkomen.
<p>Het commando <code>mget</code> kan je ook een mooie dienst bewijzen bij 
bestanden met een 
verschikkelijk lange naam. In plaats van <code>get Read_this_chapter_first.txt</code>
tik je gewoon <code> mget Read*</code>.
<p>Met het commando
	<blockquote><code>binary</code></blockquote>
<p>vertel je de site en je host dat je een binair bestand binnenhaalt. De 
meeste FTP-sites gebruiken 
het binaire formaat als default, maar een paar zeldzame sites doen dit niet.
<p>Om van directory te veranderen tik je
	<blockquote><code>cd DIRECTORY-NAAM [enter]</code></blockquote>
<p>Met <code>cd windows [enter]</code> bijv. ga je naar de directory "windows".
<p>Om weer naar een hogere directory te gaan tik je
	<blockquote><code>cd ..</code></blockquote>
<p>of
	<blockquote><code>cdup</code></blockquote>
<p>waarna je op <code>[enter]</code> tikt. Weet je van bij aanvang wat je 
wenst, kan je het volgende intikken:
<blockquote><code>get DIRECTORY/SUBDIRECTORY/BESTANDSNAAM</code></blockquote>
<p>Het in deze cursus besproken programma Archie kan je hierbij aardig helpen.
Op vele sites vind je de bestanden bedoeld voor het publiek in de directory 'pub', 
en soms in de directory 'info'. In de directory 'bin' worden meestal de 
programa's geplaatst om de FTP-site te runnen. Ook in 'lost' en 'run' zul je 
niets interessants terugvinden.
Let er ook op dat vele files in een of andere vorm gecomprimeerd zijn. Aan de 
extensie van het bestand kan je zien welke vorm van compressie is toegepast.
<p><b>.txt, .TXT, .doc of .DOC</b> betekent dat de betreffende file eerder 
een document is, dan een programma.
<p><b>.ps of .PS </b>wijst op een PostScript-document (in Adobe's page
description language). 
<p><b>.Z</b> Dit is een Unix-compressie-methode. Om te decomprimeren gebruik 
je het commando <code>uncompress BESTANDSNAAM.Z</code> en tik op <code>[enter] 
</code> op de commandolijn van je host. Je kan de file online lezen, indien 
het een tekstbestand is met het commando: <code>zcat BESTANDSNAAM.txt.Z | more [return]
</code>
<p>Ook belangrijk om in de gaten te houden is de grootte van een bestand. Werk je met een 
'trage' modem, let er dan op dat je geen reusachtige bestanden binnenhaalt. 
Dit kan je telefoonrekening serieus doen oplopen. Sommige bestanden die door 
je host zeer snel worden binnengehaald, kunnen van de host naar jouw computer
uren onderweg zijn als je bijvoorbeeld nog met een 2400 baud modem werkt.
<p>Zonder paniek te willen zaaien, pas ook op voor programma's die virussen 
bevatten. Check altijd eerst het binnengehaalde bestand (zeker als het 
programma's betreft) met een anti-virus programma.
<p>Om het FTP'en gemakkelijker te maken hebben sommige hosts een programma op hun 
systeem staan dat luistert naar de naam NCFTP. Dit slaat enkele FTP-processen 
over en maakt het voor de gebruiker ietwat vriendelijker.
<a name="C"><h3>Archie</h3></a>
<p>Archie is een programma om bestanden op het net te zoeken.
<p><blockquote><code> archie -s BESTANDSNAAM</code></blockquote>
<p>of
<blockquote><code>archie -s BESTANDSNAAM | more</code></blockquote>
<p><code>| more</code> zorgt ervoor dat je het resultaat krijgt  
in verschillende blokken die alle &eacute;&eacute;n scherm groot zijn.
<p>Voorbeeld:
	<blockquote><code>archie -s zterm</code></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>Location: /info-mac/comm</b></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>FILE -rw-r--r--     258256  Feb 15 17:07  zterm-09.hqx</b></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>Location: /info-mac/misc</b></blockquote>
	<blockquote><b>FILE -rw-r--r--       7490  Sep 12 1991  ztermsys7-color-icons.hqx</b></blockquote>

gebruiksvriendelijkheid met Gopher </h1><hr>
<p>De commando's van de eerste generatie veronderstelden dat gebruikers zich de strenge 
syntax van de Unix-machines eigen maakten. Gopher maakt het mogelijk om te zoeken op het 
Net met behulp van een menu, dat je kan bedienen met je pijltjestoetsen. 
Na elke keuze die men in het menu maakt, krijgt men een nieuw scherm met 
keuzen. Aan het einde van de weg kan men dan terecht komen in tekstdatabase, 
full text search (Wais), FTP of zelfs Telnet-login.
<p>Er moet nog slechts &eacute;&eacute;n commando worden ingetikt, nl.: 
<code>gopher</code>.

<p>Door<code> q</code> <i>(quit)</i> te selecteren, kan je de Gopher-site 
verlaten. Daarna krijg je de mogelijkheid het geselecteerde document te kopi&euml;ren 
of te e-mailen naar jezelf. Soms kom je in een database terecht, waar je met 
het intikken van trefwoorden onderwerpen kan opsporen. Om weer hogerop 
in het menu te komen tik je <code>u</code> na de menu-prompt (te 
vergelijken met cd .. bij FTP).
<p>Naast FTP-sites zijn er reeds honderden sites die je de mogelijkheid 
bieden om via Gopher op te sporen wat je nodig hebt.
<p>Let ook telkens op hoe elk keuze-onderwerp in een menu eindigt.
Een <code>/</code> duidt aan dat je in een ander menu terecht komt na 
selectie.
<code>?</code> of <code>CSO</code> brengt je bij een database, waar je 
opsporingen kan verrichten.
<p>Een programma dat het je mogelijk maakt om grondige opzoekingen te 
verrichten in 'gopherspace' is 
Veronica, een verwante van Archie voor FTP. Je kan met Veronica werken door 
dit programma te selecteren uit het Gopher-menu van de site waar je terecht 
bent gekomen. 
Meestal moet je de volgende woorden selecteren  "Other gopher and information
services" en daarna  "Searching through
gopherspace using veronica."
<p>Je kan Veronica gebruiken voor praktisch alle soorten onderwerpen. In vele gevallen 
kom je dan terecht bij een Gopher-site naar het onderwerp waar je naar op zoek was. 
Tref je de mogelijkheden om Veronica niet aan bij je host, dan kan je altijd 
terecht bij een Gopher-site die Veronica wel heeft.
<p>Gopher maakt het hiernaast ook mogelijk om <i>bookmarks</i> (bladwijzers)
te maken. Een bladwijzer is een adres van een Gopher-site die je eerder 
hebt bezocht en van plan bent nog opnieuw te bezoeken. Gopher stelt je
dus in staat een lijst van bladwijzers aan te 
leggen, waaruit je op &eacute;&eacute;n van je zoektochten kan selecteren.
<h4>Hoe maak je die <i>Bookmarks</i>?</h4>
<p>Stel je bent op zoektocht binnen een Gopher-site. Op een bepaald ogenblik 
zie je een menu dat je interesseert en dat je graag als <i>Bookmark</i> 
wenst op te slaan. Je tikt op de hoofdletter A, waarna je een naam krijgt 
voor de bladwijzer. Je kan deze naam 
veranderen door de oorspronkelijke naam met <code>[backspace]</code> uit 
te wissen en een nieuwe naam in te tikken. E&eacute;nmaal dit gedaan, 
tik je op <code>[enter]</code>.
<p>Om je bladwijzers te gebruiken, tik je de hoofdletter V in. Hierna krijg 
je de lijst van je 
persoonlijke bladwijzers je kan selecteren, en waarmee je onmiddellijk 
verbonden wordt.
<p>Een interessante combinatie is bijvoorbeeld het cre&euml;ren van een 
bladwijzer waarmee je terecht kan op een site die je de mogelijkheid biedt 
om met Veronica (of Archie) te werken, indien je host deze service niet biedt.
<p>Een bladwijzer kan je verwijderen door in je lijst na het selecteren met 'V' de 
hoofdletter 'D' in te tikken.
<p>In deze korte bespreking hebben we reeds een aantal specifieke 
Gopher-commando's behandeld. Hierna volgt nog een lijst met enkele extra 
commando's en uitleg.
<h4>Gopher commando's</h4>
<b>a</b> Om een lijn toe te voegen van het Gopher-menu
aan je <I>Bookmark</i>-lijst.<br>
<b>A</b> Om een volledig Gopher aan je <i>Bookmark</i>-lijst toe
te voegen.<br>
<b>d</b> Om een bladwijzer te verwijderen.<br>
<b>q</b> Om Gopher te verlaten. Er zal worden gevraagd of
je dit werkelijk wilt.<br>
<b>Q</b> Om een Gopher-site te verlaten zonder dat je nog
eens gevraagd wordt of je dit wilt.<br>
<b>s</b> Om een bestand in je home directory op te slaan.<br>
<b>u</b> Om terug 'hoger' te gaan in een Gopher-structuur.<br>
<b>v</b> Bekijken van je <i>Bookmark list</i><br>
<b>=</b> Om informatie te krijgen over de server waar je
de site aantreft<br>
<b>></b> Vooruit gaan naar een volgend menu<br>
<b><</b> Terugkeren naar een vorig menu<br>
<p>En tenslotte om nog eens kort te herhalen: wil je naar een site waar 
je het adres van kent, tik dan
<blockquote>    <code>gopher SITENAME</code></blockquote>
<p>na de commandoprompt. Ken je geen adressen van een onderwerp waar je zoektocht 
naar uit gaat, gebruik dan Veronica.

<h1>Werken met Eudora</h1>
Eudora is een programma dat zowel onder het Mac- als onder het 
Windows-platform draait, en voorziet in een behoorlijk gebruiksvriendelijke 
interface voor het verzenden en ophalen van elektronische post. Eudora is 
dermate opgezet dat het meest geschikt is voor systemen waar maar &eacute;&eacute;n gebruiker 
op werkt, d.w.z. voor gebruik op computers waar maar &eacute;&eacute;n gebruiker 
geregeld gebruik maakt van de e-mail-mogelijkheid.

<p><hr><a name="A"><b>Postbussen (Mailboxes)</b></a><hr><p>

<center><P><img src="e2.gif" width=324 height=222></center>

<p>Eudora maakt gebruik van een systeem van postbussen
die je zelf kan maken, met als uitzondering drie standaard-postbussen:
<i>in</i> (binnenkomende post), <i>out</i> (uitgaande post) en <i>trash</i> (prullenmand).
Een postbus onder Eudora wordt als een venster weergegeven. Dit venster is
onderverdeeld in een aantal velden of kolommen (zie verder). Van links
naar rechts zijn dit: <i>status, sender/recipient</i> (zender/ontvanger),
<i>date</i> (datum), <i>length</i> (lengte in lijnen) en <i>subject</i> (onderwerp). <p>
Het 'status'-veld toont je of je al dan niet het berichtje reeds gelezen
hebt. Een zwart bolletje duidt ongelezen post aan. Staat er geen bolletje
dan is de post gelezen. Er kunnen in dit veld ook andere tekens
verschijnen waaronder belangrijke zijn: 'F' voor post die je hebt
verdergezonden <i>(forward)</i>, en 'S' wat post aanduidt die door jou is
verzonden (verschijnt als je gekozen hebt om de uitgaande berichten te
bewaren). 

<p><i>Trash</i> is de naam van de prullenmand. Een bericht dat je in de 
prullenmand stopt, kan er nog opnieuw worden uitgehaald. Wanneer je echter 
op <i>Empty trash</i> (maak de prullenmand leeg) klikt, verdwijnt het definitief.

<p><i>In</i> is de brievenbus waar de binnenkomende post geplaatst wordt.  Hier
staat dus de nieuwe post en alle post die je nog niet zelf verplaatst hebt
(d.m.v. <i>transfer</i>). 

<p><i>Out</i> is de brievenbus waar de uitgaande berichten geplaatst worden tot
ze verzonden worden. Kies je ervoor om kopies te maken van die berichten,
dan worden ze hier bewaard. 

<p>Je kan zelf brievenbussen bijmaken naar believen. Het is een goed idee
om brievenbussen te maken voor individuen of organisaties van wie je
geregeld post krijgt. Op die manier kan je de berichten effectief opslaan
en er makkelijker naar op zoek gaan. Gebruik het 'Transfer'-menu om
berichten van de ene brievenbus naar de andere te verhuizen of om ze uit
de prullenmand te halen. 

<p><hr><a name="B"><b>Bijnamen (Nicknames)</b></a><hr><p>

<center><P><img src="e3.gif" width=334 height=222></center>

Een bijnaam wordt ook wel eens een 'alias' genoemd. Een bijnaam of
'nickname' is een woord dat staat voor een e-mail-adres. Laten we eens
veronderstellen dat 'sup' een bijnaam is voor 'support@knooppunt.be'.
I.p.v. van 'support@knooppunt.be' in te tikken, kan je om hem een bericht
te zenden gewoon 'sup' intikken als je gebruik maakt van deze bijnaam. Je
kan ook bijnamen maken die gelden voor verscheidene e-mail-adressen. Dit kan
nuttig zijn wanneer je geregeld dezelfde berichten naar meerdere ontvangers
moet zenden. 
Je kan bijnamen maken door 'nicknames' te selecteren onder het menu
'special'. Hier kan je een persoonlijke collectie bijnamen maken en
eventueel verwijderen en/of aanpassen. 

<p> Het 'Nickname'-menu is tamelijk eenvoudig te gebruiken. De bijnamen
zelf staan in het linkerveld, de geassocieerde adressen in het
rechterveld, en eventuele nota's in het 'Notes'-veld. Met 'Rename'
verander je naam van de geselecteerde bijnaam, met 'Remove' kan je een
bijnaam verwijderen, en tenslotte met 'New' kan je er een toevoegen.
Andere functies maken het mogelijk om een bericht op te zenden
rechtstreeks naar de ontvanger ('To:'), als ontvanger van een kopie
('Cc:', 'Bcc:'). <p>

Om een nieuwe bijnaam toe te voegen moet je een naam intikken (spaties, %,
!, $, enz. zijn niet toegelaten, een mededeling wordt gegeven indien je
een fout maakt), en daarna tik je de e-mail-adressen in. <p>

Een klein trucje is het volgende: bij de optie 'new nickname' kan je 'put
it on the recipient list' selecteren. Op deze manier maak je het jezelf
makkelijker om later berichten te verzenden of verder te zenden. Deze
selectie geeft je de mogelijkheid om een bijnaam snel terug te vinden
onder het 'Message'-menu. <p>

Nieuwe bijnamen kan je snel aanmaken door een of meer berichten te
selecteren en daarna op 'make nickname...' onder het menu 'Special' te
klikken. Eenmaal een naam ingetikt, zal Eudora een bijnaam cre&euml;ren die
verwijst naar de adressen die geassocieerd zijn met de geselecteerde
berichten. 


<p><hr><a name="C"><b>Start:</b></a><hr>
<p>Eudora kan in het hoofdmenu opgestart worden of je kan
Eudora in de start-map van je computer plaatsen. 

<p><hr><a name="D"><b>Post opvragen</b></a><hr>
<p>
Eudora kan geconfigureerd worden om automatisch telkens wanneer een berichtje 
binnenkomt (met een zelf gekozen tijdsinterval) of bij het opstarten te 
controleren of er nieuwe post is. Indien er nieuwe post is dan zal Eudora dit
aangeven.

<P><center><img src="e4.gif" width=322 height=158></center>

<p>
Indien je niet van deze opties gebruik wenst te maken, of indien je niet wil
wachten op het voorbijgaan van de tijdsintervallen dan kan je eventuele nieuwe
post opvragen door in het 'File'-menu 'Check Mail' te selecteren.
<p>
Is er nieuwe post dan zal dit aangegeven worden.
<p><hr>
<a name="E"><b>Post lezen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Wil je een berichtje lezen, dubbelklik dan op het item dat je wilt 
lezen. <p>

<hr><a name="F"><b>Post beantwoorden</b></a>
<hr><p>
Wil je op een berichtje reageren <i>(replying)</i> ga dan naar het 'Message'-menu 
en selecteer 'Reply'. Eudora zal een nieuw bericht cre&euml;ren, geadresseerd aan
de afzender van het origineel, met een kopie van het origineel bijgevoegd, 
klaar om te bewerken.

<p><hr><a name="G"><b>Instellingen</b></a>
<hr><p>
Eudora werkt als volgt:
<p>
Controleren of er nieuwe post is en ontvangen van post:
<p>
1/Eudora legt een verbinding met een centrale mail server en 
kijkt uit naar nieuwe post.<br>  
2/Daarna laadt Eudora ongelezen mail op van deze server, en vernietigt 
(indien Eudora zo is ingesteld) de post op de server.<br>
3/Eudora verbreekt de verbinding met de server.<br>
4/De gebruiker kan zijn mail lezen, vernietigen of bewerken.<br>
<p>
Post verzenden:
<p>
1/Eudora legt een verbinding met een centrale server die post kan 
verzenden.<br>
2/Eudora geeft de uitgaande berichten door aan deze server, bericht
per bericht. Indien nodig zal Eudora berichten coderen, en de resulterende
informatie verzenden.<br>
3/Eudora verbreekt de verbinding met de server.<br>
<p>
POP Server:
<p>
POP (Post Office Protocol) is de methode die Eudora gebruikt om te kijken of 
post klaarstaat bij een mail server. De POP server is het systeem dat je
binnenkomende post klaarzet. Bij KnoopPunt is deze POP server 
naar.knooppunt.be of 192.168.32.254.<p>

POP Account: <p> Een POP account is uw login op de POP server. Elke
account heeft een login-naam en een hiermee geassocieerd paswoord. Een
lokale configuratie van Eudora neemt je login naam op, maar niet je
paswoord. Wanneer een gebruiker kijkt of er post voor hem of haar
klaarstaat, dan zal gevraagd worden naar dit paswoord. Ook indien het toch
mogelijk is, wordt aangeraden - waar privacy gewenst is - om Eudora
zodanig te configureren dat het paswoord niet herinnerd wordt.

<p> SMTP Server: <p> SMTP (Simple Mail Protocol) is de methode die Eudora hanteert
om mail te verzenden. Bij KnoopPunt stel je dit in op naar.knooppunt.be 
of op 192.168.32.254. <p>

Return Address: <p>Dit is het adres dat verschijnt in het 
'Reply-to'-veld in het e-mail-bericht, d.w.z. dit is het adres waarnaar een 
bericht zal worden gezonden wanneer je antwoordt. <p>

<hr><a name="H"><b>Terminologie</b></a><hr>

<p>Folder, map: <p> Dit een verzameling van berichten. Standaardmappen
zijn die met binnenkomende en ontvangen berichten. Indien je ervoor kiest
je uitgaande berichten te bewaren dan zal een 'sent-folder' gemaakt
worden. Dit is ook gekend als <i>mailbox</i>, brievenbus. Synoniemen voor
ontvangen en verzonden zijn <i>in</i> en <i>out</i>. 

<p> List Server: <p> Ook gekend als <i>mailing list, discussion group</i>,
etc. Dit is een groep van individuen verzameld onder een
gemeenschappelijke noemer die post uitwisselen als lid van een groep.
D.w.z. wanneer je post naar die groep verzendt, dan zal ieder lid een
kopie van je bericht ontvangen. Op Internet zijn massa's van die groepen
terug te vinden. 

<p> Host: <p> Dit is de computer die je e-mail-account 'herbergt', in jouw 
geval KnoopPunt. <p>

Domain: <p> 'knooppunt.be' is het domein waaronder de computers van
KnoopPunt vallen.

<p> Address: <p> Een uitdrukking die gebruikt wordt om
af te leiden waar een individu gelokaliseerd is op het Internet (bv.
support@knooppunt.be). Iedereen op het Internet kan berichtjes zenden naar
dit adres en relatief zeker zijn dat dit bericht aankomt.  <p>

Attachment/Enclosure: <p> Een <i>attachment</i> of <i>enclosure</i> is een bestand
dat meegezonden wordt met een e-mail-bericht. Hoewel essentieel deel
uitmakend van dit bericht, wordt het aangeduid als verschillend van de
rest van het bericht om achteraf z'n 'extractie' te vergemakkelijken.
<p><i>Attachments/enclosures</i> bieden de mogelijkheid om zaken te verzenden
via e-mail die geen blokken tekst zijn. E-mail dat in essentie een
text-only medium is, is niet direct geschikt om bv. tekeningen te
verzenden. Via <i>attachments</i> kan je bestanden gecodeerd verzenden om dit
probleem te omzeilen. De formaten hiervoor gebruikt, worden gewoonlijk
bijgevoegd bovenaan de <i>attachment</i>, en geven de gebruiker en de e-mail
client (Eudora is zo'n e-mail client) de gegevens voor de extractie van de
gecodeerde bestand. De meest gekende formaten zijn Binhex, uuencoding en
Mime. Eudora zal automatisch <i>attachments</i> decoderen die het als binhex of
mime ontvangt, en plaatst hierna de bestanden in de 'System folder' 
(systeemmap) van Eudora.
<i>Enclosures</i> verschillen van <i>attachments</i> in die mate dat de informatie in
het bericht zelf geplaatst wordt. <p>

<hr><a name="I"><b>Acties</b></a>
<hr><p>Mail: <p> Om een bericht te verzenden naar iemand moet je zijn of haar
e-mail-adres kennen. Eventueel zijn er verscheidene ontvangers van een
bericht, afgescheiden met een komma.

<p>Reply: <p> Als iemand je een bericht zendt, kan je hierop
reageren. Het mailprogramma zal automatisch het adres gebruiken dat bij
het origineel bericht zat.

<p>Forward: <p> Als iemand je een bericht gezonden heeft en je wil een
kopie van dit bericht doorzenden naar iemand anders dan kan je het bericht
'forwarden'. Hiervoor heb je wel het e-mail-adres nodig van de persoon
naar wie je het bericht wilt zenden. 

<p><hr><a name="J"><b>Benamingen</b></a>
<hr><p>Domain Name:
<p>
bv. knooppunt.be<br>
Duidt de organisatie aan die een aantal computers beheert. Deze machines 
beheren de e-mail-adressen van de gebruikers van deze organisatie, en bieden
een aantal diensten aan zoals WWW, FTP, Gopher, etc.
Met de twee letters op het einde van de domein naam wordt meestal het
land aangeduid waar het systeem gevestigd is. 'be' bv. staat voor Belgi&euml;.
Bestaan de laatste letters op het einde van de naam uit drie letters dan 
worden gebruikelijk systemen aangeduid die gevestigd zijn in de Verenigde
Staten. 'Com' bv. duidt een commercieel systeem in de VS aan, 'edu' een
educatieve instelling en 'gov' een overheidsinstelling.
Sommige landen hanteren benamen als bv. 'gov.au' (overheidsinstelling
in Australi&euml;)...
<p>
Host Name:
<p>
machinenaam.domein.naam
bv. naar.knooppunt.be.
Dit duidt een machine aan die gevestigd is aan een bepaald domein. 'naar' is
de machinenaam; 'knooppunt.be' is de domeinnaam.
<p>
E-mail-adres:
<p>
Dit is het adres waarnaar je schrijft als je een individu of een organisatie
wilt bereiken.

<h1>Work with Eudora</h1>
<P>Eudora is an application that runs on the Mac as well as DOS/Windows platforms, providing a fairly user-friendly interface to the wonderful world of electronic mail. Eudora is organised in such a manner that it is best suited to single user environment

s, ie. for use on computers where there is a single regular user.

<A name="mbox"><HR><B>Mailboxes:</B><HR></A>
<DD>Eudora uses a system of mailboxes, which you are free to arrange as you like, with the exception of the basic three, "in", "out" and "trash". 
<BR>A mailbox in Eudora, is viewed as a window. This is divided into a number of fields or columns (see below). From left to right the columns or fields are, "status", "sender/recipient", "date", "length" (in lines) and "subject".

<center><P><img src="e2.gif" width=324 height=222>
<P><i>The "in" box, showing incoming mail.</i></center>

<P><DT><DD>The "status" field at the very least shows whether you have read the mail item it refers to or not. A bullet (the black blotch) indicates unread mail. No bullet indicates read mail. At times other status indicators may appear, the only ones tha

t really matter are "F" for forwarded mail (ie you forwarded it), and "S" for sent mail (this appears if you choose to save your outgoing mail).

<P><DT><DD>"Trash" functions like the trash on the Macintosh desktop, it is where you put those things you want to get rid of. 

<P><DT><DD>"In" is the incoming mailbox. This is where new mail is put, and where all mail will stay until you "transfer" it elsewhere.

<P><DT><DD>"Out" is where the outgoing mail is kept until it is sent. If you choose to keep copies of all your outgoing mail, the copies will be kept here.

<P><DT><DD>You are able to create mailboxes as you like. It is a good idea to make mailboxes for those individuals or organisations you deal with often. You can store any incoming or outgoing messages for this party in its own mailbox making record keepin

g easy.
<BR>	Use the "Transfer" menu to move messages between mailboxes.
<P>
<DT>
<A name="nick"><HR><B>Nicknames</B><HR></A>
<DD>Also known as an "alias", a nickname is a word that stands in for an email address. eg. let's say that "mat" is an nickname for "m.carr@auckland.ac.nz", instead of typing "m.carr@auckland.ac.nz" to mail or forward things to M.Carr, just type "mat".
<BR>	It is possible to set up an nickname that is connected to a number of email addresses. This is useful where you often send the same message to many individuals, say memos, reminders, calendar events, etc. The figure below shows the definition of the 

nickname "akademix", a pointer to a number of email addresses.
<BR>	Nicknames are edited by choosing "nicknames" under the "special" menu. This allows you to create, delete and modify your personal collection of nicknames.

<center><P><img src="e3.gif" width=334 height=222>

<P><i>Nicknames.</i></center>

<P><DT><DD>The nicknames dialogue box is a fairly straightforward thing to operate. The nicknames are listed in the field on the left, the address(es) associated with the selected nickname in the top right field, and any notes you wish to make about the a

lias can be put in the "Notes" field.
<BR>"Rename" will change the name of the selected nickname, "Remove" will remove the selected nickname, and "New" will make a new one. The other buttons allow you to put a nickname into a message as either the recipient ("To:"), or the recipient of a "car

bon copy" ("Cc:", "Bcc:").

<P><DT><DD>Making a new nickname involves typing in a name (no spaces, %s !s $s, etc allowed, it will tell you if you try), and then typing in all the email addresses.

<P><DT><DD>The only real bit of trickiness is the "put it on the recipient list" option that appears in the "new nickname dialogue box. Putting a nickname on the recipient list makes it easier to get at when you want to send or forward messages later on. 

Essentially checking this box will mean that the nickname you are creating will be available quickly under the "message" menu.

<P><DT><DD>New nicknames can be made by selecting a message (or group of messages) in any mailbox, and then choosing "Make nickname..." under the "special" menu. Once you have typed in a name, Eudora will create a nickname pointing to the address(es) asso

ciated with the selected message(s).
<P>
<DT>
<A name="strt"><HR><B>Startup:</B><HR></A>
<DD>As it is configured here Eudora can be activated by going to the apple menu and selecting the "-&gt; email", or (as it may appear on some machines) the "-&gt;eudora" entry.
<BR>Eudora can be made to startup automatically when the machine is started up or restarted, it will stay active in the background keeping an eye out for incoming mail.
<P>
<DT>
<A name="chck"><HR><B>Checking Mail:</B><HR></A>
<DD>Eudora may be configured to automatically check for mail at startup and then intermittently after a specified time interval. If there is email, eudora will give a little fanfare (an abstraction of a crowing rooster?) and display the following message.



<P><center><img src="e4.gif" width=322 height=158>

<P><i>New mail!</i></center>

<P><DT><DD>If you do not have the automatic facility set up, or you do not wish to wait the specified amount of time for eudora to check whether you have received any new mail, then you are able to force it to check your mail by going to the "file" menu a

nd selecting "check mail".

<P><DT><DD>If there is mail, you will see the dialogue box shown above, if not, eudora will apologise and tell you that there is no mail for you.
<P>
<DT>
<A name="read"><HR><B>Reading Mail:</B><HR></A>
<DD>So you have received mail, and wish to read it now. Double click on the item you want to read. easy!
<P>
<DT>
<A name="rply"><HR><B>Replying:</B><HR></A>
<DD>In Eudora, either select the item you wish to reply to, go to the "message" menu and choose "reply", or, if you are reading the message, just go straight to the "message" menu and choose "reply".
<BR>Eudora will create a new message, addressed to the sender of the original, with a copy of the original ready to edit.
<P>
<DT>
<A name="sett"><HR><B>Settings:</B><HR></A>
<P><DD>Eudora works as follows:

<LI>Eudora disconnects from the forwarding host.
</OL>
<P>
<DT><B>POP server</B>
<DD>POP (Post Office Protocol) is the method Eudora uses to check for a download mail from a mail server. The POP server is the host that holds your incoming mail. As it is used in the Faculty, the POP server is <B>ccu1.auckland.ac.nz</B>.
<DT><B>POP account</B>
<DD>A POP account is a login on the POP server. As it is used in the Faculty, the POP account is an account on ccu1. Each account has a login name and a password associated with it. Local configuration of Eudora sets the login name, but does not supply th

e password. When the user checks for mail in Eudora, they will be prompted for the appropriate password.
<BR>Though it is possible, it is advisable, that where privacy is a concern, Eudora is not configured to remember the password.
<DT><B>SMTP server</B>
<DD>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the method Eudora uses to forward mail. Once again, as used by the Faculty, this can be one of <B>ccu1.auckland.ac.nz</B>, or <B>mailhost.auckland.ac.nz</B>.
<BR>The way mail forwarding is configured in the University it seems ccu1 is the best option.
<DT><B>Return address</B>
<DD>This is the address that will appear in the reply-to field of the email message, ie. where any reply to the email message will be sent. This is generally of the form a.name@auckland.ac.nz.

<P>
<DT>list server
<DD>Also known as a "mailing list", "discussion group", etc. A group of individuals collected under some general subject/interest heading who are able to share email across all the members of the group. ie. when you mail to the group, every member of the

<DD>The computer that "hosts" the mail account. eg. "ccu1.auckland.ac.nz" is the name of the host on which most of the email users in the ArchPropPlan faculty have accounts.
<P>
<DT>domain
<DD>A grouping of hosts/machines. "auckland.ac.nz" is the name of the local domain that covers all the computers belonging to the University of Auckland. sbsu1.auckland.ac.nz, ccu1.auckland.ac.nz, planav1.sapp.auckland.ac.nz are part of this domain.
<P>
<DT>address
<DD>An expression that can be used to determione an indivual or device anywhere on the internet. "m.carr@auckland.ac.nz" is a unique individual. "ccu1.auckland.ac.nz" is a unique machine. Anyone anywhere on the internet (therefore anywhere within the reac

h of the human technical sphere) can specify these address and be fairly certain of reaching their target.
<P>
<DT>attachment/enclosure
<DD>An attachment or enclosure is a file that is carried along with an email message. Though essentially part of the email message, it is marked out as being <i>different</i> from the rest of the message to facilitate its <i>extraction</i> upon receipt.
<BR>Attachments/enclosures provide a means by which things other than blocks of text may be transmitted via email. Email being essentially a text only medium, is not so good for transmitting say, images in their native form, so attachments are quite often

 files that have been encoded in a text format.
<BR>The formats used for this are usually included at the top of the attachment, and provide a cue for either the user, or the email client (Eudora is an email client) for the extraction of the encoded information. The main formats are binhex (this is the

 format used by Eudora), uuencoding (used by Pegasus mail, and others) and mime.
<BR>Eudora will automatically decode any attachments it recieves encoded as binhex, placing the extracted files in the Eudora folder in the System folder.
<BR>Enclosures differ to attachments only in that the information "enclosed" is placed between the email message and the signature.
<P>
</DL>
<DT>
<A name="actn"><HR><B>Actions:</B><HR></A><DD>
<DL><P>
<DT>mail
<DD>send a message to somebody. You need to know the recipient's email address. There can be one or many recipients of a message.
<P>
<DT>reply
<DD>Someone has sent you a message, and you are replying to it. The mail program will automatically use the email address attached to the original message.
<P>
<DT>forward
<DD>Someone has sent you a message and you want to send a copy to someone else you feel will be interested in it. Requires the email address of the person you are sending a copy to.
<P>
<DT>bounce
<DD>Someone has sent you a message and it should go elsewhere. Bounce will send the message to the new address.
<P>
<DT>flame
<DD>berate a person because of their ignorance, stupidity or prejudices (though it just as easily be because of your own ignorance, stupidity or prejudices). This happens a lot on the internet for a variety of reasons, petty and serious. Don't be afraid, 

"sticks and stones..."
<BR>At times flaming can be damaging. A number of people can, in effect, "gang up" on one person sending the individual a large amount of information collectively, causing that person's email account to malfunction.
<BR>The email accounts we generally give out in the School have a capacity of 500K. This amounts to about 80000 words or one fairly decent image. If one of these accounts was sent a number of images, it would quickly exceed its resource allocation and cau

se problems for ther account owner, and the system manager...
<BR>If you offend a group of people, this may happen.
<BR>There is a case of a person being arrested by the FBI for saying nasty treasoness type things about the US president.
<P>
<DT>spam
<DD>blatant self promotion on any of the media available through the internet. Some love it, some hate it. If you indulge in spam you may get flamed.
</DL>
<P>
<DT>
<A name="form"><HR><B>Form:</B><HR></A><DD>
<DL><P>
<DT>domain name
<DD><i>domain.name</i> 
<BR>eg. auckland.ac.nz
<BR>specifies the institution organisation that looks after a range of machines. This will quite often handle email addresses for most of the users of machines in the domain, and have a variety of services such as WWW, FTP, Gopher, etc....
<BR>the two letters at the end of one of these names usually specifies the country the domain inhabits geographically. "nz" for New Zealand, "au" for Australia, "se" for Sweden, "ch" for Switzerland, "de" for Germany, etc... Those with three letter are no

rmally organisations based in the States. "com" indicates a US commercial site, "edu" indicates an educational institution, "gov" a government institution.
<BR>Australia adopts the US "convention" resulting in domain suffix combinations like "edu.au" and "gov.au", etc.
<BR>New Zealand, the UK, Germany and others use another "convention".
<BR>".ac.nz" indicates an NZ educational institution, "ac.uk", "ac.de", etc indicate institutions in the UK and Germany.... ".co.nz" indicates a n NZ based commercial operation, "govt.nz" indicates a government agency....
<P>
<DT>host name
<DD><i>machinename.domain.name</i>
<BR>eg. ccu1.auckland.ac.nz Simply a machine name prefixed to a domain name. "ccu1" is the machine name, "auckland.ac.nz" the domain.
<P>
<DT>email address
<DD><i>name@host.name</i>
<BR>eg. mat@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz. "mat" is the name of the individual, "ccu1.auckland.ac.nz" is the name of the host. This is where you are mailing to an individual whose login name you know for a specific machine.
<P><i>name@domain.name</i>
<BR>eg. m.carr@auckland.ac.nz. "m.carr" is the name of the individual, "auckland.ac.nz" is the name of the domain. Usually this form of email address is an alias to the form cited above. ie. "m.carr@auckland.ac.nz" is an alias to "mat@ccu1.auckland.ac.nz"

. The advantage of this form is that "mat" can use a machine other than "ccu1", without having to change his email address from "m.carr@auckland.ac.nz".

<hr><p>
Als je je eigen <i>home page</i> op het Wereldwijde Web (WWW) wil hebben, of 
zelfs een hele <i>web site</i> (een structuur van verschillende 
WWW-bladzijden), dan heb je in principe twee mogelijkheden. Ofwel laat je het
werk aan een specialist over, ofwel probeer je zelf je infobladzijden in 
elkaar te knutselen. In het eerste geval wend je je best tot 
<a href="mailto:support@knooppunt.be">KnoopPunt Support</A> (support@knooppunt.be).
Wat het gaat
kosten kan je in de <a 
href="http:/ned/info/prijzen/index.html">KnoopPunt-prijslijst</A>
vinden.<br>
Als je echter zelf je infobladzijden wil samenstellen, dan zijn de  
volgende alinea's dat wat je nodig hebt.
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="html"><b>HTML leren</b></A>
<hr><p>
De eerste stap is het leren van HTML. HTML is de afkorting van <i>Hypertext
Markup Language</i> en het is de computertaal waarin alle WWW-pagina's
zijn geschreven. HTML leren kan je op drie manieren:
<ul>
<LI>Je kan een boekhandel binnenstappen en een handboek kopen. Een goed
boek is <i>Het HTML-boek. Leidraad voor het maken van grafische,
interactieve World Wide Web-pagina's</i> van Larry Aronson,  
uitgegeven bij A.W.Bruna Informatica (ISBN 90-229-3881-6).
<LI>Als volleerd surfer kan je natuurlijk via de 
<a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/roadmap/help.html">zoekrobots</a> zelf HTML-handleidingen gaan 
opsporen. We helpen je echter een handje: kijk eerst eens naar 
<a href="http://huizen.dds.nl/~florisb/handl.html">de handleiding van
Floris Bos</a>.
<LI>De derde en wellicht de beste oplossing is dat je even cursus gaat
volgen bij de KnoopPunt Webmaster. Zo'n cursus duurt in principe van 10 tot
15 uur en heeft meestal plaats op zaterdag. Het is een praktijkcursus
zodat je je eigen HTML-werkjes onmiddellijk via Netscape of een andere
browser kan bekijken. Meer info vind je op de
<a href="http://www.knooppunt.be/info/training/index.html">cursusbladzijde</A>
van KnoopPunt. De datum van de volgende cursus krijg je van
<a href="mailto:support@knooppunt.be">KnoopPunt Support</A>
(support@knooppunt.be).
</ul>
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="tekst"><b>Tekstverwerkers</b></A>
<hr><p>
Wanneer je denkt HTML onder de knie te hebben, dan kan je je eerste bladzijde
gaan schrijven. Er bestaan op de markt een hele reeks speciale tekstverwerkers
voor HTML, maar als je er zo geen hebt, dan gaat het even goed met een 
eenvoudige "platte-tekstverwerker". Voorbeelden hiervan zijn <b>Edit</b> 
onder
DOS, <b>Kladblok</b> onder Windows en <b>Leertekst</b> op het Mac-platform.
Als je uitsluitend een volledige tekstverwerker hebt - d.w.z. een tekstverwerker waarmee
je ook cursief, vet e.d. kunt afdrukken - dan kan die ook dienen op voorwaarde dat
je al die snufjes niet gebruikt (Een woord maak je vet door HTML-instructies
toe te voegen, en niet door op de knop "vet" in je tekstverwerker te klikken.) Bovendien
moet je in zulke tekstverwerker je HTML-bestanden opslaan als "platte
ASCII-tekst". In het programma <b>Write</b> bijv. noemt men dat "opslaan als  
tekstbestand", in <b>MS Word</b> "bestand opslaan als alleen tekst". 
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="naam"><b>Naamgeving</b></A>
<hr><p>
De naam waaronder je je HTML-bestand opslaat is belangrijk. Er zijn twee
aspecten:
<ul><li>De extensie: Een HTML-bestand op de KnoopPunt-server (en op vrijwel alle
andere servers) moet op .html eindigen. Geldige HTML-bestandsnamen zijn bijv.
index.html, les-1.html, dit_is_mijn_goudvis.html. Als je op een Mac werkt of
onder Windows95, dan geef je je bestanden dus best meteen een naam die op .html eindigt. 
Als dat niet kan (onder DOS of Windows 3.1 bijv.) dan geef je de bestanden de 
extensie .htm. 
<li>De <i>home page</i>: Als je slechts &eacute;&eacute;n HTML-bestand op de
server plaatst, dan moet dat bestand de naam <code>index.html</code>
hebben. Als je er
meer hebt, dan is <code>index.html</code> het bestand van waaruit links naar al je
andere bestanden vertrekken. <code>Index.html</code> is dus de 
<i>home page</i> of hoofdpagina
die leidt naar alle andere nevenpagina's.
</ul>
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="test"><b>Je HTML-pagina testen</b></A>
<hr><p>
Wanneer je HTML-bestand klaar is en op schijf opgeslagen, dan ga je het best
eerst met een browser bekijken vooraleer je het op de KnoopPunt-server
plaatst. De manier waarop dat gebeurt hangt af van het systeem dat je
gebruikt:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Op het Mac-platform</b> is alles het eenvoudigst. Je zet je modem 
af, dubbelklikt op het Netscape-icoontje en je wacht tot Netscape is opgestart. 
Ga nu naar het menu <i>File</i> en klik op <i>Open file ...</i>. Je
selecteert het HTML-bestand dat je hebt gemaakt en je nieuwe <i>home page</i>
verschijnt (hopelijk) in al zijn glorie!
<p><li><b>Onder Windows 3.1 of 3.11</b> zet je de modem aan. Daarna  
open je
het venster van het programma Trumpet Winsock, zonder evenwel 
<i>Dialler</i> aan te klikken. Daarna verklein je het Trumpet-venster of ga je met
<code>[control][esc]</code> opnieuw naar het KnoopPunt-venster. Daar dubbelklik 
je op Netscape. Nu kan je via het menu <i>File</i> en via <i>Open file 
...</i> je HTML-bestand bekijken.
</ul>
<p><b>Een gulden tip:</b> Als je meer dan &eacute;&eacute;n browser hebt, bijv. Netscape 1 en 2 en 3,
of Mosaic, bekijk dan je HTML-bestand met al die programma's. Het gebeurt
dat een klein programmeringsfoutje (bijv. het vergeten van een sluit-aanhalingsteken)
dat door &eacute;&eacute;n browser niet wordt opgemerkt, in een andere leidt tot
het verliezen van een stuk tekst.<p>
<b>Tip 2:</b> Als je nog veranderingen aanbrengt aan je HTML-bestand
terwijl je "in Netscape zit", dan moet je na iedere verandering op
de <i>Reload</i>-knop klikken.
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="server"><b>Naar de server!</b></A>
<hr><p>
Het grote moment is er dan. Je <i>home page</i> is geschreven en uitgetest.  
Nu moet je ze alleen nog op de KnoopPunt-server plaatsen opdat de wereld ze
zou kunnen bekijken.
<ul>
<li>Leg een verbinding op de gewone manier (Trumpet Winsock,
Config PPP, enz.).
<li>Start daarna onder Windows het programma WS-FTP, onder 
Mac het programma Fetch. De eerste maal dat je die programma's start, wordt
gevraagd je e-mail-adres op te geven.
<li>Tik nu na <i>Host</i> de woorden <code>ftp.knooppunt.be</code> of
de getallen <code>192.168.32.254</code>, na <i>Userid</i> je 
gebruikersnaam en na <i>Password</i> je paswoord.
<li>Klik nu op <i>Connect</i>.
Je krijgt nu in WS-FTP een venster met links een overzicht van de
bestanden op je eigen computer, rechts een overzicht van de
bestanden in je home directory bij KnoopPunt. In Fetch zie je alleen
een venster met de bestanden op de KnoopPunt-server.
<li>Als het de eerste keer is
dat je HTML-bestanden op de server plaatst, dan is het noodzakelijk een
aparte directory te maken speciaal voor die bestanden. Die
directory moet <code>public_html</code> heten (tussen de twee woorden 
staat het lage streepje, in het Engels <i>underscore</i>). Maak de
directory door te klikken op <i>New directory</i> (In Fetch op het Mac-platform
moet je klikken op het menu <i>Directories</i> en dan op <i>Create
new directory</i>).
<li>Ga daarna naar die nieuwe 
directory ofwel door erop te dubbelklikken, ofwel door &eacute;&eacute;n
maal te klikken
en dan te klikken op <i>Change directory</i> (In Fetch onder het menu
<i>Directories</i>).
<li>Je kunt nu in WS-FTP met de 
pijltjesknoppen (de pijltjesknoppen op je scherm, niet de pijltjestoetsen
op je toetsenbord) het HTML-bestand dat je hebt gemaakt overzetten naar
je nieuwe directory <code>public_html</code>. In Fetch doe je hetzelfde
maar met de knop <i>Put</i>.
</ul>
<p>
Als je onder Windows 3.1 of 3.11 werkt moet je bovendien nu nog de extensie
.htm veranderen in .html. Dat kan je doen door op <i>Change name</i> te
klikken.
<p><hr>
<li><A NAME="adres"><b>De adressen of URL's van je pagina's</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als dat alles gebeurd is, kan je je pagina bekijken vanop iedere 
Internet-browser ter wereld. Je kan vanaf nu bijv. op je briefpapier het 
adres of URL van je <i>home page</i> vermelden (URL is de afkorting
van Uniform Resource Locator, 
uniforme bronverwijzing, en je <i>home page</i> is die HTML-bladzijde
die je "index.html" hebt genoemd).
<br>De URL van je <i>home page</i> is 
<code>http://www.knooppunt.be/~LOGINNAAM</code> waarin je 
<code>LOGINNAAM</code> natuurlijk moet vervangen door je echte loginnaam 
bij KnoopPunt.
<br>Als je in je directory <code>public_html</code> nog andere 
bestanden hebt gezet, dan hebben die als URL 
<code>http://www.knooppunt.be/~LOGINNAAM/BESTANDSNAAM</code>.
<br>In je directory <code>public_html</code> kan je indien gewenst nog 
subdirectory's maken met daarin andere HTML-pagina's of bijv.
grafische afbeeldingen. Als je dat hebt 
gedaan, dan is de URL van die bestanden 
<code>http://www.knooppunt.be/~LOGINNAAM/SUBDIRECTORY/BESTANDSNAAM</code>. 
<P><hr>
<li><A NAME="lieven"><b>Een seintje aan de Webmaster</b></A>
<hr><p>
Als allerlaatste stap geef je aan de <a href="mailto:webmaster@knooppunt.be">Webmaster
van KnoopPunt</a> (webmaster@knooppunt.be)
een seintje dat je de trotse bezitter van een nieuwe <i>home page</i>
bent. Hij zal dan nog even controleren of alles in orde is.

Steun aan de Esperantobeweging

He! Leuk dat je op deze bladzijde hebt geklikt. Dat bewijst dat je wel
wat voelt voor de idee van een internationale taal. Hoe kun je ons helpen?
Wel, er zijn tientallen manieren.
</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Vooreerst kun je aan anderen laten weten dat er zoiets als Esperanto
bestaat. Als je mensen kent waarvan je weet dat ze zich hiervoor
interesseren, geef dan hun naam en adres aan ons. Je kunt dat doen
met ons <A HREF="mendilon.html">elektronisch infoformulier</A>, met een
elektronisch berichtje aan <A HREF="mailto:fel@knooppunt.be">fel@knooppunt.be</A>
of, zoals in de goeie ouwe tijd, met een briefje aan de
Vlaamse Esperantobond, Frankrijklei 140, B-2000 Antwerpen. Je vrienden
of kennissen (of jij zelf!) krijgen dan meer info op papier. Natuurlijk
zonder enige bijbedoelingen. De Esperantobond is een vereniging zonder
winstbejag.
<LI>Een tweede mogelijkheid is een gift. We zijn dan wel een vereniging
zonder winstbejag, maar zonder geld kunnen we helaas geen informatie
over het Esperanto verstrekken. Alle giften, grote en kleintjes, zijn
welkom op een van de volgende rekeningnummers:
<UL>
<LI>000-0265338-43
<LI>001-2376527-06
<LI>402-5510531-55
</UL>
Giften van 1000 frank of meer zijn onder bepaalde voorwaarden aftrekbaar
van je belastbaar inkomen.
<LI>Of wil je ons steunen zonder dat het een frank kost? Ook dat kan. Als
je een spaarrekening bij de ASLK hebt, dan kun je meedoen aan het
Krekelsparen. Jij krijgt evenveel rente als altijd, maar de ASLK geeft
daar bovenop een percentje dat ten goede komt aan de Esperantobeweging.
Meer inlichtingen hierover kun je gratis krijgen
(<A HREF="mailto:fel@knooppunt.be">fel@knooppunt.be</A>).
<LI><I>Last but not least</I>, of <I>Laste sed ne balaste</I> zoals ze in
het Esperanto zeggen, je kunt een aantal boeken in of over Esperanto
kopen voor jezelf of voor anderen, of een cd of een cassette met
Esperantoliedjes. Kijk gerust even naar ons <A HREF="nl.html">boekenaanbod
in het Nederlands</A> of naar de volledige lijst
<A HREF="stoko.html">Esperantoboeken</A>.
</UL>
Bedankt voor je interesse!

Kijk vijf seconden naar het tekeningetje en tracht het dan,
zonder naar je scherm te kijken, opnieuw te tekenen. Onmogelijk?
Toch wel. Leg even een blad papier of je hand
precies op de linkerhelft van de tekening. Op die
manier zie je de structuur erin en wordt onthouden opeens
heel wat gemakkelijker.
<P>
Ook in taal zit structuur. Er bestaat een verband tussen vellen en
vallen, tussen berg en gebergte, tussen werken en werktuig. Die
structuur leren opmerken maakt het leren van talen een stuk
gemakkelijker.
<P>
Zoals hierboven het blad papier of de hand
ons iets deed ontdekken, zo doet
Esperanto ons opnieuw ontdekken wat taal is, hoe het in elkaar zit,
welke structuren erin leven. Met Esperanto wordt vreemde talen leren
een prettige uitdaging!

De 16 regels van het Esperanto
</H3>
<H2>
Beknopte grammatica
</H2>
Ter inleiding: de uitspraak
<PRE>
  c   [ts]     vb  centro   [tsentro]  = centrum
     [tsj]    vb  ar      [tsjar]    = want, omdat
  g   [Fr. g]  vb  tago                = dag
     [dzj*]   vb  ao      [adzjo]    = leeftijd
          * zoals de eerste klank van "gentleman"
     [ch]     vb  aoso    [chaoso]   = chaos
     [zj]     vb  urio    [zjoerio]  = jury
     [sj]     vb  i       [sji]      = zij
  u   [oe]     vb  turo     [toero]    = toren
     [w]      vb  ato     [awto]     = auto

q, w, x en y bestaan niet in het Esperanto.


Regel 1 : Er is slechts het bepaald lidwoord 'la'.     la libro = het boek
-------   Het onbepaald lidwoord wordt niet vertaald.     libro = een boek


Regel 2 : Het zelfstandig naamwoord eindigt op -o      vb.  patro  (vader)
-------   Het meervoud krijgt de uitgang -j            vb.  patroj (vaders)
          Het lijdend voorwerp krijgt de uitgang -n    vb.  patron, patrojn
          (accusatief)


Regel 3 : Het bijvoeglijk naamwoord eindigt op -a    vb.  bona (goede)
-------   Het krijgt dezelfde uitgangen als het      vb.  bonaj patroj
          zelfst. naamwoord waar het bijhoort.            bonan patron


Regel 4 : De telwoorden zelf zijn onveranderlijk.
-------
          0  nulo
          1  unu        6  ses          11  dek unu
          2  du         7  sep          12  dek du
          3  tri        8  ok           20  dudek
          4  kvar       9  na         100  cent
          5  kvin      10  dek        1000  mil

     Je kan er wel zelfstandige en bijvoeglijke   vb.  duo, trio
     naamwoorden van maken door de gepaste        vb.  tria, sesa
     uitgang toe te voegen.
     De uitgang -ono maakt een breuk.             vb.  1/2  duono
     De uitgang -opo maakt een groep.             vb.  duopo (paar)


Regel 5 : De persoonlijke voornaamwoorden :    mi  (ik)    ni  (wij)
-------                                        vi  (jij)   vi  (jullie,u)
          (Bezittelijk : mia, via, ...)        li  (hij)  ili  (zij, mv)
                                               i  (zij)
                                               i  (het)
                                               oni (men)
Regel 6 : De werkwoorden worden niet vervoegd.
-------
            - infinitief eindigt op -i       vb.  fari (doen)
            - tegenwoordige tijd    -as      vb.  mi faras, ili faras, ...
            - verleden tijd         -is      vb.  mi promenis
            - toekomende tijd       -os      vb.  li vidos

            - voorwaardelijke wijs  -us      vb.  i farus (zij zou doen)
            - gebiedende wijs       -u       vb.  sidu (zit)

    Onvoltooid deelwoord : faranta : aan het doen
                           farinta : aan het doen geweest
                           faronta : zal aan het doen zijn

     Voltooid deelwoord  : farata : gedaan wordend
                           farita : gedaan
                           farota : zal gedaan worden

Regel 7 : Het bijwoord eindigt op -e         vb.  rapide (snel)
-------   Het is onveranderlijk.

          Trappen van vergelijking :  pli rapide ol  (sneller dan)
                                      plej rapide    (snelst)


Regel 8 : Alle voorzetsels vereisen een nominatief.
-------


Regel 9 : Fonetische spelling : alles wordt uitgesproken zoals het
-------   wordt geschreven.


Regel 10 : De klemtoon valt altijd op de voorlaatste lettergreep.
--------   vb. la'bori (werken)


Regel 11 : Samenstellingen worden gemaakt door het samenvoegen van de
--------   afzonderlijke delen (zoals in het Nederlands), met het
           hoofdwoord achteraan.   vb.  leterpapero  (briefpapier)


Regel 12 : Dubbele negatie wordt niet gebruikt (zoals in het Nederlands)
--------   dus niet : 'neniam ne' (nooit niet), maar : 'neniam' (nooit).


Regel 13 : Bij een beweging, krijgt het woord dat de plaats aanduidt waar
--------   men naartoe gaat de uitgang -n, indien er geen voorzetsel
           gebruikt werd.    vb.    kie vi iras  =  waar ga je
                                (al kie vi iras  =  naar waar ga je)
           zonder voorzetsel :     kien vi iras  =  naar waar ga je


Regel 14 : Ieder voorzetsel heeft een vaste betekenis. vb en = in (binnen)
--------   Vb.  'geloven in'  is niet  'kredi en'
                             maar wel  'kredi je'
           Dit is vooral voor het figuurlijk gebruik van voorzetsels.


Regel 15 : Internationaal gebruikte woorden veranderen niet in Esperanto
--------   (enkel de fonetische spelling moet soms aangepast).
           vb. teatro (theater), lifto, radio, ...


Regel 16 : De uitgangen van het naamwoord en het lidwoord (la) kunnen worden
--------   weggelaten en vervangen door een weglatingsteken.

<H3><A NAME="Uitspraak"></A>Uitspraak</H3>

<I>C</I><P>
De letter c altijd als de ts van muts of van tsaar
uitspreken. Spreek de c nooit als k of s uit.<P>
<I>cento</I>: niet sento zoals in het Frans maar tsento<BR>
<I>ceteroj</I>: niet seteroj zoals bij etcetera maar
tseteroj<BR>
<I>certe</I>: niet serte zoals in het Frans maar tsertee<P>

<I>E</I><P>
De letter e altijd vol uitspreken. De stomme e (de
uh-klank van bijvoorbeeld de en ze) komt in het Esperanto niet
voor.<P>
<I>sane</I>: niet sanuh maar saanee<BR>
<I>vere</I>: niet veruh maar veeree<P>

<I>G</I><P>
De letter g altijd hard uitspreken, zoals bij het
Engelse great en het Franse gar&#231;on. De zachte g wordt gevormd
door de letter &#182;.<P>

<I>H</I><P>
De letter h valt nooit weg maar wordt altijd
nadrukkelijk aangeblazen.<P>
<I>hodia&#253;</I>: niet odia&#253; maar hodie-a&#253;<BR>
<I>hela</I>: niet ela maar heelaa<BR>
<I>havi</I>: niet avi maar haavie<P>

<I>I</I><P>
De letter i moet altijd als ie worden uitgesproken, en
nooit als korte i zoals bijvoorbeeld in kip of ik.<P>
<I>kripla</I>: niet zoals in het Engelse cripple maar
kriepla<BR>
<I>kripo</I>: niet zoals kribbe maar kriepoo<P>
De tweeklank ie bestaat niet in het Esperanto, dus als men deze twee
letters achter elkaar tegenkomt moet men ze beide
uitspreken. <P>
<I>alie</I>: niet aalie maar aalie-ee <BR>
<I>trie</I>: niet trie maar trie-ee<P>
Ook de ei en de ij bestaan niet.<P>
<I>reiri</I>: niet reirie maar ree-ierie<BR>
<I>rijeto</I> niet rij-eeto maar riejeetoo<P>

<I>O</I><P>
De tweeklank oe bestaat evenmin in het Esperanto. <P>
<I>poento</I>: niet poento maar po-ento <BR>
<I>poemo</I>: niet zoals in puma maar po-eemo<BR>
<I>Groenlando</I>: niet zoals Groenland maar gro-enlando<P>

<I>U</I><P>
De letter u altijd als oe uitspreken (zoals in het
Duitse gut), en nooit als uu zoals in muur. <P>
<I>muro</I>: niet muuro maar moero <BR>
<I>truko</I>: niet zoals truuk maar troeko<P>
De letter &#253; vormt de enige tweeklanken in het Esperanto,
namelijk de a&#253; en de e&#253;. Andere tweeklanken zoals de
ie, de oe, de ij en de ei bestaan niet. Zij mogen dus ook niet
worden uitgesproken. Let goed op of er een accent op de letter u staat. Als
er geen accent staat is het geen tweeklank. <P>
<I>reuzi</I>: niet zoals in reus maar ree-oezie<BR>
<I>praulo</I>: niet praulo maar pra-oelo<P>
Als er wel een accent op de letter u staat is het uiteraard wel een
tweeklank. <P>
<I>na&#253;zi</I>: niet naa-oezie maar nauzie<BR>
<I>na&#253;</I>: niet naa-oe maar nau zoals in pauw.<P>

De letters q, w, y en x komen in het Esperanto niet voor. Men
moet ze daarom ook helemaal niet gebruiken. In internationale
woorden geldt:<P>
q wordt k, kv of ku, dus niet quanto maar <I>kvanto</I> en niet qualito
maar <I>kvalito</I>.<BR>
x wordt ks of kz, dus niet extra maar <I>ekstra</I> en niet
extrapoli maar <I>ekstrapoli</I>.<BR>
y wordt i, dus niet hysterio maar <I>histerio</I>.<BR>
w wordt v, dus niet watto maar <I>vatto</I>.<P>

De letters &#230;, &#248;, &#182;, &#188; en &#254; zijn
afzonderlijke zelfstandige letters. In het algemeen versterkt het accent de
uitspraak van de oorspronkelijke letter.<P>

<H3><A NAME="Klemtoon"></A>Klemtoon</H3>

De klemtoon ligt altijd op de voorlaatste lettergreep, ook bij
woorden waar het Nederlands de klemtoon anders pleegt te leggen. Bij
woorden van &#233;&#233;n lettergreep ligt de klemtoon uiteraard op
deze ene lettergreep. Een lettergreep wordt gevormd door een
klinker of tweeklank met eventueel de medeklinkers die eromheen staan.<P>
niet op<I>i</I>nio maar opi<I>ni</I>o
niet pro<I>jek</I>cio maar projek<I>ci</I>o<P>

<H3><A NAME="Lidwoorden"></A>Lidwoorden</H3>

De lidwoorden <I>de</I> en <I>het</I> worden in het Esperanto
altijd vertaald met <I>la</I>, maar het onbepaalde lidwoord <I>een</I>
wordt niet vertaald, bijvoorbeeld:<P>
<I>Mi vidas arbon.</I> Ik zie een boom.<BR>
<I>Mi vidas unu arbon.</I> Ik zie 1 boom. <BR>
<I>Mi prenis glason.</I> Ik nam een glas. <BR>
<I>Mi prenis unu glason.</I> Ik nam 1 glas. <P>

<H3><A NAME="Lijdend"></A>Lijdend voorwerp, -n, vierde naamval</H3>

Het lijdend voorwerp is dat deel van de zin dat de handeling van het
werkwoord ondergaat, bijvoorbeeld: hij slaat <I>de fiets</I>, of ik open
<I>de kast</I>. Een van de lastigste onderdelen van
Esperanto is het gebruik van de -n uitgang om de 4de naamval (het lijdend
voorwerp) aan te duiden. In het Nederlands gebeurt dit
via de woordvolgorde, maar dit is in het Esperanto zeker niet het geval.
Vergelijk: <P>
<I>Johano vidas la gardiston.</I> <BR>
<I>La gardiston vidas Johano.</I><P>
Beide zinnen betekenen hetzelfde, terwijl in het Nederlands de
betekenis wordt omgedraaid:<P>
Jan ziet de bewaker.<BR>
De bewaker ziet Jan.<P>
In het Nederlands herkennen wij het lijdend voorwerp doordat het achter het
werkwoord staat. In het Esperanto heeft het lijdend
voorwerp de -n uitgang. Men moet zichzelf door veel oefening het gebruik
van de -n uitgang aanleren. Daarom volgen hier de nodige voorbeeldzin-
nen:<P>
<I>Li lerte riparis la biciklon.</I> <BR>Hij herstelde handig de
fiets.<P>
<I>Petro purigas la telerojn kaj kuirpotojn.</I><BR>
Peter maakt de borden en pannen schoon. <P>
<I>&#222;i atente legas la revuojn.</I><BR>
Zij leest aandachtig de tijdschriften.<P>
<I>Kaseda magnetofono povas registri kaj rea&#253;digi muzikon kaj
sonojn.</I><BR> Een cassetterecorder kan muziek en geluiden opnemen en weer
doen horen.<P>
<I>La pluvo multe malsekigis la grundon.</I><BR>
De regen maakte de grond zeer vochtig.<P>
<I>En la milito ni supervenkos ilin.</I><BR>
In de oorlog zullen wij hen overwinnen. <P>
<I>Ni &#230;iuvespere a&#253;skultis la rakontojn de Johano.</I><BR>
Wij luisterden iedere avond naar de vertellingen van Jan.<P>
<I>Mendu ankora&#253; kelkajn botelojn da lakto.</I> <BR>
Bestel nog enige flessen melk.<P>
<I>Dum la printempo la unuaj folioj bele ornamas la parkojn kaj
arbarojn.</I> <BR>Gedurende de lente versieren de eerste bladeren
mooi de parken en bossen. <P>
<I>Ni bone povas uzi la novan kameraon.</I><BR>
Wij kunnen goed de nieuwe filmcamera gebruiken.<P>
<I>Nia fi&#254;kaptado preska&#253; malplenigas la maron.</I><BR>
Onze visvangst maakt de zee bijna leeg. <P>
<I>La eta knabino dis&#254;iris la malnovan gazeton.</I><BR>
Het kleine meisje scheurde de oude krant uiteen.<P>
<I>La meblojn li elektis tre maloportune.</I> <BR>
Hij koos de meubels zeer ongeschikt.<P>
<I>La komputilo tre &#254;an&#248;os nian mondan civilizacion.</I><BR> De
computer zal onze wereldbeschaving zeer veranderen. <P>
<I>La rabistoj &#254;telos &#230;ion se vi ne bone fermas la
pordon.</I><BR>
De rovers zullen alles stelen als jij niet goed de deur sluit.<P>
<I>Li krude forpu&#254;is la aliajn homojn por havi liberan
vojon.</I><BR>
Ruw duwde hij de andere mensen weg om vrije baan te hebben.<P>
<I>Se vi ne ekzercas vian korpon, vi ne vivos sane.</I><BR>
Als jij niet je lichaam oefent, zul je niet gezond leven. <P>
<I>La mallonga brilado de la suno ka&#253;zas la vintron.</I><BR>
Het korte schijnen van de zon veroorzaakt de winter.<P>

Let vooral goed op als een zin uit hoofdzin en bijzin bestaat,
want zowel de hoofdzin als de bijzin kunnen een eigen lijdend
voorwerp hebben, bijvoorbeeld:<P>
<I>Mi traktas la etajn aferojn, kiujn li ne volis trakti.</I><BR>
Ik behandel de kleine zaken, die hij niet wilde behandelen.<P>
<I>La infanoj, kiuj verkis la libreton, anka&#253; prelegis
&#248;in.</I><BR>
De kinderen, die het boekje schreven, lazen het ook voor. <P>

<H3><NAME="Afstand"></A>Afstand, tijd, richting</H3>

De -n uitgang wordt eveneens toegepast bij maat, prijs, gewicht, afstand,
afmeting of tijd, bijvoorbeeld: <P>
<I>Li voja&#248;is du kilometrojn.</I> Hij reisde twee
kilometer.<BR>
<I>&#222;i atendis tri horojn.</I> Zij wachtte drie uren.<BR> <I>Li
mortis la okan de marto.</I> Hij stierf de achtste van
maart.<P>
In deze gevallen kan men ook voorzetsels gebruiken. <P>
Li voja&#248;is je du kilometroj. <BR>
&#222;i atendis dum tri horoj.<BR>
Li mortis en la oka de marto.<P>

De -n uitgang kan evenwel ook worden gebruikt om een beweging of verplaat-
sing aan te duiden. Dikwijls kunnen wij deze uitgang dan met <I>naar</I>
vertalen. In dat geval staat de uitgang na een
voorzetsel of achter een bijwoord. Bij de voorzetsels al (aan,
naar) en &#248;is (tot) staat nooit een dergelijke uitgang omdat deze
voorzetsels zelf al een beweging of verplaatsing
benoemen.<P>
<I>Li kuras en la parko.</I> Hij rent in het park. <BR>
<I>Li kuras en la parkon.</I> Hij rent het park in. <BR>
<I>La rato saltas en la tubo.</I> De rat springt binnen in de
buis.<BR>
<I>La rato saltas en la tubon.</I> De rat springt de buis in.<BR>
<I>Ni promenas hejme.</I> Wij wandelen thuis.<BR>
<I>Ni promenas hejmen.</I> Wij wandelen naar huis.<BR>
<I>La kuniklo iras sub la arboj.</I> Het konijn gaat onder de bomen.<BR>
<I>La kuniklo iras sub la arbojn.</I> Het konijn gaat naar
onder de bomen in.<BR>
<I>Ni veturas urben.</I> Wij rijden naar de stad.

<H3><A NAME="Zelf"></A>Zelfstandige en bijvoeglijke naamwoorden</H3>

Een zelfstandig naamwoord is eenvoudigweg de naam van iets,
bijvoorbeeld de fiets, het weer, de politiek enzovoort. Een
bijvoeglijk naamwoord zegt iets van het zelfstandig naamwoord
waar het bijhoort, bijvoorbeeld de <I>zware</I> tak, het
<I>hoge</I> huis.<BR>
Het bijvoeglijk naamwoord kan voor of achter het zelfstandig
naamwoord staan, bijvoorbeeld:<P>
<I>vojo malluma</I> een donkere weg<BR>
<I>la birdo malrapida</I> de langzame vogel<P>
Als het zelfstandig naamwoord in het meervoud staat dan staan de erbij
behorende bijvoeglijke naamwoorden ook in het meervoud. <P> <I>la ru&#248;a
&#254;ranko</I> de rode kast<BR>
<I>la ru&#248;aj &#254;rankoj</I> de rode kasten<BR>
<I>la brua hundo</I> de luidruchtige hond<BR>
<I>la bruaj hundoj</I> de luidruchtige honden<BR>
<I>la verda stelo</I> de groene ster<BR>
<I>la verdaj steloj</I> de groene sterren<P>
Als het zelfstandig naamwoord de -n uitgang heeft, dan hebben de
bijbehorende bijvoeglijke naamwoorden ook deze uitgang.<P>
<I>Li tuj &#254;altas du grandajn lumojn.</I><BR>
Hij schakelde
meteen twee grote lichten aan.<P>
<I>&#198;u vi nur havas tri maldikajn valizojn? </I><BR>
Heb jij slechts drie dunne koffers? <P>
<I>Mi povus man&#248;i e&#230; ses ravajn pladojn.</I><BR>
Ik zou zelfs zes verrukkelijke schotels kunnen eten. <P>
Het bijvoeglijk naamwoord hoeft niet altijd voor of achter het
zelfstandig naamwoord waar het bijhoort te staan. Als het
bijvoeglijk naamwoord deel uitmaakt van het zogeheten gezegde
staat het bij het werkwoord. Het gezegde drukt de kernhandeling van de zin
uit. Het bestaat uit een of meerdere werkwoorden met mogelijk zelfstandige
naamwoorden en bijvoeglijke naamwoorden,
bijvoorbeeld:<P>
<I>Mi volas helpi lin.</I> Ik wil hem helpen. <P>
Het gezegde bestaat hier uit twee werkwoorden, te weten <I>volas hel-
pi</I>.<P>
<I>Mi estas malsana.</I> Ik ben ziek.<P>
Het werkwoord alleen (esti) zegt niets, alleen met het
bijvoeglijk naamwoord erbij krijgt het zijn betekenis (<I>esti
malsana</I> = ziek zijn).<P>
<I>&#222;i i&#248;os flegistino.</I> Zij zal verpleegster
worden. <P>
Het werkwoord <I>i&#248;i</I> (worden) alleen betekent niets.
Daarom moet men het zelfstandig naamwoord <I>flegistino</I>
toevoegen. Uiteraard moet men goed opletten of een zelfstandig
naamwoord of bijvoeglijk naamwoord tot het gezegde behoort.
Verwar een zelfstandig naamwoord in het gezegde niet met het
onderwerp van de zin. <P>
<I>Surduloj estas homoj.</I> Doofstommen (=onderwerp) zijn
mensen (=gezegde).<P>

<H3><A NAME="Werkw"></A>Werkwoorden - deelwoorden<P></H3>

De zogeheten deelwoorden van het werkwoord zijn niets anders dan bij-
voeglijke naamwoorden.<P>
<I>vidinta</I> gezien hebbend<BR>
<I>vidita</I> gezien geworden<BR>
<I>vidanta</I> aan het zien<BR>
<I>vidata</I> gezien wordende<BR>
<I>vidonta</I> op het punt te zien<BR>
<I>vidota</I> zullende gezien worden<P>
Als zij bij een zelfstandig naamwoord in het meervoud horen dan krijgen zij
dus ook de meervouds-j. <P>
<I>Mi estas lavanta.</I> Ik ben aan het wassen.<BR>
<I>Ili estas lavantaj.</I> Zij zijn aan het wassen.<BR>
<I>&#222;i estas ju&#248;ota.</I> Zij gaat berecht worden.<BR> <I>Ni
estas ju&#248;otaj.</I> Wij gaan berecht worden.

<H3><A NAME="Bepaling"></A>Bepaling van gesteldheid</H3>

Het bijvoeglijk naamwoord kan ook nog als zogeheten bepaling van ges-
teldheid voorkomen. De bepaling van gesteldheid is een soort kruising
tussen een bijvoeglijk naamwoord en een bijwoord. De
bepaling van gesteldheid krijgt nooit de -n uitgang van het
lijdend voorwerp. <P>
<I>Li faras la a&#253;ton rapidan.</I> <BR>Hij maakt de snelle
wagen.<P>
<I>Li faras la a&#253;ton rapida.</I> <BR>Hij maakt de wagen snel.<P>
<I>Li faras la a&#253;ton rapide.</I> <BR>Hij maakt snel de wagen.<P>
In de middelste zin zegt <I>rapida</I> iets over hoe de wagen
wordt onder invloed van het werkwoord <I>fari</I>.<P>
<I>Li masa&#248;as la muskolojn suplajn.</I><BR>
Hij masseert de soepele spieren.<P>
<I>Li masa&#248;as la muskolojn suplaj.</I><BR>
Hij masseert de spieren soepel. <P>
<I>Li masa&#248;as la muskolojn suple. </I><BR>
Soepel masseert hij de spieren.<P>
<I>Li faras la laboron malfacilan.</I><BR>Hij doet de moeilijke arbeid. <P>
<I>Li faras la laboron malfacila.</I><BR>Hij maakt de arbeid
moeilijk.<P>
<I>Li faras la laboron malfacile.</I> <BR>Moeilijk maakt hij de
arbeid.<P>
Het bijwoord, met zijn uitgang op -e, heeft twee grote
verschillen met het=20bijvoeglijk naamwoord, te weten:<P>
1) Het kent geen meervoud en ook geen lijdend voorwerp vorm,
bijvoorbeeld: <I>la a&#253;to iras rapide</I> en ook <I>la
a&#253;toj iras rapide</I>.<BR>Het bijwoord kan wel een
richtings-n hebben, bijvoorbeeld: <P>
<I>Ni veturas dekstre</I> Wij rijden rechts.<BR>
<I>Ni veturas dekstren</I> Wij rijden naar rechts.<P>
2) Het hoort nooit bij een zelfstandig naamwoord, terwijl een
bijvoeglijk naamwoord altijd bij een zelfstandig naamwoord in
dezelfde zin hoort.

<H3><A NAME="Bijwoorden"></A>Bijwoorden</H3>

Een bijwoord kan iets zeggen over de volgende zinsdelen:<P>
1) Het werkwoord, bijvoorbeeld: <P>
<I>Li tajpas diligente.</I> Hij typt ijverig.<P>
Onderscheid dit goed van het gezegde in: <I>Li estas
diligenta</I>. <I>diligente</I> zegt iets over het <I>tajpi</I>,
<I>diligenta</I> is een eigenschap van <I>li</I>. Ook ten
opzichte van de bepaling van gesteldheid is er een verschil.<P> <I>&#222;i
trikas malakurate.</I> <BR>Zij breit slordig.<P> <I>&#222;i estas
malakurata.</I> <BR>Zij is slordig.<P> <I>Petro &#230;arpentas
precize.</I> <BR>Peter timmert nauwkeurig.<P>
<I>Petro &#230;arpentas &#248;in preciza.</I><BR>
Peter maakt het door timmeren nauwkeurig.<P>
<I>Petro estas preciza</I><BR>
Peter is nauwkeurig. <P>
2) Een bijvoeglijk naamwoord. Let ook hier weer op. <P>
<I>Li estas rapide pensanta viro.</I><BR>
Hij is een snel-denkend man. <BR>
<I>Rapide</I> zegt iets over de wijze van denken.<P>
<I>Li estas rapida pensanta viro.</I><BR>
Hij is een snel en denkend man. <P>
<I>&#222;i &#254;atas montri bele purajn vestojn. </I><BR>
Zij houdt ervan mooi-zuivere kleren te tonen. <P>
<I>&#222;i &#254;atas montri belajn purajn vestojn.</I><BR>
Zij houdt ervan mooie en zuivere kleren te tonen.<P>
3) De gehele verdere zin, bijvoorbeeld: <P>
<I>Unue mi volas diri mian dankon ke ...(kaj tiel plu). </I>
Ten eerste wil ik mijn dank zeggen dat ... enzovoort.<P>
4) Een ander bijwoord, bijvoorbeeld: <P>
<I>La trajno iras fulme rapide.</I> De trein gaat
bliksemsnel.<BR>
<I>Li grimpas simie lerte.</I> Hij klimt aapachtig handig.<BR> <I>Li
skribis delikate bele.</I> Hij schreef verfijnd mooi.<P> Als het onderwerp
van de zin is weggelaten dan moet men eventuele bijvoeglijke naamwoorden
vervangen door bijwoorden,
bijvoorbeeld:<P>
<I>&#216;i aspektas malnova.</I> Het ziet er oud uit.<BR>
<I>Aspektas malnove.</I> `t Ziet er oud uit.<BR>
<I>La vento blovas forte.</I> De wind blaast sterk.<BR>
<I>Blovas forte.</I> `t Waait sterk. <P>
Er is nu immers geen zelfstandig naamwoord meer in de zin waar
het bijvoeglijk naamwoord bij kan horen. Dit geldt ook voor
bijzinnen waar het weggelaten onderwerp hetzelfde is als dat van de
hoofdzin. <P>
<I>Tuj avertite, li rapide forfu&#248;is.</I><BR>
Meteen gewaarschuwd geworden, vluchtte hij snel weg.<P>
Vergelijk:<BR>
<I>Post kiam li tuj estis avertita, li rapide
forfu&#248;is.</I><BR>
<I>La&#253;te dankante, li forlasis nin malfrue. </I><BR>
Luid bedankende verliet hij ons laat. <BR>
Vergelijk:<BR>
<I>Dum li estis la&#253;te dankanta, li forlasis nin
malfrue.</I>

<H3><A NAME="Voorzetsels"></A>Voorzetsels</H3>

De regel 1 woord = 1 betekenis geldt in het bijzonder bij de
voorzetsels. Daarom moeten wij hier goed opletten. <P>
Met<BR>

<I>per</I> = met behulp van <BR>
<I>kun</I> = samen met <P>
Voor<BR> <I>anta&#253; la domo</I> = voor het huis <BR>
<I>anta&#253; la tria horo</I> = voor het derde uur
<BR>
 <I>pro</I> = wegens<BR>
 <I>por</I> = omwille van, ten bate van, om te <P>
Langs<BR> <I>preter</I> = voorbij<BR>
 <I>la&#253;</I> = parallel, gelijklopend met<P>
Bij<BR> <I>apud</I> = in de buurt van <BR>
 <I>&#230;e</I> = dichtbij, ten huize van <P>
Behalve<BR> <I>krom</I> = bovendien <BR>
 <I>escepte de</I> = met uitzondering van<P>
Over<BR> <I>pri</I> = betreffende <BR>
 <I>trans</I> = overheen<P>
Door<BR> <I>tra</I> = doorheen <BR>
 <I>per</I> = door middel van<P>
Veel voorzetsels in vaste uitdrukkingen vertalen wij in het
Esperanto met het onbepaalde voorzetsel <I>je</I>,
bijvoorbeeld:<P>
<I>Je via servo.</I> Tot uw dienst.<BR>
<I>Je la kvina tago de aprilo.</I>Op de vijftiende van april.<BR> <I>Mi
atendas je la a&#253;tobuso.</I>. Ik wacht op de bus.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="Aanwijzende"></A>Aanwijzende voornaamwoorden</H3>

Het woordje dat kunnen wij vertalen met <I>tio</I> of <I>tiu</I>.
<I>Tio</I> wordt altijd zelfstandig toegepast en verwijst altijd naar
dingen, nooit naar personen. Bij aanwijzend gebruik van dat moet men het
woordje <I>tiu</I> gebruiken. <P>
<I>Tio estas vera.</I> Dat is waar. <BR>
<I>Mi rigardis tion plezure.</I> Ik bekeek dat met
genoegen.<BR>
<I>Tiu libro enhavas la veron.</I> Dat boek bevat de
waarheid.<BR>
<I>Mi &#254;atas tiun statuon</I> Ik hou van dat standbeeld.<P> Tiu
verwijst bij zelfstandig gebruik altijd naar personen.<P>
<I>Tiu forportis la sakojn.</I> Die droeg de zakken weg.<BR>
<I>Ni devas denunci tiujn.</I> Wij moeten diegenen
verklikken.<P>

<H3><A NAME="Zich"></A>Zich (wederkerig voornaamwoord)</H3>

Het woordje zich is bij sommige werkwoorden al in de betekenis
mee inbegrepen. Men hoeft het dan niet nog eens extra te vertalen door
<I>sin</I>. <P>
<I>mi hontas</I> = ik schaam me (niet <I>mi hontas min</I>). <BR> <I>li
enuas</I> = hij verveelt zich (niet <I>li enuas sin</I>). <BR>
<I>&#254;i memoras</I> = zij herinnert zich. <BR>
<I>vi &#248;ojas</I> = jij verheugt je.

<H3><A NAME="Nabij"></A>Nabije toekomst</H3>

In het Nederlands gebruiken wij voor de nabije toekomst vaak de
tegenwoordige tijd. Dit is in het Esperanto niet toegestaan.
Steeds als het over de toekomst gaat moeten wij de toekomende
tijd gebruiken. <P>
<I>Mi venos morga&#253;</I> <BR>Ik kom morgen (niet <I>Mi venas
morga&#253;</I>).<BR>
<I>Anta&#253; la vespero mi estos ree.</I><BR>
Voor de avond ben ik terug (niet: <I>Anta&#253; la vespero mi
estas ree</I>).

<H3><A NAME="Indirect"></A>Indirecte rede<P></H3>

In de indirecte rede veranderen wij in het Nederlands de tijd van het
werkwoord. Dit gebeurt nimmer in het Esperanto.<P>
<I>Li diris: "Mi ankora&#253; vizitos vin".</I><BR>
Hij zei:"Ik zal jullie nog bezoeken."<P>
<I>Li diris ke li ankora&#253; vizitos nin.</I><BR>
Hij zij dat hij ons nog zou bezoeken.

<H3><A NAME="Dubbel"></A>Dubbele betekenissen</H3>

Sommige woorden hebben in het Nederlands twee of meer
betekenissen. In het Esperanto zijn er dan twee afzonderlijke
woorden.<P>
Bal<BR> <I>la balo</I> = het bal<BR>
 <I>la pilko</I> = de bal<P>

<H2>De Vlaamse Esperantobond v.z.w.</H2>
Het doel van de Vlaamse Esperantobond is informatie te verschaffen over
de internationale taal Esperanto, cursussen te organiseren en te helpen
bij alle toepassingen van deze taal voor het Vlaamse publiek.
<P>
Esperanto is een plantaal. Daarom is ze vlugger aan te leren dan een
etnische taal.
Omdat het geen taal is van een natie of een volk is het
leren en gebruiken van Esperanto een bewuste daad van toenadering
zoeken tot anderstaligen. De contacten via het Esperanto brengen mensen
dan ook vlugger tot betere en diepere communicatie.
Een derde voordeel van het Esperanto is zijn propedeutische waarde.
Verschillende wetenschappelijke experimenten hebben bewezen dat het
aanleren van Esperanto als eerste vreemde taal het aanleren van andere
vreemde talen versnelt.
<P>
Om haar doel te bereiken beschikt de Vlaamse Esperantobond over twee
pijlers: het Esperantocentrum en 15 plaatselijke groepen.

Het Esperantocentrum in Antwerpen heeft 7 personeelsleden (en een
wisselende reeks vrijwilligers). Drie werknemers komen deeltijds,
zodat eigenlijk 5 voltijdse opdrachten worden volbracht. Het centrum
is er uiteraard voor elke vorm van informatie aan het publiek. Er is
o.a. een opzoekingsbibliotheek over taalproblemen, die vooral nuttig
blijkt voor studenten, die aan een thesis in dit verband werken.
<P>
Op het centrum wordt het tijdschrift <I>Horizontaal</I>, een blad in het
Nederlands over taalproblemen en over de mogelijkheden van het Esperanto,
helemaal uitgewerkt, zowel redactie, zetwerk, montage, illustratie,
druk, afwerking en verzending. Hetzelfde geldt voor het maandblad
<I>Monato</I>,
een nieuwsmagazine in het Esperanto. Het bijzondere van dit tijdschrift
is dat de auteurs hoofdzakelijk mensen zijn, die schrijven over problemen
in hun eigen omgeving. Dit is net het tegengestelde van onze gewone
nieuwsmedia, die het nieuws uit de wereld rapporteren, gezien door
onze bril.
<P>
In Antwerpen worden bovendien jaarlijks een 5 tot 10 eigen uitgaven
de wereld ingezonden. Het gaat om informatiebrochures en documenten,
maar ook om leerboeken en boeken van alle mogelijke genres: po&#235;zie,
romans, novellen, toneel, essays, wetenschappelijk werk, enz. Sinds
zijn oprichting in 1978 heeft de VEB al een 50-tal boeken uitgegeven.
Deze uitgaven vinden - evenals het blad <I>Monato</I> - hun weg naar het
buitenland. De Vlaamse Esperantobond is internationaal erkend als
een van de meest dynamische verenigingen. Zo speelt ze de rol
van een cultureel ambassadeur voor Vlaanderen (zij het niet officieel).
<P>
De tweede pijler is het werk van de vrijwilligers in 15 lokale
afdelingen in Aalst, Antwerpen, Beringen, Brugge, Genk, Gent, Hasselt,
Houthalen, Kalmthout, Knokke, Kortrijk, Leuven, Oostende, Tienen
en Turnhout. Die zorgen voor informatie op plaatselijk vlak, voor
het inrichten van een 25-tal cursussen, voor lezingen, voor het
begeleiden van mensen, die Esperanto willen gebruiken en voor het
opvangen van buitenlandse gasten.
<P>
Beide takken stellen zich ten dienste van andere verenigingen of
individu&#235;n, die informatie verlangen, informatievoordrachten of
cursussen willen inrichten. De dienst bestaat niet alleen in het
ter beschikking stellen van personen, die informatie verstrekken
of les geven, maar ook in het opstellen van artikels, het bezorgen
van infofolders, affiches of tentoonstellingsmateriaal.

Manifest van Praag</H3>
<H4>van de beweging van de internationale taal Esperanto</H4>

Wij, leden van de wereldwijde beweging ter bevordering van het Esperanto, richten
dit manifest aan alle regeringen, internationale organisaties en mensen van
goede wil; verklaren ons voornemen om met vaste wil verder te werken aan de
volgende doelstellingen en nodigen elke organisatie en iedere persoon afzonderlijk uit
zich hierbij aan te sluiten.
<P>
Het Esperanto,
in 1887 gelanceerd als project voor een hulptaal ten behoeve van internationale
communicatie en snel ge&euml;volueerd tot een levende taal vol nuances,
functioneert al meer dan een eeuw om mensen over grenzen van taal en cultuur
heen te verbinden. Ondertussen hebben de doeleinden van zijn sprekers niet aan belang
en actualiteit ingeboet. Waarschijnlijk zullen noch het wereldwijde gebruik van
enkele nationale talen, noch de vorderingen in de communicatietechniek, noch het
ontdekken van nieuwe methoden van taalonderricht de volgende principes
verwezenlijken, die wij essentieel achten voor een rechtvaardig en doeltreffend
taalgebruik.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>DEMOCRATIE. Een communicatiesysteem dat bepaalde mensen voor het leven
bevoorrecht, maar dat van anderen eist, dat ze er jarenlang energie in
investeren om een minder hoog niveau van taalbeheersing te bereiken, is
fundamenteel ondemocratisch. Hoewel het Esperanto, zoals elke taal, niet volmaakt
is, overtreft het elke rivaal in hoge mate wat betreft een gelijkwaardige,
wereldwijde communicatie. Wij beweren dat taalongelijkheid,
communicatie-ongelijkheid op alle niveaus tot gevolg heeft, inclusief op
internationaal niveau. Wij vormen een beweging voor democratische communicatie.
<P>
<LI>TRANSNATIONAAL. Elke nationale taal is gebonden aan een bepaalde cultuur en
een bepaald volk of land. De leerling die, bijvoorbeeld, Engels leert, leert ook
over de cultuur, de geografie en politiek van Engelstalige landen, voornamelijk
de Verenigde Staten en Groot-Brittanni&euml;. De leerling die Esperanto leert,
leert over een wereld zonder grenzen, waarin elk land als thuis wordt
gepresenteerd. Wij beweren, dat het onderricht in een nationale taal gebonden is
aan een bepaald wereldbeeld. Wij vormen een beweging voor transnationaal
onderricht.
<P>
<LI>PEDAGOGISCHE EFFECTIVITEIT. Slechts een klein percentage van degenen, die
een
vreemde taal leren, leren die echt beheersen. Volledige beheersing van het Esperanto
is zelfs mogelijk via zelfstudie. Verschillende onderzoeken hebben aangetoond
dat het leren van Esperanto een propedeutisch effect heeft op het leren van
andere talen. Men beveelt Esperanto ook aan als centraal onderdeel in cursussen,
die leerlingen ervan bewustmaken wat taal is. Wij beweren, dat de moeilijkheid
van nationale talen altijd een belemmering vormt voor veel leerlingen, die toch
voordeel zouden hebben van een tweede taal. Wij vormen een beweging voor
doeltreffend taalonderricht.
<P>
<LI>MEERTALIGHEID. De Esperanto-gemeenschap is
&eacute;&eacute;n
van de weinige
taalgemeenschappen op wereldschaal, waarvan de sprekers zonder uitzondering
twee- of meertalig zijn. Elk lid heeft de taak op zich genomen ten minste
&eacute;&eacute;n
vreemde taal te leren tot op spreekniveau. In veel gevallen leidt dat tot de
kennis van en de liefde voor verscheidene talen en over het algemeen tot een bredere
persoonlijke horizon. Wij beweren, dat de sprekers van alle talen, grote en
kleine, zouden moeten beschikken over de re&euml;le
kans zich een tweede taal eigen
te maken tot op spreekniveau. Wij vormen een beweging die in die kans voorziet.
<P>
<LI>TAALRECHTEN. De ongelijke machtsverdeling tussen de talen leidt tot
voortdurende taalbedreiging of rechtstreekse taalonderdrukking bij een groot
deel van de wereldbevolking. In de Esperantogemeenschap treffen sprekers van
grote en kleine, offici&euml;le en niet-offici&euml;e
talen elkaar op neutraal terrein,
dankzij de wederzijdse wil compromissen te sluiten. Zo'n evenwicht tussen
taalrechten en verantwoordelijkheden schept een precedent om andere
oplossingen voor taalongelijkheid en taalconflicten te ontwikkelen en op waarde
te schatten. Wij beweren, dat de grote machtsverschillen tussen de talen
garanties op gelijke behandeling zonder onderscheid naar taal ondergraven, zoals
die in zoveel internationale documenten zijn gegeven. Wij vormen een beweging
voor taalrechten.
<P>
<LI>TAALVERSCHEIDENHEID. De nationale regeringen neigen ertoe de grote
verscheidenheid in talen in de wereld te zien als belemmering voor communicatie
en ontwikkeling. Voor de Esperantobeweging echter, is de verscheidenheid in
talen een voortdurende en onmisbare bron van rijkdom. Bijgevolg heeft elke taal,
zoals elke soort van leven, al waarde in zichzelf en verdient bescherming en
ondersteuning. Wij beweren, dat de politiek van communicatie en ontwikkeling,
indien niet gebaseerd op respect voor en ondersteuning van alle talen, leidt tot
het uitsterven van de meerderheid van de talen van de wereld. Wij vormen een
beweging ten behoeve van taalverscheidenheid.
<P>
<LI>EMANCIPATIE VAN MENSEN. Elke taal bevrijdt en beknot de sprekers ervan,
enerzijds door ze de mogelijkheid te geven onderling te communiceren, anderzijds
door de communicatie met anderen te belemmeren. Opgezet als een universeel
communicatiemiddel, is het Esperanto een van de grootste functionerende projecten
van de emancipatie van mensen; een project om het ieder mens mogelijk te maken
als individu deel te nemen aan de menselijke gemeenschap, met stevige wortels
in zijn lokale culturele en taalkundige identiteit, maar zonder er door beperkt
te worden. Wij beweren, dat het exclusieve gebruik van nationale talen
onvermijdelijk belemmeringen opwerpt voor de vrijheid van uitdrukken,
communicatie en vereniging. Wij vormen een beweging voor de emancipatie van
mensen.

<H2>De sociale dimensie</H2>
<H4>
Het is een beetje verwonderlijk, maar bijna van bij het begin van de
geboorte van het Esperanto als beweging, is zij gekenmerkt - en misschien
zelfs enigszins verlamd - door de discussie over politiek en neutraliteit.
Die discussie uitte zich in de realiteit in de diametrale opstelling
``progressief'' (de sociale idee) en ``burgerlijk'' (de neutraliteit). Daarmee
weerspiegelt de Esperantobeweging perfect de gangbare denkpatronen in de
wereld. Datzelfde fenomeen doet zich ook voor op plaatselijke schaal.
M.a.w., wat leeft in de maatschappij, leeft ook in de Esperantowereld. De
toenemende mondigheid van mensen die zich ``progressief'' noemen in de
maatschappij, vindt dan ook logischer wijze zijn spreekbuis in de
Esperantowereld. In het mei-juni nummer van JEN (en ook elders) verscheen
een <I>Alvoko al progresemaj esperantistoj en la nederlandlingva regiono</I> van
Jacques Schram. Wij nemen de tekst hier in vertaling over.
</H4><H3>
Is een Esperanto-arbeidersbeweging nodig?
</H3>
Arbeiders zijn door de voortschrijdende automatisering een verdwijnend ras,
en daarom raakt het woord ``arbeider'' zelf uit de mode. De werknemers die
computers en ingewikkelde machines bedienen, noemen zich geen arbeiders
meer. Maar betekent dat ook dat zij hun rechten niet meer mogen of hoeven
te verdedigen? Het gebruik van computergestuurde machines veroorzaakt niet
alleen meer werkeloosheid, maar ook een steeds grotere roofbouw van
grondstoffen, een vernietiging van de natuur, terwijl tal van andere dingen
slachtoffer worden van het huidige arbeidssysteem.
<P>
Ook het woord ``klassestrijd'' raakt uit de mode, meer zelfs, het verloor
elke betekenis. In feite roven wij westerse ``geliberaliseerde'' mensen de
rijkdommen uit wat wij ``de derde wereld'' noemen. Kunnen wij ongestoord,
misschien zelfs onbewust, die overconsumptie voortzetten? Is eigenlijk niet
de tijd gekomen dat wij moeten zeggen: Stop de verdere vernietiging van de
aarde? Stop de uitbuiting van de derde wereld? Is niet de tijd gekomen dat
progressieven gaan samenwerken? Zelfs als we aanvaarden dat ``arbeider'' en
``klassestrijd'' tot de industri&#235;le archeologie behoren, moeten wij dan toch
niet toegeven dat een progressieve kracht meer dan ooit nodig is?
<P>
Wanneer progressieve esperantosprekers voort blijven gaan met hun eigen
graf te delven en - enkel drijvend op de Esperantobeweging - geen interesse
tonen voor wat er buiten de beweging omgaat, dan mogen wij terecht
twijfelen aan de noodzaak van een internationaal communicatiemiddel, dan
mogen wij terecht twijfelen aan de noodzaak van het Esperanto.
<P>
Wij moeten vechten voor de bio-diversiteit van en het respect voor planten,
dieren &#233;n mensen. Een moeilijke opdracht? Helemaal niet. De grote
multinationale ondernemingen tonen ons hoe het moet. Zij slechten alle
grenzen, zij ondernemen wereldwijd, en gebruiken de volgens hen machtigste
taal, zonder de minste aandacht voor de problemen die deze taal eventueel
aan anderen bezorgt. Zij vervuilen de lucht wereldwijd, zij vernietigen de
natuur grensoverschrijdend. Zij zijn de ``echte'' internationalisten, en hun
enige doel - zeg maar obsessie - ``geld verdienen'' leidt tot minachting en
verkrachting van milieu, biodiversiteit, of wat dan ook.
<P>
Moeten wij dan in onze stoel blijven zitten, voor de televisie, ons
vergapend aan hongerende kindjes en oorlogen van politieke machthebbers
wier enige zorg is de eigen macht te versterken? Zij weten goed dat hun
kiesvee de arbeiders zijn. Zij propageren nationalisme, opdat mensen binnen
vaste grenzen zouden weten aan welke keizer zij belastingen moeten betalen,
welke natie schuld heeft aan de gekke koeien, en onder welke vlag zij
andere ``proleten'' moeten afmaken.
<P>
Wanneer we eerlijk zijn - en voor mij is dat sinoniem met progressief -
moeten wij besluiten dat we niet passief mogen blijven toezien op de haast
onveranderlijke vernietiging van de bio-diversiteit; dat we niet mogen
aanvaarden dat &#233;&#233;n klasse, uit zuivere zelfbevrediging, voor het geldelijk
gewin, voor de macht, onze wereld vernietigt. Wij moeten die mensen, die
denken dat zij de wereld bezitten, tegenhouden. En ons enige wapen is de
redelijkheid. Wij kunnen de klasse van de zelfbevredigers slechts met het
woord te lijf gaan.
<P>
In die strijd kan het Esperanto een te duchten wapen zijn, want met het
Esperanto kunnen wij de grenzen doorbreken en aan de wereld tonen dat in
regio's progressieve Esperantosprekers actief zijn, die niet aanvaarden dat
wie dan ook, om welke reden dan ook het bezit van de aarde voor zich kan
opeisen. Door het Esperanto kunnen die ijveraars bij elkaar steun vinden;
weten dat zij in de wereld niet alleen staan, hoezeer dat door de
``internationale'' media ook wordt doodgezwegen.

Een delicaat politiek standpunt
</H2>
Onlangs vroeg een journalist me: ``Wat is het prototype van de esperantist?
Ik heb reeds verscheidene mensen ge&iuml;nterviewed, en zij blijken vooral uit
het onderwijs te komen. Zijn Esperantosprekers vooral leerkrachten?''
<P>
D&#233; esperantist bestaat natuurlijk niet. Wie de Esperantowereld grondig
analyseert, zal zien dat alle lagen van de bevolking elkaar daarin
ontmoeten: de professor naast de ongeschoolde, de industri&#235;le ondernemer
naast de arbeider. Binnen de Esperantowereld speelt dat onderscheid weinig
of geen rol: het zijn allemaal samideanoj, gelijkgezinden. Helaas, wanneer
zij terugkeren naar ``het werkelijke leven'', stapt iedereen opnieuw in zijn
eigen klasse. Ontmoeting is er wel, op daden moeten we vooralsnog wachten.
<P>
In de rubriek ``Minimaal'' van Het Laatste Nieuws (6 juni 1996) maakt de
redacteur zich vrolijk over het feit dat Jos&#233; Happart een plaats vindt op
de lijst van politici die hun steun aan het Esperanto hebben toegezegd. Nu
weet ik ook wel dat Happart in Vlaanderen moeilijk ligt, maar Vlaanderen is
Walloni&#235; niet, en Belgi&#235; is niet de wereld. De Esperantowereld is neutraal:
ook Happart is welkom, zelfs het Vlaams Blok is er welkom! Alleen, zij
moeten wel de idee&#235;n van het Esperanto onderschrijven. En daar ligt de
knoop, want hun eigen idee&#235;n en die van het Esperanto zullen al snel bij
henzelf met elkaar in conflict treden. Om in het reine te blijven met
zichzelf, zullen zij moeten kiezen: of de eigen idee&#235;n vaarwel zeggen en
echt esperantist worden, of het Esperanto verlaten.
<P>
Het Esperanto gaat de dialoog aan, niet alleen met de wereld, maar ook met
het <B>IK</B>. Daarom is het beeld van de esperantist in ``het werkelijke leven''
misschien ook dat van de idealistische, wereldvreemde dromer en
wereldverbeteraar. Alleen wie de laatste consequentie trekt, blijft. Het
Esperanto mag dan al neutraal zijn, de esperantist is dat zeker niet. Die
gelooft in basisdemocratie, gelijkheid - van taal maar ook in andere dingen
- en solidariteit. Dat tussen geloof en daad wetten staan en praktische
bezwaren, wie zal hem dat euvel duiden?

Interview uit de Antwerpenaar
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Internet nu echt internationaal</H2>
Sinds begin oktober van dit jaar heeft het Esperantocentrum, gevestigd aan
de Frankrijklei 140 te Antwerpen, een eigen homepage op het World Wide Web.
Op deze pagina kan je informatie krijgen over de internationale taal
Esperanto en esperantisten vinden hier o.a. teksten uit het maandblad MONATO
en links naar andere sites die voor hen in het bijzonder interessant kunnen
zijn.<P>

De directeur van het Esperantocentrum, Paul Peeraerts, is de bezieler van
deze homepage. De Antwerpenaar hield met hem een gesprek.<P>

De Antwerpenaar (DA): hoe is het idee ontstaan van een Esperanto-homepage?<P>

Paul Peeraerts (PP): Esperantisten over heel de wereld gebruiken Internet al
jaren om informatie uit te wisselen. Voor hen is dat een ideaal medium,
aangezien hun vrienden  vaak in andere landen of zelfs continenten wonen en
de post te traag is. Wij gebruikten tot voor kort een BBS om  de informatie
te verspreiden, maar dat was te duur voor onze buitenlandse en zelfs
binnenlandse leden, omdat de telefoonkosten te hoog opliepen. Toen Internet
vorig jaar betaalbaarder begon te worden dankzij de vele providers, was de
beslissing voor ons snel gemaakt: we moesten ons BBS ombouwen tot een
Internet-homepage. Alle informatie die vroeger via het BBS te krijgen was,
is nu op onze homepage te vinden, maar bovendien bieden wij zowel de
esperantisten als de ge&#239;nteresseerden de mogelijkheid om door een enkele
klik met de muis de weg te vinden naar niet minder dan vijftig andere
homepages die voor esperantisten nuttig kunnen zijn.<P>

DA: Is deze homepage Engelstalig?<P>

PP: Neen, wij hebben bewust gekozen om als werktalen ons te beperken tot het
Nederlands en het Esperanto. Ten eerste zou het te veel werk zijn om alle
informatie te vertalen. Ten tweede hebben wij ons als doel gesteld
informatie aan te bieden aan de Nederlandstalige ge&#239;nteresseerden en
aan de
actieve esperantisten. Voor de anderen bestaan er voldoende mogelijkheden op
het Internet.<P>

DA: Kan ik Esperanto leren via het Internet?<P>

PP: De homepage van de Vlaamse Esperantobond bevat teksten uit ons
maandelijks internationaal informatieblad "Monato" (nvdr.: dit is een soort
Newsweek) in het Esperanto, en daar kan je als gevorderd spreker natuurlijk
veel uit leren. Voor beginnelingen is er de cursus op het Internet, maar
daaraan hebben wij niet specifiek meegewerkt. Op onze homepage vind je
natuurlijk wel een link naar deze cursus en kan je gemakkelijk vinden waar
er in Vlaanderen en Nederland cursussen worden georganiseerd.<P>

DA: Klopt het dat Internet voor het Esperantocentrum in Antwerpen vooral
nuttig is, omdat teksten voor het internationale maandblad "Monato",
uitgegeven in Antwerpen, nu dankzij dit medium snel op de redactie kunnen
toekomen en eenvoudig doorgestuurd kunnen worden over heel de wereld naar
een netwerk van verbeteraars?<P>

PP: Dat klopt. Voor elk onderdeel van ons maandblad is er een specifieke
redacteur aangesteld. Als mensen die een bijdrage hebben, deze niet
onmiddellijk naar de juiste persoon sturen, zorgen wij ervoor. Vroeger was
dit een enorm tijdrovende bezigheid, omdat toen alles met de post opgestuurd
moest worden en vele teksten met de hand geschreven waren.<P>

DA: In hoeveel landen hebben jullie verbeteraars?<P>

PP: Nu zijn dat er zowat 12, maar we zoeken constant naar uitbreiding.<P>

DA: Denkt u dat de elektronische vorm van "Monato" een concurrent kan zijn
voor de geschreven versie?<P>

PP: In tegendeel! Op het scherm lezen is niet bepaald ideaal en
ge&#239;nteresseerden die misschien nog aarzelden om een abonnement te nemen
kunnen door Internet de smaak te pakken krijgen.<P>

DA: En waar kunnen onze lezers daarvoor terecht?<P>

PP: http://www.knooppunt.be/~fel<P>

DA: Dank u voor dit gesprek<P>

Grenzen aan veeltaligheid

<H2>
Grenzen aan veeltaligheid
</H2>
Op vrijdag 23 juni 1995 had in Brussel een colloquium plaats met als
thema ``Grenzen aan veeltaligheid? Taalgebruik en bestuurlijke
doeltreffendheid in de instellingen van de Europese Unie''. Het
colloquium werd georganiseerd door de Nederlandse Taalunie (NT) ten
einde eens een uitvoerig gesprek te hebben over de rol en de toekomst
van het Nederlands in de zich uitbreidende Europese Unie (EU).
<P>
Het was inderdaad duidelijk geworden dat dit thema eens ernstig door
Nederlandstaligen moest worden behandeld, vooral na het incident over
het taalgebruik in het Europees Merkenbureau (in 1994) en met het oog
op het doorlopend groeiend aantal talen in de EU, des te meer ten
gevolge van de regelmatig opduikende voorstellen om zich in de werking
van die Unie te beperken tot de ``grotere'' talen.
<P>
De Nederlandse Taalunie is ongetwijfeld de meest aangewezen instelling
om, ten behoeve van het Nederlands, zulk colloquium te organiseren. Ze
kon inzake de vergaderplaats geen betere keuze doen dan Brussel, in
feite de grootste stad van het Nederlandse taalgebied (zoals
&#233;&#233;n van
de sprekers, de Vlaamse essayist Geert van Istendael het terecht
onderstreepte) en meteen de belangrijkste zetel van die veeltalige
Europese Unie.
<P>
Die Nederlande Taalunie is bij velen van ons te weinig gekend. Het is
een intergouvernementele organisatie met secretariaat in Den Haag
(adres: Stadhoudersplantsoen 2, 2517 JL), die in 1980 is ontstaan door
een internationale conventie tussen Nederland en Belgi&#233; en waartoe in
principe ook andere landen, bv. Suriname, zouden kunnen toetreden. Zij
ijvert voor de eenheid, de bescherming, de ontplooiing en de
uitstraling van de Nederlandse taal en zij heeft een officieel
karakter.
<H3>
Esperanto en die veeltaligheid
</H3>
Een colloquium met zulk onderwerp is uiteraard niet alleen van belang
voor hen die de positie van het Nederlands verlangen te verdedigen.
Het is het evenzeer voor hen, die beseffen hoezeer de Europese Unie
sukkelt met een veeltaligheid die in de loop der jaren steeds
toegenomen is (en nog zal toenemen). Het is het nog meer voor hen die
betreuren dat er tot op heden zo weinig aandacht is besteed aan het
feit dat een groot aantal van die moeilijkheden kunnen worden
vereenvoudigd door een meer algemene kennis van een gemakkelijk
leerbare neutrale taal, die al sinds meer dan honderd jaar haar
deugdelijkheid heeft bewezen, het Esperanto.
<P>
Het nieuws over dit colloquium was het bestuur van de Vlaamse
Esperantobond slechts in de loop van juni ter ore gekomen en dat heeft
belet dat er binnen de VEB enige ruchtbaarheid aan werd gegeven. Toch
waren enkele kern figuren van de VEB op het colloquium aanwezig: Ivo
Durwael, voorzitter; Edward Symoens, ere-voorzitter; Wim De Smet,
vice-voorzitter; Christine Tytgat, taalkundige. Daarenboven waren ook
enkele leden op eigen initiatief gekomen: Hugo Rau, verbonden aan het
Vlaams Cultureel Centrum ``De Brakke Grond'' in Amsterdam en Karel van
Steenbergen, taalkundig cordinator bij de Europese Commissie. Uit
Nederland was Hans Erasmus, een drijvende kracht achter de Europese
Esperanto-Unie, overgekomen.
<P>
Zowel de algemene zitting als de aparte sessies zijn voor deze
VEB-deelnemers interessant geweest. In de sessie ``Taalverscheidenheid
en Democratie'' hebben Hans Erasmus en Wim De Smet de aandacht gevraagd
voor de mogelijkheden die het Esperanto biedt om in een veeltalige
kring beter de democratie te respecteren. Maar meest van al lag het
belang bij de gesprekken met andere deelnemers gedurende de
koffiepausen, het middagmaal en de receptie. Zo hebben we van
gedachten kunnen wisselen met personen als Marianne Thyssen van het
Europese Parlement, kamerlid Herman Candries en Vlaamse-raadslid
Gilbert Vanleenhove, Yvo Peeters van het Instituut voor Europese
Vorming en zovele anderen.
<P>
Jammer dat er die dag zulk uitermate belangrijk politiek agenda was in
de Vlaamse Raad, want anders zouden we veel meer politici en
gezagsdragers hebben ontmoet, zoals trouwens de deelnemerslijst het
had laten verwachten. De Vlaamse Regering was slechts even - namelijk
de tijd van zijn welkomstwoorden - vertegenwoordigd door haar nieuwe
cultuurminister, Luc Martens.
<P>
Wat wel opviel was dat, veel meer dan jaren geleden, er thans een
positievere instelling blijkt te bestaan ten opzichte van de
mogelijkheden die het Esperanto zou kunnen bieden. Zelfs personen, die
vroeger veeleer sceptisch stonden, zoals Marc Galle en Herman
Candries, kwamen deze keer gematigd positief over; Candries gaf ons
zelfs enige aanbevelingen om het Esperanto een betere rol te kunnen
laten spelen in het vertaalwerk. Verrassend positief was de
tussenkomst van de Vlaamse parlementair G. Vanleenhove, die als
sessievoorzitter de aanwezigen attent maakte op een aantal
verklaringen van Vlaamse en Waalse europarlementairen ten bate van het
Esperanto en zijn sympathie voor die oplossing geenszins verborg.
<P>
Ook in de slotrede van de Secretaris van de Taalunie, Mevr. Greet van
den Bergh, werd er tweemaal op gewezen dat volgens sommige deelnemers
een speciaal terzake ontworpen taal - een ``interlingua'' zoals zij het
uitdrukte - een nuttige rol zou kunnen spelen, en in die zin werd door
haar het Esperanto speciaal vermeld.
<H3>
Zovele andere onderwerpen
</H3>
Het colloquium zelf heeft trouwens veel stof gegeven voor
uiteenlopende meningen over o.a. de internationale druk waaraan het
Nederlands blootgesteld staat, de (on)doeltreffendheid van het vele
vertaalwerk, de democratische taalrechten van de Europese burgers en
vooral van hun vertegenwoordigers, de kosten van al dat vertaalwerk,
de nog steeds te grote kloof tussen Nederlanders en Vlamingen, onze
eigen instelling inzake het respect voor de moedertaal...
<P>
Apart intesssant was de uiteenzetting van prof. dr. T.J.M. van Els,
rector van de Universiteit van Nijmegen. Zijn stelling (die fel werd
aangevochten door anderen) is dat een taal als zodanig geen rechten
heeft; het zijn de gebruikers van de taal die de rechten hebben en die
desnoods die rechten kunnen of moeten laten gelden. Die gebruikers
kunnen echter ook gebruikers van een andere taal of van andere talen
worden en zij kunnen bijgevolg ook hun rechten inzake die andere taal
of talen laten gelden, b.v. een rendement verlangen voor de moeite en
de kosten die ze zich getroost hebben om die andere taal te leren.
Wanneer personen hun moedertaal of de taal van hun land of streek
verwaarlozen ten bate van een andere, dan is dat hun democratisch
recht, al kan natuurlijk de gemeenschap waarin ze leven daar anders
over oordelen en maatregelen nemen ter bevestiging van de plaatselijke
taal. Wat prof. T. van Els hier vooral voor ogen had, is de toestand
in sommige kringen in Nederland, waar het Engels thans opvallend
opgang maakt, net zoals vroeger bij ons het Frans een elitair
onderscheidingsmiddel was. - Maar zijn gedachtengang is interessant
inzake wat ooit zou kunnen gebeuren als gevolg van een verdere
verspreiding van de kennis van het Esperanto; tot op heden is daar nog
maar weinig aandacht aan besteed in de Esperantokringen zelf.
<P>
De hierboven vermelde uiteenzetting was slechts &#233;&#233;n
van de acht
lezingen, die in vier werkgroepen, op het programma stonden. Als
deelnemer moest men bijgevolg een keuze maken uit het aanbod. Maar
zelfs met die beperking was het programma een echte meevaller voor wie
in de thematiek genteresseerd was. Het is jammer dat zo weinigen van
ons de kans hebben te baat genomen om er aan deel te nemen.
<H3>
Slotbeschouwingen
</H3>
Laten we wel hopen dat de Nederlandse Taalunie, die als offici&#235;le
instelling de positie van het Nederlands moet verdedigen in een zich
uitbreidend Europa, meer en meer zal beseffen dat de beste verdediging
tegen een onrechtvaardige hegemonie van de zogezegde ''grote'' talen er
in kan bestaan het gebruik van een neutrale taal in de internationale
contacten tussen de burgers te bevorderen.
<P>
Een eerste aanzet in die richting is gegeven op dat colloquium van 23
juni 1995 met de offic&#235;le constatatie dat een aantal deelnemers het
gebruik van ``een interlingua'', meerbepaald het Esperanto, hiervoor
aanbevelen. Die mening is op dat colloquium door niemand betwist,
hoogstens is zij enigszins in vraag gesteld inzake de huidige
uitvoerbaarheid en wegens de grote onwetendheid van vele mensen inzake
deze taal.
<P>
Indien de Nederlandse Taalunie de positie van het Nederlands in de
veeltalige Europese Unie zal willen laten verdedigen, dan zal ze er
goed aan doen het niet te laten bij een vaststelling, maar doet ze
best de zaak eens grondiger te laten onderzoeken naar haar verdere
mogelijkheden.
<P>
Indien dat ooit zou gebeuren, dan zullen we er ons over kunnen
verheugen dat dit colloquium niet zo maar
&#233;&#233;n in de reeks is geweest,
maar dat het een weldaad kan worden voor de ganse mensheid.

<I>''Ik kom tot de conclusie, dat het probleem van een taal voor
internationale communicatie zich nu voordoet als het conflict
tussen een plantaal, Esperanto, waarvan men weet dat zij
bevredigend voor haar gebruikers functioneert, en een
overheersende nationale taal, die, zoals wij allen weten, op het
ogenblik het Engels is.''</I>
(Andr&#233; Martinet,
professor lingu&#239;stiek aan de Sorbonne-universiteit,
Parijs (1989))
<P>
Misschien kijken enkele lezers
van dit essay verbaasd of sceptisch op bij het vernemen
van de boven aangehaalde mening:
het Esperanto - dat vele mensen in hun geest verbinden
met een wazige en fundamenteel mislukte utopie - op &#233;&#233;
stellen met de Leviathan van een wereldtaal als het Engels, schijnt het
debat buiten de grenzen van het zinrijke te plaatsen.  En dat was
inderdaad het aanvaarde standpunt van de hoofdstromingen in het
Europese taaldebat van de afgelopen eeuw.  In dit essay probeer
ik aan te tonen waarom dat het geval was, hoe de factoren die in het spel
zijn zouden kunnen veranderen, en dat Martinet inderdaad
de vinger heeft gelegd op twee
polen van een zeer vruchtbaar debat over communicatie in een
tweede taal. Al dacht Martinet bij de
uiting van de bovenvermelde mening waarschijnlijk meer mondiaal
dan Europees, de hoofdvraag is in wezen dezelfde:  Wat
voor een rol speelt de rationaliteit in het doen en laten van de mensen, en
vooral, wat voor een relatie heeft zij tot de politieke,
culturele en psychische aspecten van een taal?  Dat zijn
uitgebreide onderwerpen, en hier zullen we ons beperken tot een
schets van het strijdtoneel tussen de David Esperanto en de Goliath
Engels.  Hopelijk zullen we enkele neergevallen stukken
van de over ons hoofd vliegende projectielen verzamelen die voor
ons van nut kunnen zijn.
<P>
Allereerst kan het nuttig zijn ons de feitelijke staat van het
Europese talenprobleem voor ogen te stellen.  Als zoveel erfgoed
uit een grijs verleden ontsnapt het Europese Babel dikwijls aan
een kritische aandacht: wij staan zelden stil om nageprate
beweringen over de continu&#239;teit van het Europese denken te
confronteren met realiteiten ter plaatse.  Volgens de heersende
mythe voltrekt de intellectuele uitwisseling zich voor werkers in
de hoofdstroom reeds eeuwen zonder problemen: maar wie kan
zeggen, wat voor latente contacten, wat voor opflakkeringen van
geestverwantschap verhinderd zijn door de Europese
talen-chaos?  Op het ogenblik gaat dit probleem niet meer slechts een
kleine, polyglotte elite aan.  Meer mensen dan ooit tevoren
komen, dank zij de ontwikkeling van de wetenschappelijke en
culturele samenwerking, van handel en reizen, gewild of ongewild in
contact zonder met elkaar te kunnen praten.  Een recente enqu&#234;te
heeft als resultaat opgeleverd dat ''het werkelijk juiste begrip
van het Engels [in West-Europa] aanzienlijk achterblijft bij
onze meest pessimistische verwachtingen'', omdat ze beperkt is tot
plus minus 6 % van de bevolking (Van de Sandt 1989). Andere talen
blijven daar vermoedelijk nog bij achter, en de cijfers voor
actieve taalbeheersing zouden nog lager zijn.  Wat betekent
gepraat over een zich verenigend Europa, zolang een
toevallige steekproef uit zijn bewoners, in &#233;&#233;n kamer
gezet, ternauwernood mag hopen het over iets eens te
worden, behalve misschien over de wenselijkheid de kamer meteen
te verlaten?
<P>
Aan de andere kant heeft de taalverscheidenheid natuurlijk enorme
rijkdommen meegebracht.  De halfzelfstandige ontwikkeling van
iedere nationale cultuur (waarin vele regionale en sociale aparte
vari&#235;teiten kunnen opbloeien) kan niet bestaan zonder de
beschermende taalmuur.  Daarom, en ook misschien omdat
meertaligheid een automatisch voordeel geeft aan goed opgeleide
mensen, zijn de voordelen van eentaligheid een impopulair
discussieonderwerp behalve onder hen, wier taal voor deze rol
wordt voorgesteld.  Ons onderwerp van een ''gemeenschappelijke
Europese taal'' kan dus niet gericht zijn op een gemeenschappelijke
<I>eerste</I> taal voor het continent, als we geen (anti-)utopische
verzinsels willen spinnen.  Men kan een leger van praktische,
ethische en politieke overwegingen bijeenbrengen om deze bewering
te ondersteunen (zie b.v. Hag&#232;ge 1986).
<P>
De voornaamste Europese politieke instellingen huldigen alle de
veeltaligheid. Alleen reeds in West-Europa hebben de Raad van Europa,
de Europese Commissie, het Europees Parlement en de
ministers van onderwijs van de lidstaten van de EG alle de
laatste jaren resoluties aanvaard ten gunste van de
''veeltaligheid'' en de intensivering van het onderwijs in de
talen van de Gemeenschap - natuurlijk ten koste van de talen
buiten de Gemeenschap.
<P>
Men zou er wel over kunnen discussi&#235;ren, of zelfs het relatief bescheiden
doel drie (van de negen) EG-talen aan alle burgers te onderwijzen,
bereikbaar of nastrevenswaardig is, als men de tot nu toe opgedane ervaringen
met het onderwijs in vreemde talen in aanmerking neemt (Chiti-Batelli 1988, blz. 57-91).  Toch blijft de meertaligheid de enige
voor alle EG-landen aanvaardbare politiek, en hetzelfde geldt
zeker voor Europa <I>in zijn geheel</I>.
Maar dat alles sluit het ontstaan van een gemeenschappelijke
tweede taal niet uit.  Inderdaad ziet men die gedachte als een draad lopen door
de geschiedenis van Europa sinds de Verlichting
(Large 1985, blz. 43-63).  Daarachter liggen de schimmen van het
Romeinse Keizerrijk en de middeleeuwse kerk, verblekende oude
teksten die verwijzen naar een verlorengegane (en gedeeltelijk
denkbeeldige) taaleenheid; en later, de dromen over een taal van
universele verstandhouding (Knowlson 1975).  Maar dat waren
slechts schimmen en dromen: andere, minder duidelijk aanwijsbare
krachten verenigen en vormen nu het continent, en daarvoor betekenen
de antieke legertaal, die een communicatiemiddel van liturgie en
geestelijkheid werd, of de tastende lingu&#239;stische onderzoeken
van Wilkins en zijn geestverwanten maar weinig.
<P>
Inderdaad is het niet zeker, wat voor een proces de Europese
eenwording is, en welke gevolgen ze voor de taalpolitiek zal
hebben.  Pragmatische economische motieven (die op zichzelf de
neiging tot eentaligheid begunstigen) liggen naast
internationalisme en ''Euronationalisme''. Dat wordt op zijn beurt
ge&#239;nspireerd door romantische visioenen over vergane
glorie, isolationistische hunkering naar een herdefinitie van
zichzelf, of een neokolonialistisch streven naar een groter stuk
van de wereldtaart. Zelfs een beschermende legitimatie binnen de EG zou voor
sommige staten het doel kunnen zijn in het aangezicht van interne
versplintering (men denkt bv. aan Spanje en Cataloni&#235;). En op zichzelf
de geografische definitie van Europa blijft onduidelijk, met alle
gevolgen daarvan voor de aanvaardbaarheid van gemeenschappelijke
werktalen en de uitvoerbaarheid van een taalgelijkheid van het
type van de EG (reeds nu, met negen talen, aan de rand van
ineenstorting).  Dus begint onze beschouwing van de kandidaten
voor de positie van Europese internationale taal met een
voorwaarde inzake de definitie van Europa zelf.  De eisen aan een
dergelijke taal zullen in ieder geval door de sociale en
politieke situatie worden bepaald: een eventueel Europa van 30 landen heeft
andere oplossingen nodig dan een Europa van twaalf; een Europa
van 80 landen weer andere.
<P>
Twee lingu&#239;stische overwegingen dragen mee bij tot het defini&#235;ren van het probleem,
beide inzake de ''diepte'' van een gemeenschappelijke Europese taal.
Ten eerste, wat zullen zijn sociale functies zijn?  Als we
aanvaarden dat maar weinig Europeanen de verdwijning wensen van de
verscheidenheid van talen, dan zal er een taakverdeling
tussen de internationale taal en de lokale taal moeten bestaan.
Het schijnt even onaanvaardbaar dat een dergelijke taal beperkt
blijft tot een bepaalde klasse of groep van beroepen, een soort
''Euro-elite'' (hoewel juist dat in de praktijk gelegitimeerd wordt
door de huidige politiek van meertaligheid).  Tenslotte zijn de
banden tussen taal en cultuur zo nauw, dat het nutteloos is te
denken aan een ''alleen'' voor de uitwisseling van informatie
gebruikte taal.  Als deze eisen voor een bepaalde taal onderling
onverenigbaar schijnen, moeten wij ons afvragen, of die
taal inderdaad als een stabiele verkeerstaal zou kunnen
functioneren.
<P>
De andere, daarmee samenhangende, factor betreft de leerbaarheid
van de taal, als we aanvaarden, dat zij een tweede, niet de
moedertaal, zal moeten zijn (als we dus de tweetaligheid vanaf de
geboorte buiten beschouwing laten, als behorend tot een nog
verdere toekomst).  Wij zullen allereerst moeten bedenken, dat de
interne ontwikkeling van afzonderlijke taalgemeenschappen
verrassend uiteenloopt, zelfs binnen de betrekkelijk beperkte
scala van hier behandelde talen.  Het soms bijna fanatieke
purisme van het Frans staat in fel contrast tot de zorgeloze
woordenimport van zijn noorderbuur, het Nederlands; het
hardnekkige verzet van het Britse Engels tegen hervorming van
spelling of grammatica vormt een tegenpool tot de consequente
aanpassing van het Spaans of het Estisch.  Het Tsjechisch, diep
in het hart van Europa, heeft een unieke graad van ongelijkheid
tussen zijn gesproken en geschreven vorm.  We zouden de zaak nog
uitvoeriger kunnen behandelen, maar het moet reeds duidelijk
zijn, dat Europa op het niveau van de volkstaal geenszins &#233;&#233;n
taaltraditie bezit.  Goed opgeleide specialisten kunnen zich
natuurlijk tot op zekere hoogte losmaken van de gedurende het
leren van hun moedertaal ingeplante onderbewuste
vooronderstellingen.  Maar de meerderheid van de gebruikers van
een gemeenschappelijke tweede taal zou geen enkele op dat doel gerichte training
hebben: voor hen zou de verkeerstaal een gevoel van vreemdheid,
zelfs van onjuistheid dreigen
mee te brengen, en hen bedriegen in hun verwachtingen volgens
de volkstaalkunde.
<P>
Hier stuiten wij in feite op het probleem van de onoverkomelijke
verschillen tussen talen, dat George Steiner centraal
stelde in zijn studie over
(voornamelijk Europese) vertaling <I>After Babel</I>
(1975).  Zulke verschillen maken natuurlijk het leren van een
tweede taal niet onmogelijk, zelfs tot een niveau dat
karakteristiek is voor iemand die de taal tot moedertaal heeft.
Maar die beperken wel ernstig wat men kan bereiken zonder een
volledige onderdompeling in de desbetreffende taalgemeenschap.
Steiner zegt over ''technisch bekwame'' Japanners die Engels
leren: ''Ze praten zo correct maar treffen zo zelden de juiste toon'' (1975, blz. 470).
We moeten vragen welke graad van ''juistheid'' bereikbaar is, en
welke nodig, in een Europese taal voor die mensen die ze niet als
moedertaal spreken.
<P>
Het doel van de bovenstaande overwegingen is aan te tonen, dat,
als we het probleem van een gemeenschappelijke Europese taal
ernstig willen behandelen, wij bereid moeten zijn het maximum te
eisen.  Zij moet mondeling en schriftelijk bevredigend
functioneren, een voldoende vrije deelneming openstellen voor
alle Europeanen (hoe ook gedefinieerd), en de hele scala van het
Europese denken kunnen uitdrukken op een door haar sprekers als
adequaat gevoelde manier.  Een taal die die voorwaarden slechts
gedeeltelijk vervult, is slechts ''een'' Europese taal, groot of
klein naargelang van het aantal gebruikers, maar bezit geen unieke
status.
<P>
Het grootste deel van dit essay bestaat in een onderzoek van de
mate, waarin het Engels en het Esperanto, elk aan hun pool, aan
deze eisen beantwoorden.  De eerste is een niet gesystematiseerde etnische
taal, gesproken als moedertaal door meer dan 300 miljoen mensen,
inclusief meer dan 50 miljoen in Europa zelf; haar
kwalificaties berusten grotendeels op de huidige werkelijkheid en
op de aantrekkingskracht van de economische realiteiten. De
tweede heeft zich in een eeuw van beperkt maar internationaal
gebruik ontwikkeld van een relatief strikt systematisch fundament tot
een levend tussenmenselijk communicatiemiddel van een
''vrijwillige, niet etnische, niet-territoriale taalgemeenschap''
(Wood 1979). Ze heeft haar basis grotendeels in Europa en wordt door
een statistisch te verwaarlozen percentage als moedertaal
gesproken. Ik zou niet zeggen, dat die twee talen de
enige denkbare kandidaten voor de functie van gemeenschappelijke
Europese taal zijn, alleen dat ze de scala van in aanmerking
komende oplossingen adequaat afbakenen.
<P>
Het Engels is tegenwoordig naar de algemene mening de sterkste
kandidaat voor de positie van een, hetzij in Europa, hetzij
elders, bijna overal bruikbare taal. Het tussenzinnentje van Martinet,
''zoals wij allen weten'', doet de onbetwistheid van deze
veronderstelling voelen.  Het Britse en Amerikaanse kolonialisme
en hun economische imperia zijn erin geslaagd de taal naar de
vier hoeken van de aarde te brengen; haar positie schoot vooral
wortel door de technologische dynamiek van de Verenigde Staten,
die garandeert dat men daardoor toegang krijgt tot een enorme
markt en een uitgebreide scala van informatie.  Sinds het begin
van deze eeuw is de internationale hegemonie van het Engels
steeds duidelijker geworden, in die mate, dat sommige van haar
sprekers, zowel wie het als moedertaal spreekt als als
vreemde taal, voorspellen dat het wortel zal schieten als
een werkelijk universele taal.
<P>
Op die mogelijkheid hebben de intellectuelen verschillend
gereageerd.  Een sterke stroming in het socialisme juichte
reeds zeer vroeg de verbreiding van enkele Europese talen toe, als
een bijdrage tot de integratie van de wereldsamenleving (Lins
1987).  Zelfs conservatieven die zorgzaam omgingen met hun eigen nationale cultuur en identiteit
hebben zich toch dikwijls tenminste
gedeeltelijk ge&#239;dentificeerd met de commerci&#235;le en koloniserende
krachten achter het Engels, zoals ze vroeger bereidwillig het
Frans als het dominerende communicatiemiddel van de Europese
beschaving en de internationale diplomatie aanvaardden.  Men ontmoet nog vaak
verdedigers van die meningen, gewoonlijk onder de banier van de
expliciete eentaligheid.
<P>
Maar dergelijke meningen raken steeds meer in tegenspraak met het
moderne besef van de wezenlijke rol van de taal in het leven van de mens.
E&#233;n van de tradities die die wijze van denken verwerpen, stamt van de lingu&#239;sten
zelf, vooral van de veldwerkers.  Typisch is het volgende
klaaglied van een kronikeur van de niet-Engelse talen in
Brittanni&#235;: ''De enige die door het Engels niet beroerd zijn,
zijn het Pictisch en het Keltisch-Pictisch, die in
Noord-Schotland uitstierven voordat het Engels tot die talen doordrong.
Want het Engels is een moordenaar.  Het Engels heeft het
Cumbrisch, het Cornwelsh, het Nornisch en de Manx-taal
uitgeroeid. Het Engels heeft het Iers nu volledig vervangen als
eerste taal in Noord-Ierland. En het Engels vormt zo'n grote
bedreiging voor het Welsh en het Gaelisch, en voor het Frans op
de Normandische Eilanden, dat op de lange duur hun voortbestaan
zeer twijfelachtig schijnt...  Men kan alleen, hoewel
vruchteloos, trachten te gissen, of de Britse Eilanden zich na
honderd jaar, tot onschatbare schade voor zichzelf, zullen
onderwerpen (want het woord ''bereiken'' is hier misplaatst) aan
een sinds het begin van hun geboekstaafde geschiedenis ongekende,
weinig benijdenswaardige taaleenheid. (Price 1984, blz. 170 en
blz. 241).  Hoewel de toestand in Europa nog niet zo ver
gevorderd is, zouden misschien velen dezelfde woorden spreken in
het vooruitzicht van een zich vestigende hegemonie van het Engels.
<P>
De verheffing van het nationalisme tot heersende ideologie voor
meer dan 160 onafhankelijke staten heeft zijn consequenties.  In
1945 konden de Verenigde Naties bij hun geboorte hun offici&#235;le
talen niet beperken tot twee - het Engels en het Frans -, zoals
de Volkenbond dat wel kon.  In 1965 bij de stichting
van de Europese Gemeenschap, voelde men reeds een behoefte de
talen van alle lidstaten gelijkheid onder het Europese Handvest te
garanderen, al was het van het begin af duidelijk, dat in de
dagelijkse leiding van Gemeenschapszaken sommige talen ''gelijker dan andere'' zouden zijn.  En nu nog worden de Verenigde
Naties geconfronteerd met een voortdurende druk van in de huidige
regeling niet opgenomen grote taalgemeenschappen. Twee
lidstaten van de EG, Ierland en Luxemburg, moesten beloven niet
aan te dringen op een behandeling op voet van gelijkheid van hun
kleine offici&#235;le talen.
<P>
Maar politieke verklaringen hebben niet altijd veel invloed op
het dagelijkse leven.  Het is zeer moeilijk betrouwbare
statistieken over het gebruik van het Engels als tweede taal,
hetzij in Europa, hetzij elders, te vinden: dat stuit op de
karakteristieke ongrijpbaarheid van communicatie in taal en de
moeilijkheid de juiste criteria voor gegevens te kiezen.  Maar
het is buiten twijfel, dat het Engels geldt als een prestigieuze,
veelgebruikte taal, waarvan het leren onmiddellijk profijt
afwerpt.  99 percent van de Nederlandse abituri&#235;nten heeft het Engels
als hun voornaamste vreemde taal geleerd; de cijfers in andere
Europese landen, hoewel lager, zijn toch hoger dan die voor enige
andere taal.  Enige beheersing van het Engels, tenminste
schriftelijk, is vereist in vele beroepen, vooral in de
natuurwetenschappen.  Toch overdreef misschien George Steiner,
toen hij beweerde dat het Engels ''voor mannen en vrouwen in de
hele wereld, vooral voor de jongeren, het gevoel van hoop, van
materi&#235;le vooruitgang, van wetenschappelijke en empirische
procedures schijnt te belichamen'' (1975, blz. 468).  Vermoedelijk zien
de meeste jonge Europeanen het
Engels meer als de taal van MacDonald's en Hollywood, van
snelle en relatief goedkope bevrediging zonder veel achtergrond.
De beweerde gemakkelijkheid van het Engels, die, zoals
iedere leraar van vreemde talen zal getuigen, slechts kenmerkend
is voor de meest elementaire lagen van de taal zonder
werkwoordstijden en idioom, moet zelf, als ze al iets uitricht,
die houding versterken.  Steiner zelf spreekt over ''een dunne,
wonderlijk vloeiende laag, maar zonder deugdelijk fundament''
(1975, blz. 470).
<P>
Voor een verhelderend perspectief op dit gebrek aan ''fundament''
kunnen we ons wenden tot een andere polyglotte lingu&#239;st in een
land waar het Engels reeds de positie van nationale verkeerstaal
verworven heeft.  Dasgupta (Dasgupta 1988) geeft stof tot
nadenken in zijn schets van enkele mogelijke oorzaken van de
verschillen in creativiteit tussen het Sanskriet op zijn hoogtepunt,
tussen ongeveer 500 en 1000 na Christus, en het Indische Engels
tegenwoordig.  De grote Sanskrietschrijvers werkten in een tijd,
toen hun taal door niemand in India meer als moedertaal gesproken
werd en slechts als geleerd, ''kunstmatig'' communicatiemiddel
bestond.  Het tegenwoordige Engels daarentegen blijft gebonden
aan een ''naturalistische'' volkslingu&#239;stiek, belichaamd in 300
miljoen mensen in alle werelddelen die het als moedertaal
spreken. Dasgupta betoogt, dat de twee- of drietalige Indische
spreker van het Engels die taal niet als ''natuurlijk'' kan voelen. Als men
Engels spreekt doet men een te bewuste, te re&#235;le keus,
hoe vloeiend men ook spreekt en hoe de technische details van
het hanteren van de taal ook zijn. Het gevolg is een gebrek aan
scheppingskracht: ''Terwijl het Engels in India heerst, blijft
het Indische Engels onwettig in de Engelstalige wereld: deze
internationale ambigu&#239;teit ... garandeert, dat de door Rajeev
Patke in zijn artikel beschreven problemen - d.w.z. het
ontbreken van eersterangs creatief Engelstalig werk in India - nog
lang zullen voortduren (Dasgupta 1988, blz. 25).
<P>
Terwijl deze opmerking speciaal het Indische voorbeeld betreft,
raakt ze een veel algemener probleem dat we al eerder aangestipt
hebben.  Iedere samenleving die zijn eigen cultuur in een andere
taal dan het Engels uitdrukt, krijgt te maken met een functionele
taakverdeling tussen de verkeerstaal en de inheemse taal.  De
ervaringen doen reeds vermoeden, dat het Engels daardoor niet alleen
kan worden afgesneden van de inheemse wortels van creativiteit, maar het ook kan
destabiliseren.  In de laatste jaren voltrok zich een geheel
onverwachte taalrevolutie op de Filippijnen, waar de
prestigieuze openbare rol van het Engels plotseling werd
overgenomen door het Tagalog (Branegan 1989).  Men kan zich
gemakkelijk een soortgelijke omwenteling in andere
ontwikkelingslanden voorstellen, ten gevolge van een
herbevestiging van de nationale identiteit, eventueel zelfs met
een wereldwijde vermindering van de betekenis van het Engels.
<P>
De betekenis van dit alles voor de Europese situatie is geenszins
marginaal.  Het Engels is toch in feite de taal van een Europese
natie, en men kan dus betogen, dat haar semantiek, zelfs haar
grammatica dichter staan bij de gemeenschappelijke culturele norm
in Europa dan in India en de Filippijnen.  Maar haar
geografische en lingu&#239;stische basis blijft perifeer.  De landen
die het Engels met het meeste succes in het dagelijkse leven
hebben ge&#239;ntegreerd zijn de buurlanden: Ierland (eigenlijk met
te groot succes, als men zich zorgen maakt over de inheemse
taal), Nederland, Zweden en de andere Scandinavische landen.
Duitsland blijft achter; de Fransen zijn of onverschillig of
verzetten zich hardnekkig.  Buiten Noord-Europa is de positie van
het Engels niet sterker dan in vele andere delen van de wereld: het is
een belangrijke taal, maar plaatselijke culturele en politieke
relaties wegen dikwijls zwaarder, zelfs bij het meertalige deel
van de bevolking.
<P>
En wat is de status van het Engels in die landen, waar het
algemeen als tweede taal aanvaard is?  De bezoeker van Nederland
wordt zich weldra bewust van de druk van het Engels op het
dagelijkse leven: de televisie, radio en pers brengen het in
ieder huis en in de schoolpleingesprekken van kinderen;
reclamemakers gebruiken het om hun boodschap te kruiden,
journalisten nemen er hun toevlucht toe als ze de Nederlandse
woorden niet kunnen vinden.  Zo nu en dan kan men de extreme
mening vernemen, dat het Nederlands binnen twee generaties de rol
van nationale taal aan het Engels zal prijsgeven.  Maar voor een
Engelstalige waarnemer van buiten lijkt dit alles oppervlakkig.
De Nederlanders beheersen het Engels veel meer passief dan
actief, om films en teksten te begrijpen, niet om ze voort te
brengen.  Om dezelfde reden blijft het Engels volgens Steiner
''een dunne laag''.  De Nederlandse muziekgroepen treden vaak op
met Engelse teksten
maar Nederlandse acteurs slechts zelden en
Nederlandse schrijvers (natuurlijk!) nooit.  De verkoop van een
Nederlandse vertaling van een Engels origineel overtreft verre die
van het origineel zelf.
<P>
Dit alles ondersteunt sterk de opvatting om de stelling van
Dasgupta over creativiteit in een tweede taal uit te breiden tot de Europese
situatie. Het herinnert ons er tevens aan, dat er over de huidige
positie van het Engels niets vaststaat.  Een taal moet telkens
weer geleerd worden van geslacht tot geslacht om haar plaats te
behouden: culturele, economische of politieke ontwikkelingen kunnen
snel leiden tot verrassende veranderingen.  De positie in Europa
van het Latijn en later van het Frans leken destijds ongetwijfeld
onaantastbaar.  Het Engels heeft nu anderhalve eeuw het getij
mee, maar de statistieken over het werkelijke gebruik ervan in Europa,
volgens de boven geciteerde studie, zijn werkelijk niet zeer
indrukwekkend (Van de Sandt 1989).  In dit licht lijkt het
mislukken van de poging van het pan-europese Engelstalige
televisienet <I>Sky Channel</I> om een belangrijk deel van de Europese
markt te veroveren, niet een incident maar onvermijdelijk.  De rol
van het Engels in het Europese bewustzijn is niet die van een
normale volkstaal, maar van een noodzakelijk communicatiemiddel
in welgedefinieerde situaties.  De mensen die aan internationale
conferenties hebben deelgenomen herkennen zonder moeite het
verschijnsel, dat na een lezing zich levendig pratende nationale
groepjes vormen, terwijl men een paar minuten eerder in adequaat
maar formeel Engels discussieerde.
<P>
Als politieke, culturele en psychische obstakels de
mogelijkheden beperken, dat het Engels ooit de overkoepelende taal
van Europa zal worden, en als we niet een geheel onvoorzienbaar
identiteitsverlies van de verschillende Europese volken
veronderstellen, dan is het ogenblik gekomen om het alternatief
dat zijn tegenpool biedt, te onderzoeken.  Het Esperanto wordt
geconfronteerd met moeilijkheden die in veel opzichten het
spiegelbeeld zijn van die van het Engels. Het is leerzaam
beide te vergelijken.  Het zou vervelend zijn en, naar ik hoop,
is het ook onnodig hier de argumentatie te herhalen voor de stelling, dat men het
Esperanto moet beschouwen als een normaal functionerende taal met
een buitengewone sociale basis.  Er zijn over dat onderwerp vele
studies beschikbaar; voor de ge&#239;nteresseerde lezer wordt een
goede ori&#235;ntatie gegeven door de artikels en geciteerde bronnen
in een recente toevoeging aan de serie <I>Trends in Linguistics</I>
(Schubert (red.), 1989).  Hier concentreer ik me op de
aspecten, die het huidige onderwerp rechtstreeks raken.
Onafhankelijk van de kansen op succes van het Esperanto, hebben,
naar het mij toeschijnt, de te behandelen idee&#235;n onmiddellijk en
sterk met de hele problematiek te maken.
<P>
Terwijl de kandidatuur van het Engels pragmatisch een beroep doet op
zijn huidige positie en zich ternauwernood met lingu&#239;stische
middelen rechtvaardigt, baseert het Esperanto zijn argumenten op
principi&#235;le vragen.  Zijn twee klassieke hoofdstellinen roepen het
hoopvolle rationalisme van de Verlichting weer op, en zijn
dikwijls en op vele manieren tot uitdrukking gebracht in de
honderdjarige geschiedenis van de beweging.  Een plantaal is
reeds door zijn aard gemakkelijker te leren dan een niet geplande
taal; de aanspraken voor het Esperanto schommelen tussen een
kwart en een twintigste van de tijd nodig om een ''natuurlijke''
taal op een gelijkwaardig niveau te leren beheersen (Sherwood en
Chang 1980).  En een plantaal biedt, aangenomen dat zij werkelijk
autonoom functioneert en zich ontwikkelt,
het politieke voordeel van neutraliteit.  Wij
zullen die aanspraken en hun consequenties zo meteen onderzoeken.
<P>
Maar het eerste belangrijke punt waarop men moet letten is de
geheel verschillende terreinen waarop de twee talen hun strijd verkiezen te
voeren. Het Esperanto kan inderdaad materieel niet concurreren
met de gigantische industrie van ''het Engels als tweede taal''.
De grootste Esperanto-organisatie ter wereld, de <I>Universala
Esperanto-Asocio</I>,
heeft minder dan 50000 leden en het is
onwaarschijnlijk dat meer dan tien keer dit aantal de taal actief
spreekt. Het totale aantal uitgaven per jaar bedraagt 250, het
aantal belangrijke periodieken is ongeveer de helft daarvan.
Het is niet juist te menen dat die cijfers verwaarloosbaar zijn, want het
spreken van Esperanto verkiest men geheel vrijwillig, bijna
zonder enige materi&#235;le prikkel. Hoeveel mensen zouden naar
verwachting Engels als tweede taal spreken onder dergelijke
omstandigheden?  Maar ze betekenen wel dat de verdedigers van het
Esperanto gedwongen worden hun argumenten te baseren op
mogelijkheden in plaats van op harde feiten, een boodschap die
onvermijdelijk slechts een beperkt publiek bereikt (zie bv.
Large 1985, blz. 197-201).
<P>
Er zijn nog andere, subtielere redenen, waarom het Esperanto meer
dan een eeuw buiten de hoofdstroom van de Europese culturele
discussie is gebleven, ondanks een uitzonderlijk goede culturele
en intellectuele basis.  Claude Piron, psycholoog in Gen&#232;ve en
&#233;&#233;n van de voornaamste tegenwoordige ideologen van de beweging,
betoogt dat het Esperanto bij vele voorstanders van het gebruik
van &#233;&#233;n taal een diepe onbewuste
vrees oproept: ''Als men de psychologische reacties, die het
woord ,Esperanto' oproept, onderzoekt, kan men zich slechts
verwonderen over het aantal mensen die de gedachte niet kunnen
verdragen, dat die taal
in sommige opzichten superieur kan zijn aan hun moedertaal.''  Die reactie komt voort uit een neiging een taal met
zichzelf te vereenzelvigen: ''mijn taal is mijn volk, mijn taal
ben ik; als mijn taal inferieur is, is mijn volk inferieur, en
ben ik inferieur.'' (1988, blz. 9).  De verdere opmerking van
Piron, ''dat de taalrelaties altijd relaties van een machtige tot
een zwakke zijn geweest'', is een echo van de onafhankelijke
onderzoekingen van de Duitse historicus Ulrich Lins, die onlangs
een degelijk gedocumenteerde studie publiceerde over de
verdenkingen, tegenwerking en bewuste vervolgingen van de
Esperantobeweging door vele totalitaire regimes, vooral
in het Duitse Derde Rijk en in de Sovjetunie
onder Stalin.  Lins ziet soortgelijke processen zich ook nu
voltrekken, hoewel in een minder drastische vorm: ''Vele regeringen schijnen niet te willen, dat het Esperanto zijn
mogelijkheden ten volle verwezenlijkt, want hoewel ze zich met de
mond uitspreken voor internationale communicatie, willen ze de
voorwaarden waaronder hun burgers grensoverschrijdende contacten
kunnen genieten, blijven bepalen.  Men kan het als een vooruitgang
beschouwen, dat in de laatste tijd ''het recht tot communicatie''
aan de lijst van mensenrechten is toegevoegd...  Aan de andere
kant zal Unesco het niet wagen de nationale regeringen te
beledigen door verklaringen af te leggen over het taal-aspect van de
internationale communicatie, tenzij dan in zeer algemene termen.''
(1988, blz. 531).
<P>
Als we nu de motieven buiten beschouwing laten, zijn de
fundamentele pretenties van het Esperanto bij Europese
intellectuelen niet onaangevochten gebleven.  Al trekken slechts
weinigen van hen de relatieve gemakkelijkheid van het Esperanto
in twijfel, toch hebben vele schrijvers als I. A. Richards en
George Steiner de verdenking geuit, dat dit schijnbare voordeel
verzwakt door ''het gebrek aan uitdrukkingsvermogen van iedere plantaal''.  Enigszins vereenvoudigd
komt hun beschuldiging neer op een ontkenning van de werkelijke
autonomie van de taal, die slechts ''tijd en een eigen gebied''
kunnen geven (Steiner 1975, blz. 470).  Dergelijke schrijvers
missen in de regel eerstehands kennis van de lexicografie
en literatuur van het Esperanto en zelfs maar de geringste ervaring met de
gesproken taal (Verloren van Themaat, 1989).  Hun argumenten, hoe
coherent en goed ogent ook, worden gelogenstraft door de
realiteit.  Een verrassend maar controleerbaar feit van de
interlingu&#239;stiek is, dat de nu aanvaarde betekenissen of
bijbetekenissen van een Esperantowoord of het genuanceerde gebruik van
een morfeem dikwijls verschilt van wat men kan aantreffen
in het gezaghebbende eentalige woordenboek van de taal of in het
gebruik van haar vroegste sprekers (Piron 1989).  Bovendien
hebben ontwikkelde sprekers van het Esperanto tenminste een
oppervlakkige kennis van de hoofdwerken van de originele en
vertaalde literatuur en van de hoofdzaken van de geschiedenis van
de taal: een kennis overgedragen door formele middelen
(examens), halfformeel (seminaria en populariserende werken) en
persoonlijke contacten.  Op die manier wordt de autonome lexicale
en culturele kern bewaard, waarschijnlijk hechter dan die van
vele grotere maar minder ontwikkelde taalgemeenschappen in de
hele wereld.  Inderdaad voltrekken zich aan de periferie van de
taal ongetwijfeld interferenties door contacten met de etnische
moedertaal van de sprekers.  Die interferenties verdwijnen echter
zonder uitzondering, wanneer de onderwerpen of de sprekers zelf
dichter bij het centrum van de internationale cultuur komen.  Er
schijnt in beginsel geen reden te zijn, waarom hetzelfde
verschijnsel zich niet op veel grotere schaal zou voordoen, als
het Esperanto als voornaamste internationale communicatiemiddel
aanvaard zal worden, in Europa of elders.
<P>
Het kan lijken dat het bestaan van deze onafhankelijke
culturele basis, of ''semantiek'', tenminste gedeeltelijk de tweede
pretentie van het Esperanto, haar culturele neutraliteit,
logenstraft.  Inderdaad wordt vaker de kritiek gehoord, dat haar
in hoofdzaak Romaans vocabularium en Europese sociale basis het
Esperanto diskwalificeren voor de rol van wereldtaal.  Als deze
beschuldiging juist was, zou ze zelfs toegevoegd kunnen worden
aan de argumenten voor het Europese gebruik van het Esperanto:
talen verenigen niet alleen, maar geven ook een identiteit.
Een door de rest van de wereld verworpen gemeenschappelijke
Europese taal zou binnen de grenzen van het werelddeel een
grotere aantrekkingskracht en dynamiek kunnen winnen.  Maar het
Esperanto is, zelfs als men dat zou betreuren, veel meer een
wereldwijd dan een zuiver Europees communicatiemiddel.  Daartoe
dragen vele van haar aspecten bij, waarvan de interpretatie
binnen de beweging zelf omstreden is en blijft.
<P>
Lexicaal en historisch is het Esperanto zonder twijfel Europees.
Het is immers te betwijfelen, of een ander werelddeel
onafhankelijk het begrip van een internationale plantaal
ontwikkeld heeft. Bovendien is ieder dergelijk aposteriorisch project
dat over de hele wereld aanvaard wil worden, gedwongen zich
grotendeels op Indo-Europese wortels te baseren (de Indo-Europese
volken maken reeds ongeveer de helft van de wereldbevolking uit).
Maar aan de taalkundige kant wordt dat Europese karakter in
evenwicht gehouden door een aprioristische syntactische
morfologie, zonder enige analogie onder de Indo-Europese talen,
en aan de culturele kant wordt het gecompenseerd door een
universalistische ideologische basis. Deze twee aspecten werken
inderdaad op een fascinerende manier op elkaar in.  In brede
kringen is reeds de mening aanvaard, dat het basislexicon van het
Esperanto zo beperkt mogelijk zou moeten zijn binnen de grenzen
van duidelijkheid en uitdrukkingsvermogen, en dat de
mogelijkheden tot woordvorming van de taal zo veel mogelijk gebruikt
moeten worden.  Deze meningen worden meestal verbonden met het
beginsel van ''eenvoud'' of leergemak, en dikwijls met een
expliciet pleidooi voor de veronderstelde behoeften van
niet-Europese sprekers, voor wie het vocabularium een groter obstakel
uitmaakt dan voor de meeste Europeanen.
<P>
Dat wil niet zeggen, dat de tegengestelde denkrichting onder de
Esperantosprekers niet vanaf het begin aanwezig is geweest.
Polemieken over ''neologismen'' - soms werkelijk nieuwe woorden, maar
vaker zeldzame, stilistisch gemarkeerde woorden waarvoor een
''eenvoudig'' alternatief bestaat - riepen hartstochten op
gedurende de gehele geschiedenis van de beweging.  Een
belangrijke prescriptivische school, die baanbrekende studies
over de woordvorming en de zinsbouw in het Esperanto voortbracht
(Schubert 1989, blz. 257-265), slaagde erin de Europese normen
van de taal te codificeren in radicale afwijking van de
Proteusachtige Fundamentele Grammatica.  Maar het effect bleek
minimaal en vluchtig (Wood 1987).  De taal heeft niet alleen zijn
niet-Europese trekken bewaard, maar de retoriek van de
belangrijkste organisaties en personen in de beweging is
hardnekkig mondiaal gebleven.  Een verlevendiging in de laatste
tijd van de activiteit buiten Europa, met inbegrip van wereldcongressen
in Brazili&#235; en China, heeft die tendens versterkt.
De beschikbare inlichtingen doen vermoeden, dat de grote meerderheid
van de Esperantosprekers hun taal als een wereldtaal beschouwt.
Vanuit hun gezichtspunt maakt een eventuele bijdrage van het
Esperanto tot de oplossing van taalproblemen in Europa, hoewel
belangrijk, slechts &#233;&#233;n stap tot het einddoel uit.  Het is niet
duidelijk, of een dergelijke ideologie de aanvaarding van het
Esperanto in Europa zelf vergemakkelijkt of bemoeilijkt.
<P>
Als laatste punt inzake de neutraliteit moeten we opmerken dat het
Esperanto niet lijdt aan Dasgupta's paradox inzake creativiteit
in een tweede taal.  Anders dan het Engels, waarvan de normen
vastgesteld worden door de mensen die het als moedertaal spreken,
ontleent het Esperanto zijn (in elk geval minder starre) regels
aan de internationale communicatie: daartoe kan iedere spreker
uit ieder land bijdragen.  Dat is ongetwijfeld &#233;&#233;n van de
oorzaken van de affectieve band, die zoveel van zijn sprekers met
de taal aanknopen.  Een rol speelt ook het feit, dat zijn
flexibele structuur werkelijk buitengewoon geschikt voor creatief
gebruik is gebleken (Piron 1987, 1989).  Maar de praktische
zwakten van een dergelijke gemeenschap zijn duidelijk.  Het
Engels kan het als gekozen tweede taal zonder diepe wortels
stellen, maar de druk van de situatie houdt het stevig op zijn
plaats. Het Esperanto mist, ondanks zijn theoretische capaciteiten,
de voordelen van een geografisch centrum en een ''gevangen''
taalgemeenschap.  De organisatorische en educatieve problemen, de
sectarische tendensen en de hieruit voortvloeiende
excentrieke samenstelling van het ledenbestand zijn voor de
Britse beweging reeds adequaat beschreven door de socioloog
Forster (1982).  Sceptici mogen concluderen, dat het Esperanto er
nog niet in geslaagd is zijn vermogen op een werkelijk belangrijk
niveau te bewijzen, en dat de hele vraag naar zijn rol als een
gemeenschappelijke Europese taal, zacht gezegd, voorbarig is.
Laten wij dus bekijken, wat de toekomst zou kunnen brengen.
<P>
Al gaapt er op het ogenblik een brede kloof tussen de posities
van het Engels en het Esperanto, de keus daartussen ligt in het
geheel niet vast.  Aan de ene kant vormt de minderheidspositie
van het Esperanto een zeer belangrijke hindernis voor zijn
aanvaarding als hoofdtaal van de internationale communicatie.
Aan de andere kant stuit, zoals we gezien hebben, ook het Engels
op ernstige politieke barri&#232;res, hoewel die tot nog toe zijn
verbreiding niet ernstig beperkt hebben.  Zal de toekomstige
ontwikkeling de eerste taal of de tweede begunstigen, geen van
beide of beide?  Zolang de internationale communicatie blijft
toenemen, zullen zich ook de posities van sommige wereldtalen versterken,
maar onvoorzienbare factoren spelen mee.  Velen leren nu Japans,
die twintig jaar geleden zelfs niet droomden van die
mogelijkheid;
de economische macht van Azi&#235; blijft toenemen.  Eens in de
toekomst zullen we misschien een toename van de invloed van de
Spaanstalige landen zien, waarvan de taal in feite technisch veel
geschikter is voor de internationale communicatie dan het Engels.
En de grote onvoorzienbare mogelijkheid van de
informatietechnologie - de machinale vertaling - zou alle
vergelijkingen kunnen veranderen (Tonkin 1986).  Die
ontwikkelingen kunnen de taalsituatie in Europa rechtstreeks
raken, eenvoudig omdat het Engels geen bevoorrechte positie onder
de Europese talen inneemt: zijn populariteit berust voor het
grootste deel op externe factoren.  Het lijdt geen twijfel, dat
het Engels in de afzienbare toekomst een plaats onder de
belangrijke Europese en wereldtalen zal behouden.  Maar het
geniet geen enkele garantie van altijddurende superioriteit.
<P>
Het Esperanto neemt daarentegen reeds een werkelijk bevoorrechte positie
in, hoewel die vele praktische nadelen meebrengt.  Als een
internationale plantaal met een werkelijke taalgemeenschap heeft het
geen mededingers, en het lijkt onwaarschijnlijk dat er een
succesrijkere concurrent zal verschijnen (vergelijk Blanke 1985
en hieronder).  Zijn positie hangt af van de voorwaarden van de
internationale communicatie, maar relatief weinig van de
economische en politieke machtsverdeling - behalve in zoverre,
dat een meer gelijkmatige machtsverdeling het gebruik van een taal
die aan geen enkele aparte groep behoort, rechtstreeks
begunstigt.''
Winst voor de politiek van gelijkheid, op Europese en
wereldschaal, maakt het steeds waarschijnlijker, dat het
Esperanto zich een grotere rol zal verwerven.
<P>
Dat is inderdaad het brandpunt van het debat.  Uit Europa is de
laatste eeuwen niet alleen het begrip van gelijkheid gekomen,
maar ook de constatering dat de gelijkheid in sociale verhoudingen
alleen bewust, door planning, en niet door toeval tot stand
gebracht kan worden.  De sociale bewegingen die die constatering
in actie trachten om te zetten, zullen in het Esperanto een ideale
bondgenoot vinden.  Het Engels vertegenwoordigt van nature de
kracht van de traagheid, van het naturalisme; niet omdat het
gebruik ervan gemonopoliseerd wordt door conservatieven, maar omdat het
de mogelijkheid van keuze loochent en dus onvermijdelijk aan
sommige individuen en groepen een bevoorrechte positie boven
andere geeft. Het naturalisme sterft maar moeizaam, inderdaad,
zowel in de Europese politiek als in de Europese cultuur.  Maar
als het inderdaad doodziek is, zullen zulke levendige bastaarden
van rationalisme en pragmatisme, als het Esperanto, ideale
groeivoorwaarden in zijn plaats vinden.
<P>
Men kan zich andere dergelijke bastaards voorstellen.  In deze
eeuw zijn er reeds twee belangrijke bewegingen opgebloeid voor de
hervorming van het Engels, om het geschikter te maken voor een
internationale rol.  Beide genoten een indrukwekkende
intellectuele steun (George Bernard Shaw liet zijn rijkdommen na
voor de hervorming van de Engelse spelling. I.A. Richards
besteedde zijn aanzienlijke talenten aan de propaganda van het
<I>Basic English</I>); beide verkeren nu in een coma.  Maar de boven
geschetste bewustzijnsveranderingen zouden dergelijke pogingen
kunnen doen herleven.  Dichter bij de Esperantopool van het
spectrum kan men zich internationale samenwerking voor de
aanpassing of synthese van bestaande talen voorstellen, dichter bij het
''Gemiddelde Standaard-Europees'' dan het Esperanto. Ook dat heeft
men geprobeerd in het kader van de <I>International Auxiliary
Language Association</I> (1924-1951) en haar schepping het
Interlingua (zie Large 1985, blz. 145-155).  Het fundamentele
probleem waarmee dergelijke projecten geconfronteerd worden, is
het resultaat tot leven te brengen.  Zowel het <I>Basic English</I> als het
Interlingua hebben in hun beste tijd een beperkt gebruik beleefd,
en beide leven misschien nog voort in die zin, dat ze een handvol
sprekers hebben, maar geen van beide kan ook maar tippen aan het
aantal landen, sociale en persoonlijke situaties en doeleinden waarvoor
het Esperanto gebruikt wordt (Blanke 1985, 1989). Er is veel
geschreven, vooral in het Esperanto, over de oorzaken van dat
feit, maar we kunnen er misschien mee volstaan te zeggen, dat de taal een uniek complex sociaal-psychisch
verschijnsel is, dat wij geenszins analytisch begrijpen, zelfs
niet nu wij ze gebruiken om deze woorden te schrijven en te lezen.
Om een taal te scheppen heeft men een buitengewone samenloop van
historische en culturele omstandigheden nodig, talent, instinct en puur
geluk.
<P>
We kunnen andere oplossingen voor het probleem van een
gemeenschappelijke taal voor Europa niet geheel uitsluiten, maar
de twee door Martinet aangegeven polen belichten in feite het
probleem.  Hopelijk ben ik erin geslaagd de voornaamste trekken
aan te wijzen, die de twee talen onderscheiden, en het feit, dat
de synchronische superioriteit van &#233;&#233;n misschien op het ogenblik
de diachronische dynamiek van de andere verhult.  Natuurlijk
spreken we niet over een perspectief op korte termijn, of over
een plotselinge overgang.  Talen verschijnen en verdwijnen niet
binnen enkele jaren; hun eb en vloed voltrekken zich volgens het
ritme van generaties.  Het Engels is aan deze regel onderworpen
en aan deze regel zal ook het Esperanto onderworpen zijn, ondanks
al zijn planmatige eigenschappen.  De oorzaken zijn psychisch (een
radicaal idee heeft tijd nodig om voor het volksbewustzijn
aanvaardbaar te worden), politiek (weinig politici ondersteunen
een idee, dat duidelijk openbare steun mist) en praktisch (denk
maar aan de moeilijkheden in het onderwijs, die zouden volgen op
een plotselinge aanvaarding van de taal).  Al deze factoren zijn
verbonden met de ontwikkeling van het culturele bewustzijn in
Europa als een geheel.  Automatisch is het proces niet, en het is
nog niet te zeggen, of het twee of twintig generaties zal duren.
Maar als de grote vloedgolf van het individualisme en
rationalisme, die ongeveer 25 generaties geleden zijn opmars is begonnen,
het Europese bewustzijn zal blijven voortstuwen, dan zal de
balans van een gemeenschappelijke Europese taal doorslaan van
historische toevalligheden naar een taal die het menselijke
potentieel voor schepping, keuze en vrijheid belichaamt.

Gezinstaal en onderwijstaal</H2>
Wellicht herinner je je nog het standpunt van Koning Albert II dat het een goed idee zou zijn wanneer alle kinderen vanaf de kleuterschool tweetalig onderwijs zouden genieten. De kans dat zij tot echte tweetalige burgers zouden uitgroeien, zou daardoor veel reler worden. Wellicht zullen slechts weinigen het standpunt van de koning afwijzen. Het is wetenschappelijk bewezen dat vroegtijdig taalaanbod in meer dan n taal inderdaad leidt tot meertaligheid. De gevallen waarin zon poging faliekant afloop zijn beperkt. De oorzaken ervoor kunnen verscheiden zijn en de intelectuele capaciteiten van het kind spelen daarin misschien zelfs een minder grote rol, dan de consequente manier waarop men de verschillende talen aanbiedt.
<H3>Een oude wijsheid</H3>
In een artikel in De Standaard (23 november 1996) becommentarieert mevrouw F. PeirsLueken, een psychologe, de groei van het aantal leerlingen in het Nederlandstalig onderwijs in Brussel. Die groei is vooral daaraan te danken dat leerlingen uit tweetalige gezinnen en uit gastarbeidersgezinnen meer voor dat onderwijs kiezen. Die keuze wordt dan weer bevorderd door de betere kwaliteit van dat onderwijs - o.a. omdat er kleinere klassen zijn en door de (langdurige) stakingen in het Franstalig onderwijs. De hoop van gewestminister Grijp is dat deze leerlingen echt tweetalig of althans niet antiVlaams zullen worden. Dat n van de voordelen, de kleine klassen, dreigt te verdwijnen, wordt door de minister over het hoofd gezien.
<P>Mevrouw Peirs merkt echter op dat het met de taalontwikkeling van de anderstalige leerlingen niet altijd van een leien dakje loop en stelt dat klaarblijkelijk niet alle leerlingen meertaligheid aankunnen. Zij meldt dat 7/8jarigen vaak nauwelijks het taalniveau van 3/4jarigen halen. Omdat het over normaal begaafde leerlingen gaat, veroorzaakt deze taalhandicap lees en schrijfproblemen, maar ook problemen in de rekenles. De leerlingen beseffen maar al te goed hun probleem en raken gefrustreerd met alle gevolgen vandien: depressie, aggresiviteit en onverschilligheid.
<P>Voor taalzwakke of taalontwikkelingsvertraagde kinderen zijn er wel speciale opvangprogramma's, maar die gelden enkel wanneer de taalachterstand niet te wijten is aan meertaligheid. Wellicht is die bepaling het gevolg van een slecht begrepen verdediging van het Nederlands. De groep waarvan hier sprake is, komt voor die programma's dus niet in aanmerking. Voor hen is de enige uitweg overplaatsing naar BLO, wat zeker ook niet de juiste oplossing is.
<P>Om het probleem te ondervangen stelt de minister voor de anderstalige leerlingen in de tellingen zwaarder te laten doorwegen, zodat voor probleemgevallen meer leerkrachten kunnen worden ingezet.
De auteur van het artikel juicht dit toe, maar zij stelt toch dat wanneer de problemen te groot worden, er slechts n oplossing is. De leerlingen moeten worden verwezen naar het Franstalige net, ook wanneer dat een achteruitgang van het leerlingenaantal in het Nederlandstalig onderwijs betekent. Leerlingen zijn geen onderwijsbuit en gezinstaal = onderwijstaal blijft een gouden stelregel.
<H3>Een andere kijk</H3>
Misschien moet er in de hele problematiek toch nog een aantal andere elementen in overweging worden genomen. Zo blijkt uit het artikel niet duidelijk waarom de taalzwakke leerlingen minder goed presteren. Heeft dat inderdaad alleen met taalzwakheid te maken of ook met taalminderheid? Indien in n klas leerlingen zitten waarvan de enen les krijgen in hun moedertaal (het Nederlands), terwijl anderen in een tweede taal de les moeten volgen, dan wordt daardoor een situatie van ongelijkheid gecreerd. Wanneer noch de onderwijsmethode, noch de meting van de resultaten is aangepast aan hun specifieke taalsituatie van nietautochtone of andertalige kinderen, dan lijkt het onvermijdelijk dat zij minder goed presteren. Wanneer die resultaten dan ook nog worden vergeleken met de resultaten van hun Nederlandstalige klasgenootjes, wat in het toch nog altijd competitieve onderwijs niet onwaarschijnlijk is, dan is de bron voor de frustratie ook niet ver te zoeken.
<P>Een ander element in het probleem is het taalgebruik thuis. Tijdens een colloquium in Bratislava, in het kader van de Ontmoeting van Esperantogezinnen (REF, aug. 1996), werd het probleem van zigeunerkinderen in Slovakije ter sprake gebracht. Uit onderzoek bij de zigeunerpopulatie bleek dat kinderen van ouders die afstappen van de eigen zigeunertaal, meer taal en leerproblemen kregen, dan leerlingen waarvan de ouders zich strikt hielden aan de eigen moedertaal. Dat verschil kon niet door intelligentieverschil worden verklaard.
Het is duidelijk dat de ouders hier voor een groot dilemma worden gesteld. Enerzijds moeten zij om zich te integreren in de locale gemeenschap, zelf de omgevingstaal leren en die dus ook zo veel mogelijk proberen te spreken. Anderzijds veroorzaken zij, door thuis over te schakelen op die onderwijstaal/omgevingstaal - die zij slechts gebrekkig beheersen - dat hun kinderen geconfronteerd worden met incoherent en vaak slecht taalaanbod, waardoor taalverwervingsstoornissen kunnen optreden.
<P>Ook de overheid staat hier voor een dilemma. Immers, om juist in te spelen op de noden van de leerlingen, zouden zij de gezinstaal en cultuur van die leerlingen moeten ondersteunen. Dat is een politiek die op lange termijn (van drie generaties) de integratie bevordert, maar die momenteel in een Europa (of misschien zelfs een wereld) waarin de nationalistische reflex zo sterk is, nauwelijks te verdedigen, laat staan te voeren is.
<P>Toch zou het stilaan duidelijk moeten zijn dat in een verenigd Europa cultuurpolitiek, niet de politiek voor de cultuur van een regio in Europa moet zijn, maar de politiek voor de verschillende culturen in een regio. Het Esperanto kan bij zo'n politiek een waardevolle en overbruggende rol spelen. Daarom zijn wij overigens van mening dat het Esperanto als onderwijsvak in Europa moet worden ingevoerd.<BR>

Het voordeel van het nadeel
</H2>
<I>
In onze zoektocht naar denkende steun voor ons
idee stootten we in De Morgen van 6 juni 1996 op ongevraagde steun van een
Vlaming die bekend staat voor zijn inzet voor de Nederlandse taal, vroegere
TV-reporter, thans literator, Geert Van Istendael. We nemen de tekst
integraal en ongewijzigd (op c/k's na) over en hopen dat hij het ons niet
euvel duidt wat auteursrechten betreft. De redactie is intussen actief op
zoek naar andere denkende Vlamingen die hun zegje over het Esperanto willen
doen. Ons blad kan daar enkel bij winnen.
</I><P>
<HR>
<P>
Laatst kreeg ik een curieus geschrift toegestuurd. Het kwam van het
Algemeen Nederlands Verbond. Het ging over de bescherming van het
Nederlands in de Europese Unie.
<P>
De Europese Unie mag voor mijn part vandaag nog uit elkaar spatten, die kan
het niet laten systematisch alles te vernietigen wat mij in Europa lief is.
Ik keilde het mij toegezondene dus de mand met brandhout in die naast de
kachel staat. Weg met de Europese Unie, leve Europa. Maar het weer sloeg
om, de zon begon te schijnen en gisterenavond staarde de bescherming van
mijn moedertaal mij nog altijd aan daar tussen de kleingezaagde planken en
stronken. Ik redde het drukseltje van de brandstapel en begon te lezen.
<P>
Het spreekt vanzelf dat die algemene Nederlanders willen dat het Nederlands
de Europese Unie overleeft. Ook ik wil dat. Maar intussen weet ik dat bij
voorbeeld in alle mogelijke voorbereidende vergaderingen met technici en
deskundigen het Engels en het Frans al oppermachtig heersen. De arrogantie
van grote talen is zo groot als het staatsapparaat dat die taal hanteert.
In de wandelgangen van het Europees Parlement schijnt het nog erger te
zijn. Ik verneem dat bijna iedereen daar glunderend een soort
steenkolenengels hakkelt.
<P>
Alle talen behouden, dat is duur, dat is verwarrend, zo kun je niet werken!
Dat roepen vooral mensen uit grote taalgebieden. Eigenlijk bedoelen ze: die
kleintjes moeten hun bek houden of onze taal spreken, Frans of Engels zijn
toch veel belangrijker dan bij voorbeeld Nederlands.
<P>
Waar hebben we zoiets nog gehoord? Zei kardinaal Mercier bij het begin van
deze eeuw niet dat het Nederlands ongeschikt was voor wetenschappelijk
onderzoek? Rond die tijd kreeg professor Kamerlingh Onnes uit Leiden de
Nobelprijs voor natuurkunde, en die man publiceerde in het Nederlands. Ik
heb helemaal geen zin om me op het einde van deze eeuw opnieuw te laten
discrimineren terwille van mijn taal.
<P>
U moet realistisch zijn, meneer, het Engels is nu eenmaal d&#233; wereldtaal.
Pardon, ga dat eerst maar eens uitleggen aan Spanjaarden of Fransen. En ten
tweede, waarom zou Europa de taal die zich economisch en commercieel en
juist daardoor ook politiek en cultureel brutaal opdringt nog eens moeten
gaan privilegi&#235;ren? Want laten we ons geen illusies maken, samen met het
Engels dringt niet het beste, maar het meest verwerpelijke van de
Angelsaksische cultuur krachtig ons dagelijkse leven binnen; ik noem maar
de smalle, hypocrite erotiek van Amerikaanse soaps of de toxicologie die de
Britten kookkunst noemen. De vigerende Amerikaans-Britse opvatting over hoe
een samenleving in elkaar moet zitten, krijgen we er gratis bij.
<P>
En Frans dan? Ik hou zeer van die taal - ik ben trouwens ook dol op Engels
- maar dat kunnen wij, Vlamingen, met onze emancipatiegeschiedenis toch
echt niet maken. Duits? Kommt nicht in Frage.
<P>
In dat verslagje van die algemene Nederlanders is voortdurend sprake van
Esperanto. Ik denk bij die taal onmiddellijk aan vegetari&#235;rs op sandalen,
aan vooroorlogse socialisten met schillerkragen, kortom aan brave, doch
lichtelijk geschifte wereldverbeteraars. Anderzijds heeft dat curiosum een
paar verrassende voordelen: alle burgers van de Europese Unie zouden gelijk
zijn voor de taal en naar het schijnt is de spraakkunst ongelooflijk
eenvoudig.
<P>
H&#233;t grote nadeel - afgezien van het kunstmatige en het wereldvreemde,
typische eigenschappen van de Europese Unie overigens - is natuurlijk dat
die taal door geen enkel commercieel imperium, door geen enkel
multinationaal bedrijf en al zeker door geen enkel staatsapparaat wordt
gedragen. Esperanto is een taal zonder macht. Het zal nooit andere talen
bedreigen, niet het Engels of het Frans, natuurlijk niet, maar ook niet het
Nederlands. Maak ik mezelf nu belachelijk? Kweenie. want dat grote nadeel,
is dat niet juist een onschatbaar voordeel?

<H2>Gemakkelijk(heid)s(te)-oplossing</H2>
<H3>Zal Europa in het Engels of in het Esperanto worden bestuurd?</H3>
<H4>
Over die vraag publiceren we hier de opinie van John C. Wells,
hoogleraar in de fonetiek aan de Universiteit van Londen.
</H4>
<H4>
Het probleem
</H4>
Het voordeel van het aannemen van &#233;&#233;n enkele gemeenschappelijke taal voor
communicatie over nationale en lingu&#239;stische grenzen heen, staat
ongetwijfeld voor iedereen buiten kijf. Niemand kan erin slagen alle 11
offici&#235;le talen van de Europese Unie (EU) (Deens, Duits, Engels, Fins,
Frans, Grieks, Italiaans, Nederlands, Spaans, Portugees en Zweeds) te
beheersen, nog afgezien van de andere talen die er in de loop der jaren
naarmate de Unie zich uitbreidt, zouden kunnen worden toegevoegd (IJslands,
Kroatisch, Tsjechisch, Ests, Lets, Hongaars, Litauws, Pools, Slovaaks,
Sloveens, Turks...). Op wereldvlak moeten we rekening houden met ruim
vijftig gestandaardiseerde geschreven talen en meer dan 3000 verschillende
talen in het totaal.
Welke taal zullen wij gebruiken om handel te drijven
met de Arabische wereld, met China, met Japan? We hebben een tweede taal
nodig die iedereen kan leren om te gebruiken naast de eigen moedertaal.

<H4>Engels</H4>

Momenteel probeert de wereld dit probleem te ondervangen door massaal te
kiezen voor het Engels. In steeds toenemende mate heeft in de tweede helft
van deze eeuw de opinie post gevat, dat het Engels is voorbestemd om d&#233;
internationale taal te worden, die door iedereen moet worden geleerd. Sinds
het einde van de Tweede Wereldoorlog wordt het Engels inderdaad onderwezen
in de meeste scholen van West-Europa en zelfs van de wereld. Er is nu een
generatie van jonge volwassenen en van middelbare leeftijd die op school
Engels hebben geleerd en die dus in staat zouden moeten zijn die taal te
gebruiken voor internationale communicatie. En tot op zekere hoogte kunnen
zij dat ook. Velen hebben inderdaad genoeg Engels als vreemde taal geleerd
om basisinformatie uit te wisselen.
<P>
Jammer genoeg zijn ze echter inderdaad slechts in staat om (vrij triviale)
basisinformatie uit te wisselen. Voor meer complexe en subtiele
onderwerpen, zowel in gesproken als in geschreven vorm, blijkt hun kennis
al te vaak onvoldoende te zijn. Dit is zelfs het geval voor diegenen die
heel wat jaren hebben geofferd aan vlijtige studie van de taal. Sommigen
menen dat zij best wel wat Engels kunnen lezen en verstaan, maar dikwijls
voelen zij zich onzeker en zwak wanneer het erop aan komt om zelf te
spreken en te schrijven.
Wanneer zij geconfronteerd worden met de typische
manieren van spreken van Britten, Amerikanen of andere moedertaalsprekers
(van het Engels), kunnen zij niet meer volgen; in elk geval kunnen zij niet
meer ongeremd aan het gesprek deelnemen of als gelijkwaardige partners
onderhandelen. Marktonderzoek door het reclamebureau Lintas (Parijs 1989)
toonde aan dat een eenvoudige Engelse testzin in Nederland door minder dan
de helft  van de testpersonen (een representatief staal van de volwassen
bevolking) correct werd begrepen; in Duitsland door minder dan &#233;&#233;n derde en
door minder dan 10 % in Frankrijk, Spanje en Itali&#235;.
<P>
In Itali&#235;   begreep zelfs minder dan 4 % de zin correct; en van de
testpersonen jonger dan 25 gaf (toch nog altijd) nauwelijks 7 % een juist
antwoord. De conclusie kan niet anders zijn dan dat zelfs na jaren
onderwijs in het Engels op zijn minst de Italianen er niet in zijn geslaagd
het taalprobleem op te lossen.
<P>
De redenen waarom deze leerlingen zo weinig succes hebben bij het studeren
van het Engels zijn legio. De fonetiek van het Engels veroorzaakt grote
moeilijkheden. De spelling van de taal is, zoals welbekend, totaal
inconsistent. De woordvorming is vrij eenvoudig, maar de zinsbouw is
opvallend ingewikkeld eens men het niveau van de enkelvoudige zin verlaat.
De woordenschat is rijk - d.w.z. zeer uitgebreid, maar deze rijkdom brengt
voor de leerling het probleem mee dat hij heel wat geheugenenergie moet
spenderen om het subtiele verschil in betekenis tussen bijna-synoniemen te
onthouden. De samengestelde werkwoorden betekenen even zoveel valkuilen.
In het werkwoordsysteem is vooral de notie ``aspect'' een rijke bron voor
vergissingen. Verder worden tal van ``functiewoorden'',
essentieel voor een
juist begrip en een juiste interpretatie van nuances, in het normale
taalgebruik ``zwak'' gerealiseerd - dit wil zeggen onbeklemtoond en vaak in
een verkorte vorm.
Daardoor worden ze vaak niet opgemerkt door
niet-moedertaalsprekers. Anderzijds wekken deze laatsten door deze vormen
wel beklemtoond uit te spreken, bij moedertaalsprekers de indruk dat zij
een bijzondere nadruk op die woorden willen leggen. Tenslotte is de
klemtoon van Engelse woorden erg veranderlijk en slechts in beperkte mate
onderhevig aan regels, dus voorspelbaar. Daarenboven is de intonatie - de
zinsmelodie - ingewikkelder dan in de meeste andere talen.
<P>
Er zijn echter ook nog externe redenen waarom het Engels eigenlijk niet
aanvaardbaar is als gemeenschappelijke internationale taal. Het is unfair:
Engels gebruiken geeft aan de moedertaalsprekers van die taal een oneerlijk
voordeel. In Europa zijn dat de Britten en Ieren, in de wereld komen daar
de Amerikanen, de Australi&#235;rs en anderen bij.
Velen zien daarin het gevaar
dat de wereldmoza&#239;ek van inheemse talen en culturen zal worden omgeruild
voor de alles-verslindende Amerikaanse Coca-Cola en Disneyland pletwals.
<H4>
Esperanto
</H4>
De gebruikers van het Esperanto hebben bewezen - en bewijzen elke dag
opnieuw - dat er een andere weg is. Als een ``ontworpen'' taal, gebaseerd op
Europese wortels maar verregaand gestandaardiseerd, biedt het Esperanto het
voordeel dat het veel gemakkelijker te leren is dan etnische talen. Een
eeuw van effectief gebruik in tal van landen heeft bewezen dat het een
levende, functionerende taal is en niet het &#233;&#233;n of ander
studeerkamerproject. (Het is nog steeds niet algemeen geweten dat Esperanto
een echte taal is waarin honderdduizenden mensen met elkaar spreken: elkaar
ontmoeten, trouwen en kinderen groot brengen.)
<P>
Daarom betekent het Esperanto een eerlijke oplossing voor het probleem. Het
Esperanto behoort niet toe aan een bepaalde natie of etnische groep - het
is ieders eigendom op gelijkwaardige wijze. Het geeft aan geen enkele
taalgroep een overwicht over alle anderen. Het is ongetwijfeld oneindig
veel eerlijker dat 100 % van de wereldbevolking een gemakkelijke taal moet
leren, dan dat 90 % een moeilijke taal moet leren, terwijl 10 % - door het
stom toeval dat zij toevallig in een bepaald land geboren zijn - die taal
gratis voor niets krijgen.
<H4>
Besluit
</H4>
Het Esperanto verdedigen en naar voren schuiven betekent een radicaal
herdenken van onze houding tegenover het taalprobleem in de wereld. De
kracht van een status quo is zeer groot - er zijn tal van politieke,
economische en sociale factoren om het huidige gebruik van het Engels voort
te zetten. Toch wil ik er met aandrang op wijzen dat de argumenten die voor
het invoeren van het Esperanto pleiten, op lange-termijn sterker zullen
blijken. Esperanto vertegenwoordigt ontegensprekelijk een gelijkere en een
effici&#235;ntere oplossing voor het taalprobleem in de wereld.

<h3>Vaarwel mooie droom</H3>
<H2>Over de taalpolitiek in de Europese Unie</H2>
<H4>
Tijdens het <I>Internacia Festivalo</I>, een samenkomst van ervaren
Esperantosprekers van middelbare leeftijd en hun gezin, gaf dr. Werner
Bormann een lezing over de taalpolitiek in Europa. Wij vroegen dr. Bormann
zijn tekst voor ons op papier te zetten. Hier volgt, in Nederlandse
vertaling, een verkorte versie van zijn lezing.</H4>

Toen de Europese &#233;&#233;nmaking begon, in 1952, namen daar zes staten aan deel.
In die zes staten werden vier verschillende talen gesproken. Van die vier
torende het Frans - dat toen nog een wereldtaal was - boven de anderen uit.
De drie andere namen een gelijkwaardige tweederangspositie in: het
Nederlands en het Italiaans, die nauwelijks enige grensoverschrijdende
betekenis hadden, en het Duits als taal van de overwonnenen.
<P>
In zulke constellatie was taalgelijkheid - met het voorkeurgebruik van &#233;&#233;n
van de talen als primus inter pares - realiseerbaar en was de situatie
aanvaardbaar voor elk van de deelnemers.
<P>
De oprichtingsdocumenten verklaarden dus in 1958 taalgelijkheid als een
valabele basis (artikel 217 en decreet nr. 1). En alle Europe&#235;rs schatten
dit principe zeer hoog. Het houdt stand tot op de dag van vandaag, 1996,
zelfs in een Europese Unie met 15 lidstaten en 11 talen. E&#233;n van de
verwijten naar het Esperanto toe is dan ook dat Europa het multiculturele
nodig heeft, ook waar het de talen betreft, en dat &#233;&#233;ntaligheid uit den
boze is.
<P>
Maar hoe vaak gaapt er niet een afgrond tussen de wens en de realiteit. Elf
talen is een hoeveelheid die niet meer te hanteren valt. En 11 talen toont
ook niet de realiteit. Immers, in werkelijkheid bestaan er naast die 11
offici&#235;le talen nog tal van ``minderheidstalen'', waaraan de status
``officieel'' wordt ontzegd. Onder die minderheidstalen bevindt zich
bijvoorbeeld het Catalaans, dat met 7 miljoen sprekers nochtans de 5
miljoen sprekers van het Deens - dat wel de status ``offici&#235;le taal'' geniet
- in ruime mate overtreft.
<P>
Het terugbrengen van het aantal gebruikte offici&#235;le talen naar een kleiner
aantal, is een dreiging die constant de Europese horizon bezwangert, maar
het wordt zowel door de publieke opinie als door de politiek afgewezen.
Nochtans worden er wel offici&#235;le stappen gezet om het aantal talen te
verminderen.
<P>
Het bouwwerk van de Europese Unie is gegrondvest op drie zuilen: de
economische, de buitenlands-politieke en de intern-politieke. Het
voorschrift van taalgelijkheid geldt enkel op het vlak van economische
integratie (de Europese Gemeenschap). Over rechtspraak en interne
aangelegenheden bestaat er geen enkele regelgeving, en daar worden die
talen gebruikt die toevallig door de deelnemers worden beheerst, in casu
meestal het Engels.
<P>
Maar voor de ``Gemeenschappelijke Politiek over Buitenlandse Zaken en
Veiligheid'' hebben de lidstaten een gemeenschappelijk standpunt
onderschreven over het beperken van het aantal talen. Voor geschreven
contacten op dit gebied geldt COREU.
<P>
Die afkorting betekent: correspondance europ&#233;enne - een Franse uitdrukking,
die echter uitsluitend in zijn afgekorte vorm wordt gebruikt omdat de term
``coreu'' neutraal lijkt. Wanneer men de index van het Verdrag van Maastricht
erop naslaat, vindt men over de kwestie van het taalgebruik dus twee
paginaverwijzingen: die naar artikel 217 en die naar COREU.
<P>
Welke talen zich onder dit masker verbergen, wordt nergens gedefinieerd.
Bij navraag krijgt men ten antwoord: het gaat over ``de talen van de
diplomatie''. Maar ook die categorie wordt nergens nader omschreven. Maar
daarover bestaat wel een zogenaamd ``diplomatiek gebruik'', en volgens dat
gebruik zijn de talen van de diplomatie het Frans en het Engels. (Het
Russisch is er net uit weggevallen - vreemde samenloop van omstandigheden.)
<P>
Dit is met evenveel woorden een onderschreven overtreding van het principe
van de taalgelijkheid. Het Engels en het Frans zijn meer gelijk dan de
andere talen.
<P>
Deze reductie is nochtans zeer begrijpelijk. Er valt in de praktijk
inderdaad niet te werken met een absolute gelijkheid van 11 talen. Reeds
het gebruik van slechts twee werktalen is een onaangename belasting.
Overigens heeft drie werktalen gebruiken meer nadelen dan voordelen. En
daaruit volgt dat de kansen van het Duits om het ooit verder te schoppen,
erg gering zijn. Het vlotst verloopt alles wanneer er maar &#233;&#233;n taal wordt
gebruikt.
<P>
Het buitenwippen van talen die als ``onbelangrijk'' worden beschouwd, gebeurt
dus onder druk van de feiten. Daarom is het ook gemakkelijk te begrijpen
dat men deze weg verder blijft bewandelen.
<P>
Het ministercomit&#233; installeerde, per decreet van december 1993, het
Internationaal Merkenbureau in Alicante (Spanje). Zijn opdracht is
handelsmerken registreren en beschermen.
<P>
Ondernemingen kunnen hun handelsmerk deponeren in &#233;&#233;n van de 11 offici&#235;le
talen van de Europese Unie, tegelijkertijd moeten zij uit ``de talen van het
bureau'' die taal aanduiden waarin zij de verdere afwikkelingen wensen uit
te voeren. Het bureau heeft vijf talen: (alfabetisch) Duits, Engels, Frans,
Italiaans en Spaans. Dit is een door alle staten aanvaarde regeling.
<P>
Er bestaan nog andere reducties van het aantal gebruikte talen. Het Engels
is vrijwel altijd onder de winnaars. Het Frans haalt het vaak. Het Duits
soms, maar het Nederlands zeer zelden en het Grieks vrijwel nooit.
<P>
Ongelijkheid heerst, terwijl gelijkheid hoog in het vaandel wordt gedragen
- we moeten dus wel zeggen: ``Adieu, mooie droom!''

<h2>
Vijftig jaar Verenigde Naties
</h2>
<h3>
Tot vlak voor zijn dood was Edward Symoens, erevoorzitter van de Vlaamse
Esperantobond, nog erg actief met tal van projecten. De meeste daarvan
waren pogingen om het Esperanto onder de aandacht te brengen van grote
internationale instellingen. Op 21 december 1995, de dag van zijn dood, zou
hij nog een lezing hebben gegeven over ``Vijftig jaar Verenigde Naties''. Als
eerbetoon en omdat de tekst zelf ook bijzonder waardevol is, publiceren wij
hem in de bladzijden van Horizontaal.
</H3>
Waarom tijdens een Esperantobijeenkomst spreken over ``50 jaar Verenigde
Naties''? Welk verband ligt er tussen beide? Er zijn meer verbanden dan wij
op het eerste gezicht zouden denken. Beide zijn immers van structuur en
doelstelling supra-nationaal, reiken over de nationale grenzen en
entiteiten, omvatten principieel de hele mensheid. Beide beogen een
harmonische samenleving van alle mensen, van welke sociale of etnische
oorsprong ze ook mogen zijn. Ik zeg wel: beogen, want het einddoel ligt
zeker nog niet in het verschiet. Ook kan de internationale taal Esperanto
ooit eens een grote rol spelen in de Verenigde Naties. Waarom niet
realistisch blijven dromen, geloven en hopen?
<H4>
Van klein tot groot
</H4>
De VN zijn, wat men ook van die instelling moge denken, een grote stap
voorwaarts in een eeuwenlange evolutie. Er was een tijd, lang geleden, dat
in eenzelfde stad de ene wijk in opstand kwam en vocht tegen een andere
wijk, tot het hoofd van de stad zei: ``Genoeg gevochten nu, allen aan tafel
en uitspreken wat er hapert.'' Dat slaagde niet in een handomdraai. Er ging
heel wat tijd overheen alvorens het stadsgezag sterk genoeg was om
vechtende partijen uit elkaar te houden. En misschien nog wel langer duurde
het vooraleer bij deze partijen het inzicht gerijpt was, dat er naast
vechten - een oerinstinct van de mens - misschien nog andere wegen waren om
tot een vergelijk te komen...
<P>
Later gingen steden elkaar bevechten. Tot een graaf of hertog hen aan de
onderhandelingstafel bracht. Dan vocht diezelfde graaf of hertog tegen een
andere graaf of hertog, tot de koning tussenbeide kwam en de vechtende
partijen willens nillens tot een overeenkomst dwong. Toen vochten
eeuwenlang staatshoofen en landen tegen elkaar en de conflicten werden
alsmaar groter en vernietigender.
<P>
Boven de van elkaar losstaande nationale staatshoofden stond er helaas geen
enkel supranationaal gezag om de vechtende partijen uit elkaar te houden.
Daarom is het van zo'n groot belang, dat op 10 januari 1920, na wat wij de
Eerste Wereldoorlog noemen, voor de eerste maal in de geschiedenis een
supranationale wereldorganisatie tot stand kwam ``tot bevordering van de
internationale samenwerking en ter verzekering van vrede en veiligheid
onder de volken''. (WP, nr. 23, p. 330) Deze vereniging was de ``Volkenbond'',
la Soci&#233;t&#233; des Nations. In het begin heeft deze Volkenbond zeer goed werk
verricht en ei zo na zou ook het Esperanto er zijn fina venko (zijn
``laatste overwinning'', zijn uiteindelijke doorbraak) hebben bereikt. Immers
in 1922 waren vrijwel alle leden, na een grondig onderzoek, bereid het
Esperanto als offici&#235;le taal te erkennen. Alleen een veto van de Franse
delegatie, op uitdrukkelijk bevel van de Franse regering, heeft dit
onmogelijk gemaakt.
<H4>
Vallen en opstaan
</H4>
Slechts in het licht van de hoger geschetste menselijke evolutie kunnen wij
het ontstaan, sommige successen, maar ook het vele falen van de
supra-nationale organisaties zoals de vroegere Volkenbond en de huidige
Verenigde Naties, enigszins begrijpen.
<P>
``Nooit is iets definitiefs verworven'' is een fundamentele waarheid van het
menselijk leven. Alles moet permanent onderhouden, aangepast, gekoesterd en
vooral verder ontwikkeld worden. Dit geldt zowel op het individuele als op
het collectieve vlak: liefde, vriendschap, beheersen van instincten, vrede,
politiek... Het geldt evenzeer voor de Internationale Organisaties.
<h4>
De geboorte van een instelling
</H4>
Wat we tot nog toe gezegd hebben, dient alleen om de Verenigde Naties - ons
eigenlijke onderwerp - in een historisch en vooral een algemeen menselijk
en maatschappelijk perspectief te plaatsen. De VN kwamen er nadat de
Volkenbond na enkele ups, maar vooral veel downs, na 26 jaar werking, op 19
april 1946, officieel ophield te bestaan. De Verenigde Staten van Amerika
hebben nooit deel uitgemaakt van die Volkenbond.
<P>
De basis voor de VN werd in 1941 tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog gelegd door
president Roosevelt van de Verenigde Staten en Eerste Minister Churchill
van Groot-Brittanni&#235;. Het handvest werd op 26 juni 1945 in San Francisco
door 50 landen officieel ondertekend. Op dit ogenblik zijn er 185 landen
lid van de Verenigde Naties.
<P>
Geeft men er zich wel voldoende rekenschap van, hoe aartsmoeilijk het is om
zoveel volkeren, met zoveel totaal verschillende talen, culturen,
ervaringen, ontwikkeling, verzuchtingen en vooral tegenstrijdige belangen,
tot &#233;&#233;n samenhangen en harmonisch geheel te versmelten? Zoiets vraagt tijd,
ontzettend veel tijd. Zoiets vraagt ook een nooit aflatende en verbeten
inspanning. In het licht van deze vaststelling moeten we de tekortkomingen
en de fouten van deze gigantische instelling beoordelen. Fouten moeten niet
worden goedgepraat, maar evenmin mag er twijfel zijn over de noodzaak van
de instelling zelf.
<H4>
De structuur van de VN
</H4>
In de Algemene Vergadering zijn alle leden vertegenwoordigd. Elk lid heeft
er &#233;&#233;n stem. Principieel komt ze elk jaar in september/oktober in New York
- waar de zetel is gevestigd - bijeen, om over de algemene wereldproblemen
te discussi&#235;ren.
<P>
De Veiligheidsraad bestaat uit vijf permanente leden (China, Frankrijk,
Rusland, USA, Groot-Brittanni&#235;), elk met een veto-recht, en tien voor twee
jaar door de Algemene Vergadering verkozen leden. De Veiligheidsraad heeft
de primaire verantwoordelijkheid voor de handhaving van de internationale
vrede en veiligheid. Alle vertegenwoordigers moeten permanent in New York
aanwezig zijn, opdat de Raad op elk ogenblik bijeen zou kunnen komen. Dat
gebeurt op verzoek van &#233;&#233;n of meer staten, van de Algemene Vergadering of
van de Secretaris-Generaal.
<P>
De Secretaris-Generaal is hoofd van een algemeen secretariaat met meer dan
20 000 stafleden. Het is de eigenlijke spil van de organisatie.
<P>
Onder de hoofdorganen van de VN worden ook gerekend: de Economische en
Sociale Raad, die de economische en sociale activiteiten van de VN
co&#246;rdineert, onder het gezag van de Algemene Vergadering; de Voogdijraad,
die zich met de dekolonisatie heeft beziggehouden; en het Internationaal
Gerechtshof.
<P>
Naast die hoofdorganen zijn er ook nog een aantal autonome organen: UNCTAD,
een permanent orgaan van de VN dat zich bezighoudt met de problematiek ten
aanzien van de ontwikkeling van economisch achtergebleven landen; UNDRO:
een bureau van de VN onder leiding van de Co&#246;rdinator voor rampenhulp;
UNIDO: in 1966 door de Algemene Vergadering van de VN ingesteld, een
autonoom orgaan, gevestigd in Wenen, dat zich toelegt op de bevordering van
de industrialisatie van de ontwikkelingslanden; UNICEF: in 1946 opgericht
en onder de Economische en Sociale Raad ressorterend kindernoodfonds van de
VN.
<H4>
Op weg naar...
</H4>
De concrete doelstellingen van de VN zijn:
<UL>
<LI>    de internationale vrede en veiligheid handhaven;
<LI>    vriendschappelijke betrekkingen tussen staten tot stand brengen;
<LI>    internationale samenwerking tot stand brengen bij het oplossen van
internationale vraagstukken van economische, sociale, culturele of
humanitaire aard, alsmede het bevorderen en stimuleren van eerbied voor de
Rechten van de Mens en de fundamentele vrijheden.
</UL>
Het valt op hoe in de Esperantogemeenschap bijna dezelfde terminologie
wordt gebrukkt: vrede (ook taalvrede!), verstandhouding, samenwerking,
eerbied voor de Rechten van de Mens. Maar daar houdt de vergelijking niet
mee op. De taal, in het algemeen, heeft een ontwikkeling doorgemaakt, die
ongeveer gelijkloopt met de politieke evolutie van wijk- naar stads- en
regiotalen. Daarna van regionale naar nationale taal. De evolutie van
nationale talen naar &#233;&#233;n supra-nationale taal is volop in beweging.
<P>
De grondtrek van die historische evolutie, zowel in de politiek als bij de
taal, is een streven naar een principi&#235;le neutraliteit en objectiviteit om
de op beide terreinen bestaande conflicten en tegenstellingen op te vangen
en te neutraliseren.
<P>
De VN staan principieel neutraal tegenover alle aangesloten leden, kleine
of grote, ontwikkelde of minder ontwikkelde. Zo ook staat het Esperanto
principieel neutraal tegenover zowel de grote wereldtalen als de kleinste
regionale talen of dialecten. Beide instellingen streven ernaar iedere vorm
van geweld te ondervangen door overreding, samenspraak en overleg.
<P>
Dit gaat echter tegen het menselijk oerinstinct in. Dat is gegrond op
overlevingsdrift en het recht van de sterktste, op fysische macht om
conflicten op te lossen. Door een uiterst langzame beschavingsevolutie
treedt echter bij sommige mensen de Rede op de voorgrond. De rede tracht
het primaire oerinstinct te bedwingen, te neutraliseren en te vervangen
door meer menswaardige methoden om de onvermijdelijke tegenstellingen,
geschillen en vooral persoonlijke belangen voor iedereen aanvaardbaar te
maken.
<P>
In het kader van die evolutie moeten we ook de ontwikkeling van het begrip
``Rechten van de Mens'' plaatsen. Het gaat niet om de rechten van de blanke,
gele of zwarte mens; evenmin om die van de rijke of de arme; noch om die
van de ontwikkelde of de (zogenaamd) onderontwikkelde mens, maar om de
rechten van de mens, zonder meer, wie dat ook weze.
<H4>
De tijd aan onze zijde
</H4>
Een ander fundamenteel begrip dat meestal over het hoofd wordt gezien bij
de beoordeling van succes of mislukking van vooral wereldomvattende
projecten zoals de VN, maar ook het Esperanto, is het begrip tijd. In de
maatschappij waarin wij leven, wordt dit essenti&#235;le begrip al te vaak tot
het heden herleid, zonder rekening te houden met zijn verlenging in het
verleden en de toekomst. Evenmin wordt aandacht besteed aan de ermee
verbonden groei-, aanpassings- en assimilatieprocessen.
<P>
Van alles wil men dadelijk definitieve resultaten zien. Dat kan gewoon
niet. Zo zijn de mens en de natuur niet geschapen. Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
de huidige Secretaris-Generaal van de VN, drukt het in een interview
(Knack, 12-18 juli 1995) als volgt uit: ``Weet u, internationale
onderhandelingen, dat is een heel traag proces. Onze nieuwe cultuur heeft
er ons ongelukkig genoeg aan gewend onmiddellijke resultaten te willen
zien. Men wil oploskoffie: heet water erop, en klaar. Terwijl,
bijvoorbeeld, de traditie van theedrinken in Japan: dat duurt een uur. En
het ongeduldige publiek zegt al gauw, het is mislukt! Maar om zoiets te
doen lukken, dat vraagt jaren werk! U vindt het normaal dat u vijftien of
twintig jaar nodig had om uw studie te voltooien. Maar dan wilt u een
conflict tussen twee staten, dat veertig jaar heeft geduurd, regelen in
enkele maanden?''
<H4>
Conclusie
</H4>
De bedoeling van deze lezing was niet een technische uiteenzetting te geven
over het reilen en zeilen van de Verenigde Naties. Ik heb geprobeerd de
instelling in een ruimer historisch en maatschappelijk perspectief te
plaatsen en een band te leggen tussen onze beweging en die supra-nationale
organisatie.
<P>
Het is niet omdat onze beweging hoogtes of laagtes kent, dat ze zou moeten
verdwijnen. Het is ook niet omdat de VN hoogtes en laagtes kent, dat die
organisatie zou moeten verdwijnen. Zoals wij ons permanent moeten aanpassen
aan de ontzaglijk snel evoluerende wereld om ons heen - en dat doen we
helaas niet genoeg! - zo is ook de VN aan een grote schoonmaakbeurt toe...
ook op taalgebied. Onlangs verscheen in La Libre Belgique (3 nov. 1995) een
artikel onder de titel: ``Nations Unies. Duel franco-am&#233;ricain  propos du
multilinguisme''. (Verenigde Naties. Frans-Amerikaans duel over de
veeltaligheid). Het artikel eindigt als volgt: ``Diplomaten van alle
continenten maken zich ongerust over een eventuele overheersing van het
Engels in de VN en spreken over een totale veramerikanisering van de
internationale organisatie.'' We kunnen deze uitlatingen beschouwen als het
zoveelste bewijs, dat er wel degelijke redenen zijn voor de
Esperantobeweging om uit haar schulp te kruipen en zich zeer actief te
blijven interesseren, niet alleen voor de VN, maar voor alle grote
supra-nationale organisaties.

<H2>
Welke talen in de Europese Unie?
</H2>
Wat het aantal sprekers betreft behoort het Nederlands tot de "kleine"
talen van Europa. Er zijn vijf grote en zes kleine talen. Waar de norm ligt
voor een grote taal en wie die norm heeft vastgesteld, is niet zo
duidelijk. Daar het Nederlands door zo'n 20 miljoen sprekers wordt
gesproken, zal de norm wel ergens rond dat cijfer draaien. Maar die norm is
vreemd, want Portugees - dat door ruim 160 miljoen Brazilianen wordt
gesproken - hoort bij de kleine talen, omdat hun land toevallig geen deel
uitmaakt van de Europese Unie.
<P>
Nochtans zou men ook andere normen kunnen hanteren, zoals het aantal landen
waar een taal als moedertaal wordt gesproken, of, waarom niet, de
financi&#235;le inbreng die een taalgemeenschap doet in het Europees budget. Ook
het aantal telefoonlijnen per inwoner, km autoweg, aantal kranten of
boekhandels, kortom alles kan als norm gebruikt worden.
<P>
Maar goed, democratie werkt nu eenmaal met aantallen mensen, dus laat ons
het aantal sprekers als norm maar aanvaarden, en laat ons de grens van 20
miljoen als norm ook aanvaarden.
<P>
Talentellingen zijn echter een delicaat probleem. Vlamingen staan daar niet
voor niets huiverig tegenover, want je kan er alle kanten mee uit. Je kan
je positie in de top tien van grootste talen er zelfs positief mee
be&#239;nvloeden.
<P>
In de Franstalige bijlage bij <I>Franca Esperantisto</I>
1996/5, p. 62 verscheen de volgende telling:
<UL>
<LI>1ste plaats het Duits, met 80,9 miljoen sprekers in Duitsland en 7,9
miljoen in Oostenrijk; 16 % van de leerlingen in de EU leren Duits.
<LI>2de plaats het Frans met 57,5 miljoen sprekers in Frankrijk en 5 miljoen
Walen. 32,2 % van de leerlingen in de EU leren Frans.
<LI>3de plaats het Engels met 58 miljoen Britten en 3,5 miljoen Ieren. 83 % van
de leerlingen in de EU leren Engels.
</UL>
Het is duidelijk dat de 2de en de 3de plaats krap zijn, hier is een
fotofinish noodzakelijk.
<P>
Voor het Frans tellen we 57,5 + 5 = 62,5 miljoen;
voor het Engels: 58 + 3,5 = 61,5 miljoen.
<P>
Wie iets weet over taalverhoudingen in Belgi&#235; weet echter dat de bevolking
opsplitsen in 50 % Frans-, 50 % Nederlandstaligen een zeer ruwe schatting
is. 40-60 in het nadeel van het Frans is een betere benadering. Maar die 10
% is meteen ook goed voor 1 miljoen sprekers. Trek van 62,5 miljoen 1
miljoen af en Frans en Engels eindigen ex aequo. En zoals in het voetbal waar in
dat geval het aantal gewonnen matchen doorslaggevend is in het klassement,
kan men ook hier een tweede norm hanteren: het aantal leerlingen dat de
taal als tweede taal leert. Als we dat doen, moet het Frans vrede nemen met
de bronzen medaille. Meedoen is uiteindelijk belangrijker dan winnen!
<P>
Dat het Duits zijn leiderspositie niet kan omzetten in een grotere
gebruikswinst, is een ander argument dat de hele taalpolitiek in de EU op
de helling zet.
<P>
En het Esperanto? Natuurlijk is het Esperanto een kleine taal. Behalve een
ontelbaar aantal sprekers - ontelbaar, want zij wonen niet bijeen in een
ghetto - is het nergens nationale taal, is het van niemand eerste taal,
zelfs niet bij "denaskaj", mensen die van bij de geboorte in het Esperanto
zijn opgevoed. Maar het Esperanto is ook groot: het is eenduidig, kent geen
uitzonderingen, is economisch gezien de beste koop als je de
prijs/kwaliteit verhouding in overweging neemt, het heeft een hoog
rendement - bij gelijke inspanning bij de studie, ligt de opbrengst in
communicatieve vaardigheid beduidend hoger dan bij etnische talen, verder
heeft het bewezen propedeutische eigenschappen, het is volksverheffend,
geestverruimend, grensverleggend, cultuuroverstijgend en -ondersteunend,
het vormt geen bedreiging voor etnische talen, het is meer dan de televisie
een open venster op de wereld, want het brengt mensen rechtstreeks met
elkaar in contact zonder de selectieve tussenkomst van een cameralens, een
cineast of een journalist.<BR>

Naalden in de hooiberg

<H2>Naalden in de hooiberg</H2>
Het boek van Umberto Eco, <I> Europa en de volmaakte taal </I>,
is met grote belangstelling in de Esperantowereld ontvangen, niet in
het minst, omdat Eco, tijdens het schrijven van dit boek, zich ook in het
Esperanto heeft verdiept en zich a.h.w. tot het Esperanto heeft bekeerd.
Misschien is dat wat sterk uitgedrukt, maar hij heeft toch zijn
oorspronkelijke sceptische oordeel verlaten, en is de mening toegedaan dat
het Esperanto inderdaad een heel grote waarde heeft en ruimschoots de
verwachtingen kan inlossen die het schept en het doel dat het nastreeft kan
realiseren - tenminste zuiver taalkundig bekeken. Maar waarover gaat het
boek?
<P>
Eco gaat op zoek naar alle pogingen die - sinds Babel - ondernomen zijn om
de mens opnieuw &#233;&#233;n taal te bezorgen.
Maar reeds hier rijst een eerste
twistpunt. Is de taalverscheidenheid wel met Babel ontstaan? Een analyse
van het Bijbelverhaal en een voorafgaand hoofdstuk leert dat er reeds
v&#243;&#243;r
Babel taalverscheidenheid was. Waarom wordt er dan toch altijd aan Babel
gerefereerd? Klaarblijkelijk interpreteerde men de taaldifferentiatie
v&#243;&#243;r
Babel als het ontstaan van tribale dialecten, terwijl de gebeurtenissen bij
Babel veroorzaakt werden door een goddelijke vloek.
<P>
Hoewel deze Bijbelse tegenstrijdigheid aanleiding geeft tot enige
discussie, houdt ze onderzoekers niet tegen om op zoek te gaan naar de
&quot;perfekte&quot;
taal. Aanvankelijk gaat het om de zoektocht naar de
eerste/oorspronkelijke taal, later om pogingen om een universele en
perfecte taal te construeren. Het boek behandelt dus de geschiedenis van
het zoeken naar die universele taal, vooral toegespitst op wat men in de
Middeleeuwen en tijdens de Renaissance op dat vlak heeft gerealiseerd.
<P>
De zoektocht van de mensheid naar de universele en perfecte taal begint
eigenlijk met de zoektocht naar de Eerste taal. Welke taal heeft Adam in
het Aards Paradijs gesproken. Daarbij komt de bovenvermelde
tegenstrijdigheid aan het licht, maar wordt ook duidelijk hoe de
interpretatie van die verhalen en het denken over de aard van die eerste
taal geleidelijk evolueert. Eerst heerst de opvatting dat Adam een
volledige taal heeft gekregen. Daarna maakt de stelling opgang dat hij niet
een taal kreeg, maar het vermogen tot taal, de mogelijkheid om de dingen te
benoemen en zo een taal uit te bouwen.
<P>
Geleidelijk aan dwaalt dit zoeken van de eerste taal echter af.
Godsdienstige overwegingen krijgen meer en meer de nadruk en &quot;de eerste
taal&quot; wordt stilaan de taal tussen de mens, in casu de priesters, en God.
Daardoor krijgt de &quot;perfecte taal&quot; stilaan de status van
&quot;geheime taal&quot;. Op
die manier kan de priesterklasse zich een superieure status en de
daarbijhorende macht toe&#235;igenen. Als
&quot;geheime taal&quot; wordt ze echter ook
bruikbaar in de politiek. Van godsdienst verschuift de zoektocht naar het
politieke vlak.
<P>
De godsdienstige &quot;universele&quot;
taal had echter ook de bedoeling om correct
met God te communiceren. Dit aspect van de taal eigenen zich de filosofen
toe. Hen gaat het er daarbij niet meer om om correct met God te
communiceren, maar om correct, logisch en
&#233;&#233;nduidig te denken en de
gedachten in taal vast te leggen. Deze filosofische taal krijgt meer en
meer een wiskundige inslag. Ze wordt sterk symbolisch en krijgt ook de
functie van brugtaal. Een tekst uit
&#233;&#233;n taal, zou via de sterk formele (en
dus niet spreekbare) taal perfect in een andere taal kunnen worden
overgezet. Deze matematische taal maakt gebruik van symbolen, cijfers enz.
zodat ze niet als een in de dagelijkse omgang bruikbaar communicatiemiddel
kan worden beschouwd. Denken wordt gelijkgesteld met rekenen en alles
wordt dan ook in wiskundige symbolen vastgelegd. Deze projecten liggen aan
de basis van de huidige zoektocht naar vertalen via de computer.
<P>
Het bespreken van alle afzonderlijke projecten heeft geen zin, daarvoor
moet men het boek zelf lezen. Maar enkele krachtlijnen uit het boek
presenteren is wel de moeite waard. Wat eerst en vooral opvalt, is dat veel
van wat als moderne idee&#235;n wordt beschouwd, reeds in de Middeleeuwen aan
bod kwam. Verder valt het op hoe vele van de principes van woord- en
zinsbouw (morfologie en grammatica), die als universeel in het denken
naar voren werden geschoven, in het Esperanto hun toepassing vinden. Uit
deze geschiedenis blijkt echter ook hoe de wereld geleidelijk aan steeds
complexer wordt, de wetenschappelijke verfijning steeds groter, en de
mogelijkheden om heel die complexiteit in taal te vatten steeds moeilijker.
Zo wordt de mogelijkheid van een universele taal steeds minder voor de
handliggend.
<P>
Het uitgangspunt van Eco is trouwens ook dat veeltaligheid een essentieel
en typisch kenmerk van Europa is. De spanning tussen cultureel egocentrisme
enerzijds en drang naar universalisme, eucumene en vrede zijn daarvan de
belangrijkste karakteristieken.
<P>
Tenslotte nog twee punten om deze bespreking af te ronden. De
oorspronkelijk zoektocht naar de universele taal vertrok vanuit het geloof
dat de mensheid ooit
&#233;&#233;n taal heeft gesproken. De hedendaagse zoektocht
naar een universele taal is veel pragmatischer en gericht op de toekomst.
De noodzaak om boodschappen tot ver in het nageslacht - duizenden en
duizenden jaren lang - te bewaren, dwingt de mensheid als het ware zo'n
taal te ontwerpen. Het voorbeeld van het gebied waar de Amerikanen hun
kernproeven hebben uitgevoerd en dat voor tienduizende jaren
levensgevaarlijk radio-actief besmet is, is daarvoor exemplarisch. Niet
alleen de waarschuwing doorgeven, maar vooral ze ook doorgeven in een vorm
die ook voor wezens die onze culturele achtergrond niet hebben - b.v.
buitenaardse wezens - lijkt een onoverkomelijk probleem, omdat wij onszelf
nu eenmaal niet los kunnen maken van onze culturele eigenheden. En omdat
stappen of principes die voor ons logisch zijn, niet
<I>an sich</I> logisch
zijn. Ze behoren toe aan en systeem en men kan ze enkel logisch begrijpen
als men het systeem kent. Maar hoe kan men de kennis van dat systeem
doorgeven?
<P>
Laat ik nog even stilstaan bij de vraag of Eco aan het Esperanto zijn zegen
geeft. Ongetwijfeld besteedt hij ruime aandacht aan het fenomeen Esperanto
en beoordeelt hij het erg positief. Maar Eco is een wetenschapper. Zijn
zoektocht naar pogingen en realistaties om een universele taal te
ontwerpen, lijken doorheen gans het werk het utopische van de idee te
onderlijnen. Wel is het jammer dat door slordigheden - gedeeltelijk in de
vertaling, maar ook enkele van Eco zelf - nogal wat fouten in de
Esperanto-voorbeelden voorkomen.

Het spook bestookt
</H2>
Toen Brutus, na de moord op Caesar, het Romeinse volk toesprak, zei hij -
aldus Shakespeare - ongeveer het volgende: ``Het volledige dossier rond zijn
dood berust nu bij het parlement. Daarin zijn zijn goede kanten, waarvoor
hij achting verdient, niet verdoezeld, en evenmin zijn zijn misdaden,
waarvoor hij werd gedood, overdreven.'' Iets gelijkaardigs kunnen we zeggen
over het Esperanto in <I>Esperanto, Een kritische kijk op de Internationale
Taal</I>. Dat geeft een presentatie waarin de mooie en waardevolle kanten van
het Esperanto volledig tot hun recht komen; maar evenmin is het blind voor
de gebreken en het falen. De balans wordt positief gewaardeerd (``een
definitieve aanwinst voor de wereldcultuur''), en de hoop hoeft niet te
worden opgegeven.
<P>
Het boek biedt in zekere zin alles - behalve een kant en klare cursus. Het
schetst de maatschappelijke positie van het Esperanto en wijst op de
discrepantie tussen zijn universele waarde (verdraagzaam, progressief,
democratisch, ...) en het negatieve imago dat de taal/beweging bij het
grote publiek heeft.
<P>
Het geeft een overzicht over het denken rond plantalen en de positie van
het Esperanto tussen andere als primus inter pares (eerste tussen
gelijken).
<P>
Ook de geschiedenis van de beweging komt aan bod, met ruime belangstelling
- dat hoeft vanuit het Masereelfonds niet te verwonderen - voor de bloei en
het verval van het arbeidersesperantisme zoals die vooral tot uiting komt
in de geschiedenis van SAT (Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda) en de vervolgingen
precies in de communistische Sovjet Unie.
<P>
De taal zelf wordt niet uit het oog verloren: de structuur en de
grammatische principes worden grondig uiteengezet. En de lezer krijgt ook
een overzicht van de literatuur, zowel vertalingen als origineel.
<P>
En natuurlijk heeft de auteur ook aandacht voor het educatieve: hoe is het
onderwijs in het Esperanto gestructureerd. Waar kan je het leren. Waar
wordt het bestudeerd.
<P>
Ten slotte gaat hij ook dieper in op dat negatieve imago dat telkens weer
als een spook achter het woord Esperanto opdoemt. De redenen daarvoor zijn
legio: psychologische argwaan, valse informatie, taal-bescherming,
onwetendheid. Een oproep om vooroordeel te ruilen voor oordeel na
gefundeerde kennisname van het fenomeen sluit dit hoofdstuk af.
<P>
En dan zijn er de conclusies waarin de hoofdtoon is: de weg is nog lang,
maar de taal is levend.
<P>
De bibliografie geeft aan het boek een extra wetenschappelijke dimensie en
de adressen van UEA en FEL achterin zorgen ervoor dat de lezer als hij wil,
meteen de volgende stap kan zetten.
<P>
<I>Esperanto, Een kritische kijk...</I>
is een bijzonder waardevol middel in de
kruistocht naar een verdere doorbraak, omwille van zijn evenwichtige
presentatie en omdat het werd uitgegeven door een stichting geheel buiten
de Esperantowereld. Daardoor zal het wellicht vlotter zijn weg naar de
gewone boekhandel en het doelpubliek vinden. Esperantosprekers, die er
weliswaar niets nieuws uit zullen leren, kunnen er baat bij hebben om hun
argumentatie te voordele van de taal bij te spijkeren. Toch is het boek
vooral bedoeld voor een publiek dat nog steeds bang is voor spoken.

Esperanto-CD in Spaanse top 10</H2>
Sinds enkele weken klinkt op de radio in heel Spanje een EsperantoCD
uitgegeven door Warner Music Spain.  De CD werd in verscheidene landen
tegelijkertijd gelanceerd.  Hij bevat 10 bekende melodien - o.a.  Odo al la
ojo (Het Vredeslied, de Europese Hymne) van Beethoven.  De liederen werden
door verschillende koren uitgevoerd en opgenomen o.a.  in Bulgarije, Cuba en
Rusland.  In het begeleidend tekstboekje zijn de teksten in zeven talen
opgenomen.  Jammer genoeg wordt er niet in vermeld wat de oorspronkelijke tekst
is, wie voor de vertaling tekent en welke koren welke liederen uitvoeren.
<P>Vanuit artistiek standpunt is deze CD zeker geen hoogvlieger.  De potische
kracht van de tekst is zwak (in eender welke taal) en ook de uitvoering is erg
vlak, wat nog wordt versterkt door de electronische begeleiding.  Toch heeft
het voor het Esperanto een positieve kant.  De taal wordt op grote schaal aan
de buitenwereld gepresenteerd, en het geheel is het werk van een
buitenstaander, nietEsperantospreker.  Slechts in beperkte mate hebben
Esperantosprekers hun medewerking kunnen verlenen.  Wij kunnen deze inspanning
enkel belonen door de CD in onze boekhandel te koop aan te bieden.  De prijs
zal ca.  750 fr.  bedragen.<BR> gvd

Nieuwe Biologische Nomenclatuur</H2>

Zaterdag 26 oktober 1996 werd in Kalmthout een Feestdronk gehouden
ter gelegenheid van de 25ste verjaardag van de "Vereniging voor het
Invoeren van de Nieuwe Biologische Nomenclatuur".  Die verjaardag
werd ook gevierd in Praag tijdens het Esperantowereldcongres in
internationale kring en aan het Universitair Centrum Antwerpen met
een lezing in het auditorium B103 op vrijdag 25 oktober 1996 in een
milieu van wetenschappers.

<H4>
Wat is NBN?
</H4>

Nieuwe Biologische Nomenclatuur (NBN) is een speciaal systeem voor de
benaming van dieren, planten, e.a., dat gebruik maakt van woorden uit
de internationale taal Esperanto.  Het is een volkomen
wetenschappelijk systeem met zijn eigen regels, die stellen dat elke
NBNnaam, informatief, correct, exclusief en orinterend zou zijn.

<P>

Elke NBNnaam is bijgevolg iets volkomen nieuws.  Iemand heeft die
naam bedacht op grond van de NBNregels, naderhand hebben drie
biologen die naam beoordeeld en tenslotte heeft het bestuur van de
Vereniging voor het Invoeren van Nieuwe Biologische Nomenclatuur hem,
samen met andere, geofficialiseerd en dit daarna gepubliceerd in een
"Beslissing".

<P>

Elke NBNnaam heeft daarenboven zijn identificatienummer en zijn
speciale aanduiding in een numeraal systeem.  Een NBNnaam wordt
aangeduid tussen twee asterisken.

<P>

In augustus 1996 waren er al meer dan 2200 NBNnamen
geofficialiseerd, dit dank zij meer dan 150 Beslissingen.

<P>

De Vereniging heeft reeds tal van boeken uitgegeven:  Informerende:
Kennismaking met Nieuwe Biologische Nomenclatuur (ook in Engels en
Esperanto); Orinterende (Lexicon NBNnamen 1500 en 5011000 en een
Repertorium van NBNnamen 11400); tenslotte ook Documenterende:
Beslissingen (6 delen).  Deze boeken zijn te koop op de zetel van de
vereniging:  Hertendreef 12, B2920 Kalmthout of in de boekhandel van de
<A HREF="mailto:fel@knooppunt.be">Vlaamse Esperantobond</A>.

<P>

Door een nmalige bijdrage van 500,- fr.  of 25,- gld.  kan u
levenslang lid worden van de vereniging.  Ze heeft leden in meer dan
50 landen.  Uw lidmaatschap is een morele steun voor de idee dat in
de biologie een meer logische vorm van nomenclatuur zijn diensten zou
kunnen verlenen aan de wetenschappers van de 21ste eeuw en dat deze
nieuwe vorm de internationale taal Esperanto aanwendt in plaats van
Latijn en Grieks.

Pozie: de ziel van het Esperanto</H2>
<I>Sta me toe als dichter mijn mening te geven over de rijkdom of het
gebrek daaraan van het Esperanto.  Eerst en vooral, een kunsttaal kan
heel nuttig zijn in </I>geconstrueerde<I> teksten over ideologische
of technische onderwerpen, maar geinspireerde pozie of literatuur
moet uit de ziel van de dichter vloeien en wordt gewoonlijk veel
spontaner gevormd in de moedertaal van de auteur, in zoverre zelfs
dat de Engelse teksten van overzeese dichters allemaal vertalingen
zijn uit de originele taal (het Bengaals, bijvoorbeeld in het geval
van Tagore).  <P> Bijgevolg is een verworven kunsttaal mentaal niet
geschikt voor de schepper, hoe groot zijn objectieve verdiensten ook
mogen zijn.  En, omdat dichters nu nmaal een publiek zoeken, zullen
zij liever in die taal schrijven die door het grootst mogelijk
publiek wordt begrepen, in plaats van uw ideaal te onderschrijven,
hoe waardevol dat ook is!  <BR> David Stringer, 1996 <P> </I>De
mening die hierboven wordt geciteerd is helemaal niet ongewoon.  Met
betrekking tot het Esperanto klopt die theorie van geen kanten, maar
het is de moeite waard de argumentatie ervan te analyseren ten einde
aan te tonen waarom de theorie - ondanks het feit dat ze op het
eerste gezicht erg waarschijnlijk is - toch verkeerd is.  <P> Eerst
en vooral maakt ze een empirische fout [in Belgi zou je het een
procedurefout kunnen noemen (red.)], omdat ze geen kennis neemt van
de bloeiende Esperantodichtkunst in de laatste honderd jaar - hoewel
Stringer zich met een minimum aan goed onderzoek daarover had kunnen
informeren.  In mijn eigen bibliotheek bevinden zich op dit ogenblik
meer dan driehonderd dichtbundels, uit vijf continenten, allemaal
origineel in het Esperanto gecreerd en niet vertaald uit een andere
taal.  (Ook de vertaalde pozie bloeit trouwens - van Chaucer tot
Matsuo Bash - maar dat is een zaak apart.)  <P> Het is wat goedkoop
om te stellen dat die gedichten helemaal geen gedichten zijn, als je
niet eens de moeite neemt om er zelfs maar kennis van te nemen.  Maar
om dat te kunnen doen, moet men ten minste een klein beetje Esperanto
leren.  Het is veel gemakkelijker ze gewoon af te wijzen, als niet
bestaande te beschouwen.  <P> Het is een feit dat niet alle
Esperantodichters even competent zijn - en om heel eerlijk te zijn er
zijn er zelfs compleet waardeloze, maar ik durf beweren dat er ook
een aantal van wereldformaat tussen zitten.  Natuurlijk worden die
niet erkend buiten de Esperantogemeenschap, maar het zelfde geldt
over het algemeen voor de grote Hongaarse dichters, wier reputatie de
meesten onder ons maar voor waar moeten aannemen.  In mijn eigen land
geldt dat ook voor de Gaelische dichters zoals Somhairle en
MacGillEain.  Wij accepteren hun reputatie omdat competente sprekers
van de betrokken talen ons zeggen dat ze "buitengewoon" zijn.
Esperantodichters worden zelden met dezelfde voorkomendheid
behandeld.  <P> Esperantodichters bestaan, maar hoe kan dat?  <P> De
argumentatie van Stringer is perfect valabel wanneer die wordt
toegepast op vreemde (etnische) talen, maar met betrekking tot het
Esperanto gaat ze niet op.  De reden daarvan is dat Esperanto geen
vreemde taal is in de echte zin van het woord.  Een vreemde taal is
het eigendom van moedertaalsprekers, die die taal naijverig
bemoederen en voeden.  Wanneer ik Frans probeer te spreken, dan ben
ik mij volkomen bewust van het onoverkomelijk gewicht van de Franse
cultuur, die tegenover mij staat opgesteld.  Ik weet dat ik nooit in
staat zal zijn heel die cultuur te assimileren en dat ik me nooit
echt thuis zal voelen in die Franse cultuur.  <P> Evenmin vermindert
mijn liefde voor het Esperanto mijn liefde voor het Engels.  Dat is
de reden waarom mijn haren ten bergen rijzen wanneer ik buitenlanders
mijn moedertaal hoor verkrachten, wat zij onvermijdelijk doen,
wanneer zij Engels proberen te spreken.  Maar dat gaat niet op voor
het Esperanto, dat aan iedereen toebehoort, zowel aan nieuwelingen
als aan mensen die met Esperanto werden opgevoed van bij de geboorte.
Er is hier geen onoverkomelijk gewicht.  Ik zeg soms - al schertsend
weliswaar - dat het Esperanto mijn taal is, omdat ik die zelf gekozen
heb, terwijl het Engels mij willens nillens werd opgedrongen.  Maar
er zit een grond van waarheid in die scherts.  <P> Er bestaat geen
conflict tussen het Esperanto en iemands moedertaal; beide kunnen
comfortabel coexisteren in n psyche.  Dat komt, omdat die talen
twee afzonderlijke en gescheiden rollen vervullen, waaraan zij
perfect zijn aangepast.  Engels is niet bij uitstek geschikt voor
internationaal gebruik en vervult die functie slechts met beperkt
succes.  (Maar dit wil ik terzijde laten, want het raakt slechts
zijdelings het onderwerp van dit essay.  Of iedereen het hierover
eens is, heeft hier geen belang.)  <P> Het andere onderscheid tussen
Esperanto enerzijds en andere talen anderzijds is dat Esperanto een
"kunsttaal" is.  Dit wordt vaak denigrerend opgemerkt, maar dat komt
omdat men de term "kunsttaal" verkeerd begrijpt.  "Kunsttaal"
betekent eigenlijk dat Esperanto een "kunstwerk" is, de creatie van
een kunstenaar, van een dichter in de ware zin van het woord.  En
zoals elk ander kunstwerk werkt het verlichtend, dat is de reden
waarom het Esperanto zoveel dichters inspireert.  <P> <B>Mentaal
geschikt</B> <P> We moeten nu bekijken of een aangeleerde kunsttaal
"mentaal geschikt is voor een schepper".  De idee van Stringer over
het creatieve proces is honderd procent correct.  Wat hij en vele
anderen zich niet kunnen voorstellen - door hun bevooroordeelde
misvatting van zijn ware aard - is dat het Esperanto in iemands geest
kan worden geassimileerd en dat het daar als taal wortel kan
schieten.  Maar het kan, en het gebeurt.  Als Esperantodichter kan ik
zeggen:  Het is mij overkomen.  <P> Een groot deel van mijn leven heb
ik gesleten in Esperantokringen.  Esperanto is niet mijn tweede taal,
maar mijn eerste vreemde taal.  Met velen van mijn vrienden - en ook
wel met vijanden - heb ik - tenzij uit beleefdheid tegenover derden -
nooit Engels gesproken, zelfs al is Engels hun moedertaal.  Het is
natuurlijker - let op het woord - de taal te gebruiken waarin de
gemeenschappelijke ervaringen werden beleefd.  (Onder deze vrienden
is mijn jeugdvriend, getuige bij mijn huwelijk en regelmatige
correspondentievriend gedurende een halve eeuw.)  En dat geldt <I>a
fortiori</I> voor vrienden of vijanden wier moedertaal niet het
Engels is.  <P> Nu moet je niet denken dat dit enkel geldt voor mij
en een handvol andere fanatici.  Natuurlijk zijn er heel wat
Esperantosprekers die niet tot dit uiterste zijn gegaan, maar er zijn
er een heleboel die het wel doen, overal ter wereld, en onder hen
bevinden zich natuurlijk de dichters.  <P> Want Esperanto is de
uitdrukking van een filosofie en een kijk op het leven, of men dat nu
wil of niet.  Zijn uitgangspunten veronderstellen het aanvaarden van
de fundamentele gelijkheid van de mensen en een gemeenschappelijk
idee over menswaardigheid.  Dit wordt wel eens als naief afgedaan,
maar het heeft grote denkers, heiligen en rabbies genspireerd en het
is veruit te verkiezen boven het harteloze chauvinisme van dictators
en boven de wrede razernij van wat eufemistisch "etnische zuivering"
wordt genoemd.  <P> Tijdens het eerste Esperanto-Wereldcongres nam
Zamenhof het woord en zei:  "...  voor de eerste keer in de
geschiedenis van de mensheid staan wij, leden van verschillende
volkeren, naast elkaar, niet als concurrenten, maar als broeders,
die, zonder n taal aan anderen op te dringen, elkaar begrijpen,
zonder wantrouwen ter wille van het duister dat verdeelt, in liefde
applaudiserend, niet schijnheilig, zoals leden van verschillende
naties doen, maar oprecht, van mens tot mens."  Deze woorden mogen
nooit worden vergeten.  Dat is de visie die de Esperantobeweging
heeft gemotiveerd en zijn grootste dichters heeft genspireerd.  <P>
<B>De meest individuele emotie</B> <P> Toen in 1906 de echtgenote van
de Rus Roman Frenkel werd gedood door een onbekende hand, verkoos hij
zijn verdriet om haar uit te drukken in een gedicht in het Esperanto.
Dit fenomeen keert keer op keer terug in Esperantokringen.  Want taal
is nu eenmaal een emotionele aangelegenheid, en dat geldt evenzeer
voor het Esperanto als voor andere talen.  En alle kunst groeit eerst
en vooral uit emotie.  <P> Dichters zijn per definitie ook
"woordsmeden" wier creatieve werkmiddelen woorden zijn.  Het is
wellicht moeilijk voor Stringer om te begrijpen dat Esperanto geen
steriele code of een ongelukkig jargon is, maar een taal vol
subtiliteiten (wanneer ze volledig geabsorbeerd en gebruikt wordt) en
ingeboren suggestie.  Maar het is zo.  In tegenstelling tot de
ruimverspreide opvatting is het Esperanto geen surrogaat
IndoEuropese taal, maar heeft het zijn eigen en unieke structuur.
Zamenhof maakt dat duidelijk in zijn <I>Unua Libro</I>:  "Maar omdat
dit soort taalconstructie zo ongewoon is voor de volkeren in Europa
en omdat het moeilijk voor hen zou zijn om daaraan te wennen, heb ik
de bedoelde segmenten van de taal aangepast aan de geest van de
Europese talen, zodanig dat iemand die mijn taal leert zonder deze
inleiding - die helemaal niet noodzakelijk is voor de student - niet
eens door heeft dat het constructiepatroon van deze taal helemaal
verschilt van dat van zijn moedertaal."  <P> Esperanto is
fundamenteel agglutinerend.  Om maar n voorbeeld te noemen van wat
het Esperanto zo subtiel maakt:  het feit dat elke stam gebruikt kan
worden als werkwoord, zelfstandig naamwoord, bijvoeglijk naamwoord of
bijwoord geeft aan de taal een grote grammatische flexibiliteit en
een subtiele betekenisleer.  Het is een opwindend medium voor de
creatieve gedachte en de dichtkunst.  <P> Stringer wordt echter nog
meer misleid door een andere paradox:  de grootte van het
lezerspubliek.  Hij veronderstelt dat het potentile wereldwijde
lezerspubliek van het Engels zo enorm groot is, dat onvermijdelijk
het actuele publiek van een bepaald auteur die van welke
Esperantoauteur verre moet overtreffen.  Maar is dat altijd het
geval?  Het is ongetwijfeld waar in het geval van fictie-bestsellers.
Maar is het ook waar voor pozie?  Slechts weinig Engelse pozie
wordt gedrukt in een oplage die groter is dan enkele honderd
exemplaren.  Ik heb ergens gelezen dat de eerste druk van Eliots "The
Waste Land" slechts 500 exemplaren bedroeg.  Mijn eerste boek werd op
2000 exemplaren gedrukt en was binnen het jaar uitverkocht.
Natuurlijk, "The Waste Land" klom steeds hoger en hoger, maar ook
mijn boek kende meerdere herdrukken.  Maar het werkelijke
lezerspubliek van de meeste nieuwe Engelse pozie is zeker niet
groter dan het werkelijke publiek van nieuwe Esperantodichters.  <P>
En die hebben de zekerheid van een wereldwijde verspreiding.  Als ik
door de wereld reis, kom ik mensen tegen die mijn werk kennen.  Ik
heb een Roemeen ontmoet die n van mijn bundels lyrische gedichten
van buiten kent.  In Peking werd ik door een Chinees in een toespraak
verwelkomd waaruit bleek dat hij mijn volledig oeuvre zeer goed
kende.  In mijn post zitten brieven met gelukwensen uit heel de
wereld, inclusief Mongoli.  Wat kan een dichter meer wensen?  <P>

Des winters als het regent...</H2>

Klaarblijkelijk moet er van de grijze luchten, waarvoor Nederland zo
gekend is, iets inspirerends uitgaan voor muziekminnende
Esperantosprekers, want na Kajto is er een tweede groep geboren die
kwaliteitsproducten aflevert.  Akordo, een groepje van zeven, heeft
inderdaad een eerste CD op de markt gebracht.  Hij heet
<I>Muzikpluvo</I> (Muziekregen) en bevat 11 liederen uit de
Middeleeuwen en 14 volksliederen, waarvan sommige reeds geruime tijd
tot het repertoire van de Esperantozangcultuur behoren.  <P> De
groep is pas enkele jaren actief (eerste optreden in 1989), maar trad
reeds verscheidene malen op o.a.  tijdens het 1ste Europees
Esperantocongres in Parijs (1995) en tijdens het 81ste
Esperanto-Wereldcongres in Praag (1996).  Ook wie vorig jaar de
feestzitting ter gelegenheid van 25 jaar Esperantocursus aan de
Stedelijke Avondleergangen van Antwerpen bijwoonde, kon hen aan het
werk horen.  De leden van de groep zijn bijna allemaal doorwinterde
esperantisten die in de Nederlandse Jongerenbeweging hun sporen
hebben verdiend.  <P> In de rubriek "Onze Taal" van
<I>Horizontaal</I>, 1996/5, blz.  1 kon je de mooie vertaling van het
lied "Merk toch hoe sterk" vergelijken met de originele Nederlandse
tekst.  In de begeleidende tekst werd besproken welke moeilijkheden
de vertaler had ondervonden, hoe hij die heeft ondervangen en waarom
hij dat zo heeft gedaan.  Wellicht ben je het met mij eens dat het
resultaat er mocht zijn.  Dat lied kan je een beetje beschouwen als
de scharnier van de CD die in twee delen uiteen valt:  Het eerste
deel bevat klassieke oude muziekstukken uit de 16de eeuw.  Je vindt
er componisten zoals Hans Leo Hassler, Giovanni Pierluigi da
Palestrina en Olando di Lasso, en ook het frivole <I>Mi ne povas
diri</I> (Je ne l'ose dire) en het drinklied Turdiono.  <P> Het
tweede deel zijn vooral volksmelodien uit alle hoeken van de
(Westerse) wereld:  Wales, Hongarije, Kroati, Bosni, de Verenigde
Staten en ZuidAfrika, met Kenia als vreemde eend in de bijt.  Deze
samenstelling maakt de CD een echt internationaal product.  Voor de
vertalingen kon de groep buiten op het talent uit eigen omgeving ook
rekenen op de hulp van tal van gekende namen uit de internationale
Esperantowereld.  <P> De liederen worden allemaal <I>a capella</I>,
dus zonder instrumentale begeleiding gebracht.  De frisse volheid van
de verschillende stemmen die goed bij elkaar passen en elkaar mooi
aanvullen, zorgen voor een evenwichtige en volle klank.  Is het omdat
de eerste liederen mij bekend in de oren klinken, is het omdat
sommige van die liederen door wereldvermaarde componisten zijn
geschreven en dus sowieso muzikaal veel sterker zijn, naar mijn
gevoel is het eerste deel van de CD beter.  Het koor schijnt die
werken ook beter te beheersen.  Naar het einde toe zwakt de
kwaliteit, of vooral de overtuiging en het enthoesiasme wat af.  Dat

<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Tolkien en Decamerone in het Esperanto </TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <H2>
<IMG SRC="gif/logo_kl1.gif" ALT="Vlaamse Esperantobond"> Tolkien en Decamerone in het
Esperanto </H2> <H3>
Vroeg of laat in vertaling </H3>
Tegenstanders van het Esperanto
komen steevast met het argument aandragen dat die taal geen literaire cultuur
heeft.  Voorstanders bieden weerwerk door te stellen dat die cultuur er wel is,
zowel in originele werken, als in vertalingen van relatief kleine
cultuurgebieden als van de wereldliteratuur.  Nu is het aanbod van vertaalde
wereldliteratuur natuurlijk niet te vergelijken met wat je daarvan in
Nederlandse vertaling kan lezen.  Het Esperanto leidt nu eenmaal aan het euvel
van een beperkte en mondiaal uitgestrekte markt.  Toch breidt het aantal werken
uit de wereldliteratuur zich gestaag uit.
<P>
Onlangs is het aanbod weer met twee belangrijke werken uitgebreid.  Het eerste
is het reeds eerder aangekondigde tweede deel van Tolkiens trilogie <I>La
mastro de l' ringoj</I>.  Na het succes van het eerste deel, <I>La Kunularo de
l' Ringo</I>, waarvan een recensie verscheen in <I>Horizontaal</I> (1996/2, p.
9) en dat intussen reeds volledig uitverkocht is, houdt de uitgave van <I>La du
turegoj</I> geen risico in.  De vertaling is uiteraard ook van William Auld en
die naam staat voor kwaliteit.  Het werk is heel populair en kent een zeer
uitgebreid lezerspubliek.  De feerieke en imaginaire wereld spreekt
klaarblijkelijk bij velen tot de verbeelding en sluit dicht aan bij de vele
figuren uit de hedendaagse computeranimatie en stripwereld.  Daarenboven heeft
Tolkien een soort fanclub wier leden alles wat Tolkien betreft aankopen.  Dat
is uiteraard een met plezier meegenomen voordeel.  Op die manier komt het
Esperantoboek ook eens buiten zijn traditionele markt.

<P>De tweede vertaling stamt uit de Italiaanse literatuur van de middeleeuwen.
De Decamerone van Boccaccio ligt mee aan de bron van de moderne literatuur.  De
vertaling is van de hand van Giulio Cappa, Perla Martinelli en wijlen Gaston
Waringhien.  Deze namen waarborgen de kwaliteit van het geleverde werk.

De <I>Decamerone</I> is het verhaal van een groepje Florentijnse edellieden,
van beider kunne, die zich - om de pest te ontvluchten - terugtrekken in een
villa buiten.  Om de tijd te doden vertellen ze elkaar verhalen:  fabels,
legenden, anekdoten...  De meeste zijn erotisch getint, soms tegen het
schunnige af, maar realistisch en vaak humoristisch.  Het werk komt als zeer
vrij over, vooral omdat de auteur de directe confrontatie met de heersende
moraal omzeilt.

<P>Niet het volledige werk is vertaald, slechts de eerste drie dagen.  Maar, in
tegenstelling tot vele vertalingen in nationale talen die slechts een keure uit
de verhalen aanbieden, volgt deze vertaling wel getrouw de chronologie en
volgorde van de oorspronkelijke tekst.  Dat opent perspectieven voor een
uitgave van het vervolg.

<P>De stijl van de vertaling is aangepast aan het middeleeuwse kader.  Dat
resulteert in topzware zinnen, met veel opeenstapelingen van deelwoorden.
Daardoor wordt het lezen niet echt gemakkelijk.  Hier en daar wordt de sfeer
echter verstoord door het gebruik van te modern Esperanto, zoals het gebruik
van <I>far</I> (door) of <I>mi belas kaj inas</I> (ik ben mooi en vrouw).

<P>Sten Johansson in M<FONT SIZE=-1>ONATO</FONT> noemt het boek een aanrader.
Maar aan wie houdt van lichte lectuur, raadt hij aan de inleiding over te
slaan.

<P>Om in de sfeer te blijven, kunnen we ook nog het verschijnen van de derde
novellenbundel van Leopold Vermeiren aankondigen.  <I>La bela
petveturantino</I> borduurt voort op het kaderverhaal dat in <I>La nuda
feino</I> en <I>La ludanta lumo</I> werd aangezet.  Aan de naef erotische
verhalen zullen velen plezier beleven.<BR> gvd

ANTWERPEN '97</H2>
<H3>KULTURA SEMAJNFINO PRI KOMUNIKADO</H3>
<H4>30a kaj 31a de majo kaj 1a de junio 1997</H4>

Post 4 sukcesaj jaroj, ni prezentas al vi la programon por nova
internacia kultura semajnfino en Antwerpen.

<P>Ni konservos la elementojn el la antaaj aran&#248;oj, kiuj garantiis
kontentigajn rezultojn:
<P>- la renkonti&#248;o estas malgranda kaj intima (inter 50 kaj 70
   partoprenantoj)<BR>
   - la partoprenantaro estas internacia<BR>
   - la Esperanto-domo restas konstante malferma: tie ni renkonti&#248;as,
   trinkas, man&#248;as, ripozas, babilas, kantas, ricevas informojn, vizitas
   libroservon ktp.<BR>
   - ni principe ne prizorgas proprajn programojn, sed &#230;i&#230;eronas vin
   dum promenadoj, dum muzeovizitoj, dum atoekskurso ktp.<BR>
   - ni formas laborgrupon de homoj, kiuj flue parolas Esperanton kaj
   zorge preparis sin por siaj taskoj; dum la tuta aran&#248;o ni volas
   helpi vin pri io ajn, kion vizitanto bezonas<BR>
   - ni gastigas vin ladezire en hotelo a &#230;e Esperantistoj

<P>Nova&#188;o en &#230;i tiu aran&#248;o estas ellaboro de temo: KOMUNIKADO.
   Tio evidente estas temo, kiu t&#253;sas homojn kiuj uzas Esperanton.
   &#216;i ricevas apartan gravecon en la urbo kie eldoni&#248;as Monato kaj
   aro da Esperanto-libroj. Unu el la eroj de la aran&#248;o do estas
   konati&#248;o kun la komunikeblecoj de la Esperanto-centro en Antwerpen.
   Krome ni reliefigos la temon per vizito al la &#172;urnalmuzeo kaj al
   la muzeo Plantin-Moretus (pri presarto) kaj per tuttaga ekskurso en
   la haveno de Antwerpen.

<P>En la programo, ni anta&#253;vidas en &#230;iu tagoparto
   eblon por elekti inter 2 au 3 proponoj. Tiel la grupoj restas
   sufi&#230;e malgrandaj kaj la kontakto kun la &#230;i&#230;erono ne perdi&#248;as.

<P>Tial ni ankorau proponas serion da aliaj ebloj por konati&#248;i kun
   la kulturaj valora&#188;oj de Antwerpen:
<UL>
<LI> vizito al "Antwerpen miniature"
<LI> diversaj promenadoj, i.a. al malpli turismaj anguloj
<LI> vizito al
<UL>
<LI>la katedralo
<LI>la pre&#248;ejo Karolo Boromeo
<LI>la Muzeo pri Belartoj
<LI>Hessenhuis (latemaj artekspozicioj)
<LI>la Folkloromuzeo
<LI>la plant&#248;ardeno
<LI>la diamantmuzeo
</UL></UL>
<P>Eble ne &#230;iuj programeroj efektivi&#248;os. Tio dependas de la elekto de
la personoj, kiuj ali&#248;as. Tial ni petas vin por indiki sur la ali&#248;ilo
kion vi &#254;atus viziti. Vi e&#230; rajtas aldoni sugestojn, &#230;ar ni strebas
liveri programon, kiu kontentigas vian interesi&#248;on.

<P>Pasintjare, ni akceptis la kvantan maksimumon da gastoj.
Tial ni konsilas al vi por
ali&#248;i kiel eble plej balda&#253;, &#230;ar la risko ekzistas, ke
ni devos malakcepti homojn.<P>

Sekve al la multaj petoj de kontentaj uzantoj de la tekstprogramo
apelilo 1.0, Flandra Esperanto-Ligo nun povas prezenti al vi version
2.0 de la fama produkto de <I>Professional Consulting</I>.
<P>apelilo 2.0 estas kompleta profesia tekstprogramo, liverita en
bela ledsimila ujo, kun manlibro.

apelilo 2.0 kompreneble disponas
pri iuj ecoj, kiujn oni prave atendas de tekstprogramo:
<UL>
<LI>dikigo, kursivigo, substreko, trastreko
<LI>rektigo dekstren, maldekstren a amba, kaj centrado
<LI>iuj necesaj litergrandoj
<LI>tabeliloj
<LI>70 diversaj tiparoj, kun la necesaj literoj por tajpi
Esperanton kaj multaj aliaj lingvoj (inkluzive de la Skandinavaj
lingvoj)
<LI>eblo simple instali ankora aliajn litertiparojn
<LI>250000-vorta Esperanto-literumilo!
<LI>Atomata konvertado inter diversaj retsistemoj (cx, c^, ^c, ch ...)
kaj la veraj Esperanto-literoj. Eblo eksporti 7-bite por uzado en
HTML-paoj.
</UL>
Krome versio 2.0 regalas la uzanton per pluraj novaj aferoj:
<OL>
<LI><EM>Novaj tiparoj:</EM>
apelilo nun proponas e pli da tiparoj ol is nun.
Aldone pluraj el la malnovaj tiparoj ricevis kelkajn korektaojn kaj signajn
kompletigojn.
<LI><EM>Dividilo por Esperanto:</EM>
apelilo nun proponas profesian vortdividilon por Esperanto. i klopodas
dividi la radikoj kaj ene de tiuj la silaboj. Eblas
dividi tutan dokumenton, dividi ekde tajpsigno a maldividi ekde tajpsigno.
<LI><EM>Plia metodo supersigni:</EM>
Aldone al la isnuna metodo supersigni per la stirklavo, apelilo nun
permesas la aplikon de la cirkumfleksa klavo. Aldone la klavo W estas nun
komutebla inter W kaj .
<LI><EM>Ciferklavaro:</EM>
Nun estas eble komplete redifini la klavojn de la ciferklavareto per signoj
utilaj por la tekstprilaborado. apelilo venas jam kun difinoj por iuj specoj
de citiloj kaj kelkaj aliaj tipografiaj signoj.
Per tiu rimedo via klavaro nun havas 15 aldonajn klavojn, kiujn vi mem
povas difini.
<LI><EM>Aldonaj signoj:</EM>
En la apelilaj tiparoj la 12 Esperantaj apelitaoj anstataas iujn
Skandinavajn signojn. (Tio estis tenike nepre necesa kaj
vere neevitebla, por ke apelilo funkciu internacie en iuj nacilingvaj
versioj de Vindozo.) Tamen nun ni sukcesis minimume realdoni kelkajn el la
perditaj Skandinavaoj en la 8 ankora liberaj lokoj restantaj en la signaro.
Do la apelilaj tiparoj nun redisponebligas la Skandinavajn literojn (sen la
Islandaj).
Alivorte la amplekso de la signaro nun reegalas al LATIN-1, tamen plus
Esperanto kaj minus la Islanda.
<LI><EM>Bonigita kaj pli ampleksa literumilo:</EM>
La manipulado de la nacilingvaj vortaroj aniis jam tuj post la plej unua
subversio de apelilo. Ekzistas apartaj nometendaoj por distingi
nacilingvan vortaron de Esperanta.
Aldone estas menciinde, ke la amplekso de la vortaro preska duobliis kaj
ke i nun entenas iujn radikkombinojn el PIV.
<LI><EM>Aldonaj tekstformatoj:</EM>
Tiu versio de apelilo nun distingas inter pura x-formato kaj la apelila
xq-formato. Aldone estas nun eble malfermi miksformatan askian
dokumenton - ekzemple mesaon el Interreto. Krom tio estas nun eble lani
apelilon kune kun la dosiernomo de la malfermota dokumento.
<LI><EM>Trilingva dato:</EM>
La nova datfunkcio nun aldone enovas la nomon de la tago. i nun
kapablas tion trilingve, depende de la elektita fenestra lingvo.
<LI><EM>Dekstra musbutono:</EM>
En la unua ikonaro estas nun eble aldone apliki la dekstran butonon de la
muso por atingi kelkajn funkciojn parencajn al la precipaj.
<LI><EM>Pli longa historio:</EM>
La historio de us prilaboritaj dosieroj estas nun 8-era.
<LI><EM>Proverbaro:</EM>
Tre utile al iuj multoskribantoj, ni aldonis la kompletan tekston de la fama
<I><NOBR>"Proverbaro Esperanta"</NOBR></I>. Tiu senkosta aldono devenas de
la komputila reto Interreto.
<LI><EM>ABC:</EM>
Nova estas anka utila vortalfbeto por literumi e telefono.
<LI><EM>Tri ludoj:</EM>
Por distri vin aldoniis kelkaj ludetoj. Vi povas nun ludi rekte kontra la
inteligenteco de apelilo per
<UL>
<LI>Alumeta ludo
<LI>Kahela ludo
<LI>Memora ludo
</UL>
<LI><EM>Helpo pri helpo:</EM>
ar multaj uzantoj fakte ne konas la Vindozan helpsistemon tre bone, la
helpmenuo ricevis aldonan eron kondukantan al la nacilingvaj klarigoj pri la
principa uzo de helpejoj. Aldone estas menciinde, ke la helpejo en pluraj
lokoj estas konsiderinde pli detaligita.
<LI><EM>Manlibro:</EM>
Al apelilo 2.0 nun apartenas kompleta 60paa
manlibro kun iuj detaloj pri la uzado de la programo.
<LI><EM>Vindozo 3.1 kaj Vindozo 95:</EM>
La nova versio de apelilo funkcias ne nur sub Vindozo 3.1 kaj 3.11 sed
anka sub Vindozo 95.
</OL>
<H4>apelilo 2.0 kun iuj siaj avantaoj kaj kun la praktika manlibro
kostas nur 5130 BEF (= . 250 markoj, 168 dolaroj) plus afranko.<P>
Aetintoj de apelilo 1.0 ricevos disketojn per kiuj eblas transiri
al versio 2.0 kontra nur 2050 BEF (= . 100 markoj, 67 dolaroj)
plus afranko.</H4>

<H3>La nuda feino (Leopold Vermeiren)</H3>
Leopold Vermeiren estas esperantisto. Tamen tiun i verkon li aperigis
unue en la Nederlanda lingvo. De li jam aperis pli ol 70 verkoj en la
Nederlanda. Nun li debutas esperantlingve per <I>La nuda feino</I>, ok
erotikaj rakontoj. Espereble li en Esperanto furoros same kiel en la
gepatra lingvo de la verkinto! ``La etoso de la tuta verko: erotika, poezia,
milde ironia, fantaziplena, kazas, ke la legado estas vera
uo.'' (Rejna de Jong en <I>Heroldo de Esperanto</I>).

enhavo estas laalfabeta, temojn oni elektu la propra bezono.
<P>
La unuopaj gramatikaj problemoj praktikeblas plurnivele per
travideblaj, bone aranitaj ekzercoj. Modeloj enkondukas la laboron,
plurloke desegnaoj ilustras kaj vigligas la paojn.
<P>
La praktikilo estas bone uzebla je mezgrada lingvonivelo ne nur por
memlernantoj, sed anka dum la kursa instruado.

<H3>Dole-amare (Emile Van Damme)</H3>

forte efikis al mi pro sia forta interplekto de vizio, simbolo kaj
formo.'' Rejna de Jong skribis: ``i estas unu el miaj plej favorataj
libroj.'' Ilustris la poemaron la atoro mem.

<H2>Teatro tradukita</H2>
<H3>Oktavia (atribuita al Seneko)</H3>
Traduko de Gerrit Berveling. Nerono - imperiestro de Romo, historie
sufie konata pro krueleco kaj
frenezeco - anka en sia familia rondo
kazis
tragediojn. Tion montras tiu i teatrao en kiu repudiita
edzino kontraas konkubinon.
<P>
Seneko, fama atoro de filozofiaj efverkoj, pruvis sian sperton
anka en diversaj dramecaj teatraoj el kiuj Oktavia certe estas la
plej interesa.

u anka vi ios verda paranto?
</H3>
Efektive, ekde nun vi povas investi vian parmonon anka e
Flandra Esperanto-Ligo. Kiel vi procedu?
<P>
Se vi havas iom da parita mono, ekz. 5000 Belgajn frankojn,
300 guldenojn, 250 markojn, 200 Usonajn dolarojn, sendu ilin al
Flandra Esperanto-Ligo (vidu apartan tekston
<A HREF="kielpag.html">Kiel pagi al
Flandra Esperanto-Ligo?</A>) kun la mencio "verda konto". Nenion
plu vi bezonas fari. Vi ne devas iri al banko regule, vi ne devas
trani kuponojn por enkasigi la rentojn, kalkuli la interezojn ...
ion faros por vi FEL, senpage. 4 % da rento atomate adiciios
iujare al la investo tiel ke anka i siavice donas renton.
<P>
Certe anka gravas por vi scii, kion ni faras per via mono. Tio
ne estas sekreto. i estas uzata por subteni projektojn kiuj
antaenigas Esperanton, por eldoni librojn, investi en mainoj,
ktp. Vi ricevas belan renton, kaj samtempe subtenas la
Esperanto-movadon! Duflanka profito!
<P>
iru tuj! Balda vi rie rikoltos...
<H4>
Regularo pri fiksdataj mondeponoj
</H4>
<I>1. Flandra Esperanto-Ligo akceptas fiksdatajn mondeponojn por
   almena du jaroj. Enpagoj, elpagoj kaj transpagoj estas
   notitaj en personaj kontoj e la sidejo de Flandra Esperanto-Ligo.
   Nur la kvitancoj pri tiuj sumoj kaj la kontoj de la Ligo estas
   pruviloj por la deponoj.
<P>
2. La minimuma deponebla sumo estas 5000 Belgaj frankoj (a
 egal-valoro). Se la depono okazis al konto de Flandra Esperanto-Ligo
   pere de banko a poto, ties pruvilo validas kiel kvitanco; se
   la depono okazis en la sidejo de la Ligo, u per transpago,
   u per kontanta mono, la kvitanco validas nur se i estas
   subskribita de la direktoro a estrarano pri financoj de la
   Ligo.
<P>
3. Deponfino okazas nur se Flandra Esperanto-Ligo ricevas anta
   la fino de la dua jaro skribitan averton. Sen averto flanke de la
   deponinto, la depono atomate pludaras du pliajn jarojn.
<P>
4. Elpagoj post deponfino okazos tuj por maksimumo de 20000 Belgaj
   frankoj. Se la petita sumo superas 20000 frankojn, i estas
   repagata en partoj de maksimume po 20000 frankoj iun monaton.
<P>
5. La rento estas fiksita je 4 % kaj restas sen ano is aperas
   publika avizo en la periodaoj de FEL: </I>Horizontaal<I> kaj
   </I>MONATO<I>.
   La rento kalkulias por tuta periodo de unu jaro, ekde la unua
   tago de l' monato sekvanta post tiu de la depono.
<P>
6. La rento estas pagata post iu periodo de unu tuta jaro. Peto
   por elpago de la depono a parto de i anta la deponfino,
   atomate kazas nuligon de la rento de la kuranta jaro, rilate
   al la sumo elpagita. Se aplikias paragrafo 4, estas kalkulata
   rento por iu monato post la fino de la minimuma deponperiodo.
<P>
7. La kalkulita rento estas adiciata al la deponita sumo. La
   paranto povas anka ricevi la jaran renton post simpla peto,
   a transkontigi la renton al sia kuranta konto e FEL.

Privilegiaj klientoj de FEL</H2>
<H3>Flandra Esperanto-Ligo havas pli ol mil
privilegiajn klientojn.</H3>
<H4>Tiuj privilegiaj klientoj</H4>
<OL>
<LI>- ne pagas afrankon kiam ili mendas Esperanto-librojn*,
<LI>- ne pagas afrankon kiam ili mendas Esperanto-diskojn, kasedojn, ktp.*
<LI>- kaj estas regule informitaj pri specialaj malmultekostaj ofertoj.
<LI>- Por ili FEL povas sen administraj kostoj iujare renovigi la
abonojn de diversaj revuoj, la kotizojn de fakasocioj, ktp.
<LI>- Laste, sed ne balaste, ili povas senkoste iri sumojn al UEA-kontoj
kaj al FEL-kontoj kaj akcepti sumojn de aliaj pagantoj.
<LI>- Por privilegia kliento FEL pretas fari transpagojn anka al aliaj
instancoj. En tiu okazo tamen povas ekesti bankkostoj.
</OL>
<H4>Kiel ii privilegia kliento?</H4>
Privilegiaj klientoj estas tiuj, kiuj havas kurantan konton e FEL
en kiu estas 2000 belgaj frankoj a pli.
Por malfermi kurantan konton, simple sendu rondan sumon al unu el la
kontoj de FEL. Kiam vi mendas libron, revuon, a simile, la kostoj
estos simple subtrahitaj de tiu konto. Vi regule ricevos
konteltirojn kaj do scios kiam la mono estos foruzita kaj
kiam estos tempo por denove "plenigi" vian konton.
<H5>* Noto: Ne estas eble kombini rabatojn. Privilegia kliento kiu
mendas rabatitajn librojn, diskojn, ktp.
a kiu ricevas rabaton ar li/i aetas tri samajn objektojn, devas pagi
afrankon.

<OL>
<LI><H4>u estas akireblaj tiparoj por apelilo por la lingvoj rusa,
pola, ukraina kaj ina?</H4>
FEL vendas efektive disketon kun tiparoj por apelilo por la
lingvoj pola, rusa kaj ukraina. ia prezo estas 1000 BEF.
Tiparojn por la ina ni bedarinde ne havas.<P>
<LI><H4>u en apelilo 2.0 vi povas uzi piednotojn?</H4>
Piednotojn en la fino de iu pao ne jam estas ebligitaj en versio 2.0,
sed verajne en versio 3.0. Kompreneble estas eble meti piednotojn je la
fino de iu apitro.<P>
<LI><H4>Kiam aperos versio 3.0 de apelilo?</H4>
Professional Consulting promesis lani version 3.0 tuj kiam 500 ekzempleroj
de versio 2.0 estos venditaj. is nun vendiis 200 ekzempleroj.<P>
<LI><H4>Kiun aparataron kaj programaron oni bezonas por povi instali
apelilon?</H4>
286a procezilo minimume, prefere 486<BR>
4 MB da memoro, prefere 8 MB<BR>
8 MB da libera diskspaco, prefere iom pli<BR>
Windows 3.1, 3.11 a 95<BR>
prefere muso<P>
<LI><H4>Kiom kostas dua ekzemplero de apelilo?</H4>
Licenco por dua (a tria , ktp.) licenco por apelilo, ekzemple
por oficejoj, lernejoj, ktp. kostas 75 % de la normala vendoprezo,
do 187,50 DEM a 3850 BEF + afranko.<P>
<LI><H4>u per apelilo mi povas krei HTML-dosierojn?</H4>
apelilo 2.0 ankora ne atomate kreas HTML-dosierojn.
Vi do mem devos enmeti la ordonojn &lt;H1&gt;,  &lt;/H1&gt;,
ktp. Kiam via teksto estas preta, registru in kiel .lt3-dosieron.
apelilo lasos vin elekti inter la registrado kiel normala 8bita HTML-teksto
a kiel 7bita teksto. La neceso pri 7bitaj HTML-tekstoj iom post iom
malaperas.<P>
<LI><H4>Mi deziras malfermi cx-dosieron kiu nomias "esper", sed dare
apelilo plendas, ke i ne povas malfermi in.</H4>
Renomu in al "esper.cx" kaj la problemo malaperos.<P>

Tri tagoj da uo</H2>
<I>Dekamerono</I> de Giovanni Boccaccio estas eble la plej
konata novelaro de la monda literaturo. i konsistas el cento
da noveloj, enmetitaj en la kadron, la kiu ili estas
rakontataj dum dek tagoj inter dek junaj virinoj kaj viroj,
fuintaj kamparen pro la pesto, kiu paralizis Florencon en la
jaro 1348. Al tiu kadro apartenas, interalie, tre fama
priskribo, kiel la pesto turmentas la urbanojn.
<P>
La plimulto de la noveloj estas erotikaj kaj prezentas
diversajn implikojn, embarasojn, ruzojn, sekvojn kaj entute
cirkonstancojn de amoro inter virino kaj viro. Multaj el la
intrigoj estas komikaj, burleskaj, aliaj estas pli kavaliraj.
Kvankam mezepokaj, la rakontoj ofte impresas liberaj de sia
epoko, eble danke al du aferoj: unue, Boccaccio preska
ekskluzive prezentas la okazaojn realisme, kaj ofte humure.
Magio a supernaturaj fortoj ludas nenian rolon, e foje
estas mokataj, se ni ne parolu pri la supernatura forto de la
amoro! Due, li certagrade defias, tamen lerte evitas tro
konfrontii kun la seksa kaj socia moralo de sia tempo. Tion
li faras diversmaniere: en kelkaj rakontoj, kie prezentias
malpermesita amo, li savas la moralon per simpla truko --- fine
aperas ia antae kaita fakto, kiu anas la perspektivon,
tiel ke la amo farias aprobinda, ekzemple: iu malriulo
montrias esti nobelo, a simile. Alifoje Boccaccio lokas
siajn rompojn de la moralo en suba socia klaso, kie ne necesas
(el vidpunkto desupra) tiel rigore defendi la striktan
moralon, a kelkfoje e en la islama mondo.
<P>
La rakontoj prezentataj en <I>Dekamerono</I> parte estas galerio el
malnovaj fabeloj, legendoj kaj anekdotoj, rakontitaj en
diversaj landoj kaj epokoj preska ekde Adamo, kaj fojfoje
uzitaj de aliaj verkistoj. Boccaccio majstre kunmetis ilin,
donis al ili arman kadron, kiu tiklas la fantazion de la
leganto, sed samtempe vestis tiujn i rakontojn, parte tre maldecajn,
per senkulpa naiveco. Li tajlas iun novelon unuope, tamen
konservante certan unuecon inter ili.
<P>
En tiuj rakontoj, kies agado okazas inter simplaj popolanoj, li
uzas senbalastan, rustikan stilon, kaj tie anka erotikaj
aludoj aperas malpli vualite. La stilo de la noveloj do
varias: en kelkaj la rakonto estas pli simpla kaj senpera, en
aliaj pli ornamita kaj plena de kavalireskaj parafrazoj kaj
perifrazoj.
<P>
La unuaj tri tagoj de <I>Dekamerono</I> nun aperis en esperanta vesto
de Waringhien kaj Martinelli. La lingvaon de Boccaccio la
tradukintoj elektis interpreti per stilo iom aparta. Tiu
karakterizias per frazoj longaj, plenaj de participaj
adverboj.
<P>
Mi trovas la stilon konvena kaj konforma al la rakontmaniero de
Boccaccio. Eble oni povus uzi la rimedon iom malpli malavare,
ar fojfoje la legado de tiuj stakoj el participoj lacigas.
En kelkaj esceptaj lokoj aperas esprimoj tro modernaj, kiuj
disiras la iluzion pri la 14a jarcento. Ekzemple, vortoj
kiel <I>far</I> a <I>apertigi</I>, a frazoj kiel
<I>mi belas kaj inas</I>. Tiuj konvenus en teksto el nia
epoko, sed ne en mezepokaj rakontoj.
<P>
Male al multaj nacilingvaj tradukoj, tiu i ne konsistas el
elektitaj pecoj, sed prezentas fidele la tuton de tiuj tri
tagoj. Mi konsideras tion kiel tre gravan donacon al la
esperanta kulturo, kaj mi ege esperas, ke eblos finfari la
tutan verkon samambicie. Restas tiom da armegaj rakontoj el
la ceteraj sep tagoj, kiujn mi avidas legi (en Esperanto)!
<P>
Mi emfaze rekomendas i tiun libron al iuj legemuloj. Al tiuj,
kiuj preferas leeran, amuzan legadon mi konsilas transsalti
la enkondukojn kaj tuj ploni en la rakontojn. Ne hontu,
uu!

<H2>Tempo fuas</H2>
<H4>de</H4>
<H3>William Auld</H3>
Malgra sia juneco - li certe ne ais pli ol tridek kvin jarojn, kio ajnis
al mi juna - mia najbaro Arturo Preston estis siatempe akirinta
konsiderindan reputacion kiel debuta sciencisto. Kiam li heredis iom da
mono kaj liberiis el sia posteno kaj sin retiris de la publika konateco,
iuj homoj esprimis bedaron pri lia ``neuzota talento''. Tiuj ja ne sciis -
verajne neniu sciis krom mi - ke li dedias sian tempon kaj sian monon al
solvado de antikva enigmo, nome vojaado tra la tempo. Tion sciis mi, nur
pro tio, ke Arturo jam delonge traktis min kiel surogatan patron, personon
fidindan, kun kiu li povis komunikii. Pri la fiziko, kiel anka pri aliaj
sciencoj, mi sciis nenion, sed kompreneble tia scio ne necesis. Arturo
bezonis nur alparolaton, ne nepre askultanton.
<P>
Principe tamen mi opiniis ekscita lian koncepton pri tempovojaado, sed ege
neprobabla. Kiam do li sin prezentis en mia domo iun posttagmezon kaj,
streaspekta sed reganta siajn emociojn, diris, ``Mi sukcesis!'', mi estis
konsternita kaj ne volis kredi lin.
<P>
``Mi vojais en la pasintecon dekfoje dum la usa horo, kaj mi restis en la
elektitaj epokoj dum periodoj ekde dek minutoj is dek tagoj,'' li diris
kviete, tamen kun bridita ekscitio. ``Ne temas pri hazardao, mi certigas.
Tio, kion mi ofte diris al vi pri la naturo de la tempo kaj kiamaniere
jungi in, estas vera, vera, vera!''
<P>
``Se tio vere veras, Arturo -'' mi komencis iom hezite; sed li ekkaptis mian
brakon kaj tire starigis min.
<P>
``Venu vidi mem.''
<P>
Eble influite de la konata romano de Jean Forge, mi atendis, ke lia aparato
estu pli komplika. Sed ne; laaspekte i estis nenio alia ol rektangula
skatolego iom pli granda ol homa staturo, kun pordo por eniri kaj eliri,
staranta en ambro alie senmebla.
<P>
Arturo malfermis la pordon kaj ni enrigardis. La internon prilumis iaspeca
ampolo, kvankam mi ne rimarkis signojn de potencigo. Sur unu muro vidiis
instumentaro en la formo de altilo kaj pluraj numeritaj ciferplatoj.
<P>
``Oni nur indikas la deziratajn tagon, monaton kaj jaron sur la ciferplatoj,
depremas la altilon, kaj sonorilo tintas indikante la alvenon. Oni
malfermas la pordon kaj eliras - en la deksesan jarcenton a kiam ajn oni
elektis.''
<P>
``Vi devas konsenti, Arturo, ke tio ajnas iom neprobabla...''
<P>
``Mi tion faris jam dekfoje, u ne? Dekfoje, al dek diversaj epokoj!''
<P>
``Sed la revenvojo? Kiel vi revenas?''
<P>
``Nu jes, tio en la komenco kazis al mi iom da zorgoj. Mi fine solvis iujn
problemojn, atomatigante la revenon al la preciza minuto de la foriro.
Necesas nur reeniri la mainon, premi la altilon kaj - pum! oni revenas al
la nuntempo. Askultu, mi vidas, ke vi dare iom skeptikas. Kial ne provi
mem?''
<P>
``Ho, pri tio mi ne certas. Mi - mi ankora ne mense prepariis.''
<P>
``Nenia danero. Jen! mi montros al vi. Decidu vi, al kiam mi vojau, kaj mi
iros tiamen. Diru do, kiam?''
<P>
``Ho - nu - 1836.''
<P>
``Bone!''
<P>
Li eniris la mainon kaj fermis la pordon. Mi adis mallatan tinton de
sonorilo, la pordo malfermiis, kaj elvenis Arturo kontente ridetante.
<P>
``Jen do! Al 1836 kaj revene! Por esti certa, mi restis unu-du horojn kaj
iom irkarigardis. Jam via vico. Al kiam vi volas iri?''
<P>
``Arturo, mi vere ne scias...''
<P>
``Kio pri 1314? Batalo de Banokburno! Homo, i okazis nur kelkajn mejlojn de
i tie! Pensu pri tio! La plej glora momento de Skotlando, kaj vi eestos!''
<P>
Li puis min en la skatolegon. Efektive, mi jam vere ekscitiis. Kiam li
fermis la pordon malanta mi, mi hezitis nur kelkajn momentojn anta ol
alustigi la ciferplatojn al 24-06-1314. Poste mi fermis miajn okulojn kaj
depremis la altilon. Tintis sonorilo. Mi malfermis miajn okulojn. Nenio
ajnis aniinta. Mi streis mian kuraon.
<P>
Kaj malfermis la pordon. Jen estis Arturo en ties senmebla ambro,
vastokula kaj entuziasmega. Li alsaltis min kaj kaptis ambamane la
refaldaojn de mia jako. Li estis preska senkohera.
<P>
``u vi vidis lin? u vi vidis Roberton Brus? u li ion diris? u tio ne
estis absolute la plej mirinda sperto de via vivo?''
<P>
Kiel mi jam diris, li estas pli juna ol mi, kaj anka multe pli forta...
<P>
``Jes, jes, mirinda, mirinda!'' mi balbutis.
<P>
Unu el ni estas freneza, kaj ne temas pri mi. Sed supozeble li ne kazas
multan domaon, en- kaj el-irante sian skatolegon dum la tutaj tagoj. Kaj
e se mi devas pasigi multajn vesperojn askultante liajn priskribojn de la
vivo en aliaj epokoj, tio estas malpli enuiga ol televido. Neniu volas sian
filon, e surogatan, enlosigi en frenezulejon, se eblas tion eviti.

<H2><I>Nova lernolibro de la vivo</I></H2>
La atoro de <I>Paco en tormo</I>, M. A. Rohrbach, estas la inspirinto
de la JEAN-movado. JEAN estas litervorto por Juneco mensa, Edukado
de si mem, Ardo en laboro kaj Nobleco konduta. i estas movado
en kiu oni grupe stimulas sin por pli konscie vivi pere de jogo.
Vivi estas evolui. ``io evoluas, mineralo same kiel homo.''
Sed la homo povas konscie evolui: ``seri la veron por progesi,
kaj progresi por pli bone servi''. Ni konsciu, ke ekzistas absoluta
vero, kiu tamen manifestias en la homa socio per niaj limigitaj
eblecoj. ``Intermiksinte tiun nocion pri absoluto kaj ties neeviteblajn
manifestiojn, relativajn kaj multoblajn, la homoj fortege malamis
kaj luktis.'' ``Esplorado al la vero estas anta io rimedo por
progresi.'' Ni spertas felion, iam kiam ni alproksimias
al absoluta vero kaj agadas konforme: ``Nin feliigas, ne la
,posedo' de la vero mem, sed la novaj ebloj agi kazitaj de niaj
kontaktoj kun i.''<P>
Rohrbach substrekas la neceson de agado:
``Evoluo do estas nek rekompenco, nek puno, nek eterna rekomencio;
i estas kreado, kiu plu daras; i estas la vojo de novaj
konstruoj.'' ``Sukcesas'' ne la homoj vivantaj en facila riabundo;
sukcesas la ``filoj de siaj faroj'', kiuj konstruis la propran ekziston
venkinte la sennombrajn obstaklojn renkontitajn. Por ili obstaklo
estis rimedo por progresi al sia celo''. ``iuj eventoj, kiuj
okazas en via ekzisto estas necesaj, ar ili alportas la instruon
a sperton, kiun vi atendas. Tamen vi devas estri la cirkonstancojn
kaj ne sklave submetii al ili.'' Kvankam la lecionoj de Rohrbach
direktias al individuoj, li emfazas la interligitecon: ``...
JEAN-Jogo orientias ne nur ,vertikale' por la nura bono de la
praktikanto, sed anka ,horizontale' al la rilatoj, devoj kaj
servoj, kiuj pravigas la ekziston surteran.'' ``E se homo trovis
pacon por si mem, li ne povas apartii el la suferoj kaj nescio
de siaj samuloj.''
Supozeble, Rohrbach konstatis, ke la laborkampo de la JEAN-movado
povus multe pli vastii per la verkado de libroj. Li verkis
<I>La Paix dans la Temp&#234;te</I> en la franca. i celas konduki individuojn
sen antaa preparo al memstara disvolvado de siaj eblecoj por
sperti felion en la malkovro de absoluta vero. ``Paco en tormo''
estas skipa traduko en Esperanton, sub gvidado de Jean-Claude
Gionco, de la dua reverkita franca eldono.<P>
ajnas, ke la atoro sukcesis en sia strebo por konduki
la leganton por malkovri kio esence gravas en nia vivo kompleksa
kaj ofte malfacile digestebla. Tiel Rohrbach volas prepari nin
al la mutacio en la tera vivo, kiu la li anoncias. Tiu mutacio
ja okos kaj suferigos tiujn kiuj ``rezignas darigi esploron,
kies signo, rimedo kaj rekompenco estas felio''. i des pli
facilos, se granda homgrupo mense preparis sin al tio. La libro
estas verkita en bona Esperanto. La sola makuleto, kiu trafis
min estas ``Creado'' en la enhavtabelo. La stilo estas konciza
kun simplaj frazostrukturoj. La tekstoj ne enhavas fakvortojn.
Sekve ili flue legias. Mi povas varme konsili la libron al
tiuj personoj, kiuj interesias pri tia temo.<BR>

Renkontio kun japanaj fantomoj</H2>

La atoro Lafcadio Hearn ne bezonas prezenton al angle parolantaj
studantoj de la japana kulturo. Per siaj beletraj verkoj, tradukaoj
kaj publicistaj artikoloj li estis la unua, kiu disvastigis
la kulturon kaj literaturon de Japanio en la okcidenta mondo.

Hearn naskiis en 1850 en Grekio, edukiis en Britio kaj Francio,
kaj kiel 19-jarulo elmigris en Usonon. Tie li komencis sian verkistan
karieron e pluraj gazetoj, kontribuante originalan kaj tradukitan
prozon kaj poezion, klerajn eseojn kaj politikajn raportaojn.
Li laboris kiel vojaanta urnalisto inter 1887 kaj 1889 en la
Francaj Antiloj kaj en 1890 en Japanio, kie li definitive eklois.
Li komencis labori kiel lerneja instruisto de la angla lingvo,
kaj en 1891 edziis al japanino, Koizumi Secuko. En 1895 li
fariis japana regato kaj, adoptante la familian nomon de la
edzino, iis konata kiel Koizumi Jakumo. Lia plej brila kaj
fekunda periodo estis en 1896 --- 1903, kiam li estis profesoro
pri angla literaturo e la Imperia Universitato de Tokio. En
1904 li mortis pro kormalsano, lasante sian lastan verkon, kolektaon
da prelegoj celantaj interpreti Japanion en malpli idealigita
maniero ol li faris en siaj pli fruaj verkoj.
<P>
<I>Fantomrakontoj</I> ne estas la sola verko de Lafcadio Hearn
tradukita en Esperanton. La unua verko estis tradukita du fojojn, sub diversaj
titoloj. ``La animo de la granda sonorilego'' estis esperantigita
de Charles Elwoord Randall kaj aperis en <I>Lingvo Internacia</I> (1909,
p. 440). La duan version, titolitan ``La
animo de la sonorilego'' tradukis E.M. Gundy por publikigo en
<I>Literaturo</I> (1921, p. 62). La dua esperantigita verko de Hearn, ``La elekto
de Estero'', erpita el<I> Disaj folioj el stranga literaturo</I>
(1884), estis elangligita de P. J. Cameron kaj aperis en<I> La Brita
Esperantisto</I> (1909, p. 144). Nun esperantistoj povas ui legadon de na
rakontoj el Kwaidan --- historioj kaj studaoj pri strangaj aferoj,
eldonita en Usono en 1904.
<P>
La ekzota fono de la historietoj konsistas el budhismaj religiaj
kredoj, folkloraj superstioj kaj historiaj okazintaoj. La
stilo estas tre simpla, karakteriza de la rakonta prozo. Bedarinde,
ie kaj tie trovias kelkaj malglataoj, ar nur japanlingvuloj
kontrolis kaj reviziis la tekston de la tradukinto. Per pied-
kaj post-notoj estas glositaj vortoj kaj terminoj rilatantaj al
apartaoj de la japana kulturo. Post iu rakonto trovias
bibliografiaj notoj pri la japanlingvaj fontoj, kiujn Lafcadio
Hearn utiligis por siaj rakontoj, imagplene reverkitaj. Apendice
estas unupaa kronologia skizo pri la vivo de la atoro.

<H2>Hejmo en Mezeropo</H2>
Telefonsono reekis kelkfoje anta ol i trafis la ustan tavolon
de mia dormo. Miaj nudaj piedoj kuris al la aparato, kiu pendas
sur la muro. La mano atingis la askultilon anta ol la timo
disveriis tra la korpo. Mi loas en la parto de la mondo,
kie oftas la malbonaj novaoj.<P>
-&#160;i mortis. Anta du horoj.<P>
La voo, kiu informis min, ke la punkto estis metita, apartenis
al mia patro. La voo estas neiutaga, vualita, la morto estas
al li tro proksima.<P>
La morto venas el la norda Kroatio. El Mezeropo. Tie, en la
provinca efurbo estas fama tombejo. La urbo nomis in sia
efa vidindao. Tien pilgrimas ne nur parencoj de mortintoj
kun kandeloj kaj krizantemoj, la simboloj de la tombejo. Aperas
tie anka raraj turistoj, kiam ne gvidas ilin profesiuloj.<P>
e la enirejo unue eniras la vidkampon bronza statuo, nudpieda
kaj malgaja. Somere iam la mano de la statuo, de kiu la tono
ne forprenis mildecon, tenas inter longaj fingroj frean floron.
Virinon prezentas tiu statuo kaj falbaloj de ia robo tre mole
elverias is la plata tomba kovrilo. i estas tre bela.
Sur ia vizao videblas, ke neniu iam kisis in. La tono
ne forprenis mildecon de i.<P>
La unuan de novembro, e la tago de iuj sanktuloj, free rostitaj
katanoj odoras is la aleo de mortintoj. Malvarmo en la uoj,
varma katano inter la fingroj. Avino pagas la katanojn, la
nepoj rigardas la braon. Vendisto kovras rostitajn katanojn
per kuseno, por ke ili ne malvarmiu. Kun katanoj en la mano
eblas direktii al la tombejo. Oni formanos ilin anta ol
trapasi la tombejan barilon.<P>
Inter mi kaj la morto nun estas sepdek kilometroj.<P>
-&#160;Mi venos. Mi ekveturos tuj.<P>
<I>Telefono. En malnova poto i pendis sur la muro kaj la oficisto
kriis en in: Haloo! Oni nenion adas! Halooo!
Estas longa rakonto kiel mi sukcesis akiri tiun malnovan telefontipon
por la hejma uzo. La poto pretis interani modernan aparaton
kontra tiu preska iama. Mi volis in havi hejme kaj uzi
in - esti en kontakto kun la nuna mondo per la ilo de iamo.
La uzanto de la telefono devas en mia hejmo stari dum la parolado
kiel en publikaj telefonejoj. Pro la starado la piedoj balda
ekdoloras; tial la konversacioj estas tre mallongaj kaj esencaj.
Kiu? Kiam? u?
Vizitantoj kutime ne scias uzi la telefonon ar e i, la mezeropa,
la diskado de la ciferoj ne okazas atomate: necesas per sia fingro
reiri al la cifero, kiun oni elektis kaj ekturnis. Necesas helpi
al la aparato. La vortoj elparolitaj enfalas en la truon de la
rompita bakelita askultilo. Preska oni povas vidi kiel la
vortoj forglitas en la truon. Tie, e la alia flanko de la
mesao, la orelo kiel fikapta reto etendias por kapti la
vortojn. Se la mesao estas agrabla, la vokaloj estas doletaj
kaj la orelo bedaras kiam la lasta forsonas.<P>
En Mezeropo oni ne iam sukcesas telefoni. Ofte lineoj estas
troaritaj. Strangaj sonoj fuzumas en la askultilo. Foje
intermiksias iu alia konversacio en kiun facile eblas enmiksii
-&#160;Kion vi diris? - Atendu ke mi diskos la nulon. - La nulo iel
povus igi la lineon pli klara. u pli bone? Iomete. Kie mi
haltis? Nu, iukaze ... Post kelkaj frazoj, denove iu estas
en la lineo. Esti en la lineo signifas kunsenti spiradon de iu
neinvitita. Foje adeblas iuj fremdlingvaj interparoloj. Estas
amuze diveni la lingvon. u la araba? La mesao restas kaita,
tre profunde.<P>
La telefonlineoj en tiu parto de Mezeropo estas iom specialaj:
ne iam eblas uzi ilin. Oni povas posedi plej bonan aparaton,
sed i ne nepre kapablos alsori la voon kun kiu vi atus
paroli: la lineoj tie i estas okupataj, troaritaj, vooj
en ili knaras, a simple la lineoj ``ne estas traireblaj''. Ofte
eksterlandanoj plendas al ni, ke ili klopodis dum pluraj horoj,
kelkajn fojojn, sed ne sukcesis. Ili rakontas pri tio kiel pri
neimagebla situacio kaj la povra alparolato sentas sin iusence
mem kulpa ar li ne estis atingebla. Ni vivas en tiu nia peco
de Eropo kun tiel duone uzeblaj telefonoj niajn tutajn vivojn
kaj lernis paroli mallonge, esence, sen multaj entilaoj kaj
superfluaj vortoj, konsciaj, ke la lineo povus balda ``rompii''
kaj la kunparolanto malaperi definitive post kelkaj enkondukaj
vortoj dum oni e ne sukcesis anonci la kialon de la telefonado.
Se oni volas organizi renkontion a interkonsenti pri vizito,
oni faru tuj dum eblas. Ne diru: Mi telefonos morga. Eble
morga ne funkcios e tio kio funkcietas hodia.</I><P>
La nigrajn vestojn mi jam antae preparis. Nigro estas la koloro
de la morto. iuj proksimaj parencoj vestas sin nigre por la
enterigo. La filinoj de la mortinto devis anta kelkaj jaroj
porti la nigrajn vestojn dum la tuta jaro. Tiel decis. Nun la
regulo iom paliis. Sufias surhavi nigrajn vestojn kelkajn
monatojn nur. Egale u vintre a somere.<P>
Mi vestis la nigrajn trumpojn kaj nigran kostumon. Lastsemajne
mi pruntis nigrajn uojn de mia bofratino. Numero 38. ar
mi sciis, ke tio venos tre balda. Tio estas la morto.<P>
Mi rigardis la nigran sinjorinon en la spegulo. La nigra sinjorino
estas mi. En i tiu rakonto la unua nepino de la forpasinto.
La plej atata nepino, tion necesus aldoni por la usteco de
la rakonto. Eble ne nur tial ar la unua.<P>
Mi eniris la plej proksiman florvendejon. La vendistino de floroj,
vidinte la nigre vestitan eniranton ekstaris, honore al la mortinto
kaj mallatigis la muzikon de la radio. La nigra enirinto sendube
mendos entombigan florbukedon.<P>
-&#160;La bukedo estas por...? <BR>
-&#160;Por mia avino.<BR>
-&#160;Akceptu mian kondolencon.<P>
La vendistino volis scii, por kiu i kreos la floraranon.
i volis koni la rilaton inter la flormendinto kaj la forpasinto.
i proponis al mi lilakkoloran rubandon por la bukedo. Kion
vi atus skribi sur la rubandon?
Mi prenis la etenditan paperon kaj rigardis la pinton de la skribilo.
Necesis rapide elpensi la adiaan saluton. La lastan saluton
al avino de la nepino. in la floristo kopios larlitere sur
la rubandon per kiu estos ornamita la florkrono. Tia estas la
kutimo e ni en nia peco de Mezeropo.
La avino nomiis Tena. Tena estas la mallongigo de Ateno. La
efurbo de Greklando, la helena diino de inteligento, patronino
de Atenanoj. La avino nomiis kiel la efurbo. Kiel la Diino.
La nepino portas la nomon de iu floro. Tie i virinoj floras
kaj fruktas ofte. La nomo restas mesao pri iu memoro, tre nebula.<P>
Cidonio. Grioto. Frago.
Jasmeno. Rozo. Roso. Baziliko.
Slavaj nomoj aritaj per la pezo de la signifo. Odoras ili
kaj havas koloron.<P>
Kiam mi la unuajn minutojn en internacia klaso skribas mian nomon
sur la tabulon kaj returnas la vizaon al la kursanoj, tiu, kiu
ridetas en la klaso rilatas al Mezeropo. Tiu komprenis ke mia
nomo al memoro kaj neforgesado rilatis. Tiu, kiu surhavas tonan
vizaon kaj klopodas deifri la konsonantojn vicigitajn tiu
evidente ne rilatas al slavoj. Por tiu ofte anka Mezeropo
estas losita per sep sigeloj. u li entute emus mallosi
in? Almena provi e la unua sigelo?<P>
La nigraj orelringoj tiklas mian kolon dum la sinjorino vestita
nigre subskribas mian nomon sur la ekon por la florbukedo.<P>
-&#160;u necesas ke nia florejo rekte sendu la bukedon al la tombejo?
Kiam?<BR>
-&#160;Ne necesas, dankon. Mi mem venos morga matene preni in.
Mi decidis veturi kun mia bukedo. Pasigi kun i kelkajn horojn
dum la veturo. Mia onklino Bosa veturigos min. i estas la
tria filino de la avino. La plej juna, la plej atentema, nun
en nigra robo, iom fremda.<P>
-&#160;Kion ni faros pri Beograd? u ni informu? u nenion?
Beograd estas la urbo en kiu loas la dua filino de Tena. En
la tempo de la morto, Beograd estas la efurbo de Serbio kaj
la efurbo de Jugoslavio. Serbio kaj Kroatio militas. Ne estas
la tempo de la mezepoko, estas la fino de la dudeka jarcento.
De Kroatio ne eblas veturi is Serbio. Estis detruitaj fervojaj
linioj, estas forbombarditaj atovojoj, fortranitaj telefonaj
lineoj. La milito konstruis inter Kroatio kaj Serbio la inan
muron de la malamo. Okazis per longaj kaj zigzagaj kialoj, ke
la parto de la familio eklois en Beograd kaj iun matenon komence
de la milito ni devis konstati, ke ni ja havas parencojn en la
efurbo de la malamikoj. Iusence, ke la malamikoj estas parencoj.
Sonis iom timige plukonstrui la opinion, ke ni mem estas la malamikoj.<P>
-&#160;Mi ne plu vidas iun sencon. Mi plej volonte mortus. - diris
Tena iun posttagmezon lace.<BR>
-&#160;Vi ne rajtas morti nun, dum estas la milito, avinjo. Vi devas
atendi la pacon ... Paciencu! u vi volas, ke ni malfermu fenestron?
u vi prenu novan vitaminan trinkaon? Vi devus tri foje tage.<BR>
-&#160;Kiel la vitamino scias, ke estas vespere?<P>
Mi amike frapetas ian etan manon. i ridetas milde kaj nenion
diras hodia pri la malproksimo de la paco.

<H3>ROKMUZIKO</H3>
<H2><I>Germana rokgrupo muzikas brazile</I></H2>
``Menino'' signifas en la portugala ``knabo''. En Germanio
tio estas la nomo de muzikgrupo, kiu ``spicas'' eropan pop-muzikon
per tipa brazila spirito. En la multfacetaj ritmoj kaj harmonioj
trovias stilelementoj el diversaj popolaj muzikspecoj el la
tuta Brazilo: la sambo, ``Afro'' el Bahio a ``Forro'' el Sertao.
E pruntaoj el la eropaj folkloro kaj rokmuziko ne mankas.
La muziko ajnas sukcesplena miksao el la plej bonaj elementoj
eropaj kaj brazilaj.<P>
``Menino'' anka kantas plurlingve: portugale, germane kaj - ajne
nepre necese por rokmuzikistoj - anka angle. Enhave la plej
granda parto de la tekstoj pritraktas brazilajn temojn. Kantas
forta, souleca voo, akompanata de ege viglaj muzikiloj: piano
kaj aliaj klavo-instrumentoj, tamburo, basgitaro, perkutaj
instrumentoj kaj gitaroj. ``Sonas kvaza Peter Gabriel [Pitar
Gejbri el], Sting kaj Paul Simon [Sajmn] kantus kune'', emfazas
Klaus Bleicher [Blajer] de la sud-okcident-germana radio
``SWF3''. La unua laserdisko de la grupo us aperis sub la dulingva
titolo: ``Ein ganz neuer Tag/Uma nova manh&#225;'' (Tute nova tago/mateno). i
jam havas iugradan sukceson en sud-okcidenta Germanio kaj precipe
en la hejmurbo de la grupo. En Ahrweiler preska iu konas la
melodiojn brazilajn.<P>
Sed pli gravas, ke la grupo ne nur pervorte engaias por la
brazilaj ``Meninos e Meninas de Rua'' (= la stratinfanoj: infanoj
plejparte orfaj, kiuj vivas surstrate en iu sud-amerika urbo).
Ekde sia fondio en 1993 ``Menino'' forte subtenas helpprojekton
brazilan en la urbo Maceio/tato Alagoas. Tie pripensemaj homoj
kuniis por doni al la povruloj iom da fizika kaj mensa protekto
kaj perspektivon por la estonteco. ``Menino'' celas kontribui per
mono al tiu projekto, sed ne malpli gravas ia informlaboro. Per
la engaigaj tekstoj, kiuj rakontas pri la suferoj de la
stratinfanoj, ne nur brazilaj, la muzikgrupo varbas por kompreno.
Ili volas alproksimigi anka eropanojn al la ria, sed en Meza
Eropo preska ne konata brazila kulturo.<P>

<H3>MUZIKO</H3>
<H2><I>Beograda az-festivalo</I></H2>
La festivalo kiu komenciis en 1991 per altkvalita programo ajnis
esti la plej granda kaj la plej bona tiuspeca festivalo en tiama
Jugoslavio: ``Somera az', Blus'... kaj Tutmonda Muzika Festivalo''
en Beogrado. Sed tuj e la komenco i devis provizore esi.
En 1995 la arano estis restarigita, kaj en 1996 ``aperis'' la
tria. i-jare la festivalon inaguris az-koncerto de Betty
Carter, la kantistino kiu ofte ricevas ``Grammy''-premiojn, kaj kiu
estas vera anstataintino de Ella Fitzgerald [Ela Ficerald] kaj
Sarah Vaughan [Sara Von]. Estas interese mencii, ke sinjorino
Carter en 1994 gastis en la domo (blanka) de la konata
az-saksofonisto Bill Clinton. En Jugoslavio in la publiko
memoras en duopo kun Ray Charles [Rej alz]<I> Baby It's Cold
Outside.<P></I>
La sekvan vesperon muzikis la juna nederlanda saksofonistino
Candy [Kendi] Dulfer. Anta kvin jaroj, dum la unua festivalo, Candy
lastmomente rezignis pri koncertado timigite de la milito
us komencita en Slovenio. i-jare per la tre arma ``Dolao''
Candy montris al la beograda publiko ion kion i ellernis kaj
eksciis pri muziko. irka tri mil vizitantoj en la ``Centro Sava''
(kie okazas la festivalo) dum duhora koncerto bone amuziis kaj
kontente dancis.<P>
La  trian  vesperon, la  beograda publiko uis (a eble ne?)
koncertadon de Lucky Peterson [Laki Pitersn]. ``La juna princo de
bluso'' estis tro agresema dum siaj gitaristaj piroteknikaoj. Sed
la bona etoso revenis en la halon kiam la sekvan vesperon aperis la
slovena grupo ``Miladojka Junid'', kiu lastfoje gastis en Beogrado
anta pli ol kvin jaroj. Kvankam la repertuaro estis jam konata
al malmultnombraj atantoj de la slovena grupo, tamen la koncerto
estis bona maniero ekkonigi la grupon al junaj beogradanoj kiuj
intertempe proksimiis al la az-muziko. uste tiuj, tuj post la
komenco  de la koncerto, ariis irka la scenejo atente
askultante la kantiston Miroslav Lovri. En la dua parto de sia
programo, la Somera az-Festivalo proponis al la publiko iom pli
bonan muzikon. Al tio kontribuis anka du membroj de la grupo
``Leb i sol'' el Skopje, Makedonio: Koki Dimuevski (klavaraj
instrumentoj) kaj Bodan Arsovski (bas-gitaro). Ili  prezentis  al
Beogrado  siajn novajn projektojn, kaj ilia koncerto certe meritis
pli bonan reklamon kaj pli ol 500 spektantojn.<P>
La vespero kun Jazz Crusaders [az Krusejders] estis ne nur
kleriga sed anka kuraiga ar ili post longa tempo revenis al
siaj radikoj. La uadon kaj virtuozan muzikadon darigis Leri
Koriel kaj la perkutisto el Hindio Trilok Gurtu, kiujn la beograda
publiko memoras pro koncertoj kun John McLaughlin [on Meklafin].
La triopon i-foje kompletigis Andy Sommers [Endi Samers], iama
gitaristo de la grupo Police.<P>
Koncertis anka blus-interpretistoj de la fama muzik-eldonejo
``Aligatoroj'', la gitaristoj Kenny Neil [Keni Nil] kaj Lonny
Brooks [Loni Bruks] kaj la kantistino Coco Taylor [Koko Tejlor].<P>
La fina vespero apartenis al la avangarda kvaropo Kronos, kiu
formale - la instrumentoj - estas ara kvaropo, sed prezentas la
plej eble vastan repertuaron. Oftaj gastoj e elitaj artaj
eventoj kaj anka e la plej grandaj az-festivaloj, ili
brile muzikis anta pli ol 1000 vizitantoj en ``Centro Sava''.
Malgra oficialaj anoncoj, e ne unu loka interpretisto aperis,
kio malbone parolas pri rilatoj kun la landa az-muziko. Sed
restas espero, ke venontjare estos pli bone kaj pli sukcese.<P>

<H4>Jugoslavoj defias la embargon anka kultur-rilate</H4>
<CENTER>
<H2><I>Guma animo (rubber soul)</I></H2>
</CENTER>
Multaj ekpensus, ke temas pri veraj surbendigoj de The Beatles.
Sed ne. Temas pri unika eksperimento de beogradaj atantoj de la
famaj britaj ``longhararuloj''. Dum la lastaj embargo-jaroj en
Jugoslavio oni komencis produkti preska ion kio antae estis
importata. Kaj tiel oni malkovris multajn talentulojn. Unu el
ili, Rastko Ciri, alte taksata grafikisto, atoro de multaj
desegno-filmoj, profesoro e la Arta Universitato, trovias inter
la plej grandaj beogradaj atantoj de The Beatles, la fama brita
kvaropo. Kaj li decidis: se The Beatles ne plu ekzistas, ni mem
produktos ilin. Tio okazis en la jaro 1993.<P>
Ciri iomete serfosis en sia dokumentaro pri The Beatles kaj
elektis 15 el iliaj kantoj, neniam aperigitajn. Pri la kantoj li
sciis nur bazajn informojn: titolojn kaj, por kelkaj kantoj
(kiel<I> Rubber Soul</I>), la jarojn kiam la kantoj estis verkitaj.<P>
Konsciante, ke la kantoj estu stile akordigitaj kun la LP-oj sur
kiuj ili devintus aperi, Rastko Ciri komponis kantojn, kaj
Goran Skrobonja, verkisto de SF-rakontoj, verkis tekstojn en la
angla lingvo. Finfine, ``Rubber Soul Project'' estis preta por
surbendigado. Ciri alvokis siajn samideanojn, muzikistojn kaj
atantojn de The Beatles, kaj dum la vintro de 1995 ili
surbendigis iujn kantojn. Rastko Ciri kantis preska iujn
kantojn, bone imitante la voojn de Lennon kaj McCartney, kaj
samtempe ludis pianon; Miroslav Cvetkovi ludis ``Hefner Violin'',
la saman bas-gitaron kiun uzis McCartney; kaj multaj aliaj
muzikistoj helpis ludante plej diversajn instrumentojn. La
surbendigadon financis la firmao AD & Sons el Londono.<P>
Estas interese, ke multaj vere pensis, ke temas pri kantoj de The Beatles,
ar Rastko Ciri sukcesis atingi perfektecon kaj samtempe
malkovris sian riegan talenton (u en la simpla rokenrol-kanto
<I>Four nights in Moscow</I>, u en la mistera <I>Indian Rope
Trick</I>, kiu
estis farita la la tradicio de la orienteca etapo de The Beatles
kaj enhavas la sonojn de sistro, u en la grandioza <I>Rubber
Soul</I>, kanto kies titolon iuj konas kaj kiun neniu adis).
Krome,
sur la LP trovias anka gajaj kantoj kiel<I> When I Come to
Town</I>.
Tiajn kantojn kutime kantis Ringo Starr, kaj i-foje la kantistan
rolon transprenis Ceda Macura, anka tamburisto, kiu sukcesis
trafi kaj la stilon kaj la manieron de la kantado de Ringo Starr.<P>
Tiu i projekto mirigas per sia trafa etoso kaj alportas
multajn belegajn kantojn, majstre luditajn kaj ornamitajn per
plurvoa kantado. Bedarinde, la LP ne aperis tiam, kiam i estis
surbendigita (duonon da jaro anta ol The Beatles rekuniis kaj
komencis reaperigadi siajn malnovajn kantojn).<P>
<H4>Rubber Soul (Ciri-Skrobonja)</H4>
Remember the times<BR>
 When you were so small<BR>
 Your feelings kept bouncing like<BR>
 The ball on the wall<BR>
 You didn't know nothing<BR>
 Now you know it all<BR>
 But all you are left is this<BR>
 Rubber Soul
<P>
You dig Mother Mary<BR>
 You dig Father Paul<BR>
 Sometimes you think that you
<P>
Can dig rock & roll<BR>
 But listen, my friend<BR>
 Don't whine, cry and call<BR>
 You'll never own<BR>
 Nothing but this<BR>
 Rubber soul
<P>
Standing on the highest top<BR>
 You have to choose flight or fall<BR>
 If you never wanna stop

<H2><I>Arto ligas iujn homojn<BR>
... a eventuale favoras iujn ...
</I></H2>
Arto ligas homojn. Almena tion oni enerale atribuas al i.
Kaj estus bonveniginde, se i kapablus interligi e tatojn,
kiel us pretendis fari ekspozicio en la sud-germana
Rejnlando-Palatinato, kie oni prezentis bildojn kaj objektojn de
artistoj el Israelo kaj Germanio. Ja bonvena arano, konsidere la
konatan historion. Do, sufie da publika atento, almena
gazetare, radie kaj televide. Sed ni iom pli profunde rigardu:<P>
Grupeto da germanaj pentristoj - ekzakte tri - fondis lastajare
la puftitolan ``Asocion por la prosperigado de la internacia
interkomprenado''. Fakte la tuta afero odoras je ``persona
prosperigado'' de la koncernaj artistoj. Jam la asocia kromtitolo
``LINK'' (angle: ligo) indikas fajne, pri kia internacieco temas.
Anka la pompe bunta, sed tamen iom sengusta invitilo, elpensita
de komerca ``Agentejo pri varbado kaj publika komunikado'',
montras en la sama direkto:<I> Vision of a new morning
</I>(anglalingva frazo,
kiu signifas ``Vizio pri nova estonteco''). Invitilo por germanoj
...<P>
Per gazetaj artikoloj la grupo provis varbi pliajn membrojn. Sed
jam ne temis pri artistoj (subite ili estis dek du kun dek du
israelaj artistaj partneroj), sed pri pagantaj subvenciantoj. Tre
malmultaj privatuloj aliis. Des pli sukcese la LINK-anoj
utiligis siajn kontaktojn e oficialaj instancoj: Kiu oficialulo
nuntempe kuraus ne subteni la noblan celon renkontigi germanojn
kaj israelanojn, ne atus sin mem honorigi per (aliulodevena)
mondonaco? Lerte la artistoj elpensintoj komencis sian ``LINK-an''
agadon sur tiu i kampo. Sperte ili anka antavidis, ke tia liga
afero havigos al ili ekspozicion anka en la lando de la
partneroj. Fine, nobla, kiel la ideo, estis la listo de mecenatoj
kaj subvenciantoj tataj, firmaaj kaj organizaaj.<P>
La ekspoziciemuloj sukcesis e enigi sian projekton en la
programon ``Kultura somero de Rejnlando-Palatinato'' kaj - plej
impone - havigi al si la kastelon de Hambach por la ekspozicio en
Germanio. La kastelo estis en la jaro 1848 loko de demokratiaj
eventoj kaj nuntempe servas kiel memorejo pri demokratiaj radikoj
germanaj kaj vizitendejo por la plej renomaj tataj gastoj.<P>
Jen io bone travidebla artifikado, tamen frandao por
recenzistoj pli lertaj en historio kaj sociologio ol en arto.<P>
La ``kompreniga celo'' certe plenumios dum la restadoj de la
artistoj en la reciprokaj landoj. u oni rajtas supozi, ke ili
jam tre bone renkontiis planante tiun i oficialan subvenciotan
renkontion? Sed u vere pli vasta interkomprenio okazis? Inter
la popoloj? Tre dubinde. Kaj kion pri la arto? La kastelaj
respondeculoj permesis, senhistoriige kaj nenecese, kovri tute la
ekspoziciejajn murojn, e la fenestrojn, per lina tofo. La
ekspoziciaojn oni intence aranis sen ordo kaj senkomente
(katalogo ja havebla kontra 40 markoj). Sendube, inter 24
ekspoziciantoj trovias kelkaj kapablaj artistoj. Sed enerale -
se oni ne konsideras nur la volon, la ideon - la kvalito arta,
fakeca estis modesta.<P>
Rilate la estetikon multaj vizitantoj ne nur tre dubis, sed forte
kontrais la ``internan ideon'' pri ``Vizio pri nova estonteco'': La
ekspozicio fakte ne prezentis ideojn, proponojn, viziojn pri
vivinda estonteco, kiel pretekstas la tuta entrepreno, sed
spegulas la mizeran bildon de ambigua, orgojla, banala, multaloke
senkultura ktp nuntempo. Sed ie multekostaj afiegoj invitis al
``Visions of a new morning'' ...<P>
Marena anekdoto:<P>
Per la lina kovrao de la salonaj muroj la ekspoziciantoj anka
kovris savelirejon. Dum la solena inaguro la
``alta protektanto'' ordonis tie malfermi la tofan barilon. La
kastelestro - kontra la volo de la artistoj - tion kun plezuro
tondile prizorgis. Tondao postrestis, tre artisma, pli bela ol
kelkaj ekspoziciaoj. ``Kaj la vualo de la templo disiriis'',
povus esti la la biblio la simbola titolo de tiu i angulo. Sed
la artistoj ofendite reagis. Simpla kastelestro faris la
tranaon - tio ja ne povas esti arto ...<P>

<B>Envido en krean proceson profitigas kaj la kreanton kaj la

Kiu atanto de pentra, desegna a skulpta arto ne
atus kae observi sian preferatan artiston intense lukti kun la
estianta objekto? Normale la artoproduktantoj ja kaasla krean
proceson anta la okuloj de la publiko. Sed en la germana
federacia lando Rejnlando-Palatinato dum la du mezaj semajnfinoj
de septembro la interesitoj havis la eblon viziti artistojn en
iliaj atelieroj senene, senprobleme.<P>
La videmuloj enerale anka tiam ne ofte sukcesis enrigardi en la
estion de artao, ar anka artistoj ajne sabate/dimane ne
laboras, almena ne tiam, kiam ili atendas gastojn. Sed eblis
trafoliumi, preterpai, pridiskuti verketojn same kiel verkegojn,
mire penetri en verkoseriojn parte dum jardekoj evoluintajn,
prisnufi la farboingrediencojn a esplori la diversajn ilarojn
por fakeca elfarado de arta verko. Do bonvena okazo de
interkonatio inter kreantoj kaj interesiantoj.<P>
<H4>Alporti klientojn</H4>
Sendube tiuj konatigaj tagoj en la atelieroj de la landaj
artistoj havis precipe la celon alkonduki al la produktantoj
aetemajn homojn, sed multaj gastigintoj jam dankis la intereson
pri sia verkado kaj memorige proponis la gastolibron al
subskribado. Malfermis siajn pordojn la artistoj, malfermis siajn
okulojn la vizitantoj. Prezentiis profesoroj en pompaj
atelieregoj same kiel komencantoj en la patrina kuirejo, aperis
eblaj klientoj akirintaj bildojn pli-ol-dek-mil-german-markajn
kaj artemuloj sen groo en la poo, okazis urbegaj
spektakloj kaj intimaj babiladoj. Entute profito por amba
flankoj de la arta produktado/interesio.<P>
Artistoj ofte estas problemaj individuoj, kaj klientoj ofte ne
konas la rektan aliron. Pro tio la Asocio de la Belartaj
Verkantoj helpe de tataj instancoj organizis tiujn renkontigajn
tagojn. Firmaoj kaj taggazetoj subvenciis informadon kaj aliajn
kostojn. Profitis proksimume 400 artistoj kaj proksimume 30 000
gastoj de la ege sukcesa kampanjo ``Atelieroj malfermitaj''. Jen
imitinda modelo por aliaj regionoj, artistoj kaj registaroj.<P>

<H3>HISTORIO</H3>
<H2><I>La biblioteko en Vilnius:
<P>
tumulta historio
</I></H2>
En 1995 la biblioteko de la universitato de Vilnius omais sian
425an datrevenon. La radikoj de ia fondio atingas la jaron
1570, kiam jezuitoj invititaj al la lando fondis kolegion. Oni
tiam ne imagis kolegion sen biblioteko. Tiama jezuita
atoritatulo diris: ``Pli bone estas kolegio sen propra preejo ol
sen propra biblioteko''. Tiun ideon apogis multaj tiamaj
tatestroj, pasiaj libroamantoj. Inter ili estis la grandduko de
Litovio kaj reo de Pollando Sigismundus Augustus. Lia donaco al
la biblioteko, 5000 volumoj, donis seriozan fundamenton al ia enhavo. is
hodia en la biblioteko konserviis nur 14 libroj de tiu rea
kolekto.<P>
En la 17a jarcento, la biblioteko riiis preska ekskluzive
danke al donacoj. En la jaro 1665, dum la milito inter Rusio
kaj Svedio, la biblioteko estis evakuita al K&#246;nigsberg (nuna
Kaliningrad) kaj multaj libroj poste ne revenis al Vilnius - ili
malaperis a estis fortelitaj. Gravan damaon la biblioteko
suferis dum la urbaj incendioj de 1610, 1737 kaj 1748.<P>
Post la nuligo de la jezuita ordeno en la jaro 1773, la
universitato fariis eflernejo de la litova granda duklando.
Ekde 1780 la biblioteko komencis ricevadi devigan ekzempleron
de iuj enlandaj eldonejoj (nuntempe tio ne plu okazas, kaj la
biblioteko ne havas monon por akiri tiajn ekzemplerojn ...).<P>
En 1803 la litova eflernejo estis transformita al Imperiestra
Universitato de Vilnius. La biblioteko malfermiis al la publiko.
Balda oni kalkulis 60&#160;000 volumojn en la bibliotekaj stokoj.
Komence de la 19a jarcento la biblioteko estis inter la plej
riaj kaj plej zorge ordigataj en Rusio.<P>
Post la kontraservuta ribelo de 1832, la Universitato de Vilnius
estis fermita. La librostokoj iris al Kievo, Sankt-Peterburgo, arkovo,
Belorusio. En Vilnius malmulto restis de la eksa grandega
biblioteko. En la jaro 1855 en la ejoj de la fermita Universitato
estis fondita muzeo de antikvaoj kaj post kelkaj jaroj apud i
malfermiis legejo. Post kelkaj jaroj ili estis kunigitaj kaj
transformitaj al publika biblioteko de la urbo. i rericevis tuj
post la ribelo konfiskitajn librojn. Ekde la jaro 1904 la
biblioteko ricevadis devigan ekzempleron de iu libro, eldonita en la nord-okcidenta regiono de Rusio. Tiam la libraro
de la biblioteko atingis 200&#160;000 volumojn. Tamen en la jaro 1915
i estis evakuita al Ruslando kaj la libroj estis disetitaj.<P>
En la jaro 1919 la biblioteko estis transformita al la efa librejo
de Litovio. Tuj post la okupacio de la regiono de Vilnius fare de
la poloj la librejo fariis publika biblioteko de S. Bator kaj
tiam i havis 450&#160;000 volumojn. Post la reakiro de la okupita
regiono, la universitata biblioteko denove fariis la efa
biblioteko de la lando. Tamen la alvenintaj germanoj en 1943
fermis in kune kun la universitato. Dum la dua mondmilito
perdiis irka 16&#160;000 libroj, multaj manuskriptoj de 15a is 17a
jarcentoj, kaj valoraj kolektoj de ekslibrisoj.<P>
La biblioteko renaskiis en 1944. Multaj valoraj eldonaoj de 16a
is 18a jarcentoj estis redonitaj el Moskvo (106), Leningrado
(4572), arkovo (1000), Kievo (7542).<P>
Hodia en la fako de raraj eldonaoj estas gardataj 180&#160;000
ekzempleroj, el kiuj 313 estas inkunabloj - libroj de la 15a
jarcento (i tie estas anka la plej antikva inkunablo en Litovio
``Opus de universo'' de R. Maruus). Tiu i kolekto estas la plej
ria aro de plej antikvaj litovaj skribmonumentoj. La biblioteko
havas anka 210&#160;000 manuskriptojn (ekde la 13a jarcento) kaj 8000
grafikaojn el la 18a kaj 19a jarcentoj. Entute en la deponejoj
de la biblioteko estas 5,1 milionoj da eldonaoj. Kiel
centro de la malnovaj libroj, la biblioteko de la
universitato de Vilnius estas la plej granda en Litovio kaj unu
el la plej grandaj en centra kaj orienta Eropo. La biblioteko
is nun sola en la baltaj landoj estas deponejo de Unuiintaj
Nacioj, tio signifas, ke i devige ricevas ekzempleron de iuj
UN-eldonaoj. Ekde la jaro 1964 i estas anka deponejo de Unesko
kaj ekde 1967 de la Monda Organizao pri Sano.<P>

<H3>LITOVIO</H3>
<H2><I>Malalloga por investantoj?</I></H2>
Ne malofte eksterlandaj turistoj kaj komercistoj diras, ke la
litova efurbo Vilnius estas tre malvigla kompare kun la aliaj
baltaj efurboj Riga kaj Tallinn. Ekde la sendependio en 1990
eksterlandanoj investis malpli en Litovio ol en la najbaraj
landoj. is la fino de 1994 por po unu loanto en Litovio estis
investitaj 83 usonaj dolaroj (USD), en Latvio 145, kaj en Estonio
e 314.<P>
Multaj litovoj opinias, ke estonoj simple sukcesis, ar ili vivas
apud ria Finnlando, dum la litova najbaro estas postkomunisma
Pollando. Tamen ne tio estas plej grava. La litova registaro
penas krei allogan bildon de la lando, sed la parlamento akceptas
leojn, kiuj kazas abundajn burokrataojn, tiel ke la peno
farias vana. Kompreneble, multaj problemoj estas komunaj al iuj
eksaj sovetiaj landoj. Tamen en Litovio, malgranda lando kun nur
3,7 milionoj da loantoj, malpli indas investadrisko ol en
Ruslando, kun grandega ebla profito.<P>
is nun la plej granda investo en Litovio estas tiu de Philip
Morris en tabakan fabrikon en Klaipeda: 30 milionoj da usonaj
dolaroj. La litovaj burokrataoj povas nuligi la investdeziron de
iu ajn pretulo. Juna nov-zelanda komercisto Paul Gilbeard posedas
popularan restoracion ``e Parlamento'' en Vilnius. Li diris, ke la
leoj, kiuj reguligas la funkciadon de restoracioj memorigas
romanojn de Franz Kafka. Sur la menuo necesas indiki la pezon de
iu plado. Li memoris pri anta nelonge venintaj inspektoroj,
kiuj kunprenis haringon kun cepoj por certii, u la indikita
pezo respondis al la reala. Respondeculo de Kraft Jacobs Suchard,
kiu en Kaunas posedas sukeraan fabrikon, aldonis, ke al la
malfelioj de la investantoj aldonias malstabileco de la lea
sistemo. Se la leoj dare anias, la investplanoj perdas sian
sencon.<P>
Miloj da riprooj estas direktitaj al la doganejo sur la
pola-litova tatlimo en Lazdijai. Tie ne malofte veturantoj devas
pasigi pli ol 10 horojn. Anta nelonge estis malfermita nova,
moderna limtrapasejo en Kalvarija. Oni esperas, ke i plibonigos
la situacion.<P>
Peter Cornelius, reprezentanto de la Internacia Mona Fonduso,
asertas, ke Litovio fartas malpli bone ol Estonio, kiu estas
komparebla kun Singapuro. La najbareco al Finnlando, striktaj
financaj leoj kaj politiko libera por okcidenta kapitalo donis
al Estonio antaecon eble daran. Tamen anka flirtas la opinio,
ke en Litovio io plibonios, kiam finios la kuponoj, kaj venos
al la lando vera mono. Oni citas la ekzemplon de Pollando, kiu
por siaj reformoj bezonis dekon da jaroj.<P>
Se la registaro darigas la reforman politikon, oni multe atendas
de investantoj en la landan infrastrukturon. Eksterlandanojn
allogas projektoj pri rekonstruo de la marhaveno en Klaipeda,
plibonigo de la atovojoj kaj fervojoj, zorgo pri la sekureco de
la plej potenca nukleo-energia centralo en la mondo en Inganlina.
Okcidenta diplomato rimarkigis: ``Estonio estas invadita de
finnoj, Latvio estas detruita de rusa mono, kaj Litovio restas
netuita.'' Tial i povas farii ``ora ovo'' por eksterlandaj
investantoj.<P>

<H2><I>Malnovaj aviadiloj for</I></H2>
Tuj post la restarigo de la sendependeco anta kvin jaroj,
Litovio ekkreis memstaran aviadilan kompanion<I> Lithuanian
Airlines</I>. Al tio estis ligita la akiro de pli modernaj
aviadiloj. Unu Boeing 737 estis luita de irlanda kompanio GPA,
kaj en 1995, danke al kredito de usona EXIM-banko, estis
aetitaj du samtipaj, jam uzitaj, aviadiloj.<P>
Sed kion<I> Lithuanian Airlines</I> faru pri la malnovaj rusaj TU kaj
JAK, kiuj pli kaj pli malvolonte estas akceptataj en modernaj
eropaj flughavenoj? La registaro permesis vendi ilin. En
1993 kaj 1994 la kompanio jam povis vendi 42 aviadilojn, kaj en
1995 ankora 16. Nun preska iuj malnovaj estas for.
Restas ankora unu TU kaj kvar JAK, sed anka ili jam havas
eventualajn aetantojn. Por malnova aviadilo la kompanio
esperas ricevi po 500&#160;000 usonajn dolarojn. La mono estos
investata en usonajn Boeing.<P>
Nuntempe<I> Lithuanian Airlines</I> flugadas al Parizo, Londono,
Amsterdamo, Frankfurto, Berlino, Kopenhago, Stokholmo,
Varsovio, Istanbulo, Larnako, Moskvo kaj Dubajo.<P>

<H2><I>La giganto ne vekios</I></H2>
<I>La brazila popolo estas de jardekoj sub la influo de tri
popoldiroj, kiuj konstante nutras ties naciismon, sed bremsas
la ekonomian evoluon. La unua diro (el la nacia himno) Brazilo
estas ``eterne dormanta giganto en splenda lulilo''. Kial
vekii? Dua diro remaas konsole, ke Brazilo estas lando de
estonteco. Tiu estonteco neniam aperos. Tria diras, ke en
Brazilo, se oni plantas, la tero donas fruktojn, se oni ne
plantas, la kolektivo donas la fruktojn.<P>
Mandaton post mandato la prezidantoj promesas ``socialan juston'',
sed neniu is nun eksplikis la signifon de tiuj vortoj. La
nuna prezidanto Fernando Henrique Cardoso kvaza per dekreto
informas, ke la inflacio kiu estis 45 % nun restas malpli
ol 3 % monate. La demagoga tatestro instigas la popolon kredi
je la valoro de la valuto.<P>
En tiu lando de 150 milionoj da homoj kie malpli ol 50 milionoj
havas certan aetpovon kaj 100 milionoj mizeras, instaliis
oficiala uzuro: pli ol 30 % da reala kapitala interezo jare
(t.e. rento minus inflacio, vidu la grafikaon). Fronte al
tiu logo, eksterlandaj kapitaloj facile alfluas, sed multe pli
kiel spekula kapitalo ol kiel produktada investo. Ili saltas
de la negativa 6 % en Meksiko al falso pluso de 30 % en Brazilo.<P>
Pro la globaj kapitalfluoj dum la pasintaj 5 jaroj la
malgrandaj brazilaj entreprenoj u bankrotis, u
proprainiciate fermis siajn pordojn. La deorantaj
ekonomikistoj ne konscias, ke la ekonomio estas scienco, kiu
celas la produktadon kaj distribuadon de varoj por la
kontentigo de la homaj bezonoj. La evidentao pri abundo-cela
produkto-sistemo por sociala justo ne trafis ilian menson. Ili
kontrae insistas por konservi la kapitalisman spekuladon kaj
indiferentas fronte al la detruo, kiun ili provokas. Tiel la
giganta dormanto neniam vekios.</I><P>

<H2><I>Ekuo ne, u jes eroo a esperanto?</I></H2>
<H4>Fine de septembro ministroj de la Eropa Unio neformale
kunvenis en la hispana urbo Valencia por diskuti pri la Ekonomia
kaj Mona Unio, kiu laplane ekfunkciu je la 1a de januaro 1999.
Ili konfirmis tiun startdaton, almena por la membroj, kiuj jam
en 1998 plenumos la kriteriojn fiksitajn en la traktato de
Maastricht.</H4>
<I><P>
Mi bone memoras, ke irka la jaro 1980 mi estis konvinkita, ke
post nur kelkaj jaroj estos unu eropa valuto kaj ne plu
necesos unue viziti bankon anta ol transiri landlimon.
Bedarinde dum la pasintaj du jardekoj nenio aniis kaj
antavideblas ke, kun la nuna politiko, ni devos vivi en
``ekonomia unio'' kun pli ol dek diversaj valutoj. Estas klare,
ke e la ministroj ne plu kredas je siaj promesoj.<P>
Iam estis esperigaj signaloj. Por la estonta eropa mono oni
proponis la nomon ``ekuo''. Estis bela kompromiso: ``cu'' estas
monero iam uzita en pluraj regionoj de la nuna EU kaj samtempe
i estis mallongigo de la anglalingva termino</I> european
currency unit <I>(eropa monunuo). Ekuo iis enerale
akceptata vorto (kvankam ne jam estas ekuo-bankbiletoj, jes
ekzistas diversaj invest-ebloj en ekuoj) kaj simpluloj kiel mi
kredis, ke almena pri la nomo de nia estonta mono ne plu
necesis diskuti.<P>
Elrevigo venis anta iom da tempo, kiam germana politikisto
lanis la esprimon ``Esperantomono'' kun signifo ``monao''.
Samtempe el la sama direkto venis aserto, ke ``ekuo'' estas
neakceptebla vorto kaj ke oni seru iun alian, eble ``ero''
a, prefere, eromarko. Mi ja komprenas, ke la germanoj ne
atas perdi sian privilegiitan situacion. Ili estas la nuraj
eropanoj kiuj sen tro da problemoj kapablas vojai
eksterlanden kunportante nur siajn proprajn markojn. Sed u
la politikistoj ne intence stimulas tiun malemon, por forigi la
atenton de la aliaj problemoj en Germanio? La enketo farita
komence de septembro de la franca instituto Sofres, 51 % --- do
plimulto --- de la germanoj volonte akceptos novan monunuon.
Belgoj kaj francoj estas ankora pli favoraj: 77 %.<P>
Dum la pasintaj jaroj plejparto de la EU-membroj kvaza blinde
sekvis la germanan ekonomian politikon. La kriterioj por la
mona unio devigis iujn imiti la germanan ekzemplon, sed u
i dare restas imitenda? La kostoj por rekonstruo de
orienta Germanio ege plialtigis la tatajn uldojn --- la
maksimumo la la Traktato de Maastricht estas preska
atingita. Nun abundas ekonomiaj problemoj, foje e
skandaloj. Germanio ne plu havas elstare fidindan
ekonomian sistemon. Aliflanke, kun modernigitaj industrioj
enlande, kaj malmultekostaj subkontraktantoj kaj grandega
eksportmerkato oriente, perfekte eblas nova</I> Wirtschaftswunder
<I>(ekonomia miraklo).<P>
Alia demando: u la kriterioj fiksitaj anta kvin jaroj de
teknikistoj ankora validas? La mondo aniis kaj la
problemoj komplikiis. La sovetia malamiko estas for, sed
tute ne venis pli granda ekonomia a politika stabileco.
Malgra plej modernaj ekipaoj la NATO-armeoj estas tute
senpovaj kiam ie ekas milito. Anka interne de la EU disio
superas kunion. Apena io rilate al pli unueca ekonomia kaj
fiska politiko estas realigita. Luksemburgo restas parazito de
la belga kaj germana ekonomioj; cetere anka plejparto de la
aliaj membroj dorlotas etajn fiskajn paradizojn. La civitanoj,
multfoje trompitaj per nerealigitaj promesoj de erokratoj,
iis malpli eropemaj.<P>
Momente nur Germanio kaj Luksemburgo estas pretaj por transiro
al mona unio. Grekio kaj Italio neniel estas pretaj.
Plejparto de la aliaj landoj havas bonajn ciferojn por inflacio
(maksimume 3,4 %) kaj rentonivelo (maksimume 10,5 %), sed tiuj
dependas de eksteraj faktoroj nekontroleblaj de la EU.
Ekzemple inflacio estas malalta pro enerala ekonomia situacio
kaj pro malaltaj prezoj de energio (parte sekvo de malalta
USD). Politiko pri parado de energio restas teoria; subita
prezaltio de nafto kazos saman krizegon kiel anta du
jardekoj.<P>
Ni imagu ke, malgra io, en 1999 deko da landoj estos pretaj
por la komuna valuto kaj ke la tiea loantaro estos favora al
la ideo. Kio okazos al la landoj kiuj ne estas pretaj? u
tiuj dronu? A u la riaj fratoj kun iom da prokrasto
tamen devos lasi ilin alii, sen konsideri kriteriojn?<P>
Ne iuj procentaoj, sed la opinio de la loantaro de iu lando
estu decidiga faktoro por krei monan union. Se sukcese, la
aliaj --- e germanoj kaj britoj --- rapide alios. Se
malsukcese, ni estu realismaj kaj zorge preparu la dispecigon
de Eropo.<P>

<H2><I>inio - Hongkongo</I></H2>
<H3>Unu lando kun du sistemoj</H3>
Hongkongo estas tutmonde konata pro
sia grava rolo en la internacia komerco. Lastatempe ne nur
hongkonganoj, sed anka alilandanoj dubas, u Hongkongo ankora
restos stabila kaj prospera post julio de 1997, kiam la ina Popola
Respubliko (PR) transprenos la suverenecon sur Hongkongo de la
britoj.<P>
Por forigi la dubon la ina efministro Li Pen montris ke,
konsiderinte la historion kaj nunan situacion de Hongkongo, la
PR praktikos la kapitalisman sistemon en Hongkongo, por ke i
dare estu centro de internaciaj financo kaj komerco kaj ponto
inter inio kaj la cetera mondo.<P>
Tia lando kun du sistemoj estis elpensita de la iama eminenta
ina gvidanto Deng Xiaopin [japjin], honorita kiel la enerala
projektanto de la ina modernigo. PR ellaboris serion da leoj
tagaj por Hongkongo kaj starigis specialan preparan komitaton
konsistantan el diversflankaj personoj. Li Pen fine asertis, ke
la departementoj de PR kaj iaj provincoj kaj municipoj ne havos
rajton interveni en la internajn aferojn de Hongkongo.<BR>

<H3>ZAIRIO</H3>
<H2><I>Mono de simio</I></H2>
En 1960, post la sendependio, Zairio aliis al la franka zono
kaj ia monunuo iis la franko kongola. En 1967, kun la
transformoj de prezidanto Mobutu, ekestis propra zairia mono, la
zairo (ZRZ). Pro tio Zairio perdis la protekton de la efaj
landoj de la franko-zono: Francio, Belgio kaj Svislando. En la
komenca periodo unu zairo valoris tri usonajn dolarojn (USD) kaj
dum kvin jaroj i bone servis al la zairia ekonomio. Ja ankora
estis sufie da riecoj postlasitaj de la belgaj koloniistoj kaj
la plej granda mineja entrepreno de la lando bonfartis.<P>
Depost 1973, pro la ``zairiigado'' (kiu transigis entreprenojn
posedatajn de alilandanoj al zairianoj) la zairo spertis
devalutojn kaj reformojn. En 1990, 30 jarojn post la fino de la
koloniado, unu dolaro kostis centmilojn da zairoj.<P>
La lukto por la povo okaze de la demokratiiga procezo alportis
profundan krizon kaj la zairo kvaza ne plu ekzistis. Oni ne plu
havis konfidon al la banka sistemo kaj konservis sian monon
hejme. En vendejoj la prezoj estis fiksitaj en alilanda mono
(dolaroj, francaj a belgaj frankoj). Simile okazis por ekonomiaj
kontraktoj kaj salajroj de privataj entreprenoj.<P>
Plej alarma fenomeno estis la metodo de interano de zairoj al
alilanda mono. Kutime, por havi devizojn, la komercistoj iris al
la bankoj, sed en la nuna Zairio la bankoj ne havas sufie da
devizoj. Ekestis nova profesio: sur la stratoj oni trovas multajn
monanistojn.<P>
En novembro 1993 alvenis alia mona reformo. La registaro emisiis
la novan zairon (ZRN). Tri ZRN egalis al unu USD. Bedarinde, la
reformo estis malbone farita. Ne nur la mono dare devalutis, sed
anka estis personoj, precipe libananoj, kiuj falsis monon. Oni
devis atendi  Kengo, la nunan efministron, por forpeli ilin el
Zairio. En septembro 1995 unu USD kostis 8000 ZRN.<P>

<H2><I>La virino en la industrio</I></H2>
Nuntempe la belga ministro pri laboro Miet Smet klopodas ani
la leon pri malpermeso de noktolaboro por virinoj. En Belgio
estas enerale malpermesite al virinoj labori dum la nokto. Nur
flegistinoj kaj servistinoj en kafejoj a restoracioj rajtas
dumnokte labori. Tiu situacio bremsas la eblojn por virinoj en la
industrio kaj pluraj homoj sentas tion kiel diskriminacion. Anka
la Eropa Unio faris gvidlinion: la diversaj tatoj devas doni la
samajn rajtojn al virinoj kiel al viroj. En la diskutado oni ofte
uzas medicinajn kriteriojn, kiel la demandon u ekzistas tiel
specifaj efikoj en la industrio, ke la laboro por viroj estas
permesita sed ke la sama laboro estas malpermesita al virinoj?<P>
Viro kaj virino diferencas. La skeleto, la muskoloforto, la
grasodisdono estas diferencaj. Ekde la komenco de i tiu jarcento
oni scias, ke ne nur la ekstera formo estas diferenca, sed iu
elo. e la virino, iu elo havas (2x22)+XX kromosomojn, e la
viro (2x22)+XY . ajnas logike supozi, ke tiel granda diferenco,
ekzistanta en iu elo de la korpo, anka sekvigas diferencajn
fizikajn eblojn kaj e psikajn kondutojn. Tamen, oni devas
relativigi tiajn deirpunktojn de biologia determinado. Pro multaj
faktoroj, la individuaj diferencoj en unu sekso estas pli grandaj
ol la diferencoj inter la averao de la du seksoj. Tiu konstato
konsistigas fortan argumenton por ke la specialaj eneralaj
aranoj, kreitaj por la protekto de virinoj, estu modifitaj al
rekta protektado de iu malforta individuo. La dubo pri la
biologia determinismo estis bone esprimita de Simone de Beauvoir
en 1946. En sia studo ``La dua sekso'' <I>(Le deuxicme sexe) </B></U></I>i
argumentas, ke oni ne naskias kiel virino, sed ke oni farias
tio per la edukado. Kvankam ia studo precipe estas
sociologia studo, oni tamen povas diri, ke pluraj biologiaj faktoj
montras la saman pensdirekton. iu viro havas karakterizajn
virinajn trajtojn, iu virino havas karakterizajn virajn. iu
viro havas virinajn hormonojn, iu virino havas virajn hormonojn.
<H3>Laboraj cirkonstancoj</H3>
Faktoroj kiuj kondias laborcirkonstancojn povas esti
dividitaj en korpaj, percepto-mensaj, fizikaj (bruo, radiado),
kemiaj, biologiaj (bakterioj, virusoj) kaj psiko-sociaj
(atendoj, esperoj) faktoroj. Gravedeco konsistigas tiom
fundamentan diferencon inter la du seksoj, ke tiu devas esti
traktata aparte.
<UL>
<LI>Korpaj faktoroj:
Meznombre, la virino estas 13 centimetrojn pli malgranda ol la
viro. iaj membroj estas 10 % pli malgrandaj, ia muskoloforto,
ia spirkapablo, la oksigeno-sorbo en la sango estas malpli
grandaj ol e la viro. La korpaj ebloj estas 20 is 24 % malpli
grandaj ol e la viro. Pro la strukturo de la pelvo kaj la lokado
de la gamboj, stari longtempe estus pli malfacila por virinoj ol
por viroj: pro tio, peza laboro ne estas postulita de virinoj en
evoluintaj landoj, krom dum militotempo. Tamen, iam virinoj faris
pezan laboron. Dum la antaa jarcento virinoj laboris en
karbominejoj, kaj la laborcirkonstancoj estis tiel fifamaj, ke en
Britio en 1840 parlamenta komisiono ekzamenis la situacion. En
tiu komisiono troviis anka kuracisto, Southwood Smith, kiu
faris desegnaojn, ar la parlamentanoj ne legas normalan
skribaon, li diris. Desegnaoj estus pli rapide rigardataj.
Anka nuntempe la bildoj aspektas okaj: virinoj kaj infanoj kiuj
karbon lalonge de tupetaroj supren portas. La raporto de la
komisiono sukcesis. Jam en 1844 nova leo,<I> Mines Act</I> (Leo pri
minejoj) aperis: la laboro subtera de virinoj kaj knabinoj estis
komplete malpermesita. Knaboj je la ao de 10 jaroj darigis tiun
laboron. La kialo de la malpermeso por knabinoj kaj virinoj ne
sekvis rekte el la pezo de la laboro sed pro ilia estonta rolo
kiel patrino. La raporto diris: ``La laborigo de inaj infanoj
havas efikon ke, kiam ili poste edzinios, la edzino ne posedos
la necesan scion por rezervi al sia edzo la kutiman hejmecan
komforton ...''<I> (The employment of female children has the effect
that when they come to marry, the wife possesses not the
knowledge to enable her to give her husband the common comforts
of a home ...)<P>
</I>Germanio sekvis per simila leo en 1878, Nederlando en 1889 kaj
Francio en 1892. En tiuj du lastaj landoj noktolaboro estis
malpermesita pro la sama kialo.
<P>
<LI>Percepto-mensaj faktoroj:
En malnovaj libroj pri medicino de la laboro, la virino estis
priskribita kiel pli obstina ol la viro kaj pro tio pli taga por
elteni altan ripetan labortempon dum mallongaj periodoj. La
atoroj avertis pri la danero de troaro. ia enrigardema naturo
ebligas al i rezisti pli facile al monotona ripetada laboro.
Kiagrade tia sinteno rezultas de tradicio kaj edukado, estas
malfacile precizigeble.
<P>
<LI>Fizikaj, biologiaj kaj kemiaj faktoroj:
Temas pri vibradoj, bruo, radiado kiel fizikaj, pri protozooj,
bakterioj, virusoj kiel biologiaj kaj pri aktivaj kemiaj
substancoj kiel kemiaj faktoroj.<P>
Se la ekspono estas simila por amba, ne ekzistas pli granda
sentemo al fizikaj a biologiaj faktoroj por laboro-malsanoj e
la virino ol e la viro. Rilate al kemiaj faktoroj, la situacio
estas pli komplika: la pli malalta koncentrio de hemoglobino
(substanco por transporti oksigenon en la sango) e la virino
sentivigas in al plumbotokso. Nuntempe la permesitaj normoj
estas tiom rigoraj, ke la danero de malsano por la du seksoj
praktike ne plu ekzistas.
<P>
<LI>Psiko-sociaj faktoroj:
Virinoj - same kiel viroj - prave volas mem realigi kaj valorigi
siajn diplomojn. Krome, restas la zorga funkcio de patrino kaj
edzino. Tiu tiel nomata ``dorlotada funkcio'' estas precipe en tiu
i jarcento pligrandianta. La eblo de konfliktoj inter interesoj
estas tamen pli granda ol en la patrorolo, parte pro la korpa
kunteksto, parte pro la atendoj de la irkaao. La rezultanta
psika tensio e la koncerna virino ne estu subtaksita. Finfine,
temas pri la vivkvalito. Vivkvalito povas esti difinita kiel la
eblo disponi pri rimedoj por fari tiujn aferojn kiuj gravas al la
individuo. En malcedemaj strukturoj certe ekzistas la sento de
manko a neperfekteco. Troaro povas aperi pro tio, ke oni ne plu
povas vivi la sia propra vivoritmo, sed iam estas instigata per
la atendoj kaj supozoj de sia irkaao. Dek du horoj en la tago
por si mem - mani kaj dormi inkluzive - ajnas minimumo.<P>
</UL>
<H3>Gravedio kaj laboro</H3>
Pro la naskrolo de la virino, aperis multaj
protektataj aranoj rilate korpan aron kaj irkaajn influojn.
En preska iuj landoj gravedeco donas sendevigon de laboro dum
pluraj semajnoj. La protekto-aranoj dum la gravedeco ofte
datias de la tempo kiam la laborhigieno ne jam estis evoluigita
kaj mankis eneralaj preskriboj. Ekzemplo estas la malpermeso
labori en minoj, la malpermeso rilate pezajn transportojn, la
malpermeso de nokto-laboro, ktp. Nuntempe estas pli facile agi
rekte kaj eventualajn malpermesojn subteni per baza scio. En
Germanio, la malpermeso pri noktolaboro estis nuligita en 1992.
Samtempe, kun la nuligo de eneralaj malpermesoj, estiis novaj
reguloj pri specifaj substancoj a situacioj. Post la dramo de
talidomido (medikamento kiu okazigas misformojn en la feto) oni
konsciiis pri la danero de kemiaj substancoj. Anka la danero
de radioaktiva radiado estis konata certe post Hiroimo kaj
Nagasako. La Eropa Unio faris direktivon tiurilate, kiun la
diversaj membrotatoj devas akcepti en sia ledonado. Tiu
direktivo enhavas liston de kemiaj substancoj (hidrargo, plumbo,
formaldehido, ktp.), radioaktivaj radiadoj kaj laborsituacioj al
kiuj gravedaj virinoj ne estu submetitaj.<P>
Krom la kemiaj, fizikaj kaj biologiaj faktoroj ekzistas nuntempe
pli granda interesio pri psikaj faktoroj dum la gravedeco.
Pozitivaj efikoj de la laborejo estas sendube kamaradeco kaj la
facilaoj en la entrepreno, kiujn la virino hejme ne havas.
Malbonaj efikoj estis studataj e resusoj. Eksperimentoj
pruvas, ke aktivigo de la graveda simio kondukas al malpliigo de
sango en la feto. Anka la acidogrado de la fetosango kreskas.
Fortaj fizikaj ekzercoj kiel en profesia supersporto malkreskigas
la sangoprovizon en la pelvo kun la samaj sekvoj.
<H3>Konsideri cirkonstancojn</H3>
Virinoj ofte estas katalogitaj kiel vundebla grupo. Tio okazis
multfoje surbaze de dubaj informoj. Malgra sia malpli granda
muskoloforto, la virino havas enerale pli da rezisto ol viro kaj
kutime vivas pli longe. Tamen, dum la reprodukta periodo,
virino estas vundebla de gonadotoksaj substancoj (risko kiun i
dividas kun viro) kaj de fetotoksaj substancoj (risko kiu nur
ekzistas e gravedulinoj). Samtempe estu dirite, ke la virino
pli ofte okupias ol viro pri la hejmo. Pro tio, ia labortago
estas ofte 4 is 6 horojn pli longa ol tiu de la edzo. Konklude
oni povas diri, ke virinoj certe havas la samajn kapablojn kiel
viroj por labori en industrio, sed oni devas konsideri specifajn
cirkonstancojn por ili.<P>

<H2><I>Bonvolu literumi!</I></H2>
Malmultaj homoj aplikas Esperanton en sia profesia medio. Okazas
sendube anka sufie malofte, ke firmao alprenas Esperanton kiel
aldonan firmaan lingvon por komuniki kun siaj klientoj. La
Germana firmao <I>Professional Consulting</I> (apelilo) tamen dum
pluraj monatoj faris tion. La akiritaj lingvaj spertoj estis
sufie interesaj kaj salde pozitivaj. Tamen estis unu elstare
negativa sperto rilatanta al tre baza afero. Telefonado!<P>
Estas klare, ke multaj Esperantistoj ne tiom bone parolas
Esperanton kiom eble sian gepatran nacian lingvon. Tio evidente
kondukas al miskomprenkazitaj ripetoj estigantaj nenecese
longajn dialogojn por forigi iujn malklaraojn. Jen afero ne
evitebla en la nuna fazo de la lingvo. Tamen la iutaga praktiko
pri la telefona akcepto de mendoj tre rapide elmontris aldonan
ege pli akre sperteblan malfacilon, kiu estas vere ne necesa kaj
tre ena. La Esperantaj liternomoj plene maltagas por telefona
komunikado.<P>
Ilustre jen specimeno de tipa tamen fakte fikcia dialogo:<P>
- ``Vi volas mendi unu ekzempleron, bonege. Kiel vi nomias?''<BR>
- ``gsnr!''<BR>
- ``Kiel?''<BR>
- ``nnfrt gsnr! Oni povas anka prononci ksngr!''<BR>
- ``La lineo estas tre malbona. Mi petas literumi.''<BR>
- ``'o a 'o 'o 'o e 'o - 'o i 'o 'o e 'o 'o e 'o.''<BR>
- ``Mi petas ripeti ege klare.''<BR>
- ``mno a mno fvo rlo e dto - gko i szo szo e mno
gko e lro.''<BR>
- ``Do maino, ''<BR>
- ``Kia maino? Mi havas mainon 486DX2-66 de Vobis.''<BR>
- ``Ne! Mo kiel maino, A kiel asfalto, ''<BR>
- ``Kies falto?''<BR>
- ``AS-falto, No kiel naturo, Fo kiel fabriko, Ro kiel rekordo, E
kiel elemento, Do kiel doktoro! u uste?''<BR>
- ``Mi ne scias. Mi forgesis la komencon.''<P>
Efektive multaj klientoj tuj forlasis Esperanton por literumi -
klopodante solvi la dilemon a Angle, France a Germane. Estas
anka tute evidente, ke la liternomoj la la Fundamento ne povas
ne aosigi iun klopodon komuniki nomon kaj adreson per
literumado tra telefonlineo. La sama problemo ekestas en la kampo
de radiofonio. Anta nelonge Radio Astrujo klopodis diskonigi
sian Interretan adreson ``info@rai.ping.at'' etere. Senefike. Nia
o-eca liternomaro e sub perfektaj kondioj estas apena
komprenebla kaj mallongonde senescepte fiaskigas iun, kiu
strebas apliki in. Aldona problemo estias distingi la ciferojn
``ses'' kaj ``sep'', speciale en kombinoj kiel ``sescent'' kaj
``sepcent''. Por solvi tion, oni eble renomu ``ses'' al ``sis'' nur por
ciferumadaj aplikoj. (En la Germana oni faras tion por distingi
inter ``zwei'' kaj ``drei'', ciferumade aplikante ``zwo''.) iukaze en
la apeliloperaca telefonia praktiko la notado de nomo kaj adreso
de kliento daris tipe dek is dek kvin minutojn pro la plene
malsukcesaj provoj litere iel ajn interkomprenii kun la
mendanto.<P>
Specifa kliento lois en la certe bela Sveda marborda urbo
Skelleftea. Mi uras, ke ne estis eble per Esperanto telefone
komuniki tiun fakton. Nur postesploro en atatlaso permesis
identigi la urbnomon kaj garantii ties ustan ortografion. E
pli akraj problemoj regule estiis rilate Japanajn nomojn kaj
adresojn en ties diverssistemaj latinliteraj transskriboj.
<H4>La normalo</H4>
La normala situacio en nacilingva medio estas literumi per
iutagaj liternomoj. Oni nur tre esceptokaze a en profesia
radiofonia medio utiligas iun alian specialan rimedon. La averaa
homo tamen simple literumas per la parolalfabeto, kiun li lernis
kiel ABC-uleto en sia unua lerneja klaso. Per nacilingva alfabeto
tio plej ofte bonete sukcesas, ar enerale la liternomoj sone
sufie diveras - ekzemple inter iu ``ef'' kaj iu ``va'' a inter iu
``ka'' kaj iu ``ge'' ne estias granda konfuzo. Aparte de tio oni
normale pli a malpli konas la celatan vorton literumatan kaj pro
tio povas tuj diveni iujn misaditajn a mankajn literojn. E
kiam la literumata vorto ne estas konata, i tamen plej ofte
obeas al la enerala strukturo kaj tradicia ortografio de la
aplikata nacia lingvo.<P>
En la Esperanta medio tamen la situacio prezentias ege alia.
Kutime oni tute ne celas literumi Esperantaon, necesias
literumi iun nacilingvaon. Tiu fremdao memkompreneble tute ne
obeas a e kontraas la strukturon kaj ortografion de la lingvo
media. Aldone tio okazas ne malofte trans grandajn distancojn per
telefono, ar la Esperantista komunumo estas tre dise
distribuiinta. Rekte en tiuj kondioj estas evidente, ke
parolalfabeto la la skemo:<P>
a, bo, co, o, do, e, fo, go, o, ho, o, i, jo, o, ko, lo, mo,
no, o, po, ro, so, o, to, u, u hoka, vo, zo<P>
pro sia samsoneco tute ne tagas. La malfacilo sone distingi
inter go kaj ko, bo kaj po, mo kaj no, kaj inter pluraj aliaj
similaj paroj, estas en la praktiko ne venkebla. Aliflanke la
enhavo de la literumatao preska certe ne liveros iun indikon
pri ebla necesa korektado de iuj misnotitaj literoj. Bedarinde
oni ne literumas vorton kiel ``elefanto'', kiun ja iu bonege
konas. Temas pri iu fremda nomo a adresero, do pri literume tute
ne konata tereno de la vidpunkto de la askultanto.
<H4>u zo, za, zet, ze a zu?</H4>
Do nia parolalfabeto, kvankam ege facile parkerigebla, plene
fiaskas en la praktiko. iu emia formulo, iu algebrao, iu
entreprena mallongilo kaj iu klopodo komuniki la literaranon de
fremda vorto dronas en maro da apena distingeblaj o-oj. Evidente
tiu problemo ne unue estiis en la hodiaa epoko. i akompanas
nin ekde jarcento kaj pro tio ekzistas jam kelkaj proponoj ortigi
tiun iomete oblikvan Fundamentan foston de nia lingvo. Mi citu
tri ekzemplojn el PAG-o.<P>
Jen propono de Varengjeno - celanta ne tro forlasi la Fundamenton
kaj tamen atingi kompreneblecon:<P>
a, ba, co, o, da, e, fo, ga, a, ha, o, i, jo, a, ko, lo, mo,
na, o, po, ra, so, o, to, u, a, va, za.<P>
Jen propono de d-ro Belinfante - celanta internaciecon:<P>
a, be, ce, e, de, e, ef, ge, o, ha, a, i, jot, e, ka, el, em,
en, o, pe, er, es, a, te, u, o, vi, zet.<P>
Jen propono de Kaloajo - miaopinie la plej bona - celanta kaj
internaciecon, kaj kompreneblecon:<P>
a, be, ce, a, de, e, ef, ge, e, ha, i, i, je, i, ka, el, om,
en, o, pa, er, es, e, ta, u, o, ve, ze.<P>
Jen plia interesa propono aperinta iam sur mia komputila ekrano
el la reto elpense de nekonata atoro. i evidente celas logikon
kaj lerneblon, tamen iomete kompromisas rilate kompreneblon:<P>
a, ba, ca, a, da, e, fe, ge, e, he, e, i, ji, i, ki, li, mi,
ni, o, po, ro, so, to, u, u, vu, zu.
<H4>Tro da ekuoj ...</H4>
La leganto sin eble jam demandas, kial oni enas lian pacon per
afero estanta tiom plene flanka, tiom triviala kaj tiom
sensignifa. Bedarinde tamen tute ne temas pri iu marena
makuleto. En realo tio estas tre grava lingva manko. Evidente
estas en komerca medio ege problemige, se aetema kliento simple
ne sukcesas dum akceptebla tempodaro komuniki sian adreson al la
ekspedema liveranto. Oni pripensu, ke internacia telefonado ne
okazas didonace kaj la kosto por dekminuta telefonkonversacio
ekzemple de Japanujo al Germanujo estas ja altega. Okaze de
mendado temas pri klienta elspezo, kiu plialtias kun iu
malparita sekundo. Post specifa tempodaro la kliento komencas
frustrii kaj iom pli poste e kolerios pro tiu nerva malsukceso
komprenigi sin. Aldone li tre balda konsciios pri sia atendata
telefonfakturo, ar lia mono simple tiktakas for. La rezulto
estas de reklamada kaj vendada vidpunkto katastrofa. La
normalokaze tre ojiga ago mendi belan kaj sopiratan produkton
endanerias psie bumerangi kiel negativa kaj malagrabla sperto.
Alivorte la konversacio ias tiom agaca, kiom senutilaj restas la
klopodoj kompreneble komuniki la propran nomon. Oni rimarkas
tion, kiam la mendanto komencas insisti tamen sendi sian mendon
letere.<P>
Tiu nekapablo efike literumi en Esperanto estas ne
preteratentebla malavantao en komerco kaj negoco. Se oni fakte
Eropvaste enkondukus Esperanton, tiu lingva manko estigus
aldonajn telefonkostojn je megaekuoj kaj malparus konsiderindan
kapaciton de niaj lineoj. Tiu manko estas malakceptenda.
<H4>... por maltro da kuoj</H4>
Kaje onin rekte frapas la fakto, ke iuj is nun menciitaj
proponoj celas literumi Esperanton. En la praktiko tamen uste
tio neniam necesias. Por nacilingvaoj la Esperanta literaro mem
ne malofte malsufias pro sia manko de amplekso. Krom Q, W, X kaj
Y mankas &#223; kaj multaj aliaj Latinidaj literoj kun
aldonaj signetoj. Kie Esperanto alfabete posedas pli, la literoj
estas ne utiligeblaj rilate fremdaojn, ar la plej multaj
lingvoj aplikas por la sama celo a literkombinojn, a
supersignitaojn. Ambakaze la Esperantaj , , ,  kaj  trafas
aeron, ar tiuj aldonaj alfabeteroj universe unikas.<P>
Konstatiu anka, ke lanorma estas nur la alfabeto Zamenhofa -
a, bo, co, do, ktp. Aliflanke, ekkoninte la problemon kaj ties
komercan signifikecon, firmao povus perfektigi sian internajn
rimedojn por literumado laplae kaj tio povus okazi sen iu
retenemo devojii ajndistance de la normo. De entreprena pozicio
tio estus defendebla, ar ja ``Temp' estas mono''. Sed la dilemo e
tia entreprena solvo estus tio, ke por vere sukcesi la elektitan
enkondukotan metodon devus koni anka la klientaro. Evidente oni
ne povus antamende distribui iujn alfabetslipojn al iuj
supozate mendemaj Esperantistoj. Sekve oni bezonas rimedon, kiu
tuj iel pli a malpli bone funkcios, kaj, se tio ne estas
centcentone ebla, do funkcios minimume en la retrodirekto por
kontroli, u la notitaj klientaj datumoj estas ortografie ustaj.
Tiu iokuracilo nepre ekfunkciu sen iu antaa trejnado de la
klientoj a alispeca speciala averto.<P>
De tiu lasta postulo sekvas, ke adaptii al novaj liternomoj
neege povos esti akceptebla solvo, ar neniu kliento intuicie tuj
komprenus ilin. Regus nur e pli da telefonada konfuzo. E se la
Akademio oficiale propagandus iujn pli konvenajn novajn
liternomojn, la ano restus probable tre tabua. Aldone iuj
lernolibroj ekestus per unu frapo rilate la alfabeton
malaktualaj. Kaj lastvice ee kaj see - e se la afero komune
decidius, la transiro al popola akcepto probable darus jarojn.
<H4>Saa kapo duonvorton komprenas</H4>
Se ni rezignu renomi niajn literojn, do restas rimede nur elekti
iun paralelan solvon. La plej simpla rimedo estas starigi liston
da vortoj, en kiu iu vorto substituias al litero. Tiel estias
vortalfabeto - kvaza la-Zamenhofe kiel la titola proverbo nin
instruas. Tamen tiom frape nova tiu propono memkompreneble ne
estas kaj efektive vortalfabetoj ekzistas jam pluraj. Specimene
jen vortalfabeto el la vortaro Germana-Esperanta de Krazo:<P>
Asfalto, Barbaro, Centimetro, efo, Doktoro, Elemento, Fabriko,
Gumo, irafo, Hotelo, aoso, Insekto, Jubileo, urnalo,
Kilogramo, Legendo, Maino, Naturo, Omnibuso, Papero, Rekordo,
Salato, ilingo, Triumfo, Universo, Universo-hoko, Vulkano,
Zinko.<P>
Fakte nia firmao provizore provis apliki tiun vortalfabeton -
provizore interalie pro tio, ke la alfabetslipo netroveble kais
sin en preska iu okazo de bezono. Montriis tamen en la fakte
restanta praktiko tri malavantaoj. Unue preska iuj vortoj
estas trisilabaj kaj kelkaj el ili fieras pri e kvara. Kunsekve
la vortero portanta la plej gravan datumon - nome la
anstataigitan literon - estas sen akcento kaj pro tio ne bone
adebla. Due pro sia plursilabeco iuj vortoj estas tro longaj
por vere rapide kaj kostopare telefone literumi. Ili bremsas la
parolfluon. Trie la vokalo de la lasta silabo portas neniun
distingan informaon, estante iam la identa substantiva
gramatika finao. Informafakulo tuj diagnozos, ke tia liste ie
samloke gastanta vokalo estas redundanca.<P>
Proponias anka pluraj aliaj vortalfabetoj, tamen ili iuj
suferas je la samaj mankoj. Akcente ili entenas amason da
amfibrakoj (ekz. Doktoro) kaj tro da anapestoj (ekz. Centimetro).
Pro tio ili tre malkonvene malemfazas la plej gravan silabon.
Estas konkludeble, ke pro tio, ke en Esperanto la akcento iam
estas sur la antalasta silabo de vorto, kaj, pro tio, ke la plej
informporta silabo prefere akcentiu, tagas nur trokeoj (ekz.
Gumo).<P>
Eble ni e tiu punkto envie gvatu trans la ardenan barilon al
nia Angla najbaro en Transgentujo. Jen la internacia vortalfabeto
por flugtrafika komunikado:<P>
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India,
Juliet, Kilo, Lima, Mike, November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec, Romeo,
Sierra, Tango, Uniform, Victor, Whiskey, Xray, Yankee, Zulu<P>
La avantaoj estas evidentaj. iu elektita vorto estas konciza,
la akcento estas preska senescepte sur la literume plej grava
silabo kaj iu termino estas sufie ne miskomprenebla. Nur
``November'' akcente iom devojias, estante kiel en Esperanto
amfibrako.
<H4>Saa vorto duonkapon komprenigas</H4>
Vortalfabeto por Esperanto tamen ne necese estu pli senefika ol
vortalfabeto por la Angla a por iu alia lingvo. Por optimume
solvi la aferon oni evidente same prenu dusilabaojn, do
trokeojn. Per tiu rimedo la literindika silabo lacele portos la
akcenton. La elekton de la individuaj vortoj tamen oni ne lasu al
la hazardo. Post iom da pripenso oni ekkonos, ke taga literumada
alfabeto nepre obeu al la sekva listo da postuloj:<P>
1 - La unua litero egalu la prezentatan literon. Alivorte -
kuo, ikso, ipsilono - ne vere tagas. 2 - La nomo estu dusilaba.
Alivorte - hipopotamino - ne tagas. 3 - La nomo estu iutaga
Fundamenta vorto. Alivorte - dista, turpa - ne tagas. 4 - Se oni
kaas la unuan literon, oni nepre kun certeco povu diveni in de
la ceteraj literoj. Alivorte - lago, tago, pago - ne tagas. 5 -
La nomoj de voaj kaj senvoaj a alispece similsonaj konsonantoj
maksimume diveru. Alivorte - eno, emo, pagi, baki, - ne
tagas. 6 - La unua vokalo de iuj nomoj distribuiu en la listo
egale. 7 - La dua vokalo de iuj nomoj distribuiu en la listo
egale. 8 - Ne estu konsonantoduo kiel eksono de la nomo. Alivorte
- rabo, skrapi, strando, planko, granda - ne tagas. 9 -
Forvio de la unua litero ne estigu alian eblan vorton. Alivorte
- t-ago, g-randa, -erpi - ne tagas. 10 - Aldono de plia litero
antae ne estigu alian eblan vorton. Alivorte - (k)(l)ano,
(g)emo, (e)(k)rano - ne tagas.<P>
Tiu devizdeko por vortelekto garantios, ke la vortoj sone
maksimume diveros, kaj samtempe permesos seneraran identigon en
misadigema medio.<P>
Vortalfabeto obeanta maksimuman nombron de la supraj kriterioj
estas la jena:<P>
Akvo, Balda, Cedro, irka, Dola, Eo, Fajfi, Golfo, is,
Hejme, oro, Ii, Jato, uri, Korpo, Lingvo, Morga, Nokto,
Ofte, Pelvo, Ria, Sankta, ami, Tempo, Uzi, a-a, Vespo, Zorgi<P>
Nur la substituoj ``oro'' (4, 9), ``is'' (2), ``Jato'' (3) kaj ``Uzi''
(10) ne sukcesas obei iujn kriteriojn. Aldone la hundobleka
``a-a'' estas ja Zamenhofa, tamen ne Fundamenta.<P>
Aldoniu ankora Q - kuo, W - vavo, X - ikso, Y - ipsilono,  -
So-Zo Germana kaj kombinoj kun signetoj la la skemo: Eo kun
streketo supren, Eo kun streketo malsupren, Akvo kun ringeto,
Ofte kun trastreko, Ofte kun dupunkto (kuanta), Nokto kun
ondeto, Uzi kun tegmento kaj Cedro kun subhoko. Necesias kelkaj
pliaj liternomoj, interalie por la Islanda kaj pluraj Slavaj
lingvoj.<P>
La tasko starigi tian vortalfabeto montriis malfacila. La
leganto mem provu konstrui pli bonan. Iuj el la proponitaj
litervortoj jam tre proksime limas malobeon de la tria regulo
rilate iutagecon. Oni eble anka inklinas kritiki, ke mankas
regulo postulanta facilan prononceblon, sed tio estas la prezo
pagenda por samtempaj koncizo kaj percepta certeco. Tamen jen
sendube pli praktika solvo ol iuj isnunaj popularaj
vortalfabetoj. i konstrue spegulas iujn spertojn kaj ekkonojn
de la atoro pri la literumada problemo. Malfelie la apelila
projekto pro la neaetemo de la celata uzantaro ne kapablas
financi sin kaj pro tio i ne estos tre longe plu vivpova. Sekve
mankos la okazo por la atoro vere plu elprovi la novan literuman
alfabeton en la iutago. Do la tasko elprovi la sistemon restos
por aliulo.

<H2>Kiu murdis Dian Fossey?</H2>
Fine de decembro 1995 dek jaroj estos pasintaj post la tragika
morto de Dian Fossey, la fama protektantino de la goriloj,
persono kiu en pluraj medioj estas konsiderata kiel la martiro de
la naturprotektado. ia libro <I>Gorillas in the mist</I> (``Goriloj en
la nebulo'', aludanta pri la oftaj nebuloj en la ruandaj altmontaj
arbaroj), aperinta en 1983 kaj balda tradukita en plurajn
lingvojn, jam estis koniginta in internacie anta ia morto. Du
jarojn post tio anka samnoma filmo, kun en la efrolo la fama
aktorino Sigourney Weaver, havis internacian sukceson, sed i
fakte ne fidele prezentas la enhavon de la libro, nek la postajn
eventojn. Jam du libroj aperis pri ia morto: unu nefiniinta, de
la usonano Hayes, kaj en 1993 unu de la anglo Nicholas Gordon kun
la provoka titolo: <I>Murders in the mist.- Who killed Dian Fossey?</I>
(``Murdoj en la nebulo.- Kiu mortigis Dian Fossey?'' - aludo pri la
nebula stato en kiu estas ia morto kaj pluraj aliaj), iuspeca
detektiva romano.<P>
Multaj demandoj ja restas pri tio: Kiu murdis in en ia domo sur
la vulkanoj en Ruando? Kial dare restas duboj pri la verdikto de
la ruanda tribunalo, kiu indikis kaj kondamnis iun kulpulon, la
usonanon W. R. McGuire? u efektive pluraj personoj poste estis
murditaj, por ke oni ne konu la veran kulpulon?
<H4>Kiu estis Dian Fossey?</H4>
is 1966 la usona virino Dian Fossey, naskiinta en 1932, estis
simpla persono en la usona Louisville; i okupis sin pri
handikapitaj infanoj. Nur unufoje i faris vojaon ekster sia
lando: en 1963 al Afriko, kie i i.a. renkontis en Kenjo la faman
antropologon Richard Leakey, kaj kie i akompanis dum kelkaj
tagoj du britojn, kiuj deziris fotografi gorilojn en la
Virunga-parko de la tiama Kongo-Lopoldville (nun Zairio).<P>
Post ia vojao al Afriko, restis ia intereso pri la goriloj,
kaj i legis multon pri ili kaj anka pri la interesaj studoj de
la anglino Jane Goodall, kiu en Tanzanio dare observadis la
vivon de impanzoj en la naturo kaj atingis per tio tre
interesajn konstatojn. Dian revis pri iu simila studo pri la
goriloj, farota de i mem.<P>
Kiam Leakey venis prelegi en kelkaj usonaj universitatoj Dian
kontaktis lin kaj proponis, ke i faru similan studon pri la
goriloj. Leakey tute ne atis la ideon, ke sensperta, nescienca
virino iru instali sin en izola loko en Afriko, sed por ne oke
rifuzi in, li diris, ke pro mortorisko de neoperaciebla
apendicito nur homoj sen apendico povas iri loi tiel izole.
Kelkajn tagojn poste Dian iris al hospitalo kaj forprenigis sian
apendicon. Poste i skribis al Leakey, ke nun tiu malhelpo ne plu
ekzistas kaj ke i do povas ekagi. Leakey estis konsternita, sed
li admiris la entreprenemon kaj sindedion de tiu virino, kaj
tial li decidis doni al i ancon per monsumo kiun li hazarde
disponis. Tiel en la fino de 1966 la apena preparita Dian Fossey
vojais al Afriko kun la firma celo pristudi la konduton de la
goriloj en ilia vivmedio.<P>
Unue i instalis sin en Kabara, la vilao kiun i estis vizitinta
kelkajn jarojn antae kun la fotografiistoj; tiu loko situas en
Zairio sur flanko de la Virunga-vulkanoj, proksime de la punkto
kie renkontias la landlimoj de Zairio, Ugando kaj Ruando. Tie
jam kelkajn jarojn antae la usona etnologo B. Schaller estis
farinta interesan, sed tro mallongan, studperiodon pri la konduto
de goriloj kaj li estis montrinta, ke ili ne estas la kruelaj
monstroj kiel oni kutime kredas, sed pacemaj, afablaj bestoj. Jam
en Kabara Dian spertis, ke observi gorilojn ne estas tiel simple,
kiel i imagis, kaj ke la vivo en la tieaj cirkonstancoj estas
ekstreme malfacila.<P>
Kelkajn monatojn post ia alveno komenciis en tiu regiono
ribelado, gvidata de la belga aventurulo Jean Schramme. Soldatoj
de la zairia armeo, devantaj ``protekti'' la eksterlandanojn, venis
aresti Dian kaj tenis in en malliberejo is kiam venis iu zairia
armea altrangulo por ``privata interparolo''. Per iu truko (kiun i
bone priskribas en sia libro) i sukcesis eskapi kaj atingi
Ugandon. De tie i vojais al amikoj en Ruando. Tie i konstatis,
ke pli favoraj studeblecoj eble ekzistus en la ruanda parto de la
granda naturparko de la vulkanoj. Post iom da surloka esplorado
i instalis en septembro 1967 kelkajn kabanojn en la altnivela
valo (je 3000 m da altitudo) inter la vulkanoj Karisimbi kaj
Visoke, kaj nomis tiun lokon ``Karisoke''. Tie i plue vivis is
sia neatendita morto en 1985, do dum 18 jaroj, krom dum kelkaj
mallongaj periodoj en Usono kaj Britio.
<H4>En Karisoke</H4>
La ruanda Nacia Parko de la Vulkanoj, estigita de Belgio en 1926,
depost la sendependio de Ruando en 1962 estis en tragika stato.
Jam 40 centonoj estis cedita al agrikulturaj celoj por kontentigi
la kreskantan loantaron de la regiono, speciale de la hutua
etno. En la restanta parto de la parko pluraj tutsioj (alia etno)
patis siajn bovinojn. Nepermesita asado fare de la tvaoj (tria
etno, pigmeoj) okazis pli intense ol iam ajn antae
<A HREF="#noto1"> <SUP>1</SUP></A>. <A NAME="renoto1"> La
malmultaj parkgardistoj apena faris sian laboron kaj la superaj
instancoj montris nenian intereson por naturrezervejoj. En la
apuda urbo Ruhengeri peltoj de protektataj bestoj estis libere
vendataj, kaj kelkfoje kranioj a manoj de goriloj estis
prezentataj al la turistoj kiel suveniroj a magiaoj. Ne mirinde
ke la nombroj da goriloj kaj aliaj bestoj malkreskis timige.<P>
Kontra iuj tiuj faktoj Dian dum jaroj senespere batalis kaj
kampanjis, cele al savado de la goriloj kaj de la tuta rieco de
la naturrezervejo. ia batalo estis malfacila ar i ne scipovis
la lokan lingvon<I> (kinyarwanda)</I> kaj nur malbone la
okcident-afrikan vehiklan lingvon <I>(svahili)</I> a la administran
lingvon (la franca). Krome i apena konsciis pri la lokaj
tradicioj, pensmanieroj kaj vivbezonoj. Por defendi la gorilojn
i kelkfoje aplikis metodojn, kiuj la etika vidpunkto estas
apena permeseblaj. Por i goriloj estis pli gravaj ol homoj; i
e instalis apud sia domo tombejon kun memorsigno por iu
mortinta gorilo (en kiun oni cetere anka enterigis la junan
gorilon, kies nekropsion mi kaj kolego faris en majo 1986) kaj
kie i mem deziris esti entombigita (kio fakte okazis en decembro
1985).
<H4>La senvira solulino</H4>
La soleca vivo de blanka virino for de aliaj blankuloj en kabano
je pli ol 10 km de la plej proksima vilao estis tre suspekteme
rigardata de la loka loantaro, kiu kredis, ke i estas
soristino, kaj nomis in<I> Nyiramachabelli</I> (la senvira solulino en
la arbaro). Pli kaj pli i kredis sin mem la sola rajtigito de
naturrezervejo, en kiu prefere neniu alia venu, krom kelkaj
fideblaj kunlaborantoj kaj kelkaj nerifuzeblaj sciencistoj, sed
certe ne turistoj, patistoj a la veraj loantoj, la tvaoj.<P>
Kvankam Karisoke situas je nur kelkaj centoj da kilometroj de la
ekvatoro, sed je altitudo de pli ol 3000 m, la klimato ne estas
varma, estas e malvarme nokte; tre multe pluvas, kaj nebuloj
regas en la arbaroj, super la pli altaj herbejoj kaj super la
senherbaj duonpintoj de la vulkanoj, e kelkfoje neas. Oni tie
vivas en malseka, malvarmeta klimato kun malmulte da sunbrilo.
Nur malmultaj afrikanoj estis pretaj veni vivi en tiu loko, neniu
edzino akompanis la edzon, infanoj mankis tie. Vizitantoj estis
kiel eble plej multe rifuzataj.<P>
La multjara soleca vivo en tiu malfavora klimato ege influis la
karakteron kaj la sanstaton de Dian Fossey. Nur kelkfoje i
malsupreniris al la vilao Kimini, nur malofte al la urbo
Ruhengeri, tre malofte al la ruanda efurbo Kigali. Sed kiam i
estis en Kigali, i kelkfoje multe aniis: i tiam atis esti
bele vestita kaj havi bonajn manojn. Sed reveninte al Karisoke,
i denove distanciis de la homaro kaj vivis nur por siaj goriloj
kaj por aliaj bestoj.<P>
Sed ia persista laboro havis sukceson. iaj iutagaj observoj
pri la vivo de pluraj familioj de goriloj havigis al i tiom da
informoj, ke i povis verki interesajn studojn. Tiuj rezultoj e
ebligis al i, kiu neniam estis farinta altajn studojn, akiri
doktoran gradon. ia libro pri la ``goriloj en la nebulo'' furoris.
La de i iniciatita fondao Digit - honore al la gorilo Digit,
kruele mortigita de telasistoj - havis sukceson kaj havigis
bonajn financajn rimedojn por darigi la esplorojn. En medioj de
feministoj i estis ladata kiel ekzemplo de entreprenema virino,
en medioj de naturprotektantoj i estis la savanto de la goriloj
kaj de la ruanda naturo.<P>
Sed en Ruando mem i estis kaj restis malatata. Dum 18 jaroj i
neniam (krom en la fino de 1985) ricevis la kutiman
restadpermeson por du jaroj, sed iam nur por du a tri monatoj,
permesoj kiuj iam estis akirataj nur per penaj intervenoj de la
usona ambasado. Kelkaj el iaj agoj en la naturrezervejo estis
apena digesteblaj por la loka loantaro kaj por la pli altaj
instancoj. ia dara rifuzado de turismaj vizitoj al grupoj de
goriloj (vizitoj kiuj tamen iis granda turisma sukceso kaj ne
havis la timatajn malfavorajn efikojn) ne estis bonvenaj e la
Ruanda Servo por Turismo. iaj daraj kvereloj kun la
respondeculoj de la Nacia Parko igis in malatinda persono, e
post plibonio de la situacio, kiam la belga evoluhelpado delegis
spertulojn por la prizorgado de la rezervejo. Multaj el iaj
dungitoj ne eltenis la vivon kun i kaj anka multaj sciencistoj
foriris kun amaraj spertoj. Entute i kreis multajn malamikojn.<P>
Iom neatendite en novembro 1985 i akiris restadpermeson por du
jaroj. Nun io por i povis esti en ordo ... Sed en la nokto de
la 26a al la 27a de decembro 1985 iu a iuj envenis en ian domon
kaj mortigis in ...<P>
Kiu a kiuj? Pro kiuj motivoj? Kio okazis tie?
<H4>La konstatoj post la murdo</H4>
En la frua mateno de la 27a de decembro la hejma servisto trovis
ian kadavron kaj avertis la aliajn. Nur post kelkaj horoj iu el
ili atingis Ruhengeri por tie komuniki la okazintaon. Tuj la
usona ambasado en Kigali (180 km for) estis avertita.
Senprokraste la ambasada dungito Kathleen Austin estis sendita al
Karisoke por akiri pliajn informojn. Nur en la malfrua
posttagmezo, kiam jam ekmallumiis, i kaj du ruandaj
oficialuloj, inter kiuj kolonelo Karangwa kaj franca kuracisto,
atingis la lokon por fari la necesajn konstatojn. Vera nekropsio
ne plu estis ebla pro la nesufia lumo. La ruandanoj insistis pri
tuja enterigo, sed la usonanino rifuzis. Oni konstatis plurajn
aferojn, i.a. ke Dian tenis inter la fingroj de amba manoj
kelkajn nekrispajn harojn; oni iom senzorge elprenis tiujn harojn
por aldoni ilin al la krimdosiero. En la mallumo la homoj
malsupreniris al Ruhengeri, iom diskutante pri la afero kaj jam
esprimante opiniojn pri la ebla(j) kulpulo(j).<P>
De Ruhengeri Kathleen Austin telefone povis konfirmi al sia
ambasado la morton de Dian Fossey. De tie la novao pasis al
Usono kaj al la cetera mondo. La novao kazis abomenon en multaj
medioj de naturprotektantoj; senhezite multaj deklaris, ke Dian
estas murdita de venemaj telasistoj kaj ke i iis viktimo de
sia senhalta kampanjo por la protektado de la goriloj.
<H4>La verdikto</H4>
Dum monatoj la morto de Dian Fossey regule revenis kiel temo de
interparoloj en Ruando, efe en medioj de eksterlandanoj. Sed tio
anka estis e studentoj de la fakultato de sciencoj en la
universitato en Butare, kiel mi povis konstati post mia alveno
tien kelkajn semajnojn post ia morto. Kiam en majo 1986 mi
vizitis kun studentoj de la lasta studjaro de zoologio la centron
Karisoke por tie observi la gorilojn
<A HREF="#noto2"> <SUP>2</SUP> </A> <A NAME="renoto2"> ni plurfoje parolis pri
tio, anka kun la du tieaj usonaj sciencistoj David Watts kaj
Wayne R. McGuire. iu atendis, ke balda la tribunalo okupos sin
pri la afero, sed multaj konversacioj restis ``en la nebulo''. Mi
komprenis, ke ni prefere ne tro enu la homojn tie per tiu afero.<P>
Nur en la fino de agusto la ruanda tribunalo akuzis iun pri la
murdo: ne telasiston, ne iun el iaj multaj malamikoj, sed ian
kunlaboranton Wayne R. McGuire! McGuire ekhavis la informon per
iu de la lokaj personoj, kiam li estis observanta gorilojn en
arbaro for de la studcentro. Li tuj revenis en la centron kaj,
bone konsciante pri la neseriozeco de la ruanda justica aparato,
li tuj enpakis siajn objektojn, veturis al Kigali kaj tie eniris
la unuan aviadilon eksterlanden por de tie vojai al Usono. Kiam
endarmoj venis al Karisoke por aresti lin, li jam delonge estis
for ..., kaj neniu sciis kien.<P>
En decembro 1986 la ruanda tribunalo pritraktis la kazon, kaj, en
maleesto de la akuzito, venis per pluraj malfortaj argumentoj al
la konkludo, ke McGuire estus la murdinto; la tribunalo kondamnis
lin al mortopuno. Por la ruandaj oficialuloj la afero estis
klara: Dian Fossey estis murdita ne de iu ruandano, sed de iu el
siaj samnacianoj McGuire.<P>
Neniam la ruanda justico insistis, ke Usono transdonu la
kondamniton. Fakte i havis kialojn por ne insisti pri tio, ar
la verdikto kazis veran indignon en multaj medioj, speciale en
Usono, kaj krome estis supozeble preferinde, ke McGuire ne havu
la okazon paroli.<P>
Kiam Ruando deziris memorigi sian 25jaran sendependecon en la 1a
de julio 1987 kaj invitis reon Balduenon de Belgio (kiu estis
tre atata en Ruando pro la iama belga mandato pri Ruando)
oficiale eesti la festojn, tiu i longe atendigis sian
konsenton. Lia respondo venis nur, kiam la prezidanto de Ruando
komunikis iun amnestion rilate al la jubileo; unu el la eroj de
tiu amnestio estis, ke iuj mortopunoj (fakte estis nur unu kiu
ne estis efektivigita, tiu de McGuire) estu transigitaj al
dumvivaj enkarcerigoj. La ideo ekzistas, sed supozeble i neniam
estos konfirmita, ke la reo intervenis per tia diplomatia vojo
por savi la vivon de iu supozeble senkulpa homo.
<H4>La duboj</H4>
La anglo Nicholas Gordon dedias tutan libron al la morto de Dian
sub formo de rakontoj pri siaj travivaoj dum la esplorado de la
problemo. La libro ne finias per iu konkludo, nur per diraoj de
iu el la lastaj intervjuitoj, kaj la libro lasas ion ``en la
nebulo'' (kiel diras ia titolo). Sed la verko lasas supozi
kazon, kiu is tiam ne estis formale eldirita: Dian estis eble
murdita je ordono de bofrato de la tiama ruanda prezidanto, por
ke i ne havu la okazon komuniki al la ekstera mondo la
kontrabandadon per kiu kelkaj ruandaj gravuloj (i.a. tiu bofrato)
riigis sin kaj pri kiu i disponis pruvojn.<P>
Tiu ideo estas interesa kaj i koincidas kun multaj aferoj kiuj
evidentiis en Ruando en la pasintaj jaroj. La ideo cetere ne
venas de Gordon mem, sed i ajne jam lare ekzistis en Ruando
kaj i e estis komunikita en kelkaj gazetoj de la naskiinta
politika opozicio, i.a. en julio 1992 en la <I>Tribune du Peuple</I>
(``Tribuno de la Popolo''). Tiu opozicio tiam ja kaptis kiun ajn
okazon por akuzi la familion de prezidanto Juvenal Habyiarimana
(mortinta en aprilo 1994 en aviadilakcidento, kies kulpo anka
estas ``en la nebulo''). La vera merito de Gordon estas, ke li
kolektis multajn informojn en Ruando, uste en la periodo de
granda politika malstabileco post la invado de la ribeluloj
(1990) sed anta la granda murdado, la vera ``holokasto'' (1994).<P>
Sed la libro de Gordon, kvankam interesa, ne estas bona bazo por
serioza laboro. La verkinto estas iu amatora detektivo, kiu
intervjuis aron da homoj, ne bone scipovante la francan (kaj la
intervjuitaj ruandanoj supozeble apena a tute ne la anglan) kaj
konsultinte kvanton da dokumentoj. Kvankam li vizitis Usonon por
intervjui kelkajn homojn, li ajne tute ne klopodis trovi Wayne
McGuire, la efa persono en tiu tuta afero. Krome el lia verko
montrias iu nepardonebla naiveco rilate al aferoj en Afriko.<P>
Gordon vere ne konscias, ke pluraj intervjuitaj personoj la iu
tradicia afrika metodo rakontas kion ajn, mensoge a ne, por
komplezi al tiu, kiu pagas bieron a manon, a kiu povus eble
helpi ilin por akiri ion. Por multaj ruandanoj la diferenco inter
vero kaj malvero ne estas la sama kiel por brito, kaj mensogi
havas por ili alian signifon ol por britoj
<A HREF="#noto3"> <SUP>3</SUP></A>. <A NAME="renoto3"> Multaj el la
informoj kolektitaj de Gordon tial vere ne valoras.<P>
Ekzemple li ajne neniam pensas pri la plej supozebla (almena
por iu kiu konas la kutimojn de multaj afrikanoj) kazo pro kiu
Dian fine ricevis restadpermeson por du jaroj el la manoj de la
nova efo de la Sekureca Servo; tamen li citas ke i, kontrae al
sia kutimo, i-foje iris mem viziti lin, bele vestita kaj e
parfumita, ke tio okazis en la vespero kaj ke i iam diris, ke
por akiri ion oni devas kelkfoje marandi per kiu ajn metodo.<P>
Same li ekzemple ne komprenas, ke lia vizito al Butare, kien li
estis kondukita kontra pago en la atomobilo de iu frivola
virino por tie renkonti oficiron, al kiu li devis pagi 6000
frankojn por akiri informojn, kiuj fakte nenion valoris, estas
unu el la kutimaj manieroj per kiuj iuj afrikanoj akiras monon de
naivaj eropanoj.<P>
Tamen lia libro enhavas multajn interesajn detalojn, konstatojn
kaj ideojn, kiuj ebligas analizi la cirkonstancojn, la
suspektojn, la kazojn por kulpigi iun, k.a.
<H4>Analizo de la faktoj</H4>
Nur kelkaj cirkonstancoj de la morto de Dian Fossey estas sufie
klaraj. Iu a iuj envenis ian domon, kiam i jam estis en la
lito a preparis sin por enlitii. Pro la fakto ke i ne kutimis
losi la pordon, (i)li eble envenis tutsimple tra la pordo; estas
e malverajne ke (i)li venis tra la tegmento a tra elsegita
parto de vando (kvankam tiu parto efektive estas elsegita, eble
poste por kredigi pri iu perforta enveno). La murdo okazis en la
dormoambro, kvankam ne en la lito mem. Dian estis trafita per
pluraj hakoj de la kutima <I>panga </I>(la ``maeto'', longklinga hakilo);
sed poste oni konstatis, ke i supozeble mortis pro strangolio
per nuro. La enveninto(j) ne telis ion ajn valoran. u pro
paniko post konstato ke la viktimo mortis? A u ne estis la
intenco teli? u la sola celo estis mortigi in? Eble Dian
defendis sin forte kontra tiu(j) atakanto(j); tian ideon
subtenas la haroj inter la fingroj de amba manoj; sed ekzistas
dubo pri la maniero la kiu tiuj haroj venis tie.
<H4>La eblaj motivoj</H4>
La eblaj motivoj de la murdo povas esti tre diversaj. Unua tezo
estas, ke povas temi pri rabomurdo; sed la fakto, ke ajne nenio
estis forprenita, e ne la mono, donas malmulte da subteno al tia
ideo. Alia tezo estas, ke iu envenis por peti ion, ekz.
dokumentojn, poste kverelis kun i kaj tiom furioziis ke tiu
mortfrapis in, kaj tiam panike fuis, eble forpreninte kion tiu
deziris havi; tiam preska certe temus pri iu surloke loanta
persono (kiu ja venus nokte al Karisoke nur por tio?) kaj kiu
uzas indienan hakilon, do verajne ne iu ne-afrikano. Ofte
adita tezo estas, ke la telasistoj a aliaj kontrauloj de
Dian volis mortigi in pro veno kontra la multaj malfacilaoj,
kiujn i kazis al ili. Unuavide tia tezo estas tre akceptebla,
sed i ne koincidas kun la realo: en Ruando oni eliminas sian
malamikon per veneno a per sorado, kvankam tio bezonigas iom da
tempo. Alia, kaj iom nova tezo, estas ke influhavaj personoj
deziris la tujan morton de Dian, anta ol i komunikos ion, kio
povos kompromiti tiujn personojn, ekz. kompliceco en
kontrabandado de oro, diamantoj, drogoj a eburo el Zairio tra
la naturrezervejo, a en vendado de junaj goriloj. Tiu tezo estas
tre akceptebla, kaj la libro de Gordon alportas plurajn
argumentojn por akceptigi tion. Se la teksto sur la lastaj paoj
de la libro de Gordon, nome la deklaroj de iu Boniface, us anta
la foriro de Gordon al Eropo, enhavas veron (sed kiel dirite,
oni iam povas pridubi tion, ar tiu Boniface bezonis helpon de
Gordon por povi eskapi el Ruando, kaj li eble deziris komplezi
lin per fantaziao), la afero okazis jene: la edzino kaj la
bofrato de la prezidanto, kaj iusence la prezidanto mem, deziris
la malaperon de Dian Fossey, ne nur ar Dian forte kontrais la
estiintan ``gorilturismon'', sed plie ar i sciis tro pri la
trafiko de junaj goriloj kaj pri orkontrabandado, kaj i
eltrovis, kiu persono estas la homo malanta tiu reto de
kontrabandado, nome Protais Zigiranyirazo, enerale konata per la
nomo ``Zed'', la bofrato de la prezidanto. Je ies ordono kvar
homoj, inter kiuj du ekssoldatoj, estis komisiitaj iri murdi Dian
kiel eble plej balda.<P>
Post ilia tasko, anstata esti rekompencataj, ili estis provizore
enkarcerigitaj en Ruhengeri; poste ili estas mortigitaj en siaj
eloj, por ke ili neniam povu paroli pri la faritao. u kredebla
afero? Eble jes, ar en Ruando la krueleco de la vivo estas tia,
anka en 1985, kaj tiu krueleco abunde montriis en 1994 per la
amasaj murdoj.
<H4>La justicaj esploroj</H4>
La tagon post la murdo la endarmoj de Ruhengeri arestis la
malmultajn homojn, kiuj tiam estis en Karisoke por ke ili estu
pridemandataj. Inter ili estis anka Wayne R. McGuire (la alia
usonano, David Watts, tiam estis en Usono), sed tiu povis resti
surloke. Speciala atento iris al Emmanuel Rwelekana, la iama
hejmservisto de Dian, reveninta pro Kristnasko post forestado pro
iama akra kverelo kun Dian. Post kelkaj tagoj la dungitoj estis
liberigitaj, krom Rwelekana. La diroj al Gordon, sep jarojn
poste, iuj estis plurfoje batitaj, e torturitaj, por ke ili
konfesu ion. Kaj supozeble en tiaj cirkonstancoj pluraj sciigis
sian miron pri la reveno de Rwelekana, a malaton pri McGuire.
Nur multajn tagojn poste funkciuloj de la justico traseris la
domojn en Karisoke kaj notis ion, kio povus interesi: en la domo
de McGuire ili trovis kelkajn paojn el la dokumentaro de Dian,
kaj, je surprizo de McGuire mem, losilojn de la domo de Dian,
kaitajn sub lia tapio. En la domo de Rwelekana oni trovis
emizon kun sangomakuloj.<P>
Dum monatoj neniu, krom la kutimaj personoj, rajtis veni al
Karisoke. Kiam en majo 1986 mi intencis viziti Karisoke kun
kelkaj el miaj studentoj, mi havis lastminute multajn problemojn
kiuj nur solviis danke al la universitato kaj iom da bonvolaj
intervenoj. Ni pasigis tie tri interesajn tagojn kun D. Watts,
W.R. McGuire kaj la sviso J. Hess, plus la ruandaj gardistoj. En
tiu periodo okazis la unua naskio de gorilaj emeloj konstatita
en la naturo; unu el la du idoj tamen mortis kaj ni pristudis
ian kadavron. Kiam en julio mi revenis kun unu el la studentoj
kaj kun mia filo, mi havis la samajn problemojn: la studento kaj
mi rajtis iri tien, mia filo tamen ne.
<H4>La suspektitoj</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Je la fino de agusto 1986 oni eksciis, ke la ruanda justico
akuzis McGuire kaj ke tiu fuis el la lando. Argumentoj por la
akuzo: la losiloj trovitaj en lia domo (sed kiu ajn povas veni
meti losilojn sub ies tapion), la dokumentoj el la arkivo (sed
ili ne havis iun specialan valoron), la kelkaj blondaj haroj
trovitaj inter la fingroj de la murdito (sed estas konata truko
meti ies harojn ien por povi suspektigi lin), la akuzoj fare de
kelkaj gardistoj (li ne estis atata pro lia disciplinema
severeco), lia supozata aluzo pri Dian, liaj multaj kvereloj kun
i (efe pri la rezultoj de la esploroj), k.a.<P>
iuj tiuj argumentoj estis sufiaj por la ruanda tribunalo. La
kondamno de McGuire estis des pli facila ar li ne eestis por
defendi sin.<P>
Prave oni povas demandi u estas eble, ke persono kiu estus
murdinta sian kolegon, kaj kiu povus poste senprobleme foriri por
iom eskapi el memorado pri la eventoj, u do tia persono restus
surloke, darigus siajn esplorojn, bone kunlaborus kun la
justico, ktp. Tio estas vere nekomprenebla, krom se la koncerna
persono estus psikopato kun du personecoj kiuj ne konscias unu
pri la alia. Kaj mi ne kredas, ke McGuire estis tia. Li ja havis
iom malagrablan karakteron, li ne estis sociema, sed tio ne estas
argumento por kredi ke li estus dupersona individuo kiu iun tagon
murdas kaj la alian tagon ne konscias pri tio. La akuzo kontra
McGuire estas la mi (kaj la tiom da aliaj) komplete sensenca,
kaj i servis nur por ne devi kondamni ruandanon kaj por ke dum
la sesioj, danke al lia maleesto, ne estu dirataj tro da aferoj
kiuj povus riveli malagrablajn faktojn.<P>
<LI>Alia suspektito estis Emmanuel Rwelekana. Dum jaroj li estis
la sindedia servisto de Dian Fossey; sed iun tagon li ne plu
eltenis ian tiranecan konduton, havis kverelon kun i kaj
foriris. Post kelkaj monatoj li tamen revenis al Karisoke kaj
uste tiam la murdo okazis. Krome oni trovis en lia domo emizon
kun sangomakuloj kaj anka estis sango sur liaj botoj; sed tiu
sango venis la Rwelekana de cimoj, kiujn li estis mortpreminta.
Dum monatoj li restis en la karcero, e kiam la akuzo kontra
McGuire estis oficiala.<P>
La indikoj en la libro de Gordon, la juaparato tenis lin en la
karcero por ke li restu grava atestanto; dare iuj personoj
insistis, ke li iu preta atesti kontra McGuire, kiel faris
kelkaj el liaj kolegoj. Sed Rwelekana, kiu estis sincera, honesta
kaj obstina homo, dare rifuzis kulpigi, e malgra la promesoj,
ke li estus tuj liberigita post deklaro malfavora al McGuire.
Post tiuj multaj rifuzoj, iun tagon li estis transportita el la
malliberejo de Ruhengeri al tiu de Kigali, kie li estis konfidita
al la kruela adjutanto Hagema; de tie li revenis sub formo de
kadavro, - tio la la deklaroj de iuj personoj intervjuitaj de
Gordon. La oficiala versio estas, ke li pendigis sin en sia
karcerelo per maniko de sia emizo. Sed Gordon konkludas pro
diversaj konstatoj de spertaj personoj pri la faritaj fotoj, ke
tia sinpendigo estas malebla; krome sinmortigo estas iu ekstreme
malofta fenomeno en Ruando. Pli akceptebla estas la tezo, ke li
estis mortbatita de Hagema kaj ke la fotoj devis malkredigi tion.
Jen do plia murdo ``en la nebulo''.
</OL>
<H4>Kaema justico</H4>
La ruanda justico ajne ne vidis la neceson suspekti aliajn
personojn, e malgra la enerala opinio eksterlande ke
telasistoj estus la kulpuloj. McGuire estis la dezirata viktimo
por tato kiu preferis, ke la mond-opinio ne diru, ke ruandanoj
mortigis la faman naturprotektantinon.<P>
La demando pri la vera(j) kulpulo(j) tamen plue okupis iujn
homojn kaj i reaperis en la surlokaj diskutoj en la periodo de
kreskanta opozicio kontra la tiamaj regantoj (de 1990 is 1994).
La urnalisto Gordon prave demandas, u la morto de kolonelo
Karangwa (la persono kiu siatempe skribis la unuan raporton pri
la murdo) kaj tiu de adjutanto Hagema (la kruela pridemandanto en
la malliberejo de Kigali), amba evidentaj kazoj de venenmurdo,
anka estis inspiritaj per la motivo, ke personoj kiuj scias tro,
prefere malaperu por ke ili ne plu povu paroli. Jen do pliaj
``murdoj en la nebulo''.
<h4>Ekmankas la atestantoj</H4>
Malaperis jam pluraj, kiuj scias ion pri la cirkonstancoj de la
morto de Dian Fossey. Kaj la eventoj de 1994, kiuj kazis la
morton de eble miliono da ruandanoj plus la fuadon de unu plia
miliono al aliaj landoj, certe ne plifaciligos iun seriozan
respondon je la demando pri la vera kulpulo. Cetere Ruandon nun
zorgigas pli ia granda murdproblemaro ol ia okazintao dekjara.
<H4>Finaj konstatoj</H4>
Dek jaroj pasis post tiu fama murdo en la malgranda, tiam apena
konata Ruando. La murdo estus pasinta preska neperceptata, se la
viktimo ne estus estinta persono kiu multon signifis en medioj de
naturprotektantoj, kaj kiu pro sia morto ricevis en tiuj medioj
la martiran kronon. Krome la filmo, kiu estas farita pri ia
vivo, anka kontribuas al konservado de memoroj pri i. La
justicaparato en Ruando kredis, ke la afero de la murdo povos
esti klasifikata post la verdikto de tribunalo, kiu deklaris, ke
la murdinto ne estas ruandano. Sed la publiko ne kontentiis per
tiu pridubebla verdikto, anka ne en Ruando. Jam en 1992 la
naskiinta politika opozicio en Ruando klare sugestis la
komplicecon de la familio de la prezidanto. En tiu sama periodo
la anglo Nicholas Gordon verkis libron pri tiu afero kaj li
konjektis, ke krom la murdita Dian Fossey jam tri aliaj personoj
estis murditaj (la servisto Rwelekana, kolonelo Karangwa kaj
adjutanto Haguma) por ke ili ne plu povu paroli.
<h4>Konkludoj</H4>
Ekzistas malmultaj argumentoj por levi Dian Fossey al la altaro
de la martiroj de la naturprotektado. Supozeble i estis
mortigita pro la fakto ke i sciis tro pri la malbela rolo de iuj
gravaj personoj de la ruanda socio. En tiu senco i estis viktimo
de la intrigoj de la ruanda socia vivo. La ideo ke i estis
murdita de aluza kunlaboranto estas vere malakceptebla, kvankam
tio estis la tezo de la ruanda tribunalo. Fakte estas nur li kiu
scias la veron. Se tiu persono, Wayne R. McGuire, iam estus preta
paroli, ni scius multon plie pri la tragika vivofino de Dian
Fossey.

Rusio anta sia estonteco</H2>
<H3>de Mikael Korotkov</H3>
Rusio, malfacila lando inter Okcidento kaj Oriento, ekzistas ne nur
dum la lastaj 70 jaroj. Kiel kristana komunumo i ekzistas pli ol
mil jarojn, sed anka pli antae iaj popoloj ekzistis.
<P>
Antikvaj historiistoj, la greko Herodoto kaj la romiano Tacito,
skribis komence de la pasinta jarmilo: Slavoj estas la plej bonkoraj
homoj, ili estas popoloj pli moralaj, ol ermanoj kaj romianoj.
<P>
Anta 1000 jaroj tiu popolo akceptis la ortodoksan kristanismon, la
plej puran kristan doktrinon, kiun Rusio konservis sen revizioj is
niaj tagoj. Post tiam la evoluo de Rusio pli humane fluis. Anta
kristanismo en Rusio povis ekzisti sovaaj kutimoj, sed post
kristanismo ili malaperis.
<P>
Dum la lasta jarmilo la iama Kieva Ruslando plivastiadis is Pacifiko.
Tia estas la rusa historio, kiu distingias esence de la historio de
okcidenteropaj landoj.
<P>
Kiam ermanaj kaj latinidaj popoloj disvastiis tra Eropo, ili
malaperigis iujn aliajn popolojn. En la antikva Eropo ekzistis
multege da popoloj. Ni nomu nur kelkajn el ili: etruskoj, liguroj,
galoj, akvitanoj, belgoj, iberoj. Tiuj i popoloj postlasis signojn
en la historio, sed ankora pli multaj malaperis senspure. Mirakle
restis sude en Eropo vaskoj, kaj norde --- irlandanoj. Kie estas
iuj aliaj popoloj? Ili delonge malaperis kiel sumeranoj a
egiptoj. Preska iuj okcidenteropaj landoj iis unulingvaj.
<P>
Dum mil jaroj Rusio etendiis orienten. Sur iaj teritorioj vivis
aliaj popoloj. Jes, vivis kaj vivas is nun. u oni povas nomi
almena unu landon en Eropo, kie vivus almena 10 indienaj
popoloj? Tiuj landoj ne ekzistas. Sed en Ruslando is nun vivas
130 popoloj. Neniu el ili malaperis dum jarmilo.
<P>
Neniu caro, neniu diktaturo povis malaperigi e unu el la
ruslandaj popoloj. Post la jaro 1917 la bolevika diktaturo strebis
iom post iom --- por pli baldaa venko de komunismo --- rusigi iujn
naciojn, sed ne sukcesis. La historia tendenco de la rusa popolo
konserviis. Rusoj ne neniigis aliajn kulturojn, sed male.
Ekzemple: multaj rusaj pentristoj post 1917 veturis al mezaziaj
respublikoj, por ke ekestu la uzbeka, taika, kirgiza pentroartoj.
Antae tiuj pentroartoj ne ekzistis.
<P>
Nature, ne iuj el la 130 ruslandaj popoloj povis egale evoluigi siajn
naciajn kulturojn. Tio estas nesimpla problemo. Dum nia jarcento la
mondo havas, verajne, nur unu ekzemplon de renaskio de lingvo:
la hebrea. La lingvo estis morta kiel latino a sanskrito dum
tri jarmiloj. Necesis la deziro de la nacia aganto Ben-Jehuda por
ke i renaskiu.
<P>
La ruslandaj popoloj --- nenecoj, ukoj, nanajoj kaj aliaj --- ne
havis siajn ben-jehudojn. Sed malgra tio, en la lingvoj de tiuj
popoloj, parolas homoj, kaj aperas libroj kaj gazetoj. (Eble nur
lastatempe, dum la sovaa merkato, iuj libroj a gazetoj malaperis.
Sed anka tio estos provizora; neniu sentalenta gvidanto povos
returni la historiajn tendencojn.)
<P>
Por la ruslandaj popoloj la disfalo de Sovet-Unio ne estis dezirata:
i estis necesa al fipolitikuloj. En la iama Sovet-Unio siatempe
aperis multe da prezidentoj, kiuj certe volis esti estroj de
memstaraj tatoj. Pro unu el tiuj prezidentoj jam preska du
jarojn daras milito en eenio. Kaj kiom da tempo militis
kartveloj kaj abazoj pro alia uzurpanta prezidento?
<P>
Tiuj naciistoj forgesis, ke nur pro la helpo de Rusio ili konserviis.
Jen kelkaj ekzemploj. La okcident-armena lingvo ne havas kondiojn
por sia evoluo, kaj iom post iom malaperas. Sed la orient-armena,
danke al la eniro de Orienta Armenio en Rusion, iis lingvo de la
armena nacio kaj nun lingvo de l' armena tato.
<P>
La kirgiza lingvo is 1924 ne havis skribon, kaj nun i estas
tata lingvo.
<P>
Multaj kakazaj popoloj post la jaro 1917 parte forveturis en
apudajn landojn. Nun ili tie havas nek lernejojn, nek siajn gazetojn.
Ili malaperis kiel popoloj. En Rusio, popoloj kun nur e mil
parolantoj havas proprajn literaturon kaj gazetojn.
<P>
Sed Rusio estas avangarda lando ne nur pro tio. Dum la lasta jardeko
la ``perestrojko'' t.e. renovigado, establo de nova pensado kaj
rifuzo de la ``malvarma milito'' okazis nur en Rusio, ne en la Okcidento.
Anka nun Nord-Atlantika Traktat-Organizao (NATO) strebas al
Oriento por alporti tien nukleajn armilojn.
<P>
Mi ne volas ladegi la nunajn gvidantojn de Rusio, kvaza ili per siaj
agoj direktus Rusion al la estonteco. Male, iuj iliaj provoj fari ion
pozitivan iufoje fiaskas. Ne ili, sed la estinteco de Rusio preparis
in al granda estonteco, kaj fine de la 20a jarcento Rusio estos preta
pli ol aliaj landoj plenumi la dian intencon.
<P>
La efa premiso por tio estas ia neelerpebla fonto de spirita
evoluo --- iaj 130 naciaj kulturoj. La nuntempa homaro ankora ne
lernis profiti el la diversformeco de nacioj. Bedarinde nun i
strebas male al unuformeco; notu ekzemple, kiel disvastias tra la
mondo la eropa vestaa modo, la usona pragmatismo kaj la angla
lingvo.
<P>
Sed post iom da tempo la homaro komprenos, ke unuformeco estas enuo
kaj embaraso por evoluo. Kaj tiam Rusio, parinta trezorojn de 130
kulturoj, de iuj mondaj religioj, kiuj pace kunvivas inter iliaj
popoloj, la lando de talentaj, kleraj kaj toleremaj homoj, montros al
la mondo novan vivmanieron, alian ol la okcidenta pragmatismo, kiu
detruas la dian esencon en homo.

<H3>El mia vidpunkto</H3>
<H2>Kompatindaj germanoj?</H2>
En la atuno de l' pasinta jaro amasaj strikoj kaj protestoj en Francio
kontra registaraj planoj, redukti socialajn servojn kaj enspezojn de
laboristoj, dum semajnoj okupis la frapliniojn de amaskomunikiloj en Eropa
Unio (EU). Ja la registaro argumentis, ke iliaj parplanoj ebligu alion de
Francio al la fifama eropa valuta unuio. Tiam oni sciis, ke el iuj
EU-tatoj nur Luksemburgo kaj Germanio plenumas iujn kriteriojn por
enkonduko de komuna valuto.
<P>
Sed, ho ve! Komence de tiu i jaro okis la union alia alarmkrio: la
germana financministro Theo Waigel [Teo Vajgel] devis konfesi, ke la plej
freaj statistikoj e Germanio en 1995 ne konformis al iuj kriterioj, pro
tro multaj senlaboruloj, tro multaj tatuldoj kaj tro malmulta ekonomia
kresko. Kaj pro pesimismaj prognozoj pri tiu i jaro, en kiu - tiel timas
la ministro - Germanio denove ne sukcesos kontentigi la katalogon de l'
EU-kriterioj! Sed sen Francio kaj Germanio valuta unuio nek havas sencon
nek eblas.
<H4>Modelo en krizo</H4>
Ne tiom amase kiom en Francio, tamen anka en Germanio surstrataj protestoj
kaj manifestacioj kritikis entreprenojn kaj registaron, kiu rapidis starigi
``aliancon por laboro'', en kiu kunagu regantoj, kompanioj kaj sindikatoj por
krei novajn laborlokojn kaj antaenigi la ekonomion. Alarmis kreskinta
nombro de bankrotoj, ne nur de etaj kaj mezaj entreprenoj, sed e de
grandaj tradiciaj firmaoj. La mondfama kompanio kaj holdingo Daimler devis
konfesi deficiton de miliardoj da markoj.
<P>
Kio okazis pri la ``modela knabo'', ke (ajne) subite e Germanio ne plu
estas paradizo de libera merkato? Britoj, pli malpli malkae, esprimis sian
malican ojon pri tiu krizo, gazetoj mokis pri la ancelianta giganto.
Seriozaj britaj gazetoj tamen iom bremsis la malicon, komparante la
situaciojn en amba landoj. Tiel britaj legantoj eble por la unua fojo
legis pri ``socialplanoj'' (t.e. kompensaj pagoj de entrepeno por maldungotoj
en kazo de bankroto), ``libertempomono'' (t.e. 14a salajro, pagata en
decembro). Germanaj kolegoj meze enspezas salajron duoblan kompare al
britaj kolegoj, kiuj krome havas du semajnojn malpli da libertempo jare. E
se germana laboristo perdas sian postenon, li enspezas per la asekuro pli
multan monon ol brita kolego salajron! Jen do unu flanko de la realo.
<H4>Solidar-imposto</H4>
Tamen, la alia flanko de l' medalo estas, ke efektive anka germanoj
enerale devas nun redukti sian kutiman enspezonivelon. Kompreneble la
monda ekonomia krizo ne lasas netuita Germanion, sed aldonias problemo
nekonata en aliaj EU-landoj: Germanio devis de unu tago al alia havigi
monon por rekonstrui kompletan taton, pri kies preska perfekta bankroteco
antae neniu sciis. Do ekde la unuio de amba Germanioj okcidentaj
laboristoj devas pagi kroman ``solidarimposton''; aktuale i formanas
ekzemple el la salajro de l' atoro preska 130 markojn monate (en unu jaro
per tiu i mono mi povus pagi 24 kotizojn de MONATO). Sed montriis, ke e
tiu i imposto ne sufias por solvi la problemojn en la orienta parto de la
lando, do la registaro enkondukis kaj enkondukas pli kaj pli da
kvazaimpostoj a reduktas kutimajn socialajn pagojn.
<P>
Redukti, tamen, oni ja povas nur se la nivelo estas relative alta. La
germana tato dum la pasintaj jardekoj - en dare prospera fazo -
konsiderinde altigis siajn socialajn servojn, tiel ke nun iu tria marko
enspezita per la fisko refluas en socialan sektoron por helpi civitanojn.
Kaj spite al iuj problemoj, anka dum la pasintaj kvin jaroj post la
unuio la germana ekonomio kostante kreskis.
<P>
Sed kiel klarigi, ke tamen en Germanio estas tiom multaj senlaboruloj?
Parte tio uldias al la fakto, ke en orienta Germanio post la unuio tre
multaj bankrotaj (ofte tataj) entreprenoj devis fermi la butikon. En
okcidento - krom bankrotoj pro misdirektorado en kriza ekonomio - la nombro
de laborlokoj ne tiom kreskis, ar eble pli ol en aliaj industrilandoj,
germanaj entreprenoj raciigadis siajn strukturojn. Jen komparo: por
produkti varojn a servojn en valoro de unu miliono da markoj en la jaro
1965 oni bezonis meze 140 personojn en agrikulturo, hodia 23 personojn; en
komerco kaj trafiko estis tiam 29 kaj nun 15 personoj; en varproduktado
1965 necesigis 22 personojn kompare al nur 12 en la jaro 1995. Do
disponeblaj laborlokoj por nuna juna generacio ne plu estas tiom multaj.
<H4>Gigantaj profitoj</H4>
Kompreneble, en la kadro de tiu i artikolo ni povas nur aludi kelkajn
aferojn de ege kompleksa problemaro. Se kompanioj hodia lamentas pri
deficitoj, kial ili ne anka diras, ke dum jardekoj ili enkasigis gigantajn
profitojn? Bone mastrumante, ili do devus nun facile elteni malprosperan
fazon. Sed ajnas, ke al multaj el ili krome mankas fantazio; ili preferas
simple transigi kompletajn fabrikojn al landoj kun malpli altaj salajroj
(ekzemple Britio). La konduto de germanaj kapitalistaj entreprenoj tamen
postulus apartan artikolon.
<P>
Sed ni ja povas kompreni, ke malice ojas alilandanoj pri tio, ke la
malagrabla sorto de redukto de vivnivelo nun trafis anka orgojlajn
germanojn. Aliflanke, multaj gekolegoj en aliaj landoj tute ne bedaru sed
prefere enviu kompatindajn riajn germanojn. Kiel skribis brita gazeto:
tiajn zorgojn kiel germanoj anka ni kelkfoje atus havi!

<H2><I>Mizerigaj sankcioj</I></H2>
Unu el la plej atataj rimedoj de politikistoj por puni
neatatajn reimojn estas sankcioj. Laste oni postulis
tiajn ekzemple kontra Nierio pro ekzekuto (ja murdo)
de poeto kaj aliaj homoj de l' ogoni-popolo, kiu
rezistas kontra naturdetruado de sia hejmregiono per
naftoproduktado. Politikistoj asertas, ke per ekonomia
embargo, precipe je nafteksporto, oni povus atingi
demokration de l' militista nieria diktaturo.
<H4>Iluzioj kaj spertoj</H4>
Kia iluzio! iuj spertoj pri tiaj sankcioj instruas, ke
neniel tiuj i devigas reimon al ano de sia politiko,
sed ke ili maksimume suferigas la homojn de lando sub
embargo. Kia politika cinikeco estas, puni jam
subpremitan popolon per plia sufero - is mortigo!<P>
Draste tion demonstras la ekzemplo de Irako. Memoru, ke
okaze de l' golfmilito en 1991 UN decidis sankciojn
kontra ties reimo, por tiel puni diktatoron Sadam
Husejn; precipe Usono esperis, ke pro kompleta embargo
je lia nafteksporto la brutala diktatoro devos abdiki
kaj demokratio venkos en Irako. Sed kvin jarojn poste
la diktatoro sidas sur sia trono pli komforte kaj
sekure ol iam ajn, e erojn de demokratio oni ne vidas
tie. Sed la popolo iraka suferas neimageble terure.<P>
Tion asertas ne la iraka registaro, sed serioza kaj
fidinda NAO (Nutraa kaj Agrokultura Organizao de UN).
La indikoj de NAO la situacio ``ie en la lando ias
pli kaj pli katastrofa'', kaj minacas ``ruinio de
agrokulturo kaj nutraoprovizado''. Faruno kostas nun
11000-oble pli (!) kompare al 1990, okoble pli da beboj
mortas ol tiam. Familioj praktike ne plu enspezas, en
kamparo ili detruas la proprajn domojn por vendi
konstrumaterialon. Katastrofon de malsatmorto la reimo
is nun povis eviti sole per severa porciigado de
nutraoj, sed tio certigas nur 34 elcentojn de uloj
necesaj por transvivi. 29 elcentoj de infanoj en
Bagdado estas subnutrataj. Infektaj malsanoj, kiaj tifo
kaj hepatito, oftias.
<H4>is paperismo</H4>
NAO diras, ke minimume 2,7 miliardoj da usonaj dolaroj
necesus por financi plej urajn importojn de nutrao,
kaj i apelacias al UN kaj Bagdado fine interkonsenti
pri eksportado de iraka nafto. Nur per devizoj gajnitaj
el naftovendado Irako povus aeti nutraon, avertas
NAO, ar oni ne povas atendi, ke iu lando donacu monon
por helpi al la diktatura reimo. Cetere, ke mankus
armiloj en Irako, pri tio oni nek legis nek adis
ion ...<P>
Evidente, neniu racie pensanta homo povas atendi, ke
sankcioj kondukos Irakon en la paradizon de demokratio,
sed ni scias, ke ili kondukis senkulpajn homojn en
inferon de malsato, malsano kaj mizerego, en veran
paperismon. u tion intencis atingi la tiom honestaj
demokratoj sub gvido de Usono, kiu rigardas la irakan
diktatoron satano?<P>
Komisiito de Monda Nutra Programo de UN post vizito en
Irako uzis drastajn vortojn: ``Oni ne povas puni
tutan generacion!'' En Irako ``oni ostaigis la tutan
loantaron pro io, kion i ne povas ani'', li akuzis
kaj informis: El la kvar milionoj da homoj, kiuj ne
havas sufie por mani, estas 2,4 milionoj da infanoj
malpli ol kvinjaraj kaj 600&#160;000 gravedulinoj kaj
mamnutrantaj patrinoj.
<H4>Ofendo de revoluciuloj</H4>
Sed u en aliaj okazoj sankcioj ne tamen utilis al
homoj, ar trafitaj reimoj devis cedi? Politikistoj,
kiuj defendas tiun i politikan rimedon, ekzemple
atentigas pri Sudafriko, kiu post jardekoj da ekonomia
embargo forigis rasapartigon, enkondukis egalrajtecon
kaj demokration por iuj. Estus ofendo kontra la
sudafrikaj popoloj, kiuj el si mem elbatalis liberecon,
se iu volus aserti, ke tion kazis la sankcioj. Similan
miton oni aktuale konstruas rilate Jugoslavion, kiun UN
punis per embargo je armiloj; anka Serbion oni volis
devigi al repacio per ekonomia embargo. Tamen ne
sankcioj haltigis la militon; kaj kroataj kaj bosniaj
trupoj ne havis problemojn, havigi al si armilojn, por
tute ne paroli pri Serbio. La milito esis, kiam
Beogrado devis ekkoni, ke i ne povus gajni pli multe -
uste ar la aliaj konfliktpartioj disponas pri sufie
da bataliloj, spite al embargo ...<P>
Sed anka en Serbio suferis la ordinaraj homoj, ne la
reimo, pro ekonomia embargo. Mito estus anka, aserti
ke oni dankas la disfalon de l' sovetia imperio al
tiamaj okcidentaj sankcioj kontra la komunisma bloko
dum periodo de l' malvarma milito. Vere estas, ke la
socialisma ekonomia sistemo ruiniis en si mem, simple
ar i ne estis dare vivkapabla. La anojn elbatalis
klarvidaj homoj kiel ekzemple Gorbaov kaj la popoloj
per parte sangaj, parte mildaj (en Pollando, Hungario
kaj eoslovakio) revolucioj. Inter okcidentaj sankcioj
estis ekzemple malpermeso de eksportado de altkvalitaj
elektronikaj aparatoj al Sovetio. Sed u vi ankora
memoras la tutmondajn mokojn, kiam preska samtempe kun
prezento de fama brita/franca superjeto Konkordo en
Moskvo aperis isdetala kopio de tiu ``unika'' aviadilo?<P>
Evidente, sankcioj estas unu el la plej maltagaj
rimedoj de internacia politiko, spite al iuj kontraaj
asertoj kaj mitoj. Ili ofendas homojn, ar oni
suferigas a e mizerigas ilin dume kaj - se tamen
okazis anoj - poste ignoras oferojn kaj meritojn de
revoluciuloj.<P>

<H3>HISTORIA HOBIO</H3>
<H2><I>La arto mumiigi katojn</I></H2>
Ekzistas du specoj de hobiistoj, tiuj, kiuj amasigas kaj tiuj,
kiuj produktas. La unua grupo konsistas el homoj, kies celo estas
akiri kolektaojn de diversspecaj objektoj, inter kiuj tradicie
trovias potmarkoj, bildkartoj kaj moneroj. Kontraste al la
okupio de tiuj pasivuloj estas la aktiva agado de kreantoj kaj
konstruantoj. ar ili posedas inventemon, artistan talenton kaj
abundon da originalaj ideoj, ili ne simple kolektadas kuriozaojn
a valoraojn, sed strebas al realigo de novaoj. Inter ili estas
amatoraj pentristoj, muzikistoj, verkistoj, scienculoj kaj
alispecaj seriozaj pensuloj. Esenca karakterizo de iliaj
atokupoj estas la bezono kunordigi la funkciojn de la menso kaj
manoj. Al tiuj, kiuj emas uzi sian liberan tempon per tre
interesa kaj unika hobio, mi proponas lernadon de praktika arto
postulanta historiajn, sciencajn kaj estetikajn sciojn por
sukcesa plenumado de projektoj. Temas pri la procedo de mumiigo
a enbalzamigo la la teknikoj disvolvitaj en la antikva Egiptujo.
<H4>La kialoj de mumiigo</H4>
ar la egiptoj kredis senkondie pri la fizika resurekto de
mortintoj, iliaj religiaj principoj postulis, ke la korpo estu
gardata plej multe kiel eble en la stato, kiun i havis dum la
vivo, por ke i loigu la revenontan animon, se i deziras
ankorafoje eniri la mondon de la vivantoj. La loantoj en la
lando de Nilo bone konsciis pri la sorto de kadavro, se
malkomponio de la eksteraj, karnaj partoj ne estas haltigita. Du
procedoj servis por atingi la celon de konservado. La unua estis
spontana a natura mumiigo, kiu rezultas el elmetado de kadavroj
al la sekiga efiko de la suno kaj aero, ekzemple en la varmega
kaj seka sablo de la egipta dezerto. Tamen, tiu metodo estis tro
malrapida kaj anka necerta. Pro tio, mumiio rezultanta el
natura sekigado estis anstataigita per enbalzamigo, procedo por
intence konservi kadavrojn per aplikado de specialaj fizikaj kaj
kemiaj metodoj. Tio estas la vera signifo de mumiigo.
<H4>Komenci lerni la teknikojn</H4>
ar enbalzamigo de tuta homa korpo estas grandskala entrepreno,
estas konsilinde dedii sin unue al traktado de relative
malgrandaj bestoj. Plej konvenas la kato, ar en la lando de la
faraonoj uste tiu besto estis tre ofte enbalzamigata. Tiutempe
en iu hejmo estis kato, kiun oni tre bone prizorgis. Kiam la
familia kato mortis, la domanoj surmetis funebrajn vestaojn kaj
kantis malgajajn kantojn.<P>
Poste ili enbalzamigis la katon, por ke ties animo havu eblon
reveni kaj eniri en la mumion. Tiu i estis metita en malgrandan
erkon faritan el ligno, bronzo a kalktono kaj sepultita en
speciala kattombejo, por ke la besteto uu eternan ripozon. Oni
zorgis pri la transtomba vivo de la kato, provizante la tombon
per musmumioj.<P>
En 1890 arkeologoj, prifosante en la irkaao de la urbo
Bubastis, la centro de adorado al la katdiino Bastet, malkovris
plurajn centmilojn da katmumioj. Kvankam estas tre malmultaj
historiaj informoj pri mumiigo de sakralaj bestoj, ajnas, ke
katoj estis amase gardataj en kaptiteco fare de pastroj por la
celo de mumiigo kaj vendo al la loantaro kiel votaj oferaoj.<P>
Nun pensu pri katoj loantaj en domoj hodia. Kio estos ilia
sorto post la morto? u oni tutsimple enterigos ilin en truo
fosita en angulo de la ardeno? u tiuj atataj dombestoj ne
meritas pli dignan funebran traktadon, same kiel iliaj prauloj en
la antikva Egiptujo?
<H4>Esperantistaj katamantoj</H4>
En la sekcio pri fakorganizaoj de la Jarlibro de UEA estas
informo pri Rondo Kato, kiu membrigas esperantistojn kiuj havas
simpatiajn rilatojn kun katoj. uste tiuj homoj certe havos
intereson pri la nova hobio, ebliganta konservadon de la restaoj
de mortinta besto por eble gardi in ankora en la hejmo. La
procedo de mumiigado de katoj prezentas novan manieron fari pli
allogaj la kunvenojn de la katamikoj, kutime aranitajn okaze de
Universalaj Kongresoj. ar ne estas praktike kunporti vivantajn
katojn por montrado, la membroj de Rondo Kato is nun devas
kontentii pri uzo de bildmaterialo. Male, katmumio estas tre
facile transportebla, kaj kolektao da ili konsistigos tre
okulfrapan ekspozicion. Cetere, tiuj ``art-objektoj'' post la fino
de la ekspozicio povos esti facile interanitaj a venditaj al
membroj de la Rondo a al la publiko por kontribui al la enspezoj
de la organizao.
<H4>Modernaj sciencaj eksperimentoj</H4>
Scienculoj jam komencis eksperimenti pri la procedo de mumiigo
por kontroli la verecon de la priskriboj de antikvaj atoroj,
precipe Herodoto kaj Diodoro Sikulo. Kvankam egiptologoj
komprenas la esencon de la metodo de egipta enbalzamigo, kelkaj
detaloj ne estas bone konataj. Kun la celo solvi tiajn
problemojn, okazis en la 1930-aj jaroj eksperimenta mumiigo de
anasoj en la Muzeo de Kairo konforme al scioj haveblaj en la
fontdokumentoj, kaj tiuj mumioj ankora estas en bona stato. Se
anka kreivaj hobiistoj partoprenos en simila agado, ili certe
akiros pli profundan historian perspektivon, kiel aktualaj
praktikantoj de unu el la gravaj teknikaj malkovroj de la
antikvuloj, kaj tiu okupio ligos ilin pli intime al la vivo kaj
kulturo de Egiptujo.
<H4>La procedo de enbalzamigo</H4>
Ekde la komenco estas necese averti sentimentalajn bestamantojn,
ke ili ne havu zorgon pri vivisekcio. La kreado de mumioj estas
metio, kiu ne estas praktikata sur vivantaj organismoj, nek homaj
nek bestaj. Kiam kato trafas la enbalzamigan tabulon, i ja
devas esti senviva.

Estas nepre necese forigi la internajn organojn el la katkorpo,
ar se ili restas, la procezo de malkomponio disvolvias pli
rapide. Unue, do, firme fiksu la katkadavron sur kliniantan
lignan tabulon; tio faciligos elfluon de la internaj fluidaoj
dum sekcado. Faru entranojn en la kapo kaj abdomeno kaj eltiru
la cerbon kaj iujn viscerojn.
<P>
<LI>Lavado de la korpaj kavoj<P>
La sekvaj paoj havas kiel celojn rapidigon de sekio de la korpo
kaj samtempan malhelpon de misformio. La egiptaj enbalzamigistoj
lavis la torakan kaj abdomenan kavojn per spicoj kaj palmvino;
nuntempe iu ajn vino povas esti uzata. Kiam vi jam purigis la
kavojn, plenigu ilin per provizoraj remburaoj, ekzemple sablo,
pajlo, rezino, sekigitaj vegetalaj fibroj kaj aliaj substancoj
emane haveblaj.
<P>
<LI>Sekigado<P>
La estonta mumio nun estas preta por sekigado, kiu okupos 40 el
la 70 tagoj tradicie bezonataj por la tuta enbalzamiga procedo de
homa korpo. Tamen, en la kazo de malgranda katkadavro, estos
bezonata proporcie malpli longa tempo. La sekiga procedo
konsistas el mergado de la katkadavro en sekan natronon
(Na2CO3.10H20 - hidrata natria karbonato). En Egiptujo i troviis
en la naturo kiel miksao plejparte el natria karbonato kaj
natria bikarbonato. Estas uzeblaj anka aliaj kemiaoj kun
higroskopa propreco. Manke de tiaj substancoj, tagas anka
enterigo de la kadavreto en varmegan, sekan sablon. Dum la kato
kuadas sub la tavolo da natrono a sablo, la ledeca hato rapide
gluias al la ostoj.
<P>
<LI>Nova remburado<P>
Post traktado per natrono a seka sablo, la kadavro estas tiel
bone senakvigita, ke neniu plua sekigado estas bezonata. Kiam la
korpo estas liberigita de natrono, elprenu la provizorajn
remburaojn kaj zorge lavu la korpon per akvo kaj vino. Metu
rezinon a linan tolaon trempitan en rezino en la kranian kavon
kaj plenigu la abdomenon per segpolvo, rezino, eventuale cepoj,
zorge envolvitaj en malgrandaj linaaj saketoj. Poste kunkudru
la abdomenon. Je tiu i punkto la egiptoj frotis la korpon per
miksao el cedro-oleo, kumino, vakso, natrono, gumo, eble anka
lakto kaj vino, kaj surutis in kun spicoj. Por fortikigi la
haton kaj malhelpi, ke malsekeco eniru la porojn, ili miris
dikan tavolon da rezino sur la tutan korpon.
<P>
<LI>Modlado<P>
Por reliefigi la konturojn de la trunko kaj vizao de la kato,
estas necese enmeti plenigajn substancojn sub la hatsurfacon.
Remburu la vangojn per linaoj trempitaj en rezinaj substancoj a
apliku rezinon en la formo de pasto. Tiel vi povas tre precize
modli la membrojn kaj eksterajn trajtojn. En kelkaj kazoj vi
povas plenigi la kavojn sur la hato per koto, sablo, pajlohakao
a aliaj materialoj por anstatai rumpintajn muskolojn. La
egiptoj enmetis miksaon el butero kaj natrono, envolvitan en
linao, en la buon kaj vangojn, tamponis la nazon, metis
malgrandajn remburaojn el linao en la okultruojn kaj fermis la
palpebrojn.<P>
Por ke la mumio havu kompaktan cilindran formon, plene etendu la
kolon kaj turnu la kapon, por ke i formu ortangulon kun la kolo.
Tiru la antaajn krurojn sur la fronton de la korpo, faldu la
malantaajn krurojn kontra la pelvon kaj suprenvolvu la voston
inter la krurojn.
<P>
<LI>Vindado<P>
La mumio nun estas preta por vindado. Vi povas uzi senkolorajn
linajn tolaojn a geometrie arani ilin en la formo de helaj kaj
malhelaj rubandoj. Fine, donu al via katmumio plaan eksteran
aspekton per pentrado de katvizao sur la vindoj kovrantaj la
kapon.

<H3>RETPOTO</H3>
<H2><I>FIDOnet en Rusio</I></H2>
Inter la multaj ebloj eniri retlandon el Rusio la plej ekzota
estas FIDOnet. Tiu tutmonda senpaga reto, vivtenata per la
entuziasmo de malprofitemaj partoprenantoj, gajnis en Rusio kaj
precipe en Moskvo grandiozan popularecon. Nur en Moskvo ekzistas
irka 400 retnodoj, kaj al iu apartenas de 20 is 100
``punktoj'' (simplaj uzantoj, kiuj ricevas sian poton kaj aliajn
informojn per la nodoj).<P>
Ajna FIDOano en Moskvo povas aboni ne malpli ol 3000 ``eojn''
(diskutgrupoj a forumoj, en kiuj la partoprenanto ricevas la
mesaojn de iuj aliaj, abonantaj la forumon). La eoj havas plej
diversajn temojn - de profesiaj, komputistaj, bankistaj k.s. is
babilgrupoj de samdistriktaj loantoj. Ekzistas internaciaj
``eoj'', tutsovetiaj (por la teritorio de la eksa SU), rusiaj kaj
lokaj.<P>
Tiu plurmilkapa amaso de rusaj FIDOanoj havas proprajn
tradiciojn kaj lingvaon. La tradicioj forte bazias sur komuna
biertrinkado (ar 95 % de la partoprenantoj estas viroj). La
lingvao estas iu por ordinara homo tute nekomprenebla miksao de
komputilaj terminoj kaj rusigitaj anglaj vortoj. Multaj el la
plej ofte uzataj vortoj apartenas nur al tiu medio kaj devenas de
la rusia FIDO-medio mem. Ekzemple, oni skribas: ``Rulez'',
``rulez-a'' por diri, ke io estas tre bona, ``suxxx'', pri
malbona, maltaga. Amba vortoj devenas de la nomoj de iuj eoj,
iam ekzistintaj en la rusia FIDO. ``Ru.lez'' - tiel nomiis
forumo kreita de iu ercemulo, kaj i devis temi pri problemoj en
la vivo de rusiaj gejinoj (samseksamulinoj, lesbaninoj). ar
preska neniu FIDOano fiziologie kapablus esti gejino, do anka
pri neniuj ajn problemoj oni povis legi en la eo. Rezulte, la
konsternita publiko sinonimigis la nomon de la eo kun io beata
kaj senproblema. Similan amuzan devenon havas anka la vorto
``suxxx'' (el ``su.xxx'') kaj kelkaj aliaj.<P>
Same kiel la tuta internacia FIDO, ties rusia parto estas
direktata demokratie de la partoprenantoj mem. Ekzistas certa
principaro, regularoj kaj libere elektataj responsuloj, kiuj
zorgas, ke la principoj estu respektataj. En iu eo la
partoprenantoj mem elektas la ``moderatoron'' (moderiganton),
atoritatulon kiu observas, ke la diskutoj estu konformaj al la
temo de la forumo, ke ne okazu vort-militoj k.s. Se iu obstine
malobservas la regulojn, la moderatoro rajtas puni tiun personon
per averto, kiu aspektas kiel ``+'' en la listo de FIDOanoj. Post
ricevo de certa kvanto da plusoj la persono ne plu povas atingi
la forumon a e ajnan FIDO-nodon.<P>
Kaj fine: kial FIDO nomias FIDO? Onidire tiel estis nomata la
atata hundo de la iniciatinto de la reto.<BR>

<i>Agrabla ekzercilo</I></H2>
``Travel Talk - Ni vojau!'' estas dulingva vortaro/frazaro por
vojaoj en formo de komputila kompakta disko eldonita de
<I>Libra Multimedia Ltd.</I> en Britio. i haveblas por
pluraj lingvoparoj, inter ili anka por la paro angla-Esperanto
apud, samdiske, la paro angla-nederlanda. La disko estas uzebla
per vindozaj <a href="#noto1">(noto 1)</A> <a NAME="reen1">
kaj <I>Apple Macintosh</I>-komputiloj. La
sekvanta priskribo bazias sur la vindoza versio.<P>
Rekomendindas havi <I>Soundblaster-</I>kongruan sonkarton
por ne nur vide sed anka ade ui la programon. Utilas anka
mikrofono, ar la programo permesas registri oniajn proprajn
prononcekzercojn por kompari ilin kun la modela prononco.<P>
Anta uzo necesas instali la programon sur la efdiskon, de kie
oni in funkciigas. Sed instalias nur la programo mem, dum la
lingvomaterialo restas sur la kompakta disko, kiu do estu
en la diskstacio dum programuzo. La instalado estas tre simpla
pere de la aldonita instal-programeto, sed krome necesas, per la
kutimaj vindozaj rimedoj, aparte instali la kunliveratan tiparon
kun la apelitaj literoj de Esperanto. Post sukcesa instalado
oni trovos la vindozan programgrupon <I>Libra Multimedia</I> kun
kvar programoj (por po du direktoj en la du lingvoparoj).<P>
La uzado estas facila danke al bone konceptita programfasado, kaj
anka danke al la enkonstruita enkonduko, kiun oni labezone
aktivigas per musklako: vira voo en la respektiva fontlingvo
(do anka en Esperanto) detale klarigas la uzadon, kaj samtempe la
necesaj manipuloj estas bilde demonstrataj sur la ekrano. Eble
estas iom bedarinde, ke iujn funkciojn eblas manipuli nur per
la muso, ne per la klavaro.<P>
La esperantajn apelitajn literojn liveras la tiparo ``Publika''
kreita de Franko Luin. i estas aldonita en trutajpa kaj
postskripta formoj <a href="#noto2">(noto 2)</A> <A NAME="reen2">
kaj tute aparte, do i estas uzebla
anka en aliaj programoj. Posedantojn de apelilo enos la
fakto, ke i kongruas nek kun la apelilaj tiparoj, nek kun la
normo Latina-3: la literoj de Esperanto okupas tie aliajn
kodlokojn.<P>
La lingva materialo estas prezentata en tri sekcioj:
``Vortprovizo'', ``Temoj'' kaj ``Dialogoj''. Tiuj sekcioj dividias
la temaroj tipe vojaaj: hotelo, restoracioj, dokumentaro,
vetero, numeraloj, ktp. Kvankam la sekcio ``Vortprovizo'' donas nur
unuopajn terminojn, la sekcio ``Temoj'' prezentas frazojn kaj
frazerojn, kiuj aplikas efe la terminojn el la vortproviza
sekcio. En la ``Dialogoj'' tiu materialo estas prezentata en po du
mallongaj konversacioj por iu temo.<P>
Tiel la uzanto trovas sume proksimume 500 lingverojn, en kiuj
tamen multo ripetias. Kompare kun la kutimaj lingvaj
porvojaaj gvidlibretoj tio estas relative modesta. Aliflanke,
la programo donas multe pli bonajn kaj agrablajn rimedojn por
lerni kaj ekzerci ol iu ajn libro. io estas plene interaga. Per
simpla musklako oni elektas vorton, frazon a dialog(er)on,
vidigas ian tradukon, adigas ian prononcon, a registras
kaj readigas sian propran prononcekzercon. Aparta
kontrolfunkcio montras la lernitajn erojn en hazarda sinsekvo,
kaj la uzanto povas kolekti poentojn klakante al la ustaj
alilingvaj ekvivalentoj. Bedarinde, mankas serofunkcio la
alfabeta indekso.<P>
La esperantajn tradukojn faris Paul Gubbins. La
lingvao estas lerta kaj sperta. La esperantaj tekstoj estas
parolataj de diverslandaj esperantistoj kun agrabla kaj vere
modela prononco. Sed la tradukinto anka evidentigas sian
preferon al malformale elipsa esprimstilo: ``u tiu i la
atobuso al ...?'', ``Kiu la kajo por ...?'', ``Bonvolu al mi la
fakturon.'' ktp. Nu, tiun stilon oni ja povas toleri, kvankam
uste por i tiu celo mi preferus iom pli klasikan
frazkonstruon. Sed - por mi - nepre neadekvata estas la
nuda ``Bonvolu akvon'' por ``Could you bring some water, please''.
Alia apartao estas la preska konsekvenca evito de ``al'' kaj
prefero esprimi direkton per senprepozicia akuzativo (``u vi
povos in sendi Kanadon?'').<P>
Resume oni povas diri, ke ``Ni vojau!'' estas facile uzebla,
agrabla interaga ekzercilo kun lingve bona kaj prononce modela
lernmaterialo de modesta amplekso. Kiel praktikan aldonaon i
kunportas enerale uzeblan trutajpan tiparon por Esperanto

<H3>INTERNET</H3>
<H2><I>Teksao irka la tero</I></H2>
En la agusta numero de <I>MONATO</I> la artikolo ``Senpapera
revolucio'' raportis interalie pri diversaj aplikoj de la interreto
<I>(internet)</I>. Tiu eble plej konata el la komputilaj retoj iam estis
uzata precipe por sendi leterojn, poste anka teknikajn
artikoletojn kaj demandojn al elektronikaj diskut-forumoj en la
t. n. USENET.<P>
Tiuj tradiciaj aplikoj de la interreto estis nesinkronaj, t. e.
sendanto kaj ricevanto(j) ne aktivis samtempe, kaj la sendanto ne
tuj ricevis reagon. Necesis tiel, ar en la komencaj jaroj
retmesaoj ne malofte vojais kelkajn horojn, longe ripozante en
iuj interstacioj por atendi plusendadon.<P>
Nuntempe, la retoj farias pli rapidaj, kaj modernaj aplikoj de
la interreto ofte estas sinkronaj, tujreagaj. Homoj povas
komputile dialogi inter si, por kio kompreneble necesas, ke ili
estu maldormaj samtempe, kvankam eble loante en malsamaj
tempozonoj. Sed pli grava estas la eblo uzi la servojn de
malproksima komputilo kun preska tuja respondo.
<H4>Glitado sur elektronika surfo</H4>
Tiu rapida reago estis unu el la kondioj por eble la plej
sukcesa nuna apliko de la interreto: la tut-tera teksao (TTT),
anglalingve nomata<I> world-wide web, WWW</I> (tutmonda teksao a
araneao). i esence konsistas el amaso da komputilaj dosieroj,
tenataj en miloj da komputiloj ie en la mondo, kaj el
servil-programoj dissendantaj tiujn dosierojn lapete. Tiu
dissendo ordinare okazas ene de sekunderoj, kaj la rapideco estas
limigita nur per la plej malrapida peco de la liganta retolineo.<P>
Se oni scias la adreson, e kiu troveblas la dezirata informo
(tia adreso nomias URL,<I> uniform resource locator</I>, kio estas nur
pompa nomo por ``adreso''), oni povas tajpi in en sian
uzprogramon, kiu suos la dosieron kaj vidigos in sur la ekrano.
La dosiero povas enhavi pure tekstan informon a bildon, a i
povas esti en la HTML-formo (<I>HyperText Markup Language</I>,
hiperteksta markolingvo). Tiu formo permesas al la atoro ne nur
doni estetike belan formon al sia teksto, kun bildoj kaj titoloj,
subtitoloj kaj listoj en diversaj literspecoj, sed precipe la
enplekton de referencoj al aliaj dosieroj, situantaj sur la sama
a sur tute alia komputilo! Tiel la uzanto, kiu deziras klarigon
pri iu termino, povas tuj ricevi in alklakante per sia muso la
koncernan vorton. Kondio estas, ke la atoro de la dosiero (ofte
nomata ``pao'') ligis tiun vorton al la koncerna URL.<P>
Fanatikaj ``urologoj'' pasigas multajn horojn saltante de pao al
pao la la referencoj. Uzantoj kreis la nomon de ``surfado'' por
la sencela, sed plezura kaj ofte instrua drivado en la oceano da
ciferecaj informoj.
<H4>Anarkiisma strukturo</H4>
Same kiel la tuta interreto, la teksao estas organizita
malcentre; estus ege koste, se entute eble, centre administri
tian strukturon, kaj forprenus multe da spontaneeco. La sistemo
do estas memrega a, kiel kelkaj preferas, anarkiisma. iu ajn,
kies komputilo estas ligita al la reto, povas instali
TTT-servilon kaj proponi al la mondo siajn paojn, kun referencoj
al ajnaj aliaj paoj. Negativa flanko de tiu libereco estas, ke
serviloj kaj paoj povas malaperi sen averto, lasante sencelajn
referencojn en aliaj paoj. Tio estas unu prezo pagenda por
libereco; alia estas la ekzisto de eble nedezirindaj proponoj, kia
propagando de perfortemaj organizaoj.<P>
<B>Interagado<P>
</B></U></I>Kvankam TTT-uzanto plejparte pasive elektas kaj legas, ekzistas
paoj, sur kiuj eblas tajpi respondon. Tia respondo povas esti
letero al la verkinto de la pao, sed plej ofte i estas
plenigebla formularo, petanta iun reagon de fora komputilo. Tiu
servo povas esti uzata por komputilaj vortaroj: La uzanto tajpas
vorton en iu lingvo kaj ricevas novan paon kun la traduko, eble
e kun klarigo de tiu vorto. Tio ebligas aktualecon, kian papera
vortaro ne povas havi. Aliaj aplikoj estas informoj pri trajnaj
a aviadilaj horaroj, precize la la bezono de la petanto.<P>
<H4>Kiel trovi sian vojon?</H4>
Problemo estas, kiel uzanto trovu la informon, kiu interesas lin
a in. ar la teksao ne havas rigidan unuecan strukturon,
serado en iuj jam konataj paoj kaj iliaj referencoj estus
komplika kaj ofte senrezulta, komparebla al serado en
biblioteko, kie la libroj estas aranitaj nur la la nomoj de la
atoroj. Necesas latema katalogo, kaj tiajn katalogojn proponas
kelkaj institucioj, parte senkoste, parte nur al registritaj
uzantoj kontra pago. Estas klare, ke tiaj katalogoj povas esti
multe pli ampleksaj ol tiuj de tradicia biblioteko, ar
komputiloj estas tre paciencaj kaj laboremaj, kvankam nekleraj,
serantoj de losilvortoj. Tia katalog-komputilo regule legas
iun paon en iu TTT-servilo konata al i kaj registras la iel
interesajn vortojn sur tiuj paoj. Uzanto de la katalogo povas
doni kombinaon da tiaj vortoj kaj ricevas liston de iuj paoj,
kiuj enhavas ilin. Se tiuj paoj ne enhavas la deziratan
informon, la tieaj  referencoj estas bazo por plua serado.<P>
Ekzemple, uzanto, kiu demandas katalogon pri la vorto ``akademio'',
eble ricevos referencon al la pao <CODE>
http://www.uni-paderborn.de/extern/fb/2/AIS/ais.html. </CODE>De tiu pao
oni trovos ne nur la informojn pri AIS tenatajn en la
universitato de Paderborn, sed anka rilatajn informojn en aliaj
komputiloj.
<H4>Disvastianta komunikilo</H4>
Inter la proponantoj de TTT-paoj trovias universitatoj, kiuj
ofte permesas al siaj anoj prezenti proprajn paojn, sed anka
komercaj entreprenoj, reklamantaj siajn produktojn kaj servojn;
anka publikaj instancoj kiel registaroj, tataj oficejoj a
urboj varbantaj turistajn vojaantojn. Firmaoj en siaj tradiciaj
afioj kaj gazet-anoncoj diskonigas siajn TTT-adresojn. Magazinoj
kaj urnaloj senkoste prezentas elekton de siaj artikoloj, kun la
espero logi legantojn al la aeto de la tuta numero a al abono.
Kelkaj proponantoj, ekz. de sero-servoj, vendas parton de siaj
paoj por reklam-anoncoj.<P>
Malagrabla teknika detalo estas, ke la HTML-tekstformo
normigas is nun nur la literojn de iom grandaj okcidentaj
lingvoj, prezenteblaj per anglalingva nomo a ``#'' plus ciferoj
inter la signoj ``&amp'' kaj ``;''
, ekz. <KBD>&ampeacute;</KBD>  a<KBD> &amp#233;</KBD> por &#233;.
Signaroj de aliaj lingvoj estas uzeblaj, se la komputilo kapablas
vidigi ilin, sed ne estas eble ani la signaron ene de pao.
Estas malmulte da instigo por ani tion, ar multaj paoj estas
en la angla lingvo, anka en ne-anglalingvaj landoj, kaj cetere
la angla estas preska la sola uzata dua lingvo por TTT-paoj.
<H4>Riskoj</H4>
La ekesto de ``informaj oseoj'', datenaj lineoj kun granda
kapacito, certe plivastigos la uzon de la teksao kaj kreskigos
ian gravecon. Jam okazas vendoj per TTT kun pago per
kreditkarto, kio kompreneble enhavas la riskon, ke iu
subaskultas ties numeron kaj misuzos in. Por malhelpi tion,
kelkaj programoj proponas ifradon de la transsendataj datenoj
kaj avertas, se komunikado okazas neifrate. Sed anta io
necesas, ke la uzanto konsciu pri la eventualaj daneroj de la
nova sistemo.<P>
La unuaj osoj de TTT aperis anta nur du jaroj, kaj jam iaj
uzantoj estas milionoj. Per hejmaj komputiloj, pli facile
manipuleblaj uzprogramoj kaj malmultekosta telekomunikado i
rapide penetros en la vivon de la enerala publiko, de homoj sen
komputilistaj scioj. Restas malmulte da tempo por konsciigi al la
publiko la ancojn, sed anka la danerojn de la nova komunikilo.
Se tiu konsciio malsukcesos, povos okazi, ke TTT kreos novajn
laborejojn unuavice por krimuloj, kiuj uos la avantaon de
komforta hejmlaboro.<P>

<H2><I>La plej granda vortaro</I></H2>
Fine de septembro aperis sur lasera disko <I>Het Woordenboek der
Nederlandsche Taal </I>(La Vortaro de l' Nederlanda Lingvo),
supozeble la plej granda vortaro de l' mondo. i enhavas pli ol
40 milionoj da vortoj, kio en papera formo egalus al libro kun 42 000
paoj. Seri ion en tia libroforma
vortaro ne estus facile, ne nur pro ia
amplekso, sed anka pro la fakto, ke en la plimulto de la klarigoj
la verkintoj referencas al aliaj artikoloj, kiuj povas trovii
20 000 paojn poste a antae ... Jen do la plej grava kialo pro
kiu la eldonantoj entute rezignis pri ``libra'' eldono. La nuna
versio de la vortaro konsistas el nur unu lasera disko.<P>
Krom la kompakteco la lasera eldono havas kelkajn aliajn praktikajn
avantaojn: Se oni seras difinitan vorton, oni ne nur trovos
ian klarigon fulmrapide sed oni same renkontos
tuj iujn citaojn
en kiuj la vorto aperas. Same facile eblas trovi citaojn en kiuj la
vortoj A kaj B aperas, sed ne C kaj D, kaj similajn kombinojn.<P>
Anka krucvortenigmuloj ekde nun havas rapidan ilon: Trovi
vortojn el kiuj oni scias nur kelkajn literojn oni povas senpene.<P>
Interesa novao estas, ke la uzanto povas mem aldoni komentojn,
novajn citaojn kaj novajn vortojn al la vortaro, se li deziras
tion.<P>
Por povi ui la avantaojn de la vortaro oni bezonas IBM-kongruan
komputilon, la mastruman sistemon Windows 3.1, 4 megabajtojn da
efmemoro, 2 megabajtojn da libera diskospaco kaj, kompreneble,
legilon por laseraj diskoj. La prezo de la disko estas 1995 guldenoj.<P>

<H2><I>Valora konsultlibro</I></H2>
Jam de iom da tempo estas akirebla en Internet komputika
leksikono de Sergio Pokrovskij. Nun i aperis anka kiel libro e
``Sezonoj'' en Jekaterinburg.<P>
La papera versio estas fortike bindita kaj entenas 365 paojn.<I>
Komputika leksikono</I> estas kombino de vortaro angla-esperanta kaj
de enciklopedio kun esperantlingva klarigo kaj angla traduko.
Kelkfoje aperas anka tradukoj en aliaj lingvoj, ekz. germana,
franca kaj rusa. i entenas 1600 terminojn, kio unuavide aspektas
malmulte. La praktiko tamen montras, ke oni trovas en i iujn
iutagajn nociojn de teoria komputiko, programado,
mikrokomputiloj, surtabla tipografio kaj matematiko. Se pluraj
terminoj estas konsiderinde ofte uzataj, ili iuj aperas (ekz.
disketo/diskedo).<P>
La verko estas valora konsultlibro por iu, kiu interesias pri
komputiko. La papera versio estas aetebla e
<A HREF="mailto:fel@knooppunt.be">Flandra Esperanto-Ligo</A>
(660 BEF), e
UEA (36 NLG) kaj e iuj bonaj libroservoj. Rete i estas

<H3>WINDOWS 95</H3>
<H2><I>&#230;u sukceso, u malsukceso?</I></H2>
<I>MONATO </I>de oktobro 1995 raportis pri spertoj kun la nova versio
de la mastruma sistemo <I>Windows</I>. Intertempe pasis kelkaj
monatoj. Kia estas la nuna situacio?<P>
Ni nek adas, nek legas pri grandaj problemoj de uzantoj de
<I>Windows 95</I>. Tio povas signifi, ke la problemoj pri la
provversio estis ustatempe forigitaj.<P>
La ciferoj pri la vendoj de <I>Windows 95</I> estas kontradiraj. Ni
klopodis kunmeti el diversaj fontoj kelkajn informojn. La la
germana televido, Microsoft-estro Bill Gates deklaris post la
atuna komputila foiro <I>Comdex</I>, ke vendiis 20 milionoj da
ekzempleroj de <I>Windows 95</I>, 10 milionojn malpli ol oni esperis.
Aliflanke, je la 1a de decembro flandra gazeto <I>De Morgen</I> citis
la saman Bill Gates, kiu en intervjuo kun la usona <I>National
Public Radio</I> menciis 10 milionojn da ekzempleroj, do nur la
duonon! Aliflanke la la usona stacio CNN, la lano en Japanio
fine de novembro estis granda sukceso.<P>
La usona revuo <I>PC Magazine</I> regule aperigas liston de la 10
plej bone venditaj programoj. Kunmetante tiujn listojn pri la
4 semajnoj sekvintaj la lanon de <I>Windows 95</I> (fine de
agusto), oni povas konkludi, ke en Usono la jenaj programoj
estis la plej sukcesaj (ni kunigis la nombrojn pri novaj
versioj kaj pri isdatigoj de malnovaj versioj):<P>
<I>Windows 95<BR>
Microsoft Plus<BR>
Norton Antivirus </I>por<I> Windows 95<BR>
Microsoft Word</I> por<I> Windows 95<BR>
Norton Utilities</I> por <I>Windows 95<BR>
SoftRAM 95<BR>
Norton Navigator</I> por <I>Windows 95<P>
Microsoft Plus</I> estas aro da kromprogramoj preska necesa por
efike uzi je <I>Windows 95. </I>Norton trifoje aperas en la listo kun
programoj, kiuj igas la uzon de Windows 95 pli sekura a pli
facila. &#230;u jen indiko, ke uzantoj ne tute fidas je <I>Windows 95?
Word</I> estas verkilo (tekstoprilabora programo) de Microsoft,
kaj estas logike aeti in samtempe kun <I>Windows 95.</I><P>
Plej interesa estas la apero de <I>SoftRAM 95.</I> Estas konate, ke
Microsoft konsilas instali 8-16 megabajtojn da efmemoro.
Kvankam enerale la prezoj de aparataro falas, la prezoj de
efmemoro tamen emas altii (modulo de 4 MB kostas minimume
200 USD). Lastatempe aperis pluraj programoj, i.a. <I>SoftRAM</I>,
kiuj klopodas pli efike utiligi (la reklamoj: duobligi) la
memoron de la komputilo. La prezoj varias inter 50 kaj 100
USD; opinioj pri tiaj programoj estas malbonaj. Pro multaj
problemoj, <I>SoftRAM</I> ne plu estas vendata en Germanio nek en
Usono.<P>

<H3>LA ANGLA</H3>
<H2><I>Dekadenco de lingvo</I></H2>
Kiu studas la anglan en historia kunteksto ne povas ne konstati,
ke la lingvo dare evoluis kaj aniis tra la jarcentoj,
kiel iuj fenomenoj. Sed hodiaaj homoj scias, ke evoluo ne
iam signifas plibonion, sed enerale similas la vivon de
unuopa homo de naskio is kadukio. ajnas al mi, ke dum
la nuna jarcento senteble komenciis kriza dekadenco de la angla
lingvo.<P>
La preciza kaj senmanka uzado de lingvo estas socie tre grava,
kaj malpreciza lingvao facile trompas la homojn - rigardu ekzemple
televidajn reklamojn kaj analizu la precizan signifon de uzitaj
frazoj: oni klopodas sugestii, se eble sen (rimarkotaj) mensogoj.
Askultu la ofte svagajn prononcojn de la politikistoj, kiuj
celas krei impresojn kiel eble plej malkonkrete. Tiu lasta ja
ne estas fenomeno nova, sed hodia oni malpli kritike akceptas
misdirektitajn semantikaojn ol en epokoj pli lingve konsciaj.
<H4>Angla apogeo</H4>
Estas prave akceptate, ke la lingvao de ekspiro estas iasence
la apogeo de la angla: ia sola rivalo estas la angla biblio
de Reo Jakobo. Tiurilate notindas du aferoj: tiuj samtempaj
verkoj estas nur la krono de epoko enerale bellingva; kaj amba
estis direktitaj al popolo kiu kutimis askulti <B>kaj enerale
kompreni</B> altnivelan lingvaon, kiun ili adis en iudimanaj
predikoj longedaraj en siaj preejoj, kaj e teatraj prezentadoj
kiuj grave kontribuis al ilia liberhora distrio. ekspiro
kaj multaj aliaj dramverkistoj deziris kaj ricevis popularecon,
kaj ilia lingvao ne estis nur de intelektula elito frandata.<P>
Kvankam la lingvo aniis dum la du jarcentoj post ekspiro,
tamen i restis respektata, kun granda vortprovizo kaj vigla
frandata stilo: la populareco de Dickens kaj aliaj atoroj inter
homoj iuklasaj pruvas tion. Estas grave en tiu kunteksto memori
pri la fakto, ke iu homo posedas du specojn de lingvo: tiun
kiun li mem aktive uzas, kaj tiun kiun li mem ne uzas sed tamen
bone komprenas. ajnas al mi, ke en la nuna tempo amba specoj
enerale rumpas.
<H4>Dekadenco</H4>
En la unua kvarono de la 20a jarcento, geniaj atoroj komencis
rimarki tion, notinde la usonano Ezra Paund kaj la irlandano James
Joyce, kaj ili reagis pozitive, iu la sia maniero. Bedarinde
tio rezultigis, ke iliaj verkoj iis nealireblaj por grandaj
tavoloj de la popoloj.<P>
Diversaj faktoroj kontribuas al dekadenco de lingvo. Ekzemple
semantika malprecizio. Se oni komparas anglan tekston el la
13a jarcento kun la hodiaa lingvo, oni facile konstatas, ke
multaj vortoj anis sian signifon; ekzemple <I>silly</I> signifis
felia, bonanca, nun signifas stulta. Tio hodia ne kazas
al ni enojn. Sed dum transira periodo tio ja enas kaj la
lingvon malprecizigas. Kaj la 20a jarcento estas periodo forte
transira. El miloj da ekzemploj mi citas unu tipan: oni komencis
konfuzi la vortojn<I> uninterested</I> (sen interesio) kaj
<I> disinterested </I>
(netrala, senpartia). Tial kiam homo diras <I>I'm disinterested
in that</I>, oni jam ne scias tuj, u mankas al li intereso a konvinkio.<P>
Alia faktoro estas lamodaj klioj, ofte komence metaforaj.
Tiaj klioj iam ekzistis, kompreneble, sed pro la modernaj
komunikrimedoj ili funde penetras senprokraste en la laran socion,
kaj iuj papagas ilin en iaj kuntekstoj, tiel ke ili balda
povas signifi ion a nenion. Oni emas diri ilin kvaza ili
solvus a resumus problemojn a vidpunktojn, sen la neceso tiujn
vere esplori. Similan rolon ludas la efemismoj, kvaza ano
de termino forigas la fenomenon mem (homoj ne plu estas<I> blind,</I>
ili estas <I>visually handicapped</I>); tiel oni traktas problemojn rasajn,
seksajn, sociajn, klasajn - la fenomenoj tamen ne malaperas,
nur kaias.
<H4>Homa egaleco</H4>
Kial do disvastiis la lingva dekadenco? Plej kulpas la doktrino
de homa egaleco, kiu, apud multaj bonaj kaj necesaj plibonigoj
de la homa situacio, kondukis al diigo de la mezkvalito a e
submezkvalito kaj al anatemo de pli altaj kriterioj (jes!) per
ankora unu klio: elitismo. Kio ne estas komuna, tio estas
malakceptinda. Unuavide nenio estas pli komuna ol komuna lingvo;
sed lingvo vere komuna fakte estas baza, simpla kaj malpreciza.
Oni en nia jarcento emas moki tiujn, kiuj celas esprimi sin pli
klere (``u vi englutis vort-libron?'').<P>
Kulpas anka la fakto, ke la plej fortaj lingvaj modeloj kaj
influoj en nia epoko estas tre ofte televidaj prezentistoj, kiuj
estas, a ajnas esti, analfabetoj kaj malkleruloj. Populareco
anta io! Oni malalte taksas la sagacon de la granda homamaso,
kaj tre multaj homoj akceptas tion kiel norman.<P>
Kaj la komerca lingvao! Hodia la belajn klarajn vortojn de
la 23a Psalmo: ``La Eternulo estas mia patisto; mi mankon ne havos
... Kaj mi restos en la domo de la Eternulo eterne'', oni prefere
tradukas: <I>The Lord and I are in a shepherd-sheep situation, and
I am in a position of negative need ... And I will possess tenant
rights in the housing unit of the Lord on a permanently open-ended
time basis.</I><P>
En mallonga artikolo mi povas tui nur suprae mian temon, kaj
vere tre simplige. Sed menciindas ankora unu grava faktoro
en dekadencio de la angla lingvo. Temas pri ties internaciio.
ia uzado en rolo por kiu i tre malmulte tauas kazas erarojn
kaj adaptojn tre misgustajn, kiujn iom post iom kaj vole-nevole
devas akcepti indienaj parolantoj. Tiuj siavice emas simpligi
kaj adapti la lingvon konforme al la kriterioj de eksterlandaj
parolantoj (kaj instruistoj!). Tre kulpas anka tiuj admirindaj
homoj, kiuj strebas plenumi neeblaon: la interpretistoj.<P>
Mi amas mian denaskan lingvon. Tiom pli maloje do mi spektas
ian putinion.<P>

<H2><I>Signifa Akademio</I></H2>
Planlingvoj havas siajn atorojn, sed tiuj konscias, ke iam ili
devos fordoni sian lingvogvidan pozicion. Zamenhof opiniis tiun
tempon veninta en Bulonjo-sur-Maro: li instigis, ke la
esperantistoj fondu en 1905 Lingvan Komitaton, el kiu tuj poste
evoluis la Akademio de Esperanto.<P>
Tiu i Akademio servis ekde tiam sen interrompo al la
esperantista lingvokomunumo. Aliaj planlingvoj ne uis tiun
avantaon. La Volapuk-Kongreso 1889 en Parizo kontestis al
Schleyer [lajr] la rajton disponi pri la lingvo kaj fondis la
<I>Kadem bev&#252;netik Volap&#252;ka</I> (<I>kadem</I> = akademio).<P>
La tiel komenciinta disputo kondukis al disfalo. La volapuka
akademio poste fariis la<I> Akademi Internasional</I> pledanta por la
planlingvo <I>Idiom Neutral</I>. Pli poste i transformiis en <I>Academia
pro Interlingua</I> okupiantan pri <I>Latino sine flexione</I>.<P>
La <I>Ido-Akademio</I> alprenis inter 1908 kaj 1913, do dum nur kvin
jaroj, 1000 decidojn pri sia planlingvo. Kursgvidanto do devis
dum sia lingvokurso instrui jen tiun kaj jen alian regulon. Tial
fariis necese konstitui periodon de stabileco.<P>
Evidente planlingvaj akademioj staras en la tensio inter
senmovio kaj adaptio. Kiuj postkuris disirantajn evoluojn, tiuj
pereis. Evoluo necesas. Kiu volus fari in malebla, tiu sufokas
sian lingvon. Kiel iam: bezonata estas aktivado en la usta
mezuro.<P>
Tio povas signifi anka nur apudstari kaj observi. Tiel akademio
estas komparebla kun la situacio de la gardanta instruisto sur la
korto de lernejo dum la pazo, kiam la lernantoj refreias, sed
anka inklinas al luktetoj. Kiom longe la instruisto ne devas
interveni, io estas (ankora) akceptebla. Nur kiam la lernantoj
tro forte interpuias, ordigo necesas.<P>
Tial nenionfarado povas esti pozitiva signo. ia antakondio
estas, ke zorga observado pravigis tiun retenemon. Tiam i ne
estu miskomprenata kiel simpla maldiligento. Fari ion, ar tio
estas bela pruvo pri ies ekzisto, estas nur aktivismo, sen senco
kaj utilo.<P>
La Akademio de Esperanto prezentis siajn farojn dum la lastaj
jardekoj en tri libroj nomataj <I>Aktoj de la Akademio I</I> is <I>III</I> (de
1963 is 1991 -<I> Aktoj IV</I> estas planata por 1998). i klopodis pri
la usta mezuro de aktivado. Decidoj pri etaj demandoj kiel
komunao/komunumo listias apud profunde skuantaj problemegoj
kiel ata/ita.<P>
En tiu maniero la Akademio de Esperanto darigos. Tion diktas al
i ia statuto: ``konservi kaj protekti la fundamentajn principojn
de la lingvo Esperanto kaj kontroli ian evoluon''. Tiun
kontroltaskon surmetas al i anka la statuto de UEA, al kiu
estas alkroitaj iaj landaj asocioj kun ties ekzamenaj fakoj.<P>
Institucio kun la rajto valide difini vortojn estas bezonata en
internacia lingvo, kiu kompreneble ne havas la naciajn instancojn
fiksantajn terminojn.<P>
Tutmonde konataj estas kreditkartoj. Apud ili ekzistas kartetoj
de bankoj, kiuj per sekreta numero ebligas preni monon el
atomatoj. La bankoj de diversaj landoj donis malsamajn nomojn al
ili.<P>
Neniu esperantisto povas simple traduki sian enlande kutiman
terminon. La eksterlanda ekvivalento estas la tiulande kutima
fakvorto. En Germanio i estas <I>ec-Karte</I> (= ekkarto), en Britio
<I>debit card</I> (= debetkarto), en Nederlando <I>PIN-kaart </I>kaj en
Flandrio <I>bankkaart </I>(= bankkarto).<P>
Kiel i do nomiu en Esperanto? Pri nomo iulande komprenata de
la esperantistoj devas okazi decido, al kiu poste iuj sekvos.<P>
La Akademio de Esperanto prilaboras iujn lingvajn demandojn de
sia lingvo, kaj la terminara laboro okupas aparte gravan lokon.
Anka tiel i plenumas sian servan rolon en la movado kaj
kunhelpas al la bezonata evoluo en stabileco.<BR>

Katamito:
<P>
seksologia faktermino
</H2>
u eblas neambigue nomi en Esperanto njo-knabon, kiu en
Plena Ilustrita Vortaro (PIV) estas difinita kiel ``knabo
pederastie amata''? ajnas, ke Gaston Waringhien estis la
unua, kiu registris tiun esprimon en Esperanta vortaro
(<I>Grand Dictionnaire Espranto-Franais</I>,
1957). La franca ekvivalento estas <I>mignon</I>, signita
kiel historia termino. <I>Plena Analiza Gramatiko
(PAG)</I> atribuas al R. Rossetti la uzon de njo-knabo por
nomi la favoraton de perversa reo (<I>mignon</I>). Pli
fruaj francaj Esperanto-vortaroj tradukis <I>mignon</I>
per ``amato'' kaj per adjektivoj kiel ``gracia'', ``arma''.
Anka la <I>Grand Dictionnaire
Franais-Espranto</I> (1992) e <I>mignon</I>
registras la historian signifon per ``njo-knabo''. Du aliaj
vortoj estis proponitaj por la sama koncepto. En sia traduko
de <I>La inenia hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha</I>,
Fernando de Diego enkondukis la neologismon ``garzono'', kaj en
verkoj de William Auld trovias la samsignifa vorto ``drudo''.
La atoroj de <I>Tabuaj vortoj en Esperanto</I>, Hektor
Alos kaj Kiril Velkov, signas ``garzono'' simple kiel
neologismon kun la signifo de ``njo-knabo''. Tiu i estas
neprecize difinita kiel ``ineca virsamseksemulo'' kaj havas la
etikedon ``argono'' (``pika vorto, kiu ne uzindas en pruda
konversacio''). Jen stranga difino de argono!

<H3>Obetoj kontra ``njo-knabo''
</H3>
Efektive, ``njo-knabo'' ne estas tute kontentiga esprimo.
Unue, i estas unu el la t.n. netravideblaj kunmetitaj vortoj
en Esperanto, kies signifo ne estas neambigue komprenebla
surbaze de la partoj. Njo-knabo povas esti tutsimple kara a
arma knabeto kun kelkaj inecaj trajtoj, sen iu ajn aludo al
seksa agado. Estas atentinde, ke PIV ne apartigas in de la
ordinara nivelo de lingvouzo, do i ne estas ``argono'', kaj
anka pruduloj povas uzi in en siaj konversacioj. Dua
obeto kontra ``njo-knabo'' rilatas al ia anomalia formado
per ``njo-'' uzata prefikse. ``-Nj/o'' estas fundamenta
sufikso, kiu estas almetebla post iu ajn el la kvin unuaj
literoj de virina propra nomo por formi karesan derivaon:
Margarita - Manjo. i estas sammaniere uzebla kun
parenc-substantivoj: patrino - panjo. Tria rimarko pri
``njo-knabo'' estas ia relative malofta uzo en la lingvo.
E post registrado en PIV en 1970, ne iuj leksikografoj
inkludis in en vortaroj publikigitaj post tiu dato.

<H3>La neologismo ``katamito''

</H3>Por anstatai
``njo-knabo'' mi proponas la neologismon ``katamito'', kiu
devenas de <I>catamite</I>, uzata en la anglalingva
seksologia fakliteraturo. i venas de la etruska nomo
<I>Catmite</I>, variao de la helena person-nomo
<I>Ganimedes</I>. En la helena mitologio Ganimedo estis
bela patista knabo, kiu tiel ravis Zeson, la reon de la
dioj, ke li sendis sian aglon por forporti la knabon al Monto
Olimpo, kie li servis kiel veristo de nektaro e la bankedoj
de la dioj. Por la reviziata eldono de PIV mi proponas jenajn
novajn difinojn de du terminoj, kun la celo elimini neustajn
kaj malnovmodajn karakterizaojn pri ``deflankio'' kaj
``nenormaleco''.
<P>
Bernard G<FONT SIZE=-1>OLDEN
<P>
1. sodomio: <I>(Plena Ilustrita Vortaro)</I> deflankio
de la vira seksimpulso, nenormale direktianta al viroj.
(reviziita difino) unu el la formoj de vira samseksemo, en kiu
du <I>plenkreskuloj</I> plenumas anuskoitadon.
<P>
2. pederastio: <I>>(Plena Ilustrita Vortaro)</I> deflankio
de la vira seksimpulso, kiu nenormale direktias al junaj
knaboj. (reviziita difino) anuskoitado inter plenkreskulo
(pederastiulo) kaj juna knabo (katamito).

<H2><I>La ukraina</I></H2>
La ukraina lingvo iis vere tata lingvo nur post la disfalo de
Sovetio. Anta tiam - kvankam formale la sovetiaj respublikoj
estis suverenaj tatoj - la uzado de naciaj lingvoj iis de jaro
al jaro pli malvasta.<P>
La atoro de tiu i artikolo lois dum . 20 jaroj en la altaja
regiono de Siberio, kie - milojn da kilometroj de Ukrainio -
vivas en diversaj lokoj ukrainoj je la frakcio de 1/3 is 2/3 de
la loantaro. La lingvo estas kaj estis tie parolata en la
iutaga vivo, sed nur neoficiale. Se vi parolas ukraine en iu
oficejo, oni nepre diros al vi: ``Parolu ruse!'' (kvankam multaj
ukrainoj anka nun parolas nur fuan rusan).<P>
La atoro multfoje vizitis orientan Ukrainion. La situacio anta
la ``perestrojkaj'' jaroj estis tie preska la sama, kiel en
Siberio. Ekz. urbo kun 400 mil loantoj rajtis havi nur unu
ukrainan lernejon.<P>
Nuntempe por . 40 milionoj da ukrainoj, loantaj en la propra
tato, la situacio plene aliiis, sed ... la la ukrainlingva
gazetaro en Rusio loas 15 milionoj da ukrainoj. Por tiuj homoj
la espero iam lerni la gepatran lingvon en lernejoj, havi
proprajn gazetaron kaj radio-elsendojn estas plej verajne
perdita.<P>
La ukraina lingvo historiskale estas relative juna. Anta la 14a
jarcento la praukraina kaj la prarusa lingvoj estis la sama
lingvo - malnovrusa. Ekz. la literaturan monumenton <I>Kanto pri
militiro de Igor</I> (12a jarcento) la rusoj konsideras kiel
monumenton de la rusa lingvo, sed ukrainoj kiel tiun de la
ukraina lingvo. Kaj amba estas pravaj.<P>
La ukraina lingvo estas preska klasika hinderopa lingvo, i
havas preska iujn kategoriojn de latino: du nombrojn de la
substantivo, 3 genrojn, 7 kazojn (inkluzive vokativon), 3 modojn
kaj 4 tempojn de la verbo.<P>
La kategorio de difiniteco-nedifiniteco en la ukraina lingvo
estas esprimata ne tiel evidente, kiel en Esperanto kaj en
okcidentaj lingvoj. Artikoloj forestas. Se estas neceso esprimi
tiun kategorion, por esprimo de difiniteco estas uzataj formoj de
l' pronomo <I>cej</I> = ``i'', kaj por nedifiniteco - formoj de l'
numeralo <I>odyn</I> = ``unu''. Estas anka aliaj, pli malofte uzataj
formoj por esprimi tiun kategorion.<P>
Tiel same statas en la plimulto de la aliaj slavaj lingvoj.<P>
La ukraina, estanta ``preska klasika'' hinderopa lingvo, estas
nesimpla por lernado. La gramatiko de la ukraina lingvo estas
proksimume tiel ampleksa, kiel la latina.<P>
La leksiko de l' ukraina lingvo havas grandan tavolon da
hinderopaj vortoj. Ankora pli granda tavolo estas vortoj krome
de la slava vortaro. Kune kun tio multnombraj estas pure ukrainaj
vortoj, kiujn ne konas aliaj slavaj lingvoj, e la plej proksimaj
- la rusa kaj la belorusa.<P>
Kaj finfine estas necese diri ion pri iu lingva enigmo. La rusa
kaj la ukraina lingvoj estas tre proksimaj, sed ...<P>
La ukraina lingvo estas multe pli humureca. Tio estas apena
klarigebla el la lingvistika vidpunkto. Sed mi, la atoro, estas
denaska ruso kaj samtempe ukraino, kaj povas vidi ke neniu
traduko povas esti atentika, e por lingvoj tiel proksimaj kiel
la rusa kaj la ukraina.<P>
Iam en Sovetio estis tre popularaj aktoroj Timoenko kaj Berezin.
La unua estas ukraino, la dua ruso. Ili estis amuzaj, ar Berezin
parolis ruse, sed Timoenko ukraine. Se ili amba parolus ruse,
perdius konsiderinde la humuro.<P>
Se oni tradukas ukrainan humuraon rusen, ofte ruse i estas
malpli komika ...<BR>

<H2><I>Uzi la leon por reklami</I></H2>
Post la lastaj elektoj en Belgio, dum la politikaj partioj
intertraktis pri la formado de la nova registaro, la efaj
partioj - kies efa bezono estis la reorganizo de la belga
tatstrukturo - bezonis la verdulojn por povi finfari la
intertraktadojn pozitive. Por la konsento de la verduloj ili
devis pagi per eko-imposto. La verduloj postulis, ke oni
enkonduku specialan imposton sur tiuj produktoj, kiuj aras la
medion. Varoj impostotaj estas i.a. baterioj, foretendaj
foto-aparatoj, raziloj kaj plastaj boteloj.<P>
Malgra promesoj, multaj el tiuj impostoj is nun ne realiis.
Plej ofte ar la industrio kaj la distribuantoj - la grandaj
vendejoj - deklaris, ke ne eblas atingi la postulataojn en la
proponita tempo. Tamen, ili ja preparis sin por la neevitebla,
kaj tio bone videblas en la reklamado - kiu pli kaj pli okazas
sur recikla papero.<P>
Unu el la efaj distribuantoj sendis al siaj klientoj
reklamfolion, kiu klarigis la reorganizon de ia
trinka-distribuado. Fakte, is nun ne temas  pri enerala
industria regulo, sed almena antavideblas baldaa enkonduko
enerala. La efa ano estas, ke la kompanio enkondukos novan botelon,
por kiu i kalkulos kromprezon, poste repagotan se oni reportas
la botelon. Kvankam tiu botelo estas pli malpli duoble pli peza ol
foretenda botelo, la medio-gajno estas impona. La elirpunkto,
ke iu familio uzas unu botelon tage, la kvanto de plasta rubo
jare falos de 15,33 kg al 1,67 kg.<P>
Dua novao estas, ke la firmo reuzos anka vinbotelojn -
denove nur de vinoj, kiujn i mem enboteligas. La medio-gajno de
tiu decido estas e multe pli impona (vidu tabelon).<P>

<P>
Meza ajno de 50 % en iuj terenoj, krom akvo; kaj e 66 % e la
brula-kostoj certe pravigas la penon. Je la negativa flanko de
la bilanco trovias la pli alta valoro de akvo-malpurigado kaj la
pli granda stokejo, kiun oni bezonas. En la vendejoj oni bezonos
is 30 % pli da spaco sur la trinka-bretoj, se iuj markoj de
trinkaoj anos sian politikon favore al reuzeblaj boteloj.<P>
Anka pligrandigo kaj plimodernigo de la lavpuriginstalaoj
signifas grandan koston, tamen kompenseblan per la malpli granda
nombro da bezonataj boteloj: nur unu anstata 6 a 7.<P>
Ekonomia gajno - sed eble entreprena kosto - estas la 98 pliaj
laboristoj, kiujn bezonas la novaj instalaoj. Por la 500&#160;000 senlaboruloj, tio tamen certe ne faras gravan diferencon.<P>
Kompreneble oni nur povas oji, ke granda entrepreno faras tian
decidon. Tamen restas la demando: se la gajno estas tiel impona,
kaj la kosto tiel bagatela, kial ne jam anta dek jaroj la
kompanio faris tiun decidon, pri kiu verduloj jam longe
sopiras.<P>

<H3>TERMINOLOGIO</H3>
<H2><I>Toponimio ukraina</I></H2>
La ukazo de prezidanto Leonid Kuma, eklaboris ukraina komisiono
por jura terminologio. Unu el iaj precipaj taskoj
estas la konfirmado de normoj por transdono de alilingvaj
propraj nomoj ukraine kaj de ukrainaj en aliaj lingvoj.<P>
Dum la unua kunsido la komisiono traktis la problemon, ke la
skribmaniero ``Kiev'' ne redonas la fonetik-grafismajn specifaojn de la
ukraina geografia nomo por la efurbo, kaj decidis, ke al i
respondas la latinalfabeta skribo Kyiv. Do, konsidere tiun fakton,
estas proponata la Esperanta nomo Kijivo...<P>
La sama normo koncernas la skribon de malgranda ukraina urbeto,
mondfama pro la atomcentrala katastrofo. Oni devas transdoni
Esperante tiun lokonomon kiel ornobilo.<P>

<H2>
<I>Policanoj kun problemoj</I>
</H2>
Nenio homa estas perfekta, sed la brita polico estas,
verajne, inter la pli bonaj policoj; kutime sekvas
regulojn, respondas al alvokoj de ordinaraj civitanoj,
penas ne nur kapti krimulojn, sed diversmaniere helpi
nin ceterajn kaj, grave, preventi krimojn kaj
akcidentojn. Mi mem, kiam mi aetis mian hejmon,
ricevis, tute senpage, valorajn konsilojn pri
dom-sekureco de la loka Oficiro Krim-preventa, e
skribitan raporton. Mi memoras amikinon el fora lando,
kiu unue tre timis, poste miris, kiam surstrate mi iris
al policano por peti informon, kaj li entile informis...
<H4>Sed, kelkfoje...</H4>
Nu, pri aresto de krimuloj: policanoj en suda Anglio
ricevis averton, ke iu danera ulo, kun pafilo, sidas
en atomobilo, kaj gvatas. Tuja respondo. Rapidaj
atoj. Sireno. Radioaparatoj. Kuraa preteco. Kaj jen,
temis pri hom-granda kartona silueto, ia reklamilo por
filmo...
<P>
Pri savo de civitano en danero: policanoj rimarkis
belan virinon, lukse vestitan (ora robo kun multaj
kvastoj, brile verdaj trumpoj!), kiu flosis sur parka
lago en Brighton - jes, Brajtono, urbo de la 74a
universala kongreso - certe drononta! Bravaj policanoj
senhezite pretiis por savi in, eble us enfalintan
post tutnokta festo kun iom da kemiaj gajigiloj ... sed
i klarigis kohere ke i kuas komforte sur giganta
plasta folio akvolilia, iun merkredan matenon dum
duonhoro. Kial? En ia artfestivalo i ludas la rolon de
vizitanta marvirino...
<P>
Kaj kiam temas pri prevento: bonaj civitanoj ne hezitu
averti la policon, se io ajnas suspektiga; iuj
policanoj ja deoras tra la nokto. Do, en mez-anglia
urbo Market Drayton [Maket Drejtn], preventemaj
civitanoj telefonis la policejon, ar silentaj,
sinkaantaj figuroj teliris de ardeno al ardeno,
proksimiis al efpordoj. Kun kia fia intenco?
<P>
Fakte, temis pri kelkaj nokte deorantaj policanoj,
kiuj kaptis la okazon, dum siaj rutinaj rondiroj,
kviete ovi tra pordotruojn demandarojn pri
krim-preventado!

<H3>LETERO EL SARAJEVO</H3>
<H2><I>Cigaredoj</I></H2>
<I>Mi neniam estis fumanto. Anka mia edzino, krom en kelkaj
frivolaj studjaroj, ne cigaredumis - bonance! Kvankam la fumado
min ne multe enis, mi iam pli simpatiis kun fervoraj
kontrafumantoj, kiuj lanis plurajn sloganojn (``Kiu fumas sin
konsumas'') kaj organizis diversajn kampanjojn.<P>
Sed la objekto de ilia (mal)zorgo fariis subite anka mia okupo.
Mi memoras, ke kiam mi legis beletron kun milita fono, la tabako
estis nepreterebla afero. ian plurfunkcian karakteron mi
ekkomprenis nur kiam balda post la militkomenco parton de la
salajro ni ricevis en cigared-skatoletoj. Unuatempe la pakaojn
mi disdonis al amikoj kaj kolegoj fumantoj. Pro disfalo de la
disvenda reto cigaredoj estis malfacile haveblaj, tial pri iu
donacita skatoleto ili ege ojis, agrablege surpriziis.<P>
En Sarajevo estas granda tabak-fabriko fondita anta pli ol cent
jaroj kaj liveranta iutage produktojn por milionoj da
konsumantoj. iaj stokejoj de krudaoj estis evidente plenegaj,
ar i post la blokio de la urbo darigis, ja en multe malpli
granda amplekso, la produktadon por Sarajevo - efe por la
defendantoj de la urbo kaj pagipovaj entreprenoj.<P>
La tabak-fabriko dum longa tempo kvaza transprenis la rolon de
emisia banko. Pro la halto de kutimaj ekonomiaj fluoj kaj manko
de aliaj varoj, kelkaj entreprenoj, anka la mia, komencis ``pagi''
nin per cigaredoj. Kutima monata rekompenco estis irka 30
skatoletoj.<P>
Sekve de fermitaj livervojo, manko de nutraoj en Sarajevo draste
sentiis. La de-temp-al-tempa helpo de filantropiaj organizaoj
estis tute nesufia. La prezoj nigramerkataj de nutraoj galope
altiadis. Dum longa tempo kilogramo da faruno kostis 10
germanajn markojn, da sukero 100 markojn, da rizo 15 markojn,
litro da man-oleo 60 markojn. Elekto de aliaj artikloj estis
vere modesta, sed kion bezonis almena nia familio estis minimume
lakto-pulvoro (50 DEM) pro la infanoj, kaj kafo (120 DEM) pro nia
hejma ``malvirto''. Sed anka la prezo de unu cigared-skatolo
stabiliis je 5-7 DEM.<P>
Sur improvizitaj vendoplacoj a prefere vendoanguloj la sola
akceptata valuto estis la germana marko kaj la sola konvertebla
varo estis cigared-skatoleto. Fakte preska la tuta etkomerco
okazis per cigaredoj. Malofte iu per kontanta mono aetis iun
varon, escepte de la cigaredoj mem. En nia najbarejo oni kelkfoje
adis, ke iu fralino por prepari geedzian kukon pagis per
germanaj markoj e du kilogramojn da sukero!<P>
Tiel do paradokse, kvankam ni ne favoras in, la tabako fariis
nia plej favorata ao. El mia cigareda salajro mi povis monate
aeti ekzemple duonkilogramon da sukero, du kilogramojn da rizo,
duonkilogramon da laktopulvoro kaj litron da man-oleo! Kion
havigi decidis mia edzino depende de la hejma kaj merkata
situacioj.<P>
erce ni parolis: ``Se Romon savis anseroj, Sarajevon savis
cigaredoj!'' Anka nun, post kiam la urbon eniris dum la lastaj
monatoj sufie da nutrao kaj ia prezo iel normaliis, la
cigaredoj ne perdis sian konverteblon. Unu skatoleto kostas,
anka en tataj vendejoj, unu germanan markon, kaj per ili
preska ie eblas pagi a uzi ilin kiel moneron. Tial por kutima
salajro, kiu dare efe estas cigareda, nun eblas aeti e dek
kilogramojn da sukero a dek litrojn da man-oleo.<P>
Tamen en la tuta afero la plej granda enigmo por mi restis la
fumantoj mem, nome ilia ekonomia sistemo. Kiamaniere ili entute
havigadis monon (germanajn markojn) por cigaredoj, a simple kion
ili, krom fumi, fakte manis? Eble pro respekto al ilia pasio a
mi mem ne scias pro kiu kialo, mi rimarkis, ke la tabak-fumo tute
ne plu enas min ...<P>

<H2><I>Mortigo en la atobuso</I></H2>
<I>En sarajeva tramo hiera estis gravege vundita 30-jara virino.
Kuracistoj diris, ke malmultas la ancoj pri savo de ia
vidkapablo. La sinjorino sidis efenestre, kiam subite pafisto
celis la veturantan tramon. La kugloj venis kompreneble de la
sieanta flanko.<P>
La funkciado de la publika urba transporto, precipe de la atataj
tramoj, signifas revenon de la normala urba vivritmo. La tramoj
veturas lalonge de la precipaj urbaj stratoj, kilometrojn
longaj; tie ili facile submetias al pafistoj a artilerio. La
plej daneran sarajevan avenuon, kiun de la sieantoj disigas nur
malaltaj konstruaoj, paralela avenuo kaj rivereto, eksterlandaj
urnalistoj nomis ``aleo de pafistoj''. Okazis tie multaj murdoj -
mi mem pri unu iis atestanto.<P>
Okazis tio komence de la milito, en junio de 1992. La tramoj ne
funkciis pro la detruita elektro-reto; anstata tramoj ekfunkciis
atobusoj. Mi rapidis al la urbocentro por labori en la agadgrupo
``Savu homecon'' fondita por dokumenti la militan detruadon,
malobservojn de homaj rajtoj kaj krimojn kontra la homeco, jam
dum tri monatoj abunde praktikatajn tra la tuta Bosnio.<P>
Pro tumulto mi apena sukcesis enpuii en la atobuson. Mi
staris e sidloko, kie e fenestro jam sidis maljuna sinjoro,
certe pli ol 60-jaraa. Li legis urnalon. La atobuso e novaj
haltejoj malfacile povis akcepti pliajn pasaerojn. Post la tria
haltejo ni proksimiis al lernejoj: tri mezlernejoj kaj du
natursciencaj fakultatoj. Vidalvide, malanta ili, transrivere
estas la sieantoj.<P>
Kiam la atobuso troviis inter la fakultataj konstruaoj,
adiis fortega obtuza frapo. Mi tuj rimarkis, ke en atobusa
fenestro estas truo, sed la atobuso pluveturis. La sinjoro, kiu
legis la gazeton, ankora pli klinis la kapon. Post sekundo
sinjorino apud li ekkriis: ``Sango, sango!'' La atobuso haltis.
Kompreninte, kio us okazis, mi kun aliaj admonis: ``Veturu al
Vrazova!'' La oforo akcelis for. La morte vunditan sinjoron ni
klinis al la fenestro. El lia kapo, malsupren, la la kolo, fluis
malhela densa sango. En strato Vrazova, al iuj konata, staris
sandomo por ura medicina helpo. Alkuris medicinistoj kaj
kuracistoj. Sur brankardo ili forportis la vunditan sinjoron kaj
je mia surprizo anka sinjorinon, same pli ol 60 jarojn aan.<P>
Mi estis okita. Sango-flakoj en la atobuso, sur la trotuaro.
Ankora pli mi okiis, kiam iom poste mi adis en la radio, ke
en la urba atobuso estis mortigitaj du personoj per
kontraaviadila mitralo de kalibro 12,7 mm! i pafis el distanco
de 300 metroj el la sole ebla loko, la 20-etaa transrivera
lokonstruao. Neperceptebla kruelao! Neimagebla terorismo
kontra civiluloj en urba atobuso!<P>
La nomojn de la viktimoj mi ne memoras. La komento de mia kolego
temis pri bone konata mezlerneja profesorino, emerita sarajeva
judino. La sinjoro estis anka emerita alta tatoficisto,
sarajeva serbo.<P>
En la agadgrupo ``Savu homecon'' mi kolektis kaj legis centojn da
deklaroj de atestantoj pri krimaoj, buadoj, malhomaoj.
Terurita pro i-tiomo mi simple ne havis la forton prilabori la
viditan krimon kaj dokumenti in. Sed mi sentis mian moralan
devon ne forgesi in kaj almena iam publikigi, ke mi estas
atestanto de tiu kruela mortigo, la unua, kiun mi spertis en la
milito.<P>

<H3>EKSTERTERULOJ</H3>
<H2><I>ET-a historio</I></H2>
Lastatempe Glenn Campbell, usona esploranto pri nifoj (neidentigitaj
flugantaj objektoj), anoncis, ke li malkovris atestaojn pri
la idento de la vojaantoj de interspacaj veturiloj konataj kiel
flugantaj teleroj. Li nun okupias pri kolektado de donitaoj
rilatantaj al unu eksterterulo (ET), kiu supoze rolas aktuale
kiel konsilanto al ekstreme sekreta altnivela instanco de la usona
registaro por instrui pri konstruado de praktike funkcianta fluganta
telero.<P>
Tiu ekstertera estulo, kies nomo estas Jarod, havas grizan haton
kaj kvar fingrojn sur iu mano. Campbell eksciis, ke la denaska
lingvo de la eksterterulo estas pli alte evoluinta formo de la hungara.
Kiam Jarod parolas, i havas la kutimon konstrui siajn anglalingvajn
frazojn la la hungara vortordo. La fonto de la informoj, kiujn
Campbell ricevis, reliefigis, ke tio estas oportuna, ar la hungara
estas la speciala kodlingvo de la supersekreta esplorprojekto.
Cetere, oni diras, ke la projekto dungas hungarajn scienculojn
prefere al tiuj de iuj aliaj naciecoj.<P>
Se Glenn Campbell sukcesos apogi siajn asertojn per objektivaj
faktoj pri la lingvo de Jarod, eble farios akceptebla lia hipotezo,
ke la hungara estas la gepatra lingvo de alimondaj vizitantoj
al la tero. Sekve, estos necese respondi la sekvajn demandojn.
u la unuaj hungaroj estis fremduloj el alia astro? u hungaroj
estis la veturantoj en la unuaj flugantaj teleroj, kiuj atingis
la teron?<P>
Nifomaniuloj hodia havas la taskon alproprigi rudimentojn de
la hungara lingvo por testi la hipotezon de Campbell. Ekzemple,
la sekvan fojon, kiam surterias fluganta telero kaj elvenas
fremdulo renkonte la vi, alparolu tiun estulon per jena mallonga
frazo: ``ET menj haza!'' (hungare: ET iru hejmen!) kaj atendu la
rezulton de tiu kontakto. A la ET tuj malaperos a i agrese
malaperigos vin!<P>

<H3>HISTORIO</H3>
<H2><I>Ludtereno por infanoj</I></H2>
Inter la 8a kaj 14a de septembro okazis en Forl&iacute;, Italio, la
13a Kongreso de la Internacia Unio de Prehistoriaj kaj Protohistoriaj
Sciencoj. Dum fakuloj askultis prelegojn, estis aranita programo
nomata ``Anta la historio'' por infanoj inter la aoj de 12 monatoj
kaj 10 jaroj.<P>
La infanoj ricevis instruon pri la vivmaniero de siaj prauloj
en la formo de ``laboratorioj'', kie ili lernis kiel spliti kaj
tajli tonon, fari fajron, dekori murojn per tonetoj kaj ligno,
baki ceramikaojn, fari kolenojn el konkoj, uzi materialojn
por teksi, mueli farunon, kuiri ``primitivan'' pladon kaj prilabori
metalojn.<P>
Tiuj agadoj servas por doni instruivan bildon pri diversaj aspektoj
de prehistoria mastrumado kaj metiaj laboroj, kaj samtempe disvolvas
manlertecon e la infanoj.<P>
i-speca ludterena kontaktigo de infanoj kun vivmanieroj de la
pasinteco ne estas unikao de la itala kongreso de prehistoriistoj.
Anta pli-malpli tridek jaroj estis rekonstruitaj en Leyre, Danlando,
pluraj prehistoriaj domoj, en kiuj gejunuloj lois. Anka en
la 1980-aj jaroj estis organizitaj semajnfinaj ``ekskursoj en la
pasintecon'' por vienaj lernejanoj.<P>
i-spece tridimensia, rekta kontakto inter hodiaaj homoj kaj
materialoj de la pasinteco estas bona didaktika maniero kompletigi
lernolibrajn historiajn lecionojn.<P>

<H3>SPAC-ESPLORO</H3>
<H2><I>Lun-atikaj fotoj</I></H2>
Anta nelonge aperis libro en Usono malkaanta trompon pri la
agado sur la luno de la Apollo-astronato Neil Armstrong [Nil
Amstrong].<P>
La la programo de la kosmoipo Apollo-11, eksperimento estis
farita en 1969 por meti homojn sur la surfacon de la luno. Raportaoj
kun fotoj en gazetoj kaj anka televiziaj dissendoj montris,
ke la 21an de julio Armstrong, la komandanto de la spacipo,
pais sur la surfaco de la luno. Fotografis kaj filmis lin lia
kolego Aldrin, la piloto de la lun-pramo. Tio neniam okazis la
la sensacia aserto de Bill Kaysing [Kesing], kiu inter 1956 kaj
1963 laboris kiel direktoro de la entrepreno, kiu fabrikis la
transmisian motor-mekanismon de la Apollo-kosmoipoj.<P>
Inter la gravaj argumentoj apogantaj la vidpunkton de Kaysing
estas la fakto, ke sur la fotografaoj montrantaj la komandanton
Armstrong, ne estas videbla e unu stelo. Krome, en la
eventoplena momento de surlunio, la lun-ato ne nur ne faris
krateron sed anka la motoro de la transportilo ne lasis spuron.
Plue, iuj ombroj sur la foto, kiujn etis la kosmonato,
neniumaniere povis rezulti de la tieaj lumcirkonstancoj.<P>
Kaysing klarigas, ke la trukitaj fotografaoj estis preparitaj
en sekreta laboratorio en la dezerto de la tato Nevado la
mendo de scenarlibreto de NASA (La Nacia Aviada kaj Spacesplora
Administracio de Usono). La celo estis certigi usonan superecon
kontra la rusoj en la malvarma milito.<BR>

<H3>SPAC-ESPLORADO</H3>
<H2><I>Sekso en la kosmo</I></H2>
Per la disvastigo de sciencaj donitaoj dum la lastaj jardekoj,
oni eksciis multon pri spacveturado sed ne, u seksaj interrilatoj
estas eblaj en la kosmo. La unua penisa erektio jam okazis
dum enkosma flugo, sed, la la scioj, ankora ne estis seksumado,
nek en kosmoveturiloj nek en spacstacioj.<P>
Pro la senpezeco estus tre riska entrepreno por astronatino naski.
La homa organismo reagas tre unusence al senpezeco. Se i ne
ricevas konvenan aradon, i sentas, ke tio ne estas necesa.
Sekve de tio, la organismo komencas malkonstrui la propran ostosistemon.
Se virino sukcesus naski en senpezaj cirkonstancoj, la infano
post reiro sur la teron fatale devus lukti kontra gravaj problemoj.<P>
Kiam estiis demando pri vidbenda kasedo, kiun kunportos hungara astronato
por montri al siaj sovetiaj kunvojaantoj, li elektis prezentadon
de bela kantistino surhavanta tre mallongan jupon. La estro de
la hungara komitato malpermesis tion, ar li timis, ke la ne
sufie dece vestita junulino skandalos la sovetianojn. Tamen,
kiam la hungaroj en Moskvo spektis la filmon, kiun preparis la
sovetianoj, ili surpriziis, ar i estis tia pornografia filmo, kian
ili ankora ne vidis en sia vivo. Responde al la demando, kial
estis elektita tiu filmo, la rusoj tute nature klarigis, ke efektive
estas necese memorigi, ke ili havas certajn organojn, kiujn ili
devos uzi, kiam ili reiros sur la teron.<P>

u ``ne!'' al mortpuno?</H3>
La prezidanto de Litovio, Algirdas Brazauskas, liveros al la parlamento
(Sejmo) dekreton pri haltigo de ekzekutoj de mortkondamnitoj.
La prezidanto emfazis, ke li agas la principoj de humaneco,
strebante akceli la integrion de Litovio al Eropo kaj konsiderante
la vidpunkton de la pli multaj eropaj tatoj pri mortpuno. En sesioj
de la Parlamenta Asembleo de la Eropa Konsilio oni konstante riproas
Litovion, Rusion kaj Ukrainion pro la plenumo de mortpuno en tiuj
landoj.
<P>
La dekreto estos la unua etapo de abolicio de leo pri mortpuno.
Poste sekvus neaplikado de mortverdiktoj kaj la lasta pao -
forigo de la koncerna artikolo el la kriminala learo.
<P>
De post la deklaro de sendependio en Litovio en 1990, oni mortpafis
7 kondamnitojn. Nuntempe en Litovio estas 9 malliberuloj,
kiuj atendas ekzekuton. La lasta mortverdikto estis plenumita
en 1995. En junio 1995 la prezidanto rifuzis petskribojn pri
punmildigo de du kondamnitoj al la morto.
<P>
Oni povas prognozi, ke oni en Litovio ne favore akceptos la
iniciaton de la tatestro. Rezultoj de lastaj sociologiaj esploroj
montras, ke 75 % de la loantaro esprimis sin por mortpuno kaj nur
15 % kontra. Verajne, konante la popolan opinion kaj
pensante pri la okazontaj parlamentaj balotoj, la
politikistoj - frakciestroj en Sejmo, parti-gvidantoj
- ne rapidas decide subteni la prezidanton. Multaj argumentas,
ke forigi la mortpunon estus antatempe: estas alta la grado de krimeco en
la lando kaj sen mortpuno i plialtius; forigo de la mortpuno
postulus grandajn elspezojn; la jura sistemo ankora ne estas preta;
la vivmaniero, vivkondioj, pensmaniero de la litova loantaro tre
diferencas de tiuj en okcidenteropaj landoj.
<P>
Kvankam fakuloj asertas, ke la mortpuno rimarkeble ne influas la
multecon de krimoj, tamen la plimulto de la socio tion ne kredas.
Murdoj kaj kruelaoj oftas en la hodiaa Litovio. Preska samtempe
kun informo pri la iniciato de la prezidanto, gazetoj publikigis
nekrologojn pri la morto de vilna poeto Ralmondas Jonutis.
Li estis kruele mortigita sur efstrato de la efurbo.
<P>
La kondioj en la malliberejoj estas tre malbonaj. La eloj estas
troplenigitaj. En Litovio estas 12 prizonoj kaj 2 enketadaj izolejoj.
En ili trovias 10 mil malliberuloj kaj 2 mil arestitoj. En
Svedio, kun loantaro preska 3-oble pli granda ol tiu de Litovio,
estas 70 prizonoj kaj 11 enketadaj izolejoj. En ili estas tenataj
4000 kondamnitoj kaj 800 arestitoj. La averaa puntempo en Svedio
estas 3-4 monatoj, dum en Litovio i estas 4 jaroj kaj 3 monatoj.
Tiuj donitaoj atestas pri la grado de krimeco kaj la kondioj de
malliberuloj en Litovio. Svedaj malliberuloj povas havi televidilojn,
personajn komputilojn. Kondamnitoj al ismorta mallibereco,
se ili discipline kondutas, post certa enprizona tempo rajtas
semajnfine forlasi la malliberejon. Al kondamnito estas konservata
laborloko (se li havis in) en privata a tata organizao.
Vere estas malfacile kredi tion kaj imagi, ke almena io simila
iam eblos en Litovio.
<P>
Internaciaj organizaoj neoficiale promesis financan subtenon
por plibonigo de la kondioj de kondamnitoj al longa mallibereco,
se en Litovio oni esos ekzekuti mortkondamnitojn.
<P>
En la lando ekflamis nova diskuto. iu diversmaniere interpretas
la kvinan dekalogan ordonon. u vere i estas ambigua?

<H3>BRITIO</H3>
<H2><I>Steloj, strioj kaj trajnoj</I></H2>
Kiam la brita reino Viktoria (kiu mortis en 1901) veturis per sia
aparta rea trajno, i iam - pro sekureco, pro timo - insistis
pri maksimuma rapideco de 65 km/h. Tamen i veturis, sciante, ke
- memevidente - la lokomotivo, la trajnestro kaj aliaj dungitoj
apartenas al brita kompanio.<P>
Ne plu la nuna brita reino Elizabeta 2a. Estontece, kiam i
entrajnios, i scios, ke respondecon pri la prestia kaj luksa
rea trajno transprenis la usona kompanio Nordaj kaj Sudaj Fervojoj,
parto de la konsorcio WCTC (Wisconsin Centra
Transport-Kooperativo).<P>
WCTC, kiu jam funkciigas trajn-servojn en Nov-Zelando kaj partoj
de Kanado kaj Usono, same transprenis la britajn pot-trajnojn.
Fervojistoj - nuntempe dungitaj de la nacia brita fervojo -
antavidas senlaborecon: laraporte WCTC en Usono ne enpostenigas
sindikatanojn.<P>
La dissplitio de la fervojo - en pli ol 30 apartajn kompaniojn -
akordias kun la privatiga, profito-celanta politiko de la
konservativa registaro. Tamen sursojle de privatigo ankora
mankas kaj profitoj kaj la promesita, plibonigita servo: elspeziis
centoj da milionoj da britaj pundoj, dum raportis, konsilis, kunsidis
t.n. fakuloj pri fervojaj aferoj, politikistoj kaj komercistoj;
samtempe lamis - en 1995 nulis - investado en novaj vagonoj kaj
lokomotivoj.<P>
Por ordinaraj pasaeroj - klientoj, la nova komerca klimato -
privatigo kunportas konfuzon kaj aoson. Por la reino i
kunportos ... kion? Krom eble entrajne usonan makdonalds-specan
matenmanon anstata tradician britan - lardon kaj ovojn -
sendube i kunportos honton: u ne estis la britoj, kiuj dum la
erao de Viktoria fervojojn donis al la mondo?<BR>

Gepatra painkozo</H2>
Mortis du infanoj, dum la patrino ludis painkon - furoran
vetludon por plenkreskuloj. La infanoj, lasitaj en atomobilo,
mortis pro senakvio. Tamen tiaj akcidentoj ne estas maloftaj.
<P>
Ekde la lasta aprilo okazis 30 tiaj akcidentoj, dum patro a
patrino ludis painkon. Ekzemple, en junio, unujara knabo
falis en kanaleton apud painko-ludejo.

Painko estis ludilo por knaboj anta la Dua Mondmilito. Post
la milito painko fariis vetludilo por plenauloj. Tamen
i estis tre primitiva. Oni komence aetis etonojn. Kiam
oni enmetis etonon en la painko-aparaton, globeto eliis.
Oni suprenfrapis in per levilo. Kiam la globeto eniris en
trueton inter multe da pingloj, oni gajnis dek etonojn. Oni
anis la etonojn kontra okolado a similaoj.
<P>
Paralele kun la progreso de Japanio, anka painko progresis.
Oni komencis ani globetojn kontra mono. La etonoj jam de longe
malaperis. Frapi globetojn per fingroj ne necesas. La painko-aparato
nun elektronike ekpafas globetojn. Kiam oni estas bonanca,
miloj da globetoj elfluas el la aparato.
<P>
La painko-industrio tre furoras e en la nuna stagnanta ekonomio.
Painkejoj trovias ie en la urbo. Survoje al vendejoj kaj
hejmo oni facile povas ui painkon. Oni bezonas malmulte da
mono por ekludi, sed nun virinoj kaj anka junuloj enfalas en
painkomanion kaj telas monon por ludi. Anka la mafio enplektias,
falsante painko-kartojn.

<H3>JAPANIO</H3>
<H2><I>Forlasitaj bomboj</I></H2>
Japana esplorkomisiono pri kemiaj bomboj forlasitaj en inio de
eksa japana armeo fine de la dua mondomilito publikigis, ke la
kvanto de bomboj en Jilin-provinco en norda inio estas 700&#160;000.
Tiu nombro estas pli malgranda ol la ina registaro supozas.<P>
Japanio ekinvadis inion komence de la 20a jarcento: en 1932
i starigis la landon nomatan Manurio en la norda parto de
inio. La lando estis perfekta pupo de Japanio, kiu tie povis
arbitre agadi. Tie i garnizonigis la fifaman trupon n-ro&#160;731,
kiu sekrete studis la bakterian militon, vivekzamenante rusajn
kaj inajn militkaptitojn. La forlasitaj bomboj estas unu el
la evidentaoj de la japanarmeaj malhumanaj agadoj.<P>
La esploro farita de la ina registaro, la nombro de kemiaj
armiloj forlasitaj de japana armeo en 20 lokoj en la tuta inio
atingas du milionojn; plue pli ol 2000 homoj suferas de veneno eliinta
de la kemiaj bomboj. Al la demando, kial la nombro estas ege malsama,
la japana komisiono respondis, ke la ina kalkulo bazias sur malnova
informo el la 1950aj jaroj. La komisiono konstatas, ke estos
tre malfacile detrui la bombojn. La japana registaro planas esplori
en aliaj lokoj kaj tie konstrui purigajn staciojn.<P>

<H2><I>Knabino perfortita<BR>
de usonaj soldatoj</I></H3>
La vesperon de la 4a de septembro elementan lernejaninon  sekse
perfortis tri usonaj soldatoj. La japana polico tuj postulis de
la usona armeo en Okinawa, kie okazis la atako, ke i transdonu
la suspektatojn al la polico, sed i rifuzis. Do la polico devis
viziti la usonan militistejon por esplordemandi ilin.<P>
Danke al pakto inter Japanio kaj Usono, tiu ne devas transdoni
suspektatojn al la japana polico, e se la krimo okazis ekster la
militistejo, t.e. en japana teritorio. Lapakte, kiam suspektatoj
estas en la manoj de Usono, i tiu enkarcerigas ilin, is la
prokurora akuzo komencios.<P>
Post la dua mondmilito Usono ekokupis la Okinawa-insulon. En 1972
i tiu reunuiis kun Japanio. La okinavanoj esperis, ke Okinawa
ius libera de usona regado, sed la situacio ne aniis. Dare
ekzistas en Okinawa 70 elcentoj de la usonaj militistejoj en
Japanio. Dum pli ol dudek jaroj okazis 12 mortigoj kaj pli ol
4600 aliaj krimoj faritaj de usonaj soldatoj. Soldatoj sin
ekzercadas, blokante stratojn. Bomboj flugas super domoj kaj
lernejoj.<P>
Post la seksperfortado, grandskalaj protestadoj okazis. La
guberniestro de Okinawa rifuzis subskribi la proceduron, kiu
permesas al la usona armeo disponi terenojn kontra la volo de
ties posedantoj. En diversaj lokoj oni organizas kunsidojn. Urba
kaj gubernia asembleoj rezoluciis kontra la malegala pakto inter
Japanio kaj Usono. Oni e ekdiskutis la nuligon de la traktato
inter Japanio kaj Usono, la kiu la usona armeo rajtas garnizoni
en Japanio.<P>
Ju pli Japanio riias, des pli Usono postulas pagon: la japana
registaro ``afable'' konstruis ne nur instalaojn, sed anka
luksajn domojn por soldato-familioj. Por japanoj estas ne
tolereble, ke la soldatoj, kiujn oni finance subtenas, suferigas
la popolon. La japana kaj usona registaroj surprizias pri la
reago kaj klopodas mildigi la koleregon, sed tio estas tre
malfacila tasko.<P>

<BODY>
<H3>OPINIO</H3>
<H2>u toreado - a torearto?</H2>
En MONATO disfoje aperas artikoloj pri taroludoj a, por uzi pli
precizan terminon, toreado (hispane: <I>tauromaquia, lidia,
toros</I>). Kutime la artikoloj ne informas pri, sed batalas
kontra tiu mondfama hispana spektaklo. Mi deziras prezenti nun
kelkajn impresojn pri toreado (ne nepre miajn proprajn), por
montri, ke eblas rigardi in de aliaj anguloj, kaj ke la afero ne
estas tiel simpla. Fakte mi estas nek fakulo nek amatoro (mi
neniam spektis in surloke, nur televide), sed nur hispano ofte
vojainta kaj nun loanta eksterlande, kiu ofte devis diskuti pri
i kvaza nome de iuj hispanoj iamaj kaj nunaj.<P>
Kiam iu demandas min pri la temo, mi respondas, ke 50 % de la hispana
loantaro favoras toreadon, 50 % kontraas in kaj pliaj 50 % <I>ne
scias a ne respondas.</I> Jes, 150 % entute! Efektive: same en
urboj kiel en kamparaj regionoj, inter homoj junaj, maturaj a
oldaj, kleraj a senedukaj, inoj kaj malinoj, ie en Hispanio
troveblas favorantoj kaj kontraantoj de la t.n. <I>nacia
festo</I>. Krome, en multaj homoj, ekzemple en mi mem, reaperas
la sama proporcio: parte mi estas<I> por </I>i, parte
<I>malpor,</I> parte mi dubas, mi hezitas. 50 % + 50 % + 50 %!
Prefere oni ne penu trovi en tio ian logikon!<P>
Toreado ja estas kruela tradicio, sed kruelo mem ne estas ia
celo. Oni iras al toreejo (hisp.<I> plaza de toros</I>) ne por
spekti beston suferi kaj sangi, kvankam certe oni povas vidi
anka tion (televide multe pli klare kaj detale ol surloke). Oni
iras tien ne por vidi la lertecon a heroaon de toreisto (hisp.
<I>torero)</I>: toreejo ne estas cirko-tendo. Torei postulas
teknikon kaj lerton, sed toreistoj ne devas superi ian ajn
rekordon (krom stranguloj kiel la skandalema Jesuln de Ubrique,
kies rekordo konsistas el kolektado de kalsonetoj de la miloj da
spektantinoj).<P>
La publiko iras al toreejo por vidi figurojn kaj formojn;
kolorojn, bildojn, movojn. Toreado similas dancon pli ol ion
alian. Alivorte, temas pri plastika arto, nome torearto. A ni
diru, ke la publiko opinias in arto, almena teorie, ar tre
ofte toreistoj ne sukcesas transformi sian agon a faron en
(plastikan) artaon.<P>
Toreado estas nek ludo, nek sporto, nek nur spektaklo el formoj,
sed anka serioza ceremonio por vivo kaj morto, cetere kun praaj
religiaj radikoj, pro kiuj eblas kompari in kun la grekaj
tragedioj, kiel diversaj fakuloj faras.<P>
La toreata taro (krom tre esceptaj esceptoj) iam suferas kaj
mortas. La toreisto - multe pli malofte, sed la renversoj kaj
kornopikoj a kornadoj ne virtualas a ritualas, sed realas
plene, kelkfoje mortige. Fakte toreado estas unu el la profesioj a
metioj kun pli multe da streso. Oni permesu nun al mi
neakceptindan komparon. Nu, dum toreisto devas suferi en iu
toreo (hisp.<I> corrida</I> de sia kariero, taro suferas ``nur''
dum 15 a 20 minutoj, post kelkaj jaroj da bukolika vivo sur
patejoj andaluzaj a ekstremaduraj (vera paradizo kompare kun
la vivejoj de bovinoj, bredataj por la viand-industrio, a de
hejmaj hundoj en grandaj urboj).<P>
Probable toreadon origine koncernas anka la ritoj pri vireco a
virio, kvankam nuntempe toreistoj (kiel papoj, kardinaloj kaj
episkopoj) vestas sin per vestoj surprize ineskaj.<P>
Mi ne opinias, ke malpermesi toreadon estus solvo taga por iu
ajn. Neniam mi spertis la ofte ladatan toreejan etoson, sed mi
ja scias, ke la lingvo kaj kulturo de hispanoj plenas je esprimoj
kaj konceptoj el la torea mondo (vaste uzataj en medioj ekzemple
politika, sporta, ktp). Ekzistas amaso da argumentoj same por
kiel kontra tiu i (mal)arto. Eblas renkonti e ekologiemajn
portoreulojn asertantajn, ke sen toreado la hispana torea taro
definitive estingius.<P>
Ju pli oni provas malpermesi tradicion de ekstere, des pli i
fortias. Tial mi supozas, ke la estonteco de toreado dependas de
evoluo de sintenoj pro la influo de edukiteco kaj klereco en la
hispana socio. Bedarinde ajnas, ke probable politikistoj
trovas in utila kiel nova versio de la romia<I> panon kaj cirkon.</I><P>

<H3>RUSIO</H3>
<H2><I>Pacaj submaripoj</I></H2>
Lastatempe oni multe skribas kaj parolas en Rusio pri problemoj
de la transiro de milita al paca industrio. En la armeo oni reduktas
la kvanton de tankoj, aviadiloj, ipoj kaj aliaj armiloj. Ekzemple
la norda floto ``elvicigis'' dekojn da militipoj, inter ili submaripojn.
Pro tio laniis projekto por transporti per submaripoj arojn
al la bordoj de Siberio, Kamatko, Kanado kaj e Usono tra
Arkta Oceano. En Severodvinsk oni jam komencis reekipi kaj modernigi
du submaripojn. Post ses monatoj ili pretos okazigi komercajn
vojaojn kaj transporti is 15 milojn da tunoj de diversaj aroj,
likvaj kaj malmolaj. Oni opinias, ke la modernigitaj submaripoj
povus ii universala transport-rimedo en Arkto. Komence de
septembro 1995 unu el la militaj submaripoj liveris sep tunojn
da produktoj al la geologia esplora ekspedicio kaj laboristoj
de nafta kaj gasa instalaoj sur la duon-insulo Jamal.<P>

<H3>PORTUGALIO</H3>
<H2><I>Oport-una kontrolado</I></H2>
Analizinte portovinon enboteligitan en Belgio, Francio kaj
Nederlando, la portugala Portovina Instituto - respondeca pri la
kvalito de la vino - trovis, ke laenhave 69 % de la specimenoj
kontrolitaj ne konformis al la oficiale akceptebla ``Oporta Vino''.
Kvankam ne estas klara, u la falsadon entreprenis portugalaj
eksportistoj a eksterlandaj importistoj, la portugala registaro
decidis en oktobro esigi is julio venontjare pograndan
eksportadon de portovino. Intertempe internaciaj vendoj limios
al varoj enboteligitaj en Portugalio kaj kontrolitaj de la
Portovina Instituto.<P>
Tiel la registaro esperas malebligi la falsadon sen tute
malpermesi pograndan eksportadon, kio kontraus la
liberkonkurencajn regulojn de la Roma Traktato. Simila estis la
situacio koncerne la hispanan vinon <I>La Rioja</B></U></I>: post sammotiva
malpermeso, importistoj kaj eksportistoj plendis pri la
senutiligo de investoj en enbotelig-fabrikoj.<P>
Malgra sia nomo, portovino ne produktias en la norda urbo
Oporto, sed en la montara regiono Duero, kelkcent kilometrojn
oriente. Tiu i vino, tre dola, estas tutmonde populara en sia
rua formo, sed ekzistas anka blanka. in diskonigis tutmonde
efe angloj, komence de la 19a jc., kaj tial hodia multaj
atentike portugalaj portovinaj markoj portas anglalingvajn
nomojn.<P>

<H2><I>Mitoj pri militoj</I></H2>
Stefan Maul sub la supra titolo (la sia vidpunkto) asertas, ke
``ne estas mito, sed historiaj faktoj, ke sen iu ajn dubo Serbio,
pli uste la tiama komunista partio kaj ia ``popolarmeo'' estis
agresinto en Slovenio, en Kroatio kaj en Bosnio-Hercegovino''.<P>
Tio, la Maul, devas nuligi ``la kalumniojn'' kontra Germanio
pri nova germana imperiismo.<P>
Tiuj asertoj estas ``mitoj'' naskiintaj en la artikoloj de germanaj
kaj aliaj okcidentaj urnalistoj, neniel historiaj faktoj. Post
la dua mondmilito ajnis, ke Germanio forlasis la ideon pri imperiemo
super Jugoslavio. Multaj aferoj estis kaitaj, sed kiam la
kroatoj insistis, ke la kroato Stipe Mesi fariu la prezidanto
de Jugoslavio, Germanio forte subtenis tiun ideon.<P>
Mesi publike deklaris, ke li deziras esti prezidanto por detrui
Jugoslavion, kaj ke li estos ia lasta prezidanto. La subteno
de Mesi fare de Germanio pruvas, ke Germanio estis kontra Jugoslavio.
Tio estas pruvo pri ia imperiemo! La nuna prezidanto de Kroatio,
Tuman, ricevis grandan helpon de Germanio pri la detruado
de Jugoslavio, kaj la krono de tiu ago estis la tro frua agnosko
de Kroatio kaj Slovenio.<P>
Kiel Jugoslavio povis agresi kontra Slovenio kaj Kroatio, kiam
ili ankora estis partoj de Jugoslavio? Kiel povas agresi armeo,
kiu plenumas sian konstitucian devon defendi la tutan teritorion
de Jugoslavio? u agresintoj estas la britoj en Norda Irlando,
la hispanoj en Eskio, ktp?<P>
Ne estas vero, ke ``tiama jugoslavia popola armeo (kies oficiroj
estas preska senescepte serboj) atakis ...'' Se plejparto de
la oficiroj estis serboj, de kie nun venis generaloj kaj altrangaj
oficiroj al Kroatio, Slovenio, Bosnio-Hercegovino? Tiuj generaloj
ankora hodia vivas kaj ili estis oficiroj de tiu iama popola
armeo. Jen vero kaj pruvo, ke Maul ankora vivas en mitoj pri
la nuna milito en Jugoslavio.<P>
Kvankam Maul asertas, ke la celo de lia artikolo ne estas defendi
Germanion, la faktoj pruvas la malon.<P>

<H2><I>Pli da arbo-faligo en Laponio?</I></H2>
Oficiala laborgrupo proponis, ke oni permesu pliigon de
arbo-faligado en Laponio (norda Finnlando) je pli ol 10
procentoj. La la laborgrupo, la pliigo de arbo-rikolto donus
1&#160;000 - 2&#160;000 novajn labor-postenojn, kiuj estas tre bezonataj en
Laponio.<P>
eestis en la laborgrupo anoj de la ministrejo pri terkulturado,
la administrejo de tataj arbaroj kaj de diversaj laponaj
interes-grupoj. La laborgrupo ne volas pliigi la areon de la jam
grandaj naturprotektejoj en Laponio, sed protektus la nordajn
arbarojn per pli bona ekologia planado kaj per novaj normoj de
arbar-prizorgado.<P>
Reprezentantoj de la media ministrejo kaj la reprezentantoj de la
finna naturprotekta asocio malaprobis la raporton. La ili, la
laborgrupo atentis nur pri la interesoj de la industrio. La
propono de la laborgrupo altigi jaran lignoproduktadon en Laponio
de 3,9 milionoj da kubaj metroj al 4,5 milionoj da kubaj metroj,
estas nerealisma kaj ekologie netaga.<BR>

<H2><I>Germanio cenzuras<BR>
nederlandajn informojn</I></H2>
Pro minacoj de la germana registaro, la Interret-liverantoj en
Germanio blokis la nederlandan liveranton ``Access for All'' (Aliro
por iu). Tio signifas, ke neniu loanto de Germanio plu povos
per Interreto konsulti la informojn, kiuj trovias sur la servilo
de <I>Access for All.</I><P>
La germana registaro postulis tion i, ar<I> Access for All</I>
gastigas informpaon de maldekstrula organizao, kio estas tute
lalea en Nederlando, sed malpermesita en Germanio. Sekve de tiu
i agado, iuj informpaoj de la nederlanda liveranto, anka la
pluraj miloj, kiuj neniel rilatas al politiko, estas nun ne plu
legeblaj por germanaj Interret-uzantoj.<P>
Interret-liverantoj en Nederlando, sed anka en pluraj aliaj
tatoj, ekzemple en Britio, Francio, Italio, Kanado kaj Usono,
jam plendis e la germana ambasado de sia lando kaj protestis pro
tiu i formo de cenzurado. Germanio efektive en 1973 subskribis
la Internacian Interkonsenton pri Civilaj kaj Politikaj Rajtoj,
la kiu cenzurado estas kontralea.<P>
La estraro de <I>Access for All</I> deklaris al la nederlanda polico, ke
ili volonte helpos identigi personojn, kiuj uzas Interreton por
krimaj celoj, sed ke ili dare subtenos liberan esprimon de
opinioj tra la reto.<P>

<H3>BHARATO</H3>
<H2><I>Kiam dioj lakton trinkis</I></H2>
La kutime sangosoifaj dioj de la hinduaj mitoj lastatempe soifis
je lakto. En la lasta semajno de septembro raportiis, ke dioj
hinduaj, ekz. la elefantorostra Ganeo kaj ties asketa patro
ivao, trinkas lakton. Miloj da homoj - kreduloj kaj skeptikuloj
--- amasiis e temploj. Ne nur en Bharato: danke al la ``monda
vilao'' kaj al la telekomunika revolucio hinduaj temploj ie
vidis fenomenon similan.<P>
Dume la tato reagis per atendata racieco. Oni formis komitatojn
de profesiaj senmisteriguloj kiel sciencistoj, prezentistoj de
sciencaj programoj, e prestidigitistoj! Tiuj i provis televide
eliri la ``indienojn'' el la fiaj, primitivaj superstioj, kiuj
hontigis samlandanojn modernajn. Preska iu hindua mezklasa
kuirejo (kie la dioj kutime statuas) iis laboratorio - areno por
batali per racio kontra superstio.<P>
Kompreneble, neniu triumfis. Sed mallonge malabundis lakto en la
lando. La unutaga miro pasis, kaj alia spektaklo prenis ian
lokon. Jen jarmil-finaj ekscitoj komencias.<P>

<H2><I>Kien la inoj?</I></H2>
Malaperis 28 litovaj fralinoj kaj virinoj inter la ao de 16
kaj 35, la grupo, kiu seras malaperintojn. La nomoj de la
virinoj, kaj aliaj detaloj, transdoniis al nederlanda fonduso
kontra komercado per virinoj.<P>
Aktuale la fonduso zorgas pri 23 fralinoj el Litovio. La litova
grupo esperas, ke eble unu el tiuj protektatoj rekonos samsortanon
por ke la gepatroj eksciu, en kiu lando ilia filino reaperis.<P>
Tipaj ekzemploj de malaperoj. Fralino el Vilnius malaperis
kun sia 17-jaraa amikino. Ili amba iris al dancejo. Venis
luksa rua atomobilo, amba amikinoj ensidiis, kaj ekde tiam
neniu ilin plu vidis.<P>
Alia 16-jarulino diris, ke vespere i festos ies naskitagon.
Iu telefonis al i, demandis ian adreson kaj diris, ke oni
alvenos por kunpreni. ``Jam venis por mi'', diris la junulino,
kiam i ekadis sonorilon, kaj foriris. Ekde tiam neniu vidis
in.<P>
Kredeble kelkaj el la malaperintoj apartenas al malstabilaj familioj
a estas de malalta intelekto. Venintaj al granda urbo, ili
facile ekkredas, ke sinjoro kun luksa ato, kaj belaspekta, estas
ia atendata princo. Poste estas facile timigi fralinojn,
minacante pri malkovro de kompromitantaj fotoj kaj klarigante,
ke polico kunagas kun mafiuloj. Tiaj fralinoj senprobleme konvinkias
ke, aperinte en fremda lando, ili povos labori kiel infanvartistinoj,
en kafejoj, kaj finfine tie edzinii. Poste tamen ili eklaboras
kiel prostituitinoj. Aktivulinoj de la litova grupo pri serado
de malaperintoj kredas, ke la inoj estas viktimoj de organizita
krimeco.<P>
La grupanoj kredas, ke ilia agado estus pli sukcesa, se ili povus
oficiale registri apogcentron por familioj, kies filinoj malaperis.
Tiam fralinoj, liberiinte kaj reveninte, kuraus konfidi al
grupanoj tion, kion ili ne konfidus al la polico. Iliaj rakontoj
multe helpus trovi organizaojn komercantajn per inoj.<P>

<H2><I>Mitoj pri milito (2)</I></H2>
Interesis min la artikolo de Stefan Maul ``Mito pri militoj''. Unue
Maul kredigas al ni, ke li ne volas defendi Germanion, sed nur
prezenti la veron: tamen en lia artikolo aperis kelkaj neveroj ne
pro malbona atora intenco, sed pro malbona informo.<P>
Evidente, Maul ne legis la ``Memorandon de Serba Akademio de
Sciencoj kaj Artoj''; li ne povus aserti, ke tiu skribao emfazas
la ideon pri ``Granda Serbio'' kaj ke i enhavas mapojn kiel
disdividi Jugoslavion favore al ``Granda Serbio''. Nenie aperas la
termino ``Granda Serbio'' kaj ekzistas neniu kaj nenia mapo. La
teksto kritikas la situacion en la tiama Jugoslavio, ekz.
ekonomion kaj unupartian sistemon. Nur fine de la verko la
atoroj insistas pri la egalrajto de la federaciaj tatoj inter
kiuj, dum aliaj ekonomie progresas, Serbio malprogresas. u estas
konate ke ekz. estis malpermesite en Serbio konstruigi fabrikon
de juveloj, kvankam nur en Serbio oni elfosadis oron? La oro
estis sendata al Slovenio, kie i estis transformata en juvelojn,
kaj tiam sendata al Serbio kaj aliaj landoj (anka al
eksterlando) por vendado. u estas konate, ke Serbio, danke al
siaj vastaj kaj fruktodonaj ebenaoj, estis la plej granda
produktanto de nutraoj kaj Slovenio la plej granda eksportanto
de nutrao? e la fino de la Memorando trovias jena frazo: ``Unu
epoko de jugoslava unuio, kaj Serbio finis in per historie
eluzita ideologio, per enerala stagno kaj malprogreso en
ekonomia, politika, morala, kulturciviliza sferoj. Tiu situacio
nepre postulas, radikalajn, profunde pripensitajn reformojn de la
tuta socia organizo de jugoslava unuio de la popoloj en la sfero
de demokrata socialismo'' ... u tiu teksto insistas pri ``Granda
Serbio''? Fine tiu ``Memorando'' tute ne estas definitiva akto, nur
malneto de kelkaj akademianoj.<P>
Maul anka asertas, ke la plimulto de la oficiroj en la jugoslava
armeo estis serboj. Tio estas vero. Sed u en la franca armeo
eskoj estas plimulto? u en la brita skotoj estas plimulto? u
en la eksa sovetia rua armeo plimulto estis kirgizoj, estonoj,
eenoj ...? Estas tute kompreneble, ke la plimulto en iu armeo
estas anoj de la pli multnombra popolo. El la 22 milionoj da
loantoj de la eksa Jugoslavio pli ol duono estis serboj, la alia
duono estis kompletigita el la apartenantoj de la kvin aliaj
respublikoj.<P>
En tiu tempo, pri kiu parolas Maul, la gvidantoj de la armeo
estis ne nur serboj sed anoj de iuj popoloj. La komandanto de la
aerarmeo estis generalo Tus (kroato), la komandanto de la
mararmeo admiralo Brovet (sloveno), la efestro de la jugoslava
efstabo generalo Bobetko (kroato), ministro de Nacia Defendo
generalo Kadijevi (duonkroato-serbo). La la konstitucio, la
efkomandanto de la tuta armeo estis la prezidantaro de
Jugoslavio kies prezidanto estis Stipe Mesi (kroato), kiu jam
kiel kandidato por la prezidanteco publike multfoje deklaris, ke
li malkonstruos Jugoslavion.<P>
Maul asertas anka, ke tiam Kroatio estis preska sen armiloj. u
vere? Sed Maul certe ne vidis filmon faritan e la limo de
Kroatio, pri la importo de grandaj kvantoj da armiloj.<P>
Fine, la nuna prezidanto de Serbio ne nomias Slbadan, sed
Slobodan.<P>

<H2>Atenco kontra fundamenta rajto</H2>
Ne estas io nova konstati, ke tato ne plenumas la homajn rajtojn,
sed se tiu tato estas Usono kaj la maniero elektata estas per
leo, tio jam estas pli grava.<P>
iu povas supozi, ke mi skribas pri la usona leo Helms-Burton,
kiu malpermesas al aliaj tatoj komerci kun Kubo. Sciate estas,
ke iu sendependa tato estas suverena kaj rajtas decidi kun
kiu komerci, kun kiu havi rilatojn a kun kiu subskribi traktatojn.
Do, la suvereneco estas io esenca kaj, ekde la klasika doktrino
de la internacia juro (tiutempe intergenta juro), fundamenta rajto
de la tatoj, kiun neniu povas nei. Tio estas tiel grava, ke
sen suvereneco mankas unu el la bazaj elementoj por esti subjekto
de la internacia juro, kaj, por partopreni en la internacia komunumo,
ekzemple, esti membro de Unuiintaj Nacioj (UN).<P>
La plej antikva agnoskata patro de la internacia juro, la hispana
Francisko de Vitoria, jam proklamis al la mondo, ekde lia katedro
en Salamanka, en la 16a jarcento, la komunikadrajton, kiel naturrajton
de iu popolo. Tiu rajto estas konsekvenco de la homa solidareco.
Vitoria iras pli malproksimen en sia pensado, dirante, ke ``se
iu popolo malfaciligas tiun rajton al alia, li ignoras la naturjuron
kaj oni rajtas fari justan militon kontra li ...''. Temis pri
la ideo de justa milito, defendata dum jarcentoj. De la komunikadrajto,
Vitoria devenigas du aliajn naturrajtojn: tiun pri la libera navigado
kaj tiun pri la libera komerco. Tiuj estis defendataj, dum sekvintaj
jarcentoj, de Menaka, Grotius, Gentili, Vives, ktp.. Preterlasante
tiujn klasikulojn, la rajto pri libera komerco restis is la
19a jarcento kiel libervolo de la tatoj, tiel ke, se iu rifuzis
interrilati kun aliaj, tiu konduto ne povis esti interpretata
kiel kontrajura, sed kiel konsekvenco de ia suvereneco.<P>
Dum la 19a jarcento, la okcidentaj potencoj proklamis la principojn
pri ``malfermitaj pordoj''. Per tiu tezo la industriaj tatoj,
eropaj unue kaj Usono poste, sekuriis merkatojn por siaj
varoj. Tiel oni premis Azion, kaj sub politika kaj milita premo
tiu principo altrudiis al inio kaj Japanio kiel jurregulo.
Sed dum la dua duono de la pasinta jarcento, la ideoj aniis.
Reaperis nocio pri solidareco kaj interdependeco, kaj oni diskutis
pri la rajto al izoliteco. tato rajtas komerci a ne, sed neniu
rajtas trudi nekomercadon al alia.<P>
Manifestacio pli aktuala de tiu suverena rajto trovias en la
solena deklaracio de UN (Rezolucio 2625) pri ``principoj de internacia
juro pri la rilatoj de amikeco kaj kunlaboro inter la tatoj,
la la arto de la Unuiintaj Nacioj''. ia celo ne estas
alia ol teni kaj fortikigi la internacian pacon fonditan sur la
libereco, egaleco kaj suvereneco, respektante iam la homajn rajtojn
kaj la akceladon al la amikaj rilatoj inter la popoloj, sendepende
de ia politika, ekonomia a socia sistemo.<P>
Pro tio multaj vooj, inter ili tiu de la Eropa Unio, leviis
kontra la apliko de tiu usona leo Helms-Burton.<P>
Se iu konsentas pri la justa reago kontra invado de teritoria
suvereneco de iu tato (ekzemple, la milito Irako-Kuvajto, la
reago de la Sekureca Konsilio de UN, kaj la posta agado de Usono kaj
aliaj tatoj por redoni suverenecon al Kuvajto), kial ne reagi
kontra atenco al alia fundamenta rajto, kiel estas la perforto
kontra libera komerco?<P>

Pli bone unu birdo en la mano</H2>
La 15an de julio okazis terura aviadilakcidento en armea
aviadilejo en Nederlando. Belga armea C-130 <I>Hercules</I> aviadilon
kolapsis
dum la surteriado. La aviadilo portis hejmen ensemblon de
nederlandaj armeaj muzikistoj. Neniu el la homoj en la aviadilo
supervivis la akcidenton.
<P>
La tujaj komentoj late ladis la lertan agadon de la nederlanda
fajrobrigado kaj helpantaro. Aliflanke, kulpon oni ovis al la
belga pilotaro. Atestanto deklaris, ke li vidis, ke la aviadilo
faris iun mallertan manovron: tiel nomata trastartado. i estas
pilota ekzerca rutino, dum kiu la piloto preska surterias kaj
tiam denove suprentiras la aviadilon. Dum tiu manovro flugilo
tuis la grundon, la aviadilo turniis, kolapsis kaj ekbrulis.
Feble adiis mesaeto pri birdoj sin trovintaj sur la surteriejo.
<P>
La belgaj armeaj atoritatoj diris, ke la piloto, kvankam juna,
estis tute sperta, kun pli da flughoroj ol bezonataj por estri
tian aviadilon. La aserto ne povis silentigi tiujn kulpigajn
voojn. Per la akcidento anka grave makuliis la belga reputacio. Fakte
ajnas, ke la belgaj pilotoj de C-130 aviadiloj estas
fame konataj por specialaj misioj en triamondaj regionoj (ekzemple
por eleti manao-helpon).
<P>
Komence de oktobro la nederlanda aer-armea estraro prezentis
raporton pri la akcidento. i centelcente rehonorigas la belgan
skipon. La aviadilon trafis svarmo da sturnoj kaj vaneloj. Kiam
unu motoro pro tio difektiis, la piloto lerte malaltis in, kaj
por eviti la birdojn komencis sian trastartadon. Tamen, preska
sammomente esis funkcii du aliaj motoroj. La lasta motoro ne
povis fari la taskon, la aviadilo malekvilibriis kaj iis
neregebla. La pilotoj post la kolapso ankora klopodis helpi
siajn pasaerojn, sed ne sukcesis malfermi de ene la pordojn.
<P>
Por la nederlandanoj la raporto estas severa: Neniu rimarkis la
birdojn. (Post la akcidento oni trovis pli ol 200 kadavrojn.)
La helpantoj alvenis preska duona horo tro malfrue, sed krome
neniu avertis ilin, ke en la aviadilo anka troviis pasaeroj. Ili pensis,
ke estis nur la pilotoj. Kun pli taga
helpo eble la homoj povus esti savitaj.
<P>
Tiuj i okazintaoj bone ilustras la rilatojn inter Belgio kaj
Nederlando. Kvankam amba landoj bone kaj amike kunvivas, dare
estas iu konkurenco: Kiu estas la plej bona? Precipe tiu
evidentias en  senkulpa  piedpilka tereno. Sed i anka
ekzistas pri tata organizado, komercado, industrio, ktp. Kaj en
i Belgio dare estas markita kiel la mallertulo. Se oni
objektive analizas iujn cirkonstancojn, tamen, Belgio ne iam
devas honti, Nederlando ne iam fanfaroni. Estas nur bedarinde,
ke en tiu i kazo la prezo je homaj vivoj estis tiel alta.

BELGIO: Tagluma komaro
</H2>
La 15an de agusto Belgio vekiis kun la plej bona novao
imagebla. Du
knabinoj, unu, kiu malaperis anta deko da tagoj, la alia
malaperinta anta kelkaj monatoj, estis retrovitaj de la polico.
Amba estis sekse perfortitaj, sed jen malgrava afero  almena
se oni juas la la komentoj en urnaloj. Plej grave estis, ke ili
vivas kaj ke la infanrabisto, Marc Dutroux [Mark Ditru'], estis
arestita.
<P>
Ho ve, nur mallonge daris anta ol tiu bela sono
aniis al plej terura komaro dum plenluma tago. Post kelkaj
tagoj evidentiis, ke du knabinoj, 8-jaraaj, estis rabitaj de la
sama viro. Sed ili ne travivis la sperton. Kiam, pro sia agado
kiel atomobiltelisto, la kulpulo estis enkarcerigita, la du
infanoj mortis ... pro malsato.
<P>
La kulpon je la malsatigo ovis tien kaj reen Dutroux. Unue li
kulpigis iun kunulon, kiu iam perfidis lin. Pro la neglekto de
la infanoj, Dutroux estus entombiginta lin viva. Tamen, nekropsio evidentigis,
ke li jam estis mortinta anta la infanoj. Tiam li kulpigis
alian kunulon. Finfine lia edzino konfesis, ke Dutroux al i
ordonis prizorgi la infanojn, sed i ne adacis eniri la kaojn,
kaj lasis la infanojn sen manao. Kiam Dutroux finis sian punon,
la infanoj estis tiel malfortaj kaj preska mortaj, ke li ne plu
povis vivigi ilin. Kaj li topis ilin en truon en sia ardeno.
<P>
Nur semajnojn post tiuj okazintaoj kaj post fosado tie kaj aliloke,
kun helpo de brita policisto kun mistera radaro; de nederlanda
militisto kun flartrafa nazo; de germanaj kadavrohundoj  kies
movioj estis de minuto al minuto precize sekvataj de la tuta
gazetaro, oni trovis la korpojn de du aliaj knabinoj, An kaj
Eefje, malaperintaj en Oostende anta unu jaro.
<H3>
Histerio
</H3>
Tiuj i abomenindaj eltrovaoj kazis veran okon kaj histeriigis
parton de la belga loantaro. Kiam oni arestis Dutroux oni devis
protekti lin kontra la publika frenezo. Homoj hurlis, insultis
kaj e volis tuj lini la viron. Sed samtempe oni anka
kulpigis la justicon kaj la tiaman ministron pri justico, Melchior
Wathelet [atele'], kiu liberigis tiun saman Dutroux post lia puno pro
seksperfortado. Latvoe oni postulis la neniigon de leo
kiu
ebligas mallongigon de karcerpuno. E adiis postuloj
re-enkonduki mortpunon, nur anta nelonge nuligita en Belgio.
Sed okazis anka aliaj ekscesoj. Krimuloj enkarcerigitaj, post
sia iutaga promenado rifuzis reiri al siaj karceroj sed postulis
ricevi gazetaran konferencon, en kiu ili povus publike kondamni tiun
aan ulon... pri la propraj misagoj neniu vorto.
<P>
Malgranda vilao tuj post la faktoj, iis centro de la mondo.
Miloj da homoj turismumis tien por nur povi videti iun kulpulon,
policanon a pecon de la krimloko. La tuta belga amaskomunikilaro,
plifortigita de siaj internaciaj kolegoj, dum semajno
tendumis tie. La televida urnalo, la gazetoj prikantis nur unu
temon ... kaj iuj dancis en la koto, same la rekta signifo, ar
pluvegis dum tiuj tagoj, kiel metafore.
<P>
Tiom ekscesa estis la publika reago, ke pluraj instancoj  inter
kiu anka la belga efepiskopo, Godfried Danneels [Gotfrit
Danels'] kaj la Organizao por la Defendo de Homaj Rajtoj 
alvokis al pli da sereneco. Kaj tio ja necesis. Dutroux dum tagoj
e ne trovis advokaton. Finfine la kortumo lalee indikis iun.
Tiu intertempe ricevis mortminacojn, kaj same okazis al Connerotte,
la enket-juisto kiu esploris la aferon.
<P>
Serene sintenis la familioj de la viktimoj. Kvankam la gepatroj de Julie
kaj Melissa (la etaj knabinoj) dum la entombigo-ceremonio rifuzis
tagan lokon al la reprezentanto de la reo  kiu pro tio ne
eestis , ili iuj montris ne nur doloregon, sed anka emon al
pardono. Akre ili ja kulpigis la fiaskantan justicon.
<H3>
La kulpuloj
</H3>
Kompreneble, neniu dubas pri la rekta kulpo de Dutroux kaj liaj
kunuloj. Sed anka aliaj grave misplenumis siajn taskojn. Polico
traseris la domon, kie kaptiis la du infanoj. Sed kiam ili adis
plorantajn infanojn, ili akceptis la klarigon, ke temis pri propraj
infanoj, kaj ne enketis pli profunde.
<P>
Same, la polico en iuj okazoj  krom la lasta  tro malfrue
eklaboris, forsendante la timigitajn gepatrojn per klarigoj, ke
verajne temas pri forkurintaj infanoj, kiuj ja de si mem
revenos. Anka la kunlaborado de la diversaj
polico-departementoj tute lamis kaj la interna informado kaj la
informado al la enket-juistoj estis tute fuaj. Kaj en la
plej funda fundo  se decas paroli pri fundoj i tie  dare
adias flustroj, ke Dutroux ie havas alta(j)n protektanto(j)n ... a
eble alta(j)n kompromitinto(j)n.
<H3>
Politikaj konsekvencoj
</H3>
Unu bona sekvo ajnas esti, ke la tuta juista kaj polica aparato
vekiis. Subite antaeniras la enketo pri la mortigo de ministro Andr
Cools [Andre' Kols], mortigita en 1991. Tamen, la enketistoj
neas,  ke estas iu
rekta rilato inter tiu kazo kaj la Dutroux-afero. Instaliis
enketo-komisionoj, kiuj devas esplori la agadon de la justico, kaj
ili ajnas atingi kelkajn sukcesojn: efjuisto provizore rezignis
de sia posteno ar lia filo rekte a malrekte interplektiis kun
Dutroux; polico-inspektoro kaj lia superulo estas arestitaj.
<P>
Tamen, plej granda estas la lavortaj konsekvencoj. La reo, kiu
akceptis adience iujn trafitajn familiojn, publike riproas la
registaron kaj demandas profundan esploron. Li tiel verajne nur
adigas la voon de siaj gastoj. Tamen, la reo ne rajtas publike
mem paroli: do dum semajno tiu nura ago de la reo estas temo en
la gazetaraj kaj politikaj komentoj. ar, kvankam li ja pravas,
li ne rajtas fari tion, kaj do skuias la Belga Reejo sur siaj
fundamentoj.
<P>
Anka la politikistoj mem dare debatas  la parlamento e
mallongigis siajn feriojn por povi pridiskuti la aferon , komentas,
diras, ke tiaj aferoj ne plu okazu, anoncas, ke Belgio
internacie gvidos la batalon kontra la infanpornografio, postulas
isfundan klarigadon de la afero, volas ke la kulpuloj estu
punitaj.
<P>
Juista komisiono intertempe esploris la enketojn kaj konkludis,
ke ie malbone funkciis la polico, dum juistoj faris sian eblon,
sed ne ricevis la necesajn informojn. La polico kontrabatalis
kaj diris, ke ne i kulpas, sed juistoj, ar ili devas gvidi la
enketon sed fuis.
<P>
Kaj la ordinaraj homoj? Ili skuas la kapon, kaj diras: Ni ne plu
kredas je la atoritatoj. Certe dekstruloj frotas la manojn pro
kontenteco. Kiam alvenos novaj elektoj, ili estas pretaj enkasigi
la gajnon de malkontentaj vooj.

<H3>FLANDRUJO</H3>
<H2><I>Miraklo ne estas miraklo</I></H3>
i-jare la Centra Publika Biblioteko de Bruo en Belgio dediis
apartan ekspozicion al Simon Stevin, unu el la plej eminentaj
``filoj'' de la urbo. Sed kiu estis Simon Stevin?<P>
Naskiinte el negeedzoj en Bruo (Flandrujo), Simon Stevin
(1548-1620) laboris en tiu urbo kiel imposta skribisto, kaj kiel
kasisto kaj librotenisto en Antverpeno. En 1581 li eklois en
Leiden [Lejdn] kaj tie enskribiis kiel studento en la
universitato. Pro lia eruditeco kaj pedagogiaj kvalitoj nomumis lin
lia konsilisto la princo Maurits, grafo de Nassau, irka 1590.
Kiam li estis 68-jara Simon Stevin edziis al Catherine Cray el
Leiden, kiu jam naskis al li 4 infanojn, i.a. Hendrick, kiu
eldonis liajn postlasitajn notojn. Li mortis kiam li estis
proksimume 72-jara en 1620, verajne en Hago.<P>
La periodo necertplena dum kiu vivis Simon Stevin arniris inter
la mezepoko kaj la modernaj tempoj. La sciencoj ekzaktaj trairis
de la ekzameno teoria en universitatoj al la empiriismo de
invididuaj esploristoj. Stevin agis ambakampe, kaj lia devizo
``Miraklo ne estas miraklo'' estas pli ol esprimo trafa. La Stevin
la homa menso logika kapablas trovi pruvon por fenomenoj t.n.
miraklaj. Analoge kun la tiama periodspirito li ne rigardis la
mondon tiel mirakla kiel i aspektis, nek tiel dia kiel la eklezio
asertis, nek tiel neklarigebla kiel la mezepokaj sciencistoj in
priskribis.<P>
La ``erudita vivo'' de Simon Stevin komenci&#248;is post kiam li
forlasis Flandrujon eble pro religiaj kialoj. Ekde 1582 li eligis
siajn ideojn per pluraj libroj, kiujn presis la eldonisto
Kristoforo Plantin. El tiuj publikigaoj montriis, ke Simon Stevin
estis multsciulo en sciencoj. Nesciate estas kiam, kiel, kie a
e u li ricevis ian sciencan formadon. La klaraj priskriboj en
liaj verkoj de urboj kiel Parizo, Dancigo, Kalezo, Elbing kaj
Braunberg supozigas tamen, ke li tiam vojais eksterlande kaj
vizitis ilin.<P>
Lia plej granda merito kiel originala pensulo troviis en la
kampo de matematiko kaj fiziko. Li pledis ekzemple por la
enkonduko de la dekuma sistemo (ekz. reprodukti frakciojn dekume
anstata sesdekume a okdekume), tage pruvis la leon de
Arimedo, malkovris en la statiko la ekvilibron de la fortoj,
malakceptante la ``movon senfinan'' (<I>perpetuum mobile</B></U></I>), kaj en la
hidrostatiko la hidrostatikan paradokson. Dum sia servo e princo
Maurits, kapabla armeestro, Stevin rivelis sin kiel
fortikaokonstruiston, urboplaniston kaj financan konsiliston. Liajn
rektlinie desegnitajn kampadejojn kaj urboplanojn la nederlandaj
koloniistoj kunprenis transmaren i.a. al Ameriko, kie ili iis la
bazo de la modernaj, usonaj urbegoj. Krome li skizis kiel
meritplena ineniero multajn utilajn ilojn, de
``patopiohakilo'' - ankora nuntempe uzata en la armeo - is
vinoj uzantaj malgrandan forton por movi grandegan aron, kaj
elpensis plibonigojn por kluzoj kaj mueliloj. Ladire, princo
Maurits de Nassau konsideris tiel gravaj la manuskriptojn de
Stevin pri la militarto, ke li kunprenis ilin en kestoj dum siaj
militiroj. Pro timo perdi tiun trezoron, la princo presigis ilin.<P>
Dum periodo, kiam en Sciencujo la latina lingvo uziis kiel la
``universala'' lingvo, Simon Stevin konvinke kaj konsekvence verkis
siajn librojn dic-lingve. La dica lingvo estis la popollingvo en
la tiamaj Nederlandoj. En siaj libroj Stevin uzis vortojn
tradukitajn rekte el la latina kaj greka lingvoj. Se traduko ne
ekzistis, li mem kreis vorton. Tial ekz. la nederlanda lingvo nun
havas propran vorton<I> wiskunde</I> por matematiko, kvankam la
irkaantaj lingvoj uzis la radikon ``matematik'' a derivaon de
i. En iuj kampoj de sia scienca aktivado, i.a. aritekturo,
natiko, astronomio, urboplanado, militarto, muziko, dialektiko,
ktp., li enkondukis nederlandlingvajn nociojn. La nederlandan
Stevin trovis e pli taga lingvo ol la latinan, ar ``i havas pli
da unusilabaj vortoj, ebligas esprimi nociojn tiel bone kiel la
latina, kaj estigi emociojn e la askultantoj''. Tre
verajne, la flandra skribisto Kiliaen, kompilante sian unuan
vortaron nederland-latinan, baziis sur la Stevina vort-provizo.<P>
La Simon Stevin ekzistis anta la antikva tempo periodo, kiun li
nomis ``Satempon'', kaj dum kiu la homa saeco atingis sian
apogeon. Por reatingi tiun, li intencis popularigi la
sciencon, igi in alirebla por iuj, e nestudintoj. La efa ilo
por tio estas la lingvo. Komprenante, ke pro sia malfacileco la
latina lingvo estis neuzebla por nestudintoj, kaj tial
malsukcesis kiel universala lingvo, li konvinke uzadis la
popollingvon. Alivorte: Stevin komprenis - tute kiel Zamenhof -
ke universala lingvo nepre estu de iuj lernebla, kaj de
altniveluloj kaj de malaltniveluloj. Anstata adapti la homojn al
la lingvo, ili amba siamaniere adaptis la lingvon al la homoj.<P>
Pri tiu Bruo-devena humanisto oni rakontas ne pli ol kelkajn
kliaojn en la lernejoj en kaj ekster Flandrujo, sed multaj pli
bone konataj sciencistoj famiis surbaze de la principoj
establitaj de Simon Stevin.<BR>

<H2><I>Antikva kutimo</I></H2>
Britio havas multajn tre malnovajn tradiciajn kutimojn - same
supozeble oni havas en aliaj landoj. La britoj respektas kaj ripetas
tiujn tradiciojn, parte por konservi iun rilaton al ilia historio,
deveno, kaj parte por distrio kaj amuzio. Preska
senescepte ili havas nun neniun praktikan valoron, kvankam, kiam
ili estis unue establitaj, ili ja estis gravaj aferoj en la socio
de tiu periodo. Kelkfoje ili rilatis al mondonacoj de mecenato, kiu
postulis, ke oni ripetadu ion en postaj jaroj - e dum jarcentoj.
Kelkfoje ili ekestis omae al iu persono a grava evento. Kaj fojfoje la
tradicio havas religian originon. Ni menciu la Benadon de la
Maro, en nord-orienta Anglio: tio estas danko al Dio pro la abundo
da fioj tie kaptitaj. Jam en antaa numero ni priskribis la
ornamadon de putoj en meza Anglio, kie oni dankas al la akvodio
pro plua jaro da pura akvo donata al la vilaoj.<P>
Jen estas tradicio, kiu iam havis tre praktikan utilecon, kaj
nun, kvankam ne plu tiamaniere utila, i liveras grandan
intereson kaj iom da instruado al partoprenantoj kaj spektantoj.
Oni nomas tiun tradicion ``la batado de la limoj'' a ``la batado e
la limoj''. Anta pluraj jarcentoj, kiam oni dividis terenon inter
pluraj homoj, ekzemple, bienojn inter farmistoj, a
parcelojn inter agrokulturistoj, mankis mapoj kompreneblaj al la
koncernatoj. Fakte, tre malmultaj homoj komprenis, kio estas
desegnado de mapo sur papero. Nur konkretaj aoj, kiaj heo, a
rivereto, ponto, a roko, povis indiki la limojn de donata
grundo. Distancojn oni mezuris per paoj de normala viro. Ofte
oni devis redifini limojn, precipe kiam okazis enveno de nova
posedanto, a kiam oni volis krei alian terenon. Grava divido
estis tiu inter parooj, kie novaj preejoj estis konstruitaj, a
novaj episkopoj faris impostojn. iuokaze estis necese, ke iu
persono, ambaflanke de la limoj, konsentu kaj memoru pri ili,
jaron post jaro, por ke la limoj ne perdiu nek estu forgesitaj.<P>
Tial oni promenadis la limo en la fino de la jaro post ia
establo, kaj posedantoj de la tereno aliflanke de la limo
promenadis samtempe, por interkonsenti ke ne estis iu eraro, ke ne
estis forgeso, ke neniu rabas la alian de ties grundo. Je tiu
renkonto, ambaflanke oni portis bastonojn, a tigojn, a
armilojn, per kiuj ambaflanke oni batis la teron a iun ajn
signon de la limo. Tiajn ceremoniojn ordinare oni faris iujare,
sed en kelkaj okazoj la periodo estis tri-jara, a e pli longa.
Pro tio, nur la plej junaj partoprenantoj batis la limojn. La
junuloj devus memori ilin, e kiam la pli aaj jam mortis. Tio
estis la<I> batado de la limoj.</I> Tamen, kiam la periodo
estis iom longa, e la junaj forgesis de tempo al tempo, ar ne
estis grava por ili la preciza loko. Tial oni komencis bati la
postaojn de la knaboj, por ke ili memoru, kie ili ricevis la
batojn. Fojfoje oni starigis knabon sur la kapo por tion bone
memorigi al li.<P>
De kiam oni lernis la arton desegni mapojn, kaj fiksi barilojn,
tiu kutimo iom fadis el la praktika uzado. Sed ankora nuntempe,
jarcentojn post la neceso, en diversaj partoj de Britio oni
sekvas tiun kutimon, nur pro pensado pri la heredao, pri la
historio, kaj por feria amuzado. La plej fama limo estas irka la
granda Turo de Londono, apud la rivero Tamizo. Tie knabaj
akolitoj de la paroestro lin sekvas batante la teron kaj
simbolajn plakojn sur la muroj. En alia loko, malgranda vilao
iom kreskinta, la limo transiras rivereton, kaj do la batantoj
devas a nai a lui boaton.<P>
Plej amuza afero okazis kiam entreprenema publika oficisto volis
fiksi en la kapoj de la loantoj de kvartalo de Londono
nomata Lambeth, la hodiaajn limojn. Li persvadis la urbestron,
kun la tuta membraro de la magistrato, promeni plurajn
kilometrojn irka tiu kvartalo, kun multe da urnalistoj kaj
urbanoj. La limo kaj grando de la urbo estis ja konataj. Ili
promenis sub pluvo kaj vento, centope kaj trene. Bedarinde, la
nacia registaro havis planojn por plena ano de limoj en la tuta
Londono, do la limoj de Lambeth estis novaj post unu jaro.<P>

<H2><I>Vegetanta homo naskas mem</I></H2>
La bebo fartas sufie bone kaj probable pluvivos. i venis al la
mondo la la natura vojo, kvankam la patrino, 29-jara, dare
restas en komata stato ekde 1985, kiam ia atomobilo glitegis
kontra arbon.<P>
La gravedecon oni konstatis nur meze de la kvina monato. Antae
la kuracistoj missupozis, ke ia intesto topiis. La scenejo de tiu
oka diagnozo estas iaspeca hospitalo en Rochester, NY, Usono,
kie la paciento vegete vivas ekde februaro 1995, kaj kie anta
sep monatoj iu seksuzis ian korpon.<P>
La kulpulon, la patron de la us-naskito, la polico ankora ne
kaptis: tro da suspektatoj en la hospitala stabo. Nun tamen, la
la polico, la DNA de la bebo estos komparata al tiuj de diversaj
suspektatoj ``por antaenigi la esplorojn''. Kial tiuj komparoj ne
estis faritaj pli frue, oni ne scias.<P>
La naskio okazis en alia hospitalo, asistate de James Wood
[ejmz ud], fakulo pri daneraj gravedecoj. Li informis, ke nek la
gravedeco nek la nasko modifis la komatan staton de la paciento.
``Ni neniam atendis ian ajn miraklon'' li diris.<P>
La kuracistoj, kiuj planis operacie naskigi la infanon iom poste,
estis surprizitaj de la meminiciata aku-laboro, kiu daris nur
unu horon. Pro tiu unika scienca sperto ili devus tamen danki al
la gepatroj de la naskinto. iaj gepatroj, katolikaj, ne permesis
la abortigon de la tiam preska 5-monata nepo.<BR>

<H2><I>Seru la muzeon!</I></H2>
Ie en Esperantujo vivas samideanino, kies avino nomata Suzana
edziniis en la jaro 1877. Tiuokaze, de sia patro Suzana
ricevis belegan donacon: antikvan braceleton en tute malordinara
stilo.<P>
Post iom da tempo Suzana vizitis internacian arto-ekspozicion en
Nederlando, verajne en Hago a Amsterdamo. Apud montrotablo kun
juveloj de eksterlanda partoprenanto, Suzana atente rigardis kaj
ekkriis: ``Mi havas tian braceleton!''. La ekspozicianto tuj
montris avidan interesion dirante, ke ia braceleto mankas al la
aro, kaj ke i apartenis al la reino Maria de Medici. Suzana,
kiu ne volis vendi la karan donacon de sia patro, forkuris
timante, ke tiu sinjoro sekvos in.<P>
Nun tiun braceleton posedas la nepino de Suzana, kiu neniam
portas in. i ne estas ria kiel la praavoj, nek iras al
grandiozaj festoj. Cetere, nuntempe estas tro danere porti
valoregajn juvelojn. Do, la braceleto restas kaita en la domo de
konato ia. i tre atus vendi in al la muzeo, kie supozeble
estas la ceteraj juveloj de la aro. Verajne en Francio a Italio
- i pensas - a u eble Usono aetis ilin?<P>
ia filo trovias en tre malfacilaj cirkonstancoj. Pro la
enerala ekonomia krizo tiu 48-jaraa ineniero, kiel multaj el
liaj samprofesiuloj, ne plu havas postenon. La registaro de
lia lando ne donas helpon al senlaboruloj, kaj li havas
12-jaraan infanon, pri kies klerigado li zorgas. Felie, li
parolas plurajn lingvojn, povante do labori kun turistoj, sed por
tio oni bezonas grandan atomobilon, kian li ne havas. Lia
patrino deziregas provizi lin per tia veturilo, por kio i tamen
devos vendi la braceleton hereditan de sia avino. Tial i petas,
ke esperantistoj atantaj artaojn kaj historiajn kolektojn seru
la muzeon, kie estas tiuj juveloj.<P>
La nepino de Suzana promesas rekompenci la trovinton de la muzeo
kondie, ke tiu muzeo aetos la braceleton. i esperas, ke per
tiu vendo ia filo povos eklabori kaj e helpi sian fratinon.<P>
Kiuj esperantistoj havas detektivan talenton? Montru, ke per
Esperanto ni povas kunlabori internacie. Se iu el vi trovos la
muzeon, bonvolu informi al
<A HREF="mailto://fel@knooppunt.be">M<FONT SIZE=-1>ONATO</FONT></A>. La
la priskribo de ties
posedanto, la braceleto estas el oro kun verdaj smeraldoj,
rubenoj, malgrandaj diamantoj kaj blanka klozoneo; en la mezo
estas kronoforma ornamao. Bonan ancon!<P>

<H4>Loejoj en Finnlando</H4>
i-jare oni atingos en Finnlando novan rekordon pri la kvanto de
nove konstruitaj loejoj. Pretios nur 18&#160;000 novaj loejoj,
rekorde malalta nombro. La la taksoj de la konstru-industrio,
ankora 13 elcentoj de la konstruistoj perdos sian laboron
balda. Jam nun proksimume duono de la konstru-laboristoj en
Finnlando estas senlaboraj. ar iujare 11&#160;000 malnovaj loejoj
estas malkonstruataj, la kvanto de loejoj vere pliias nur je
7000. Aliflanke iujare fondias proksimume 28&#160;000 novaj
familioj.<P>

<H3>Margarino malpliigas kolesterolon</H3>
Finnaj esploristoj evoluigis revolucian margarinon, kiu ne nur ne
altigas la kolesterol-kvanton en la sango, sed e malaltigas in.
La frea esploro la nova margarino malaltigas la
kolesterol-kvanton mezume 10 elcentojn, kio siavice malpliigas
la riskon de kormalsanoj pli ol 30 elcentojn.<P>
La kolesterol-kvanton malpliigas substanco nomata vegetaa
sterolo. Temas pri natura substanco, kiu limigas la transiron de
kolesterolo el manaoj al la korpo. La vegetaa sterolo mem ne
sorbias en la korpon.<P>
En la scienca esploro, kies rezultoj estis publikigitaj en
la prestia gazeto<I> The New England Journal of Medicine,</I> oni
konstatis neniajn kromefikojn. La partoprenintoj de la esploro e
ne povis distingi, u ili manas la novan margarinon a
ordinaran.<P>
La nova margarino jam estas vendata en Finnlando. La prezo
tamen almena komence estas grave pli alta ol tiu de pli
ordinaraj specoj.<BR>

<H3>Malordinara kiso</H3>
La 14an de februaro, tagon de Sankta Valenteno, kiu en Litovio
nur ekde kelkaj jaroj estas festata, la komerca radiostacio ``M-1''
iniciatis konkurson de la plej longa kiso.<P>
Tiun i konkurson intencis partopreni 40 paroj, tamen nur dek du
startis: la plej juna partoprenanto estis 19jaraa kaj la plej
aa 33jara. Konkurskondioj ne estis multaj. La plej grava estis,
ke la lipoj de la partoprenantoj ``kungluiu'' kaj la paroj faru
tion starante. Post iu horo la konkurantoj povis ripozi dum dek
minutoj kaj post iu kvara horo dum tridek minutoj. Dum la
konkurso okazis diskotekoj kaj prezentiis diversaj muzikgrupoj.<P>
Unuafoje simila konkurso en Litovio estis organizita pasintjare.
Tiam la plej longa kiso daris 25 horojn kaj 20 minutojn. En tiu
i konkurso la rezulto estis pli impona: la plej longa kiso de la
33jara Eldaras Robertas Bareiis kaj 23jara Vita Rakauskait&#233; sur
scenejo daris 51 horojn! La venkintoj gajnis oktagan vojaon al
Afriko kaj 1000 usonajn dolarojn. iuj interkisuloj asertis, ke
malgra forta kapturno ili anka sekvontjare volus partopreni
similan konkurson.<BR>

<H3>u vakcino kontra aidoso?</H3>
En astralia rukruca sangokolektejo notiis, ke HIV-pozitiva
sangodoninto kaj iuj ricevintoj de lia sango restis sen-aidosaj
dum 10 jaroj, malgra tio, ke ilia infektio estas sendube pruvita.
Sciencistoj malkovris mankon de kelkaj segmentoj de la genetika kodo
en tiu i viruso-klano. u tiu ``difektita'' viruso estas tute
sennoca a u nur pli malrapida ol la kutima viruso, ankora
ne estas certe. Anka ne certas, u la infektitoj pere de la
``difekta'' viruso estas protektataj kontra la mortiga ``sovaa''
viruso. Se la viruso pruvios nenoca i eble povos servi kiel
vakcino.<BR>

<H2><I>Eskapo</I></H2>
<H3>de Alberto Garcia Fum&#233;ro</H3>
Sur la ekrano vidiis kastela halo, kie hordo da gnomoj postkuris
la heroon. La situacio aspektis senespera.<P>
-&#160;Helpu lin, D-ro.<P>
D-ro Gonz&#225;lez etis flugan rigardon al la dormanta infano, konstatis
lian rapidan spiradon kaj turnis sin denove al la ekrano.  Permuse
li alklakis la pendomenuon ``anoj'', elektis ``Deeksterajn'' kaj
denove alklakis. Fenestreto montranta diverstipajn bildetojn
aperis. Alia klako, kaj la tero fendiis inter la heroo kaj
la gnomoj. Kelkaj el ili kriante enfalis, dum la tero tremis
kaj kvaza dampita tondro adiis. La heroo, profitante la
surprizon, turnis la dorson kaj komencis trakuri ajne senfinan
koridoron.<P>
La vizitanto demandis:<P>
-&#160;Sed u vere la infano sonas tion?<P>
La psikologo ridetis: iam la sama demando. Kompreneble, temas
pri afero nova kaj konfuziga, spite iajn klarigojn. Li ripetis
la jam parkerigitan respondon:<P>
-&#160;Ni vere ne scias kion li sonas. La sistemo funkcias jene:
ricevinte la biokurentojn kaj oscilojn de la elektra potencialo,
kiuj estias en la cerbo de la paciento, la komputilo elektas
inter miloj kaj miloj da eblaj lud-situacioj. i-kaze i elektis
mezepokan etoson kaj aventuron, plus fantastaj aldonaoj. Ververe
kion ni vidas nur iamaniere spegulas tion, kio okazas en la
menso de la paciento.<P>
La vizitanto rigardis kaj la kaskon kaj la komplikan aparataron,
kiuj ligis la infanon al la komputilaoj kaj ajne faris rapidan
mensan kalkulon. Poste li demandis:
-&#160;Sed kiamaniere oni povas ani la situacion? Kio ebligas al
Vi helpi lin, ekzemple?<P>
-&#160;Ni influas sur la pacienton, iomete modifas kelkajn parametrojn
de liaj biokurentoj, kaj la rezulto vidias kiel modifoj de la
situacio. Nenio grava; etaj anoj de la distribuo kaj potencialo
... la teknikistoj klarigos tion al Vi. Mi estas nur psikologo.
Sed restas ankora aliaj aferoj ... D-ro Hansen, u Vi estus
tiel kompleza zorgi pri la komputilo? Venu, mi montros ...<P>
La vizitanto dubetis kaj post momenteto kapjesis. Invitita de
la doktoro, ili alproksimiis al aliaj aparatoj kaj balda sidiis
pli komforte sur foteloj, malproksime de la aliaj teknikistoj.
Oni alportis kafon, kaj la vizitanto malfermis notkajeron.<P>
Juna cibernetikisto pinis diskrete la postaon de flegistino,
kiu flustris:<P>
-&#160;u Vi frenezas? Ni ne estas solaj!
-&#160;Pa! La estroj nun zorgas nur pri la altranguloj. Oni devas
certigi, ke la mono enfluos ...
-&#160;Ne plendu ... Via salajro dependas de tio ..<P>
La teknikisto flustris ion kaj premetis ian manon.<P>
-&#160;Jen la efflegistino. Mi ajnigos labori. Poste ni parolos.
Tiu olda paviano!!
i ridetis kaj por la dua fojo kontrolis, u io iras glate.
La efflegistino alvenis, konstatis ke io estas en ordo, kaj
kvaza skure alparolis junan helpantinon. Tiu i hastis plenumi
la ordonon. La paviano turnis sin denove al la infano kaj tiam
rimarkis la flugan kuntiron de la brovoj e la junulino.
-&#160;Kio estas al Vi?
-&#160;Mi ne scias ... la infano aspektas iomete maltrankvila. Eble
la psikologo tro prokrastis la momenton helpi lin.<P>
La efflegistino kontrolis siavice, kaj kapneis. Per komanda
gesto i alvokis sian sekvantaron kaj darigis la rundon.
Fone adiis la voo de la vizitanto:
-&#160;... kiamaniere oni povas helpi i infanojn? Mi ne tute komprenas.
La psikologo demetis al si la okulvitrojn, kaj tenante ilin enmane
respondis:
-&#160;Ni prenu ekzemplon. Infanoj suferantaj parolajn problemojn
pro psikaj kialoj ofte kuracias kiam ili akiras iom pli da kurao
kaj memfido. Ni anka povas akceli la kuracadon de pacientoj
kun motoraj problemoj. La luda sperto instigas ilin ekzercadi
siajn kapablojn movi sin. Ili demandas iam pli da ludado, tio
estas, da sonoj, ar nur per i ili povas agi normale ... la
plej oftaj sonoj temas pri sportoj, kurado, ktp.
-&#160;Kaj neniam estias konfuzo inter realo kaj sono? Mi timetas,
ke tio iamaniere ...
- Tio ne konsistigas problemon. Kiam infano ludas kaj alparolas
pupon i neniel pensas, ke tiu kapablas respondi. Bestoj parolas
kaj agas home en filmoj, sed neniu infano kredas tion reala afero.
Revenante al Via antaa demando, i-kaze temas pri infano kripla
je la kvar membroj pro akcidento. Ne estas facile komunikii
kun li ... li ne estas parolema. Li dum jaroj spertis premsonojn.
La eksperimento konsistigis por li unikan sperton ... Tio vekis
lian intereson, kaj ni havas esperojn ...
-&#160;Sed bone, is kia grado la afero funkcias? Mi celas, kiom
da sukcesoj ...?
-&#160;u Vi deziras ciferojn? - la psikologo ridetis - Jen ili.
Li alproksimias al terminalo, entajpis kelkajn kodojn, kaj tuj
surekraniis buntaj grafikaoj - Jen la rezultoj de la lasta
duonjaro: 42,4 elcentoj spertis plibonion, 25,8 elcentoj komplete
resaniis ... tiukaze temas pri malpli gravaj afekcioj. Kiel
Vi vidas ...
Lia voo mallatiis dum la vizitanto kaj la sciencisto plonis
en maron da ciferoj. e la efa komputilo D-ro Hansen komplice
okulumis en la direkto al la aliaj teknikistoj kaj plenfide starigis
la polekson.
Senaverte krio alarmis ilin kaj la komaro komenciis.
D-ro Gonz&#225;lez! Venu tuj! Io okazas!!<P>
iu alkuris, kaj amasiis irka la instalao. D-ro Gonz&#225;lez
forpuis Hansen, sidiis, kaj demandis:
-&#160;Kio okazas?
-&#160;La situacio terure malpliboniis ... io okazis senaverte ...<P>
La heroo troviis anta trikapa monstro: el lia brako elfluis
la sango. Estis tenebro. Kio diable? Kie la glavo?
-&#160;La pulsobatado akcelias!
-&#160;Rapidu! Alportu oksigenon!<P>
Armeo da flegistinoj kaj medicinistoj svarmis.
-&#160;La koro! Atentu!
La psikologo turnis sin al la ekrano:
-&#160;Helpu min, Hansen! Ni enmanigu al li armilon!<P>
Gonz&#225;lez freneze alklakis permuse, dum Hansen kriis sugestojn.
Subite toro aperis en la mano de la heroo. Li tuj provis per
i forpeli la monstron, sed i saltis sur lin, blekante. La
toro falis, dum la heroo ruliis sur la polvo. La tri buoj
malfermiis denove kaj komencis bavi.
-&#160;Reprenu la toron! - kriis la psikologo.<P>
La heroo, kvaza askultinta la krion, leviis, reprenis la
toron kaj apogis la dorson sur la muron, preta por la lasta
batalo.
-&#160;Damne! Veku lin!<P>
Medicinisto respondis preska senspire:
-&#160;La koro haltis!<P>
Harhirtiga blekado devigis al Gonz&#225;lez rigardi la ekranon.
La monstro saltis.
Komaro. Medicinistoj batalis por savi la vivon de la infano,
la psikologo freneze alklakis menuojn, monstro kaj heroo luktis.
Subite brilis glavo, kaj la heroo enpuis in istenile en
la verdan flankon de la drako. i lastfoje blekis, kaj turniis
en verdan pulvoron kiun milda vento forigis.<P>
Finfine!<P>
Oni enmanigis paperan tukon al Gonz&#225;lez, kiu nur tiam rimarkis,
ke li abunde vitas. Liaj okuloj ajnis algluitaj al la ekrano.
La heroo restis senmova sur la tero.
-&#160;Ni perdas lin!
-&#160;For, for!! Ni provos denove!
Kardiostimulilo skuis la infanon.
-&#160;Denove!<P>
Juna flegistino ekploris, kaj aliaj konsole alproksimiis al
i. Silento.
D-ro Hansen tuetis al Gonz&#225;lez kaj kapneis. La etan, senmovan
korpon oni kovris per littuko, kaj la medicinistoj komencis retirii.
D-ro Gonz&#225;lez fermis la okulojn.
-&#160;Rigardu!<P>
La vizitanto perfingre montris al la ekrano, kun okulojn ajne
elirantaj el la orbitoj.<P>
Surekrane la heroo ree stariis, skuetis la kapon kvaza post
forta bato, ridetis, levis ielen la glavon.
Kaj repreninte la toron, penetris defie en la tenebron.

<h3>de Alberto Garcia Fumero</H3>
<H2><I>Infanao</I></H2>
La fakestro, D-ro Thorsen, apogis sin sur la kubutoj kaj petis:
``D-ro Martinez, bonvolu esti kiel eble plej konciza. Mi devos
alfronti homojn ordonemajn, ne orodonemajn, kaj se mi ne sukcesos
konvinki ilin je la utilo de Via esploro, ne plu estos mono kaj
ni devos haltigi ion. Diru do klare u estas jam rezultoj, jes
a ne?''<P>
Rippy glutis salivon kaj respondis sen tro da kurao:<P>
``Ne, ankora ne. A pli uste dirite, jes. Nu, la potencialoj ...''<P>
La fakestro demetis al si la okulvitrojn, surtabligis ilin, kaj
pretis pacience askulti. Rippy rekomencis, stumblis e la vortoj
kaj petegis:<P>
``Parolu Vi, Trejt.''<P>
La insekto kuis pli komforte sur la brakseo kaj irpis:<P>
``La celo de nia esploro estas pruvi la ekziston de difinitaj
bioelektraj potencialoj ligitaj al specifaj malsanoj, kaj e al
kelkaj psikaj statoj. Se ni sukcesos, ni estos kapablaj pli
facile kaj precize diagnozi. Kiel Vi sendube vidos, la esploro
pruvias grava.''<P>
D-ro Thorsen ree rajdigis la okulvitrojn sur sian nazon, rigardis
la telefonon kaj etendis la brakon, sed haltis:<P>
``Kaj kio okazas? ajne estas tubero en la afero, u ne? u Vi
povus klarigi tion al mi, D-ro ...? Nu, mi neniam sukcesas
rememori Vian familinomon ...''<P>
La insektaj okuloj sparkis gaje:<P>
``Mia grupnomo estas Txhijjekt. ar tia sonkombino estas evidente
malfacile prononcebla de teranoj, bonvolu nomi min Trejt, kiel
faras iuj. Jes, estas problemo. Ni ankora ne sukcesis precizigi
la valorojn. Oni ja konscias pri ekzisto de gamoj ligitaj al la
diversaj organoj de la korpo homa, sed en ekstremaj kondioj la
valoroj ege varias.''<P>
D-ro Thorsen diskrete tamburis per la fingroj sur la tablon.
Rippy movetis sin malkviete:<P>
``ajne, ke ni ankora ne sukcesis alustigi la selektilon de la
ricevilo. Temas pri hiperfajna selektado ... La tuta afero estos
portebla en poo, u Vi scias? La paciento nur bezonos porti sur
si la mezurilon, kaj do pere de la ricevilo ...''<P>
La krito darigis kalme sian eksplikon:<P>
``Do, estus konvene disponi pri ankora iom da tempo. Restas
ankora tro da mallumo en la afero, kaj estus nepardoneble hasti
respondi jes a ne.''<P>
La fakestro levis la okulojn al la ielo.<P>
``Okazas, ke la nuna tendenco e la Konsilio estas kiel eble plej
draste ekvilibrigi la bueton. Oni sisteme stucis iujn
programojn. Mi tutsimple ne povas prezenti al ili duonbakitan
ideon. Ili prave argumentos, ke la monon oni prefere dediu al
aliaj sanprogramoj. Oni ankora seras monon por nova hospitalo
en ...''<P>
Rippy eksplodis:<P>
``Diable, scienco ne estas domzorgantino! Nur stultulo postulus
rezultojn lamende!''<P>
D-ro Thorsen levis manon:<P>
``Sufie, D-ro Martinez. Mi ne kreis i mondon. Mi nur naskiis i
tie. Tiel restas la afero: postmorga mi kunsidos kun la
konsilianoj. Mi faros ion eblan, sed se tiam estos nenio nova,
la plej probabla estos ... nu, ni vidos.'' - lia mano skizis
adiaon - ``Mi devas nun kontroli aliajn aferojn ... Vi ne estas
la unusolaj, kiuj alfrontas problemojn.''<P>
La krito malgrimpis la seon kaj trenis post si al Rippy. Tiu i
aspektis mizere.<P>
``Sed ni estas tiel proksime! Diable, sufius eble nur tri
monatoj!''<P>
Trejt pinis diskrete al li la kruron, kaj irpis:<P>
``Dankon, D-ro Thorsen. Ni tre alte taksas Vian helpon. Kun Via
permeso, ni foriras. Sanon por Via filo.''<P>
``Ej, kiel Vi scias ...?''<P>
La krito irpis milde, fermante la pordon:<P>
``Ne gravas. Dankon denove pro Via atento.''<P>
Ili foriris, dum D-ro Thorson gapis.<P>
Rippy alrigardis la kriton, kaj demandis kun miro:<P>
``Nu, kompan', kio estas al la filo de la olda krabo? kaj kiel Vi
sciis? Kaj ...?''<P>
La insekto komencis malsuprengrimpi la tuparon, salutante per
svingo de la tarso blondan armulinon. i ridete lanis al i
kison.<P>
``ajnas, ke lastatempe la inteligentec-kvociento de junulinoj
altiis. Anta du sunaj jaroj i tie eblis vidi nur tazitajn
vizaharojn. Tio pensigas min pri Ndrzej. i aspektis tiel rave,
kiam i eniris la medicinan instituton ...''<P>
La junulo flankenmetis la rimarkon:<P>
``Ne primoku min, olda amik'. Kiel Vi sciis, ke la eta Jojo
malsanas?''<P>
Trejt frotis al si, sed diskrete<SUP> 1 </SUP>la karapacon per la balustrado,
kaj klarigis, dum saeco sparkis en liaj okuloj:<P>
``Hodia D-ro Thorsen, kiu cetere ne havas tro da pacienco, simple
ne kapablas kunligi ideojn. Lia filo devos alfronti kirurgan
operacion. u Vi rimarkis, ke iam, kiam lia rigardo trafis la
surtablan portreton de la infano, lia mano tremetadis? Cetere,
D-ro Thorsen iam prezentas al ni usrazitan vizaon kaj hodia
ne estas tiel. ajnas, ke li vigilis ... u tiu vorto estas
akceptinda? iakaze, ajne li maldormis la tutan nokton. E larvo
estus rimarkinta tion. Li estas videble nervoza, kaj la telefono
estas pli proksime al lia mano ol kutime ...''<P>
Rippy interrompis ride:<P>
``Nu, olda, Vi iam gapigas min. Vi estas tiel detalema ...'' - kaj
post momenteto demandis - ``Nu, kio pri la operacio ...?''<P>
``... laste, mia filo ukte kaj Jojo estas lernejkamaradoj.'' -
konkludis la insekto skizante imiton de rideto. Kvankam insektaj
makzeloj estas tute senesprimaj, la rezulto estis rimarkinda.<P>
``Vi, fripono! Sed, revenante al la diskuto kun D-ro Thorsen ...''<P>
La krito, atinginte la teretaon, proponis:<P>
``En la parko ludas infanoj, kaj novdungita knabino vendas
bongustajn okolad-glaciaojn. u ni promenu?''<P>
Rippy ne povis ne rideti.<P>
``Vi estas la bildo mem de la kalmo. A, Vi kritoj!''<P>
``Novluno estas la sola certa signo, ke iam estos plenluno. ar ni
faris ion fareblan, kaj ne estas konsciencriprooj, ni uu tiun
mirindan donacon, kiu estas vivo. Morga venos novaj zorgoj kaj
novaj feliaoj.''<P>
La krito rigardis la infanojn ludi, kaj demandis:<P>
``Parolante pri felio, kio pri Lester? Jam de anta kelkaj tagoj
mi ne vidas Vian filon.''<P>
``Seru la Vian, kaj Vi certe trovos lin. ukte estas la frato,
kiun Lester neniam havis.''<P>
La insekto irpis humure:<P>
``Kaj mi kelkfoje scivolas, kio estus okazinta se Lester havus
fraton. Ndrzej diris al mi, ke hiera ili klopodis plibeligi la
katon de la najbaro ...''<P>
<P>
* * *<P>
<P>
Lester konkludis senespere:<P>
``... mi jam ne plu scias, kion fari. Manjo ...''<P>
ukte svingis la antenojn anta ol demandi:<P>
``u vi jam provis diri afablaojn al i? En iuj Viaj filmoj
poradoltaj oni iam diras al inoj dolajn vortojn ...''<P>
La infano rigardis teren.<P>
``i opinias min stulta! Foje mi kurais diri al i: ,Vi estas
bela', kaj, u Vi divenas, kion i respondis? i diris nur:
,Jes, mi scias', kaj turnis al mi la dorson!''<P>
La krito irpis mildege:<P>
``Tio ajnas al mi esprimo je orgojlo kaj troa memfido. Eble i
askultas tro da flataoj. i ne meritas Vin.''<P>
``Sed mi amas in!'' kriis la infano.<P>
``Diru do tion al i, tutsimple.''<P>
Lester grimacis:<P>
``Nu, ukte! e Vi kritaj aferoj estas iam simplaj. Vi estas
tiel logikaj! Vi e ne mensogas ... kiamaniere do oni svatas en
Kritio?''<P>
La insekto frotis al si la karapacon per la seo:<P>
``Kiam venas la tempo, oni portas braceleton <I>khenu</I>. Tio signifas,
ke oni seras parulinon. Tiam inoj simple elektas. Tiuj, kiuj
sukcesis eltrovi amindan parulinon, demetas la braceleton.''<P>
La infano kuntiris la brovojn.<P>
``Do, e Vi elektas la virinoj ... kion Vi faras, se Vi ne amas
tiun, kiu Vin elektis?''<P>
La insekto rigardis lin kun surprizo:<P>
``Sed tio ne okazas! Diskreta kaj saa ino estas iam aminda. e
ni oni lasas tiajn aferojn al inoj. Ili ja scias, kio estas la
plej konvena por la idaro.''<P>
Lester disbrakis senespere:<P>
``Ne surprize, ke ni neniam komprenos Vin kritoj. Kio okazas, se
Vi ne sukcesas ami?''<P>
La insekto movetis antenon:<P>
``Mi ne scias. Mi eloviis anta nur tri el Viaj jaroj... Eble
pajo kapablus respondi Vin. Pajo estas tre saa.''<P>
``Kiu? Ojo Trejt? Jes, sed ... nu, eble. Li komprenas preska
ion. Li e helpis pajon konvinki panjon.''<P>
Lester enpensiis kaj post momento diris:<P>
``Eble mi simple kisu Manjon. Tiam i scios.''<P>
``Kisoj estas kontrahigienaj,'' opiniis la krito. ``Krome, Vi povus
kontai al i Vian nazkataron.''<P>
La infano eksplodis:<P>
``Nu, olda! Ne estu tiel! Helpu min pensi, kion fari!''<P>
La insekto irpis milde:<P>
``Eble se Vi ricevus pli bonajn notojn en ekzamenoj, i opinius
Vin inteligenta kaj aminda. Vi ja povas studi serioze ...''<P>
Lester kvaza blekis.<P>
``Tio postulus tro da tempo! Krome, kion fari pri matematiko? Mi
simple ne eltenas in ...''<P>
ukte svingis la antenojn, kaj siavice enpensiis.<P>
<P>
* * *<P>
<P>
Sekvatage, la mondo ajnis estis kapaltere.<P>
``Sed, Trejt, kion Vi diras? Mi komprenas nenion! El kie Vi tiris
iujn i rezultojn?''<P>
La krito respondis nerekte:<P>
``Mi opinias, ke ili estas esence ustaj. Mi jam kontaktis D-ron
Thorsen. De nun ni kapablos fari pli fajnan selektadon. Miaopinie
la efa problemo estas solvita.''<P>
Rippy skuis la kapon:<P>
``io i estas nekredebla. Mirinde! Kiamaniere Vi trafis la
solvon?''<P>
La insekto svingis la antenojn:<P>
``Nokta meditado iam alportas surprizajn rezultojn.''<P>
Rippy ridis:<P>
``Do, se tiaj estas la rezultoj, anka mi faros <I>sakuriki-n<SUP> 2 </SUP>''<P>
La insekto ajne estis dironta ion, sed silentis. La junulo
darigis:<P>
``Nu, mi iros kontroli i tiujn donitaojn kaj redakti la
informon. Mi sentas min Kolumbo, Netono!'' - kaj eliris uragane.
Juna studentino devis preska surglui sin sur la muron por eviti
kolizion e la koridoro, kaj Rippy blovis al i kison. La
junulino ridetis, skuis la kapon, kaj adresis sin al la krito:<P>
``D-ro Treht, oni atendas Vin e la pordo. Infano insistas vidi
Vin.''<P>
La insekto irpis respondon kaj eliris.<P>
Lester atendis lin.<P>
La insekto sugestis promenadon per tarsosvingo, sed la infano
komencis paroli nervoze:<P>
``Mi venas pledi pro ukte. Mi konscias, ke ni neniam devis tui
la aparatojn, sed ukte nur deziris helpi min. Mi estas multe
pli kulpa ol li, ar mi akceptis la proponon.''<P>
La krito irpis milde:<P>
``ukte devos mediti dum kelkaj tagoj, is li trovos sin mem. Li
rakontis ion al mi. Kion Vi spertis, kiam Vi uzis la aparaton?''<P>
Lester ne povis ne rideti malice:<P>
``Nu ... post iom da provo ni eltrovis kiel alustigi la indikilon.
Kaj kiam en la klasoambro instrunjo Alica demandis ion, ukte
pensis pri la afero. Tiam mi provadis kalkuli la respondon, kaj
iamaniere mi sciadis tuj, kiam mi faradis miskalkulon. Mi kvaza
sentis, ke la respondo ne estas usta, kaj denove provadis.''<P>
La insekto konsilis:<P>
``Provu surpaperigi isdetale ion. Via patro ankora ne scias, ke
en la informo aperos du novaj laboratoriaj helpantoj. Li bezonos
ion.''<P>
Lester demandis surprizite:<P>
``u Vi ankora nenion diris al li, ojo? Kial?''<P>
Humuro sparkis en la insektaj okuloj:<P>
``ar mi ankora ne adis pri pugvergita Netono. u iu, iam
scivolis, al kiu apartenis la pomo?''<P>
La infano demandis malicete:<P>
``Nu, ojo, kiamaniere Vi sukcesas ne respondi demandojn, kaj
samtempe neniam mensogi?''<P>
La krito distarsis.<P>
<H5>
1. Tia kutimo e krito ajnas rilati al la por ili tro humida
atmosfero tera (The Kritian ecosystem, R. Biscay et al.,
Scientific American, aperonta).<P>
2. Meditado estas afero tre serioze rigardata de kritoj. Ili
kapablas mediti sen alpreno de akvo kaj manaoj e dum
semajnoj.</H5>

Pokalo</H2>
<H3>
de Alberto Garcia Fumero
</H3>
``i tien! Mi trovis la frokulon!'' kriis la soldato levante la
glavon. La senarmila homo anta li nur grimacis malate.
<P>
La glavulo antaeniris plu, kaj ridetis.
<P>
Ne tro longe.
<P>
La monao fulme piedbatis lian manon kaj la armilo flugis is i
trafis la muron. Trompite de la finto, la soldato rapide levis manon
por protekti al si la vizaon kontra plia piedbato, sed kubuto
platigis al li la nazon. Li emis, dum kvazatranile mano
rompis lian nukon.
<P>
Vera Preisto estas ja armilo.
<P>
Abbare ordigis siajn vestojn kaj atente askultis. La krioj de la
rotestroj resonis tra la enormaj haloj de la Templo: ``Mortigu!
Mortigu ilin iujn!''
<P>
Kiel savi la Pokalon? La penso marteladis senkompate la kapon de
Abbare... ar la celo de la soldatoj de la duko Orgo estis
sendube la Pokalo de la Veraj Dioj, anta kiu oni armas
nobelidojn kavalirajn; tiu, sur kiu la Plejalta kaj Saa mem
skribis sian nomon; la neelerpebla fonto el kiu la jam delonge
foririntaj Dioj trinkadis gajecon...
<P>
Pensi, kaj pensi rapide!
<P>
La monao trakuris koridoron kaj haltis anta muro. Lerte kaj
trafe, lia mano premis panelon plenkovritan per reliefoj. Parto
de la muro silente glitis maldekstren, kaj Abbare fantome eniris
en novan kaj pliampleksan halon enhavantan plurajn lalongajn,
paralelajn tablojn.
<P>
Plia premo sur panelo refermis la enirejon.
<P>
io en ordo, krom...
<P>
Fulme, danke al la senkompata trejnado postulata al la Veraj
Preistoj, Abbare rimarkis rebrilon sur ponardo, mortosaltis
antaen kaj kriis:
<P>
``Mallumon!''
<P>
La la Addaraj Libroj, la Templo de la Veraj Dioj obeas iujn
ordonojn, kaj trafe dirita komando e kapablus in flugigi. Certe
Abbare ne primajstris iujn sekretojn de la Templo, sed sufie
sciis. Iam, dum liaj knabaj jaroj...
<P>
Sed ne estis tempo por rememoroj. Sago tanis lian kruron dum li
ruliis surplanke. iuj lumoj estingiis.
<P>
Ili portas arbalestojn, konstatis senpasie la monao. Kion fari?
Kvankam forta volo ja povas mistrafigi sagon, Abbare tute ne
deziris tenti Diablon. Bonance la mallumo protektis lin... a
ne? Interesa demando, kiam malamika mano palpas vin celante la
goron. Abbare atomate palpis siavice, orientiis, kaj forke
enpuis du fingrojn en la okulojn de la soldato. Sekvis hurlo
tranita de bato, dum lia piedo tuis ion malmolan. Tablo, ajne.
<P>
Tablo! Jes, la Tabloj!
<P>
Ladire sur tiaj tabloj la Veraj Dioj preparis kaj miksis iujn
mirindajn likvaojn. Abbare mem iam vidis la Altan Sacerdoton uzi
la diajn instrumentojn por krei fadenon ajne pinitan de araneo,
sed pli fortan kaj rezistan ol bronzo. Ja rezistan, ar per tiaj
fadenoj oni ligas la monstron <I>Krej</I>...   Kie estis la flakono da
iuvora akvo? A, finfine! Abbare lerte malfermis klappordeton
kaj prenis la flakonon, plus strigajn okulojn, kiuj permesas vidi
tutklare e en la plej nigra nokto. Kiam li surmetis ilin sur
siajn okulojn, la afero aspektis iomete pli facila. Restis du el la
soldatoj, kaj ili kubutumis unu la alian malanta unu el la
longaj tabloj. Abbare antaeniris malrapide is konvena distanco kaj
etis la flakonon anta ilin. Profitante la konfuzon (kiel estas,
ke akvo povas korodi anstata karesi?) Abbare kuris, tuis la
malferman panelon kaj fuis, lasante post si la kriegojn de la
vunditaj soldatoj.
<P>
La aero resonis de batoj de glavoj. Kien iri? Verajne la duko
sendis iujn fortojn kontra la Templo. Se nur sukcesus eskapi la
Alta Sacerdoto! - pensis Abbare anta kadavro de novico, kiu e
post la morto strebis protekti senkapigitan infanon. Nur la
Ordeno povos bari la vojon al la duko. Sed kiamaniere la soldatoj
sukcesis enpenetri la Templon? u estas perfidulo? Eble tiu
enviema Saro, kiu ajne e kisas la teron piedpremitan de la Alta
Sacerdoto, sed kiu havas la koron tiel nigran kiel alo de <I>Tuji</I>.
A tiu Ario, kiu kurais diri, ke la Dioj estas nur homoj
venintaj el alia mondo. Pri kiu mondo temas? Estas nur unu! Kaj
nun io estis perdita: la misiejoj, la kuracejoj, la laboro kun
la infanoj. Estas famo, ke la duko Orgo ordonis bruligi vilaon
nur pro tio, ke vilaano scipovis legi...
<P>
Pezaj botoj resonis sur la metala planko, kaj la monao rekomencis
sian felisan iradon. Kio pli?
<P>
``La Pokalon!'' - tondris voo de rotestro - ``Seru la Pokalon! Mil
<I>natoj</I> estos la rekompenco!''
<P>
Do la duko ankora ne havas in! Abbare silente preis, danke.
Nur unufoje antae li estis vizitinta la ambron, kie estas la
Pokalo, sed nun li estis devigita orientii kaj iri tien kiel
eble plej rapide. Kiel?
<P>
La homleviloj! Jes, la homleviloj! Pere de tiaj ambretoj oni
magie transiras. Verdire ili estas rezervitaj por la superaj
preistoj, sed sendube la Dioj pardonus al li la adacon ilin
uzi anstata la tuparoj.
<P>
Nur tio, ke Abbare ne sciis kiamaniere ekfunkciigi ilin.
<P>
La monao trakuris la koridoron, turnis sin dekstren kaj
enpenetris la plej proksiman homlevilon. Kiel igi in movii?
Abbare rememoris la vortojn de sia unua mentoro, Adaj: ``En la
Templo de la Veraj Dioj preo utilas, sed pli utilas
mensklareco. Dio ne preas al si mem, do preoj nenion
ekfunkciigas. Logiko regas iujn iliajn farojn, kvankam ni ne
kapablas iam kompreni ilian pensmanieron. Do bonvolu
<I>pensi</I>, kaj
ne estu tiel stulta kredi, ke nura elbuigado de vortoj solvos
ion.'' Jes, jes, kompreneble.
<P>
Krom abundaj sangmakuloj - senpripense Abbare faris signon de
cirklo - kaj eta signoplato, ene de la ambreto estis nenio. Lumo
ajne venis el la alto, el fonto neeltrovebla. Li do esploris per
la rigardo la signoplaton. Ili nomias butonoj - rememoris Abbare
- sed kiucelaj ili estas?
<P>
Pli atenta rigardo permesis al li eltrovi ke la signoj, de supre
malsupren la la ordo de skribo, estis 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Ili ja
kongruis kun la signoj elkudritaj sur la dekstra maniko de la
monaaj frokoj. Eble tie kuis parto de la solvo, ar tiaj signoj
rilatis al la etao, kie loas kaj laboras iu monao. Escepte,
kompreneble, de la superaj preistoj, kiuj uas liberan aliron al
iu etao. La Pokalo troviis en la kvina, kaj uste tiu butono
estis la plej sangmakulita. Eble iu el la superaj preistoj
mortis i tie, dum li strebis savi la Pokalon. Kortuite, Abbare
provis senmakuligi per la ungo la butonon. i estis ja
makulita...
<P>
Subite sago trafis lin.
<P>
La monao ekkaris, dum la pordoj de la homlevilo silente fermiis
kontra la kriegoj de la soldataaro.
<P>
Kio ekfunkciigis la homlevilon? Abbare skuis la kapon provante ne
perdi la konscion. Eltiri la sagon estis nepensebla faro; li do
nur rompis in kaj uzis fingropunkturon por mildigi la doloron en
la brusto. Dume, verda lumeto ajnis salti de signo al signo, is
i fine haltis sur la signo ``5''. La pordoj de la homlevilo
silente malfermiis.
<P>
La kvina etao! Abbare dankis al la Dioj kaj dubetis momente.
Kiudirekte iri? Paoj neadeblaj devigis lin sin turni
maldekstren tra la koridoro. Verda, longa tapio malfortiganta la
sonon de liaj obstinaj paoj montris al li la direkton al la efa
Altaro. Finfine! La monao, senspire, deviis la viton de sia
frunto per la maniko kaj haltis e la pordo.
<P>
Tro malfrue! Flamoj!
<P>
Triopo da glavuloj ridais, dum kvara soldato enpuis tranilon
en la korpon de la Alta Sacerdoto. Kadavro de rotestro restis
surplanke kun tordita kolo, sed kvar pliaj malamikoj certe estis
tro por la maljunulo. Li falis, dum la flamoj komencis vori la
grandajn kurtenojn. ``La Dioj min pardonu'' - preis Abbare, kaj
eligis la krion de morto, kiun oni rajtis uzi nur dum ceremonia
mortigo de <I>Ekl</I>. La soldatoj falis surplanken sintordante,
provante topi al si la orelojn, kaj Abbare trenis sin is la
efa Altaro. Avertite de krio, alvenis pliaj soldatoj...
<P>
Abbare prenis la ruan Pokalon, kisis la blankajn signojn sur i
skribitajn, flustris la nomon de la Plejalta - <I>Diet Coke</I>
- kaj etis sin en la flamojn.

<H2>Tia mi estas</H2>
Li eniris la dancejon malentuziasme. Publika halo, fremdaj
vizaoj, nekonataj muzikistoj, nekutima etoso. Kial, li sin
demandis, mi venis i tien? Diable! Li respondis sian propran
demandon, ar mi ne povas pensi pli distran okupon por plenigi
tedan vesperon. A! Kia urbao! Kia vivo! Kia homo mi estas. Ses
semajnojn en i tiu truo kaj ankora senamika. Jes, kelkaj homoj
konas lin sufie por diri ``Saluton, s-ro Pitro!'', sed e ne unu
konas min sufie por voki ``Haj, Pit!'' Kio estas e mi? Mi estas
sufie belaspekta, - nu, sufie, e se ne tro. Ja, do, sufie.
Iom alta, blondaj haroj ne tre senordaj, jako moda, atleta la
aspekto.<P>
Pitro limiris preter la gieton, nevolonte paginte per avaraj
moneroj. Inoj staris dekstre, uloj kontrae. Kelkaj pavoj
komencis danci, kaj Pitro eksidis e kafservejo. La muziko
grincis aaaaade. Li ne volis danci. Kial pro infero li venis
i tien?<P>
Juna ino sola aliris lin, silenta, kokete proponante sin,
incitante lin inviti in al dancado. Li melankolie rigardis in
kaj subite forturnis la okulojn. i pate seris alian.<P>
La bruado esis, kun eta aplado, la paroj apartiis, kaj Pitro
trovis sin meze de gejunuloj kaftrinkontaj.  Li restis sidanta.
Post tro mallonga pazo la ludisto rekomencis la kakofonion kaj
la trinkintoj eniris la dancarenon, lasante lin sola. Preska
sola. Turnis sin al li linda ino kun amika rideto.<P>
``Venu, mizerulo. Ni dancu.'' i trenis lin al la areno kaj ili
malelegante ufufis la la takto de la tamburoj. i provis lin
gajigi, vane. Lia deprimo estis profunda. ia rideto malrapide
fadis, kaj e fino de la danco, sen dankoj, ili disiis. Pitro
staris, ne elirinte la arenon, kaj etis malestiman gapon al la
irkaaj disirantaj dancintoj. iuj same mallogaj. iuj sen armo
...<P>
FULMO! Kvaza bato sur la frunto lin kaptis ia ekrigardo de du
nigregaj okuloj aliflanke de la salono. Du profunde brilaj orboj
en mirinde bela vizao skuis lin isoste. Kaj i ajne etis tiun
etan rigardon al li - al li - la solulo, la mizeranto. El iuj
homoj en la salono, tiu glora rigardo sagis trans la ambron. Li
konsterniis. Spiregante, li movis sin pli proksimen kaj la
okuloj modeste sin forturnis - sed ne tute, ne longe.<P>
Li atingis in. Li apena povis paroli, simple diris ``Haj''. Li
rigardis en tiun vizaon kaj vidis ne nur okulojn sed amindan,
amigan personon. ``Haj,'' li ripetis. ''Mi estas Pit.'' ``Kaj mi estas
Sara''. Li prenis ian molan manon kaj spite la bruaon ili kune
dancis harmonie, proksime, dole. Lia kapo komencis kirlii. i
evidente resendis iun lian emocion. La dancon fininte, ili
sidis, babilis. Li apena rimarkis ke iaj haroj estis nur bulo supre
de la kapo, nemode ligita per elasta nuro. Ke i portis
malstriktan T-emizon kun devizo de ia agitgrupo kaj malnovan
inzon kun cifaj truoj. Li estis ebria. Kaj i evidente trovis
lin same dezirinda. Ili ne plu dancis, nur babilis.<P>
``Ni forlasu i tiun ejaon'' li proponis. ``Venu al restoracio
Tango tute apude.'' Milde i skuetis la kapon, kaj sammomente
eniris la dancejon du homoj kun azia aspekto kaj ordema mieno.
Ili gestis al Sara, ke i iru al ili. ``Mia patro,'' i flustris, ''ne
aprobas i tian dancadon''. i hezite staris kaj kapjesis al la
azianoj. ``Sed,'' diris Pitro, ``u mi ne povos vidi vin iel denove?
Balda?'' La azianoj senpacienciis. Sara kapjesis, maltrankvila.
``e Burza, ade, naskofesto.'' kaj nevolonte manflirtis adiaon.<P>
Kion povus tio signifi? e Burza. ade. Kaj kies naskofesto?
Pitro reiris al la kafotabloj. Al la kelnero li demandis ``Kio
estas Burza?'' ``Burza? u vi ne konas?? La kelnero gestis al unu el
la plej popularaj dancantoj, kiu ajne havis konstantan rajton
kolekti iujn virinojn en la ambro. Alta, dika belulo, timige
blaga. Tamen Pitro aliris lin dum iu pazo kaj demandis ``u
Burza?'' ``Jes, ja, mi estas Burza. Kiu demandas? Kiu estas vi?'' ``Mi
estas Pit. Novulo i tie. u mi rajtas veni al via naskofesto?''
Pitro miris pri sia nova aplombo. La Burza ridego eksplodis.
``Kial ne? Ju pli da, des pli da. Portu botelon, grandan ... en la
Kukurba Kelo, adon, nokte, e tra la nokto. Ho, jes, venu
novulo Pit.'' Pitro malamis lin dekomence. Kaj komencis dubi. u
tian viron i povus toleri? Sed li riskus, nur por rekonti Sara
denove. iu estus tolerebla.<P>
Tri noktojn li apena dormis. La tago venis al li tre malrapide.
adon li vestis sin speciale lamode, sed subite memoris la
inzon kun la truo, la T-emizon. Li aetis por si latkoloran
erzon kaj krudan pantalonon. Li portis du botelojn, da biero kaj
da vino. Li eestis la Kelon de la Kukurbo tro frue ... neniu alia
venis is preska noktomezo. Inter la tria kaj la kvara inter lataj
dancmelodioj de la metala kasedludilo ... i alvenis. Lia
ekstazo estis des pli ekscita kiam i venis rekte al li, rekte al
lia brako. Ili sidis, kaj ameme babilumis, spite la bruaon. Ilia
mondo estis irkaata de ia mistera nuno nepenetrebla. Pitro ne
povis kredi. Sara ne povis kredi. La horoj rapidegis. i rifuzis
amba botelojn. Subite li insistis ... ``u mi rajtas akompani vin
hejmen ... jam komencias la matena krepusko.'' La vizao de Sara
aniis. Maltrankvilaj faltetoj atakis ian frunton. ``Ne petu
min, Pit, ne petu. Mia patro eltrovus, ke mi estis en i tia
loko.'' ``Sed kiel mi povos plene koni vin en i tia bruao? Kial
ne hejmen?'' Sara firme skuis la kapon.<P>
Vi ne konas min. Vi ne scias, kia mi estas. Eble vi malatus min
se vi scius ...'' Pitro interrompis ... ``Kaj vi ne konas min, ne
scias, kia anka mi estas. Se ne nun al iu restoracio, venu kaj
manu iuloke. Ni manu kaj parolu.'' Sara rigardis silenta en
liajn okulojn. i skuis la kapon is la haroj falis el la senorda
bulo. Maskaro de la palpebro malsekete fluis. Ili rigardis
dolokule, iu al la alia. Sara komencis iom repenti, iom heziti.
Li prenis ian manon ... li ne kurais pli. ``Mi amas vin, mia kara
uste kia vi estas.''<P>
``Pli bone estos, se vi venos kaj manos e mi,'' i flustris, kaj
li tre ekscitiis. ``Tio estus plej bona solvo.''<P>
Denove la du aziaj viroj envenis kaj gestis al Sara. Sara staris.
``Miaj fratoj vokas min. Mi devos iri. Ili helpas min. Mia patro
ne scias ...'' ``Sed Sara, mia kara Sara. u neniam, kiel, kiam,
kie?'' Sara gestis al la fratoj, ke ili iom atendu. i sidis,
prenis papereton kaj skribis. Li petis ankora denove kaj denove.
Fininte la skribon i faldis in, kisetis sian manon al li, kaj
lasis sur la tablo. i malaperis en la krepuskon de la mateno kun
la du fratoj. Li malfaldis la paperan slipon kaj legis:<P>
``Se vi volas vidi min uste kia mi estas, kia mi VERE estas, venu
al i tiu adreso, sabaton je la sesa.''<P>
i donis precizan instrukcion kiel trovi la adreson, meze de
Londonaj stratoj, kiujn li iom konis.<P>
Sabato venis tre malrapide; la sesa horo prokrastis sian alvenon
tro longe. Pitro konfirmis la adreson sur la mapo, kaj rekonis,
ke i trovias tre proksime al la plej fifama kvartalo de la
granda urbo. Apud Soho, la porno-centro de Britio. Tamen li
prenis la slipon lasitan de Sara, kaj komencis sekvi la direkton tie
indikitan. Trans la efstraton, Tottenham Court Road, al malpura
flanka strato. Preter lasitaj ruboj de la stranganomaj kafejoj
tieaj, turnis sin en alian e pli mallogan aleon. ``Diable! Kia
virino estas i tiu? Kien i tentas min?'' Nur unu-du atoj,
pluraj pordoj en la muro, nenia butiko. Fine li trovis la
indikitan anoncon sur vitra pordo. Restoracio MANDEER, Hinda,
vegetara.'' ``Dio mia, u i estas nur putino, kiu varbis min kiel
klienton?'' Li puis la pordon kaj gvatis malsupren la malhela
tuparo. Alfluis al li aromo de hinda kuirado, miksita kun dola
citro-muziko. ``Bastardino. Mi ja eniros kaj donos al i klare
mian opinion pri i! Kia homo i kredas min.'' Li preparis sin por
ion krai, dum liaj piedoj bruis sur la tupoj. e la malsupro li
trovis sin en luksa restoracio, kie sidis grupoj de junaj homoj en
netaj frakoj kaj allogaj vestoj. Ili sidis e tabloj kie trovias
delikataj manaoj de agrablaj odoroj. Hindaj parfumoj estis ie.
La tuta etoso spiris pri klasika Hinda arto, figurinoj kaj
speguloj, pentraoj, kaj lumetoj kiuj flagris delikate. Pitro
neniam en sia vivo spertis tian belan kaj arman scenon de
agrabla kulturo. entila voo apuda tiris lian atenton. Neta viro
en moderna okcidenta jako alparolis lin, kun manoj en prea teno.
``Vi estas sinjoro Pitro?'' Konsternita Pitro povis nur kapjesi. La
majesteco de la loko superregis lin. Lia lango rifuzis paroli.
Flanke, li rimarkis la du aziajn virojn, kiuj kelneris e la
tabloj. La arma viro parolis denove. ``Vi venis por mani e mia
filino?'' kaj li gestis al la angulo de la ambro.<P>
Tie i staris, en digna blu-kaj-ora sario. Abundaj ondoj de nigra
hararo karesis ian ultron, kaj flagretis lumoj en la ondoj. i
etendis du nudajn brakojn sur kiuj tintis braceletoj kaj ringoj.
i maris al li en svelta eleganto, glitis gracie per molaj
paoj. Diino! Sed efe por Pitro estis, ke li vidis denove en la
brilaj okuloj la amon kiun li plej deziris.

Kiam mi eliris el la laborejo mi povis percepti la frean venteton.
Jam malfruiis, la suno falis ... malproksime la maro kaj ia
nelacigebla surfo ... Mi forlasis tiun oficejon, iajn malvarman
lumon kaj eon de vooj ... tiom da aroj de la samaj plendaj
frazoj:<P>
-&#160;Ve! Kion mi kuiros hodia? ...<BR>
-&#160;Ho kia merdo! Jam elerpiis mia kuiroleo ...<BR>
-&#160;u iu el vi scias kiu vendas sukeron? ...<BR>
-&#160;Fi! Mi denove kuiros per brulligno ...<BR>
-&#160;Nur duona bana sapo restas e ni ... ve al ni! ...
<P>
***<P>
<P>
La nuna piedirado ne estus por mi kiel iam: repreni la infanon
el la lernejo, seri panon kaj lakton, enketi u oni liveris
kerosenon a iun ajn ekstran manaon por la loantaro kaj
fine atendi la proksiman tagon ... hodia mi faros pli: eesti
gravan rendevuon e tre atata familio, geedzoj kiuj fariis
inenieroj kiel mi, miaj kunstudintoj en la universitato is
la fino de nia kariero.<P>
Post kvarcent metroj mi alvenis e la apartamenta bloko, tiam
mi supreniris en la kvinan kaj lastan etaon. Dum mi atendis,
is oni malfermos la pordon, mia menso distriis ... kiom bela
estas la mara pejzao! Apena oni distingas la horizonton,
pro tio ke la ielo havas la saman nuancon kiel ia spegulo.
Refoje mi premis la sonorileton kaj tuj eliris Anjo; mia bruna
amikino kun pli ol tridek jaroj ankora ajnis tre juna. Mi
salutis in:<P>
-&#160;Bonan vesperon!<BR>
-&#160;Bonan! ... Eniru.<BR>
-&#160;Kiel vi fartas, Anjo?<BR>
-&#160;Tre bone, dankon! Kaj vi?<BR>
-&#160;Bone ... Kie estas Pejo?<BR>
-&#160;i tie, atendante vin. Sed, sidu mia amikino ...<BR>
-&#160;Dankon!<BR>
-&#160;u vi deziras trinki iomete da kafo?<BR>
-&#160;Nu, se mi vin ne enas ...<P>
Anjo iris en la kuirejon, malgrandan sed tre puran kaj organizitan
ejon. El tie, i komentis:<P>
-&#160;Vi devos atendi iom, ar estas interrompita la elektra energio
ekde la tagmezo, kaj vidu kioma horo estas, sed ankora i ne
estas renovigita. Mi devas pretigi la kerosenan fornelon por
fari kafon kaj la vespermanon, ar eble ``la lumo revenos'' je
la dudek-unua horo, same kiel hiera.<P>
Pasis mallonga tempo. Anjo revenis en la saloneton tenante glason
kun bolanta kafo. La infuzao disblovis delikatan aromon (tian
senton mi ne uis de kelke da monatoj), mi trinkis in tre lante,
kvaza ne dezirante elerpi la agrablan likvaon.<P>
-&#160;Kia plezurego! Jes, vere tio i estas K-A-F-O! - mi deklaris.<BR>
-&#160;Ho jes? Dankon! i estis sendita de miaj gepatroj. Vi scias, ke
ili loas en Santiago, la plej bona el la terenoj por semi kafon,
pro tio ...<P>
Sen lasi fini la frazon en la sidambro aperis Pejo kun afabla
kaj ridema vizao, kiu interrompis dirante:<P>
-&#160;He! bone, ni nun flankenlasu vian kafon Anjo, ar ni devas
submetii al la temo de nia rendevuo.<BR>
-&#160;Ah! kion ... tia temo provokas en mi strangajn reagojn ....
Frost-ektremon kiu trakuras mian korpon ... tiun vualon ekkovrantan
miajn okulojn ... Certe ni sciis pri la daneroj entenataj
de tia entrepreno. La granda plimulto, kiu klopodis nelee eliri
de la lando ne atingis sian destinon. Plenaj familioj pereis
en la ondoj de Atlantiko, unujn fortrenis la fluoj, aliajn mortigis
manko de trinkebla akvo dum la vojao. Precipe trafitaj de la
morto estis la naivaj infanoj. iuj tiuj viktimoj vidis kiamaniere
la faktoj forbatas iliajn belajn iluziojn disetitajn inter la
dezertaj akvoj kun la ielo kiel unika atestanto de tia agonio.<P>
Mi devigas min serenii kaj askulti tre bone Petron. Tiu i
decido estos tre grava por nia vivo.
Mi konsideras Petron kiel fraton, li estas la amiko al kiu oni
alkuras kiam ekestas granda dilemo, homo tre certa pri sia memo.
Ni amba sentis grandan estimon kaj korinklinon reciproke. Li
scias esti rimarkinde zorgema kiam li parolas kaj havas nekredeblan
takton por alparoli min. Lia monologo temis pri preparoj de la
vojao, la eblaj dato kaj elirloko.<P>
-&#160;u vi jam parolis kun la patro de la infano? u vi klarigis
al li ke io estas tre bone planita, ke la jakto fortas kaj sekuras?<P>
Mi povis elparoli neniun vorton, kvankam kaptite de dubo mi kapjesis.<P>
-&#160;Tamara! Vi estas tre silenta kaj enpensiinta. Ne zorgu plu.
Ni kapablos atingi sukceson tie. Vi estas bonega profesiulo.
Jojo havos ion bezonatan.<P>
... Jojo, mia najara kaj sola filo estas tre inteligenta
kaj aktiva, li de frua infaneco sin ekzercas en naado, pro tio
similas fieton en la maro. e siaj fantaziaoj li vidias
kiel adolto subakviganta sin kun impresa izoterma vesto ... mia
Jojo estas miksao eksterordinara, pro tio Pejo sentas tiom
da simpatio al li. Por Petro kaj Anjo li reprezentas la filon
deziregatan kiu ne alvenas ...<P>
La sonorileto de la pordo interrompis miajn pensojn. Alvenis
Johano, viro forta kun hato tre brunigita, kies ekzistado jam
pasis duonan jarcenton. Ni nomis lin ``La Maristo''. Lia nesufia
kulturo evidentiis e la gestoj kaj parolado, liaj aspiroj
estis malsamaj ol la niaj, inter aliaj aferoj li nur revadis esti
mastro de luksa jakto kaj ni sopiris pri altaj spiritaj plezuroj
je kiuj ni jam de du longaj jaroj estis tute senigitaj ... unue
ni ambiciis sukceson en nia laboro kiel profesiuloj dum la sola
kondio estus havi la fundamentajn bezonojn kontentigitaj.
Johano salutis kaj alustigis sin en brakseon uste anta
mi.<P>
-&#160;Vidu kion mi alportas por Jojo - Johano diris al mi - Donu
in al li dirante ke balda ni fikaptos sur jakto kia tiu
i.<P>
La donaceto estis belega miniatura jakto, vera mankreitao de
tre kruda amatoro obsedita de la ideo posedi jakton.<P>
-&#160;He! Johano. u vi deziras iomete da kafo? - demandis Anjo.<BR>
-&#160;Jes, sed adu min tre bone. Al mi donu in kiel devas esti,
en taso de kafo. Mi ne estas kiel tia etulino, kiu preferas in
en glaso. Tiel, neniam ...<P>
Mi sentis, ke li aludis al mi. iuj rigardis min samtempe kaj
spontane ili ekridegis. Por mi estis nenia alia elekto ol forgesi
miajn zorgojn kaj alii al tiu oja oro. Tiu okazao helpis
miajn nervojn malstreii.<P>
Petro emfazis:<P>
-&#160;Ni jam havas nutraojn kaj medikamentojn neprajn por la vojiro.
ar ni devas esti pretaj por iu ajn eventualao ni prenos pli
da petrolo ol kalkulite. Nu, ni finas ... Ni vidos nin morga,
marde, je la sama horo kaj i tie en mia hejmo mem. Tuj kiam
alvenos la momento ni jam havos precizajn lokon, daton kaj horon
por la eliro.<P>
La kvar personoj eestantaj en tiu malgranda kaj komforta saloneto
rigardis unuj la aliajn prononcante nenian sonon kaj ajnante
atomatoj, sin adiais.<P>
<P>
***<P>
<P>
Mi atendis senpacience la morgaan tagon. Tiun nokton ajnis,
ke la horlooj ne antaeniras, la tempo haltis, tamen mi sukcesis
endormii ...<P>
''... suna tago, oni vidis la maron mirinda, sed iaj ondoj
ne havis la kutiman forton. Lalonge je la bordo de la plao
elstaris orgojle la palmoj, kies verdeco malheliis ... Anta
mi staris grandega konstruao je kiu eniris kaj eliris multaj
personoj, i tiel simile al giganta ``Gulliver'', irkarigardis
kun supereco tiujn sensignifajn hometojn. Mi decidis penetri
in, iri is kafejo, peti kafon, sed bedarinde i havis nenian
aromon, sekve mi eliris kaj dum mi iris oni adigis surdigantan
susuron, tiel ke mi ne povis kompreni pri kio parolas tiuj personoj,
kiuj ludas rolon de modbildoj. Mi turnis min al iu demandante:<BR>
-&#160;Kie trovias ludilvendejo? Mi ricevis konfuzitan rideton kiel
respondon. Estis nedubeble ke neniu komprenis min ... iradis
is mi fine celis vendejon e la fino de la strato, enirinte
in tuj mi estis blindigata de tiaj mirindaj ludiloj, sed miaj
okuloj vidadis tiun punkton, kie kuis metala pupo gracie movante
siajn piedojn kaj brakojn. Kia belega pupo por Jojo! i eksonis
agrable, sed balda bruis tiel monotone kaj impertinente, ke
i devigis min kovri miajn orelojn ... Ve! ... Ve! ... Oj! ...
mia Dio! ...'' Kaj mi vekiis.<P>
<P>
***<P>
<P>
Fine estis mardo. Mi komencis la tagon kiel iun ajn alian. Lasinte
la infanon en la lernejo mi pluiris is la laborejo.<P>
En mia oficejo, atomate mi ekkontrolis paperojn kaj trafoliumis
librojn de mia fako, kiuj nenion enhavas pri mia nuna laboro.
En februaro 1992 esis la produktado en la fabriko pro malmulte
da krudao kaj da karburao, sed jam pasis preska du longaj
jaroj kaj i ankora restas senaga.<P>
Plenuminte la taglaboron, mi fermis la oficejon kaj ekmaris
al la hejmo de Pejo. Jam iuj eestantoj atendis min. Per
Pejo ni sciis, ke la dato de eliro de la lando estos morga
mem je la unua nokte e specifa punkto de la marbordo, kie ni
estos enipigitaj ... ni ne dormos tiun i nokton ...
Dum oni analizis la detalojn pri la vojao, Anjo alportis glason
por mi kaj tasojn da kafo por la ceteraj. Turnis sin al mi Pejo:<P>
-&#160;Tamara, vi venos i tien kaj iros kune kun ni. Johano atendos
tie, e la elirpunkto kaj ...<P>
Puf! La glaso falis el miaj vitantaj manoj, i kazis grandan
bruegon. La stimula trinkao kuis disverita inter la pecoj
de vitro. Vidante ion i mi enprenis al mi en la kapon fatalan
penson: - kaj se miaj sonoj estus vidotaj tiel disigitaj kiel
la glaso kun kafo, u? ...<P>
-&#160;Tamara, u io okazas al vi? - Iu demandis.<BR>
-&#160;Ne, ne, senkulpigu min.<P>
Mi ekstaris konfuzite kaj helpis Anjon forpreni la erojn da vitro.
Tuj poste mi isis kaj irante tre malrapide mi ricevis la varman
vangfrapon de nia venteto.<P>
<P>
***<P>
<P>
Balda estos la eliro, nur restis kelkaj horoj. Mi decidis ripozi
momenteton kaj enlitiis kune kun mia filo. Tuj pro granda sento
de kulpo mi irkabrakis lin: Kun kia rajto mi decidis pri li?
u li adaptios al tiu vivado tiom malsimila? Li riproos
min? ...<P>
``... mi sentis marteladojn en mian kapon, mi volis ellitii
sed ne povis ... la ripetita bildo de mia kafo sur la planko,
la furioza maro kun siaj fortaj ondoj, kiuj leviis kiel gigantoj
... en la mallumo mia filo, trenata de la akvoj vokis min senespere
kaj mi ne kapablis atingi lin ... la bruado de tiu metala pupo iufoje
pli kaj pli angora ...''<P>
<P>
***<P>
<P>
Estis la sesa matene, merkredo. Ah! mi rimarkis, ke mia subkonscio
helpis min decidi, la vekhorloo estis ustigita je la horo
de iam. Mi ekstaris kaj refalis en la realon, io estis nur
sufersono. Mi kuris al balkono por spiri kun konsolo la matenan
aeron. Jam trankvila, reveninte anta la saloneton mi trovis
papereton sub la pordo:<P>
``Tamara, mi venis por vi. Mi frapis kelkfoje la pordon. ajnas,
ke vi decidis resti en nia arma lando. Mi tute ne riproas
vin. Kisu Jojon je mia nomo. Balda vi ricevos leterojn kaj
pakaon enhavantan la izoterman veston por Jojo.
is ...!
Pejo.''<P>
Jojo estis apud mi, li ellitiis silente, mi kisis lin kaj
sentis min sekura.<P>
-&#160;Panjo, panjo, vidu boaton malproksime sur la maro, i similas
tiun, kiun donis al mi onklo Johano.<BR>
-&#160;Estas jakto, Jojo, ne boato.<BR>
-&#160;Sed, hodia ni tre frue planis iri fikapti kun Pejo kaj
Johano. Kial vi ne vekis min antae?<BR>
-&#160;Ne rapidu Jojo, ne rapidu ... ili ipos vojon tro longan
... fakte en sona jakto serante ian felion ...<BR>
-&#160;Kion vi diras, Panjo? Kial vi aspektas tiel trista kaj felia
samtempe? Kio okazas ...?<BR>
-&#160;Vi ne komprenos min, vi ankora estas tre sensperta, mia filo,
... sed memoru jene: la felio ne konsistas en havado de tio,
kion ni deziras, certe i estas ami kaj kultivi tion, kion ni
posedas ... kiel ajn malmulta i estas ... sed tie i en nia
lando ...

<H1>1</H1>
Estis jam la 22a horo. Josef Brunner, pastro de Marienreuth, sin
pretigis por enlitii, kiam subite sonoris lia telefono.<P>
``Saluton, Jozefo! &#230;i tie estas Renata. &#230;u vi ankora memoras
min?''<P>
``Jes, kompreneble. Kia surprizo! Kie vi estas nun?''<P>
``En Munkeno. Mi deoras en la turisma foiro. Kaj mi ege ojus, se
ni povus renkontii, prefere jam morga, ar, fakte, postmorga
mi devos jam revojai al Litovio.''<P>
Rememoroj vekiis en Jozefo. Jam pasis almena kvin jaroj, post
kiam li lastfoje renkontis Renata. Sed adante ian voon, li
havis la impreson, ke tio estis nur hiera.<P>
``Lasu min pripensi'', li diris. ``Morga posttagmeze estos
entombigo, sed vespere, jes, vespere mi principe havus tempon.''<P>
``Mi estus ege felia, se tiam ni povus renkontii. &#230;u ni povas
fiksi iun renkontejon en Munkeno?''<P>
``Eble sur la Marienplatz, anta la enirejo de la urbodomo. &#230;u la
19a horo konvenas al vi?''<P>
``Jes, tre bone. Mi kun granda ojo atendos vin. is morga.''<P>
``is!''<P>
Kun skrupuloj Jozefo remetis la askultilon. &#230;u estis uste
konsenti pri la propono de Renata? &#230;u ne estas peko rendevui kun
virino, kiu jam siatempe, e se i neniam malkae tion eldiris,
evidente tre atis enamii al li, kiu elektis la astan vojon de
katolika sacerdoto?
<H1>2</H1>
Jozefo pasigis jam sian infanaon en Marienreuth, bavara urbeto
en kiu la aparteno al la katolika eklezio kaj la iudimana
vizito de la Sankta Meso estis por plimulto de la enloantoj
memkomprenebla afero. La fido je Dio, kiu kreis la mondon kaj
amas iun, donis al Jozefo la senton de irmo kaj varmo. Lia
patrino estis tre pia kredantino, kiu kutimis iri en la preejon
ne nur dimane, sed anka dumsemajne, por viziti mesojn kaj
preadojn. Firme i estis konvinkita pri la usteco de la instruo
de Jesuo, la filo de Dio kaj savanto de la homaro. Kaj firme i
ensorbis lian devizon ami la proksimulon. Jam frue i instruis al
siaj infanoj konduti uste tiel, kiel plaas al la Sinjoro.<P>
La patro de Jozefo, kontrae, estis malpli pia. Foje li mokis pri
la katolika eklezio kaj pri la papo, kaj e se anka li vizitadis
la dimanajn mesojn, Jozefo klare sentis, ke por lia patro la
vorto de Dio ne estas la vorto de Dio. La patro interesiis pli
pri materiaj aferoj.<P>
``&#230;u vi denove elspezais tiom da mono?'', li riproadis al sia -
cetere tre parema - edzino, kaj dare li plendis pri la
impostoj, pri altiintaj prezoj por akvo kaj elektro ktp.<P>
Kia bela kontrasto estis por Jozefo la eklezio, kiu okupiis
uste pri la plej gravaj demandoj de nia ekzisto - la senco de la
vivo, la origino de la mondo, la vivo post la morto... Atente
Jozefo iudimane askultis la predikon de la paroestro, pastro
Gruber, kiu ree kaj ree avertis pri morala dekadenco kaj emfazis
la neceson retrovi la vojon al Jesuo Kristo, kiun Dio sendis sur
nian teron por savi nin de la malbono.<P>
La propono de sia patrino Jozefo fariis messervanto. Pastro
Gruber lin atis. En la sakristio, anta la meso, li foje kun
plezuro starigis sin anta la knabon, ustigis lian kolumon, kaj,
kiam neniu plenkreskulo eestis, li diris, ke Jozefo nun aspektas
belege, kaj karesis liajn ultrojn kaj liajn suprajn brakojn.
Jozefo ne sciis, kion pensi pri tio. Sed iukaze la messervado
estis por li ege agrabla tasko, ar li rigardis in kiel servon
al la Sinjoro. Li sentis profundan kontenton kaj felion en
devoteco.<P>
Jam tiam, kiel okjarulo, Jozefo revis farii pastro, por montri
al la aliuloj la vojon al pli bona mondo. Iom pli ol 10 jarojn
poste li efektive ekstudis katolikan teologion. Li sciis, ke tio
estas granda defio por li. Pro influo de sia patrino li sentis en
sia koro profundan ligitecon al la kristana kredo, kiu jam de lia
infanao estadis lia spirita hejmo. Aliflanke, pro influo de la
patro, Jozefo neniam povis kun vere centprocenta konvinko, sen ia
dubo, fidi al la katolikaj instruoj. Sed Jozefo decidis akcepti
tiun i defion. Li certis, ke neniu laboro donus al li tiom
profundan kontentigon kiel tiu de katolika pastro.<P>
Pasis la studentaj jaroj, kaj Jozefo ordiniis. Solene li
enkondukiis en sian novan postenon, fariante vikario uste de
sia naskiloko Marienreuth. Lia patrino fieris, dirante al li, ke
pli grandan donacon li ne povintus fari al i. Anka lia patro
esprimis ojon, kiu tamen aspektis al Jozefo hipokrite. La patro
iam opiniis la celibaton stultao.<P>
La paroanoj profunde ojis pri tio, ke ilia episkopo konsentis,
ke nun, kiam pastroj - kaj precipe junaj - tiom malabundas, ili
povis ekhavi novan vikarion, kaj e lin, kiu devenis el ilia
paroo. E la fakto, ke Jozefo ne povis tute blinde fidi al sia
eklezio, havis pozitivajn flankojn: En siaj predikoj kaj personaj
interparoloj kun paroanoj li ofte, kvankam iam tre singarde,
aludis la esperon, ke la katolika eklezio iom post iom modifos
sian sintenon pri la egalrajteco de virinoj, pri preventiloj,
demokratiaj strukturoj ktp. Por multaj Jozefo fariis simbolo de
la necesa renovigo de la eklezio. Homoj kun malfirma rilato al la
kredo rekomencis regule vizitadi la mesojn - liajn, kompreneble -<P>
, kaj Jozefo konstatis, ke ne nur e la mesoj, sed anka e la
akcepto de la pento jam plimulto de la paroanoj, precipe sed ne
nur inter la junaj, preferas lin al pastro Gruber.<P>
Fakte, dum kiel infano Jozefo iam admiris la paroestron, tiu
nun aspektis al li malgrande kaj kompatinde. Gruber jam
maljuniis, li havis gejan inklinon, kaj multo, kion li diris
ekzemple en siaj predikoj, estis senenhava a bombaste formulita.
Jozefo esperis, ke balda li sukcesos allasi almena por siaj
mesoj knabinojn kiel messervantojn, kion Gruber iam forte kaj
emocie kontrais.<P>
Jozefo sentis sin bone en sia nova pozicio. Nur foje, precipe
nokte, li sentis iom da soleco. Kaj uste pro tio tiom ojigis
kaj samtempe maltrankviligis lin la telefonalvoko de Renata.
Rememoroj revivias ...
<H1>3</H1>
Estis anta iomete pli ol kvin jaroj. Jozefo renkontis Renata en
semajnfina renkontio de Bavara Esperanto-Junularo en Munkeno. Li
eksimpatiis kun la juna litovino jam je la unua vido. Renata
rakontis al Jozefo, ke post la arano i veturos al Berlino, kaj
demandis lin, u i povus survoje viziti lin en Eichst&#228;tt, por
ke li montru al i sian studurbon. Post ioma pripensado Jozefo
konsentis. Unu tagon kaj unu nokton i restis e li, kaj por ili
amba la kunvivado estis ege harmonia, kvankam, kompreneble,
Jozefo evitis ian troan proksimion. Dumtage Jozefo montris al
Renata sian urbon, kaj vespere li klarigis al i sian
vivfilozofion. Li rakontis al i, ke lia efa celo estas fari
bonon al aliaj homoj kaj nur tiamaniere feliigi sin mem. Li
erpas la forton por tio el la Sankta Skribo.<P>
``Latlegu al mi el la Biblio!'', subite proponis Renata. Jozefo
kun plezuro akcetis la proponon kaj elektis kelkajn versojn el la
monta prediko. ``Vi adis, ke estas dirite: Okulon pro okulo, kaj
denton pro dento; sed mi diras al vi: Ne rezistu al la malbono,
sed al tiu, kiu frapas vian dekstran vangon, turnu anka la
alian. ... Amu viajn malamikojn, kaj preu por viaj
persekutantoj.''<P>
Renata konfesis, ke i devenas el ateisma medio kaj ankora
neniam serioze okupiis pri la kristana kredo. ``La vortoj de
Jesuo sendube plaas al mi'', i diris, ``mi nur ne certas, de kie
ili vere venas, u de la evangeliistoj, de Jesuo a e de Dio
mem.''<P>
``Nia eklezio instruas, ke la evangeliistoj kaj la aliaj sanktaj
verkistoj skribis la Biblion sub rekta inspiro de la Dia
spirito'', klarigis Jozefo. ``Anka mi foje pensis, ke io i estas
nur vortoj de ordinaraj, e se saaj, homoj, same kiel jen kaj
jen mi dubis, u iuj mirakloj el la Biblio, de la virga koncipo
is la resurekto de Jesuo, vere estas supernaturaj okazaoj. Mi
persone kredas je tio, kaj tio donas al mi senton de irmo kaj
kontento. Tamen mi konscias, ke povus esti anka, ke en kelkaj
detaloj mia katolika eklezio eraras, a ke e la tuta kristanismo
bazias nur sur inventaoj.''<P>
Renata miris kaj ojis pri la neatendite malfermaj vortoj de
Jozefo. i admiris lin. Post fino de agrabla kaj pensiga vespero
ili endormiis.<P>
La postan matenon Renata jam devis pluvojai. Jozefo akompanis
in al la stacidomo, kaj nun, unuafoje, li kisis in sur la
vangon.<P>
En la sekvaj monatoj ili ankora korespondis unu kun la alia.
Renata rakontis, ke i sukcesis ekstudi en Hamburgo, sed mallonge
poste ilia kontakto rompiis.
<H1>4</H1>
Akurate je la 19a horo Jozefo alvenis sur la Marienplatz. Renata
jam atendis lin, kaj videbla ojo estis sur iaj okuloj kiam ili
ekvidis unu la alian. ``Vi apena aniis'', i diris. ``Vi bele
aspektas kun via nova frizao'', reciprokis Jozefo. Ili decidis
komune iri en restoracion.<P>
``Jam delonge mi preska tute ne plu havis kontakton kun
esperantistoj'', rakontis Renata. Sed mi kunportis al Munkeno la
adreson de Ina, e kiu mi lois anta kvin jaroj i tie. Hiera
vespere, post la deoro, mi vizitis in. Sur ia bretaro mi
trovis la novan jarlibron de UEA, kiun mi trafoliumis pro scivolo
- is mi trovis vin en i. Kelkajn sekundojn poste mi jam
telefonis al vi ...''<P>
``Mi tre ojas, ke vi faris tion.''<P>
``Lastatempe mi estis sufie soleca'', rakontis Renata. ``Vi scias,
ke mi studis du jarojn en Hamburgo. Sed kiam mi revenis al
Litovio, mi konstatis, ke iuj miaj iamaj amikoj jam estas edzoj.
Mi komencis senti min jam maljuna. Ja en Litovio preska iu
knabino edzinias je 18 a 19 jaroj. Kaj intertempe anka miaj
plej bonaj amikoj el Germanio jam edziis. Nun vi restas mia
lasta espero.''<P>
``Vi scias, ke ...''<P>
``Mi nur ercas.''<P>
``Mi sentas min kiel velkanta floro'', darigis Renata, ``Vidu la
sulkojn e miaj okuloj. Mi jam ne plu sukcesas kai ilin per
kremo kaj minko.''<P>
``Vi dare aspektas ege bele kaj arme.''<P>
``&#230;u vere? Jam de multaj jaroj mi tion ne plu adis.''<P>
``Tute serioze. Vi aspektas same bele kiel anta kvin jaroj, eble
e pli.''<P>
``Tamen nun neniu plu interesias pri mi. Kaj mi tute perdis la
konfidon al la viroj, pro tiom da seniluziioj.''<P>
Renata rigardis en la okulojn de Jozefo, kiam i aldonis: ``Vi
estas la sola viro, al kiu mi plene konfidas.''<P>
Jozefo silentis.<P>
``Vi estas tiom bona, tiom pura interne.''<P>
Jozefo plu silentis.<P>
``&#230;u vi neniam atus edzii al virino?'', demandis Renata.<P>
``Mi jam elektis mian vivovojon. Kaj mi estas felia. Mia laboro
plaas al mi, mi atas miajn paroanojn kaj ili atas min.''<P>
Fakte nur i-posttagmeze, dum la entombigo de la maljuna
sinjorino Zeitler, Jozefo denove konsciiis pri tio, ke la
paroanoj lin bezonas. Li ankora tre bone memoris, kiel anta
kelkaj tagoj li estis vokita al la nekuraceble malsana
maljunulino, kiu dare tremegis kaj kriadis pro doloroj kaj timo
pri la proksima morto. Per sia milda, trankvila kaj konvinka voo
Jozefo klarigis al i, ke la morto estas nur transiro al alia,
eterna mondo. Post kiam li donacis al i la sakramenton de la
lasta oleado, la sinjorino tute kvietiis; sur ia vizao
reaperis kontento kaj interna trankvilo, is kiam - la raporto
de ia filino - i forpasis en plena paco kun la mondo kaj kun si
mem.<P>
``Mi neniam forlasos mian pastran oficon'', Jozefo klarigis. ``Sen
tio mi estus nenio, precipe nun, kiam mia eklezio akceptas
edziintajn pastrojn e ne plu kiel instruistojn de religio ...''<P>
``Vi ja ne tuj devas forlasi ion. Se vi foje pasigus nokton kun
virino, neniu tion rimarkus.''<P>
``Ekzistas pli gravaj aferoj ol tiaj profanaj plezuroj.''<P>
``Tamen, u vi ne atus pasigi unu nokton kun mi?''<P>
``Vi scias, ke ...''<P>
``Mi nur ercas.''<P>
La rideto en la vizao de Renata signis al Jozefo, ke i tamen
forte, tre forte deziris lian proksimecon.<P>
Preska du horojn ili restis en la restoracio. Anta ol eliri,
Renata diris al Jozefo: ``Mi nun atus tranokti e vi.''<P>
``Vi nur ercas'', respondis Jozefo.<P>
``Ne, i-foje ne. Vi latlegu al mi el la Biblio.''<P>
Jozefo pensis pri ilia harmonia vespero anta pli ol kvin jaroj,
sed anka pri la tento, kiu lin verajne trafos. Fine li
konsentis. Jozefo veturigis Renata en sia ato al Marienreuth.
Estis jam preska noktmezo, kiam ili alvenis. Neniu rimarkis,
kiam ili eniris en lian domon. Ili sidiis unu apud la alia, kaj
subite Renata karesis liajn manojn.<P>
``&#230;u is nun vi neniam dormis kun virino?'', i demandis.<P>
``Neniam.''<P>
``Vi diris, ke mi aspektas tre bele kaj arme. &#230;u vi ne atus
...?''<P>
Vidante, ke Jozefo ne rezistas al i, Renata komencis senvestii.
Ili ekridis.<P>
``Ni estas frenezaj'', diris Renata, kiam anka Jozefo komencis
formeti siajn vestaojn. Ili karesis unu la alian e la tuta
korpo, Jozefo in arde kisis, kaj Renata miris, ke ia sensperta
kunulo tiom bone kapablas eksciti in - u lia sekreto estas, ke
Jozefo celas efe feliigi in kaj nur per tio sin mem? Balda
ili amba sentis la plej profundan volupton, kiun ili iam ajn
travivis. Ili preska krevis de felio, kaj ankora longe ili
komune emis kaj ridis, iam denove rigardante unu la alian en la
okulojn. Mallonge poste Renata endormiis en la brakoj de Jozefo.<P>
La venontan matenon ili ellitiis jam je la 5a horo. Jozefo
veturigis Renata reen al Munkeno, por reveni ustatempe por
celebri la matenan meson. Jozefo sciis, ke ilia adiao estos por
tre longa tempo, ar la tutan tagon Renata deoros en la foiro,
kaj vespere i jam revojaos al sia hejmlando.<P>
Kion Jozefo ne sciis, estis, ke tie, en Litovio, atendos in ia
edzo Arunas kun la eta filo. Fakte, kiam Renata revenis de
sia dujara studado en Germanio, i - sciante, ke iaj ancoj e
la viroj pli kaj pli malaltias - edziniis al la unua viro, kiu
interesiis pri i. Sed Arunas traktis in malvarme kaj
sename; ilia iutaga vivo fariis griza, kaj e dum la amorado
kun li i sentis nenion. Nun i scias, ke ne i mem kulpas pri
tio, sed ke i ja kapablas senti veran plenumion. Kaj i scias,
ke i plu estas alloga, e tiugrade, ke kiel la unua virino i
sukcesis delogi Jozefon, viron kun tre puraj koro kaj animo. i
neniel pentis la nokton kun Jozefo.<P>
Anka Jozefo ne pentis ilian komunan nokton. La plej profunda
felio, kiun li spertis, faciligos al li pludoni amon kaj ojon
al aliuloj. Se li tamen sentis iomete da honto, tiam ne pro sia
malasteco, sed pro mensogo: Li ajnigis sin al Renata malpli
sperta ol li efektive jam estis.<P>

<H3>LETEROJ</H3>
<H2><I>Persekutoj en Nierio</I></H2>
<B>De tempo al tempo atingas la redakcion leteroj de kunlaborantoj
en Nierio, pri persekutado de la lokaj urnalistoj. Por ne
endanerigi la vivon de la koncernaj personoj, ni ne publikigas
iliajn nomojn sub la leteroj, nek sub la du akompanantaj
artikoloj.</B>
<P>
Elkorajn salutojn el malesperiga kaj katastrofa Nierio.
Lastatempe mi estis invitita al la policejo, kie mi informiis,
ke mi estas akuzita, ke mi skribas malverojn pri la registaro;
sed ili ne montris al mi kion mi skribis. Mi estis konsilita
raporti al la policejo iun semajnon is ili konkludos iliajn
esplorojn. Du personoj atestis por mi, ke mi ne forkuros is mi
pagis kvin mil najrojn al ili. Du tagojn poste ili venis al mia
domo por seri kaj ili forprenis kelkajn esperantaojn.<P>
Mia timo estas, ke povas esti, ke iu tradukis miajn lastajn
artikolojn al ili a ke iu denuncis min al ili. Mi ne timas, ke
oni povas fari malbonon al mi, kvankam multaj homoj malliberiis
nur ar ili skribis, kion la registaro ne atas. Mi scias, ke
mi skribis la veron.<P>
Mi suspektas, ke oni telas miajn sendaojn a legas ilin anta
ili atingos min. Dum la pasintaj monatoj miaj potaoj ne atingis
min kaj miaj korespondantoj, kiujn mi sukcesis atingi telefone,
plendis, ke ili sendis multajn leterojn, kiuj ne atingis min. Se
vi iam sendos leteron al mi, nepre registru in: sen tio, i ne
atingos min.<P>
<P>
El letero de 95-11-12:<P>
Mi tajpas i-leteron en mallumo kaj kun granda malfelio ar
multaj aferoj malboniis por mi kaj la lando. Mia vivo estas tre
malsekura pro la fakto, ke mi adacis kritiki la registaron en iu
artikolo, kiun mi sendis al iu gazeto. Danke al Dio oni ne
publikigis in, kiam mi estis invitita al la policejo. Mi devis
pagi kvin mil najrojn por esti liberigita. Poste oni trovis, kie
mi kaas miajn artikolojn pri la situacio en Nierio sed mi
rifuzis traduki ilin anglen. Bofrato, kiu estas juristo, aranis
kun la policestro, ke mi pagu iom da mono, por ke ili forgesu
ion. Mi devas trovi la monon anta la fino de i tiu monato. Sen
tio, oni irigos min al tribunalo a malliberigos min.<P>
La situacio en Nierio estas tre timiga. Se oni parolas tre
late, oni riskas esti malliberigita a mortigita. Nepras, ke
oni havu monon a iun en la registaro, kiu povas influi la
policistojn, kiam oni estas arestita. La policistoj iam petas
koruptaojn por influi la sorton de arestito.<P>
<P>
El letero de 95-11-26:<P>
Kiel vi povas rimarki, la situacio fariis tiel timiga, ke mi
decidis ne sendi la artikolojn (red. t.e. de 95-11-12). Nia pota
sistemo mortis sed ajne rekomenciis: la potistoj ree
eklaboras.<P>
Mi intencas sendi aliajn artikolojn depende de mia sekureco ...

<H3>KANADO</H3>
<H2><I>La montreala ekzameno</I></H2>
Preska ie oni scias, ke relative facilas ekloi en Kanado,
u kiel azil-petanto, u kiel enmigranto. Cetere, multaj kanadanoj
plendas pro tiu ``invado''. Kaj post nur trijara restado, eblas
per simpla ekzameno kaj fidelec-uro al la (brita) reino akiri
la kanadan tatanecon.<P>
Kvankam sukcesebla, la tataniga ekzameno estas malfacila, kaj
necesas atendi longe: kelkajn monatojn inter la peto kaj la ekzameno,
kaj denove plurajn monatojn por ekscii pri la rezultoj kaj akiri
la tatanecon, okaze de patosplena ceremonio.<P>
Tamen, dum la unuaj monatoj de 1995, la procedo estis anita,
en Montrealo. La kanada registaro bezonis kiel eble plej multajn
tatanojn, kiuj certe vodonos nee al baldaa referendumo pri
sendependio de Kebekio.<P>
Legantoj de M<FONT SIZE=-1>ONATO</FONT> (1995/12. p. 7) povis legi pri la rezulto de
la referendumo, okazinta en la pasinta oktobro. Ili i.a. eksciis,
ke la ``etnanoj'', t.e. efe la enmigrintoj, vodonas plejparte
por la restado de Kebekio en Kanado. Por atingi i tiun rezulton,
la registaro anis la ekzamenon.<P>
Anstata privataj kaj malfacilaj ekzamenoj, okazis grupaj demandoj,
dum kiuj oficistoj helpis la ekzamenatojn hoki la ustajn respondojn.
Sukcesis e kandidatoj, kiuj klare scipovis nek la francan
nek la anglan, kvankam la scipovo de unu el tiuj estas postulata.<P>
En aliaj okazoj, ja okazis privataj ekzamenoj, sed, konsideru
la demandojn: kiuj estas la koloroj de la kanada flago, u blanka
kaj flava a blanka kaj rua? Kiu estas la efurbo de Kanado?
Kiu estas ia efministro? Unu a du tiaj demandoj, kaj jen
la jam preta atestilo, ni kantu la himnon (A! vi ne konas ... nu lernu
in, karaj novtatanoj!), kaj jen io en ordo.<P>
Kaj kontra tia burleskao neniu indignis: kiam bonas la celo,
bonas anka la rimedoj, u ne?
<h4>Reiru hejmen, se vi ne kontentas!</h4>
Sed, kelkfoje, enmigrintoj ja aprobas la sendependion de Kebekio.
Ekzemple, Osvaldo Nu&ntilde;ez, naskita en ilio, kaj kanada
deputito, ano de l' Kebekia Bloko, partio favoranta la apartion
de Kebekio. En la parlamento, Nu&ntilde;ez kritike demandis
la ministron pri enmigrado, Doug Young, pri la enmigra politiko.
La ministro respondis ke, se Nu&ntilde;ez ne kontentas pri Kanado,
li nur reiru hejmen ...<P>
Kiam urnalistoj demandis la ministron pri tiu respondo,
Young invitis ilin demandi ``verajn kanadanojn'', kion ili opinias
pri tiaj enmigrintoj, kiuj antaenigas la ``detruon'' de tiu lando,
kien oni ``bonkorece kaj larmense bonvenigis ilin''. La kanada
efministro Jean Chr&#233;tien aprobis sian ministron.
Nu&ntilde;ez apena miris. Neniu devis demisii ...<P>

<H2><I>Murdo de heroa urnalistino</I></H2>
La urnalistaro en tuta Irlando funebras kaj kondamnas la
brutalan kaj kovardan murdon de unu el la plej kuraaj naciaj
urnalistoj. Temas pri Veronica Guerin, juna
patrino de 9-jara fileto, kaj raportistino e unu el la plej
gravaj urnaloj en Dublino.<P>
Veronica dum sia tragike mallonga vivo, esploradis la aktivecon
de la plej daneraj dublinaj krimuloj, konataj al la publiko
nur la kanomoj, ekzemple ``La Monao'', ``La
Generalo'', ``La
efo de la fabrikeja bando'', ktp. Trifoje oni pafile atencis
kontra ia vivo. Pli frue i suferis ``nur'' gravan kruran
vundon. Sed la trian fojon, kiam Veronica veturis sola en sia
tro videbla rua atomobilo, sur oseo en Clondalkin [Klondalkin],
Dublino, du viroj sur blanka motorciklo alproksimiis, kaj la
pasaero sur la posta selo senaverte pafis ses kuglojn en ian
sendefendan korpon.<P>
La okitaj anoj de la irlanda parlamento kaj la publiko timas,
ke tia gangsterismo povus minaci la tutan demokratan strukturon
de la Respubliko. Samtempe, multaj akuzas la registaron kaj la
juristojn pro la fakto, ke evidente la tro malsevera learo pli
emfazas individuan liberecon ol protekton de la vivo de civitanoj
kaj punadon de krimuloj.<P>

<H2><I>Nova - sed negativa</I></H2>
Ekde la fino de la enlanda milito (1922-23), kiu sekvis la
sendependion de Irlando, estas nur du fortaj politikaj partioj
en la lando. Ideologie (se ili entute posedas iun ajn veran
ideologion) la du estas apena distingeblaj, estante pli-malpli
centrece dekstraj, kaj uldas sian apartan ekziston al la nura
fakto, ke ili estas posteuloj de la du flankoj, kiuj dum tiu
milito interbatalis pri la kondioj de la sendependiga traktato.
ar tiu malnova disputo ne plu koncernas la hodiaan Respublikon,
multaj irlandanoj opinias, ke la lando bezonas tute novan
partion.<P>
Kelkaj pli modernaj partioj jam ekzistas (la progresema
demokrata, la verdula, ktp), krom la malnova laborista, sed ili
estas malgrandaj. Parenteze, <I>Sinn F&#233;in</I> [in Fejn], konsiderata
kiel la politika alo de IRA, la militema respublikana organizao
respondeca pri tiom da brutalaj terorismaj atencoj, havas
malmulte da adeptoj en la Respubliko, kaj ne sukcesis elektigi e
unu membron al la D&#225;il [Dojl] (nacia parlamento en Dublino).<P>
En la unuaj monatoj de 1996, tamen, estis lanita nova politika
organizao, nome la <I>Nacia Partio de Irlando</I>, televide priskribita
kiel ``ekstreme dekstra partio''. Laajne, kaj la epiteto ``nacia'',
kaj la priskribo ``ekstreme dekstra'' fare de iaj kritikantoj,
estas iom erarigaj, ar la nova partio estas fakte
hiperkonservative katolika, kampanjante kontra eksedzio,
abortigo kaj koncipoprevento. Oni forte dubas, u tiaj negativaj
- kvankam neriproeble vatikanaj - celoj iel ajn kontribuos al
solvo de la veraj sociaj problemoj de la Verda Insulo.<BR>

<H3>HUNGARIO</H3>
<H2><I>Eliksiro bezonata</I></H2>
Forpasis du jaroj de la eble kvarjara socialista-liberala koalicio.
i posedas tri kvaronojn de la vooj kaj la kabineto havas iujn
eblojn politikadi stabile, sisteme. Tamen, se oni rigardas
desegnaon en M<FONT SIZE=-1>ONATO</FONT> (1996/6 p. 18), la duontempa atesto
estas malbona. Ne nur la ekonomio stagnas, sed anka kreskas
la inflacio kaj senlaboreco. La plej akuta problemo estas financa
manko en la sanitaraj servoj kaj en la pensiaj elspezoj. Tial
la kabineto volas levi la pensian aolimon. Tio estas e viroj
la 60a jaro, e virinoj la 55a. Oni planas por iuj la
62an jaron, kiu pli similas al la eropa meznombro. Sed, se oni
enkalkulas la laborkondiojn kaj la sanstaton, neniu miras pri
la rezisto de la sinkidatoj.<P>
La tato draste malpliigis la socialajn servojn. Ekzemple, esis
senkosta dentokuracado. Balda la kabineto nuligos tion pro
la evidenta damao. Nur riuloj iris al dentkuracisto. Plue,
privatigo estis sukcesa nur por la kabineto. Precipe germanoj
kaj francoj aetis la gasan, elektran kaj telefonan sektorojn.
Sekve la internacia uldo malpliiis. Tamen la efiko de tiuj negocoj
estas nevidebla. La importo-imposto levis la inflacion, mallevis
la vivnivelon, sed tamen estas tendenco por kreskigi la eksporton.<P>
La opozicio profitas nenion el fiaskoj de la kabineto. La dispecigita
opozicio nun ne povas doni alternativon. Estas enigmo, kio okazos
dum la sekva balotado. Pri alio al Eropa Unio iu politikisto
konsentas. ajne, tio estas la unusola eliksiro por Hungario.<P>

<H3>TUT-HUNGARISMO</H3>
<H2><I>Mozaika popolo</I></H2>
Kritikiis la festparolado de la hungara ministrestro Julio Horn
dum la kvara universala renkontio de la hungararo en Budapeto.
La antaa efministro Jozefo Antall jam deklaris tuj post la
balotado: ``Mi estas efministro anime por 15 milionoj da hungaroj''.<P>
Kiel sciate, 10 milionoj vivas en Hungario; la ceteraj vivas dise, ekster
la landlimoj. Tiun frazon Horn nuligis, kaj la eksterhungariuloj
nun sentas mankon de morala kaj eble financa apogoj de Hungario.<P>
La renkontio determinis la hungararon mozaika popolo. Hungaroj
vivas tutmonde, ere, mozaike. Se perdias mozaikero, la bildo
difektias kaj valoras nenion. Tial oni devas gardi iujn erojn.
La Horn, la kabineto reale kaj ne senteme politikas. Ja al
la Slovaka-Hungara Kontrakto jesis la hungara minoritato en la
slovaka parlamento.<P>
La kongreso okazis omae al la 1100-jara datreveno de la hungara
patrujokupado.<P>

<H2><I>Publikeco mankas pri EU-dokumentoj</I></H2>
Anta la alio de Finnlando al la Eropa Unio oni multe parolis
pri sekretema politika EU-kulturo. Subtenantoj de la alio
asertis, ke oni neniam povos akcepti sekretigon de gravaj
dokumentoj. Tamen Finnlando is nun ne sukcesis ani la EU-kutimojn
kaj e devis konstati, ke sekretemo ajnas invadi Finnlandon.<P>
En Nordio ekzistas longa tradicio, ke iuj oficialaj dokumentoj
principe estas publikaj. Plej malsekretemas Svedio, kie ajna
homo rajtas viziti iun oficialan instancon, peti liston de la
tiutagaj potaoj kaj laplae legi ajnan alvenintan leteron.<P>
Finnlando is nun ne multe postrestis en malsekretemo. Tamen
rilate diversajn EU-dokumentojn la situacio estas zorgiga. Dum
Svedio estas forte kritikata de EU-instancoj pro sia ekstreme
malsekretema sinteno, en Finnlando dokumentoj pri ankora ne
isfine traktitaj aferoj estas malfacile haveblaj, a tute ne
riceveblaj, kiel konstatis urnalisto, kiu sendis pli ol tridek
faksmesaojn al pluraj ministrejoj petante diversajn dokumentojn.<P>
Lige kun la venontjara registara EU-konferenco, laborgrupo
preparas proponon pri pliigo de publikeco e EU-instancoj. Tiam
Finnlando, kune kun Svedio kaj Danio, subtenos malsekretemon, sed
enlande la EU-alio is nun kazis plian sekretumadon.<P>

<H2><I>Orienta brando senlaborigas</I></H2>
Spite la novajn limigojn, enkondukitajn de la finna dogano, la
vendoj en la tataj alkohol-vendejoj en sud-orienta Finnlando
restas malmultaj. Dum la lastaj jaroj multaj uzantoj de fortaj
trinkaoj komencis aeti siajn botelojn en Rusio, kaj la novaj
import-reguloj, kiuj ekvalidis pro la alio al EU, e pli
faciligas la importadon de malmultekostaj alkoholaoj por propra
uzo.<P>
Jam komenciis sindikata traktado pri malpliigo de la laborantoj
en alkohol-vendejoj proksime al la rusa limo. En la vendejoj
laboras irka 70 personoj, sed oni klopodos eviti eksigojn.
Anstatae oni verajne igos kelkajn tuttempajn postenojn
partatempaj, kaj malpliigos la dungadon de anstataantoj.<P>
Post kiam la import-reguloj aniis en la printempo, la vendoj
de alkoholo en kelkaj vendejoj en la sud-oriento malpliiis je 30
elcentoj. La dara malpliio ajnas ii pli ol 10 elcentoj.
Brando kostas en Finnlando dekoble pli ol en Rusio.<P>
Anka la butikumado de rusoj en Finnlando lastatempe pliiis,
kvankam la rusoj certe ne aetas brandon. En kelkaj elimaj urboj
jam eblas ani rusajn rublojn al finnaj markoj, kaj nun kelkaj
vendejoj e komencis akcepti rublojn.<P>

ajnis preska certe, ke la nova efministro de Svedio nomios
Mona Sahlin. La afero tamen aniis, kiam urnalo malkais, ke
la nuna socialdemokrata vic-efministro multfoje uzis la
kreditkarton de sia labordonanto (do, de la tato), pagante per
i privatajn aetojn kaj e luante aton dum libertempo.<P>
S-ino Sahlin asertis, ke i nur ``pruntis'' monon el sia sekva
salajro, kaj cetere kutime repagis al la tato, anta ol la
kreditkarta firmo fakturis la aetojn. Tamen oni malkovris, ke
kelkajn aetojn i repagis nur, kiam la amaskomunikiloj
ekinteresiis pri la afero.<P>
Ne multe helpis, ke oni poste malkovris similajn - kvankam malpli
gravajn - pekojn anka e aliaj tataj dungitoj, inkluzive
ministrojn de la antaa, bura registaro. Oni jam ekigis juejan
enketon.<P>
E se Sahlin evitos leajn sekvojn, restos la fakto, ke multaj
svedoj opinias, ke ne povas ii efministro homo, kiu ne kapablas
ordigi sian propran ekonomion a fari diferencon inter propra
mono kaj tiu apartenanta al la tato. Mankas tamen ankora nova
kandidato, kiu povus okupi la postenon de la nuna efministro
Ingvar Carlsson, kiam tiu printempe eksios kiel prezidanto de la
socialdemokrata partio kaj kiel efministro.<P>

Plej grandan anon koncerne devigan milit-servon en Argentino
okazigis la murdo de humila, religiema, 19-jara juna soldato
nekonata ekster la propra familio.<P>
Omar Carrasco [Karasko] eniris artilerian grupon en la provinco
Neuquen en marto 1994. Tri tagojn poste li malaperis: la armeo
anoncis lin dizertinto. Unu monaton poste troviis kadavro apud
la kazerno. Nekropsio rivelis, ke Carrasco mortis pro fortaj
batoj. La civila juisto, la kadavro estis kaita dum semajnoj
en neuzata regimenta necesejo, anta ol i malaperis el la
kazerno.<P>
Kolere reagis la argentina socio: oni memoris la rolon de
militistoj en puoj, malaperigado de homoj, turmentoj kaj aliaj
tiaj aferoj. Sekve efgeneralo Balza kondamnis oficiron kaj
suboficiron pro troaj perfortoj dum trejnado de Carrasco kaj liaj
samauloj. Tio tamen ne sufiis: finfine prezidanto Menem estis
devigita dekreti nuligon de milit-servo. Per nova leo instaliis
volontula servo.<P>
Intertempe komenciis en Neuquen publika proceso kontra kvar
armeanoj suspektindaj. Malkovrias tuta historio de mallumaj
faroj de militistoj. Malgra ,blankigo'-politiko de Balza,
lanita en majo 1995, la Carrasco-afero montras, ke ankora en la
armeo nestas malvirto kaj mensoguloj.<P>

<H3>NOV-ZELANDO</H3>
<H2><I>Nova sistemo ... u novaj rezultoj?</I></H2>
Okazos parlamentaj elektoj en Nov-Zelando la 12an de oktobro. La
elektoj estos la unuaj la novaj reguloj similaj al tiuj en
Germanio: temas pri miks-membra proporcia sistemo (MMP). La lando
dividiis en kvin maoriajn (indienajn) kaj 60 eneralajn
distriktojn. La aliaj 55 mandatoj en la 120-loka parlamento
distribuios la la proporcio de vooj ricevitaj de iu partio
inter kandidatoj, kies nomoj trovias en partiaj listoj. iu
vodonanto havas du voojn: unu por la distrikto kaj unu por la
preferata partio. Por gajni listmembrojn, partio devas venki en
almena unu distrikto a superi kvin elcentojn de la partiaj
vooj.<P>
En la lasta balotado, en 1993, la Nacia Partio gajnis plejmulton.
Poste i perdis mandatojn kaj nun dependas de ses membroj de la
nova Unuigita Partio, kiu konsistas el eksmembroj de la du efaj
partioj (Nacia kaj Laborista Partioj). Opinio-sondoj indikas, ke
la Nacia Partio konservos subtenon, dum la Unuigita Partio eble
malaperos.<P>
La dua plej granda partio estis la Laborista Partio, kiu perdis
subtenon al Alianco de malgrandaj partioj (verduloj, maorioj, kaj
eksaj membroj de la laborista partio), kaj al nova partio
``Nov-Zelando Unue''. ia estro, Winston Peters [instan Pitaz],
eksministro de la Nacia Partio, instigis enketon ``Vinskatola
Afero'' (pro la ujo, en kiu li liveris dokumentojn al la
parlamento, kiam li akuzis komercistojn pri frado kaj
impostevitado en la pacifika insularo Cook [Kuk]). Li anka
instigis debaton pri enmigrado, opiniante, ke la registaro
enlasas tro da migrantoj.<P>
La Laborista Partio kaj la Alianco kritikas la registaron pro
aoso en la sanservoj kaj pro malbona prizorgado de maljunuloj.
Kostoj pliias kaj, kontraste al antaaj jaroj, kiam la tato
prizorgis maljunulojn labezone kaj senpage, i nun insistas, ke
oni pagu la kostojn de la propra prizorgado.<P>
La rezultoj de la elektoj publikios en la Tut-Tera Teksao
(TTT) de Interreto. Interesatoj pri la rezultoj povos alklaki
mapon de la lando por informii pri apartaj distriktoj. La
informon provizos kaj isdatigos la Oficejo por Balotoj en
Nov-Zelando.<P>

BELGIO-TURKIO: Kiu faris kion?
</H2>
En septembro la televidstacio de la kurda komunumo en Belgio MED
ricevis neanoncitan viziton de la belga polico, kiu konfiskis
plurajn dokumentojn kaj vidbendojn. Same okazis al la kurda azila
parlamento, kiu havas sian sidejon en Belgio. Diversaj personoj
estas arestitaj. La kulpigo tekstas: legaligo de droga-mono kaj
organizado de infan- kaj virin-komercado. Kompreneble amba aferoj
estas sufie tiklaj en la nuntempa Belgio.
<P>
Furiozias la kurda komunumo. Ili latvoe neas la akuzojn. La
ili la celo de la agado estas mutigi la kurdan kontraturkan
opozicion. Ili havas firman ateston pri tiu celo. Dum la somero
vizitis Turkion reprezentanto de la belga tatpolico, kiu
subskribis kunlabor-interkonsenton kun la turka sekreta polico.
La tatpolico kontradiras tiun klarigon. Ili neas, ke ekzistas iu
tia interkonsento kaj diras, ke ili havas klarajn indikojn, ke
ekzistas kontraleaj kaj e krimaj agadoj e la kurdoj
loantaj en Belgio.
<P>
Belga advokato, kiu reprezentas la kurdojn, tamen deklaris, ke
la saman scenaron uzis la polico anta du jaroj. Ili invadis la
oficejojn de la kurda komunumo, konfiskis la kontlibrojn kaj
faris profundan enketon, sed povis pruvi nenion. La tuta afero
daris plurajn monatojn sed havis neniun rezulton. Finfine i
estis silente kaj kviete nuligita. Nun denove ili
agas sammaniere, asertante, ke ili havas novajn pruvojn, sed
fakte io bazias sur la samaj suspektigoj de anta du jaroj.

<H3>ZAIRIO</H3>
<H2><I>Plej ria provinco</I></H2>
Katanga, nun Shaba [aba], ajnas la plej ria provinco de
Zairio. La provinco kreas pro siaj minejoj preska 60 % de la
nacia bueto. La minejoj ekspluatiis unue dum la koloniaj jaroj,
kiam ministoj rekrutiis el inter kasaianoj, el la provinco Kasai en
sud-orienta Zairio. Katanganoj kredeble ne atis manlaboron.<P>
Tamen lastatempe, sub la diktatoreco de Mobutu, dekretiis, ke la
provincestroj provizore devenu de la provinco mem. Do kiam nova
estro Kyungu, katangano, enposteniis, li komencis maldungi
kasaianojn. La Kyungu, nur katanganoj devos respondeci pri la
katanga industrio. Ekis sanga etna milito, dum kiu multaj
kasaianoj mortis kaj pli ol miliono devis reveni al Kasai.
Kasaianoj fariis rifuantoj en la provinco, kie ili dum jaroj
vivis. Tamen la milito frakasis la enprovincan industrion,
inkluzive de la minejoj, kaj minacis faligi la zairian ekonomion.<P>
Finfine Mobutu siavice faligis Kyungu-on, kiu - kvankam populara
- mem riiis. Provincestroj, por krei unuecan taton, nun
devenas de alia provinco ol la propra. Tiel realias la revo de
Mobutu: paralizi la ekonomion, ar malria popolo -- la la
politikistoj -- ne povas kontra-registare militi.<P>

<H3>AFRIKO</H3>
<H2><I>Voo el la pasinto</I></H2>
Sian prezidento-kandidation en la venontjaraj elektoj en Zairio,
Afriko, anoncis Alberto Ndele, ekonomikisto kaj politikisto, kiu
siatempe luktis por la sendependio de la iama Kongolo de la
koloniisma potenco Belgio.<P>
Ndele, poste dum 16 jaroj ekzilita pro opozicio kontra la
politiko de la nuna prezidento Mobutu, dum sia politika kariero
naciigis en 1966 la plej grandan minejan kompanion en Zairio, la
Union Minejan de Alta Katango, kiu is tiam restis en la manoj de
belgoj. En 1967, kiel estro de la centra banko, li iniciatis
gravajn financajn reformojn. Tamen en 1975, jam ekzilita, li
estis akuzita pro fuita puo kontra la registaro, kaj iujn liajn
posedaojn konfiskis la prezidento Mobutu.<P>
Nbele anoncis sian kandidation je la 30a de junio, la tago de
datreveno de la sendependio de Zairio. Li indikis, ke la popolo
petis lian kandidation, kaj li postulis kvin jarojn por
rekonstrui Zairion detruitan pro la politiko de Mobutu. Li
apelaciis al la popolo ja vodoni kaj ne bojkoti la elektojn kaj
kune konsideri, kiel plej efike solvi la problemojn alfrontatajn
de la lando. Tiucele estiis movado de nacia rekonstruo, kies
prezidanto estas Ndele.<P>

<H2><I>Por ofta kunfoliumado</I></H2>
En la marta numero de <I>MONATO</I> aperis <A HREF="003838.html">
recenzo de Gramatika ABC-mempraktikilo</A>,
kompilita de Christiane De Vleminck kaj Emile
Van Damme, eldonita e Flandra Esperanto-Ligo (FEL). La
mempraktikilo estis konsilata por ofta trafoliumado, opiniata
bona, utila kolekto por ekzerci nian nefacilan lingvon. Nun
aperis la dua ero de la serio, samforma kaj samaspekta
ABC-Gramatiko de Esperanto, verkita de la menciitaj atoroj. Ne
nur la eksteraoj, sed plie anka la enhavo kaj strukturo aludas
al parenceco.<P>
Kiu provis jam foje ne nur rigardi iun konkretan gramatikaon,
sed vere profunde trastudi nian PAG (Plena Analiza Gramatiko de
Kalocsay kaj Waringhien), certe bone komprenas la diferencon kaj
kun granda ojo bonvenigas la novan, similtaskan gramatiklibron.
Anstata timige densa kaj "peza" libro, malfacile digesteblaj
gramatikaj paragrafoj, la nuna ABC-Gramatiko estas simpla,
travidebla, tamen sufie kompleta manlibro. Anstata longaj
difinoj kaj klarigoj la problemojn prezentas frapaj ekzemploj,
bone eligitaj anka grafike; kontrakolumne difinoj, konvinkaj
pruvoj klarigas ilin, referencoj indikas al aliaj, koncernaj
apitroj. La materialo estas aranita laalfabete. Orientii
eblas la temoj en la enhavtabelo kaj anka la problemoj kaj
terminoj helpe de la librofina indekso.<P>
La pli ampleksajn temojn la apitroj pritraktas en subgrupoj.
Plano-j orientige helpas komence de la prezentado; resumo-j
donas superrigardon post la detalaj, multflankaj demonstradoj;
rimarko-j atentigas, pensigas, klopodas konvinki pri la normaleco
de ajnaj neregulaoj; kaj la tuton teksas la homeca alirmaniero,
anstata akademia "lingvistikumado". Renkontante iun problemon,
trovante plurajn, kontradirajn solvojn en nia "netuebla"
gramatiko oni ofte seras pruvojn en PAG, neglektante iun tute
naturan fenomenon: la evoluon de la lingvo, la influon de la
parolantoj.<P>
Krom la menciitaj pozitivaj trajtoj estas granda
virto de la ABC-Gramatiko, ke i ne nur kuraas mencii kaj analizi
la tiklajn demandojn, sed entreprenas la respondecon direkti la
leganton, sen altrudi iun kaj kondamni la alian solvon.
Prezentante la diversajn manierojn i proponas oran mezan vojon
inter la ekstreme kontrastaraj tendencoj kaj skoloj
(radikkarakteroj, vortfarado, po-demando...). <P>
Per tiu i nova verko nia armilaro riiis je faklibro, kies
enhavo bone kunfandas la preskriban kaj la priskriban karakterojn
de la gramatiko. La teorian materialon, pli ol 200-paan enhavon
bone kompletigas kaj pere de samstrukturaj ekzercoserioj
enprofundigas la pli frue eldonita ABC-mempraktikilo. La
libro-duopo certe farios populara apogilo ne nur inter la
lingvo-instruantoj kaj mem- a kun-lernantoj, sed anka en la
manoj de iu konscia Esperanto-parolanto.<P>

<H2><I>Engluti dum unu vespero,<P>
digesti dum dek du semajnoj</I></H2>
Tiu i dua konsilaro por aktivuloj estas laborlibro. Ni komencu
per ia malavantao: ne eblas post tralego transdoni in al iu
alia, ar i estos jam plenskribita de vi. Ja ne sufias lerni
principojn. Plani sian tempon estas lerteco kaj sinteno, kiun oni
alproprigu al si. Tio ne eblas en unu vespero, kiel la enkonduko
asertas. Jes, eblas tralegi la tuton en unu vespero. Poste,
tamen, oni bezonos dek du semajnojn por proprigi al si iun el
la apitroj, kies numeroj estas signitaj per la horoj sur
ciferplato. Jen nur unu detalo de la optimuma uzado de enpaigo,
desegnetoj kaj litertipoj.<P>
La plej utila estas uzado de kernvortoj sur mareno apud la
teksto. Ili permesas poste per rapida rigardo rememori la enhavon
de la pao: tio parigos al vi tempon. La enhavo estas klara,
facile komprenebla kaj kun multaj ekzemploj kaj sloganoj. Tamen,
pro la sprita stilo, la teksto neniam ias instrueca a teda.
Cetere, mi ne trovis preserarojn, kvankam mi devas konfesi, ke mi
ne perdis tempon por aktive seri ilin.<P>
Anta pluraj jaroj mi sekvis dutagan kurson pri tempoplanado.
Same kiel tiam, anka en i tiu libreto oni reklamas pri la<I>
Time/system</I> (multekosta) notlibro, ofte uzata de profesiaj
vendistoj kaj simile okupitaj homoj. La mia sperto, samgrade
utilas normala notlibro, se oni nur diligente kaj konsekvence (=
temo de la apitro 12) uzas in. Unu averto: la libro ne instruas
kiel fari pli multe en la sama tempospaco (por tio legu,
ekzemple, libron pri rapida legado), sed vi, jes, lernos, kiel
fari la plej gravajn taskojn.<P>
La enhavo de tiu i modesta aboco sufias por iu
Esperanto-parolanto, kiu ``ne havas sufie da tempo, kvankam iu
havas iom da tempo, kiom ekzistas''.<BR>

<H2><I>Diverskvalita erotiko</I></H2>
<I>Antologio de amoro</I> estas miksao de iom da poezio, kelkaj
eseetoj, unu teatrao (dialogo) kaj kelkaj mucidaj ercoj
verkitaj a tradukitaj de tri ``renomaj'' atoroj: Karma Sutro,
Karna Voro kaj Tange Koiti.<P>
Kiel la titolo suspektigas, io temas pri amorado iom bizara. En
``Stireja regalo'' pimpa kaj flulinia blondulino devigas la piloton
de fluganta aviadilo iom ``okupii pri i''. Li altas la
atomatan piloton kaj hup hup, is kvin minutojn anta la
surterio, ili, nu, vi scias ja.<P>
La teatrao temas pri simila travivao inter viro kaj virino.
Bedarinde, mi estas unu el tiuj, kiuj ne atas <I>legi</I> teatraojn.
Mi preferas <I>vidi </I>ilin surscenigitaj. Mi do avide atendas
Esperanto-kongreson, en kiu mi povos ui in.<P>
``Sekso en Tahitio'' estas scienca verketo pri la erotika vivo de
la ``vahinoj'', la virinoj en Tahitio. Se io, kio trovias en la
eseo, estas vera, estas tute kompreneble, ke Paul Gauguin uste
tie kreis siajn plej fascinajn pentraojn.<P>
Se pri la prozaoj mi estas duone pozitiva, pri la poeziaetoj mi
ne deziras multe komenti. Jen tipa strofo:<P>
<PRE>
Ve, tro malakris mia glavo
por tuj atingi al la kavo.
Kun kisoj ardantaj al buo
do i sin relokis sen fuo
elpalpis mane mian klingon,
la pinton metis en la ingon.
Kaj kun malfermitaj l' okuloj
kaj kun malfermitaj la kruroj.
(el<I> La Bapto de Karna Voro</I>)

Kaj la neprao por iu vera antologio:<P>
<PRE>
En la liton venis nova sento
tra la lito iras sora tremo ...

atantoj de bildrakontoj ne estas dorlotataj en Esperantujo. La

<H2><I>Kiu sekvos?</I></H2>
Sian enkondukon al la libro ``Nederlanda bibliografio'' (1972)
William Auld finis per la jenaj frazoj: ``Ni estas dankaj al la
kompilinto. Mi estas certa, ke li aldonos sian voon al la mia,
kiam mi demandas: kiu sekvos?'' u en tiu jaro 1972 Auld jam
sciis, ke li mem (kune kun Edmund Grimley Evans) sekvos per
``Bibliografio de tradukoj el la angla lingvo''?<P>
La us aperinta bibliografio enhavas referencojn al iom pli ol
2000 tradukoj el la angla en Esperanton. u tiuj 2000 konsistigas
la tutan aron da aperintaj tradukoj? Nu, certe ne. Ja neniu
bibliografio estas kompleta. En tiu i mi ekzemple vane seris la
poemon ``La nesekvita vojo'' de Robert Frost, kiun delikate
tradukis Krys Ungar (Meznokto metropola, FEL, 1991, pao 67), kaj
certe estos troveblaj ankora aliaj.<P>
Iom bedarinde estas, ke la verkoj estas ordigitaj nur la la
nomoj de la atoroj. Se vi volus scii, kiujn titolojn tradukis
Auld a Boulton a Goodheir, vi devus trafoliumi la tutan
53-paan libreton. (La jam citita ``Nederlanda bibliografio''
enhavas listojn la atoroj, tradukintoj, titoloj kaj la
libroj/revuoj en kiuj ili aperis.) Aldono de malgranda komputila
disketo al la libro jam grandparte solvus tiajn serproblemojn.<P>
Malgra tiuj du kritiketoj la libro - la rezulto de granda
sizifa laboro - meritas iajn ladojn kaj apogojn.<BR>

<H2><I>eo antologias brazile</I></H2>
Francisko Valdomiro Lorenz, naskiinta en iama Bohemujo en 1872,
apartenas al unuahoraj esperantistoj. Jam en 1890 li verkis kaj
proprakoste publikigis lernolibron por eoj. Elmigrinte al
Brazilo en 1893, li darigis sian poresperantan agadon malgra
ega okupiteco, komence baraktante kiel terkulturisto por subteni
sian familion kaj adoptitajn idojn, poste kiel instruisto,
multtema verkisto kaj multlingva tradukisto.<P>
Rilate nian lingvon, li in propagandis, instruis, verkis
gazetartikolojn, lernolibrojn por poloj kaj portugaloj, poetis
kaj kiel poligloto tradukis el 40 lingvoj la libron <I>Diverskolora
Bukedeto</I>, el la sanskrita la verkon <I>Bhagavad-Gita </I>kaj el la
portugala i tiun <I>Brazila antologio poezia</I>, kiu entenas 324
poeziaojn de 120 poetoj ekde la 17a is la nuna jarcento.<P>
Anka i tiu antologio atestas pri giganta laborkapablo de
Lorenz, pri lia senfina pacienco, kiam li penis fidele redoni la
metrikon kaj rimskemon de la originaloj. Ni, tamen, konsideru, ke
Lorenz estis poeto de la pionira sed ne de la nuna periodo.<P>
Se li isvivus nian tempon, li, evidente, farus zorgan revizion
de i tiuj tradukoj por obei al la nunaj pli striktaj reguloj de
la lingvo, forigante kunfandon de adjektivo + substantivo
(ekzemple, <I>sekfolioj</I>), nenormalan vortordon, kiel mislokigon de
la artikolo pro la metriko (ekzemple, <I>entilaj la fralinoj</I>) kaj
speciale adasismojn.<P>
Por plene aprezi la valoron de i tiuj tradukoj, ni devas legi
ilin kun la sama aperta spirito, kun kiu ni legas poeziajn
verkojn de niaj ceteraj pioniroj en <I>Fundamenta Krestomatio</I>.<BR>

<H2><I>ina ceramika historio</I></H2>
La libro <I>ina ceramiko </I>prezentas la historion de la ceramika arto
en inio de anta 11 200 jaroj is la nuntempo. Tiel i servas
kiel enkonduko al la teknika kaj estetika disvolvio de unu el la
plej gravaj kulturaj kontribuaoj de inio. Ilustras la tekston
multaj desegnaoj kaj fotografaoj kaj anka dek kvin bildpaoj,
plejparte koloraj, montrantaj efverkojn de inaj ceramikistoj.<P>
Dokumentado pri la historio de la ina ceramiko trovias en
antikvaj libroj pritraktantaj la historion de diversaj dinastioj.
Arkeologoj ofte alfrontas la problemon lokalizi la precizan situon
de bakujoj menciitaj en tiuj malnovaj verkoj. En la pasinteco
ekzistis du specoj de bakujoj, civilaj kaj tataj. i-lastaj
estis destinitaj produkti porcelanaojn ekskluzive por la imperiestra
palaco kaj tatoficistaj domoj. Male, la civilaj bakujoj, kiuj
kelkfoje estis kontrolitaj de tatoficisto, ne konkurencis kontra
la tataj entreprenoj sed, povante eviti malpermesojn kaj leojn
de la regantoj, estis liberaj dedii sin al pli kreiva produktado.<P>
Dekomence la atoro priskribas la disvolvion de ceramika teknologio
en inio kun rilato al ekspluatado de krudmaterialoj, teknikoj
formi kaj baki ceramikajn objektojn kaj eksperimentoj akiri estetike
altkvalitajn kolorigilojn kaj glazurojn. Poste estas prezentita
la evoluo de la ceramika arto enkadre de la sinsekvo de dinastioj
kaj la produktado de apartaj bakujoj en iu periodo. inaj
ceramikaoj inkludas ne nur vazojn, potojn, bovlojn kaj telerojn
por enteni kaj kuiri nutraojn sed anka vastan gamon da aliaj
objektoj kun diversaj uzoj, inter kiuj estas entombigitaj funebraj
oferaoj, arkitekturaj argilaoj (tegment-tegoloj, brikoj kaj
akvotuboj), skulptitaj figuretoj de homoj kaj bestoj, ludiloj,
kapkusenoj kaj muzikiloj. Multaj ceramikaoj estas kolore ornamitaj
per ideo-grafiaoj, geometriaj figuroj, kaj bildoj de fioj,
vegetaoj, homaj vizaoj kaj dancantaj homoj. Kontribuis al
la beligo de inaj ceramikaoj glazuroj kun plej malsamaj kemiaj
konsistoj.<P>
La produktado de porcelano, kiu estas unu el la grandaj inventaoj
de inio, komenciis anta pli ol 1800 jaroj. En postaj
jarcentoj porcelanaoj fariis la plej grava eksport-varo de
la lando. En la okcidento granda aro de rompopecoj elfositaj
de arkeologoj atestas, ke inaj porcelanaoj atingis Hindion,
Irakon kaj Egipton la 15 000-kilometra komerca vojo. Porcelanaj
ujoj rolis anka en la komerco inter inio kaj Japanio. ipo,
kiu dronis apud Koreio inter 1310-1325 estis plenarita per
celadonverdaj kaj verdeblankaj porcelanaoj. Tre informriaj
estas la lastaj du apitroj, kiuj temas pri la nuntempa ceramika
industrio en inio kaj la industria kaj medicina uzo de ceramikaoj,
kelkaj en la formo de kunmetaoj kun aliaj substancoj, kiuj donas
al ili novajn proprecojn.<P>
Malgra la celo de la atoro prezenti en kompakta formo la tutan
historion de la ceramika arto en inio, oni ne povas utiligi
tiun i verkon kiel enciklopedieton a kiel gvidlibron okaze
de vizito al muzeo por pliampleksigi tekstojn de etikedoj sur
ekspoziciitaj objektoj. Posedanto de<I> ina Ceramiko</I> dare sentas
frustron pro la neeblo facile kaj rapide trovi referencojn al
specifaj temoj, ar mankas indeksoj. Post la unua lego de la
libro estas necese transturni multajn paojn anta ol oni povos
denove trovi seratan nomon a terminon.<P>
La teksto estas plena de dekoj, eble centoj, da loknomoj rilatantaj
al ceramika produktado (regionoj, provincoj, gubernioj, prefektujoj,
municipoj, urboj, vilaoj, metiejoj kaj arkeologiaj trovlokoj),
sed leganto ne havas eblon eliri el tiu labirinto, ar ne estas
unu sola mapo (prefere serio da mapoj) por orientio. Ne nur
estas neeble akiri bonan bildon pri la spaca disvolvio de ceramika
produktado en inio; uzantoj de la libro trovas sin en same nebuleca
situacio rilate la historian dimension kaj perdias en kronologia
nenieslando inter nomoj de imperiestroj, regantoj, tatoficistoj
kaj atoroj de antikvaj verkoj pro manko de tabeloj resumantaj
la politikan historion de inio (epokoj, periodoj, dinastioj
kaj nomoj de regantoj kun la datoj de la daro de ilia reg-periodo).
Anka bezonata estas kronologia tabelo de arkeologiaj kulturoj
en inio kun datoj kaj regionoj de disvolvio. Malestas anka
nomindekso havanta iujn person- kaj lok-nomojn kun indiko de
la prononco per la Esperanto-alfabeto. Nemalhavebla estas temindekso
listiganta iujn teknikajn terminojn kaj specojn de ceramikaoj.
Fine, glosaro estas necesa por klarigi la signifon de multaj inaj
vortoj kaj anka Esperanto-esprimoj, kiuj ne estas kompreneblaj
e en kunteksto, ekzemple ``he-ipo'' kaj ``drak-bakujo''.<P>

<H2><I>Aetu grandskale...</I></H2>
``u vi adis ke...'' de Katalin Smidliusz estas floro inter la
kursolibroj. La frea kaj fina aspekto de la kajero tuj gajnas
fidon kaj scivolon. Trafoliumante in, oni renkontas pli ol 20
amuzajn historietojn, parte de la mano de la atorino, parte
elektitaj el <I>MONATO.</I> Spritaj rakontoj pri tigroj, muoj kaj bananoj
amuzas. Aliaj tekstoj instruas, foje pensigas, konsilas a avertas.
Tekstoj pri reklamado, horoskopo, k.a. garantias variecon. La lastaj
tekstoj estas pli longaj kaj elmontras sentemon kaj amon.<P>
Neniu el la tekstoj estas vere facila. Kontrae, kursanoj
devas atente legi ilin, se ili volas kompreni kaj memori ion. Ni
sekvu la strategion de la atorino. iun tekston akompanas du a
tri dekoj da demandoj. Ofte oni devas respondi nur per vero a
falso, sed aliaj testsistemoj anka abundas. Unu ekzemplo sufiu
por skizi la etoson (el la teksto ``Artema elefanto''): ``En iu
zooparko de Usono estigis grandan sensacion elefantino, kies
pentraoj famiis tiomgrade, ke oni anta nelonge organizis
ekspozicion el la bestaj verkoj. Testo: La zoologia ardeno
trovias en ...? a) la Unuiintaj tatoj de Nord-Ameriko; b) la
Unuiintaj Nacioj; c) la Soveta Unio; d) Unesko.<P>
La solvoj ne trovias tuj apude, kio estas bona afero. Evoluigo de
koncentriopovo kaj komprenkapablo ja estas doloriga okupo.<P>
Ekzistas anka sonkasedo, kiu enhavas la tekstojn. Askultinte du
fojojn specifan tekston, rigardu la teston. En tiu fazo decidu je
kiu parto vi devos pli atenteme koncentri vian atenton dum la sekva
askultado.<P>
Konkludo: Tute ne temas pri facila legolibro, kiu komencias per la
baza vortaro kaj iom post iom farias pli komplika. La celo de la
ekzercoj estas plibonigi vian komprenkapablon.<P>
La kajero plenigas truon en la Esperanto-merkato. Mi aetigos ``u
vi adis ke...'' grandskale por mia Esperanto-kurso. Ni tralaboros
kune iujn ekzercojn, kaj se fininte tiun i libron, ni ne sukcesos
tramai la marburgan manifeston, nenio vere helpos. Sed, i-foje mi
havas bonan esperon!<P>

Alironte t.n. ``Sciencan akton'', oni rajtas ektimi pri faka briko.
Tamen ``Enkonduko en la arton skribi'' tute malas: i estas tre
leera kajereto, unuspire legebla, neniel meritanta la titolon
``akto''.<P>
La atoro tuj avertas: La titolo misgvidas. Praktike la broureto
listigas nur baze bazajn konsilojn por verki urnalisme, kaj
atentas efe pri lingvo-stilo. Per tio Maul iomete kompletigas,
kvaza enkonduke, la trafajn observojn de sia samskolano Piron en
``Manlibro pri urnalismo''. Tial eblas sin demandi, u pli sperta
fakulo ne jam skribis tre simile pri la afero, kaj bedari, ke la
atoro ne profundigis la temojn, pri kiuj li ja atoritatas:
kiel dokumenti, organizi materialojn, strukturi artikolon, k.s.<P>
Verajne tiu i lekcio estis la unua el tuta kurso. Sola i estas
tro elementa kaj ne meritus publikigon. Nur se oni eldonus
kompletan lekciaron, tiu i enkonduko akirus ian intereson.<P>

<H2><I>Ludoj, sed ne tiuj</I></H2>
La teorio de ludoj ne estas, kiel oni povus supozi, teorio pri
ludoj de infanoj. Kaj la termino - lingva ludo - en la titolo ne
aludas al iuj vortludoj. Ne, la teorio de ludoj estas matematika
teorio, kies aplikoj nuntempe plejparte trovias en la ekonomiko.
i modeligas certan interagadon de du a pli ol du personoj, nome
se ili konkuras pri certaj mezureblaj bonaoj. i estis fondita
en 1944 de John von Neumann [on fon Nojman] kaj Oskar
Morgenstern [Morgentern], kaj nun estas bone evoluinta
matematika teorio kun miloj da publikigitaj artikoloj.<P>
Grava nocio en la teorio estas tiu de ekvilibro, precipe tiu de
stabila ekvilibro. Modelo strebas al stabila ekvilibro, kaj se
oni povas studi ties ecojn, oni ekhavas informon pri la estonta
stato de la modelo kaj e de la realo, se la matematika modelo
bone spegulas la ecojn de la realo.<P>
Reinhard Selten, ricevinto de la premio de la Sveda Nacia Banko
pri ekonomiko memore al Alfred Nobel, kaj Jonathan Pool [ona tan
Pul], konata politiksciencisto, verkis anta pluraj jaroj
libreton, kie ili aplikas la ludoteorion al la situacio de
lingvolernado. Ili faris tute seriozan studon per la metodoj de
la ludoteorio pri la problemo: u indas lerni Esperanton? La
Instituto pri kibernetiko nun eldonis in denove.<P>
La du atoroj desegnas situacion, en kiu la homaro posedas certan
nombron da naciaj lingvoj kaj unu lingvon, ekzemple Esperanton,
kiu estas nenies gepatra, sed kiun oni povas lerni kontra certa
peno a pago. Kaj uste tie ni renkontas tipan nocion en la
teorio de ludoj: la ludantoj pagas kaj gajnas iun bonaon, kaj
ili iuj strebas maksimumigi sian gajnon. En la modelo de la
libro la sola gajno estas la frakcio de la homaro, kun kiu oni
povas interkomuniki, do kun kiu oni havas almena unu komunan
lingvon, u denaskan, u lernitan. Sekve, se iuj lernas
Esperanton (a la eskan), iuj povas interkomuniki kaj iuj
havas maksimuman gajnon. La pago, male, estas la peno kiun oni
spertas lernante lingvon.<P>
Estas tipa trajto de la matematika teorio, ke la pago por lerni
lingvon devas esti pozitiva. En la modelo oni ne povas toleri
lernanton, kiu uas lerni iujn lingvojn, ar se oni farus tion,
tiu lernanto lernus iujn lingvojn de la mondo. Tio signifas, ke
maleblas la situacio, en kiu iuj lernas du-tri lingvojn pro la
uo fari tion, sed ne povas lerni mil; tia modelo estus
nelineara. Kaj uste tie kuas grava limigo de la aplikeblo de la
modelo.<P>
La atoroj tre zorge gvidas nin en la modelon, konsideras la
eblajn strategiojn de lingvolernado, kaj klarigas la nocion de
ekvilibro. Fine, en la lasta, sepa kaj plej matematika apitro,
ili zorge studas la distribuojn de lingvoj e la diversaj
ekvilibroj, kiuj povas ekzisti en la okazo, kie estas nur du
naciaj lingvoj. Kaj ili montras, kompreneble, ke en certaj kazoj
konsiderinda parto de la homaro, jes ja, lernos Esperanton. Sed
u la kondioj por tia ekvilibro estas plenumitaj? Tion ili ne
diras, kompreneble, ar tio ne estas ilia tasko.<P>
La libro origine aperis nur en Esperanto. Nun oni provizis in
per germana traduko (modela, la mia kompreno, ie, kie mi
kontrolis), kiu aperas sampae kun la Esperanta originalo. i
havas anka ampleksajn resumojn en la lingvoj Esperanto, germana,
angla, franca, itala kaj pola, bibliografion, indekson, kaj, ne
malplej interese, biografiojn de la du atoroj en Esperanto kaj
la germana. Pro la multlingveco la libro estas pli ampleksa ol
ia efa teksto, kiu okupas nur iom pli ol kvardek plenajn
paojn.<P>
Mi opinias la libron bona lernolibro, se oni volas kompreni unu
ludoteorian modelon, la analizon de la kondioj por ekvilibroj
kaj ties stabilecon. i do havas gravan signifon por popularigo
de tiu matematika teorio: la atoroj estas gratulindaj. Sed mi ne
vere kredas, ke oni povas lerni ion pri ancoj de Esperanto en la
reala mondo ... kaj mi dubas, u la atoroj mem opinias tiel.<BR>

``Kiuj uzas vortarojn de sinonimoj?'' demandis mia edzino, vidante
la duan korektitan eldonon de la vortareto de Jaan Ojalo. Mi
respondis, ke mi supozas - lernantoj, poetoj, beletristoj,
urnalistoj, ktp. Tamen, la postuloj de lernantoj, unuflanke, kaj
de verkistoj, aliflanke, estas malsamaj. Kredeble lernantoj, kiuj
ne havas rimedojn por akiri multekostan PIVon, trovos i tiun
vortareton ne senutila, kvankam mi dubas, u ili ofte bezonos
sinonimojn de meleagreno, armoracio a ciklostomoj. Se en tia
verko oni volas inkludi sciencan nomenklaturon, la kompilanto
devas decidi, u li provu enmeti iujn, a nur kelkajn. Kiam li
ne sekvas liston de la plej ofte uzata terminaro, la elekto ias
hazarda.<P>
Ojalo, en sia antaparolo, klarigas, ke i tiu vortaro estas unua
provo, ``kiu ne strebadas esti matura kaj perfekta''. Li invitas
``proponojn por korektado kaj pliperfektigo''. Mi havas kelkajn:
Kial en tiel malgranda kolekto inkludi ekzotaojn kiel
``flambergo'', ``bakiso'', ``babuo'', ``ardo'', ``pastlo'' (?), sed
preterlasi pli komunajn kapvortojn? --- Kial ne indiki sinonimojn
por variigi la monotonecon de konstante ripetataj vortetoj, kiel
``kaj'', ``sed'', ``tamen''? --- Ekonomiistoj rajtas demandi, u sufias
la difino ``monopolo --- privilegio'' (kial ne ``akaparado'',
``kartelo'', ``trusto'', el kiuj la du lastaj ja aperas sub aliaj
numeroj). --- ``Kanelo de rabo'' ne estas la sola, nek la plej
kutima signifo de relo. Mi rimarkis malmulte da eraroj. Negrava
estas ``pej'' anstata ``plej'' (p. 18, n-ro 515). ``Vertebro'' ne
estas ``spinostaro'', sed ``spinosto'', ``spinero''.<P>
Mi verajne ne aetus la libron, ar mi opinias ian
amplekson kaj vortelekton tro limigitaj. Kiam mi ne volas perdi
tempon serante sinonimojn en masiva PIV, mi kutimas konsulti la
vortaron de M. C. Butler, kie, ignorante la anglajn analogojn,
oni trovas sinonimojn, avertojn pri ``falsaj amikoj'', kaj
internacian nomenklaturon. Malgra tio, la vortareto prezentas la
avantaon, ke i kostas multe malpli, kaj certe estos praktika
ilo por enerala uzado.<P>

Vestu vin Esperante</H2>
Tiu modesta 10-paa vortlisto kaas trezoron
nemalhaveblan por iu Esperanto-parolanto. Kiu el ni ne
stumblis pro senpera manko de vorto por objekto iutageca? La
kompilintoj listigis ne nur vestojn, sed ion meteblan sur la
korpon. Ekzemploj estas memklarigaj kaj ofte amuzaj: savjako,
rulsketilo, pohorloo, insigno, ameterna ringo, adaparato,
pantalonfendo, duona orpundo (!), laroj, filakterio, gipsa
bandao, sekskailo, monoklo, kondomo.
<P>
Kvankam iuj homoj portas vestojn, kaj multaj vestoj estas
vaste konataj, tamen iuj specifaj vestoj estas nomitaj en la
listo: bikinkalsono, kaftano, segista jako, pelta
husarapelo, turkastela gvardiapelo. Specifaj kaj naciaj
vestoj estas malfacile nomeblaj en Esperanto. Unuflanke, oni
povas prunte preni (hm! stranga esprimo: se oni ion prenas
prunte, oni devas iam redoni in, sed la lingvoj tion ne
faras) nacian nomon; aliflanke, bonvenas klarsencaj kombinoj de
ekzistantaj vortoj. La kompilintoj uzas amba metodojn,
donante preferon al la dua. Mi ne povas deteni min de la tento
citi longetan liston de trafaj vortkombinaj nomoj: kurta
trumpeto a duontrumpeto, nodotinkturita kapotuko,
sportjako a blazero, migroboteto, plandumarko, laborkitelo,
nuretpunto, senelka bankostumo, izolganto, matrosa
pulovero, toluo, bulkvasto, ultrovatao, femurboto, vintra
sortimento, irkavolva jupo, [rusa] pelta orelumapo.
<P>
Trafaj estas anka kelkaj esprimoj ligitaj kun la temo
``Vestoj'': bone sidi (pri vestoj), harmonii (kun io),
torsnuda, surprovi (ion), surhavi (ion), ekstradelikata,
modospektaklo.
<P>
Tamen ne io listigita povas esti klara por iuj, ekzemple:
boata dekolto, ornamita oksfordo, trikota recepto, supertuniko.
<P>
ar la listo estas angla-Esperanta, i ebligas vidi, ke
iufoje Esperanto estas pli klara ol naciaj lingvoj. Ekzemple,
al la angla <I>jacket</I> respondas la Esperantaj jako,
aketo, jaketo; al la angla <I>coat</I> respondas la
Esperantaj jako, surtuto, mantelo, palto.
<P>
Jen kelkaj diskutindaoj. Al la neinternacia
<I>kordurojo</I> mi preferus la internacian kaj
registritan en vortaroj velveto-n. La <I>mikrojupo</I>
asociias por mi kun io videbla nur per mikroskopo, do apena
portebla por kovri la koncernan parton de la korpo. u ne
sufius jupeto, mallonga a kurta jupo?
<P>
Anta iom da tempo en la interreta diskutforumo
<I>soc.culture.esperanto</I> kelkaj anglalingvanoj (!)
ege oponis la uzadon de la vortoj <I>dezajno, -i</I>,
donante preferon al <I>fasono, -i</I>. Nu, ajnas al mi,
ke la kompilintoj de la listo prave uzas amba vortojn kun iom
diversaj sencoj.
<P>
Kaj ankora pri la speco de pantalono portata en la tuta
mondo, kiu estas konata sub la angla nomo <I>blue
jeans</I>. Tiu i listo nomas in inso. Ne neante
tagecon de tiu varianto, same kiel de kelkaj aliaj (inzo,
inzo, bluino k.a.), mi preferas la formon <I>inso</I>, ar la
Esperanta tradicio e alpreno de angladevenaj vortoj preferas
skriban similecon al la sona.
<P>
La utilon de la listo mi vidas por iu deziranto flue paroli
pri iutagaoj, por vortaristoj kaj por ... perfektiantoj
en la angla lingvo (kial Esperanto ne plenumu la gravan
funkcion de helpilo por studado de fremdaj lingvoj?!).

<H2><I>Floroj sen suko</I></H2>
Ni komencu per atentigo pri tri gravaj virtoj de tiu i tria
krimromano de Sero Elgo, <I>La floroj de l' krepusko</I>. Unue, la baza
intrigo, la skemo de la rakonto, estas simpla, relative kredinda
kaj ankrita en la 1980aj jaroj. Tro da aliaj krimromanoj paneas,
venkitaj de sia intriga labirinto. Due, en tiuj partoj de la
romano, kie okazas la agado mem, Elgo sukcese enscenigas
la eventojn, donante al la leganto eksciton kaj streon. Trie, la
lingvo, enerale, estas bona, klara kaj sen strangaoj.<P>
En la romano teroristoj nebulcelaj kaj nebulcerbaj planas kaj
plenumas atencojn, kaj estas asataj de la polico per sufie
maltrafaj metodoj. Enmiksias universitatanoj ne tre praktikemaj,
virinoj belaj kaj mal-, viroj idealismaj kaj mal-. io okazas en
nedifinita okcident-eropa lando, kiu iom similas Francion.<P>
Kompare kun sia unua romano<I> ia lasta potkarto</I> de 1988, Elgo
tamen i-foje retropais. En <I>ia... </I>li disvolvas la intrigon
detale, lerte kaj celkonscie, dum en<I> La floroj... </I>lame kaj
distrite. En <I>ia...</I> la socia tendenco de Elgo (pri klasoj,
politiko, interseksaj rilatoj, ktp.) esprimias efe kiel natura
parto de la rakonto, dum en<I> La floroj...</I> i aperas kiel predikoj,
kiuj krome ne tre bone kongruas kun la personoj kaj situacioj, en
kiujn li trudis ilin.<P>
La medioj kaj personoj e Elgo ofte impresas iom pale, sensuke.
Se mi komparas liajn rolulojn kun aliaj konatoj el la krima mondo
esperanta, tiuj lastaj ofte estas pli interesaj. La dialogoj kaj
personaj karakteroj de Ksavero Kant kaj aliaj (Deck Dorval), la
medio kaj metodeco de Jano Karal kun edzino (Joh&#225;n Valano), la
agoj kaj sentoj de Danny Skagen (Istv&#225;n Nemere) ombras
inspektoron Kramer kaj aliajn en la verko de Elgo. En <I>La floroj
de l' krepusko</I> la dialogoj ne impresas tre vive kaj nature, la
romankomenco ne tuj kaptas la leganton, la fino ajnas iom
melodrama kaj amatora.<P>
Kiam Elgo dumtempe forgesas sian idean mision kaj ekrulas
eventojn kaj agojn de siaj protagonistoj, la romano tamen ekvivas
kaj povas teni la intereson de leganto. Al la legontoj tial
direndas: ne hontu foliumi preter la predikoj por plene ui la
eventojn de la romano!<BR>

<H2><I>El kolza kampo</I></H2>
Ne necesas esti romkatoliko por ui la poezion de Dante, nek
puritano por ui la poezion de Milton. Poezio estas pli universala
ol dogmoj kaj, kiam sukcesa, ampleksas nian komunan homecon.
Ne necesas esti samseksemulo por ui la poemojn en tiu i geja
antologio. Kaj uindaj ili estas. Mi vere kaj agrable surpriziis
pri la konstanta alta kvalito de la elektitaj verkoj. La volumo
ampleksas poemojn originalajn kaj tradukitajn.<P>
Unuavice gravas la originalaj. Kontribuis 14 poetoj (du el ili
anonimaj). Plej multverke prezentias Benot Philippe, kaj tio
estas justa, ar li estas elstara talento. Li faris anka plurajn
el la tradukoj. e li oni trovas elvokive trafajn metaforojn,
figurojn kaj komparojn, kiel:<P>
<PRE>
... levias
odoro ura,
kvaza el kolza kampo
post batanta pluvo ...

Sed felie anka aliaj kontribuas bildivon, ekz-e: ``mi estas
sola/kiel la telefonaj budoj je l' aroro'' (Luis Alvarez); ``...
mia amo al li/neniam estis/politike neevoluinta'' (Tom Kennedy);
ktp.<P>
e Philippe elstare plaas al mi la kvaza-preo ``Sankta Gejo''
(kiun kelkaj eble taksos blasfemao), kaj la movadao ``Al mia
krokodilo'':<P>
<PRE>
Neniuj krokodilaj larmoj
verios de nun
sur mian verdstelitan bruston...</PRE>
<P>
Dua lakvante kontribuinto estas David Mager. Lia muzo estas
pli emocia; li anka bonege regas klasikajn versoformojn (ekz-e
soneton), kaj ofte sukcesas liveri tiun malfacilan simplecon,
kiu ne trafas en banalecon:<P>
<PRE>
Fine mi vin prenus inter miajn brakojn
ion i mi farus spite iujn drakojn.</PRE>
<P>
Mi jam aludis la altan kvaliton de la poemaro. Eble aparte menciindas
du poemoj de Gerrit Berveling, mem ne samseksemulo, sed simpatianto
de la gejaj sociaj problemoj. En ``La samseksemulo'' li priskribas
la teruran sorton de senkulpa gejo, mortbatita en publika necesejo:<P>
<PRE>
mortigis lin knaboj en insoj
ho amis li knabojn en insoj!</PRE>
<P>
Kaj ``Dilemo de Aidosulo'' forte sentigas tragedion de homo trafita
de tiu plagao.<P>
En la traduka parto aperas 24 poemoj el diversaj lingvoj kaj diversaj
epokoj. En i la nivelo de la verkoj estas pli varia (supozeble
depende de la sperto de la tradukintoj), sed enerale akceptinda.
Nur la latinajn poetojn kaj poemojn de Verlaine mi povis kompari
kun originaloj (ne havante la anglajn tekstojn). La tradukoj
el Catullus kaj Martialis tre fidelas al la originaloj (kaj multe
superas la anglajn tradukojn, kiujn mi posedas). Tiuj el Verlaine
estas adekvataj, sed eble ne sufie sonoraj --- ho kiom mi volus
vidi, kiel traktus i originalojn la karmemora kaj genia Waringhien!<P>
Sed ne necesas koni originalojn por jui tradukon el vidpunkto
Esperanta. Gravas al leganto la prezentita legao: u plezurigas?
Pri la plimulto i tie mi respondas jese. Plaas ``La junulo''
de van Hattum, trad. Schippers, el kiu:<P>
<PRE>
Subite la preeja kariljon'
Priveras lin per floroj, papilioj,
koloraj eroj de birdmelodioj,
kvaza per gaja sunfeston'.</PRE>
<P>
Mi firme rekomendas tiun i libron --- nur ne al homoj pudoraj!<P>

La Gramatika ABC-mempraktikilo estas alloge moderna lernilo kaj
instruilo, la unua ero de plurpeca serio. Krom la nun aperinta
ekzercaro la kompleto konsistos ankora el <A HREF="004197.html">
ABC-Gramatiko</A>, tri
apartaj kajeroj kun vortolistoj (esperanto-franca-angla;
esperanto-nederlanda-germana kaj esperanto-itala-hispana), kaj la
verkintoj antavidas aperigi kasedon kun la ekzercoj,
prilaboritaj por lingvolaboratoria uzo. Espereble la gramatika
libro balda aperos, ja i enhavos la teorian parton al kies
klarigoj iam aludas la referencoj de la mempraktikilo.<P>
La ekzercaro estas uzebla anka en si mem, kvankam por orientii
en i oni devas bone koni la gramatikajn terminojn. Eble ne iu
konscias pri tio, sed e bonaj esperantistoj povas havi
problemojn i-kampe. Por klarigi la signifon de la fakvortoj kaj
samtempe faciligi la uzon de la materialo la kompilintoj komence
de la libro donas orientigan kaj strukturan indekson, kies
tabelformo estas interesa resumo pri la labirinto de gramatiko.
La strukturigo de la enhavo estas laalfabeta, do iu elektu
temojn la siaj bezonoj kaj plao.<P>
La unuopaj gramatikaj problemoj praktikeblas plurnivele per
travideblaj, bone aranitaj ekzercoj. Modeloj enkondukas la
laboron, plurloke desegnaoj ilustras kaj vigligas la paojn. La
plej oftaj ekzercotipoj estas dialogoj kaj kompletigendaj
frazoj. Vidante ``om''-vorteton, oni devas elekti el inter la
donitaj prepozicioj. Bona ideo estis doni la tujajn solvojn
paralele kun la ekzercoj, tiel la praktikilo estas uzebla anka
por memlernantoj. Por variigi la praktikadon la ekzercado ofte
povas ripetii ekirante anka de la solvokolumnoj.<P>
La temoj de la taskoj estas multkoloraj, interesaj kaj vere
internaciaj. Proverboj, urnalaj artikolfragmentoj,
literaturaeroj, iom da movadhistorio, moderna arto, religio,
kulturhistorio, fabeloj, enigmoj kaas en si la digestendajn
konojn.<P>
La praktikilon mi opinias bone uzebla je mezgrada lingvonivelo ne
nur por memlernantoj, sed anka dum la kursa instruado. La ria
kolekto de ekzemploj ebligas amuzan kaj interesan trejnado sur la
kampo de la ``seka'' kaj ofte neatata gramatiko. Kelkaj partoj
estas precipe pensigaj kaj studindaj anka por spertaj
samideanoj. Jen bona okazo por kontroli niajn konojn pri la
lingvo (uzo de akuzativo, da-de problemo, transitiveco de
verboj, vortfarado); utilas ekkoni novan lingvouzon, frean
esperanton kaj cerbumi pri nekutimaj strukturoj kaj frazoj (kun
la celo kompreni kaj ne nepre imiti ilin!). Sekvante la
ekzercoseriojn la leganto certe perceptos la diferencon inter la
frazoj ``Li alportis siajn kelkajn librojn'' kaj ``Li alportis
kelkajn siajn librojn''. Ni ekscias, ke rozoj ne rajtas
bonodori, ja bonodoro ne ekzistas; kaj se vi atas fikapti
signifas ne hobion sed manieron kapti (ion) per fioj.<P>
Studante frazotipojn kiel ``Oni vidas Markon helpi'' kaj ``Oni
vidas helpi Markon'' vi malkovras kiom gravas la vortordo en nia
lingvo, sed espereble vi decidos neniam mallongigi tiomgrade vian
direndaon se vi deziras esti ne miskomprenita.<P>
La Gramatika ABC-mempraktikilo certe havos sukceson inter la
studemaj esperantistoj, i farios materialo, kiun valoras havi
kaj ofte trafoliumi. u necesas pli da propagando rilate la
enhavon?<P>

<H2><I>Adace honesta romano</I></H2>
Jen longe atendita libro. Pritamtamita jam de jaroj, anoncita en
<I>Fonto</I> kaj anticipita per poemoj. Tia atendado povus tro strei la
atendojn; verko riskas tiel finfine ne respondi al esperoj
vekitaj. u i do ne plenumas la promesojn? Ne tion mi volas
diri. Oni ja ne rajtas esperi, ke alia solvos oniajn problemojn
kaj produktos uste tion, kion oni mem ne povas elfari. Ni
recenzu sen antajuoj.<P>
i estas adace honesta romano, super kiu la poetino obstine kaj
discipline penadis kaj klopodadis; i kreadis sen limo per korpo
kaj animo. Kaj la rezulto? Bravurao, serioza libro por maturaj
kaj movadspertaj esperantistoj, teksto en vigla konversa stilo.
i rakontas epizodojn el sia vivokuro. Ha, la erotikema Eli! Tra
edzeco kaj amrilatoj ia kompreno pri amo evoluas, evoluadas; i
gajnas maturecon kaj saon, kiuj fine kulminas en la tolerema
amligo kun Ernesto. Kaj en pledo por ``pardono'' (anstata veno).
Estas ellaboritaj precipe la kvin- kaj ses-dekaj jaroj sed, per
kelkaj saltoj, i fine iras is la nadekaj kaj la Praga Skolo.
i-loke i levas barikadon kontra kritikoj kaj anticipe pravigas
sian plumstarpunkton. Ni distingas en la romano kvar temojn: (1)
la am-aventuroj fadene tirias tra la tuta libro; (2) ni vivas en
la movado kaj renkontas esperantistojn; (3) leter-eltiraoj kaj
artkritiko de Baghy kaj Pumpr estas kulturhistorie interesaj
(plus movadaj demandoj: u uzi neologismojn?); (4) aliaj: aludoj
al astrologio, hinda filozofio, jogo, meditado, Kama-sutro,
panoilo (kvinvirta harmonio) kaj naziismo (7 paoj da
milithistorio). Iuj aferoj estas vere lerte vortumitaj; aliaj
estas diritaj sed apena; kelkaj estas per aludoj subtilaj a
nebulumitaj a jen kaj jen anka eksplicite esprimitaj. Tial:
``Kiu timas veron, tion ne legu.''<P>
Koni la nomojn, la personojn rolantajn en la romano, aldonas
multe al la intereso de la libro. Aliflanke, la atobiografia
karaktero de la verko povas ie-tie premi sur la beletran aspekton
de la enro jam emanta al prozeco, fakteco, sobra kaj simpla
komunikado. La apitro 4 (El la leteroj de Baghy), kvankam sendube
interesa por literaturamantoj kaj isostaj movadanoj, rompetas la
romanfadenon. Mi prenis la poemaron ``Nur tri kolorojn'', per kiu
i debutis en 1960, kaj la eraroze presitan ``El subaj fontoj''
(1981) kaj relegis kelkajn el la poemoj (Hetajro dancas, Triopo,
Imagu - tigro). Mi mencias ilin nur pro tio, ke i rerakontas
plurajn proze en la romano. Aliaj estas represitaj en i. Iuj
``poemoj'' min tute ne ravas: Aparta signo, Abismo de ekkono. (i
mem plendas pri la fua eldono de ``Verso kaj larmo'', 1986).<P>
u riproi narcisismon al la atorino? Ne, tio estus tro. Sed la
fakto, ke plurloke en la libro i adresas sin al la ``kara
leganto'', impresas al mi strange: kvaza i dependus de ni;
kvaza romano ne povus esti memstara kaj ekzisti memstare.<P>
La promeson koncerne ian ``kontakton pri antikva Hindujo'',
promeson pri okultaj povoj (telepatio, klarvideco, klaradeco,
prekogno, agurado), i ne plenumas. io tio montrias ne multe
pli ol iluzioj kaj revoj.<P>
Multaj hominoj marteladas en kapojn la kojnan opinion, ke viroj
sentas kaj kondutas malkiel virinoj. i ne apartenas al tiu
grupo. Jes, i asertas (p. 55): ``Julio estas monato de viroj. La
aero estas plena de sekso. Ili ne scias al si kun sia instrumento
konsili. i tro enas ilin.'' Sed sur p. 71 i konfesas: ``Dume mi
estas bela uemulino. Io kiel Donjuano en jupo. En viro mi vidas
instrumenton por volupto. Kiu al mi plaas, tiun mi devas havi.''
Diron, kiun i tamen tuj poste jam mildigas. Finfine i koncedas
(p. 297): ``agrenas min, ke li al mi ne montris sian
instrumenton. Tiun, kiun li portas senese kun si. Domae!''. Do
klare, se ne iu virino estas putino, do anka ne iu viro estas
vampiro.<P>
i imitetas ... ne! Pi simple ne estas imitebla. Sed mi
konstatas kun plezuro, ke Pi ne vivis vane. Mi gustumas ...
tiujn pie prefiksitajn verbojn, oftetajn en la verko. uste
tiujn, kiujn Auld kondamnas - ekscios mi unu semajnon poste; u
li pravas? Kontrafundamentaj? Tamen belaj, plaaj, neniel
konfuzaj, ne pli ol: polico, pokalo, postulo, ktp.<P>
Estas interese esplori, kion Rossetti nomas ``demotika lingvo''. i
konsistas i.a. el tiuj koncizaj parolrutinoj, kiujn Urbanov&#225;
atingas per forlaso de verboj.<P>
Kaj la lingvao? Bona kaj flua. i diras ``divorcitaj'' la la
difino en PIV (kvankam, depende de la kunteksto, eble, anka
``divorcinta'' tagus). Sed i ne iam sekvas PIV-on: tifono
(tajfuno), sulkigi (sulki), skuigaj spertoj (skuaj), la
zodiak-signoj afoviro (afo), virgino (virgo) kaj pafisto
(sagitario). u bonboniero estas pli elvokplena ol bombonujo? i ne
faras el muo elefanton, sed ``el kulo kamelon''. Tio estas tre
bona. Sed ne akcepteblas: nekorektiebla (268) kaj neripetiebla
(273).<P>
La libro estas defendo de (universala) amo, kaj tiu aspekto
meritus e pli da emfazo. ``Amo kaj doloro unu estas.''<P>
Trovi esprimita en libro tion, kion oni mem travivis kaj pensis,
jen plezuro. ar inter la ideo, la imagao, kaj la konkreta
teksto, la esprimao ja estas peniga pao. Gloron al Eli, kiu ne
nur pensis, sed anka registris siajn pensojn; ne nur travivis,
sed anka priverkis. Kie erpi tian krean energion? Kia sindono,
kia diligento, kia pacienco!<P>
Ne preterlasu legi en<I> Fonto</I> 174 (sep. 1995) la recenzon fare de ia
samgeneraciulo William Auld.<BR>

<H2><I>Dua kvaropo,<BR>
sproniva <BR>
kiel la unua</I></H2>
e multaj ``hispana skolo'' eble elvokus nomojn kiel
R&#233;gulo a de Diego,
sed sur hispanlingva teritorio, kaj precipe en Iberio, jam novaj
kreantoj famiis, inter ili Antonio Val&#233;n kaj, plej elstare, Abel
Montagut (54/74) <A HREF="#pied"><SUP>1</SUP></A>, merita verkinto de la Poemo de Utnoa. <I>Pro
Esperanto</I>, nun eldonis en unu volumo poezion, plejparte pri-aman, de
kvar iberaj literatoroj: la portugalo Gon&#231;alo Neves (64/87), kaj tri
hispanoj: Liven Dek (50/70), Miguel Fern&#225;ndez (50/81) kaj Georgo
Kamao (66/80). Talentaj iuj kvar estas, tamen iom da orgojlo ne
estas fremda al la pli junaj. Ili ne monopoligu la talenton. Indulgon
pri tia junverva mem-entuziasmo ni disponas, kondie ke la verkintoj
ne atake dishake kritikemas, ar ni suspektus e ili envion pri
kunpoetoj. Mi revenu en la kadron de l' recenzo:<P>
<I>Neves</I> persiste kaj konsekvence iras sian poetan vojon. Lia prozodio
estas esence propra, sincera kaj integra. Tamen ne plaas la
formo de tiu poezio, ia eksterao, ia perforta nudeco, ia
senvestigiteco: la vortoj diskuas kvaza vestoj surplanke. Unuavide
mankas la korpo, oni seru in pene-lege. La ideoj estas interesaj
(solulo, ili), la lingveroj tre tagaj (seko, ajn, i), esprimoj kaj
vortkunmetoj trafe originalaj, sed valoraj pensoj kaj validaj rezonoj
riskas perdii pro leg-rezigno de la legunto, forpuata de ajna
nekohero: lozaj vortoj, vortamaso, vortaoso. Kvankam enhave kohera,
la ``teksto'' de tia eksplodinta poezio ne logas al lego, al atenta kaj
zorga tralego, kian i bezonas por delekti. Vortripetoj, kiaj ``imo
imo imo --- freo freo freo'' ne invitas al enprofundio. (Cetere,
kiel citi tian verson --- laaspekte uste --- en i tia, mallara kolumno?)
Oni do devigu sin legi. Sed kiuj faras tion?<P>
u pro sia rotkvia talento, la atoro okazigis i Tragedion en la
Universo (de l' poezio)? Tian eksperimentan vers-tenikon la nacilingvaj
poetoj, ekspresionismaj kaj futurismaj, jam preterlasis anta
jardekoj. Kial aboli interpunkcion kaj majusklojn? Kial tiaj artifikaj enpaigoj
kun eskal-versoj kies vortoj tupas supren? Nura emo al malparnasismo
ne sufias por krei majstropoezion. Al provo balbuti mi preferas
tekston el klaraj, ellaboritaj frazoj. Kiel
deklami tian subfridigitan poezion? Mi miras. Ho la ria varmo de la
tekstoj de Fern&#225;ndez! Nu, la mallonga rutino legeblas facile, ne
postulas interpunkcion, ar esence i formas nur unu frazon; <I>mi
naskis</I> (la preskoboldo forrabis la titolon) konsistas el kvarpaa
klopoda penado por atingi la finan pintuman konstaton: ``mi naskis
poemon''. Multo en la poezio de Neves esprimias svage, enigme: elumi
(?), for-memi (?). Iuj versoj en la unua poemo <I>(patrino)</I> kaj la tuta,
lasta poemo <I>(ebrio)</I> ne kaas inklinon al megalomanio: ``mi estas pli
granda / mi estas plej granda'' kaj ``neniu minace / neniu konkure /
neniu atinge''.<P>
<I>Kamao - </I>kiu kontrabandis en la antologion <I>Trezoro</I> serion da verketoj
siaj, kiujn post <I>Sur la linio</I> li jam konsideras junulaj pekoj - nun
elmontras sian vortuman virtuozecon sur kampo poezia. Same kiel en
prozo, anka i-terene liaj lingva kreopovo kaj koncepta originaleco
estas grandiozaj --- sed kia la mesao? Jam ne plu fantasto, bone.
Fantazio forta, sed ne nura. Anka realeco. Materiisme pesimisma
mondrigardo tamen, plendoj pri la devo morti kaj falsa membildo ---
neeviteblaj pro la identigo de vivanta esenco (konscio) kun la maskulo
(personeco).<P>
Apladindas liaj bravuraj lingvoonglaoj. Ha, li remalkovris komojn
kaj punktojn, sed ankora ne la majusklon.<I> Viajn </I>estas profunda kaj
bela poemo. Enhave<I> kiel</I> ne plenumas por ni la atendojn postladajn,
pro tio ke i finias en sensignifa, ua siblo. Sed per la poemoj
<I>miraklo</I> kaj<I> mi</I> Kamao definitive pruvas sian poetan talenton; la
unua,<I> letero en tercinoj,</I> isfunde pesimismas; la dua jam anoncas
esper-revenon kaj viv-reuon. Komencinte per ``mi nun enuas la mondon'',
li finas per kuraa --- anka lingve - ``mi fartas viglon (vivon, sangon)''.
Felie. u li ne tro atentis mortintaojn, kadavrojn kaj mumiojn?<P>
<I>Dek,</I> malpli ambicia poeto, verkis tamen tre rimarkindajn poemetojn.
Krome, li respektas la lernitajn regulojn kaj kutimojn de skribado.
Elstaras:<I> Vi; En la neproporciaj </I>(kies lastan verson ni retrovas en la
titolo de la libro);<I> Se mi naskiis arbo; Kiel ajnan; Sur la tombon.</B></U></I>
Simpla, sed trafa ampoezio! Interesas <I>Interne de mia esto</I>.
Psedoscience sonas la pesimisma <I>Frakasas</I>, ar eble nur ajnvera, sed<I>
Mi sentis min</I> spegulas eventualecon de la vivo, e se maloptimisman. <I>La
hajkoj... Nu, it!</I> Jen plaas tamen: ``Tiktake hantas / noktomeze la
horlo' / dum tempo lantas.'' Sed kiam Dek uzas rimojn, li facile lasas
sin delogi al nura rimado. Pli ambicia poemo, kiel <I>Al viro nomata
Suzana</B>, eble necesigas klarigan noton.<P>
<I>Fern&#225;ndez,</I> la plej matura, la plej poeta bardo, enovas anka
kelkajn akompanajn paojn da prozo, per kiu li interligas la
poemojn kiel prezentisto; prozo same poezia kiel la poemoj.
Jen kreanto kiu respektas la lingvajn tradiciojn. Li konas la
vorton<I> koruso</I>, sed ne foretis la pli
kurtan, fundamentan <I>oro</I>.
Sed u konscie kaj intence li uzas <I>kaoso</I> en proza teksto (p. 8)
kaj<I> aoso </I>en poezio (p. 129)?<P>
Fern&#225;ndez scias, ke erotiko kaj sakralo sin intertuas. Lia
lingvao estas bildria: ``kue, kvere, / el niaj nudoj plekti
uo-skuon''; ``la seksoj preos / semnombrajn litaniojn intermite''; ``tuj
ovumis per forges' via amo''; ``la bekoj / de la du blankaj turtoj
viabrustaj''; ``Kaj ni kuas / sur kalendula lito, kunvenkitaj / de ama
lukto, fol' a kalenturo.''; ``Poste ni revenu / al nia ama, is
ploremoj ua / duelo, kiu iam nin kunvenkas.'; (mia bu' rekonas)''
``la varmon / el la vapor' de l' vortoj''; ``La ploremoj / elveras sin
tra l' poroj de la hato.''; ``kaj breas mian bruston via iso''.
ion-eldire, tamen per vortoj vualantaj, Fern&#225;ndez
versojn veras:
Transvivas vin la rememoroj: / via karno traplugita, / la spasmaj
spiroj, / via valo, / via ombra valo, / via miela prato, / via vulkano
arda a mistero / a kolibrido trepidanta, / dum ni done-riceve /

Por infanoj
<P>
pri Sud-Amerikanoj
</H2>
Junaj legantoj de la recenzata rakonto povus danki la
tradukistinon kaj la eldonistojn per la vortoj de la knabeto
Umberto: ``Nur de vi mi lernis, kiom grava estas la arbaro''.
Tamen ne nur pri la harmonia unueco de la homo kaj naturo
instruas la libro. i montras, kiel amo al la granda
vivoplena medio kaj senprudenta riska kurao, je kiu kapablas
nur puraj infanaj animoj, povas venki en la nobla batalo
kontra ajne nevenkebla potenco.
<P>
Malgra la neordinareco de la historio, kredeblas, ke i
povus okazi en la reala vivo. Ni aldonu, ke la rakonto enhavas
multajn etnologiajn detalojn el la iutageco de sudamerikanoj,
uste kaj malkomplike priskribas la vivon de la kamparanoj,
jen malfacilan laboron, jen gajajn amuziojn de la indienaj
infanoj. Tio permesas kvalifiki la libron ne nur kiel
atentokaptan kaj kortuan porinfanan legaon, sed anka kiel
sentrudan fonton de novaj scioj pri la vivaj situacioj kaj
vivmaniero de alilandaj popoloj.
<P>
La lingvao de la traduko, farita de Nora Caragea kaj
kontrolita de Roger Imbert, estas klara kaj gramatike
senriproa --- kio ne estas mirinda e redaktado de Zlatko
Tilar. La proza teksto estas presita per grandaj literoj kaj
nekutime aranita kvaza versa --- kio, verajne, devas
faciligi por infanoj memlegadon. Ni rekomendus la libron ne
nur por esperantemaj geknaboj, sed anka por
Esperanto-instruantoj, kiam tiuj bezonas aldonan legaon pri
la temoj ``naturo'', ``etnoj'', ``kamparaj laboroj'', ``infanoj
irka la mondo'', ks.
<P>
Multaj ilustraoj de Inge Steineke, la malmola glacea kovrilo
kaj bonega blanka pa-papero kompletigas la plaan impreson
pri la libro.

<H2><I>Libroteko Tokio esee jubileas</I></H2>
En la konciza postparolo de<I> Japana Esearo n-ro 1</I> Sy&#244;zi Keiko
klarigas, ke la eldono de i-esearo havas la modestan taskon
nur celebri la dekjaran jubileon de Libroteko Tokio.<P>
La jubileo vere estas bona okazo kolekti eseojn de konataj japanaj
esperantistoj kaj riigi la originalan Esperanto-literaturon per
ankora unu neampleksa, tamen sufie interesa libro.<P>
Inter la atoroj de la eseoj elstaras la nomoj de It&#244; Kanzi,
pli konata kiel Ludovikito, de Doi ieko, longjara japana esperantistino,
kiu redaktis la bultenon<I> Esperanto en Azio</I> kaj verkis kelkajn
librojn, de Mine Yositaka, kiu ne nur redaktis la kulturan revuon
<I>Riveroj,</I> sed kompilis la verkaron de Vasilij Eroenko kaj verkis
je ``La vivo kaj verkoj de V. Eroenko'', la biografion de Miyamoto
Masao en <I>Verkoj de Miyamoto Masao</I> kaj eldonis kelkajn librojn
sub la nomo La Kritikanto. Inter la pli junaj estas Kitagawa
Hisasi, kiu redaktas<I> La Revuo Orienta</I> kaj Tutui Kazauyuki, kiu
kelkajn jarojn oficis en Japana Esperanto-Instituto.<P>
La eseoj traktas diversajn temojn, sed la mi la plej interesaj
estas la eseo de It&#244; Kanzi ``Metamorfozo de la mistera serpento'',
kiu detale pristudas la problemon, kiun povas kazi la preseraroj,
kiel okazis jam en la dua eldono de <I>Universala vortaro</I>, la eseo
de Mine Yositaka ``Eroenko kaj mi'', la eseo de Takeuti Yosikazu
``Itiki Seiya, mia unua gvidanto de Esperanto'', la eseo de Tutui
Kazuyuki ``La profesia lingvo de Cezaro Rossetti''.<P>
Tiuj i eseoj vekis mian atenton, ar la eftemo en ili estas
esperanta kaj ilia enhavo el diversaj vidpunktoj profundigis miajn
konojn pri la esperanta literaturo, historio kaj pri la lingvo mem.<P>
La aliaj eseoj havas pli eneralajn a personajn temojn. Ekzemple
tre trafa estas la eseo de Izumi Yukio ``Mia Ultra Heroo --- Ul'
Tre Kara'', tamen la atoro, kiu prezentas unu el la gravaj problemoj
de nia nuntempa kulturo, ne sukcesis bone motivi la fenomenon
Ultra Heroo kaj ian signifon por nia nuntempo.<P>
<I>Japana Esearo n-ro 1</I> sendube estas utila libro, kiu direktas nian
atenton al la esperanta kultura vivo en Japanio.<P>

<H2><I>Berveling, poeto sentabua</I></H2>
En la enkonduko al la dua eldono (e Fonto, 1988) de sia
poemciklo ,,Tri 'stas tro'', Gerrit Berveling skribas: "Poezio povas
esti ludo, foje. Alifoje i estas viv-necesa. Tio multe dependas
de la cirkonstancoj en kiuj oni verkas. Amba iam-tiam por mi
realis. Sed i-foje superregas la luda elemento." Jam aperis dua
poemlibro de Berveling, nome ,,Kanto pri Minotaro (kaj aliaj
poemoj)''. En la enkonduko, Marjorie Boulton prave kvalifikas la
atoron "interesa minora poeto". La vorton minora oni komprenu
tiel, ke temas ne pri nova Kalocsay, Auld, Newell a Nervi, sed
pri poeto malpli ambicia kaj atinga.<P>
<TABLE>
<TD>
<IMG SRC="gif/lib/kmin.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=210><TD>
Nu, sendepende de tio, u oni verkas minore a maore, pro ludemo
a pelate de la vivo, postulendas kvalita minimumo. En ,,Kanto pri
Minotaro'' parto el la poemoj ne atingas tian minimuman nivelon. Kial?
Probable pro hasto. Kiel skribis Fernando de Diego en recenzo pri
la romano ,,Du virinoj'' de Harry Mulisch (trad. Berveling) en la
revuo Fonto (n-ro 157, p. 34): "[...] Berveling povintus plene
sukcesi. Li havas por tio vastan arsenalon kulturan, verkistan
kaj tradukan talenton. Sed li tro fekundas. Rapide, haste krei
poemojn, seojn, tradukojn, mainojn pagias iam je la kosto de
la kvalito. Prave diris Buffon, ke la genio estas longa
pacienco."<P><TR></TABLE>
Tial, ke ju-asertojn oni devas argumenti, mi unue prezentos
kelkajn ekzemplojn de hasta psedopoezio, anta ol turni mian
atenton al la legindaj kaj pensindaj versoj de Berveling. Jam en
Nia kredo (p. 14) troveblas poemeco nenie, al kio certe
kontribuas vorto kiel malbonaspirad' a jena verso: "ar nul
tagas i mond': Di' do prov-kreas in plu...". Simile, la
klasik-ean Elegio por Johano (p. 16) mi opinias konfuza kaj
senmuzika: La vortoj devus kanti mem. Same lamas Geedzio (p.
21), tro proceza, nekongrue kun la elektita strofo, kiel montras
la sekva ekzemplo:
<PRE>
[...] Jam jardeko pasis: la ventro kreskis
kaj malkreskis, estas triida nun la
familia rondo; la edzo trovis
novan postenon [...]
</PRE>
Kaj tiel plu: Al Horaco (p. 22) ege proza kaj senmuzika, sen
almenaa lingvodenso; a Al Jiri Karen (p. 25), en kiu mi ne
sukcesis trovi ion interesan por aliuloj. Plie: En Odo pri la
Tria Mondmilito (p. 26) Berveling pritraktas temon atatan de niaj
nunaj poetoj (ekzemple Ungar kaj Carr): la militon pro
Kuvajto. Tamen - kie la poezio?
<PRE>
Panik' Iraka: multaj soldatoj el
trane' kapitulacas sen ajna paf'!
Ekrane dekstren iras tankoj;
dume maldekstren kaptitoj stumblas.
</PRE>
Berveling produktis anka kelkon da, en vortoj de Miguel
Fernandez, "neeviteblaj hajkoj", kvankam verdire La Luzidoj (p.
67) estas nek hajko nek poemo nek io ajn entute difinebla. Mi
bone memoras la konsternion de Gon&#231;alo Neves en la libroservo de
la valencia UK, kiam, esperinte legi (pro la titolo) revelaciajn
versojn pri la epopeo de Camoes, li trovis nur jenon:
<PRE>
traduko brila
folifal' dumlegada
malusta gluo
</PRE>
Apena supereblan malkulminon atingas Al Marilu M&#252;nger, pri
malsukcesinta projekto (p. 31), kun terura metrika skemo
(oscedige ripeta, tede martela) kaj absolute seninteresa enhavo
(nura privata letero). Ni vidu ekzemple la komencon:
<PRE>
Svisa poto fidindas, u?
Kial, ho Marilu', mankas delonge do
viaflanke leter', reag'
via por mia pet': skribe sciigi min
u refoje okazos en
nova jaro kunven' samkiel en pase'
pri Kristana Kultursemajn'?
</PRE>
Al la antao mi aldonu ankora ion pri aparta subenro en la
poemaro. Bedarinde mi devas diri, ke, malgra la intenco de la
atoro, nek Esperantistio (p. 54) nek Progresanto jam... (p. 55)
nek Esperantista netraleco (p. 56) nek Unua kongreso (p. 57)
estas sonetoj. Por esti sonetoj, la la PIVa difin

<H2><I>Klera edzino havas ion</I></H2>
Kun ojo ne malpli granda ol tiu de la antaparolanto, John
Wells, mi bonvenigis la volumon<I> Klera edzino</I> al mia leterkesto.
Apartan riigivon havas la tradukita esperanta literaturo pro ia
multfonteco. De mia suspekto, ke mi certe lernos ion gravan pri
la bharata kaj aparte la bengala kulturoj, spronis mia ekscito.<P>
Tiu romano rakontas pri iu Dibakor Bandopaddhaela el bonfarta
bengala familio, kiu trifoje malsukcesis je abiturienta ekzameno,
kaj rezignis pri plua edukio. Li decidas, ke tagos por li nur
tia edzino, kiu estas malpli klera ol li mem. Sed, dum vizito al
parencoj en alia regiono, li renkontas belan sinjorinon,
enamias, kaj decidas edzii al i. La parencoj scias pri lia
malemo edzii al klerulino, do oni kaas la fakton, ke la bela,
plurtalenta uthika Mukhopaddhae estas altklasa magistrino pri la
angla lingvo. La cirkonstancoj, en kiuj Dibakor ekscias, ke fakte
li edziis al klera edzino, kaj la sekvoj de tio konsistigas
amuzan rakonton. La atoro mastras la arton krei personecojn,
kiuj disvolvias dum la progreso de la rakontado.<P>
La mi,<I> Klera edzino</I> havas ion: la atoro verkis altiran
rakonton, kiun la tradukinto fidele prezentas per (malgra siaj
postparolaj rimarkoj) preska pirone bona lingvo. Kun la helpo de
la postparolo, mi lernis multe pri la bharata kulturo de la
koncerna tempo. Mi ne povas diri, tamen, ke mi entute konsentas
je iuj konkludoj, sed la klarigojn kaj rimarkojn pri la kulturo kaj
lingvo mi trovis utilaj. Nomu min kontenta leginto!<P>

<H2><I>Bona distrilo kaj memlernilo</I></H2>
Mi iam opiniis, ke la plej bona rimedo por lerni lingvon estas
legi krimromanojn. Kaj jen nia astralia samideano Ronald Gates
aperigas e Flandra Esperanto-Ligo jam duan i-specan verkon. i
tiu romaneto darigas la sinsekvon de krimrakontoj komencitan
per La septaga murdenigmo, kaj balda sekvos tria: <A HREF="004338.html">
Morto de sciencisto.</A><P>
La samaj efrolantoj refoje kunlaboras por solvi murdon okazintan
apud fikcia astralia provinca universitato. Kiel kutime en la
i-specaj romanoj, sur la unua pao okazas enigma murdo kaj certe
neniu ion vidis. La la leoj de l' enro, polico havas nenian
alkroaon kiel solvi la enigmon, nek povas identigi la viktimon
kaj suspektas iujn. La tumulto daras precize dum duono de l'
libreto. Poste abunde aperas valoraj atestantoj, materiaj pruvoj,
sagaca edzino de unu el la policanoj atentigas al li (kaj al la
tuta policanaro) pri la efa el ili kaj la enketado alproksimias
al sia fino.<P>
Tamen, denove la la leoj de l' enro, nur sur la lasta pao oni
subite ekscias, ke la efa kulpulo estas tute alia persono.
Normala krimromano. Tutcerte, la atoro ne estas Dostojevskij a
Conan Doyle - mankas psikologio, ne tiom profunde desegnitaj
estas la karakteroj de l' efrolantoj. Puristoj povas trovi e li
kelkajn erarojn - u lingvajn, u faktajn. Sed anka tio povus
esti pluso - ja spertaj instruistoj povas priparoli kaj klarigi
al siaj lernantoj regulojn de pli usta vortouzo, pri eraroj de
polico/atoro. Kompense tamen oni ekscias novajn fakajn
terminojn: enketado, ricelado, kacio, ks. La romaneto estas
verkita en simpla, facila lingvo, en vigla, dinamika maniero.
En Esperantujo aperis nova talenta krimromanisto, kies nova libro
pliriigos nian literaturon.<P>

<H2><I>La antairanto de Esperanto</I></H2>
La lingvon Volapuko inventis Johann Martin Schleyer en 1879. i
estis prezentita kiel ``mondlingvo'' <I>(Volap&#252;k</I> ,Mondlingvo') kun la
slogano<I> Menade bal, p&#252;ki bal</I> ``Al unu homaro, unu
lingvon''; aliaj konsideris in precipe kiel lingvon por
internacia komerco. Dum la tria volapuka kongreso en Parizo en
agusto 1889, dek ses jarojn anta Bulonjo-e-Maro, oni parolis
internacian lingvon en internacia kongreso. Rimarkinda okazao!<P>
Estas evidente, ke Volapuko influis Esperanton, eble plej klare,
kiam temas pri la karakterizaj vokaloj en la konjugacio de la
verboj. Alia kampo estas la elekto de fontolingvoj: Praesperanto
havis pli latinan karakteron ol la Esperanto de 1887, kaj, kiel
montris Bernard Golden, la elekto de ermandevenaj radikoj en
Esperanto plej kredeble estis influita de la pli ermandevena
vortprovizo de Volapuko. Inter alie pro tio - sed ne nur! -
estas interese por esperantistoj koni tiun antairanton de
Esperanto. La atoro faris valoran servon donante al ni la
eblon konatii kun i. Tamen en la libro estas prezentita ne la
origina versio de Volapuko de 1879 sed reformprojekto lanita de
Arie de Jong kvindek jarojn pli malfrue. El la vidpunkto de ebla
influo al Esperanto estas kompreneble pli grave koni la version
de 1879,<I> Volap&#252;k I</I> ol la reformitan<I> Volap&#252;k II</I> de 1929. La
slogano ne plu samas: en<I> Volap&#252;k II</I> i tekstas
<I>Menefe bal, p&#252;ki
bal</I> (la kovrilo misgvide montras la originan).<P>
Volapuko estas severe regula lingvo rilate al la konjugacio de
verboj, ktp. Tamen la vortfarado en<I> Volap&#252;k I</I> estas iom neregula:
Pluraj sufiksoj havas nedeterminitan signifon. En<I> Volap&#252;k II</I> la
afiksoj ricevis signifojn pli striktajn. En kelkaj nemultaj
kazoj la formoj de <I>Volap&#252;k I</I> estas donitaj en la libreto.<P>
Volapuko estas ege ria el forma vidpunkto, precipe kiam temas
pri stato, voo, modo kaj tempo de la verboj. Same la prefiksoj,
sufiksoj kaj prepozicioj estas multegaj.<P>
La libro estas organizita en dek na apitroj: La unua temas pri
fonetiko, la dua pri etimologio, la lasta pri vortfarado. La dek
ses interaj pritraktas lavice la vortklasojn de la lingvo.
Interesa legado, kvankam iom monotona!<P>
Mankas indekso, vortlistoj, bibliografio kaj tabelo de la enhavo.<P>

Libroj pri anatomio (konstruo de la korpo) kaj fiziologio
(funkcio de la korpo) estas maloftegaj en Esperanto. La eldono de
tia verko da estas apladinda. Sur 128 paoj la atoro traktas
ian temon, kia povus esti interesa anka por nefakulo: elo,
histo, organoj, kontrakoncipaj metodoj, defendopovo de la korpo
kaj medicinaj helpiloj. La 69 nigrablankaj ilustraoj estas
facile kompreneblaj kaj plivalorigas la libron.<P>
Kromartikoletoj donas kuriozajn a nekredeblajn informojn. u vi
sciis, ke la cerbo ampleksas 14 000 000 000 nervoelojn
konektantaj iutage centoble pli ofte ol iuj telefonoj de la
tuta mondo? Ke dum sia tuta vivo la homo spiras 500 000 000foje?<P>
La libro estas facile legebla, ar la atoro evitas plej ofte
fakesprimojn. La nebone konatajn vortojn klarigas la bildoj. Por
reeldono estus bonvena alfabeta indekso je la fino de la teksto.
Tial espereble la verko rapide vendios kaj balda aperos denove.<P>

<H2><I>Li estas danera, ar estas poeto</I></H2>
Tial la japana polico forpelis je Vasilij Eroenko el Japanio en
1921. Tiam la japanaj eminentuloj, verkistoj kaj politikistoj,
kiuj protestis kontra la forpelo de Eroenko, eble, ne komprenis
la argumenton de la polico, sed nun, post 75 jaroj, ni jam bone
komprenas in. Signifa estas la influo de poetoj kaj verkistoj,
kaj la japana polico timis uste tion. Pasis 44 jaroj post la
morto de Eroenko, sed la influo de liaj verkoj ias pli granda
kaj pli vasta. Ni konas lin kiel Esperanto-poeton kaj verkiston,
sed li verkis originale anka en la japana lingvo. En Japanio kaj
inio Eroenko estas ege atata, kaj pluraj liaj verkoj aperis en
japana kaj ina tradukoj.<P>
Sendube, unu el la plej persistaj esplorantoj de la vivo kaj
verkaro de Eroenko estas la konata japana esperantisto Mine
Yositaka. Anta nelonge Japana Esperanta Librokooperativo eldonis
novan valoran volumon de Eroenko ``La kruo da saeco'',
kompilitan de Mine Yositaka. Mi taksas la libron valora, ar i
enhavas kvar fabelojn, kiujn Eroenko verkis en la lastaj tagoj
de sia vivo. Pri ili la rusa esperantisto Anatolij Masenko
skribas, ke la fabelojn Eroenko speciale verkis por sia moskva
amikino Zinaida I. amina, kiu same estis blinda esperantisto.
Per la fabeloj Eroenko deziris iom distri in, kvaza vojaigi
in tra diversaj landoj. Masenko sukcesis akiri la fabelojn el la
arkivo de Zinaida amina.<P>
La unua fabelo ``La kruo da saeco'' fontas el la hinda folkloro
kaj i estis verkita inter la 8a kaj la 12a de februaro 1952. La
dua ``Tri emeloj'' estas afrika. in Eroenko verkis inter la 23a
de marto kaj la 9a de aprilo 1952. La tria ``Cielulino'' estas
korea kaj estis verkita inter la 9a kaj la 16a de aprilo 1952 kaj
pri la kvara ``Alian Timemulo'', kiu estas turkmena, oni ne scias
precize kiam i estis verkita.<P>
Eroenko forpasis la 23an de decembro 1952 kaj, verajne, tiuj
estas liaj lastaj verkoj. La kvar fabeloj atestas, ke la atoro
e la fino de sia vivo ne forlasis sian verkistan plumon. La
lingvo de la fabeloj estas flua kaj esprimria. Impresas la
originalaj komparoj kaj metaforoj. iuj kvar fabeloj enhavas la
saecon, la humuron kaj la spritecon de la popoloj, kiuj kreis
ilin. Tamen por mi la plej poezia kaj influa estas la korea
fabelo ``ielulino''. i similas al eta gemo, kiu meritas eniri en
iun Esperanto-lernolibron, prozajn antologiojn a en esperantan
volumon, en kiu estos kolektitaj la plej belaj fabeloj el la tuta
mondo.<P>
``La kruo da saeco'' enhavas tre ampleksan studon ``Vivo kaj
verkoj de Vasilij Eroenko'', verkitan de la kompilinto de la
libro Mine Yositaka. Li detale kaj precize priskribas la vivon de
Eroenko kaj tiamaniere kompetente prezentas unu el la plej
signifaj personoj, kiuj multe kontribuis ne nur
al la Esperanto-literaturo, sed same al la disvastigo de
Esperanto en Japanio kaj inio. iuj, kiuj deziras ankorafoje
renkontii kun la verkoj de Eroenko, nepre devas tralegi ``La
kruo da saeco'', kiu enhavas ne nur saecon, sed anka rian
fonton da informoj pri valora vivo, dediita al Esperanto.<BR>

<I>Noto de Boris Kolker: Estas konate, ke Vasilij Eroenko sendis
anta sia morto al Zinaida amina manuskripton de sia libro, kiun
oni konsideris perdiinta. Kredeble, Anatolij Masenko sukcesis
trovi uste tiun manuskripton - la lastan gemon, kreitan de
Vasilij Eroenko en la tenebro de Stalinaj persekutoj de la t.n.

<H2><I>Traduka&#188;o sub lupeo</I></H2>
La trilogio ``La Mastro de la Ringoj'', de kiu ``La Kunularo'' formas
la unuan parton, estas verko, kiu grandparte ludis rolon en mia legado.
Almena dudek fojojn mi jam legis in, ekde mia dek-unua jaro.
Tial, ekpreninte la Esperantan tradukon de la unua parto, mi
samtempe ekprenis la anglalingvan originalon, por zorge kaj iom
suspekteme kontroli, u la traduko de tiu atata verko fidindas.
Post kelkaj paoj tamen, iu penso pri kontrolado forvaporiis,
kaj denove mi estis kaptita de tiu mirinda rakonto. Jam tio
parolas pri la alta nivelo de la lingvao de Auld, kiu fluas
senene, ne trudante sin, sed portante la leganton tra
multnombraj pejzaoj kaj aventuroj.<P>
La verko disvolvias ene de tuta mondo kun propraj rasoj,
lingvoj, mitologioj kaj legendoj, kreitaj de Tolkien, lerta
filologo, tra multaj jaroj. Post lia morto komencis aperi, kaj
ankora aperadas granda nombro da volumoj de notoj, skizoj,
poeziaoj, kiuj formas la fonon de tiu mondo. La fonto de io
estis antadorma rakonto, kiun Tolkien elpensis por sia filo, kaj
kiu eldoniis sub la titolo ``La Hobito''. ``La Mastro de la Ringoj''
darigas la rakonton pri la magia ringo trovita de la hobito
Bilbo en tiu unua libro. ``La Hobito'', tamen, ne prezentas la
komencon de la afero; aliaj poste aperintaj libroj, kiel ekzemple
``La Silmariliono'', pritraktas la kreadon kaj pratempojn, kiuj
decidigis la eventojn rakontitajn en ``La Mastro de la Ringoj''.<P>
En sia enkonduko al la traduko, Aleksander Korenkov provas
resumi tiun prahistorion, timante, ke sen tio la leganto malpli
facile elturnios inter la paoj de ``La Kunularo''. Mi tamen
opinias, ke tiu timo ne pravias. ``La Hobito'' kaj ``La Mastro de
la Ringoj'' aperis jardekojn anta ol haveblis tiu historia fono, sed
tiu manko ne malhelpis la popularecon de la verko e miloj da
legantoj. Efektive, parto de ia armo, miaopinie, estias pro la
multaj aludoj al aferoj ne plene komprenataj de la leganto,
aparte en la poemoj, kantoj kaj epope-fragmentoj, kiuj abundas
tra la verko.  Kelkaj de tiuj poeziaoj estas verkitaj en la
elfa, unu el la lingvoj kreitaj de Tolkien, kaj tiel aperas sen
traduko. Aliaj, tamen, estis verkitaj en la angla, kaj ne eblas
imagi pli kompetentan homon ol William Auld por traduki ilin.
Auld sukcesas reteni la rimskemojn, metrojn kaj anka la
sonmuzikon de la originaloj. Liaj poemtradukoj kronas i tiun
imponan aldonon al la traduka fako de la Esperanta literaturo.
Oni devas tre gratuli kaj la tradukinton kaj la eldoniston pro
ilia preteco entrepreni tiom grandiozan taskon, kaj pro ilia
sukcesa plenumo de la unua parto.<P>
La temo de la verko estas fantazia. Efektive, per i Tolkien
fondis enron, kiu ajnas neniel perdi sian allogon e verkistoj
kaj legantoj. Flanke de homoj, rolas elfoj, gnomoj, hobitoj,
orkoj kaj multaj aliaj rasoj. Malbona potenco celas superregi
ion pere de La Ringo, kaj la misio de la kunularo estas
efektivigi la detruon de La Ringo. La eventoj rakontitaj povas
esti komprenataj de infano (mi legis in al miaj filinoj, kiam
ili estis ses- kaj sep-jaraj). Samtempe, tamen, la atoro
pritraktas la eternajn temojn de bono, malbono, perfido, lojaleco
kaj sinofero, kvankam li iam insistis, ke neniel oni taksu la
verkon alegoria. La protagonistoj donas la impreson esti realaj,
kaj ne estas malfacile identii kun la diversaj anoj de la
kunularo. La leganto, aparte dum la unua legado, timos, ojos,
esperos, malesperos, ridos kaj ploros kun ili.<P>
Post multaj aventuroj, la kunularo disrompias, kaj la
postvivantoj de la okazintaoj sekvas diversajn vojojn
pritraktotajn en la dua kaj tria volumoj. Fininte la unuan
volumon, la leganto senpacience volos ekscii pri la sorto de la
hobitoj kaj iliaj kunuloj. Ni esperu, ke la dua kaj tria volumoj
balda aperu Esperantlingve por kontentigi la scivolemon.<BR>

Al la negranda familio de nur-esperantaj perfektigaj
lernolibroj (Paoj al plena posedo, Faktoj kaj fantazioj,
Vojao en Esperanto-lando) aldoniis la nova, samnivele
altkvalita libro de Paul Gubbins <I>Kunvojau</I>.
<P>
ajnas, ke el tiuj kvar la lasta celas la lingve malplej
preparitan studanton; i emfazas la lingvaon parolan, sed ne
literaturan; i apena tagas por atodidaktoj, sed emfazas
rol-ludadon. Do, apartenante al la sama speco, tiuj kvar
lernolibroj estas tute diversaj kaj reciproke suplementantaj
unu la alian.
<P>
La libro konsistas el 25 lecionoj zorge preparitaj. La
dialogaj tekstoj aspektas naturaj kaj enhavas klare videblajn
studerojn, kiuj poste renkontias en la samlecionaj trafaj
ekzercoj. Enestas diversspecaj dokumentoj, kiujn la studanto
lernas uzi kaj verki: aliilo, reklamaj flugfolioj,
atobus-horaro, veter-prognozo, ktp. io estas subigita al
la efa celo instrui aktivan uzadon de la lingvo. La tuta
materialo estas interesa, sufie internacia, kaj entenas bonan
dozon da humuro.
<P>
La libro estas bonkvalite kompostita kaj eldonita. La
lingvao estas klara kaj rekomendinda. Mi miras nur pri uzado
de ``komputoro'' anstata la jam enradikiinta
``komputilo'' kaj pri la urbonomo ``Sudhaveno-sur-Maro'' anstata la
uzinda, pli tradicia kaj pli usta formo ``-e-Maro'' (vidu:
Bulonjo-e-Maro).
<P>
Kiel kuriozao dirinda koncerne la enhavatan vivresumon, mi
diru, ke en Usono oni ne indikas en vivresumoj siajn aon,
sekson, rason, religion kaj aliajn personajn informojn, kiuj
povus esti uzataj por diskriminacio e labordungio. Kontraste,
la similspecaj demandaroj en la eksa Sovet-Unio postulis
informojn pri la nacieco (la fifama 5a paragrafo!), partieco,
familia stato, socia deveno, scio de fremdaj lingvoj, vojaoj
al eksterlando k.s.
<P>
Bonan vojaon al la libro kaj bonan kunvojaon al iaj
studantoj!

<H2><I>Vorton post vorto</I></H2>
Nia estonteco estas e niaj infanoj, finfine ajnas kompreni
anka
esperantistoj. Fakto estas ke aperas pli kaj pli da libroj, kiuj sin
direktas al infanoj. Kapti la infanojn estas unu afero, instrui la lingvon
estas alia. Tial nepras tagaj lernolibroj. Tion anka komprenis
Elisabetta
Formaggio. Siajn dumjarajn instruajn spertojn i konkretigis en
instru-libro kiu dorlotos la okulojn kaj cerbon de la junaj lernantoj.<P>
La libro --- kiu komencias per la ne ege
originala salutvorto, Saluton! ---
vorton post vorto enkondukas la lernantojn en la lingvon. Kaj tio vere
estas la plej okulfrapa eco de la libro. Kvankam kompreneble estas kelkaj
frazaj strukturoj, la progreso estas preska nur la vortaj
tupoj. is p.
50 la nura frazostrukturo estas ``X estas Y''. Tamen intertempe la lernantoj
lernis iujn demandovortojn, la kolorojn, la nombrojn is trimil
sescent
nadek unu (3691) a pli, ktp. Do, tiun
lavortan progreson oni certe ne
konsideru minuso. Same oni notu, ke la libro ampleksas nur dek
instru-unuojn a lecionojn.<P>
Sed jen, en tiu lasta kaias la manka
aspekto de la libro. Kio estas
``instru-unuo''? u i
egalas unu instru-horon? A du instru-horojn? A unu
semajnon da instruado? Tio tute ne klaras. Kaj same ne klaras multaj
metodologiaj, pedagogiaj kaj didaktikaj aspektoj. Certe, sperta instruisto
salutos tiun i libron kiel valoran kaj praktikan ilon por sia instruado.
Novulo tamen ofte perdios, ar
mankas e la plej eta indiko kiel uzi la
libron.<P>
Pri la formo mi ne multon diros.
Interesa estas la fina linio de iu pao,
kiu instruas prononcadon, ofte neglektitan aspekton en Esperanto-instruado.
La desegnoj estas simplaj sed allogaj; la du koloroj nigra/roz-rua en la
teksto estas sisteme kaj funkcie uzitaj.
Bedarinde estas ke --- kvankam en
kelkaj paoj oni uzis plurajn kolorojn
(ekzemple p. 20-21), oni ne isfunde
elerpis tiun uzon: p. 10 estas vera ekzemplo de foretita eblo.
<P>
Spertaj instruistoj ekoju; novaj instruistoj ekesperu ke Elisabetta
Formaggio ne nur verkos duan parton --- kiun antaanoncas la cifero 1
sur tiu
i libro ---, sed anka gvidlibron por instruistoj.<P>

<H2><I>Hamburgero ne tre erotika</I></H2>
En <I>La ludanta lumo</B></U></I> aperas tri ``erotikaj rakontoj'' (el kiuj unu
estas dividita en tri apitrojn) de la flandra verkisto Leopold
Vermeiren. Ili estas darigo de <I>La nuda feino,</I> sed legeblas
sendepende de tiu.<P>
iu ero prezentias kiel elpensata de juna viro kaj rakontata al
lia amatino kiel antaludo de ilia propra amorado. La noveloj
estas simplaj, naivaj kaj grandparte sufie palaj rakontoj, kies
kerna punkto estas sekskunio de viro kaj virino. En la plej
longa, tri-apitra rakonto Vermeiren ne sukcesas veki a teni la
intereson, la tuto ajnas stulta, diletanta kaj sufie
senerotika. La moralo impresas etbure antajua, la roluloj
havas nenion komunan kun vivaj homoj.<P>
Anka la dua, sufie longa, rakonto,<I> La juna viro kaj la
blinda virino</I>, komencias simile, sed poste anas sian tonon
al malpli supraa, pli interesa kaj psikologia nuanco. En tiu
parto trovias anka la sola efektive erotika sceno de la libro,
kie la geparuloj reciproke palpesploras siajn vizatrajtojn. Tiu tre
sentema sceno vekas seksan imagpovon multe pli efike ol ``ili
faris la ludon unufoje, dufoje, trifoje'' a ``iaj glitvandoj
interne estis agrable velintaj kaj aspektis varmaj kaj humidaj''
kaj similaj ``erotikaoj''.<P>
Trie aperas mallonga rakonto, kiu tute evitas realisman formon
sed ludias en fabeleca etoso. Tio montrias multe pli bona
maniero prezenti erotikan fantazion ol la provo de realisma
priskribo en la unua rakonto.<P>
La la kovrila teksto, Vermeiren verkis ducenton da libroj, efe
por gejunuloj. Mi bedaras tion, ar parto de la dua novelo en
tiu i libro pruvas, ke kun iom pli da fantazio kaj koncentrio,
li povus krei ion legindan.<I> La ludanta lumo</I> grandparte
similas libroforman hamburgeron - ja facile maeblan, sed
senartan kaj sensukan. Iupae Vermeiren e forgesas, kion li mem
skribis sur la antaa pao (ekz. p. 25 ``Do i ankora konis
lian nomon'').<P>
La lingvao de la traduko estas pliparte simpla kaj flua, kvankam
la dialogo foje portas spurojn de skribtablo pli ol de viva
babilado.<P>

Recenzo de Ludi por Ridi

<H2><I>Legu, ludu, ridu!</I></H2>
iuj atas ludi. Infanoj - por ekposedi regulojn de la socia
vivo; plenauloj por pli bone adaptii al anoj de la vivo.
Apartan valoron havas ludoj por gvidantoj de Esperanto-rondetoj
kaj -kursoj, por amuzi sian anaron. Tamen, krom bonaj
gvidantoj-instruistoj, kutime ege mankas specialaj metodikaj
helpiloj, kiujn oni uzu en la agado. La libro de Ghislaine
Tilleux-Craenhals (Gilena) Ludi por Ridi (Kunagadaj Ludoj por
Grupoj) plenigas la mankon.<P>
Sur 81 paoj la atorino sukcesis
priskribi pli ol 150 diversajn ludojn (kvietajn, aktivajn kaj
duonaktivajn, por grandaj, malgrandaj kaj mezaj grupoj,
interkonigajn, prezentajn, kunagajn, finajn, ktp.). Fakte, por
priskribo de iu ludo oni meze apartigas duonpaon, kvankam ofte
por kelkaj sufias nur tri-kvar linioj, alifoje preska tuta
pao. Multe helpas 33 akompanaj tre informplenaj fotaoj. Tamen
la plej valora trajto de la libro estas la metodikaj
konsiloj kaj komentoj al la ludoj. La atorino - licenciulino
pri sociaj komunikoj kaj profesia instruistino (inkl. de
Esperanto) - anka malavare donas metodiko-konsilojn (sugestojn
pri sekureco, elekto de partneroj, dividmetodoj de la grupoj,
ktp.). io i multe helpos al gvidantoj
kaj instruistoj, precipe al junaj kaj senspertaj.
La efa celo de
la ludoj priskribitaj estas amuzi, distri, ridigi partoprenantojn
kaj samtempe instrui al ili (en distra formo) iun bonan sperton,
praktikon, kutimon. Pro tio la libro estos ege utila. Tre mirigas la
fundamenteco de la priskriboj kaj sciencaj aparato kaj bazo de la
verko. Temas ne nur pri du indeksoj (enerala alfabeta kaj
laspecifa), sed anka pri ampleksa bibliografio, kiu enhavas pli
ol 20 verkojn el Belgio, Francio, Germanio, Kanado kaj Usono.<P>
Sufie alta estas la lingvonivelo de la libro. Gajigan
kovrilon desegnis Fran&#231;ois Craenhals (fama belga desegnisto, la
patro de la atorino). Resume: tre utila libro, kiu estos tre
populara.<P>

Malfacilas esti recenzisto leginte tian libron! La la enkonduko
la fratoj Strugackij estis tre famaj en la tiama Sovetio. El
kelkaj iliaj verkoj e produktiis filmoj. En 1989 anka la
okcident-germana reisoro Fleischmann kreis filmon el ``Malfacilas
esti Dio''. La eventoj en tiu i novelo okazas sur fora planedo,
kies civilizo travivas mezepokecan periodon. Okazas ne tre multe
--- nur en la sesa apitro eksplodas revolucio. Entute la legado
estas enuiga. Multaj scienc-fikciaj esprimoj restas netradukeblaj
kaj multaj frazoj estas nefacile kompreneblaj: ``Reglilo de
poprdo'' estas riglilo de pordo. Kion signifas ``La arbojn
difektas, jen kion''; ``La stalono rezultis aao''; ''Kaj pej
rondaron''; ``Kuri la la urbo''? Mi elspezus mian monon por pli
altkvalita verko!<P>

<H2><I>Utilega konsultlibro</I></H2>
La Manlibro pri Politiko (MpP) havas la formon de enciklopedio
kun proksimume 1150 kapvortoj alfabete ordigitaj. Sub iu
kapvorto trovias difino, klarigoj kaj uzekzemploj, nur en
Esperanto. i estas deklingva pro tio, ke sub iu Esperanta
kapvorto estas anka la traduko de tiu kapvorto al 9 naciaj
lingvoj (angla, ina, franca, germana, hispana, japana,
nederlanda, portugala, rusa - "elektitaj precipe la politika
signifo" la la enkonduko, sed mi supozas, ke anka la
diponebleco de kunlaborantoj ludis rolon, ar mi suspektas, ke
alie la araba estus pli forta kandidato ol la nederlanda).<P>
La la antaparolo la libro havas tri celojn: listigi kaj
klarigi la plej gravajn, bazajn terminojn de politiko kaj kampoj
najbaraj a iel ligitaj al politiko; esti rudimenta baza por
politik-scienco; doni ekzemplojn de politika lingvao.<P>
Prave oni enmetis multajn aferojn, kiuj ne rekte apartenas al
politik-scienco, sed kiujn oni ja trovas en novaoj pri
politiko. Ne mankas ekzemple: "insidi", "embuski", "atenci",
"konspiri", "artifiki", "intrigi", "kabalo", "kalumnio", "klano",
"kamarilo", "kliko"! Prave oni ne forgesis anka la multajn
mallongigojn, kiujn oni renkontas en politikaj novaoj.<P>
Aliflanke mi rimarkis kelkajn surprizajn mankojn: "Eropa
Konsilio", "makartismo", "Nordio", "publico", "Skandinavio", kaj
la bazaj ekonomikaj terminoj "proponado" kaj "postulado".<P>
La klarigoj estas enerale bonaj. Mi atis ekzemple la
klarigojn pri kambioj kaj tratoj, bilancoj kaj etatoj, kaj la
terminologia fiksado de esprimoj kiel "aldonvalora imposto
(AVI)". Tamen kelkaj difinoj estas malklaraj. Ekzemple, la
artikolo pri "gerilo" lasis min en ioma konfuzo, u gerilo estas
speco de soldato, de armeo, a de milito, kaj la artikolo pri
"kazo" donas neniajn informojn krom tio, ke oni ne konfuzu in
kun "okazo", kies artikolo bedarinde mankas.<P>
La lingvao de la libro estas enerale bona kaj flua (kvankam
iomete elstaras la trouzado de eliziitaj artikoloj la la
hodiaa kutimo por prozo), kaj mi opinias, ke la libro bone
trafis sian trian celon, doni imitindajn ekzemplojn de politika
lingvao. (Tio ne surprizas, ar la kunlaborantoj de MpP estas
plejparte anka kunlaborantoj de <I>MONATO</I>.) Mi tamen proponas, ke
oni ne uzu la vorton "alfabetigado" en la enerala senco de
legopovigo, ar multaj popoloj estas legopovaj sen alfabeta
skribsistemo kaj ne deziras "alfabetigon"!<P>
ar la libro estas produkto de kunlaboro de granda skipo de
homoj (16 a 22), oni devas atendi kelkajn pretervidojn rilate
la unuecigon de la tuto. Ekzemplo de tio estas la sensistema
uzado de jen "Marx", jen "Marks", jen "Markso" (PIV), jen
"UNESKO", jen "Unesko" (preferinda). Tamen unu speco de iom ena
eraro estus evitebla per atomata kontrolo, kiun oni ajne ne
faris, ar mi trafis plurajn referencojn al neekzistantaj
artikoloj.<P>
Kvankam la libro estas bone fabrikita, kaj ne ajnas disfalema,
kio gravas por tia konsultilo, la kompostado estas iom primitiva
kaj faras hejmkomputilecan impreson. Bone estus strebi al pli
profesia aspekto de la paoj kaj prefere skribi la lingvojn
inan, japanan kaj rusan per iliaj kutimaj skribmanieroj, ne
latinigitaj, ar ruslingvao skribita latine estas proksimume
same konvena, kiel esperantao skribita cirile.<P>
Utilaj aldonoj estus indeksoj de la nacilingvaj tradukoj, pli da
referencoj al parencaj vortoj (ekzemple de "makleristo" al
"kurtao", de "testo" al "provo", ktp - tiaj referencoj tre
helpas verkantojn), indikilo pri PIVeco de vortoj a sencoj, kaj
aldono de iuj vortoj el la "registro" al la efa artikolaro,
por ke oni ne devu duloke kontroli. Tamen e sen tiuj
plibonigetoj mi ne hezitas rekomendi la libron. i estas utilega
konsultlibro, kaj nemalhavebla por iu, kiu skribas en Esperanto
pri politikaj temoj.<P>

Recenzo Morto de sciencisto

<H2><I>
Dinamika, vigla, facila, simpla...</I></H2>
Denove mi povas ripeti la frazon: ``En Esperantujo aperis nova
talenta krimromanisto, kies nova libro pliriigos nian
literaturon''. Felie li estas ne nur talenta, sed anka
fruktodona. Al vico de jam konataj krimromanoj de Ronald Gates ---
<I>La septaga murdenigmo </I>kaj <A HREF="004020.html">
<I>Kolera afero</I></A> --- aldoniis <I>Morto de
sciencisto</I>. Denove la samaj efrolantoj: Polica komisaro Roberto
Elis kaj lia amiko universitata gardisto Petro Tomson kunlaboras
por solvi enigmon pri murdo de vizitanta sciencisto sur teritorio
de fikcia astralia universitato. Videblas, ke la atoro malavare
uzas siajn spertojn kiel iama estro de unu el tiaj universitatoj:
Li bone scias kaj la priskribitan scenejon kaj la konduton de
ties rolantoj.<P>
Do, denove murdo, denove enigmoj.  Interesa detalo: Se en la unua
romano i okazis somere, en la dua en atuno, i-okaze estas
plena vintro. Eble pro tio, ke niaj herooj jam iom spertiis, nun
ili suspektas ne iujn, sed distingas nur ses suspektatojn kaj
konscience kaj celkonscie seras motivojn (anka --- alibiojn) de
l' murdisto. Pri tiuj i iliaj penoj temas la romaneto, kaj
legantoj scivole kaj gape sekvas, kiel disvolvias la intrigo.
Oni povas konstati, ke spertiis ne nur la efrolantoj, sed anka
la atoro mem. Ja ne nur pligrandiis la kvanto de rolantoj kaj
la ``situacioj'' (juna senhejmulo, malfidelaj geedzoj, perfido,
aluzo, profesia envio kaj sciencaj fradoj, e militaj sekretoj
kaj rivalecintrigoj), sed anka, kompare kun pli fruaj verkoj,
signife pliprofundiis la karakteroj de l' rolantoj,
plireliefiis kaj samtempe pliriiis iliaj trajtoj.<P>
Unuvorte, tre interesa kaj alloga krimromano, verkita en
dinamika, vigla maniero, en facila, simpla lingvo.<P>

<H2><I>Por lingvemaj komputilemuloj...</i></H2>
Esperanto-parolantoj ofte estas pli postulemaj komputil-uzantoj ol
aliaj. Ili ja deziras uzi minimume du lingvojn. Iuj deziros
tekstoprilaborilon, per kiu ili povas tajpi Esperanton kaj la
finnan, aliaj volos optike rekoni tekstojn en la rusa, franca kaj
Esperanto, kaj ankora aliaj deziros disig-ablonojn por perfekte
disigi e linifino vortojn en Esperanto, la ukraina kaj la
germana. Trovi tiajn programojn estis malfacile, is anta
nelonge. us aperis la tria eldono de la anglalingva <I>The
Multilingual PC Directory. </I>Tiu i verko donas en 256
grandformataj paoj tre bonan superrigardon pri iaj plurlingvaj
programoj por IBM-kongruaj komputiloj kaj pri la manieroj kiel
akiri ilin.<P>
En la unua parto estas priskribitaj nur programoj kaj dosieroj:
tekstoprilaboriloj, tekstoreviziiloj, tradukiloj, litertiparoj,
programoj por adapti litertipojn, rekoniloj, programoj por adapti
la klavaron, ktp. Kaj io tio por pli ol 150 lingvoj,
inter kiuj la afrikansa kaj la albana, la ina, korea kaj japana,
la rusa, ukraina kaj serba, la zulua, la eskima, la nepala, kaj
kompreneble Esperanto.<P>
Jen nur kelkaj el la pli ``ekzotaj'' programoj, kiuj estas
listigitaj: tradukprogramo araba ina ea dana esperanta finna
franca germana hebrea hungara indonezia itala japana jida nederlanda
norvega pola portugala rumana rusa serba svahila turka; programo
por lerni la inan kaligrafion; litertipoj por la hebrea,
malnovgreka, hieroglifa kaj japana (hiragana/katakana);
disigablonoj por 41 lingvoj, inkluzive la francan, kanadan
francan kaj valonan francan...<P>
Programoj, kiuj traktas Esperanton, ne mankas en la libro: la
tekstoprilaboriloj <I>3B2 </I>de <I>Advent Desktop Publishing </I>kaj <I>The
Universal Word </I>de <I>WYSIWYG Corporation; Davka Scholar, MultiWriter,
Protext </I>kaj <I>WordPerfect (apelilo </I>ankora mankas, sed certe aperos
en posta eldono)<I>; TrueType- </I>kaj <I>PostScript-</I>litertiparoj de
diversaj firmoj; la optika rekonilo <I>Recognita Plus... </I>Ne mankas
la nomoj kaj adresoj de iuj liverantoj kun telefon- kaj
faks-numeroj kaj la elektronikaj adresoj.<P>
Dua parto en la libro traktas elektronikan komunikadon: Kie oni
povas akiri fremdlingvajn programojn, litertiparojn, ktp. uzante
komunikprogramojn kiel <I>ftp, gopher, veronica </I>a simple
elektronikan poton; kie trovi prilingvajn novagrupojn, la
lingvajn servojn de<I> CompuServe,</I> ktp.<P>
Interesaj en la libro estas anka la superrigardoj de la diversaj
normoj Latin 1 is 4, la diversaj kodpaoj de IBM kaj tabelo kun
la alfabetoj de preska ducent lingvoj, de la aola en Ugando is la
visajana en la Filipinoj.<P>
Por lingvemaj komputilemuloj kaj por komputilemaj lingvemuloj tiu
i verko estas vere ria fonto de informoj.<P>

<H2><I>Nesto de fuuloj</I></H2>
La scenejo de neordinara krim-evento trovias en vilao, kie na
homoj partoprenis en drink-festo. Je la dua nokte pistol-knalo
vekis la dibointojn kaj domanojn por informi ilin, ke la membroj
de ilia societo estas je unu malpli. Responde je telefon-voko al
la polico, alvenis geparo da letenantoj, Kars Koller kaj Lina
Brent. Apena ili komencis sian esploradon, ili konstatis, ke
venenas la etoson en la vilao malafableco, envio, aluzo, spitado
kaj ankora pli da negativaj sintenoj inter gastigantoj, gastoj
kaj domanoj. Tiu situacio, certe, pravigas la titolon de la
romano:<I> Nesto de viperoj.</I><P>
Kun sia iama notlibreto en la mano, Koller zigzage tirtrenas la
legantojn tra litanio da tedaj pridemandoj is la pao 165, kiam
li sukcesas senmaskigi ne nur la murdinton, sed samtempe anka la
viktimon! La leganto, kiu atente sekvas la okazintaojn kun la
propra notlibro emane, ne povas ne havi dubojn pri la
kompetenteco de la du policanoj kaj anka de la kuracisto, kiu
faris la nekropsion.<P>
Efektive, ekde la tago de la murdo, la solvo en la formo de
senkapa kadavro trankvile kuis sur dissekca tablo en anatomia
instituto. Tamen pro la mallerte planita intrigo de la romano,
neniu rolanto povis fari tujan identigon de la mortinto. La
murdinto intence malhelpis tion, ar li ovis 0,45-kalibran pistol-tubon
en la buon de sia viktimo kaj tiel pafis, ke la kuglo
dispecigu la kapon.<P>
La esenca donitao, bezonata por akiri neambiguan scion pri la
identeco de la murdito, estas lia hato, kies koloro tre
diferencigas lin disde la aliaj ``viperoj'' en la vilao.
Bedarinde, neniu sufie lare malfermis la okulojn por eltrovi
la losilon, kiu ebligas tiri ustajn konkludojn tuj post pao
70.<P>
Unue, la gastigantino, rigardante la kadavron sternitan surtapie
anta i, elbuigis jenajn vortojn: ``Mi scipovas rekoni la
propran edzon!'' Kiel? u nur per la piamo kaj hejma mantelo,
kiujn surportis la senkapa viktimo? Kial i ne seris alian
atestaon, ekzemple fingroringon? Se i estus palpinta la
manojn, i devus rimarki la hatkoloron. Nu, la manojn de la
murdito ja rigardis Lina Brent, la virina polic-letenanto, kaj
i e atentigis sian kolegon Koller pri tran-spuroj kaj malbele
tranitaj ungoj, tamen i neglektis la gravecon de la hatkoloro.
Se trovias kadavro sen kapo, la polico kutime devas seri aliajn
manierojn identigi in, ne surbaze de vestaoj, sed per unikaj
fizikaj trajtoj, kiel fingrospuroj, sangospeco, korpaj difektoj,
operacioj, ks. Tion Koller ne faris. Lia detektiva laboro
disvolviis en ablona kaj mekanika maniero, kaj konsistis
plejparte en pridemandado individua kaj engrupa. Sporadaj
interrompoj estis kazataj de lia dare kreskanta sento de
volupto pro proksimeco al la korpo de Lina Brent. Tiu unugroa
erotiko kuras kvaza purpura fadeno tra la tuta romano.<P>
Se Koller estus atentinta malpli la femurojn, krurojn kaj surojn
de Lina, kaj estus irinta al la nekropsiejo por propraokule
ekzameni la kadavron de la murdito, estas certe, ke li povus fari
pli rapidan progreson en la solvo de la murdoenigmo.<P>
La lingvouzo de<I> Nesto de viperoj</I> meritas plurflankan riproadon.
Nemere havas la malbonan kutimon pensi hungare kaj skribi
esperante. Ne sciante ustajn esperantajn vortojn, li ne hezitas
facilanime altrudi hungarismojn: parkano (Hu. <I>p&#225;rk&#225;ny</I> =
fenestrobreto, kornico); noteso (Hu. <I>notesz</I> = notlibr(et)o);
pantalono ``farmera'' (Hu. <I>farmernadr&#225;g </I>= drelik-pantalono, inzo).
Bizarao estas ``delikvento''. La hungara etimo<I> delikvens</I> signifas
krimulon a deliktulon, sed Nemere donas al la esperanta
neologismo tute kontraan signifon: viktimo, murdito!!! Li same
misuzas ``faldo'' kaj ``sekciado'' anstata ``falto'' kaj ``sekcado''
respektive, kaj ne glosas la germandevenan neologismon ``meldo'' (=
anonco, informo, raporto). Pli da kritikendaoj rilatas al la misuzo
de transitivaj kaj netransitivaj verboj kaj la surpaperigo de
piinecaj frazkonstruoj, rezultantaj el la ellaso de subjektaj kaj
objektaj pronomoj pro la influo de la hungara sintakso.<P>
Estas evidente, ke apud la nesto de viperoj trovias en tiu i
romano anka nesto de fuuloj: inter ili estas la geparo da
policanoj, la kuracisto en la anatomia instituto kaj e la
murdinto mem!<BR>

<H2><I>Ne tiom erotika</I></H2>
Neniu scias, kio estas erotiko kaj per kio i diferencas,
ekzemple, de amo kaj de pornografio. Kiom da fakuloj, tiom
da difinoj. Tre plaas la difino, kiun donis la plej granda nuna
poeto Octavio Paz [Oktavi o Pas], nobelpremiito pri
literaturo: "Amo havas tri nivelojn: amoro, erotiko, kie
grandan rolon ludas imagkapablo, kaj propre - la amo. Erotiko
transformis seksecon en sekretan ceremonion. i gardas socion
kontra eksplodoj de senbrida seksumado... Por mi erotiko estas
ritaro, kunligita kun imagkapablo. En primitivaj socioj i
mankas, ar e ili mankas imagkapablo. Nuntempa merkata aliro al
erotiko, kiu manifestias en pornografio, malutilas al nia
imagkapablo..." <P>
En tiu i aspekto mi estis iom seniluziigita pri la libro. Juante
la la (sub)titolo, mi pensis, ke en i temas pri iu serioza
pritrakto de la problemo pri interrilatoj inter la du seksoj, sed
temas nur pri la unua konatio de junuloj kun la specifaoj de la
korpo de la alia sekso. La libro tute ne vekas la imagkapablon,
krom, eble, e us pubera junularo.<P>
Tamen tio tute ne signifas, ke la libro ne estas interesa kaj
alloga pro aliaj aspektoj. La atoro estas fama pro siaj
multnombraj streaj aventurrakontoj por junularo kaj pro tri
kolektoj da amrakontoj por plenkreskuloj, kiuj aperis en la
nederlanda, pro kio li ricevis e la epiteton "flandra
Boccaccio". <P>
Leopold Vermeiren konstruis sian novelaron kiel la mondkonata
fabelaro "Rakontoj de 1001 noktoj". La juna poeto Marko devas
rakonti iun rakonton al sia bela amatino Silvia kiel pagon por
postaj amplezuroj. En trankvila, flua stilo, la junulo inventas
romantikan rakonton por sia amatino. iufoje la rakontanto devas
teksi la rakonton irka tri vortoj, kiujn lia amatino diris,
certe ne forgesante ornami ilin per erotikaj detal(et)oj, aludoj,
ktp. Propagandistoj de Esperanto, menciante la libron "La Nuda
Feino", ankorafoje rajtos aserti pri la granda bunteco de la
Esperanto-literaturo, ties enroj kaj la lingvoj, el kiuj i estis
tradukita. <P>

La temaro de tiu i libro - sciencfikcio kaj fantasto - estas
evidenta tuj post eto de rigardo al ia kovrilo, kie viro kun
surdorsa flugaparato levias el inter kvar kolosaj saroaspektaj
bestoj en la senmakule bluan ielon, en kiu pendas blanka planedo nekutime
proksima por ni, teranoj.<P>
Malanta la plaa bunta firmkartona kovrilo trovias dek tri
rakontoj, kies agado evoluas a en foraj spacoj kaj tempoj a tie
i surtere, tamen en ekscite stranga medio a kun surprizaj
fantastaj konkludoj. La skalo de la temaro etendias de niamondaj
renkontioj kun la nerealeco is akcidentoj en foraj galaksioj,
de vojaoj per tempomaino is la malkovro de la sekreto pri la
homosimilaj figuroj sur Paska Insulo.<P>
Ne iu rakonto estas samnivela kaj samvalora enhave kaj stile,
sed enerale la intrigoj evoluas logike kaj stree, kion rajte
postulas pretendemaj legantoj de tiu i literatura enro. La
amplekso de la tekstoj varias inter miniatura dupaao kaj
noveleca trideko da paoj. Simile varia estas la vico de la
kontribuintoj: dek tri atoroj (kun kontribuaoj entute ne tro
fredataj, tamen teme iam ankora aktualaj kaj uindaj) kaj dek
tradukintoj al Esperanto, amba el pluraj lingvoregionoj. Tamen
la etoso de la libro ne nur enhave, sed anka lingve estas sufie
kohera, senkonsidere de tio, ke iu kolektero ja estas memstara.
La tekstoj fluas en normala Esperanto, foje elegante, foje iom
peze pro teknika enhavo (ekzemple, kiam la atoro fakece klarigas
la konsiston de la atmosfero de fora planedo).<P>
Al skrupulaj legantoj povas manki vortklarigoj, sed multo
klarias senprobleme el la kunteksto. Bonvene ne aperas tro da
kutime neuzataj vortoj. Iom enas multaj preseraroj, ja eviteblaj
dum perkomputila produktado. Jen jam la dek-unua libro el la tuta
serio, grandparte interesa ne nur por la specifaj atantoj de
sciencfikcio kaj fantasto.<BR>

<H2><I>Miloj da parolturnoj</I></H2>
La unua merito de ``Parolturnaro'' de Hans kaj Kerstin Wiersch
estas, ke i entute aperis kaj do ekzistas. La dua merito estas,
ke la atoroj vere formikdiligente (dum dek jaroj!) kolektis
20&#160;000 ``elementojn'', kiel ili nomas la frazojn, frazerojn,
sintagmojn, dirmanierojn, idiotismojn kaj proverbojn. La tria
merito estas, ke tiu i kolekto (kvankam nur en la germana
lingvo) povas esti modelo ne nur por aliaj etnaj lingvoj sed
anka por unulingva ``Plena Parolturnaro'', kiel proponas la
kompilintoj de la libro.<P>
Kompreneble (kaj jen malavantao de tiu i kolekto), ne iuj
proponitaj ekvivalentoj plae sidas en Esperanto, ja ofte oni
simple devis traduki germanajn parolturnojn, ne trovinte aliajn
formojn a nuancojn internacie kompreneblajn. Povas esti, ke
samsencaj a samtendencaj parolturnoj el aliaj etnaj lingvoj
donus pli konvinkan rezulton en la lingvo internacia. Ekzemple,
por la germana <I>das Licht der Welt erblicken</I> (lavorte ``ekvidi
la lumon de l' mondo'') ni trovas: naskii; veni en la mondon. Mi
tamen povas imagi, ke oni povus trovi same arman parolturnon,
kia estas la germana, sed eble uzante alian ideon kaj aliajn
vortojn. Tamen jen kaj jen anka inverse, evitante germanismon
oni ne trovis plej tagan solvon. Tiel por <I>Schlagzeile</I> tute
bona kaj internacie komprenebla estas ``fraplinio'', lavorta
traduko, a ``fraptitolo''; sed ni trovas e la kompilintoj: titoli
ion majuskle. Fraplinio tamen ne nepre uzas nur majusklojn.<P>
Alia problemo de germana-esperanta parolturnaro estas, ke en i
probable (mi hezitas aserti, ar kompreneble mi ne povis traseri
la kompletajn pli ol 400 paojn) mankas multaj propre
esperantlingvaj parolturnoj. Tiel ni ja trovas <I>Krokodilstr&#228;nen
vergie&#223;e></I> (lavorte ``elveri krokodillarmojn'') kun ekvivalento
``hipokrite plori'', sed ne trovas la Esperantan idiomaon
``krokodili''.<P>
Cetere, mi rimarkis ke ofte la plej sukoplenaj parolturnoj estas
Zamenhofaj - evidente li anka tiurilate estis pli genia ol
multaj liaj postaj adeptoj. Nu, pri tio ne kulpas la kompilintoj,
ar ili ja erpis multon el aliaj verkoj. Por Plena Parolturnaro
oni (kiu?) devus trafosi milojn da libroj kaj revuoj, ne nur
vortarojn, por trovi pliajn vere sukoplenajn vortumojn. Sed anka
la arano de l' nuna parolturnaro kazas kelkfoje stumblojn. Tiel mi
legis sub la kapvorto <I>abbrennen</I> la germanan parolturnon <I>ich bin
vollkommen abgebrannt</I> kun jena banala Esperanto-formo: mi estas
tute senmona. Sed mi ja memoris pri multe pli sukoplena
parolturno de Zamenhof - kaj jen, hazarde mi vidis, ke anka
trovias kapvorto <I>abgebrannt</I> kun uste la plaa Zamenhofa ``esti
sen groo en poo''.<P>
&#230;e iuj kapvortoj oni en posta eldono devus trovi pli konvenan
aranon; ekzemple, sub <I>Auge</I> (okulo) aperas teksto de ne malpli ol
6 kolumnoj - do estas relative malfacile trovi difinitan
parolturnon. Sed kiel ajn, jen verko kiu utilos al multaj
verkantoj kaj precipe tradukantoj, sed, kompreneble, anka al
ordinaraj progresintaj parolantoj de la lingvo internacia. Anka
la mirinde modera prezo povos allogi multajn aetantojn.<P>

<H2><I>Poeto de amo kaj revolucio</I></H2>
La recenzon mi deziras komenci per lado al la senlaca William
Auld kaj Flandra Esperanto-Ligo, kiuj revenigis al ni la
trezoron: plenan poemaron de unu el la plej elstaraj
Esperanto-poetoj. Egeno Mialski verkis siajn unuajn konatajn al
ni versaojn en la dua duono de la 1910-aj jaroj. Sur la griza
fono de tiama Esperanto-poezio ili aspektis kiel perloj; ja Mialski
estis vera poeto, do ne versfaristo kiel multaj liaj samtempuloj.
Sed dum dudek jaroj da verkado li multe evoluis al matureco kaj
diverseco. <P>
Mialski vivis en tumulta epoko, kiu brulstampis liajn
personecon kaj poezion. Por kompreni lin kaj lian balancadon
inter fajna poezio kaj kruda afiismo, ni devas imagi la epokon.
Tiun imagigon provis fari por ni en sia ampleksa kaj cetere bona
studo Krys Ungar. Estis malfacile por i verki pri tiel enigma
lando kiel Sovet-Unio, tiom pli en tiu fora kaj stranga epoko,
vivante en la nuntempa Britio. Tial fojfoje, ia salato el iom
naive prezentitaj informoj pri la historio de Sovet-Unio, miksitaj
kun nemulte konataj (kaj ofte neklaraj) informoj pri la vivo de
Mialski, aspektas nekonvinke. Se la tekston antalegus iu
kompetenta sovetiano (ve, la plej granda spertulo pri la rusa
skolo en Esperanto-literaturo Boris Tokarev jam forpasis), tion
oni povus eviti, por jam ne paroli pri harstarige aa lavorta
traduko el la rusa de iu teksteto, atribuata al Mialski (p. 13).
Tamen entute anka Krys Ungar estas ladinda, precipe pro la
literatura parto de la eseo kaj speciale pro la prezento de
fragmentoj el esplordemandaj protokoloj (eltrovitaj kaj liveritaj
de Nikolaj Stepanov) de la fifama NKVD (sekreta polico), kiuj
legate frostigas la koron.<P>
Komence Mialski indigne malakceptis la
falsajn akuzojn, sed post apliko de certaj ``juraj'' rimedoj li jam
``libervole'' konfesis tion, kion oni postulis de li. Oni povus,
eble, imagi la ``jurajn'' rimedojn, kiujn aplikis al siaj
``kunparolantoj'' la ``revoluciaj romantikuloj'' en NKVD, sed apena
oni povas imagi, kio okazis en la animo de la Esperanta poeto-revoluciulo,
kiam li estis mortpafota pro ``gvidado de
kontrarevolucia kaj trockiista agado inter esperantistoj''. u vi
povas imagi sur tiu fono, ke iuj esperantistoj en la nuntempa
Rusio ne nur ojas pri repotencio de komunistoj (kiuj ja ne
povas regi sen NKVD-ecaj metodoj), sed kelkaj e arde kontribuas
al reveno de ilia kontrahoma (kaj kontraesperanta!) reimo?!
Dio gardu, ke ilin ne trafu la sorto de Egeno Mialski kaj de
dekmilionoj da aliaj viktimoj de la Granda Teroro! <P>
Cetere, anta
nelonge iu juna entuziasma usonano (!) afiis per Interreto sian
antaojon pri baldaa venko de komunistoj kaj stalinismo en
Rusio, al kio iu rusiano prave replikis, ke tiukaze unu el la
unuaj agoj de la komunistoj estus malpermeso de retpoto kaj
entute de Interreto (ni aldonu: anka de Esperanto) en Rusio.<P>
<P>
Ni revenu al nia Poeto. Egeno Mialski mem konsciis pri sia
dueco:<P>

Tamen, kiam la Poeto komencas mistrakti sian Muzon, i eklitanias
senguste, knare, malame kaj, kiel atendeble, ofte false:<P>
Antaen ni, kurae! Al novaj idealoj!<BR>

--- Papo krias en indigno<BR>

Ofendiis lia digno<BR>

(Ni klarigu parenteze, ke la komunistoj en Sovet-Unio iam
persekutis la religion kaj la eklezion, kion Mialski videble
aprobis. Estas amuze vidi nun, ke la prezidento de Rusio same kiel
gvidantoj de iuj komunistaj, naciistaj kaj faistaj partioj en
la nuna Rusio konkurencas pri fideleco al la eklezio, malgra
sia verajna sendieco.)<P>
For lulkantojn de l' dorm' por proleta infan',<BR>

Nur pri batoj de l' torm', pri daner', uragan',<BR>

Klas' kontra klas' - pro ekzisto,<BR>
kontra palaco - kaban'.<BR>
Ne komprenas tion nur filistro,<BR>
kion bone jam scias infan'.<P>
Kaj la plej fifama:<P>
Min pardonu, kara Zamenhofo,<BR>
Pri koment' al ``Venis nova sento''.<BR>
Estis vi naiva filozofo<BR>
Kaj nevola kapital-agento.<P>
Esperanto estas ne la celo<BR>
Sed nur helpa batalil-faktoro<BR>
En tutmonda proletar-ribelo<BR>
Por finfine venko de l' Laboro.<P>
Kaj ni nova jungeneracio,<BR>
Sen trompanta lingv-idealismo<BR>
Brake maru tra revolucio<BR>
al fincelo nia - Komunismo.<P>
Vidante tiun strangan hibridon, Krys Ungar kun dubo skribas, ke
komence de 30aj jaroj ``Mialski, u el neceso, u el konvinko,
estis en tiu tempo verkanta ekskluzive politike''; kaj i demandas
sin: ``u vera transformio a provo pri savio?'' Por kompreni
tion ni atentigu pri Vladimir Majakovskij, kiu estis idealo por
Mialski. Kion li admiris en Majakovskij, kaj kion li, evidente,
emis imiti? Jen la vortoj de Mialski mem:<P>
... poeto-bruegul', diboe vortosona,<BR>
kantisto kaj amiko de l' prolet'.<P>
...<P>
De la estrado sonis lia voo<BR>
kaj akre tranis adon de l' filistr'.<BR>
Kaj lia juna brav' amegis bru-diboa,<BR>
pri novepok' li estis tamburist'.<P>
...<P>
Krudpoeziis li, ritmire vortojn skandis,<BR>
etante ilin en svarmanta konsonant',<BR>
sed lia fajra flam' la novan verson fandis,<BR>
en nova form' eksonis nova kant'.<P>
Haltu! Tio ja estas portreto de Mialski mem! Vladimir
Majakovskij oferis sian talenton al la revolucio. Nu,
pro tio Majakovskij devis multfoje kompromisi kun sia talento.
``u el neceso, u el konvinko'' faris tion Majakovskij? Estus
neserioze imagi, ke Stalin a iu alia partia estro rekte mendus
al Majakovskij iujn verkojn. Majakovskij klarigis sian
transformion per la inventita de li nocio ``sociala mendo'', kio
fakte estas kaj neceso, kaj konvinko. La samo validas por
Mialski.<P>
Nu, ili amba malbone finiis. Majakovskij mortpafis sin en 1930,
kiel prave notas William Auld, ``parte pro personaj kazoj, sed
verajne anka parte pro seniluziio pri la proleta revolucio''.
Se li estus isvivinta la fifaman 1937, lin, kredeble, trafus la sorto de
Mialski. Evidente, oni nomus lin usona spiono; ja li vojais en
Usonon kaj atis ian gigantomanion. Mialski, ne tiom
sagaca kiom Majakovskij, plu plenumadis la ``socialan mendon'',
kio degenerigis liajn talenton kaj poresperantan agadon, sed ne
savis lin de falsaj akuzoj kaj mortigo en la fifama 1937.
iuokaze li restas unu el niaj plej signifaj kaj kontradiraj
poetoj, leginda kaj, felie, nun legebla en plena amplekso. Kiam
lia poezia talento floris, jen kio por li estis Esperanto:<P>
Torenteco de l' pasi-deziro<BR>
sur la verda kampo de la amo,<BR>
radieco de l' revad-inspiro<BR>
kaj neniam forianta flamo.<P>

<H2><I>Gruntante en interna labirinto</I></H2>
Du diversspecaj komiksoj disprucas primovadajn temojn per iaspeca
krude aplikata irigaciilo. La kataluna atoro Arnau Torres i
Tutusaus proponas ``malavare disetatajn tre internajn ideojn'' en
liaj du subgrundaj bildstrialbumoj. D-ro Senesperanto (neniam
senespera) per piroteknika spektaklo de vorta kaj bilda
superrealismo okas kaj amuzas kiel lata furzo dum solena
prelego. ``Ju pli ae, des pli sae'' ruktas Arnau, kaj subite
eksplode elpafas mitojn kaj fantaziojn esperantistaj. Nenio estas
privata, neniu estas sankta, ju pli interne, des pli
eksterigende.<P>
Tra la tuto Arnau elmontras raran amon kaj konon je Esperanto,
lingve kaj movade. Tiom ke tio elvokas admiron.
``Veni-vidi-grimpi, survoje al la fina eko'', li gruntas dum
petolado tra la interna labirinto. u pornografio? Nu, eble, sed
nepre lernenda estas la fona mesao. Pruduloj kaj malastuloj,
legu, vi perdos nenion krom viaj antajuoj.<P>

Oni ne kulpigu
<P>
la spegulon</H2>
Estas strange, sed al la simpla demando ``Kio estas ni?'' ni,
esperantistoj, apena havas klaran respondon a almena
sufiajn informojn, ar sociologiaj esploroj en Esperantujo
estas malmultaj, rudimentaj kaj malofte pli-malpli profesiaj.
Kiel indikas la atoro en la antaparolo al tiu i libro,
multo mankas en Esperantujo, ekzemple: fredata historio de
la movado, historio de UEA, literatur-historio, sociologio de la
literaturo. Do esploremuloj havas vastan kampon por fruktodone
labori.
<P>
Unu el tiuj esploremuloj estas Nikola Rasic, diplomita
kaj profesia sociologo, profesia esperantisto, kiu havas eblon
studi la Esperanto-socion de interne. En sia valora libro li
kolektis rezultojn de iuj pli-malpli seriozaj isnunaj
sociologiaj esploroj kaj aldonis sian iaman sufie detalan kaj
vastgrundan studon de la Esperanto-socio. Bedarinde, pro
diversaj kazoj la rezultoj estas ne sufie fidindaj.
<P>
Tamen ni povas, eble, aserti, ke averae en Esperantujo
plimultas viroj, ne tute junaj, kun sufie maldekstraj
politikaj simpatioj, ofte senedz(in)aj, kun alta grado de
klero, precipe menslaboruloj, multhobiaj, sciantaj kaj uzantaj
fremdajn lingvojn, konsciaj pri lingvokomunikiaj problemoj,
kaj ne tre religiaj.
<P>
Estas interese observi la cititajn statistikaojn pri tiuj
punktoj kaj pri pure movadaj kaj lingvaj: nivelo de kono de
Esperanto, longeco de aktivado, rilato de familianoj al
Esperanto, membreco en Esperanto-organizaoj, movadaj
vojaoj, abono al revuoj, legado de Esperanto-literaturo,
verkado kaj korespondado en Esperanto, parola uzado de
Esperanto, opinioj pri lingvonormoj (supersignoj, ortografio de
propraj nomoj, neologismoj, eropeco de la vortaro), pri la
Esperanto-literaturo, ktp.
<P>
Estas utile fojfoje rigardi sin en la spegulo. Same nesenutile
estas fojfoje rigardi sin en la sociologia Esperanta spegulo.
Almena ar, la la krudaj (ruslingvaj) vortoj de Nikolao
Gogol, ``Neego na zerkalo penjatj, koli roa kriva'', kio en
tre moligita traduko signifas proksimume: ``Oni ne kulpigu la
spegulon, se la vizao ne tre belas''. Kaj, se oni rimarkas
siajn mankojn en la spegulo, oni povas pensi, kiel ilin
malpliigi.

u la perfekta lingvo
<P>
troveblas?
</H2>
La recenzata libro aperis origine en la itala, kion
balda sekvis tradukoj en la germana, angla, hispana,
kataluna, franca, nederlanda kaj Esperanto. Ne ofta okazo,
kiam verko internacie grava farias rapide alirebla por
esperantistoj.
<P>
Umberto Eco estas monda atoritatulo, unu el la fondintoj de
la semiotiko (scienco pri signaj sistemoj) kaj populara
roman-verkisto. Liaj opinioj estas vaste atentataj. Li
evoluis de skeptikeco pri Esperanto al ia senkondia
subteno.
<P>
La prezentata libro estas rezulto de lia lastatempa intensa
interesio pri la problemo de internacia komunikio. i
nete diferencas de la konataj al ni katalogoj de planlingvoj de
Marcel Monnerot-Dumaine, Ernesto Drezen, Aleksandro Dulienko.
Cetere, la du lastaj (en Esperanto kaj la rusa) e ne estas
menciitaj de Eco, evidente, ar nekonataj.
<P>
La kadro de la libro estas multe pli vasta ol la nura historio
de planlingvoj. i temas anka pri la Biblio, filozofio,
lingvistiko, logiko, mistiko kaj aliaj diversspecaj kampoj. La
libron kronas priskribo de Esperanto kun alta pritakso de la
lingvo, ia <I>optimumiga principo</I> (kiu, cetere,
pravigas uzadon de la akuzativo) kaj ideologia fono. La
atoro intence emfazas: ``Oni tiam e zorgis, por ke oni
prisilentu la fakton, ke Zamenhof estis judo, por malebligi
iuspecan suspekton - en historia periodo, kiam, ni memoru,
formiadis en pluraj medioj la teorio pri `juda komploto'''
(kaj kiu, post prosperado en la hitlera Germanio, nun prosperas
en la ``demokratia'' Rusio). Kiel diras la proverbo, saa
homo komprenas e per duonvorto. Tial strangas duboj en la
medio de iuj esperantistoj pri tiuj a aliaj ecoj de
Esperanto. Kial, anstata konstanta remaado de la samaj
dubaoj, ne sekvi la mondan atoritatulon Umberto Eco, kiu
subtene citas la frapan aserton de alia eminentulo, la franca
lingvisto Antoine Meillet: ``ia teoria diskutado estas
vana: Esperanto funkcias''.
<P>
La libro estas sufie facile legebla por laikoj. Kaj, se
aldoni, ke i enhavas saan kaj interesan antaparolon de
Humphrey Tonkin, ios klare, ke i estas nemalhavebla por
seriozaj legantoj.

<H2><I>Arkitekto de la platona respubliko</I></H2>
Bonege esperantigita fare de la tradukmajstro William Auld, la
romano Spartako konservas fidele la etoson kreitan de la skota
verkisto J.L. Mitchell [Mitel]. Pli bone konata sub la
psedonimo Lewis G. Gibbon, li restis en la konscio de nia
jarcento kiel la plej talenta skota prozverkisto. Devena el
familio de terkulturistoj, li bildigis en siaj popularaj verkoj
la medion de la skotaj etbienuloj anta la unua mondmilito.
Radiografado de la sociordo tia, kia i estas en iuj
mondanguloj. Brutala epopeo pri la konservado de la libereco
perforte ektirita de la gladiatoroj el la manoj de iliaj
majstroj.<P>
La romano okas la leganton, kiu jam tralegis la verkon
de Giovagnoli. Dum la tralegado de iu epizodo pri la bataloj
inter la du kontraantoj la romano akiras konturojn de la
naturalisma kanono. Scenoj de interbuado, perforto kaj
rapidpasaj gestoj, deziroj, sentoj de humaneco. Kiu mordas la
unua tiu supervivas, jen la principo. Sur tiu fundamento la heroo
civilizema Spartako revas konstrui la utopian respublikon de la
helena filozofo Platono. Konvinkite de sia konsilanto, la atenano
Kleono, enuko, kiu kunportas ie ajn sur la batalkampo la verkon
de Platono. Akompanante iam kaj ie la Komandanton, la enuko
spertos en la fino la saman sorton: la krucumadon.<P>
Aparta figuro
estas la judo Geramo, ido de popolo respektanta unu leon kaj
unu Dion, li rimarkias kiel la plej batalema kaj elturniema.
Akompanate de sia edzino Judita, preta akui, li kunportas en si
la sopiron al sia lando, kiel la judoj iam malliberigitaj en
Egipto kaj Babilonio. Li ne revas pri iu imperio de iuj homoj
liberaj, ar li malatas la nejudojn kaj ties kredojn, mitojn.
Spartako, la traco mortigas nur en stato de neceso, protektas la
virinojn kaj celas starigi konsekvencon en la socia ordo, en la
sentoj, en la moralo, spite al sia barbara origino.<P>
La atoro
atribuas al li la ideon, ke Dio enestas en la homo. La romano
fermias jene: Estis printempo en Italujo, cent jarojn anta la
krucumo de Kristo.<P>

<H2><I>Sagaca, sed agaca</I></H2>
Kion skribi pri libro, kiu estas vera ofendo al la aetinto kaj
leganto? Devus averti min jam komposteraro en la dorskovrila
teksto, kiun mi legis por ekscii resume ion pri la temo. Nu, tia
miskomposto povas okazi. Sed ne devas okazi, ke en libro ambicia
la enhavo oni trovas kompostajn kaj lingvajn erarojn,
stumblaojn kaj hispanismojn tiom abunde, kiom neniam antae mi
renkontis en serioza verko! Konstatinte tiun agacan fakton, mi
legis kun rua krajono enmane; la rezulto estas, ke probable nur
dekono de l' paoj restis sen ruaj makuloj, kaj ke sur iuj paoj
sidas deko da ili! Tio estas netolerebla.<P>
Evidente, neniu reviziis la tekstojn anta presigo. Krom
ordinaraj komposteraroj, stumbligaj ne malofte estas anka
propraj nomoj, a u vi konas sinjorojn Espartako, Bismarch,
Trostski, Hinderburg, Churcill, Jeltsin, Zuinglio, Vortaire kaj
Lernino, landojn Servio (tie loas ``servoj''), sono kaj
Bosnio-Herzegobino, urbojn Munich, Moksvo kaj Venezio? (Tio estas
nur eta specimeno.) Ne pri iuj eraroj povas kulpi la
kompostisto. Unu el la plej atataj vortoj de l' atoro estas
``stabli''; nur malofte oni renkontas la ustan ``establi''.
Akuzativ-eraroj anka estas relative multaj.<P>
Mi konfesas, ke pro tiu i agaca erarabundo mi ofte formetis la
libron kaj bezonis terure longan tempon por finlegi in. iun
fojon mi rekomencis legi kun agreno, sciante ke denove mi
renkontos multajn, multajn kriplaojn. Sed mi ja promesis recenzi
... Mi supozas, ke aliaj eklegintoj rapide perdos legemon kaj la
libro imos sur breto. Domae, ar la la enhavo i estas vere
valora kaj e majstra verko. Kaj plia lado: anka la stilo kaj
vortprovizo de l' atoro estas treege bonaj. Sen la eraroj oni
povus legi in flue kaj ue. Nur jen kaj jen enas, ke la atoro
ripetas samajn analizojn kaj konstatojn, kelkfoje e per preska
sama vortumo; kaj trovias evidentaj duoblaoj, kelkfoje nur du
alineojn poste.<P>
La verkisto sagace kaj klare priskribas kaj analizas la historian
evoluon de l' homo en naturo, de socioj, kulturoj, politikoj kaj
civilizacioj. La kerno de lia analizado estas estio, kazoj kaj
la efiko de militoj. Bone li klarigas ekfloron kaj pereon de l'
diversaj civilizacioj en la historio kaj situacion de la sociaj
klasoj en la koncernaj kulturoj kaj politikaj cirkonstancoj.<P>
Tiel oni bone perceptas kaj komprenas la nunan situacion de l'
homaro anta la terura minaco de atommilito, kio donas tute novan
percepton pri la neceso de paco, kies premiso kaj kondio estas la
universala civilizacio, aperanta ekde la librotitolo. Ke la
konkludo de l' atoro kondukas nin al internacia, e sennacieca
humanismo la la homaranismo de Zamenhof, ne povas mirigi. Oni
povus diskuti pri iuj analizoj kaj tezoj de la libro (ekzemple
malusta karakterizo de etnoj), sed neniun vere kontesti,
maksimume kompletigi per iuj facetoj.<P>
Estas eminenta kaj konvinka verko, kiun mi rekomendas al iu,
kondie ke i a li estas lingve sufie firma por sukcese
transsalti la hurdojn starigitajn de la kompostkoboldo. Al la
eldonejo mi forte rekomendas, doni al aetontoj kompense pro la
ofendo konsiderindan rabaton ...<P>

intence, ar, escepte de unu, la eroj ne vere plenumas la difinon
de poemo. Ili estas fragmentoj, al kiuj mankas plejparte iu sento
de emocio a pasio. Ili donas la impreson, ke la atoro foje
notis iujn pasantajn pensojn, sed neniam trovis emon prilabori
ilin. Tio bedarindas, ar kelkaj fragmentoj eventuale povus
maturii kaj kreski en poemojn.<P>
Per tiuj konstatoj mi ne volas diri, ke tre mallonga versao
neniam povas esti taksata sendependa poemo. La verkoj de Daphne
Lister, ekzemple, ja montras kio atingeblas per plej asketaj
rimedoj. Tamen en ia kazo iu vorto tre gravas, io superflua
estas zorge elsarkita, por ke restu nur la esenco. Estas uste
tiu disciplina tralaborado, tiu sero de ustaj vortoj kaj formoj,
kiu konsistigas la metion de la poeto, senkonsidere u la
rezultoj estas mult- a malmultversaj. Rossler montras ajnan
deziron esti konsiderata poeto; nun li devas trovi la disciplinon
por farii poeto. Por montri, ke li posedas la kapablon, mi citu
la solan poemon (la mia difino), kiu trovias en la verkaro:
<H4>Cirklo magia</H4>
Mia cirklo magia<BR>
ne plu efikas.<BR>
Firme, fiere<BR>
iam mi staris interne,<BR>
irme la sora rondao<BR>

Sed<BR>

<H2><I>Avinaj rakontoj</I></H2>
Tena (1902-1995) estas la avino de la atoro, sed ne temas vere
pri biografio, ar timec rakontas pli anekdote ol sisteme pri
la vivo de pluraj generacioj el sia familio, tiel donante ian
impreson pri cent jaroj da vivo en Mez-Eropo, pri receptoj kaj
geedzioj, militoj kaj lombardejoj.<P>
La stilo de la rakontado estas simpla, sen balasto, sed kun
dialogoj surpaperigitaj jarcenton post la parolo mem, la la
rakontoj de la avino, dum ne mankas anka aludoj al la nuna
situacio en tiu parto de Eropo.<P>
Oni, cetere, devas gratuli la eldoninton, Herbert Mayer, ke li
sukcesis aperigi i tiun libron tiom rapide: en Esperantujo,
bedarinde, ne estas kutimao, ke teksto atingas libroforme
siajn legantojn nur monatojn post la verkado.<P>
``Rompaoj nur, sed persone gravaj'', skribas la atoro pri sia
verko. Por la legantaro ne tiom gravaj, sed interesaj kiel familia
foto-albumo de amiko.<P>

<H2><I>Sincere kaj honeste pri si mem</I></H2>
iu homo devas lasi iun spuron pri sia vivo. iu homo emas
analizi kiel i vivis, kian vojon i trairis kaj kion sukcesis
atingi en la vivo. u i povis realigi siajn infanajn revojn a
u i plenumis la celojn de sia junao?<P>
La libro de la konata Esperanto-verkisto Gerrit Berveling ``La
unuaj 25 jaroj en mia memoro'' estas serioza pritakso de la plej
grava parto el la vivo de la atoro --- la juneco.<P>
Li detale priskribas siajn infanjarojn, la vivon de sia familio,
majstre karakterizas la gepatrojn, sed lia efa celo estas
esplori sian propran evoluon, montri la cirkonstancojn, kiuj
formis lian karakteron. La atoro bone sukcesas fari tion, ar li
posedas la talenton de subtila psikologo, kiu atente esploras
siajn pensojn kaj sentojn.<P>
De la libro ni ekscias, ke la sola granda revo de la juna
Berveling estis farii pastro. Malgra la kontraargumentoj de la
patro, la infano forlasis la hejmon kaj nur dek-tri-jara komencis
lerni en la seminario de Stoutenburg. Tie la juna Berveling
perfekte ellernis la latinan kaj iom post iom enpais en la rian
mondon de la literaturo.<P>
Impresas la fakto, ke Berveling estas ege sincera kaj
memkritikema. Li ne kais e siajn dubojn kaj mispaojn. Atente,
foje-foje senkompate, li priskribas sin mem kaj tio estas la
granda valoro de la libro.<P>
La legantoj, kiuj bone konas la esperantajn verkojn de Berveling,
nun pere de lia libro ``La unuaj 25 jaroj en mia memoro'', povas
pli profunde enrigardi la homon Berveling, kies efaj
karaktertrajtoj estas la sincereco, honesto kaj granda amo kaj
estimo al la homoj.<P>

Jen lakanta recenzo pri tiu i unua kompilo pri diversaj
esperantlingvaj kantoj, precipe rokaj, eldonita de Eurokka.<P>
Papago (omart kaj Nataa): bone klare kantita aza.
Mia tero (ak Yvart): muziko eksterordinara, kantado franceca, ne
eksterordinare bona.<P>
Ansero-Vanelo (Kajto): tre tipe Kajto kaj kiel sciate ege
profesie. Kanto kun du vooj kaj alterna melodio. Virina ansero
kaj vira vanelo kaj en la fino miksitaj. Vi tuj volas kunflugi
kun ili.<P>
Babelturo (Fl&#225;vio Fonseca): brazile konfuze, ne malbona.<P>
Flava blankul' (La Mevo): fruroke anglece, fakte mi havis en mia
memoro e pli malbonan impreson pri ili.<P>
Kie ne plu (Solo): fantoma muziko tute stranga same kiel la
teksto. Sintezila muziko ripete sed bone farita. Almena pli bona
kvalito ol surkasede.<P>
Banala travivao de juna knabo: Per Amplifiki ekis mia kono pri
rokmuziko, populara, danciga, kaj anka i tiu kanto ne estas
escepto. Populara kaj destinata por furorlistoj.<P>
Reoj de cindro: de la pli firmroka trupo Persone kiu felie
trovis propran vojon kaj vere faras bonajn kantojn.
e vi min forprenu (La Rozmariaj Beboj): rapidmelodia kanto (kiel
cetere iuj sekvantaj kantoj).<P>
Nun vi scias (Bruemaj Najbaroj): brua sed povas esti pli bone
kantita, muzike jes bone la la stilo.<P>
Nur vin mi amos (La Alburnoj): firmroko por la atantoj. Sendube
pli bone kantita ol la antaa kanto kaj pli taga por eni la
najbarojn.<P>
La bonaj vortoj (Piamandurjes): kaj, kompatindaj najbaroj, la
tuto ias e pli
firmroka! Nur por atantoj de tia muziko.<P>
Knabin' de Sarre (EV): jen roka kanto kombinita kun folkloraj
muzikiloj. Strange, por alkutimii, certe en la fino tio bone
askulteblas.<P>
Trans-Erok-Ekspres (Tutti Futti): melodio kiel trajno. Oni havas la
impreson, ke tiu i (kaj la antaaj) francaj trupoj esperas pli
bone konatigi ilian muzikon pere de Esperanto ol eblus per la
angla.<P>
Muskola belulino (La Mondanoj): por fini, mita trupo kun ege
ritma kanto. Furorlisten.<P>
Plej furoraj kantoj estas tiuj de omart kaj Nataa, Kajto,
Amplifiki, Persone kaj La Mondanoj.<P>
Konklude: kiel interkonatigilo de la diversenraj Esperanto-trupoj
tiu i kompilo certe tagas, des pli ar de la plimulto
ekzistas nur kasedoj. ia aspekto estas kiel ia
muziko: aetinda. Do multe paru monon por povi akiri in.<P>

<BODY>
<H2><I>Profite vojau kun Edwin</I></H2>
Vojaoj instigas anka ordinarajn homojn al pli intensa
perceptado de la okazaoj, des pli poetojn, homojn kun viglaj,
fajnaj sensoj. Edwin de Kock vojais en 1985 al Eropo, al
Mediteraneo, ja tiuj estas la regionoj de lia pradeveno kaj
samtempe de lia interna kultura bazo. Li, sudafrikano,
inspiriis e siaj radikoj. Lia deka poemaro en la Internacia
Lingvo dokumentas ne iun paon, sed la por li plej gravajn
staciojn. Malgra la titolo Vojaoj la libro entenas ne nur la
resuman kernon de lia norda itinero, sed anka tekstojn pri lia
lando Sudafriko, pri Len Newell, Esperanto-poeto, kies
manuskriptovolumon Edwin de Kock remalkovris dum tiu i vojao,
kaj legeblas anka aliaj temoj, ekzemple omao al la centjara
jubileo de Esperanto. enerale la tekstoj ne estas esperantismaj,
sed travidebligas la - per la interna ideo pregitan - personecon
de la atoro.<P>
Temas entute pri 23 poemoj, de 17-silaba hajko is dekpaa
poemego; plej ofte la verslinioj estas senrimaj kaj ne iam la
atoro sekvas la jam sankciitajn ritmajn ordojn. Liberaj estas
ofte la formoj, same kiel la fantazio, per kiu li vagas tra
tempoj kaj spacoj. Temposmozo: jen unu poemtitolo trafa anka por
multaj aliaj. Pro tio la tekstoj ne nepre estas facile
kompreneblaj. Ne iu leganto disponas pri la sama kultura fono,
ne same dense scias percepti diverstempajn, plurregionajn
eventojn. Sed tio tute ne estas damao: La literatur-amanto ja ne
legas por konfirmi proprajn limojn, sed por progresi kaj atingi
novajn nivelojn. Krome la atoro dankinde faciligas la aliron per
klarigoj kaj komentoj historiaj, personaj, verkadaj, ktp. El la
tekstoj montrias homo erudicia, humanisto, atoro, kiu verkas ne
nur por si mem, sed kiu havas mesaon, e kie li plej persone
enplektias, en poemo priskribanta lian viziton e la tombo de
lia frato en Italio, mortfalinta tie en la dua mondmilito.<P>
La enkonduka antaparolo de Jiri Karen rilatas ne nur al la
tekstoj de De Kock, sed anka, eneraligante, al la aliro,
percepto, interpretado, taksado, ktp. de la moderna poezio. in
kompletigas leginda ampleksa biografio kaj verkadteoria studo de
la atoro mem: "Iom pri mi kaj mia verkado".<P>
La lingvaon taksu la leganto mem. Unuflanke i konservas la
-ujo-formojn e landnomoj, same kiel la majusklojn e derivaoj
de majusklaj radikoj, kaj ofte esperantigas proprajn nomojn;
aliaflanke li ofte uzas ne-fundamentajn elpensojn kiel fro, pon,
cis, sob, sor, men, pre, far (e anstata la simpla pasiva "de").
Aldonita vortlisto - enhavanta anka eble necesajn neologismojn,
kiuj tute ne lezas la strukturon de la lingvo - provas pravigi
tiun i transiron de la zamenhofa konvencio.<P>
Legantoj, sciantaj pretervidi la jenajn elementojn, certe anka
propraprofite vojaos kune kun Edwin de Kock. Cetere la libro
aperis en profesia, belaspekta kaj bonkvalita eldono.<P>

Artefaritaj molekuloj helpas en la milito kontra la HIV-viruso<P>
Kiam la homa imundifekta viruso (HIV) infektas individuon kaj
multoblias tie, balda ekestas sennombraj variantoj de la
viruso. La imunsistemo rekonas virusojn surbaze de iliaj surfacaj
proteinoj. Tiu rekonado devas esti dekomence lernata e la ekesto
de iu nova protein-formo. Per vakcino oni povas efektivigi tian
lernadon anta ol la individuo infektias. M<FONT SIZE=-1>ONATO</FONT> (6/1996
p. 4) raportis
pri la esperoj de viena grupo fari vakcinon el relative nemaligna
HIV-varianto.<P>
Nun, vekias espero anka por la jam infektitaj. Kelkaj grandaj
farmaciaj entreprenoj anoncis, ke ili volas surmerkatigi
substancojn, kiuj malhelpas la agadon de HIV-proteazo. Proteazoj
estas enzimoj, kiuj malkombinas a sintezas proteinojn. La virusa
nuklea acido multoblias en la infektita elo kaj direktas in
sintezi proteazojn por tiel produkti la virusajn proteinojn. La
proteinoj kombinias por formi elon, en kiu la viruso povas
eliri el la elo por infekti plian. La aktiva centro de proteazo
estas kav-forma strukturo, kiu ajne ne varias. Dum la pasintaj
jaroj, kemiistoj perkomputile projektis molekulojn, kiuj precize
enmetias en la kavon por tiel malaktivigi la enzimon kaj sekve
malhelpi la sintezon de virusaj proteinoj. Plej progresinta
ajnas esti ureo-derivao de la usona firmao Merck. Aliaj firmaoj
kiel Abbott, Hoffman La Roche, Bayer kaj Hoechst anka raportas
similajn sukcesojn. Post traktado de HIV-infektitoj per tiu
substanco kune kun alia, kiu malhelpas la agadon de inversa
transskribazo (enzimo necesa por la multoblio de nukleaj
acidoj), la virusoj ne plu estis detekteblaj en la sangoj. Tamen,
oni ne tuj atendu nepran sukceson. La simileco inter la
HIV-proteazo kaj kelkaj homaj proteazoj signifas, ke oni povas
atendi nedeziratajn flankefikojn.<P>

<H2><I>TerraCottem: agrikulturi en dezerto</I></H2>
Dum la pasintaj jardekoj, pro anianta klimato kaj tro densa
loado, multaj iam verdaj regionoj iis dezertoj. Provoj por
reutiligi tiujn kaj aliajn aridajn grundojn is nun ofte estis
malsukcesaj. Belga profesoro ellaboris simplan kaj efikan metodon
por kreskigi plantojn e en malfavora medio.<P>
Multaj kredas, ke en dezertoj ne pluvas kaj ke pro tio ne eblas
agrikulturo. Fakte en la plejparto de la dezertoj jes pluvas, sed
la pluvakvo tuj vaporias a forfluas. Do necesas iel teni tiun
akvon sufie longan tempon, por ke la plantoj povu sorbi in. En
1983 profesoro Willem van Cotthem [Kotem] de la Universitato de
Gent, Belgio, komencis eksperimentojn por kreskigi plantojn per
minimuma kvanto da akvo. Instigo estis la drama situacio en la
afrika Sahel-regiono, kie fosado de putoj kaj konstruo de baraoj
ne donis kontentigajn rezultojn.<P>
Li faris miksaon de la plej nova generacio de akvosorbantaj
polimeroj, mineralaj kaj organikaj sterkoj, kaj kreskostimuliloj.
Polimeroj rapide sorbas akvon (is 200oblo de sia propra pezo)
kaj iom post iom maltenas in. Plantoj do havas sufie da
tempo por preni la akvon. Samtempe, la sterkoj kaj stimuliloj
favoras la kreskadon. La ideo ne estis unika, sed Van Cottem kaj
lia teamo sukcesis trovi idealan kombinon de dudeko da elementoj.<P>
La procedo intertempe estis jure protektita kaj ricevis la nomon
TerraCottem [Terakotem] (TC). La universitato fondis komercan
entreprenon samnoman por surmerkatigi la produkton. TC jam estas
uzata tutmonde. Plej utila kompreneble estas la uzo por reverdigi
dezertojn, sed ie kie plantoj devas travivi en malfacilaj
cirkonstancoj, TC estas uzebla: ekzemple en sportterenoj kaj sur
deklivoj.<P>
ar la sorbo kaj malsorbo de la akvo plurfoje ripeteblas, uzo de
200 gramoj da TC je kvadrata metro efikas dum deko da jaroj. TC
ne estas toksa kaj eblas kombini in kun iuj sterkoj. Tamen ne
eblas mirakloj: minimume 200 milimetroj da pluvo jare necesas.<P>

<H2><I>Kato de la tato</I></H2>
Fine de septembro 1995, nigra kaj blanka kato, arma sed ne
rasa, rolis digne en britaj urnaloj, radio kaj televido. Humfreo
(angle, Humphrey [Hamfri] - same kiel e d-ro Tonkin) estas la
kato, oficiala kontramusa gardisto, de n-ro 10, Downing-Strato
en Londono, la oficiala rezidejo de la brita efministro kaj
ejo por kabinetaj kunsidoj kaj similaj eventoj.
<H4>Sen vodonrajto</H4>
Humphrey rolas kiel tata oficisto, ne kiel registarano, do restos
en sia posteno e se la registaro anios. Li iam estis senhejma,
sed post adoptio en 10, Downing-Strato vivadis prestie kaj
prospere; li nun estas 7-jara. Li rajtas eesti kabinetajn kunsidojn,
kiam li emas, sed nur kiel observanto sen vodon-rajto.<P>
La kato estas amata, kaj kiam li malaperis en julio, multaj malojis;
ar katoj ofte iom ekskursas kaj revenas, oni kun espero atendadis,
is la 26-a de septembro, kiam oni finfine anoncis oficiale,
ke oni devas supozi lin morta. Raporto aperis en la prestia urnalo
<I>The Times</I> [Tajmz], ``La tempoj'' en la senco de ``la epoko'') kun bona portreto
de Humfreo.<P>
Sed tiun portreton vidis policanoj e la Armea Kuracista Kolegio
en Millbank, strato iom proksima al Downing-Strato, kaj tiuj homoj
(ja trejnitaj al detala observemo) rimarkis la similecon al kato,
kiu en julio vizitis la kolegion, ajne senhejma; la policanoj
adoptis lin, nutris kaj prizorgis lin tre bone, kaj donis al li
la honoran titolon de Policano Patrol-Kato.<P>
Dum preska tri monatoj tiu kato loadis kun ili, amata kaj
kontenta, montrante la kutiman talenton de katoj bone hejmigi
sin kaj subigi homojn al siaj preferoj ... Kiam iu alvokis ``Humfreo!''
la kato tuj alkuris, forte ronronante kaj ekscitite. La unu
urnala versio, estis kaporalo en la Armea Medicina Korpuso,
kiu unue rimarkis la similecon kaj montris la bildon al la policanoj.<P>
Iu telefonis al la Kabineta Oficejo, kaj samtage Humfreo estis
portita al sia vera hejmo kaj reprenis siajn oficialajn devojn.<P>
Meze de la suferoj en la mondo kaj la malbelaoj de politiko,
tiu amuza kaj iom kortua incidento donis temon por ridetoj,
kaj la britaj urnaloj, radio kaj televido arme raportis pri
la reveno de Humfreo. Aperis pri la temo pluraj karikaturoj,
ofte kun iom malronronema politika implico, almena unu poemo,
diversaj komentoj.
<H4>Diplomatia noto</H4>
Potenca firmo, kiu vendas nutraojn por katoj, invitis Humfreon
rekomendi iliajn varojn reklame, sed el Downing-Strato venis tuja
rifuzo; ne estus digne. Sed <I>The Times</I> presigis diplomatian noton
de Socks ([Soks] - ``trumpetoj''), la Unua Kato de Usono, kato
de la prezidanto: ``Mi scias, ke iuj hejmbestoj en Usono, unuece
kun mi, sendas plej bonajn dezirojn al Humfreo kaj la familio
Major je i tiu felia tago.'' La oficiala mesao de Humfreo
tekstis: ``Mi pasigis mirindan libertempon e la Armea Kuracista
Kolegio, sed estas agrable esti hejme denove, kaj mi kun plezuro
atendas la novan parlamentan sesion.''<P>
La historio inspiris min provi poezian enron, kiun mi neniam
antae provis en Esperanto: la erc-epopeon uzantan klasikajn
tradiciojn.<BR>

<H2><I>Kronologie, ne zoologie?</I></H2>
En januaro 1995 la brita poto eldonis armegan serion de
potmarkoj (19p, 25p, 30p, 35p, 41p) pri la temo katoj, plejparte
ne-rasaj, iuj belaj. Per amuza koincido, la 25penca potmarko
povus esti kolorportreto de du el miaj tri katoj, Agata (siama)
kaj Aphra (tigrostria) kaj la 30penca tre similis rufan katidon,
kiu, kiam mi gastis en Kanado, persiste teladis kaj kaadis
miajn etajn objektojn sub mebloj.<P>
En januaro 1996 aperis serio (19p, 25p, 41p, 60p) omae al la
granda skota poeto Robert Burns [Robt Bernz] ducent
jarojn post lia morto. Skotoj iujare festas lian
naskidatrevenon, la 25an de januaro, per festvesperoj, ofte kun
la skota sakfluto, la afinternaa plado <I>haggis</I>, viskio, kaj
poemoj. iu potmarko montras verson de fama poemo. La 19penca
citas la unuan verson de la belega odo al muso, brile tradukita
de Reto Rossetti: ``Velura, kara tremuleto!''.
<H3>Kun muso</H3>
Belegaj estis tiuj kataj potmarkoj. Bonege estas, havi nun
kulturan serion pri tre valora poeto.<P>
Sed, rilate al zoologiaj faktoj, mi sentas ian anomalion, ian
paradokson: u estas vere racie, ke eta timema muso sekvu ok
katojn? Pli kongruus kun la natura ordo, se unu kato sekvus
plurajn musojn, u ne?<BR>

<H2><I>Metrofobio</I></H2>
Kia malsano? Ne temas pri ia timo uzi subteran fervojon, a
malemo al poezio; sed pri la dara timo, kiun multaj britoj sentas
pri la metra sistemo.<P>
La instrukcio el Bruselo, britaj vendejoj nun devas indiki mezurojn
kaj prezojn la la metra sistemo, kaj tio vekas indignon.<P>
La butikoj kaj magazenoj, kiujn mi kutime vizitas, plejparte kompromisas:
lalee indikas la metrajn detalojn, aldonas la tiel nomitajn
``imperiajn'' mezurojn. Mi adis multajn ercojn rilatajn al
mia fako, angla literaturo: ajloko en<I> La Venecia Komercisto</I>
devos nun postuli siajn 453 gramojn da karno anstata unu funton,
kaj tiuj ne bone ritmos. (Kompreneble, oni konservos iujn arkaikajn
mezurojn en literaturaj tekstoj, se necese kun piednotoj, kiel
jam pri kelkaj.)
<H4>Febra problemo</H4>
Mi jam sen problemoj akceptis kilogramojn, gramojn, metrojn, kilometrojn,
kvankam mi konfesas, ke mi pri febro ankora pensas farenhejte
kaj ne celsiuse, pro malofta uzo. Sed mi tute ne komprenas, kial
tiom da britoj antipatias la metran sistemon.<P>
Kiam mi estis en la elementa lernejo, mi malamegis aritmetikon;
kvankam mi faris ne katastrofe malbone. Tiutempe ni devis multe
ekzerci nin per kalkuloj pri uncoj, funtoj (16 uncoj), ``stonoj''
(14 funtoj) ``centpezoj'' (angle, <I>hundredweight</I>, sed mallongigita,
pro la latina, al ``cwt'' ne ``hwt'' - kaj ne cent funtoj, sed 112!),
tunoj (2240 funtoj). Almena oni ne devigis min parkerigi kaj
uzi la apartan sistemon uzitan de juvelistoj! Kaj pri coloj,
futoj (12 coloj), jardoj (3 futoj), mejloj (1760 jardoj).<P>
Fluidaoj venis en ``iloj'' el kiuj 4 faris pindon; 2 pindoj
estis kvarto kaj 8 pindoj, galjono. Kaj tiutempe, kiam infanoj
devis kalkuli la prezon de 6 1/2 pindoj da lakto a 13 jardoj
da flanelo, ni devis uzi la tiaman maldecimalan monsistemon kun
siaj kvaronpencoj, duonpencoj, pencoj, ilingoj (12 pencoj) kaj
pundoj (20 ilingoj); kaj kelkaj profesiuloj kaj e butikoj
ankora parolis pri gineoj - pundo plus ilingo - kvankam tiu
monero delonge malaperis!
<H4>Klarigo surtabla</H4>
Kaj kiom ofte, pli aa, mi devis arani la britajn monerojn
sur tablo por iu alilandano, por klarigi ne nur pri la detaloj
jam menciitaj, sed pri la sespenco, tripenco, floreno (du ilingoj)
kaj duonkrono (30 pencoj - krono jam malaperis escepte por kelkaj
festokazaj specialaoj!).<P>
Al iuj tiuj malfacilaj kaj nelogikaj ciferoj, kiujn niaj infanaj
kapoj devis ne nur memori, sed rapide uzadi, mi povus aldoni plurajn
aliajn same devigajn sed malpli oftajn mezurojn; sed estus tede.
<H4>Esperanto de mezuroj</H4>
Kiam mi iris al gimnazio, kaj komencis studi fizikon kaj kemion,
mi okiis, ar mi devis lerni novan sistemon por sciencaj
mezuroj. u frea turmentado, post tiuj tedegaj kalkuloj dum
5 - 6 jaroj? Sed mi miris: io estis pri mili-, centi-, kilo-,
ni devis nur kalkuli per dekoj a movi decimalpunktojn! Nekredeble
facile kaj logike! (Se tiutempe mi jam estus estinta verdstelulineto,
mi certe estus kredinta, ke jen la Esperanto de mezuroj!)<P>
Mi ne memoras kiam, sendube dum niaj lecionoj pri la franca, mi
malkovris alian adoltan sekreton: en Francio - kaj en multaj aliaj
landoj - anka la monsistemo estas decimala. Mi eble estis 12-jara,
kiam mi vere klare konstatis, ke ni britoj aras nin mem per
superfluaj taskoj kaj tedaoj, kaj ke britaj infanoj, perdante
monatojn da lerneja vivo en la plej favora parkeriga sezono, super
tiuj britaj mezuroj, estas tiurilate tre malavantaaj kompare
kun infanoj en multaj aliaj landoj. E tiam mi demandis min,
kial ni ne povas adopti la metran sistemon.
<H4>Serioza demando</H4>
Tre malrapide ni adoptas in: unue pri mono, kiu nun probable
estas komprenata de iuj. Sed mi memoras onklinon mian, ne la
plej inteligentan en nia familio, kiu iam demandis min tute serioze:
``Marjorie, vi scias tiajn aferojn; kiam ni denove havos realan
monon?''<P>
La brita metrofobio estas tre milda ekzemplo de la homa neraciemo:
supozeble i fontas parte el ano-timo, ordinara homa eco,
parte el naciismo, unu el la malbonoj de nia unu homa specio,
sed pri mezuroj relative negrava simptomo. Sed mi pli kaj pli
sentas la paralelecon kun la antipatio kontra Esperanto.<P>

<H2><I>Pliaj problemoj por policanoj</I></H2>
Post la apero de peceto mia en <I>MONATO</I> (oktobro, p. 16 - la fotao
ne estis mia) mi kolektis kelkajn novajn ekzemplojn de tio, kion
ni britoj atendas de niaj ofte ladataj policanoj.<P>
Policanoj de mia regiono devis seri blovpufigitan kaukan
irafon, altan . 7,5 m, kiun iu telis el infanludejo de
drinkejo: oni multe uzis tiun arman beston por diversaj
filantropiaj organizaoj. &#230;u e policano, kiu entile kaj simple
demandas, ``&#230;u vi vidis kamionon portantan multajn televidilojn?''
a ``&#230;u vi konas la viron en i tiu fotao?'', same facile demandus
``&#230;u unu el vi, sinjorinoj, vidis 7,5-metran irafon en ia
veturilo?''

Estas ilia devo, kuri tien, kie iu krias ``Helpon!''. Iom
malaplombige, tamen, kiam oni vokis ilin al apartamento en la
marborda urbo Bournemouth ([proks. Bonmaf] - loko de la 34a UK),
kaj ili iom draste enpuis sin, ili trovis junulon, kiu duis
sin, kantante la konatan ``Helpon!'' de la famaj ``Bitloj''.<P>
Kion konsciencaj policanoj faru, vokitaj al akcidento, kiu blokis
gravan vojon? Temis pri kamiono ial renversita, kun ia aro de
glaciaoj, kies konata eco estas, ke ili rapide degelas. Inundo
de glitigaj eksglaciaoj tre pli komplikos la blokadon. Inenie,
kaj sendube populare, policanoj rapide disdonadis ujojn de
senpaga glaciao al iuj atendantaj veturantoj, kiuj deziris. (Mi
esperas, ke ili trovis anka plastajn kulerojn.) La firmo ne
perdis pli ol per surmakadama degelo, kaj multaj gajnis, u ne?<P>
Mi ne scias, kiel policanoj solvis alian vojblokon, kiam en
Jorkiro fieraj folkloraj dancistoj (marodancistoj) rifuzis lasi
pasi atomobilojn; tre verajne per iom da takto firma; eble same
kiam en suda Anglio oni telefonis, ar junuloj ludis futbalon tre
videble, tute nudaj ...
<H3>Bestoj tiaj kaj aliaj</H3>
Ofte la plej nerutinaj taskoj de niaj policanoj rilatas al
bestoj; britoj ofte tre amas siajn hejmajn bestojn (kaj vi, tie,
ne miau al mi!), a simpatiajn sovabestojn. En orienta Anglio
oni vokis policanojn, por ke ili helpu resendi hejmen konfuzitan
cervon, kiu rifuis en publika necesejo. Iu portis al la policejo
dek junajn gerbilojn, trovitajn forlasitajn. Oni trovis tagan
prizorgonton. Policanoj, kiuj eniris suspektitan domon, trovis
inter la elektronikaj rabaoj de telistoj unu grandan araneon -
tarantulon! - kaj tre ojigis la knabon, kiu perdis sian amatan
hejmaraneon, familian amikon! La tarantulo-savanto tamen
konfesis, ke li ne tre entuziasme proksimiis al la okkrura
ostao.<P>
Mi suspektas, ke anka oksforda policano ne fervore ojis, kiam
oni alvokis lin, ar en farmaciejo subite aperis serpento.
Transdonite al spertulo, la serpento estis identigita kiel
sendanera, probable ies perdita hejmbesto. Sed la brava policano
ne sciis tion, kaj serpentoj ne montras identigilojn ...
<H3>aluzaj virafoj</H3>
Mi legis e du raportojn el du urboj pri virafoj, kiuj vidis sin
mem en fenestroj spegule, kaj, kredante, ke temas pri rivalo en
amoro, furioze sturmis la fenestrojn kaj ege damais la internon.
La pli grava virafa atako okazis al - policejo (!), kie la peza
kaj kolerega besto difektis meblojn, radioaparatojn, vitron kaj
tapion (kiel, la lastan, mi ne detalos).<P>
Malfacile kaj iom danere, policano ludis rolon de vakero kun
nuro, dum aliaj improvizis enfermejon el baroj celitaj por
atovojo.<P>
En Londono policanoj devis aresti hundon, kiu mortigis katon;
sufie komplikaj juraj problemoj rezultis. Anka en Londono,
domvendisto, asertante, ke virino ne sufie pagis lin, telis
ian tre amatan raskaton kiel ostaon kaj minacis, ke li mortigos
la katon, se li ne ricevos 10&#160;000 pundojn. Mi ne scias, kiel la
afero finiis, u la antaisto iris en malliberejon, sed almena
la policanoj savis la katon, kiu ne estis difektita.
<H3>Dormema hundo ...</H3>
</B></U></I>Kelkfoje oni sentas tenton ridi pri ia polica fuo: ekzemple kiam
polica hundo endormiis, uste dum oni priseris arestitojn kaj
bezonis ne ronkadon sed snufadon. Fripono telis televidilon el
la policejo mem, kiam iuj stabanoj seris krimulojn aliloke.<P>
Kaj en Oksfordo okazis filminda komedieto: en unu el la belegaj
kolegiaj ardenoj, sub brila lunlumo malfrunokte, vidiis
telisto, verajne celante fenestron. Sed jam losita estis la
pordego. Neniu deoris; kiel eniri? Ladinde kurae kaj lerte, la
patrolanto grimpis trans alta kaj forta barilo kiel eble plej
senbrue, kaj kuris al la telonto. Estis statuo.<P>
Malgra la misfortunoj kaj bizaraj bezonoj, foje niaj policanoj
ricevas iom da helpo tute ne atendita. Ekzemple, kiam telisto
enrompis preejon en la nord-angla urbo Saint Helens [Sejnt
Helenz], telis komputilon, poste trovis botelojn da komunia
vino, kaj tiel diboe drinkis, ke li profunde endormiis; mano de
arestonto vekis lin.<P>
Grupo de rabistoj en Londono eminente eraris: telis juvelojn kaj
monon, kiuj valoris 80&#160;000 pundojn, kaj, sciante, ke ili estas
asataj, rimarkis muron en kvieta loko, etis la rabao-sakon
trans tiun muron, forlasis la viditan atomobilon kaj intencis
reaperi kiel normalaj civitanoj, kiuj promenas. Iris al la alia
flanko de la muro por repreni sian sakon, nesciante, ke estis
muro de la loka policejo ...<P>
<H3>... kaj perfida hundo</H3>
Kaj e nia amo al niaj bestoj povas havi sian malbonan flankon.
telisto lasis sian hundon ekster domo en urbeto nord-angla, dum
li eniris tra la fenestro, kiun li frakasis. Sed la posedantoj de
la domo revenis frue; la telisto rapide eskapis tra malantaa
pordo, kaj la fidela kamarado pacience atendis lian eliron tra la
gardata fenestro. Policanoj ne facile persvadis la hundon
akompani ilin, kaj traktis in afable en la policejo. Ellasis in
matene, kaj i tuj kondukis ilin al la hejmo de la amata mastro,
anta kiu i bojis oje kaj svingis la voston. La telisto neis
ajnan konon de la entuziasma kamarado - sed estis arestita.<P>
Alia londona telisto pruviis kulpa, kiam inter objektoj
suspekteblaj en lia domo oni trovis amazonan papagon, kiu aperis
kiel atestao en la kortumo; sed la papago subite iis vera
atestanto, kiam ia vera posedanto venis en la kortumon, i oje
fajfegis kaj rapidis al la amiko.<P>
La profesio de policano postulas rapidan penson kaj pretan
menson; ne estas facila. Sed monotona i ja ne estas.<P>

Propono por elimini la lingvokaoson en Eropa Unio</H2>

En artikolo titolita 'Lingvaj proceduroj en Eropa Unio'
(<I>Esperanto</I>, junio 1995, p.  102-103), lingvofakulo
Detlev Blanke priskribas la senesperan babelan kaoson en Eropa
Unio.  En 1995 la organizao havis 15 membro-tatojn devigantajn
uzadojn de 11 <b>jure</b> samrajtaj lingvoj de la Unio:  la
angla, dana, finna, franca, germana, greka, hispana, itala,
nederlanda, portugala kaj sveda.  ar is nun la reprezentantoj de
la 15 tatoj ne montris inklinon adopti la jam pretan internacian
lingvon Esperanto, mi dediis profundan pensadon pri alia ebla
solvo, kaj elcerbigis projekton por enkonduki Esperanton, por tiel
diri, en kamuflita formo, kiu neniel povos ricevi kritikojn, e de
la plej mallarmensaj naciistoj kaj lingvoovinistoj en la Unio.
<P>
Temas pri nova planlingvo enhavanta egalproporcie elementojn de
iuj jure samrajtaj lingvoj menciitaj i-supre.  Sur la gramatikan
baz-strukturon de Esperanto mi metas vortprovizon konsistantan el
morfemoj erpitaj el la lingvoj uzataj en Eropa Unio.  La sistemo
estas ne nur neriproeble demokrata, sed anka matematike
pravigebla, ar iu lingvo kontribuas 1/11-ono de la elementoj en
la propra leksiko.  La etnolingvaj etimoj estas alprenitaj en la
plej konvena formo kaj ricevas Esperantajn gramatikajn finaojn
kaj afiksojn por ebligi fluan esprimadon en Erosperanto kaj doni
impreson de vere vivanta lingvo.
<P>
La unua provo demonstri, kiel praktike funkcias tiu lingvoamalgamo
estas traduko de la Esperanta himno La Espero.  Jen provizora
versio de la unua strofo.

<H4>Het Hopo</H4>

Dans het verdenon komis neosa gefuhlo,
<BR>
Traves het verdeno andas vahva ropo;
<BR>
Mit voariloj av kevea anemo
<BR>
Agora from luogo voaru den vers luogo.
<P>
Por disvastigi neformalan uzon de Erosperanto, anta ol i estos
oficiale akceptita, kelkaj entuziasmuloj jam organizis
Erosperantan propagandan rondon por faciligi la taskon de
simpatiantoj disbategi la eropan babelturon.  Dum siaj kunvenoj
ili ue kaj oje kantas la Erosperantan himnon Het Hopo la la
melodio de La Espero.  Anka vi povas alii, parkerigante la i
supran tekston ...  ...  ...  u vi estas pretaj?  Bonege!  Unue
iu enmanigu flageton de la Eropa Unio kaj plenigu sian glason.
Komence ni ekkriu tri fojojn nian kuraigan sloganon.  Eis!
kaksi!  tres!:  Ero Spero Erosperanto!  Ero Spero Erosperanto!
Ero Spero Erosperanto!  Nun iu stariu sur sia seo, tralavu la
goron kaj, vigle svingante la flagon, koruse kunkantu:  Dans het
verdenon komis neosa gefuhlo...

Malfavoraoj por turismo</H2>
Nuntempe en Litovio ekzistas pli ol 300 turismaj firmaoj. Malgra
tiu i impona kvanto por tiel malgranda lando, plene pri
akceptado de eksterlandaj turistoj okupias e ne unu. La la
aserto de turismaj spertuloj momente ne eblas prosperi en la
merkato servante nur al venantaj turistoj.<P>
En multaj landoj i-speca entreprenado estas konsiderata kiel
eksporto de servoj kaj in subtenas kaj instigas la registaroj.
Tamen en Litovio i ekzistas en kondioj de duobla malavantao.
Estroj de la litova turisma borso inter la malavantaoj  mencias
troan senvalorigon de la usona dolaro kaj devigon por la firmaoj
pagi aldonvaloran imposton. Pro tio pluraj firmaoj rifuzas
okupii pri tiu entreprenado. La tata politiko tiuflanke kazas,
ke oktaga ekskurso tra la baltaj landoj Litovio, Latvio kaj
Estonio kostas same kiel unusemajna vojao al Florido kaj e
duoble pli ol restado en Mallorca proponmata de multaj firmaoj.
Malaktivion de la turismo anka kazas la nuna malfavora
krim-situacio en Litovio kaj malfacilaoj e interlimaj
trapasejoj.<P>
La litova turisma borso, al kiu apartenas 70 elcentoj de la
merkato por envetura turismo en Litovio, kaj kiu dum la sezono
akceptas centojn da turismaj grupoj, vivtenas sin nur danke al
elvetura turismo. Estroj de la borso komprenis, ke trovi sian
lokon en la merkato ili sukcesis nur pro ustatempa integrio kun
kunlaborantoj en Latvio kaj Estonio, ar eksterlandanoj preferas
vojaon tra iuj baltaj landoj. Aliaj turismaj agentejoj seras
profiton specialigante sian agadon. Ekzemple, la kompanio
``Gedimino Tours'' proponas servojn al sportaj fanatikuloj kaj
kunlaboras kun iuj sportaj federacioj de la lando.<P>
La turisma situacio en Litovio montras, ke malgra la asertoj de
la registaro doni al turismo prioritaton, momente rolas nur
klopodoj kaj mono de privataj firmaoj.<P>

Sekve al la multaj petoj de kontentaj uzantoj de la tekstprogramo
apelilo 1.0, Flandra Esperanto-Ligo nun povas prezenti al vi version
2.0 de la fama produkto de <I>Professional Consulting</I>.
<P>apelilo 2.0 estas kompleta profesia tekstprogramo, liverita en
bela ledsimila ujo, kun manlibro.

<P>
apelilo 2.0 kompreneble disponas
pri iuj ecoj, kiujn oni prave atendas de tekstprogramo:
<UL>
<LI>dikigo, kursivigo, substreko, trastreko
<LI>rektigo dekstren, maldekstren a amba, kaj centrado
<LI>iuj necesaj litergrandoj
<LI>tabeliloj
<LI>70 diversaj tiparoj, kun la necesaj literoj por tajpi
Esperanton kaj multaj aliaj lingvoj (inkluzive de la Skandinavaj
lingvoj)
<LI>eblo simple instali ankora aliajn litertiparojn
<LI>250000-vorta Esperanto-literumilo!
<LI>Atomata konvertado inter diversaj retsistemoj (cx, c^, ^c, ch ...)
kaj la veraj Esperanto-literoj. Eblo eksporti 7-bite por uzado en
HTML-paoj.
</UL>
Krome versio 2.0 regalas la uzanton per pluraj novaj aferoj:
<OL>
<LI><EM>Novaj tiparoj:</EM>
apelilo nun proponas e pli da tiparoj ol is nun.
Aldone pluraj el la malnovaj tiparoj ricevis kelkajn korektaojn kaj signajn
kompletigojn.
<LI><EM>Dividilo por Esperanto:</EM>
apelilo nun proponas profesian vortdividilon por Esperanto. i klopodas
dividi la radikoj kaj ene de tiuj la silaboj. Eblas
dividi tutan dokumenton, dividi ekde tajpsigno a maldividi ekde tajpsigno.
<LI><EM>Plia metodo supersigni:</EM>
Aldone al la isnuna metodo supersigni per la stirklavo, apelilo nun
permesas la aplikon de la cirkumfleksa klavo. Aldone la klavo W estas nun
komutebla inter W kaj .
<LI><EM>Ciferklavaro:</EM>
Nun estas eble komplete redifini la klavojn de la ciferklavareto per signoj
utilaj por la tekstprilaborado. apelilo venas jam kun difinoj por iuj specoj
de citiloj kaj kelkaj aliaj tipografiaj signoj.
Per tiu rimedo via klavaro nun havas 15 aldonajn klavojn, kiujn vi mem
povas difini.
<LI><EM>Aldonaj signoj:</EM>
En la apelilaj tiparoj la 12 Esperantaj apelitaoj anstataas iujn
Skandinavajn signojn. (Tio estis tenike nepre necesa kaj
vere neevitebla, por ke apelilo funkciu internacie en iuj nacilingvaj
versioj de Vindozo.) Tamen nun ni sukcesis minimume realdoni kelkajn el la
perditaj Skandinavaoj en la 8 ankora liberaj lokoj restantaj en la signaro.
Do la apelilaj tiparoj nun redisponebligas la Skandinavajn literojn (sen la
Islandaj).
Alivorte la amplekso de la signaro nun reegalas al LATIN-1, tamen plus
Esperanto kaj minus la Islanda.
<LI><EM>Bonigita kaj pli ampleksa literumilo:</EM>
La manipulado de la nacilingvaj vortaroj aniis jam tuj post la plej unua
subversio de apelilo. Ekzistas apartaj nometendaoj por distingi
nacilingvan vortaron de Esperanta.
Aldone estas menciinde, ke la amplekso de la vortaro preska duobliis kaj
ke i nun entenas iujn radikkombinojn el PIV.
<LI><EM>Aldonaj tekstformatoj:</EM>
Tiu versio de apelilo nun distingas inter pura x-formato kaj la apelila
xq-formato. Aldone estas nun eble malfermi miksformatan askian
dokumenton - ekzemple mesaon el Interreto. Krom tio estas nun eble lani
apelilon kune kun la dosiernomo de la malfermota dokumento.
<LI><EM>Trilingva dato:</EM>
La nova datfunkcio nun aldone enovas la nomon de la tago. i nun
kapablas tion trilingve, depende de la elektita fenestra lingvo.
<LI><EM>Dekstra musbutono:</EM>
En la unua ikonaro estas nun eble aldone apliki la dekstran butonon de la
muso por atingi kelkajn funkciojn parencajn al la precipaj.
<LI><EM>Pli longa historio:</EM>
La historio de us prilaboritaj dosieroj estas nun 8-era.
<LI><EM>Proverbaro:</EM>
Tre utile al iuj multoskribantoj, ni aldonis la kompletan tekston de la fama
<I><NOBR>"Proverbaro Esperanta"</NOBR></I>. Tiu senkosta aldono devenas de
la komputila reto Interreto.
<LI><EM>ABC:</EM>
Nova estas anka utila vortalfbeto por literumi e telefono.
<LI><EM>Tri ludoj:</EM>
Por distri vin aldoniis kelkaj ludetoj. Vi povas nun ludi rekte kontra la
inteligenteco de apelilo per
<UL>
<LI>Alumeta ludo
<LI>Kahela ludo
<LI>Memora ludo
</UL>
<LI><EM>Helpo pri helpo:</EM>
ar multaj uzantoj fakte ne konas la Vindozan helpsistemon tre bone, la
helpmenuo ricevis aldonan eron kondukantan al la nacilingvaj klarigoj pri la
principa uzo de helpejoj. Aldone estas menciinde, ke la helpejo en pluraj
lokoj estas konsiderinde pli detaligita.
<LI><EM>Manlibro:</EM>
Al apelilo 2.0 nun apartenas kompleta 60paa
manlibro kun iuj detaloj pri la uzado de la programo.
<LI><EM>Vindozo 3.1 kaj Vindozo 95:</EM>
La nova versio de apelilo funkcias ne nur sub Vindozo 3.1 kaj 3.11 sed
anka sub Vindozo 95.
</OL>
<H4>apelilo 2.0 kun iuj siaj avantaoj kaj kun la praktika manlibro
kostas nur 5130 BEF (= . 250 markoj, 168 dolaroj) plus afranko.<P>
Aetintoj de apelilo 1.0 ricevos disketojn per kiuj eblas transiri
al versio 2.0 kontra nur 2050 BEF (= . 100 markoj, 67 dolaroj)
plus afranko.</H4>

Oftaj demandoj pri apelilo</H2>
<OL>
<LI><H4>u estas akireblaj tiparoj por apelilo por la lingvoj rusa,
pola, ukraina kaj ina?</H4>
FEL vendas efektive disketon kun tiparoj por apelilo por la
lingvoj pola, rusa kaj ukraina. ia prezo estas 1000 BEF.
Tiparojn por la ina ni bedarinde ne havas.<P>
<LI><H4>u en apelilo 2.0 vi povas uzi piednotojn?</H4>
Piednotojn en la fino de iu pao ne jam estas ebligitaj en versio 2.0,
sed verajne en versio 3.0. Kompreneble estas eble meti piednotojn je la
fino de iu apitro.<P>
<LI><H4>Kiam aperos versio 3.0 de apelilo?</H4>
Professional Consulting promesis lani version 3.0 tuj kiam 500 ekzempleroj
de versio 2.0 estos venditaj. is nun vendiis 185 ekzempleroj.<P>
<LI><H4>Kiun aparataron kaj programaron oni bezonas por povi instali
apelilon?</H4>
286a procezilo minimume, prefere 486<BR>
4 MB da memoro, prefere 8 MB<BR>
8 MB da libera diskspaco, prefere iom pli<BR>
Windows 3.1, 3.11 a 95<BR>
prefere muso<P>
<LI><H4>Kiom kostas dua ekzemplero de apelilo?</H4>
Licenco por dua (a tria , ktp.) licenco por apelilo, ekzemple
por oficejoj, lernejoj, ktp. kostas 75 % de la normala vendoprezo,
do 187,50 DEM a 3850 BEF + afranko.<P>
<LI><H4>u per apelilo mi povas krei HTML-dosierojn?</H4>
apelilo 2.0 ankora ne atomate kreas HTML-dosierojn.
Vi do mem devos enmeti la ordonojn &lt;H1&gt;,  &lt;/H1&gt;,
ktp. Kiam via teksto estas preta, registru in kiel .lt3-dosieron.
apelilo lasos vin elekti inter la registrado kiel normala 8bita HTML-teksto
a kiel 7bita teksto. La neceso pri 7bitaj HTML-tekstoj iom post iom
malaperas.<P>
<LI><H4>Mi deziras malfermi cx-dosieron kiu nomias "esper", sed dare
apelilo plendas, ke i ne povas malfermi in.</H4>
Renomu in al "esper.cx" kaj la problemo malaperos.<P>

<H2>Lingva Ret-Gazeto - LRG-1</H2>
<H3>
Redaktoro: Boris Kolker. La retadreso: gh090@cleveland.freenet.edu
</H3>
<H4>Redakcia Konsilio: Gregoro Cejtin (RU), Duncan Charters (US),
Joseph Conroy (US), Christer Kiselman (SE), James Lieberman (US),
Jouko Lindstedt (FI), Alex Mikishev (IL), Carlo Minnaja (IT),
Goncalo Neves (PT), Paul Peeraerts (BE), Aleksandr Shlyafer (US),

</H4>
Karaj legantoj!
<P>Post la apero de mia afio "Lingva rubriko? Perfektiga kurso?"
en la diskut-forumo soc.culture.esperanto (s.c.e.) mi ricevis
amason da ret-mesaoj de s.c.e.-anoj (anka de Prezidanto kaj
enerala Sekretario de UEA, Prezidanto de ILEI, membroj de la
Akademio de Esperanto, aliaj kompetentuloj), instigantaj min al
tiuj du iniciatoj.
<P>Do mi faru provnumeron de Lingva Ret-Gazeto. La enro dume
ne estas difinita, kaj i parte dependos de viaj deziroj. Mi povas
promesi nur jenon: mi ne asos en s.c.e. tajp-erarojn kaj
perditajn akuzativojn; kaj mi ne premos tranilon al ies goro
kriante: "Kiel vi rajtas uzi tiun formon! u vi ne scias, ke
Zamenhof..., Fundamento..., Akademio..., PIV..., PAG..., Analiza
Skolo..."
<P>Mi intencas verki per klara lingvao evitante scienceskan
galimation. Aliflanke, mi ne emas kultivi simplismon: Esperanto
estas normala lingvo kaj devas esti uzata kiel normala lingvo.
Sed bonvolu ne konsideri min modela lingvouzanto: mi ne deziras
perdi mian liberon uzi la lingvon la mia plao kaj plezuro, kio,
kompreneble, ne signifas, ke mi intencas altrudi "mian" Esperanton.
Anka mi eraras (nur tiu ne eraras, kiu neniam ion faras), kvankam
ne ofte.
<P>Mi opinias, ke la gazeto devas esti interesa por iuj, kun
speciala atento al novuloj. Tamen i ne estas aldonao al pota
a alia elementa kurso. Precipe gravas por la gazeto viaj demandoj:
ili povas formi la vizaon de la gazeto. Do sendu ilin senene,
kaj mi klopodos laeble ilin respondi. La tre kompetenta internacia
Redakcia Konsilio ne lasos min fari multe da fuaoj.
<P>Pluraj personoj petis min sendi al ili per retpoto la novan
varianton de la leciono 1 el mia "Vojao en Esperanto-lando.
Perfektiga kurso de Esperanto" kaj ili ricevis in. Kredeble, nun
ili ronas graniton el la rokaro de Esperanto-lando. La leciono
plu restas en mia komputilo kaj povas veni anka al vi.
<OL>
<P>
<LI>*La artikolo.*
<P>La artikolo *la* estas uzata kun la substantivo signanta
aon, kiu estas konata al la askultanto (leganto): *Mi vidas
portreton* [iun]; *La portreto [nome tiu] estas originala*. La
artikolon *la* oni kutime ne uzas anta propraj nomoj, kvantaj
numeraloj, iuj pronomoj kaj la vorto *Esperanto* (kiun oni iam
skribas kun majusklo), krom maloftaj specialaj kazoj. Kutime oni
ne uzas *la* anka kun substantivoj en la rolo de predikativo: *Li
estas oforo*. Uzo a neuzo de la artikolo estas nepra nur en
sendubaj kazoj. En malpli evidentaj kazoj la artikolo estas uzata
lasence de la frazo.
<P>
<LI>*Vortkunmetoj.*
<P>En vortkunmetoj estas nedezirindaj la malfacile prononceblaj
amasioj de konsonantoj, pro kio la determinanta vorto povas esti
uzata kun la finao: *elektromotoro* (sed ne *elektrmotoro*). Por
montri la konsistigajn vorterojn, en la skribo oni povas kunigi
ilin per streketo: sport-klubo.
<P>
<LI>*La sufikso -in-.*
<P>Se temas pri profesioj, oficoj k.s., kiam aparteno al la ina
sekso estas esenca, la sufikso -in- povas esti uzata: *En la akceptejo
de la direktoro sidis simpatia sekretariino* (La parolanto
deziras informi, ke la sekretario estis virino); *Irena estas sekretario
retario de nia Esperanto-klubo* (La parolanto deziras informi, ke
Irena plenumas sekretarian oficon).
<P>
<LI>*La prepozicio PO.*
<P>La distribua prepozicio *po* (prenita el la rusa lingvo laforme
kaj la unu signifo) estas uzata, same kiel en la rusa lingvo,
nur kun la vortoj, signantaj la distribuatan objekton:
*deori po du fojoj en monato*.  Zamenhof hezitis, u uzi
nominativon (-o) a akuzativon (-on) post *po*, kiam temas pri objekta
komplemento, do li proponis gvidi sin per jena argumento: "ie,
kie oni dubas inter la nominativo kaj akuzativo, oni devas uzi la
nominativon". Tamen *po*, rilatante al numeralo (same kiel
*irka*
en la senco "proksimume"), fakte rolas kiel adverbo kaj tial
ne influas la kazon de la substantivo, anta kiu staras la numeralo:
*Mi pagis po (irka) dek dolarojn por peco*.
<P>
<LI>*Facilaj proverboj kaj aforismoj:*
Por bonaj aktoroj ne estas malbonaj roloj. - F. Schiller /i'ler/.
Kritiki estas tre facile. La tempo laboras por ni. - W. Gladstone
/Gled'ston/. Multe paroli kaj multe diri ne estas la samo. -
Sofoklo. Ni ne scias, kio estas ni, sed ni scias, kio ni povas esti.
- ekspiro. Kio necesas por domego, necesas anka por dometo. Kiu
vivos, tiu vidos. Kion vi volas, tion vi povas. Kia edzino, tia
edzo. Kiom da demandoj, tiom da respondoj.
<P>
<LI>*Lingva ludo "Determinato".*
<P>
Ne enrigardante en lernolibron a vortaron, trovu por la indikita
adjektivo kiel eble plej multe da substantivoj, konvenaj lasence.
Ekzemple: *nova - domo, maino...* Venkas tiu, kiu dum la certa
tempo trovis la plej grandan nombron da vortoj.
<P>
<LI>*Parolas Ludoviko Zamenhof:*
<P>"Mi kreis regulojn por vortfarado kaj per tio i mi
enportis grandegan ekonomion rilate la nombron de la vortoj ellernotaj,
ne sole ne deprenante per tio i de la lingvo ian riecon,
sed kontrae, farante la lingvon - dank' al la eblo krei el
unu vorto multajn aliajn kaj esprimi iujn eblajn nuancojn de la
penso - pli ria ol la plej riaj naturaj lingvoj. Tion i mi
atingis per la enkonduko de diversaj prefiksoj kaj sufiksoj, per
kies helpo iu povas el unu vorto formi diversajn vortojn, ne
bezonante ilin lerni. (Por oportuneco al tiuj i prefiksoj kaj
sufiksoj estas donita la signifo de memstaraj vortoj, kaj kiel tiaj
ili estas lokitaj en la vortaro).

<LI>*Maksim Gorjkij. PRI UNUO.* (Fragmentoj).
<P>Proksimume anta du jaroj, kiam mi lois sur la insulo Kapri,
venis al mi gastoj el Jakutio - Aleksej Semjonov, duonruso-duon-jakuto,
kun la edzino Nataa, inino el apud anhajo...
<P>Semjonov rakontis, ke li estas orfo, vivis - ajne, en
Troicko-Savsk - kiel helpanto e la magazeno "Kunst kaj Alberts", en
la libera tempo okupiis "pro enuo" pri lernado de Esperanto, sed
ellerninte in, ekdubis, u ekzistas homoj, kiuj parolas en tiu
lingvo. Dubo estas instrua, ne dubante oni ne konvinkias. Aleksej
Semjonov konvinkiis, ke Esperanto ekzistas, per tre originala
la maniero: li sendis en Londonon, al firmao, komercanta per as-birdoj,
telegramon en Esperanto, proponinte liveradi al la angloj
frostitajn tetraojn. Tetraojn li, certe, ne havis, sed la angloj
respondis al li same en Esperanto, do tiu lingvo ekzistas kaj,
sciante in, oni povas vojai en Eropo...
<P>Armita nur per Esperanto kaj traleginte kelkajn librojn pri
la historio de kulturo, li kun la edzino vizitis iujn efajn
urbojn de Okcidenta Eropo, estis en iuj muzeoj, trarigardis
aron da industriaj entreprenejoj kaj ege mirigis min per la
amplekso de memoro, originaleco de pritaksoj...
<P>Aleksej Semjonov estis elektita kiel financ-ministro de
Jakutio.

<LI>*El la "Struktura Vortaro de Esperanto" de Sergeo Rublov.*
<P>La fama tradukisto de la rusa poezio Sergeo Rublov postlasis
al mi manuskripton de sia "Struktura Vortaro de Esperanto", kiu
estas tre originala etimologia vortaro Esperanta-rusa.
<P>Jen fragmento el la Antaparolo:
<P>"La Struktura Vortaro pristudas vortojn, kiuj kreiis en la
kadro de nacia lingva evoluo, anta ol ili eniris Esperanton kaj
poste adaptiis al modernaj Esperantaj formoj. enerale, la
Struktura Vortaro estas reala, efektiva ponto inter naciaj lingvaj
trezoroj kaj internacia Esperanta leksiko.
<P>En la Struktura Vortaro spegulias diversnacia miljara lingva
evoluo, precipe de hindo-eropaj lingvoj, kiuj fariis fundamenta
kaj firma bazo por iutaga kaj iaspeca Esperanto. La
Struktura Vortaro montras la plej striktan konekson de Esperanto
kun la moderna diversnacia kulturo (sur la nuntempa scienc-teknika
bazo), kies konsekvenca produkto estas la lingvo Esperanto.
<P>En la Struktura Vortaro *grupias* diversaj vortoj, Esperantaj
kaj rusaj, kiuj parencas al unu sama pravorto a al unu sama
pravorta familio".
<P>Ni publikigos en LRG pecojn el tiu vortaro, foriginte la rusan
parton, tradukinte la ruslingvajn klarigojn en Esperanton kaj
iom redaktinte la materialojn.
