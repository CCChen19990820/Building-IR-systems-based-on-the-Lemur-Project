<P>
"Training how to use the technology by itself is <EM>not</EM> sufficient.
Teachers will only begin to use it when they are shown how to
incorporate the technology into their curriculum and lessons." The
following articles provide some examples of implementations of
technologies in education.

Wellburn, Elizabeth. "The Status of Technology in the Education System:
A Literature Review." May 1996.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.etc.bc.ca/lists/nuggets/EdTech_report.html">http://www.etc.bc.ca/lists/nuggets/EdTech_report.html</A>
<P>
This is an update of Wellburn's 1991 review of the research literature
related to technology and education, tracing changes and similarities
across the five year timespan. The author finds that "most of the more
current literature is overwhelmingly positive about the potential of a
variety of technologies to be powerful components in accomplishing
current educational visions."

<P>
Fryatt's paper, and the resources that accompany it, are intended to
provide some insights into possible answers to such questions as, "What
are the factors that distinguish successful Internet implementation and
training strategies from those that are not successful?" "What models
or approaches might be effective in reaching educators?" "What
systems/resources are necessary to support and extend the training
process?"

"In some ways, the Web is the ideal medium for presenting scientific
research. References to other research can include a hypertext link
that brings the reader immediately to the data being cited. And as the
body of electronic literature grows, readers will be able to burrow
ever deeper using references within references." In "Wired Science"
(<EM>Technology Review</EM>, vol. 99, no. 7, October 1996, pp. 42-51) Herb Brody
asserts that "labs around the world are in effect sharing a common
chalkboard--the Internet," and the Internet is "modernizing scientific
publishing and rendering it more efficient and inclusive." The Web
version of the article, which also includes many related links to other
Web sites and articles, is available online at

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>PROJECT TULIP AND THE DIGITAL LIBRARY</STRONG>
<P>
Project TULIP (<STRONG>T</STRONG>he <STRONG>U</STRONG>niversity <STRONG>Li</STRONG>censing <STRONG>P</STRONG>rogram), a five-year
collaborative project of Elsevier Science (publisher of journals in
science, technology, and medicine) and nine leading universities in the
U.S., that explored the feasibility of providing institutions with
networked, online access to scholarly journals, has concluded. The
project's final report presents some interesting conclusions: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Managing large digital collections locally is harder and more
expensive than managing a comparable print collection.
<P>
<LI> Users will only move to electronic publications when they find the
content they need in sufficient quantity. Having journals in electronic
form and bringing them to the desktop are necessary, but not
sufficient, conditions for the scholarly user.
<P>
<LI> Instead of less staff, most universities think they will need more
librarians in the future. They will be the ones leading users to all
kinds of information on all kinds of media.
<P>
<LI> While reading an article from the screen is not practical at this
moment, improvements in technology will change this. The infrastructure
is expected to become much "deeper and thicker" in the future: greater
bandwidth, better delivery mechanisms, more efficient protocols.

The President's Technology Literacy Challenge urges that the nation's
students be technologically literate by early in the 21st century.
"Getting America's Students Ready for the 21st Century: Meeting the
Technology Literacy Challenge: A Report to the Nation on Technology and
Education" was released on July 29, 1996, by the U.S. Department of
Education. The report outlines the Secretary of Education's plan for
meeting the President's challenge and for implementing the Improving
America's Schools Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-382) <BR>[see
<A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/legislation/ESEA/toc.html">http://www.ed.gov/legislation/ESEA/toc.html</A>]. <BR>

<A NAME="6"></A><STRONG>SCOUT REPORT FEATURES IAT'S WEB SITE</STRONG>
<P>
The <EM>Scout Report</EM> is a weekly electronic publication of Net Scout
Services and is provided as a fast, convenient way to stay informed of
valuable resources on the Internet. Its purpose is to combine in one
place new and newly discovered Internet resources and network tools,
especially those of interest to their primary audience: researchers and
educators. The service is designed for "Internauts" who want their
Internet announcements selectively filtered and summarized once each
week. Basic selection criteria include depth of content, author,
information maintenance, and presentation. The content of each resource
is briefly described.	
<P>
The IAT's Web site was featured in the September 13, 1996, issue of the
<EM>Scout Report</EM>. The report mentioned two of the projects of the IAT
Information Resources Group: the <A HREF="infobits.html"><EM>IAT Infobits</EM></A> archive and the
"Cybrarian's Desk" (at <A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/cybrary/cybrary.html">http://www.iat.unc.edu/cybrary/cybrary.html</A>).

<A NAME="7"></A><STRONG>IAT LIBRARIAN'S LINKS</STRONG>
<P>
The Information Resource Guide, "Library-Related Resources," has been
removed from our publications collection this month. It was originally
based on resources I used in my work as IAT librarian, but was badly in
need of updating. I have created a new publication with a revised and
expanded list of resources. I have titled the new publication "Online
Resources for the Solo Librarian" because it contains links that I
currently find useful in running a one-professional library. The new
guide is available at <A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/guides/irg-44.html">http://www.iat.unc.edu/guides/irg-44.html</A>.
<P>
Although most of the articles in Infobits are useful to all levels of
education, over the years we have included many with a primarily K-12
focus. Over 50 of these articles, covering the years 1994 through 1996,
have been compiled into an anthology arranged by title and subject.
"Anthology of K-12 Articles from IAT Infobits: 1994-1996" is available
at <A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/infobits/k12bits.html">http://www.iat.unc.edu/infobits/k12bits.html</A> (subject listing) and
<A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/infobits/k12bits-t.html">http://www.iat.unc.edu/infobits/k12bits-t.html</A> (title listing).

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Can Higher Ed "Jump the Curve"?</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>by <A HREF="mailto:bill_graves@unc.edu">Bill Graves</A></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>Management gurus and the books that make them are an interesting lot.</B> Their advice, in retrospect, usually seems common sensical and seldom profound when measured against the marketing hype their publishers generate to attract corporate readers. Reading <EM><A HREF="books.html#curve">Jumping the Curve</A></EM>, you might even wish you had grown up to be a business-school professor who wrote a best seller in 1994 noting the "epochal" changes underway in the commercial world and suggesting a process for "jumping the curve" to sustainable business success in the new millennium. For then, like authors <A HREF="http://www.usfca.edu/usf/mclaren/Faculty/Imparato.html">Nicholas Imparato</A> and <A HREF="http://www.usfca.edu/usf/mclaren/Faculty/Harari.html">Oren Harari</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.usfca.edu/usf/mclaren/">University of San Francisco’s McLaren School of Business</A>, you would have assured yourself a steady flow of corporate clients for your lucrative consulting practice, as well as an attractive income stream for you and your publisher. 

<P>But "hot" management authors often do us a service by crystallizing a few axioms for success and illustrating their efficacy both with inspiring, in-the-know exemplars and with sad, failed-to-get-it debacles. This is certainly the case with Imparato and Harari. So I’ll set aside any skepticism born of too much paradigm shifting during the last few years and treat their work with the due diligence it deserves.

<P>Imparato and Harari argue that civilization is in the midst of its third epochal (discontinuous) change. The first started in the Fourth Century and thrust the <A HREF="http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/classics.html">Classical Age</A> into the <A HREF="http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/labyrinth-home.html">Middle Ages</A>; the second started in the <A HREF="http://www.oir.ucf.edu/wm/paint/glo/renaissance/">Fourteenth Century</A> and eventually transformed the Middle Ages into the Modern Age. We are now, they say, on our way to the "Fourth Epoch," in which well-led organizations will "jump the curve" by tenaciously adhering to four "organizing principles:"

<OL>
<LI>"Look one customer ahead."
<LI>"Build the company around the software, and build the software around the customer."
<LI>"Ensure that those who live the values and ideals of the organization are the most rewarded and the most satisfied."
<LI>"Treat the customer as the final arbiter of service and product quality by offering an unconditional guarantee of complete satisfaction."</OL>

<P>Should these principles apply to a college’s or university’s information technology (IT) service organization? I nervously believe so, while only being certain that asking the question is an interesting exercise. More generally, I believe any college or university, public or private, would do well to ask to what extent its <B>overall</B> institutional goals and practices should reflect Imparato’s and Harari’s advice. Here’s why.

<P>Both looking one customer ahead and offering an unconditional guarantee of complete satisfaction imply an institutionally shared definition of customer and attendant service. Research universities might reasonably claim several customers -- students, faculty, and granting agencies, to mention just three. It is even arguable in the case of a public research university that the state is the primary customer -- buying the statewide socioeconomic benefit accruing from the university’s efforts in instruction, research, and public service. In any case, some members of some research faculties are inclined to treat their disciplines or professions as the customer, belying any institutionally shared sense of customer. Even among those institutions of higher education which might claim the student as the customer -- surely many community colleges and liberal arts colleges, as well as others -- how many would be willing to offer an unconditional guarantee of complete satisfaction? Would they be guaranteeing the quality of their faculty’s teaching or the quality of their students’ learning -- guarantees of input or of outcome?

<P>Ensuring that those who live the values and ideals of the institution are the most rewarded and the most satisfied is very problematic in the face of such mixed signals. For example, research universities, which may arguably be viewed as having differentiated customer sets, have done little to differentiate their reward structures accordingly. Or put another way, if those who live the values and ideals of a research university are being favored in its reward structure, then the evidence in most cases suggests that its sole customer is research -- the discipline or the grantor/contractor. Through these dissonant observations and questions, I am suggesting that mapping institutional goals and strategies against Imparato’s and Harari’s four organizing principles would be a revealing and worthwhile exercise for any college or university. 

<P>In such an exercise there is a basic perspective which, if adapted to institutional context, might position an educational institution to understand better how to "jump the curve." It is arguable that a primary goal of any educational institution is to create learning opportunities for its customers. From this goal arise a number of points of institutional differentiation. The choice of customer focus differentiates the nature and scope of an institution’s learning opportunities. Viewing faculty members as customers, for example, recognizes that scholarship and research represent learning at its deepest levels. From this vantage, some colleges and universities are creating subsidized learning opportunities for their faculties. That is, faculty experts are subsidized (paid) to advance the boundaries of knowledge and to provide related apprentice learning opportunities for students -- majors and graduate students. 

<P>A second point of differentiation is the degree of subsidy offered to different customers. Faculty subsidies (salaries) differ across institutional types, with smaller subsidies -- in community colleges, for example -- driving lesser expectations for individualized learning (research) opportunities and outcomes. In an inverse manner, student subsidies also differ, with smaller subsidies -- in private institutions, for example -- driving greater expectations for individualized student learning opportunities. And there are other points of institutional differentiation arising from the goal of creating learning opportunities for "customers," however defined.  

<P>Which areas of the knowledge base are to be included and at what depth? What will be the nature in time and place of these learning opportunities -- on campus in a classroom, in the workplace via real-time interactive video, at home via the Internet and its asynchronous communications technologies, in well equipped laboratories, in a research library? Will opportunities to certify "chunks" of learning (courses) be available and, if so, how? Will opportunities for institutional endorsement of overall learning be available in the form of degrees or certificates?  

<P>But I did not set out to contest traditional ideas about the nature and goals of higher education. So I’ll leave it to readers in the context of their institutions to decide whether there is merit in pushing further to map my proposed learning perspective, which can include the faculty as a customer, against the four organizing principles of Imparato and Harari. Meanwhile, I’ll get to where I thought I would be by now: relating their four principles to the work of IT service organizations in colleges and universities.  

<P>The four principles would have been as useful 15 years ago as today. By failing to look one customer ahead, central IT support organizations remained too wedded to the mainframe and minicomputer in the early days of the personal computer. In her recent article, <A HREF="http://minerva.acc.virginia.edu/~pam/homepage.html">Polley McClure</A> essentially argues that central IT support organizations in higher education may be at a similar blind spot today as they wrestle to balance a mix of central and distributed IT support services [see <A HREF="http://cause-www.colorado.edu/pub/ci/arc/CIN96may-jun.txt">CAUSE Information</A>, story #3]. The evidence for this includes the growing dissatisfaction with the central IT support organization being reported from campus after campus. There appears to be no easy way to look one customer ahead today, but IT professionals must do their best to understand the direction of the Internet and the Web and the <B>institutional</B> implications of their continuing phenomenal growth.

<P>Today’s rapid changes in technology and escalating demands for IT services in higher education make it difficult to contemplate offering an unconditional guarantee of complete satisfaction. Doing so would require a very careful delineation of IT services and the customers they support. But this is the point, and a good point. It would be necessary, for example, to understand whether a particular service is targeted at individuals or at a department or departments. E-mail is an example of the former and a facilities management package of the latter. Such distinctions were easier to make a few years ago than today. For example, is the customer for a student services package the office of student affairs or the entire university community? The answer should be the latter if the institution is committed to "building the company around the software, and building the software around the customer."

<P>Unconditional service guarantees also would require a change in attitude on the part of some IT professionals. For example, some of the most brilliant technical specialists are among the least service-oriented professionals. They frequently do not live the values and ideals of their organizations, yet they often are rewarded handsomely for their technical prowess. Imparato’s and Harari’s challenge in this area is an important one to any IT support organization hoping to treat the customer as the final arbiter of service quality. 

<P>All in all, the four principles for "jumping the curve" heightened my determination to understand and improve the experiences of those using the central IT services I oversee at my university. I am more determined than ever to link these services to institutional objectives. I am also determined to define available services more sharply and, equally important, to clarify what services are <B>not</B> available. Perhaps most intriguing of all, I now find myself engaged by the notion of service guarantees. Reflecting on the four principles could be dangerous to your <I>modus operandi</I> too.

<A NAME="1"></A><STRONG>EDITOR'S NOTES FROM SIGGRAPH 96 CONFERENCE</STRONG>
<P>
SIGGRAPH 96, the 23rd International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, was held in New Orleans, LA, on August 4-9, 1996. SIGGRAPH is the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics. The group promotes the acquisition and exchange of information and opinion on the theory, design, implementation, and application of computer-generated graphics and interactive techniques to facilitate communication and understanding.
<P>
Here are some notes on presentations at the conference that may be of interest to educators:
<P>
<A NAME="1a"></A>Virtual Gorilla Project: "Gorillas in the Bits"
<P>
The Virtual Gorilla Project is an educational tool being developed by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology's Graphics, Visualization and Usability (GVU) Lab and the Ph.D. program in the College of Architecture in conjunction with researchers and staff from Zoo Atlanta. The project is being developed as an immersive education tool to aid in the instruction of K-12 grade students in the interactions and behaviors of gorillas.<BR>

<A NAME="1e"></A>Storytelling: The World's Oldest Profession
<P>
Bran Ferren, Executive Vice President for Creative Technology, Walt Disney Company, is an award winning designer and technologist. He currently heads the theme park, master-planning R&D, and creative development team at Disney. He has won numerous awards, including three from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences for technical work on several films. Rather than focusing his presentation on new technologies in the entertainment industry, Ferren stressed the supremacy of the "story" (the content) over the technology that delivers it: "Emotional resolution is more important than screen resolution." He believes that the ultimate storytelling tool is the Internet, and predicts that the current and future tools will have the greatest impact in the area of education.<BR>

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>VIRTUAL EARTHQUAKES ON THE INTERNET</STRONG>
<P>
Virtual Earthquake (VEQ) is a web-based application that allows anyone with Internet access to become a "virtual seismologist." Designed by Gary Novak, a professor of geology, VEQ provides a "hands-on" lesson on how to locate an earthquake's epicenter and how to determine its Richter magnitude. Users interpret simulated seismograms from three seismic recording stations in an effort to triangulate the location of an earthquake's epicenter. The user's results are plotted on a map and compared to the actual results. 
Those who successfully determine an earthquake's location and magnitude are rewarded with a personalized "virtual seismologist" certificate of completion. VEQ is part of the "Electronic Desktop Project" at California State University at Los Angeles. Anyone with 
Internet access and a Web browser can run VEQ free of charge. You can visit Virtual Earthquake at

<A NAME="8"></A><STRONG>THE MONITOR -- NEW COLUMN ON IAT WEB SITE</STRONG>
<P>
The IAT has a new feature on its Web site. In "The Monitor," we will introduce to you new and current hot topics in instructional technology and related issues. We plan to feature a new column every two weeks, along with our regular Web site updates. These columns will come from IAT faculty and staff -- nationally recognized for their leadership in instructional technology -- as well as guest columnists. Using Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino, we also provide an area where readers can post their comments and discuss the issue with the author and other readers.
<P>
On August 15, we presented our first issue, "A Gutenberg Juncture: Changing the Model of Instruction in a New Technological Environment," by Tom Wason, who leads new projects in computer-based training and distributed learning at the IAT. Our next issue will appear the first week of September.

Virtual FlyLab (VFL), part of the Electronic Desktop Project at
California State University at Los Angeles, is an interactive Web site
for genetics instruction. Developed by Dr. Robert Desharnais, VFL is
being used by dozens of schools, colleges, and universities to allow
students to conduct genetic experiments by "breeding" fruit flies over
the Web and observing the patterns of inheritance in the offspring.
Students can also formulate and conduct statistical tests of
hypotheses. Anyone with Internet access and a Web browser can run
Virtual FlyLab free of charge. (Other virtual applications are under
development.) You can visit the Virtual FlyLab at

<P>
ContentsDirect is a free email alerting service for readers of Elsevier
Science journals. The publisher's service delivers tables of contents
by email approximately two to four weeks prior to a journal's
appearance in libraries. In February 1996, the service covered more
than 130 journals, and coverage will expand to more journals during the
year.
<P>

<P>
"The Web Maestro," an interview with Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited
with starting what we call the World Wide Web, is featured in the July
1996 issue of <EM>Technology Review</EM> (vol. 99, no. 5, pp. 32-40).
Berners-Lee talks about his vision of the future of the Web: "as you
wander around the Web, your computer will become encrusted with pieces
of software necessary to allow you to interact with and represent to
you the things that you're reading about. If you happen to be an
astronomer and you've been looking at spectra, then spectrum-analyzer
software will allow you to manipulate them. If you're a biology student
and you download some images of DNA molecules, then the code to send
this DNA will come with a little bit of software that allows you to
spin it around and break it up. . . . The very idea of software will
become a bit more submerged. It will be seen less as a discrete entity
that you go out and buy and more as a support to the objects that are
part of the information space. The software will move on and off your
machine without your having to worry about it." Read the article, along
with links to related information, on the Web at

<CENTER><H3>A Template for Converting Classroom Courses<BR> to Distributed, Asynchronous Courses</H2>
<A HREF="mailto:lowell_roberts@unc.edu">Lowell H. Roberts</A>, IAT Director (Interim)
<BR>[Latest Version: November 1, 1995]
<P></CENTER>
<HR><P>

<H3>1. What are the objectives of the course?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>NOT what you are teaching; not even what you expect students to do.
<LI>But WHY you are teaching it and why do you expect students to do it.
<LI>I.e., when the course is over, what should the students KNOW (defined as the capacity  to apply what they've learned to untutored situations) and UNDERSTAND (defined as the capacity to apply what they know to untutored abstractions)?
</UL>

<H3>2. Align current content with the objectives.</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Objectives should not need to be altered, but content (at least how it is presented)
              may undergo significant change.
<LI>This may seem simplistic, but the intent is to protect the integrity of the course -- i.e., to insure the distributed, asynchronous version achieves the same outcomes as the classroom version, as measured through the learning objectives.
<LI>Don't be disturbed if some content does not align with an objective.  The art of
             teaching rests as much on how we teach as what we teach; i.e., on stimulating
             interest, promoting understanding, facilitating transfer in a non-situated environment.</UL>

<H3>3. Based on the alignment of content and objectives, address the following questions:</H3>

<P><B>3.1.</B> What can be learned by discovery (constructivism) or peer interaction (collaboration), rather than direct instruction?  I.e., what do you feel you can                      surrender control of?
<UL>
<LI>Asynchronous communication places control of communication process and processing largely with each receiver -- almost the polar opposite of the lecture.
<LI>Teaching becomes facilitating and guiding, rather than instructing.
<LI>If you decide that control over most of the syllabus cannot be surrendered to the students (e.g., the course introduces skills or principles that are not efficaciously learned except by direct instruction), this is probably not an appropriate course for conversion to asynchronous delivery.</UL>

<P><B>3.2.</B> What content doesn't align with objectives?  I.e., what is covered that has little to do with outcome measures, but is included to promote student interest and/or
understanding?
<UL>
<LI>As students take increased control of the learning process (and given the
	   nature of asynchronous communication), there is little need (or time) for
	   content padding.
<LI>Students develop their own tactical approaches to understanding.  
	   [Obviously, this kind of learning is not for every student; nor is this kind
	   of teaching for every instructor.  But neither is the lecture.]
<LI>Rather than providing "the examples," the instructor must provide time 
	   and opportunity for the students to discover and apply "the examples" on
	   their own.</UL>


<H3>4. If you had a fully equipped multimedia classroom with a direct connection to the World Wide  Web and no time constraints, what would you do differently from what you do in the classroom now?  I.e., what learning and instructional activities and resources normally excluded from the standard classroom might you use to enhance interest, understanding and transfer.</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Imagine potential access to any library, database, data bank, publication, or
             individual in the world.	
<LI>Examine off-the-shelf software, CD-ROMs and videos -- think modular.
<P>Now leave the room.
<P><LI>You initiate use of this stuff and make yourself available as a guide or resource,
              but each student will be relatively in charge of her progress and mastery.</UL>

<H3>5. Based on your answers in 3A, 3B, and 4:</H3>

<P><B>5.1.</B> Design a course structure that will replace lectures as the primary means of realizing the course objectives -- e.g., a collaborative or self-paced environment.

<P><B>5.2.</B> Design activities that are appropriate to the environment -- e.g., team exercises or mastery modules; the outcomes of these activities should be measurable in
 terms of one or more objectives.

<P><B>5.3.</B> Design activities that provide direct instruction for those aspects of the course that require it -- e.g., a study guide or hypermediated, connected readings; again, the outcomes should be measurable in terms of the objectives.

<P><B>5.4.</B> Design procedures to help students pace and assess their progress -- e.g., complement self-pacing with electronic discussions or collaboration with
 benchmarks or periodic outputs.

<P><B>5.5.</B> Design methods of evaluation that are appropriate to the medium -- e.g., content-focused exams cannot measure learning outcomes of collaborative
 or constructivist environments.
<P>

<CENTER><H3>The Network as Strategic Asset: 
The Path to Learning Productivity</H3>
<A HREF="mailto:lowell_roberts@unc.edu">Lowell H. Roberts</A>, IAT Director (Interim)</CENTER>

<P>
Let's talk strategic investments in higher education -- where
should we be putting our money?      

<P>
Conventional classroom instruction will always have an important place in higher
education.  Real-time televised distance learning is a viable
and appropriate short-term solution to meeting instructional
demand in an environment of significantly reduced resources. 
But the wisest strategic investment, I believe, is computer
networking. 

<P>
Computer networks have major advantages over television or
conventional educational environments: 
<OL>
<LI>

<LIthey do not require
fixed spaces such as classrooms or studios; literally,
instructors teach and students learn wherever they are; 

<LI>their
use is not limited to fixed times; they are available to
instructors and students 24 hours a day; 
<LI>since
computer-delivered education is not bound by place or time, it
is demand-activated by each user and, therefore, 
consumes virtually no resources except when in use; 

<LI>they
provide a single infrastructure for most, if not all, university
functions and services: instruction, research, communications;

<LI>accordingly, networks can integrate the instructional and
management layers of curriculum delivery; and 

<LI>computer
networks permit individuals access to worldwide resources,
thereby centering the educational process in learning, rather
than teaching;  Of all investments, networks will prove easiest
to modify as future exigencies dictate -- a classroom can be
crowded or empty, but it cannot be expanded or contracted.    

</OL>

<P>
Networks, then, make the processes of education more productive.
 But perhaps their greatest advantage is their potential to make
the processes of learning more productive.  We long ago forgot
that teaching, a medieval invention, provides a virtual learning
experience.  Since students did not have access to primary
sources or resources, teachers created representations
(lectures, texts) to acquaint students with materials they could
not access or manipulate themselves.   Computer networks, on the
other hand, can provide access to primary sources and resources,
making learning experiences direct and real.  But conventional
schooling imposes on all learners and all learning the quality
and access constraints of an artifact of conditions 700 years
ago.  No wonder we are often unhappy with the results and with
the costs.

<P>
Since all the sensory tools of teaching and learning can be
digitized -- text, pictures, sound, moving images -- the
educational capacity of computer networks is probably limitless.
 In addition, education over computer networks can be asynchronous
(i.e., communication among users does not occur at a given
moment in time).  Thus, networks provide an educational
environment of enormous resources and great flexibility at a
fraction of the cost of conventional environments.  Students can
learn while working or caregiving.  Instruction can use multiple
media without special classrooms and draw on resources wherever
they are stored.  The same lesson can be received at home or work or in the dorm -- or
used in the classroom.  Learning can be self-paced or
cohort-paced. The gateway to learning productivity is the
computer network.

<P>

Contrary to popular myth, networked education is neither
expensive nor difficult to use.  A minimum home computer
configuration can be purchased for roughly $1000 and requires
only a standard telephone line for connection to a network. 
Many institutions have developed methods to permit even the most novice students to be fully
participating members of network classes with little or no
formal training.  Those who have tried the increasingly powerful
presentation programs or newer simplified authoring programs 
know that preparing mediated presentations is becoming as easy
as word processing.  Similar tools will permit faculty to
prepare multimedia modules for network delivery as easily as
they write lectures for the classroom.


<P>
Most technology-mediated forms of instruction are extensions of
conventional forms -- interactive television is certainly the
prime example.  Similarly, instructional uses of computing are,
largely, add-ons to traditional instruction.  The educational environment
created by computer networks, however, is a true paradigm shift.
 For this reason, and not for reasons of cost or complexity, the  academy will take longer to adopt networked instruction,
although it is becoming increasingly common.  And because it is
a paradigm shift, computer networking can be the foundation of a
more productive, cost-effective university of the near future.

<B>A Request for Partners</B>
<BR>from the
<BR><B>Institute for Academic Technology</B>
<BR>Under the Aegis of
<BR><B>EDUCOM's National Learning Infrastructure Initiative</B>
<P>
[<A HREF="#purpose">Purpose</A> | <A HREF="#educom">EDUCOM & NLII</A> | <A HREF="#work">Work Description</A> | <BR><A HREF="#participate">Who Should Participate</A> | <A HREF="#membership">Membership</A> | <A HREF="#joining">Joining the Partnership</A>]</CENTER>
<HR>

<H3>About the Institute for Academic Technology</H3>

<P>The Institute for Academic Technology (IAT) was conceived and established at 
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1989 with generous 
support from IBM Higher Education.  Now accounting for approximately 45% of 
the IAT's budget, IBM Higher Education's support continues to provide 
leverage for self-sustaining outreach programs and a variety of research and 
development contracts and grants.  

<P>As a university-operated national R&D 
center designed to foster collaboration between academe and the information 
technology industry, the IAT has helped many educational institutions, 
publishing companies, and instructional software developers strengthen the 
quality of their instructional programs and products by taking advantage of 
multimedia and network technologies.  These successes owe much to the IAT's 
resident technologists and faculty researchers.  Academic backgrounds at the 
IAT are in mathematics and second language acquisition and include extensive 
academic administrative experience, but the IAT's technology-transfer work 
with teachers, scholars, and academic administrators from across the nation 
has cut across the spectrum of disciplines, professions, and institutional 
types.

<H3><A NAME="purpose">Purpose</A> of the Partnership for Distributed Learning</H3>

<P>The Partnership provides an opportunity for institutions, organizations, and 
companies to work closely with the IAT and to benefit from its work and the 
leverage of the resources and expertise provided by IBM and other companies 
and funding agencies now collaborating with the IAT.  In particular, the IAT 
is directing its research and development efforts towards understanding and 
prototyping distributed learning environments.  The Partnership thus offers 
an opportunity for a selected number of Partners to help determine the 
direction of this effort and to benefit from it.  

<P>Because the World Wide Web has become an open standard for 
navigating and publishing on the Internet, the initial effort will be to 
develop requirements for tools that will enrich the Web as a medium for 
delivering courses and curricula.  These tools therefore must: 

<OL>
<LI>support faculty efforts to integrate Web-based learning resources into credit-bearing learning modules and courses, 

<LI>provide students with Web-based access to immersion learning software and related software for assessing learning outcomes, 

<LI>support Web-based asynchronous (time-independent) and real-time communications among learners and their instructors (learner to learner and learner to instructor), 

<LI>help structure and manage the instructional process when students, instructors, 
and learning resources are widely distributed, and 

<LI>support the creation of environments that encourage the social creation of knowledge among learners.</OL> 

<P>The tool suites that we envision must be standards-based and the alternative 
instructional models that they enable must be scalable and sustainable.  
These requirements must guide the effort whether the eventual costs of 
developing high quality distributed learning materials are borne by higher 
education or by the commercial sector.  Our effort accordingly will be 
designed to demonstrate an institutionally affordable and commercially 
viable model for creating and delivering distributed education -- courses 
and curricula.  

<P>Distributed learning environments promise scalable, cost-efficient solutions 
to the pressing, systemic educational problems that are being articulated 
and addressed in a national movement:  EDUCOM's National Learning 
Infrastructure Initiative (NLII).  Indeed, the Partnership is designed to be 
a vertical microcosm of the NLII, an effort to drill deeper into some of the 
concepts and goals that animate the NLII.

<H3><A NAME="educom">Relationship to EDUCOM's National Learning Infrastructure Initiative</A></H3> 

<P>Increasing the quality of instruction is only a partially sufficient 
response to today's educational challenge.  Economic and other external 
forces are pressuring educational institutions, not only to increase the 
quality of learning, but simultaneously to contain the cost of instruction 
and increase access to education.  This systemic challenge can be met only 
if many educational institutions, policy organizations, and companies in the 
educational market synchronize their efforts.  This is the goal of EDUCOM's 
National Learning Infrastructure Initiative.  The chief strategy of the NLII 
is to facilitate "Requests For Partners" as a means to spawn a variety of 
prototype projects designed to foster educational change, both at the level 
of practice and policy and with the goal of increasing quality and access 
while containing costs.  This document, then, is a request for partners 
under the aegis of the NLII.

<P>Institutions, organizations, and companies interested in joining the 
Partnership should consider joining the more comprehensive NLII if they are 
not already members.  Queries are welcome at <A HREF="mailto:nlii@educom.edu">NLII@EDUCOM.EDU</A>.  Participation 
in the IAT's Partnership, however, does not require participation in 
EDUCOM's NLII.

<H3><A NAME="work">Description of the Work</A></H3>

<B>Modus operandi: </B> Meetings of the full Partnership will provide an 
opportunity to 1) review new technologies identified or developed by the IAT 
or a Partner as potentially applicable to Partnership themes, 2) report and 
critique Partnership work in progress, 3) debate and advance the 
requirements for Web-based distributed instruction and learning, and 4) 
propose new projects and, when such proposals carry a price, determine 
whether enough Partners are willing to invest in the project to undertake 
it.  For example, the IAT might propose to port <A HREF="http://ike.engr.washington.edu/iat/software/express/index.html">Express Author</A>, its 
Windows-based multimedia authoring tool, to a networked cross-platform 
environment, such as Kaleida's ScriptX.   By virtue of its seat at the 
table, any Partner could choose to invest in this effort.  The porting 
project would proceed if enough investors stepped forward, and then these 
investors would determine, for example, issues of ownership and 
distribution.  Any Partner would have the same rights as the IAT to propose 
new projects, but the Partners can expect the IAT to develop agendas for the 
meetings and to propose well researched projects as part of the IAT's 
contribution to the Partnership.

<P><B>Electronic forum:</B>  Partners also will have the opportunity to participate in 
a closed electronic forum on the themes and work of the Partnership.  The 
IAT will organize some part of the discourse and Partners will be expected 
to organize other parts.  The forum itself first will be a listserv but will 
evolve into a distributed learning environment for the Partners' benefit.

<P><B>Participation in other IAT projects and programs:</B>  One of the benefits of 
participation in the Partnership is a close working relationship with the 
IAT.  The IAT will consider the Partners as potential collaborators in all 
of its projects.  This might include, for example, 1) "beta" access to new 
technologies, 2) various forms of participation in a project to develop 
distributed learning modules in college algebra and pre-calculus 
mathematics, 3) collaboration with a publishing company now working with the 
IAT to define and possibly undertake an English-as-a-Second-Language 
project, and 4) prototyping distributed learning environments in other 
curricular areas using tools identified or developed by the IAT.  
Participation in such efforts would be subject to the approval of their 
sponsors.  The IAT also will extend a 10% discount to qualifying Partners 
for its Affiliate Program.  (The <A HREF="../affiliate/affiliate.html">Affiliate Program</A> trains trainers to offer 
IAT-developed workshops on a regional basis at their institutions.  More 
information is available on request through <A HREF="mailto:mary_edeburn@unc.edu">Mary_Edeburn@unc.edu</A>.)

<P><B>Frequency and location of business meetings:</B>  The IAT will organize at least 
two meetings per year of the full Partnership.  At least one of these 
meetings will be held at the IAT.  If a site with appropriate infrastructure 
can be located, one meeting might be located closer to the west coast.  In 
addition, the IAT will report the progress of the Partnership at meetings of 
the NLII.  If there is reason to convene the full Partnership at any NLII 
meeting, all Partners will be welcome to participate in other NLII sessions 
as well, whether or not they are members of the NLII.  Up to four 
participants from each participating Partner may attend the business 
meetings.  Some Partners may choose to participate in specific development 
activities, and any related working meetings will be scheduled as needed and 
as conveniently as possible.  (Participants will pay their own travel 
expenses to participate in Partnership meetings.)  

<P><B>The work philosophy:</B>  The IAT's plan to research and prototype distributed 
learning environments will draw on 1) existing products and work at the IAT, 
2) any synergistic work that other Partners can bring to the table, and 3) 
emerging standards-based, commercial Internet/Web tools.  The long-term 
technical strategy is to design toward, and port tools and applications to, 
an object-oriented framework as independent of hardware and operating system 
as is possible.  Meanwhile, the IAT has several successful products to 
deploy in the effort:  WebApp, Express Author, MathKit, and a host of 
interlingual tools.  The IAT's plan to develop a distributed learning 
environment accordingly will draw on these products and will be focused by 
those content areas in which the IAT has faculty expertise:  mathematics and 
second language acquisition.  There is no requirement, however, that 
participating partners be interested in these products and content areas -- 
although some may be.  

<P><B>WebApp:</B>  The IAT has developed <A HREF="http://ike.engr.washington.edu/iat/software/webapp/index.html">WebApp</A> as a helper application for Web 
browsers that automates the downloading and running of application software 
into a single mouse click.  For example, until and if powerful application 
development tools are integrated into the Web environment, WebApp makes it 
possible to run immersion learning software from within a Web page in a way 
that is independent of the location of the learning software.  A Windows 
version of WebApp is already accessible through the IAT's Web site, and a Macintosh version is under development.  

<P><B>Express Author:</B>  <A HREF="http://ike.engr.washington.edu/iat/software/express/index.html">Express Author</A> is a tested set of point-and-click 
tools for creating interactive, multimedia ToolBook "books" in the Windows 
environment.  It was created with extensive input from academic authors, and 
the IAT offers training in its use.  Through Express Author, the IAT has become very 
familiar with ease-of-use features and with the issues involved in 
commercializing and distributing software.  The immediate opportunity is to 
utilize Express Author and WebApp in combination to create distributed, Web-based 
libraries of immersion learning materials.  The longer-term opportunity is 
to port Express Author to a networked cross-platform environment, such as that 
potentially provided by Kaleida's ScriptX.

<P><B>MathKit:</B>  <A HREF="http://ike.engr.washington.edu/iat/software/mathkit/index.html">MathKit</A> provides object-oriented mathematical functionality to any 
Windows software development environment, such as ToolBook or Visual Basic. 
 The result is a development environment giving authors access to reusable 
mathematical objects, such as 2- and 3-dimensional graphing windows and a 
scripting language with numeric and symbolic capacities.  Unlike 
self-contained computer algebra systems, MathKit is highly modular and 
extensible and was designed for creating mathematical learning materials.  
It has been extensively tested in K-12 and in higher education as the core 
engine of a commercial product, EduQuest's ToolKit for Interactive 
Mathematics, which recently was named by Technology & Learning as one of the 
"Top Six Products of the Year."  Additional MathKit-based authoring products 
will be released soon.  One of these products links MathKit into Express 
Author and Multimedia ToolBook 3.0.  MathKit has already been deployed in 
conjunction with WebApp to develop a prototype Web-based library of 
immersion learning modules in mathematics accessible through the IAT's Web 
site cited above.

<P><B>Interlingual tools:</B>  A team of authors at the IAT has produced writing 
assistant software for language study.  Language databases supply lexical 
and grammatical information, along with pronunciation assistance and 
culturally appropriate multimedia material for listening comprehension.  
These products, specializing in foreign language support for speakers of 
American English, demonstrate feasibility for network implementation and 
indicate that the model can be generalized for any pair of source and target 
languages.  The IAT hopes to prototype this generalization in the 
Internet/Web context, and this work will help inform the Partners' work in 
developing requirements for creating distributed learning environments.

<H3><A NAME="participate">Which Institutions and Companies Should Participate</A></H3>

<P><B>Higher education:</B>  Participating colleges and universities should be 
prepared to 1) send representatives to the Partnership's business meetings, 
2) participate in the Partnership's electronic forum, and 3) possibly invest 
in projects that will advance the development of distributed learning 
environments.  They will have additional in-kind opportunities to become 
involved in 1) the development or evaluation of content and assessment 
materials, 2) the development of technologies to organize and manage 
distributed instruction, and 3) the development of alternative course 
models.

<P><B>Commercial sector:</B>  Creating an affordable and sustainable distributed 
instructional environment will require the utilization of object 
technologies along with the quality assurance of collaborative institutional 
commitments and/or commercially produced materials and standards-based 
assessment vehicles.  This argues for the participation of companies hoping 
to develop markets in higher education as the "National Information 
Infrastructure" (NII) develops into an open, scalable system during the 
years ahead.  The IAT therefore hopes to attract companies from the content, 
testing, telecommunications, and hardware/software industries to participate 
directly or indirectly in the Partnership in ways that will enhance the 
development of their markets.  Indeed, the IAT's corporate partner, IBM 
Higher Education, views the Partnership as a vehicle to develop expertise, 
technologies, and business relationships as the foundation for doing 
business in a new era in the higher education market.  IBM Higher Education 
therefore will help the Partnership locate pertinent expertise and 
technologies, both within IBM's extended family of labs and product 
divisions and within its circle of potential business collaborators from the 
NII industry at large.  For example, some of the keystone tools for IAT's 
experiments in second language acquisition in a distributed environment were 
the result of years of work in an IBM research lab.  Moreover, IBM's K-12 
group, EduQuest, licensed MathKit from the IAT as the core engine for 
ToolKit for Interactive Mathematics, which was successfully introduced into 
the K-12 market early this year as an award-winning authoring and 
exploratory mathematical environment for students and teachers.  

<P><B>Other non-profit organizations:</B>  Foundations and government agencies are 
welcome to participate in a manner that contributes to their mission and to 
the work of the Partnership.

<H3><A NAME="membership">Resource and Membership Strategy</A></H3>

<P>The resource strategy has three primary thrusts:
<OL>
<LI>Each Partner will pay $5,000 annually for a seat at the table.  This 
fee will help defray the IAT's costs in organizing and managing the 
Partnership and will allow all involved to advance their generic 
understanding of distributed learning in a systematic way that relies on 
on-going work at the IAT and at participating institutions, organizations, 
and companies.  The IAT reserves the right to limit membership to 
approximately 25 Partners to ensure a meaningful experience for all 
participants.

<LI>Projects requiring additional investment will be proposed through 
the Partnership's business meetings and electronic forum.  Project proposals 
will include a business plan and a work plan.  The Partners will have an 
opportunity to discuss, shape, and invest in these projects at the 
Partnership's business meetings.  No project will proceed as a Partnership 
activity unless it gains enough investors for implementation.  These 
investors will then determine the particulars of the project.  Such projects 
may be proposed and sponsored by the IAT or by any Partner.

<LI>The IAT will inform the Partners of opportunities to participate in 
other projects and programs that have been organized and sponsored outside 
of the Partnership.  Some of these, such as developing immersion learning 
materials for ESL, college algebra, and pre-calculus mathematics, may 
contribute directly to the goals of the Partnership while requiring no more 
than in-kind investments from interested Partners.  Others, such as the IAT 
Affiliate Program, provide an additional opportunity for interested Partners 
to advance their institutional missions in close collaboration with the IAT 
by delivering IAT-developed workshops in their area of the country.   </OL>

<H3><A NAME="joining">Joining the Partnership</A></H3>

<P>The IAT welcomes immediate interest in the Partnership.  Members will be 
invoiced $5,000 in the fall of each year.  Any institution, organization, or 
company failing to pay its first invoice no later than 30 days after the 
fall meeting of the Partnership will be assumed to have decided against 
participation.  This fall's meeting is tentatively scheduled at the IAT for 
October 16-17.  Meanwhile, the current listserv, partners@unc.edu, will 
remain open to all interested parties.  If you want to be added to the list, 
please contact <A HREF="mailto:partners@unc.edu">partners@unc.edu</A>. 

<P>Your institution, organization, or company can join the Partnership by 
designating, in a letter or e-mail message, a representative to be the point 
of contact with the IAT.  Write to the IAT:

<P><HR><P>

<H3><A NAME="grant">Grant Activities to Date</A></H3>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</A> awarded a $30,000 planning grant to the Institute for Academic Technology (IAT) in June 1995. This planning grant funded IAT efforts to explore and define the requirements for using the World Wide Web as a means for creating distributed learning environments. Some of the funds in the planning grant were earmarked for convening several groups interested and/or involved in developing asynchronous learning environments, specifically the Partnership for Distributed Learning and selected Sloan Foundation Asynchronous Learning Network participants. Since then we have convened a meeting of the Partnership for Distributed Learning (PDL) in Keystone, Colorado. The Keystone meeting with the Partnership was held in conjunction with <A HREF="http://educom.edu/">EDUCOM</A>’s National Learning Infrastructure Initiative <A HREF="http://educom.edu/program/nlii/.index.html">(NLII)</A>. This meeting gave the IAT and prospective Partnership members the opportunity to explore issues related to using and evaluating the Internet and World Wide Web as a viable means to create and use distributed learning environments to deliver instruction.

<P>Several members of the IAT also visited the Sloan Center for Asynchronous Learning Environments <A HREF="http://w3.scale.uiuc.edu/scale/">(SCALE)</A> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Various faculty involved with the SCALE project demonstrated the way they used computer conferencing and Web technologies to conduct parts of their courses asynchronously. Discussions with SCALE participants presented some "real-life" experience using asynchronous tools to teach.

<P>Both groups (the SCALE project faculty and prospective PDL members) expressed similar interest in exploring all possible asynchronous tools and ways of using them in both on- and off-campus learning environments. A catalog of tools and capabilities mentioned included:  

<UL>
<LI>Conferencing over networks, both asynchronous and synchronous. Interests included text, audio, desktop video, whiteboard, data standards and language standards.
<LI>Multiple User Dimensions (MUDs) and MUDs-Object Oriented (MOOs).
<LI>Real Audio and Video (on-demand, streaming audio and/or video).
<LI>Multiple media windows.
<LI>Assessment tools.
</UL>

<P>The Partnership discussions also yielded a list of issues associated with the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web for not only delivering, but also managing learning environments. These included:

<UL>
<LI>Publishing standards:
	<DD>Authoring tools,
	<DD>Reading tools, and
	<DD>Multiple delivery formats. 
<LI>Registration.
<LI>Authentication.
<LI>Crediting.
<LI>Mapping available and new tools to appropriate functionalities in a learning environment.
<LI>Mapping learning objectives to appropriate resources, such as applications for learning and assessment.
<LI>Acquiring or developing templates from which to construct application prototypes.  
</UL>

<P>Many similar interests have been discussed on the Sloan Foundation listserv for the Asynchronous Learning Network <A HREF="http://www.sloan.org/education/aln/new.html">(ALN)</A> project sites. Participants expressed  the need for: finding a coherent approach to using Web-based delivery tools; defining the functionality for course management elements such as planning and implementing courses in a distributed learning environment; and developing an integrated system for registration, credit allocation and assessment.

<H3><A NAME="deliv">Delivery Tools</A></H3>

<P>The above list of Web and Internet tools demonstrates both the range of interest and the range of functionality already available for delivering content on the Web. Every week prototypes of promising new delivery tools appear.  

<P>Worlds, Inc. has debuted an intriguing multi-user environment that is a combination of a MOO and 3-dimensional modeling. Called <A HREF="http://www.worlds.net">Worlds Chat</A>, this application allows multiple synchronous users to join several types of 3-dimensional environments and chat with individuals or groups of up to six people within the environment. Individuals select "avatars" to represent themselves graphically as they move about the environment and interact with others through text-based dialogue. Tools such as this foreshadow the ability to create much more sophisticated virtual learning environments on the Web. In these learning environments participants could act individually or collaboratively, interacting with other individuals, with smart objects, or simulations. Interactive functions could go beyond text-driven dialogue to allow users to access and "use" objects in the environment, manipulating and changing the information attached to the object.

<P>Xing Technology Corporation recently announced the introduction of real-time television transmission over the Web. Its product, StreamWorks, will enable real-time radio networks, and soon thereafter, television networks over the Internet.

<P>Although interesting in themselves, these new products are more interesting because they confirm the advent of the all-digital multimedia communications world, the convergence of every existing analog medium over a digital network, accessible to individuals through their own computers. These emerging digital tools will be more powerful because they bring interactivity at every level, between individuals, among members of groups and with information itself. They also provide the means for individuals to analyze, manipulate, revise and redistribute information.

<P>These new delivery capabilities, and many more innovative ones, will continue to appear faster than we can imagine them. Although the commercial and entertainment industries usually drive the creation of these tools, most of them have basic utility for educational purposes. The challenge for educators interested in using the Web and the Internet for instructional delivery is not so much in creating these tools, but in understanding the functionality, the technical requirements for implementation and support, and the pedagogical advantages and disadvantages of the tools. This is especially true when new technologies are announced every day, each heralding new possibilities that we must analyze and assimilate into the existing repertoire.

<H3><A NAME="inter">Interaction Management Tools</A></H3>

<P>The Web itself does not provide sufficient ways for individuals and groups to interact among themselves. There are a few tools such as <A HREF="http://webnotes.ostech.com/">WebNotes</A>, Ubique’s <A HREF="http://www.vplaces.com/index2.htm">Virtual Places</A> and the aforementioned World Chat that provide relative degrees of interactivity. But they still do not support either the quantity or quality of interaction among students and teachers that is requisite for quality education. To solve this problem, many teachers have turned to Internet tools such as email, news groups and listserves to address the need for student interactivity. These tools can be helpful in many situations, but they are not inherently tailored to the demands of teaching. Teaching a course over the network via these basic Internet tools requires a lot of "overhead" for the teacher. He or she has to do background work to separate all the students' comments and arrange them according to the threads (topics) of discussion instead of the chronological and time-stamped order in which email and listserves typically handle comments. Otherwise, the multiple discussions may be too difficult to follow. Student comments also will not be appropriately referenced to the topic or individual respondent which the student is addressing.  

<P>Increasingly faculty are turning to specialized software which incorporates these features into a self-standing environment which can operate over the Internet or dial-up lines. To paraphrase Varrki George's comment during our visit to the SCALE center at UIUC: "The Web provides the means for delivering information; computer conferencing provides the means for student interaction." George uses computer conferencing software, along with Web-based communications tools, to teach his Urban Planning courses on campus. Other faculty in the ALN projects, as well as at other sites across the country, are using computer conferencing applications such as Lotus Notes, First Class, PacerFORUM, to deliver instruction on campus and/or off campus. These applications typically offer means for information delivery, interaction and archiving the information and interactions. They also address some security issues for the user and network. However, they do not address all the requirements for course management, especially when these applications are mixed with other Web or Internet applications.

<H3><A NAME="course">Course Management Tools</A></H3>

<P>Since the creation of communications tools is generally driven by industries other than education, course management tools are not available on the Internet; there is currently not a commercial market sufficient to justify their creation by the private sector. As mentioned above, there is a plethora of means for delivering content, but credit-bearing instruction requires more than individual access to content and interaction. It requires standards-based means to author and develop materials, and secure means to register, counsel and support students, as well as to assess their work. Issues of network security include authentication of the user (student input), confidentiality and integrity of the student’s work product. If the educational community cannot adequately address these issues, then the Web and its associated delivery tools will be limited to recreational learning and "edutainment”"

<H3><A NAME="net">Networks</A></H3>

<P>To this point we (the ALN and PDL communities) have discussed network access from the perspective of the Internet and dial-up lines into a server for a particular application such as computer conferencing. We should widen the scope of our investigations to examine the commercial online services and network providers. Online services such as America Online have established themselves as viable network services. Recent mergers, acquisitions and competitive entries in the industry indicate that the viability of these services has been accepted. New players such as Microsoft Network and the regional Bell services bring with them new technologies for development, delivery and interaction as well as the means to bundle applications with access. And, of course, they also provide entry to the Internet. Perhaps the most salient aspect of online services for education is that they are targeted to the home market. If access from the home is provided at a "reasonable" rate it could open up the market of home-based learners for education. Reaching these learners is presently problematic because network access and the availability of simple interfaces and software for instructional delivery is limited.

<P>However, online services operate differently from the Internet in several ways. The most obvious difference is that online services are commercial and that they offer a turnkey solution to users. They bundle access, interface, applications and content in one package. This is convenient for the user, but presents different obstacles to institutions wanting to use online services for the delivery of instruction. The financial plan must include payment to the service provider as well as the cost of content development which utilizes or is compatible with the online company’s own authoring environment. Similarly to the Internet, there are currently no means for handling course management. The point here is not that this type of network access is better or worse, but that it is different. It has some interesting potential advantages, but it also entails different requirements to utilize it. The final and primary point is that this type of network should not be ignored by education. We should analyze the possible benefits, the requirements for participating and the gaps in functionality within these services. They provide a resource for extending distributed learning environments to the home and we in the educational community need to understand this potential.

<H3><A NAME="meaning">Creating Meaning from the Asynchronous Learning Experience</A></H3>

<P>The IAT and the Sloan Foundation ALN participants are nationally positioned to explore the issues inherent in providing distributed instruction. By using the term "distributed instruction," we differentiate between the requirements for delivering content for casual learning and the more rigorous requirements for delivering credit-based degree programs. Within the combined collective of the Sloan Foundation's ALN project institutions and the IAT’s partnership institutions, we have a motivated, self-initiating group of faculty who are enthusiastic about exploring distributed and asynchronous solutions to their own and their institutions' instructional challenges. These faculty are dedicated to the quality of their teaching and their students' learning.  

<P>In order to make their experience meaningful to the broader educational community, we need to compare previous efforts to use asynchronous technology for teaching and learning, to develop case studies, and to understand and define the requirements for assessing student performance in asynchronous learning environments. Finally, from this combination of analyzing previous efforts and prototypes of new distributed learning environments which utilize an array of network-based technologies, we need to distill the functional capabilities necessary to provide distributed instruction. The basic modules of functionality will need to be delineated within and among the areas of content development, content delivery, interaction management, assessment and course management.  

<P>The Sloan Foundation had the foresight to seed ALN projects on many campuses. Its leadership in promoting the advantages of asynchronous technologies for education has provided the means to explore key issues challenging educational institutions today. But without the means to track these projects from planning through assessment, much of that information could be lost or obscured. The projects need to be studied both individually and collectively to determine what their experience means: What have we learned? What makes the use of these technologies viable, scaleable, replicable? What are the challenges and benefits from using them on campus and off campus? How can we use them to create new learning opportunities for students not currently in the educational market - those who cannot participate in classroom and campus-based instruction? To reap the full benefits of the Sloan Foundation grants requires a systematic effort to assist, analyze and evaluate the project outcomes. The IAT can do this. 

<H3><A NAME="iat">IAT's Leadership Experience</A></H3>

<P>Because of its national scope and particular focus on distributed instruction, the IAT provides a logical forum for the exchange and analysis of distributed instruction outcomes, as well as a fulcrum for leveraging the individual inquiries of many institutions beyond the scope of their own efforts. The IAT can collect the data from these various projects, and analyze and aggregate them. From this broad experiential base, the IAT can then devote the efforts of its faculty and staff to evaluate the work to date and further refine the functional requirements for distributed instruction.

<P>Unlike most educational institutions, the IAT has faculty and staff whose time is completely dedicated to researching and analyzing both the pedagogical and the technological aspects of distributed learning environments. Functioning as an "applied think tank," we focus on the strategic use of information technology to address critical issues in instruction and education. In the past we have demonstrated how existing multimedia development tools can be enhanced to provide different capabilities which ease the challenges of authoring while simultaneously creating more learner-centered applications. In particular, the prototyping of tools such as <A HREF="../../technology/software/express/index.html">Express Author</A> and <A HREF="../../technology/software/mathkit/index.html">MathKit</A> exemplifies what we learned from the process of analyzing the technological and pedagogical requirements for using multimedia tools to develop course content. To address the inadequacies of the Web for providing access to sophisticated multimedia courseware, we developed <A HREF="../../technology/software/webapp/index.html">WebApp</A> to automatically download and install these applications to a student’s computer. We have not pursued developing these prototypes from a desire to develop marketable products, but as a learning experience and as a means to prove and demonstrate our concepts. In this regard we are not only analysts and reflective learners, but also "hands-on" learners.

<P>For the past two years we have turned our focus from networked multimedia applications to the broader topic of distributed learning environments and the instructional and technological systems which enable them. In keeping with our national mission, we have initiated efforts to influence the national dialogue within the educational community concerning the issues of quality, cost and access. We feel that our ability to address these issues is strategically tied to our understanding and deployment of distributed technologies and learning environments. In particular, many of the asynchronous technologies provide new strategies for dealing with quality, access and cost.

<H3>New Joint National Learning Infrastructure Inititative</H3>
<P>One example of the IAT’s contribution to the national dialogue is its seminal role and continuing leadership in EDUCOM's NLII. As an example, the IAT recently brought together the principals from three other NLII projects to explore leveraging their individual efforts into a collaborative one to define functional modules for course management in a distributed environment. Representatives from the NLII projects at the University of Michigan, Miami-Dade Community College and California State University met with the IAT representatives to review their individual project goals and determine any common goals. After reviewing Miami-Dade's LAN-based Project Synergy Integrator (PSI), the group decided to form a technical task force immediately to investigate re-purposing some of the PSI code to develop a course management platform. The second stage of work will leverage the University of Michigan's plan to create an object-oriented system for developing application modules ("applets") with which faculty can construct their courses.

<H3><A NAME="conc">Conclusion</A></H3>

<P>Through this report we have illustrated the kind of supportive and synergistic function the IAT can provide to the Sloan Foundation's ALN project participants. We are continuing to meet members of this community and discuss their interests and goals. Through our ongoing participation with ALN faculty and projects we hope to deepen our own understanding of distributed learning and provide reciprocal value to the ALN community as well. Through our outreach services such as satellite-delivered programs, workshops and electronic media we can share the ALN experience with the larger educational community. By these means we can bring the collective experience of the ALN community to bear in the national dialogue on the strategic use of information technology in education.

<CENTER><STRONG><FONT  SIZE=+2><FONT SIZE=+3>PDL</FONT>: Summary of the Meeting of October 16-17, 1995 </FONT> </STRONG> </CENTER>
<BR>



<P>The Partnership for Distributed Learning, (PDL) held its first
business meeting at the Institute for Academic Technology on
October 16 and 17, 1995. A <A HREF="partrfp.html">Request for Partners</A> was issued by
the IAT at the January 1995 NLII meeting in New Orleans, and the
Partnership was organized in subsequent meetings in March and
June 1995. This meeting initiated the PDL as a national
consortium for research and development of Web-based tools for
distributed education.

<P>The following institutions and organizations attended the
inaugural meeting:

<UL>
<LI>California State University/California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo
<LI>Florida Community College at Jacksonville
<LI>Indiana University
<LI>Kent State University
<LI>Montgomery County Community College
<LI>Prentice-Hall/Simon & Schuster
<LI>San Mateo Community College District
<LI>Sinclair Community College
<LI>University of Colorado at Boulder
<LI>University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill/Institute for Academic Technology
<LI>University of Pittsburgh
<LI>Utah State University
<LI>Virginia Commonwealth University
</UL>

<P>Based on agreements worked out in the organizing meetings,
general business meetings of the Partnership are to have three
foci: 1) information about distributed education best practices,
state-of-the-art and next-generation innovations;  2) project
planning and management; and  3) PDL business affairs. This meeting was organized accordingly.

<H3>Information</H3>  

<P>Steve Griffin of the IAT presented an overview of the NLII
meta-consortium to develop standards for distributed course
management (DCMS). The genesis of this meta-project is the
exemplary <A HREF="http://www.mdcc.edu/synergy/psi.html">Project Synergy Integrator</A> (PSI) system developed by
Miami-Dade Community College, and its goal is to componentize
and scale the best features of MDCC's LAN-based system to the
Internet. The meta-consortium consists of MDCC, UNC-CH,
California State University, and the University of Michigan. The outcome of a meeting of technical representatives from these
institutions was a system definition providing for learning and
instructional flexibility, asynchronous use, support for legacy
courseware, mixed vendor compatibility, and compatibility with
emerging Internet standards for commerce and authentication. The Partners agreed that advanced knowledge of this long-term
project was extremely valuable and that, while it should not
postpone development of interim distributed course management
solutions, these solutions must adhere to the standards and
architecture evolving from the meta-project.  

<P>Best practice and state-of-the-art demonstrations were 
provided by:
<UL>
<LI>Virginia Commonwealth University: <A HREF="http://www.vcu.edu/mdcweb/demo.html">Web-based course delivery of
English, German, and health administration courses</A>.  
<LI>Kent State University: Multimedia Distributed Learning
Initiative incorporating live and taped video, sound, graphics,
and text.
<LI>California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo:
multimedia applications.  
</UL>

<P>A next-generation technologies demonstration was provided by the
IAT showing Java applications, three-dimensional chat
conferencing, and streaming video and audio. This demonstration
included a discussion of Sun's Java and the new features
incorporated into Netscape Navigator 2.0, Navigator 2.0 Gold,
Live Wire, and several other Netscape products. The
implications for standards-based distributed instruction were of
interest to all.

<H3>Projects</H3>

<H4>Projects were proposed by:</H4> 
<OL>
<P><B>Indiana University . . .</B>
<P><LI>Development of modules and tools to improve students'
mathematical thinking and reasoning and to improve problem
solving ability. While intended primarily for preparing
elementary teachers, the modules and tools will be appropriate
for the general developmental math curriculum.
<LI>Development of Web-based interactive tools for mathematics
across the curriculum.

<P><B>Virginia Commonwealth University . . .</B>
<P><LI>Instructional Web: A Server in a Box - Cross-platform
software permitting instructors easily to set up courses
on-line, deliver content, control user access, and handle course
administration functions.
<LI>Web Presentation Software - A toolkit to permit live full
media instructional presentations on the Web.

<P><B>Institute for Academic Technology . . .</B>
<P><LI>Development of JAVA-based mathematical graphing applets.
</OL>

<H4>Decisions on the proposals:</H4>

<P>The Partners agreed to begin work immediately on 3 of the 5
proposals, designated below as Projects 1, 2, and 3. The
initial phase of each of these projects will include defining
specific outcomes and developing work and business plans. Indications of Partner interest in participating in projects are
preliminary and identify, primarily, those that wish to be
involved in this first phase. Final decisions to participate in
a project will be based on the work and business plans. The
Partners also agreed to undertake a fourth, longer term, project
that would be built on the results of Projects 2 and 3.

<P><B>Project 1</B> - Proposal 3 (VCU) : Immediate priority as an interim solution
building toward the DCMS. Estimated time to complete: 6-8
months from start. VCU will take the lead. IAT will seek      
 third-party funding. Preliminary Partner interest: Technical: Colorado, Prentice-Hall, UNC/IAT, Utah State and Kent State. Instructional design/functionality: Montgomery County CC, Pittsburgh, San Mateo, UNC/IAT, Sinclair CC, Florida CC at Jacksonville and Cal Poly.

<P><B>Project 2</B> - Proposal 1 (Indiana): Immediate priority. Indiana will take the
lead and work with IAT to prototype content in MathKit. Preliminary Partner interest: Content: IAT, Montgomery County
CC, Pittsburgh, Prentice-Hall, and possibly Colorado.

<P><B>Project 3</B> - Proposal 5 (IAT): Immediate priority. IAT will take the lead
and work with Indiana and other Project 2 institutions on
content. Develop prototype modules for 2D and 3D graphing and
maybe 1-2 additional prototype modules in JAVA. Develop plan
for making MathKit JAVA-based and for porting initial Project 2
modules to JAVA. Preliminary Partner interest: Colorado,
Pittsburgh, Prentice-Hall, and possibly Indiana. 

<P><B>Project 4</B> - Based on the outcomes of Project 2 and 3, build JAVA-based
MathKit and JAVA-based MathKit modules (content identified in
Project 2). IAT will take the lead. Estimated time to
complete: 1 year. Major funding will be required; those
contributing to cost will share license; third-party funding
will also be sought.   

<P>Proposal 2 (Indiana): Tabled by Indiana pending outcomes of
Projects 2, 3, and 4. 

<P>Proposal 4 (VCU): Based on the demonstrations of next-generation
Web streaming tools, VCU withdrew the original proposal and
suggested, instead, that the Partners consider developing the
means for CD-ROM access from within the Web -- i.e., making it
possible to launch CD-ROM based materials from Web-based
instruction and learning environments. Steve Griffin and Bill
Pet of the IAT developed and demonstrated a prototype during the
meeting.  

<H3>PDL Business</H3>

The membership fee has three purposes. First, it is intended to
ensure commitment to the work of the Partnership and to
encourage each member to be an active participant. Second, it
is to provide for the management of the Partnership, meetings
and coordination of projects. Third, these funds will be used
to leverage additional funds.  

<P>Some projects will require additional financial investment,
although others may be accomplished through in-kind
contributions, such as content or programming. Most will
probably require both. When a project is proposed, Partners
will indicate their interest. The proposing institution will
convene the interested parties to develop work and business
plans. If necessary, these plans will be brought back to the
full Partnership for additional consideration. It was agreed
that all proposals deserve a chance to advance, but a process
must be in place to establish priorities and even to winnow out
some ideas. Issues such as ownership of content and royalties
will be worked out in the business plan. Institutions that
elect not to invest in a particular project cannot benefit from
its revenues, if any, but all Partners may receive some
benefits, such as beta products.  

<P>The Partners agreed that, besides providing capacity to leverage
individual institutional resources for larger and more rapid
research and development, the PDL has added value in
centralizing consortium management, project coordination,
analysis and evaluation, and information dissemination. As
Robert Pack said, institutionally we must have a base from which
to make choices and "this enterprise is a lot cheaper than
hiring the expertise to go it alone."    

<P>There was some discussion of increasing membership, with a
consensus that about 25 partners would probably provide a good
mix of institutions and organizations without diminishing the
value of each member's seat at the table. Greater
representation of the commercial sector is needed, particularly
from the telecommunications and software industries. There was
also agreement that close articulation with the ALN projects
funded by the Sloan Foundation would be valuable.

<P>The Partners agreed to hold 2-3 full membership meetings a year,
in addition to project-specific meetings. The next general
meeting will be held approximately one month after the January
NLII meeting. However, meetings of the project groups will be
held in conjunction with the NLII in New Orleans on January 21. Members felt that the NLII sessions should be used to
familiarize others with the work of the PDL and to familiarize
ourselves with what others are doing.

<P><B>Sponsor:</B> Institute for Academic Technology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

<P>The Partnership for Distributed Learning (PDL)  held its first business meeting at the Institute for Academic Technology on October 16 and 17, 1995.  A Request for Partners was issued by the IAT at the January 1995 National Learning Infrastructure Initiative (NLII) meeting in New Orleans, and the Partnership was organized in subsequent  meetings in March and June 1995.  The October meeting initiated the PDL as a national consortium for research and development of tools for distributed learning environments.

<P><DT>Charter members of the Partnership for Distributed Learning:
	<DD>California State University/California Polytechnic State University - San Luis Obispo
	<DD>Florida Community College at Jacksonville
	<DD>IBM Higher Education
	<DD>Indiana University
	<DD>Kent State University
	<DD>Montgomery County Community College
	<DD>Prentice-Hall/Simon & Schuster
	<DD>San Mateo Community College District
	<DD>Sinclair Community College
	<DD>University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill/Institute for Academic Technology
	<DD>University of Pittsburgh
	<DD>Utah State University
	<DD>Virginia Commonwealth University

<P>The PDL is a leveraging organization through which the members extend their individual capacities to develop and implement distributed learning environments.  Partners get smart together by sharing information about best practices, state-of-the-art applications, and next generation innovations; share risk (and reward) in advancing distributed learning technologies through PDL-managed joint-venture projects; and mutually finance projects through in-kind resourcing and leveraged third-party funding.  PDL members pay an annual membership fee of $5000, the purpose of which is to encourage each Partner to be an active and committed member; fund PDL management, meetings and project coordination; and leverage additional funds.  

<P>Currently, the PDL has two projects underway.  One led by Indiana University will result in the development of modules and tools to improve students' mathematical thinking, reasoning and problem-solving ability.  While intended primarily for preparing elementary teachers, the modules and tools will be appropriate for the general developmental math curriculum.  The second project, Web Course in a Box, is led by Virginia Commonwealth University and will result in cross-platform software permitting instructors easily to set up courses on-line, deliver content, control user access, and handle course administration functions.  Two long-range projects are in the conceptual stage: Web-based interactive mathematics modules and tools and a platform-independent distributed course management system.

<P>The next business meeting of the Partnership will be February 19-20, 1996.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="wcbu">Update on Existing Projects</A></H3>

<H4>Web Course in a Box (Virginia Commonwealth University)</H4>

<P>Robert Godwin-Jones demonstrated the Web Course in a Box
prototype-in-development. The WCB prototype includes templates
for: 1) setting preferences; 2) course home pages; 3) Message Box for student interactivity (e.g., discussions); 4) class lists; 5) student home pages; and 6)
faculty home pages. The prototype can be accessed at
<A HREF="http://www.mmd.vcu.edu/wcb/wcb.html">http://www.mmd.vcu.edu/wcb/wcb.html</A>.

<P>Lyle Barton (KSU) demonstrated an intelligent quiz software that
Kent State has developed that will serve as a model of the drill
and practice component of WCB.

<P>Godwin-Jones raised two questions about the design of WCB: 1) To
what extent should WCB be specific to Netscape 2.0, which has
desirable features, but may limit universal usability?  2) To
what extent should WCB be modular, thereby permitting faculty to
use and update components, rather than the entire package. The
prototype is not modular, but the Partners agreed that
modularity is preferred. Steve Saltzberg raised the issue of
multimedia. Right now WCB works just with media available via
the Web. The Partners felt that WCB, in this phase at least, is
for faculty just beginning to use the Web for instruction and
learning. Their consensus was to keep WCB as simple as possible
to maximize its utility for faculty; more sophisticated
instructors can write their own html media plug-ins. The PDL
applauded the development team for the WCB's basic structure,
especially its feedback and interactive functions, and the fact
that the design will work for add-ons to classroom instruction
and televised distance learning, as well as Web-based courses.

<P>Steve Saltzberg presented a business plan for Alpha development,
and nine members agreed to put up $1000 each to complete the
Alpha phase and to serve as unsupported Alpha test sites.

<H4><A NAME="mathu">Math Tools for Teachers</A> (Indiana University)</H4>

<P>Gary Wittlich distributed a revised development plan, Web-Based
Modules on Mathematics for Elementary Teachers, prepared by
Gary, Enrique Galindo and Frank Lester. The revised plan
specifies 14 modules and a timeline for development beginning
fall 1996, with testing beginning a year later. Discussion was
deferred to the project meeting.

<H4><A NAME="dcmsu">Distributed Course Management Standards</A></H4>

<P>Steve Griffin (UNC-CH/IAT) updated the PDL on the status of the
Educom initiative to specify a standard for distributed course
management and develop a proof-of-concept prototype system. The
DCMS standard is now essentially defined, following a meeting of
the technical group at the NLII in January. Educom is calling a
meeting of interested technology companies (publishing,
telecommunications, software) to explore a business plan for
developing the prototype. Three proposed approaches are
currently under consideration: 1) Vendors put money into a
general development fund in exchange for a seat at the design
table and universities get compensated for developing the core
code; 2) The vendor development fund compensates universities
for both core code and proof-of-concept prototype; and 3)
Universities develop core code without vendor support--say,
with grant funding--and put it on the market free.

<H3><A NAME="wglm">New Proposal</A></H3>

<H4>Working Group on Learning and Motivation (Florida Community
College at Jacksonville)</H4>

<P>Jack Chambers proposed that PDL members form a working group to
examine academic technology from a pedagogical perspective,
specifically learning and motivation. Areas of potential study
are motivation of lower-level students as their instruction is
off-loaded to technology; appropriate mix of technology and
traditional modalities; how does technology promote good
teaching; what works for whom. The group may use PDL projects
as research testbeds, and its findings will inform future PDL
projects. Representatives of five member institutions agreed to
form the working group.

<H3><A NAME="smart">Getting Smart</A></H3>

<P>A key purpose of the Partnership is to be exposed to and
understand the latest developments in academic technology. Thus, attendees receive demonstrations of and discuss new
applications of technologies by member institutions and
state-of-the-art developments within the academic technology
industry. These demonstrations inform PDL and individual member
activities and projects, provide feedback to developers, and
create a dialog between the academic and commercial sectors that
promotes more useful and scalable products. The Partners thank
the following for their presentations:

<UL><LI>Anna Seu and Tom Fowler (Cal Poly): Shockwave animations and a

<P>Much of the discussion that followed the Addison Wesley Longman
and Simon & Schuster demonstrations focused on the business
models for developing and distributing products such as those
shown. Concerns such as return-on-investment, traffic to linked
Web sites, billing models, institutional support costs, and
local customization were raised. As a result of this
discussion, Kevin Johnson agreed to convene a working group on
business models, and all member institutions indicated they
would join. Initially, Simon & Schuster will propose models for
PDL reaction via the Partners List. The List discussions,
moderated by Kevin, will inform face-to-face discussions at PDL
meetings. Kevin and Bill Graves, convener of the Economics of
Electronic Publishing RFP group of the NLII, will coordinate the
work of the two groups.

<P>The WCB project meeting included eighteen people representing a
dozen institutions or businesses.  The meeting focused on two
topics: an implementation strategy and a business plan.

<P>I. Implementation Strategy

<P>The development partners (VCU and Kent State) agreed to develop
an "alpha" version of the WCB by June 1 so that our design
partners can deploy and evaluate the product during the summer
(several institutions wanted to use this as part of faculty
development efforts this summer). The alpha release will
contain the following elements:

<OL>
<LI>Class web pages (create and edit)
<LI>Faculty web pages (create and edit)
<LI>Student web pages (create and edit)
<LI>Asynchronous Discussion Group
<LI>Account ID/password access restriction
<LI>Syllabus
</OL>

<P>We will attempt to add the ability to create pointers to
instructional content and an online evaluation of the WCB
process.

<P>Ten institutions, aside from Kent State and VCU, made an initial
agreement to be a test site for the WCB alpha version, and
indicated a willingness to pay the development partners to be an
early test site. Several institutions need to get final
budgetary approval. The preliminary list of
test sites include IAT, Sinclair CC, University of Pittsburgh,
Acadia University, University of Alberta, UNC Chapel Hill, Utah
State, Cal Poly, and Prentice Hall.

<P>II. Business Plan

<P>The discussion centered around defining the copyright and
ownership issues for the WCB software and the equity of the
development and design partners. The business plan also needs to
address the "life of the project" and identify possible funding
strategies if the WCB is to become more than a prototype. Other
business plan issues were commercialization of project,
bring product to market in a rapidly changing environment, role
of publishers, market analysis, and resale options. Kent State
will make a first run at this business plan. (Steve Saltzberg)

<H4><A NAME="mathr">Math Tools for Teachers</A></H4>

<P>On Monday, Feb. 19, a group of persons interested in the math
project met to discuss how the partners might proceed. Attending
were Ladnor Geissinger and Jurgen Sladeczek (IAT), Jeff Cepull
(Pitt), Milt Petruk (U Alberta), Geneva Taylor (Sam Houston SU),
and Gary Wittlich (IU). Also expressing interest but not in
attendance was John Mastroni (Montgomery CC). 

<P>Enrique Galindo responded from Bloomington via telephone to
questions raised about the project description distributed at
the meeting. Of particular concern were which modules to focus
on and especially which tools to try to develop among those
Enrique listed in the proposal (2-D graphing, scientific
calculator, table generator, math notation editor, and a white
board to support both synchronous and asynchronous student
collaboration). Milt Petruk raised the question of whether it
might be better to distribute the tools by CD than to try to
integrate them with a web browser. (Milt later demonstrated
visual graphing tools developed at the University of Alberta and
available for campus license). The group also discussed problems
of porting MathWright tools to Java vs. creating the tools anew.
It was decided that if web integration remains the goal for the
tools, then creating them anew for the project is probably
advisable due to the complexities involved in a port.

<P>No conclusions were reached at the meeting about starting points
for tool development. Gary Wittlich will distribute materials
pertinent to two of the modules to members who have not seen
them. In the meantime, Ladnor will contact Maple developers to
determine whether it might be 
possible to license or otherwise use some of the Maple tools in
the project. Gary has created a majordomo list for the math
group and will use it to discuss project details, including the
possibility of submitting a partnership grant proposal to NSF to
support development of the tools. 

<P>Given that the modules for T104 were developed originally under
NSF support, and given the breadth of the partnership, some of
the members think that a proposal to support at least the
development of some prototype tools might be favorably viewed by
NSF, or perhaps by FIPSE. (Gary Wittlich)

<H4><A NAME="wglmr">Working Group on Learning and Motivation</A></H4>

<P>The following persons attended the meeting:

<UL>
<LI>Jack Chambers, Fl CC at Jacksonville (co-Chair)
<LI>John Mastroni, Montgomery Co. CC (co-Chair)
<LI>Byron Burnham, Utah State University
<LI>Katy Neff, Sinclair CC
<LI>Lowell Roberts, IAT
</UL>

<P>The group brainstormed on the overall problems concerned with
the application of research findings in the areas of learning
and motivation to higher education distributed learning.
Agreement was reached to attempt to identify the groups most
concerned, the most relevant research in the areas, and suggest
"best and worst" practices in applying research findings to
higher education distributed learning. Unanimous agreement was
reached that current practices
in higher education classrooms would not be used as a model
unless they conformed to research findings in learning and
motivation. Finally, it was agreed to develop a white paper on
the topic for distribution to the Partnership and elsewhere.

<P>The first step was taken, in identifying the most relevant
concerned groups. They were identified as faculty, students,
administration, professional staff, Boards of Trustees,
accreditation agencies, professional associations, and last but
not least, textbook and software publishers.

<P>These discussions will continue via a Work Group Bulletin Board. (Jack Chambers)

<LH></LH>
<DT><STRONG>ATM</STRONG><DD>Asynchronous Transfer Mode is a data networking standard adopted
by telephone and computer networking companies internationally.
 ATM has many advantages with respect to transporting digital
video.  It can support a variety of connection speeds.  It can
provide a dedicated amount of bandwidth between network devices,
and it introduces only small amounts of delay across network switching
devices.<P>
</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>AVI File</STRONG><DD>A video file format defined by Microsoft.  It can contain
digital video in an uncompressed format or in one of many compressed
formats.<P>
</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>Bandwidth</STRONG><DD>Bandwidth from a general data perspective is the maximum
number of bits per second that can be reliably transmitted at
any given time between two devices.  The devices could be connected
via a network or could be in the same machine as is the case of
a CD-ROM drive and a computer's processor.  <BR>
<BR>
From a digital video perspective, bandwidth is often referred
to as the minimum number of bits per second required during playback
such that no video or audio is lost.  In general, the higher the
bandwidth of a digital video file, the higher the perceived quality
of the video when it is played back.<BR>
</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
However, people who create
digital video files must often sacrifice video quality by compressing
the video in order to achieve a bandwidth low enough that it can
be supported by the delivery device, such as a CD-ROM drive.<P>
<DT><STRONG>CODEC</STRONG><DD>(COmpressor/DECompressor) generally a program that may or
may not interface with specialized video hardware to compress and
playback digital video in a particular digital video format. 
Common digital video formats are MPEG, INDEO, Quicktime, and CINEPAK.<P>

</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>Compression</STRONG><DD>When video is converted into a digital format, it
consumes large amounts of space - too large for most storage and
delivery devices.  Therefore, the raw digital data is reduced
(compressed) by various techniques including eliminating redundant
information in the video such as unchanging background images,
reducing the number of frames, or reducing the resolution.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Decoder</STRONG><DD>Digital video decoders convert digital video data back
into moving video and audio on the computer screen.  Decoders
can be hardware or software-based. 
</FONT>
<HR><FONT SIZE=+2>
Software decoders can be differentiated
by their scalability, or in other words their ability to provide
an optimized playback quality based on the performance capabilities
of the host computer.  Indeo from Intel is one of the better scaleable
decoders.  Software-only MPEG decoders currently do not provide
a great deal of scalability. High end Pentium class computers
are often times fast enough such that a software-only decoder
can display full-screen video at 30 frames per second.  As prices
for MPEG decoder chips fall, one can expect to find them more
frequently as standard elements of computers, as they are now
in IBM's Aptiva line of computers.

</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>Delta Frames</STRONG><DD> Visual information that has changed between two points
in time in video.  Delta frames are one technique to compress
digital video by storing only the information that changes.  If
a digital video file contained a segment of someone talking into
the camera, then delta frames might include only the lips and
other facial elements that move during the segment.
<P>

<DT><STRONG>Encoder</STRONG><DD>Encoders convert video from a traditional analog format
used in broadcast TV or output by VCR's etc. into a digital format.
 Encoders always include some hardware element that converts the
analog signal to a digital signal.  
</FONT>
<BR><HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Some encoders, such as the
Intel Smart Video Recorder Pro, also contain specialized hardware
that will compress the digital video at the same time.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Frame Rate</STRONG><DD>The number of times per second that the original video
is sampled and converted into a digital format.  Frequently CD-ROM-based
video is created at 15 frames per second.  Normal TV is displayed
at 30 frames per second and theater movies are filmed at 24 frames
per second.  Digital video frames can be a combination of key
frames and delta frames.
</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>Jitter</STRONG><DD>The variation in the delay in receiving data across a
network.  
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Key Frames</STRONG><DD>A frame of digital video information that has a complete
representation of the video at the moment in time when the frame
was encoded.  A key frame can be thought of as a snapshot of the
video at a moment in time, whereas a delta frame only stores data
that has changed over time.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Latency</STRONG><DD>The delay in receiving data across a network.
</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>Quality of Service</STRONG><DD>Generally used in referring to the ability
of some networks, such as ATM, that can guarantee a minimum amount
of dedicated bandwidth from one device to another on a network.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Quicktime</STRONG><DD>Digital video services and digital video programming
interfaces defined by Apple computer and built-in to the Mac operating system.
</FONT>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2>
<DT><STRONG>Resolution</STRONG><DD>The number of pixels or dots horizontally and vertically
represented in each frame of digital video.  When video is captured
the resolution can be reduced to decrease the size of the digital
video file.  The lower the resolution, the more detail from the
original video is lost.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Video for Windows</STRONG><DD>Digital video services and digital video programming
interfaces defined by Microsoft and built-in to Windows.

<CENTER><H2>WebApp (16-bit) Downloading and Installation Instructions</H2></CENTER>
<P><HR><P>
The following instructions tell you how to install the 16-bit
30-day trial version of WebApp. This version runs on Windows 3.1
and Windows 95. It is fully functional.
<OL>
<LI><A HREF = "wa_note.html">Download</A> (1MB) a copy of WebApp. The
downloaded file is named "wa16demo.zip". When your browser
asks you where to save the file, put it in a new empty temporary
directory (e.g. C:\TEMPDIR\).
<LI>Unzip the file (wa16demo.zip) into the same directory using WinZip or PKUNZIP.EXE.
<LI>Run the program "wa16demo.exe". This will place
all of the files needed to run the custom setup program for WebApp
on your machine in the temporary directory.
<LI>Before running the extracted "setup.exe", you should
save a bookmark to this page and then close your web browser because
the setup program will modify the configuration settings of the browser.
If you close the browser after WebApp makes these changes, then
the changes may be overwritten when the browser closes.
<LI>Run the "setup.exe" program. This program is the
WebApp custom setup program and will install WebApp on your machine
in a new directory (default C:\WEBAPPS\). After it installs webapp, 
then you will see a message indicating if it was successful in 
configuring your browser. [Note: WebApp's custom setup program will not change your autoexec.bat, config.sys or .ini files.]
<LI>You may now delete the temporary directory you created in
step 1.
<LI>If your browser was configured successfully by the setup program,
then you are ready to try out WebApp. If WebApp could not configure
your browser, then you must configure it yourself. Do this by
adding "webapp16.exe" as a helper application (also called
external viewer) for the MIME type "application/webapp."
This can be as easy as downloading this sample <A HREF="waxman.wai">chess program</A>
and supplying the location of "webapp16.exe" when prompted
by your browser. See WebApp's on-line help for more information
on how to get your web browser configured.
<LI>Now that you have WebApp installed and your Web browser properly
configured, you are ready to visit the <A HREF = "wa_arch.html">software archives</A>
to begin experiencing the dramatic difference that WebApp can
make in browsing software on the Web.
</OL>

<P>
If you have questions or comments regarding these instructions
for installing and configuring WebApp, we would appreciate hearing
from you. Send email to <A HREF = "mailto:webapp@unc.edu">webapp@unc.edu</A> or call 919-405-1927.

<H3>BlueJay Lispware</H3>
BlueJay Lispware, developer of <A HREF="http://isaac.engr.washington.edu/mathwright/">Mathwright</A>, a tool that uses the Mathkit mathematics engine for creating interactive math and science applications, had a problem.  They were attempting to use the WWW to distribute their runtime program and example content applications from an archive of interactive applications.  Even with a custom setup program for their runtime program, they found that many of the visitors to their WWW site could not complete the installation process successfully.
<P>After evaluating WebApp, BlueJay Lispware decided to scrap their custom setup program and convert their interactive math and science archives into WebApp compatible form.  Now, visitors to their site using any MS Windows-based WWW browser and WebApp simply click on the Mathwright Player reference in the WWW page and the player is downloaded, installed and launched automatically without any further interaction by the user.  After the player is installed with WebApp, individual interactive math and science books are downloaded, installed, and executed with a single mouse click.
<P>"WebApp makes it possible to automate the process of downloading the reader as well as books chosen by the user.  The decompressing of the reader and book directories, the creation of the Windows group and its corresponding icons, and the launchings of the reader with the corresponding book are all handled by WebApp.  Since one of our goals is to make these resources available to relatively unsophisticated users, the automation of the process provided by WebApp will be especially important.  
<P>"WebApp is simple to  use and will be an important tool for providing software resources via the internet."

<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The Institute for Academic Technology (IAT), the developer of WebApp, is part of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and funded in part by IBM to advocate and facilitate at a national level the use of technology for learning.  The IAT has been working on a variety of fronts to utilize the WWW as a front end to distributed learning environments, where desktop computers and networks facilitate communication between users and provide access to all types of educational resources, including software applications.
<P>One of the problems in distributing educational software today via the Internet is the multi-step process required to get an application composed of multiple files off the net and run it.  Because the WWW transmits a single file when a link is selected, authors of software usually compress all of an application's files, such as multimedia resources, databases, etc., into a single file -- often referred to as a ZIP file.  
<P>When the end user clicks on a reference to an application in a WWW page, the file is retrieved from the WWW server.  Then the end user must do the following in order to run the application.
<OL>
<LI>Create a new directory.
<LI>Move the single compressed file into the new directory.
<LI>Uncompress the file.
<LI>Read an installation instruction file.
<LI>Run the installation program or manually install the application based on the installation instructions.
<LI>Run the program.
<LI>Create a desktop icon for subsequent uses of the application.
</OL>
<P>The steps outlined above are a time consuming distraction for the sophisticated user and are clearly too difficult for the less technical user. The IAT appreciates the level of simplification that must be reached in order to open the Internet up for distributed learning to the broad base of current and future Internet users who lack sophisticated technical skills.
<P>For this reason, the design goal for WebApp was to reduce the software installation and execution process to a single mouse click on a WWW page.
<H3>How WebApp Works</H3>
<P>After WebApp is installed with its custom setup program, the user must configure his/her WWW browser to recognize the MIME type "application/webapp."  This will allow the browser to run WebApp when the user retrieves a file stored in WebApp format.  WebApp will automatically configure the Mosaic browser from NCSA and the Netscape browser from Netscape Communications.
<P>The user then displays a WWW page that includes a reference to an application that is stored on the WWW server in WebApp format.
<P>After the user clicks on the reference in the WWW page, the file is retrieved by the browser to the local machine.  When the file has been received, the browser launches WebApp.
<P>WebApp then performs the follows actions:
<OL>
<LI>Creates a subdirectory.
<LI>If virus protection software is available, virus checks the file before and after dearchiving files.
<LI>Dearchives the file into its component files.
<LI>Runs the application's setup program, if applicable.
<LI>Creates a program manager icon for the application in a program manager group of the user's choice.
<LI>Establishes entries in the MS Windows registration database -- also known as setting an "association" -- if applicable.
<LI>Runs the application.
<LI>After the user exits the application for the first time, WebApp will prompt to uninstall the application.
</OL>
<P>There are a number of other options that allow the user to control various aspects of this process.  However, if the default settings are used, then no interaction is required from the user.
<P>The end user can configure WebApp to use whatever virus scanning software is available as long as the software accepts command line parameters.  WebApp's online help includes Internet addresses where freeware or shareware virus scanning software can be downloaded.
<H3>Other Uses for WebApp</H3>
<P>WebApp is applicable for much more than distributing educational 
software and updates.  Besides automatically downloading and playing 
multimedia scripts on client machines, Web users can take advantage of 
WebApp to download software demos and then automatically uninstall them 
after examination.
<H3>WebApp Archives Format</H3>
<P>Creating files in WebApp format is simple.  No fees or royalties are 
required.  WebApp was designed to work with whatever archiving software an 
author wishes to use.  WebApp's online documentation includes Internet 
locations where shareware or freeware archiving software can be found.  

<P>The basic steps in creating a WebApp archive file are:
<OL>
<LI>Create a WebApp archive configuration file.  Online instructions and examples are provided with WebApp.
<LI>Create an archive file that includes all of the application's files and the WebApp archive configuration file.
<LI>Create a self-extracting version of the archive file.
<LI>Rename the self-extracting archive file's extension from EXE to WAI.
<LI>Place the file on a WWW server
</OL>
<P>[One of the server's configuration files must be updated to include the "application/webapp wai" MIME type.  This change is very simple and is only necessary the first time a WebApp archive file is placed on the server.]
<P>Steps 2-4 are done automatically with tools provided with WebApp.
<H3>Distribution of WebApp</H3>

<P>To enable users to install an application via WebApp, it is necessary
to package the application according to the WebApp protocol:
<OL>
<LI>Create a WebApp configuration file.
<LI>Create a self-extracting archive file of your application
plus the WebApp configuration file. (NOTE: Be sure to check the license for your archive software for any possible distribution restrictions.)
<LI>Change the <CODE>.exe</CODE> extension of the archive file
to <CODE>.wai</CODE> 
<LI>Put the <CODE>.wai</CODE> file on your Web server, then create a link to the associated file on your Web page.
</OL>
<P>The protocol is the same for 16- and 32-bit versions of WebApp
whether your application is 16- or 32-bit. Extensive information
on how to create and test WebApp archives is provided in the on-line
help that comes with WebApp. If you are interested in creating
a WebApp archive for your application, you may wish to download
some <A HREF="mkwebapp.wai">tools and examples</A> that will assist
you in this process.
<P>If you create some files in WebApp format for distribution on
the Internet, please let us know so that we can add your WWW site
to our list of WebApp <A HREF="wa_arch.html">software archives</A>.

<FONT  SIZE=+1>The State of the Browsers...</FONT>

<P>The state of VRML browsers reflects the state of the technology.  In looking over as many browsers as I could get my hands on, I've come to one simple characterization that applies to them all:  the first pimples of adolescence.  Though VRML 1.0 standard exists and the 2.0 standard is being announced and settled as we speak, the browsers haven't quite gained the discipline needed to meet the needs of users.  Like adolescents, they're searching to find themselves, and most of them aren't making too much headway.

<P>The youth of the interfaces alone hinder any sense of the 3D space on the 2D flatscreen.  From Pioneer to WebSpace to Lived3D, the means of "moving" within the 3D space is clumsy, like the teenager who just jumped four shoe sizes and shot up six inches--in a year.  Pioneer gives you almost nothing to go on when it comes to movement in the 3D space.  WebSpace tries to give the first-person perspective of riding a space sled complete with throttle and funky nobs.  WorldView offers the most intuitive movement interface with its three arrow-button palates that give you at the least a sense of what direction you'll be moving.  Bear in mind, though, that movement in these 3D spaces is nothing more than a shifting of perspective.

<P>
Multimedia computer systems combine a variety of sensory inputs such as
audio, video, still photos, and animation with the text and
number-oriented interactivity and flexibility of the computer.  The
combination of these elements provides a more natural interface, the
ability to present information in a wide variety of forms and formats,
and a degree of interactivity unavailable before.  This results in
systems which have been shown to be much more effective in such
applications as training and education, sales and marketing,
entertainment, and other areas than their "monomedia" predecessors. 
While the concept of multimedia computing has been around for some
time, only in recent years has a combination of evolving standards and
declining costs made multimedia systems practical enough for widespread
use.
<P>
As Multimedia based systems mature, their development closely parallels
the early days of the microcomputer.  When microcomputers first became
widely available, applications written for individual PC's were
developed, improved, and ultimately widely adopted by users.  Then,
with the proliferation of these separate computers, came the need to
share information and expensive peripherals between multiple users and
their computers.  This in turn led to the development of
microcomputer-based Local Area Networks (LAN's).  LAN's were then
followed by Wide Area Networks (WAN's), and variations such as
Campus-wide networks, Enterprise networks, and Global networks.
<P>
Multimedia systems and applications are improving and rapidly gaining
acceptance by computer users.  As this happens, questions are arising
about sharing multimedia materials and related peripherals.  The
logical progression of this leads next to the need for and the
development of multimedia capable networks.  
<P>
This document will help explain the requirements of, and some solutions
for distribution of multimedia over a network.  It will first examine
the two broad categorizations of multimedia distribution systems
(analog and digital) and the relative merits of these systems.  Then a
more detailed examination of the technologies involved in digital
multimedia will be undertaken. 


<H3>Types of Multimedia Networks</H3>

In order to explain the requirements of networked multimedia, we must
first examine the two types of data  and signals which may be
distributed to the network users.  Traditional video (i.e., television)
and audio (i.e., radio) signals are composed of continuously varying
(analog) electromagnetic waves.  The senses of sound and sight are
inherently analog-wave-based.  VCR's, laserdisks, audio cassettes, and
records all use electrical or mechanical methods to store and re-create
these waves.
<P>
While analog signals are the norm for human beings, digital signals are
the native mode for computers.  Digital signals represent data as a
series of 1s and 0s which can be transmitted, manipulated, and stored
by the computer.  Analog signals, such as sound, can be digitized for
handling by a computer through a process called sampling.  Basically,
sampling breaks down an analog wave into smaller pieces, and represents
those pieces digitally (1s and 0s).  When needed, the computer can take
this digital data and re-create a wave similar to the original.  If
done properly, any differences between the two waves (the original and
the digitally re-created) will be indistinguishable to humans. 
Computer disks, compact disc audio (CDs), and digital audio tape (DAT)
are all examples of digital storage devices.
<P>
Analog distribution systems which can coexist with, but operate
separately from a digital computer network have existed for some time. 
Traditional television distribution systems, along with matrix-switched
video and audio distribution systems are examples of these systems. 
While these systems perform some functions very well, digital networks
have a number of significant advantages.


<H3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Networks</H3>

The single biggest advantage of digital distribution of multimedia is
the ability to integrate and control the resulting audio and video
signals in the computer environment.  This provides a number of
significant benefits.  Once these signals are in the digital
environment, they can be analyzed, manipulated, and controlled like any
other type of data.  Over the last several years, digital processing of
video signals has revolutionized television, movie production,
satellite data analysis, weather tracking/forecasting, and numerous
other areas.  Incorporating audio and video signals into the digital
network environment promises to similarly revolutionize desktop
computer usage.
<P>
Another significant advantage of the digital processing and
distribution of these signals can be seen in the way computers are
used.  Computers' inherent interactivity and control are encouraging
development of entirely new methods of training, education, and
entertainment.
<P>
Finally, because digital signals can be duplicated perfectly, digital
data can be transmitted over long distances, copied, edited, enhanced
and otherwise modified, generation after generation, without loss of
signal quality.  Error correction available in digital networks can
insure the integrity of the final signal.
<P>
Even with these advantages, digital distribution is not yet widespread
because of some differences between analog and digital signal
distribution.  Among these differences are the distance information can
be effectively transmitted, and the quality of sounds and images
transmitted.


<H3>Transmission Distance / Scope of Distribution</H3>

Mature technology exists to transmit analog signals to large numbers of
viewers over virtually unlimited distances.  Television signals which
are frequently broadcast over wide areas are a common example. 
Existing satellite technology allows these analog signals to be sent
virtually anywhere with little degradation in quality.  Since these
signals are one-way, it is relatively simple to add additional
receivers without affecting quality.
<P>
Digital transmission is currently less well suited to very long
distance transmission.  Digital transmissions' size,  and their
frequent two-way nature are more than many transmission media can
currently handle.  For example, wireless networks, which transmit data
in much the same way that broadcast TV transmits video and audio
signals, are currently much slower than traditional (i.e., Ethernet or
Token-Ring) networks, which themselves are not always adequate for the
demands of multimedia (as will be seen later.)  


<H3>Signal Quality</H3>

Distributed signals' quality can be perceived by users in two main
areas, audio quality and video quality.  Broadcast television, with
which most people are familiar, gives a good standard for comparison.
<P>
In general human beings can hear sound in the frequency range of 20Hz
to 20,000Hz.  This then is the "ideal" maximum bandwidth for sound. 
While the reproduction of these sounds varies from one television to
another, a very good TV, or one whose audio is channeled through a
stereo amplifier should be able to reproduce most of the 20-20,000Hz
spectrum.  Digitally recorded audio quality varies depending on the
sampling rate and sampling width (bit depth) at which the original
analog wave is converted to digital.  A sampling rate of 44KHz (44,000
samples per second) will provide the full 20-20,000Hz spectrum.  If it
has a 16 bit sampling width it will have CD quality noise levels. 
However, this also creates very large files.  Because of this, other
sampling rates (22KHz, 11KHz) and bit widths (8 bits) are used when
lower quality audio is acceptable.  An 11KHz sampling rate will produce
a spectrum encompassing approximately 20-5500 Hz.  (For comparison, the
audio sent over standard telephone connections covers the frequency
range from 300Hz through 3,000Hz.)  This slower sampling rate will
significantly reduce the storage requirements of the recorded sound. 
Switching from a 16 bit sample (65,536 volume levels) to an 8 bit
sample (256 volume levels), will significantly increase the noise
level, but will halve the storage requirements.
<P>
A television picture consists of a matrix of dots (or pixels) whose
visible portion measures 484 rows by 360 columns.  By combining various
combinations of red, green, and blue, the pixels on a TV screen can
display a range of approximately 16 million colors.  The color pictures
created by the television are delivered at a rate of 30 frames per
second, providing the illusion of smooth motion.
<P>
As with audio, there are varying levels of digital video quality. 
There are three areas in which the video quality can vary in a digital
system.  These are the size of the reproduced picture, the range of
colors in the picture, and the speed in frames per second (FPS) at
which the video is reproduced.  To accurately reproduce the quality of
a traditional television, a digital system should create a picture with
a resolution of 640 rows by 480 columns (full-screen standard VGA),
24bit color resolution (16.7 million colors), and a frame rate of 30
FPS.  As with digital audio, this requires a tremendous amount of
storage.  As a result, video images are often stored in smaller screen
sizes (i.e. 320x240 or 160x120), with fewer colors (i.e. 8 bit
resolution, 256 colors), and slower frame rates (minimum of 15FPS for
motion).


<H3>Digital Distribution Methods</H3>

<H4>Differences Between Multimedia Networking and Traditional Networking</H4>

There are numerous factors which distinguish multimedia network demands
from traditional (data-oriented) networking demands.  Key among these
are the differences in size of multimedia and traditional data files,
and multimedia data's isochronous (time-sensitive) nature.
<P>
A quick look at the data files associated with audio or video reveals
that these files can be orders of magnitude larger than traditional
files.  Uncompressed, ten minutes of CD quality audio can require over
100 megabytes of storage.  That same ten minutes of true color, 30 FPS
uncompressed video running in a 320 X 240 window might require over 3
gigabytes of storage.  Although several standards exist for compressing
these files, even compressed the files can be quite large.  Ten minutes
of audio and video compressed and stored in the common  Audio Video
Interleaved (AVI) format used in Windows can still require some 90
megabytes of storage.
<P>
The size of these files presents a variety of challenges to stand-alone
multimedia systems, such as maximizing use of limited storage space and
providing adequate speed to move the data from disk to memory.  Adding
a network to the equation creates two more challenges.  One of these is
the issue of storing and managing all of these large files for multiple
users.  This issue is currently addressed by specialized video servers
or software from companies such as IBM, Starlight, ProtoComm and
Novell.  The second issue, and the one which we will discuss in this
paper, is the delivery of these large amounts of data across the
network.
<P>
Multimedia traffic's isochronous or time-sensitive nature is another
factor which distinguishes it from traditional network traffic.  In a
traditional networking environment, data flow is "bursty".  This means
that there are frequently long delays between transmissions on the
network.  For example, when a word processor is being used, there is
typically network traffic generated when the program loads,  when a
file is saved or retrieved, and when other parts of the program (such
as a spelling checker) are loaded.  Slight delays during each of these
steps are normal and generally accepted.  If the network is busy, and
it takes an extra fraction of a second to load a data file, most users
will not notice.  However, audio and video (AV) traffic have different
requirements.  First, AV traffic is generally stream oriented rather
than bursty.  Instead of just loading a file across the network (with a
brief wait), and then working with the file locally, audio and video
often require a constant flow of information across the network.  For
example, if we wanted to view the 10 minutes of video mentioned before,
we generally cannot load all 90 megabytes across the network into the
local machine and then view it.  Instead we must view the data as it
flows across the network.  This is the second difference in multimedia
traffic, its isochronous nature.  As mentioned before, slight delays in
data transmission are common and generally unnoticed in traditional
network traffic.  Indeed, most networks are optimized for this kind of
traffic.  However human senses very quickly notice these delays in
multimedia traffic.  Delays in video transmissions result in jerky
motion, and delays in audio transmissions can quickly render sounds
unrecognizable.  Therefore it is important that multimedia data be
delivered to workstations "on time".


<H3>Limitations of Existing Networks</H3>

Using traditional networks such as Ethernet and Token Ring to
distribute multimedia to client computers has revealed some limitations
associated with those networks.  These limitations generally fall into
two main areas; a lack of bandwidth or capacity to move the large
amounts of data associated with multimedia, and an inability to
effectively handle isochronous traffic.


<H3>Bandwidth</H3>

As mentioned previously, sending digital audio and video across a
network entails moving very large amounts of data from a server to the
client computer.  Shared media networks such as Ethernet and Token-Ring
have limited capacity which must be shared among all of the machines
which are using them.
<P>
For example, an Ethernet network has a theoretical data rate of 10
megabits per second (in reality, overhead and other factors reduce this
by a significant amount).  A typical CD-ROM drive which meets the MPC
(Multimedia Personal Computer) standard is required to be able to send
data at 150 kilobytes (or approximately 1.2 megabits) per second.  At
first glance, it would appear that an Ethernet network should be able
to handle about 8 multimedia connections (10Mbps / 1.2Mbps).  In
reality however, Ethernet was not designed to handle the continuous
streams of data that audio and video require.  Token-Ring networks have
similar limitations. These "contention based" networks were designed to
handle multiple machines which generated bursty traffic and were
tolerant of delays.  While one computer is sending data across the
network, any others that want to send information must wait and then
attempt to get control of the network when it becomes available.  As
more computers try to use the network, not only is there more
information to be transmitted, but the efficiency of the network
simultaneously drops.  The result of this is that unmodified shared
Ethernet is generally effective for a maximum of only four simultaneous
multimedia connections.  According to IBM, Token-Ring's contention
scheme and higher bandwidth can support up to ten connections.
<P>
FDDI networks, which are based on high speed fiber optic cable,
overcome this problem to some extent by providing higher bandwidth. 
The FDDI specification provides a maximum throughput of 100 megabits
per second (10 times faster than standard Ethernet, and some 6 times
faster than 16Mbps Token-Ring).  In practice however, FDDI suffers from
the same problems as Ethernet and Token-Ring.  As more users are added,
each trying to send large continuous streams of data, the efficiency of
the network drops far below its theoretical maximum.


<H3>Isochronous Traffic</H3>

A second, related problem with traditional networks is that due to
their original design goals, they have no way of insuring a constant
even flow of data to the client computers. Traditional Ethernet (and
Token Ring) are packet-switched networks.  This means that when a
station wants to send information to another station, it puts variably
sized packets of data out on the network, and the network eventually
passes the packets to their destination.  This is analogous to the way
the postal service handles mail.  There is no direct connection between
the sender and the receiver.  The main problems that packet-switched
systems present for multimedia delivery are that there is no way to
guarantee the amount of time it takes a packet to get to its
destination (latency), and there is no guarantee of specific packet
sizes.  While these limitations cause little difficulty for traditional
data, they lead to problems such as jitter (jumpy video or audio) for
multimedia.
<P>
These problems are further complicated by the fact that as more and
more computers are added to the network, traditional networks behave
"democratically".  They reduce the speed of all users' data equally. 
Unfortunately, while traditional data flows can handle this (i.e. a
slightly longer delay when opening a word processing document), audio
and video signals cannot be slowed down significantly without
meaningful (often unacceptable) degradation in the quality and
therefore usefulness of the sounds or pictures they are carrying. 
While using a faster network such as FDDI or the new CDDI (100Mbps over
copper wire) can provide a larger margin for error, they contain no
provisions for insuring a steady flow of data such as is required by
multimedia.


<H3>New Network Topologies</H3>

There are several new network technologies in various stages of
development which promise to facilitate multimedia networking.  These
include variations on existing network types, such as switched Ethernet
and Token-Ring, extensions of existing network types, such as "fast"
Ethernet, FDDI-II, and Isochronous Ethernet, and new networks, such as
ATM.


<H4>Switched Ethernet / Token-Ring</H4>

In a traditional Ethernet network such as 10BaseT, each computer has a
network card which connects to a central hub.  The 10BaseT hub is
basically a repeater which takes any signal coming in on one port, and
rebroadcasts it on all ports.  Thus, in keeping with Ethernet's basic
bus structure, every machine "hears" every other machine.  Similarly,
every machine on a Token Ring network handles data for other machines.
<P>
Switched Ethernet and Token-Ring use standard cabling and network
interface cards (NICs), but replace the central repeater with a central
switch which sends data arriving on one port only to its destination
port.  This switch in effect gives each machine a dedicated (unshared)
10Mbps (Ethernet) or 16Mbps (Token-Ring) channel to the switch.  So,
while shared Ethernet or Token-Ring are poorly suited to multimedia
traffic, a dedicated channel of either type can be much more effective.
This dedicated channel, while still not specifically designed to handle
isochronous traffic, can provide enough unshared bandwidth to overcome
these problems. On most switched systems, a single port can support a
small cluster of PC's (i.e. the four machine limit on Ethernet
discussed earlier).  
<P>
Because a single Ethernet or Token-Ring card in the server would
present a bottleneck which would negate the benefits of a switched
system, the server must either have multiple NICs so that each client
machine (or cluster) can have its own connection to the server, or have
a much faster link such as FDDI. 
<P>
Switched Ethernet and Token-Ring's primary advantages are their
preservation of much of the existing network investment (i.e. existing
10BaseT interface cards and wiring can still be used), and their
relative familiarity.  Apart from the switching hub itself, there are
no new elements to learn.
<P>
There are two primary disadvantages currently associated with switching
systems.  The first is their relatively high cost per port.  Typical
systems currently retail for $800 to $1500 per port for switched
Ethernet.  The second problem is that the basic design of these systems
(i.e. multiple unshared links) does not lend itself to use in anything
other than a Local Area Network.  Interconnection to WAN's is certainly
possible, but other systems on the network gain no performance
enhancements.
<P>
Switched Ethernet is currently available from a number of
manufacturers.  Appendix B lists some of the major manufacturers and
their switching products. Switched Token-Ring is in the works from
several manufacturers, but has not been released as of the publication
of this paper.


<H4>Fast Ethernet</H4>

A second technology which may offer advances in multimedia networking
is a developing standard called Fast Ethernet.  The theory is that Fast
Ethernet will ultimately provide FDDI-like performance (100Mbps) at a
much lower cost. According to the proposals, Fast Ethernet is very
similar to 10BaseT Ethernet in its physical layout.  Although upgrading
to Fast Ethernet will require replacing network cards and hubs, it is
hoped that existing wiring can be used.  
<P>
One of the main obstacles to the rapid introduction of a Fast Ethernet
standard is the debate over how it should work.  While most proponents
have agreed on certain features (100Mbps speed, 100 meter segment
length, support for twisted pair wiring, support for 802.3 frame
format, etc.), they are divided on how logical access to the media
should be controlled.  One group believes that Fast Ethernet should use
the same control method (CSMA/CD) that 10Mbps Ethernet uses.  This
would in effect be identical to current 10BaseT Ethernet, but would run
at 100Mbps.  The other group, calling their Fast Ethernet 100BaseVG
(Voice Grade), proposes to use a control system called Demand Priority
Access (DPA).  DPA would allow for "normal priority" and "high
priority" traffic to coexist on the network.  Traditional data would
generally be classified as normal priority, while audio and video would
be high priority.  DPA would require more fundamental changes to the
Ethernet standard (leading many to say it is not really Ethernet at
all), but might be better suited to multimedia needs.  The IEEE 802.3
committee has decided to sanction the pursuit of both standards
<P>
Current supporters of true 802.3 based 100Mbps Fast Ethernet include
Cabletron Systems, Chipcom, David Systems, Grand Junction Networks, IMC
Networks, Intel Corp., LAN Media, Micro Linear, National Semiconductor,
NCR, Networth, Racal-Datacom, SMC, Sun Microsystems, Synoptics, and
3Com.
<P>
100BaseVG is supported primarily by AT&T Microelectronics, Banyan
Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, Novell, Ungerman-Bass, and
Wellfleet.
<P>
Several manufacturers have announced 100Mbps "Fast Ethernet" products
already, but since the standards have not yet been finalized, these
should be considered proprietary networks.  See Appendix C for a list
of manufacturers and their products.


<H4>isoENET</H4> 

Another attempt to add multimedia capability to Ethernet comes in the
form of a new transport called Isochronous Ethernet, or isoENET. 
IsoENET, developed by National Semiconductor and IBM represents an
attempt to combine IEEE 802.9 Isochronous LAN standards with regular
802.3 10BaseT Ethernet.  IsoENET adds a 6.144Mbps synchronous channel
to the 10Mbps channel already supported by Ethernet.  This 6.144Mbps
channel can be divided into multiple 64Kbps segments for allocation to
different isochronous communication tasks.
<P>
IsoENET's additional 6.144Mbps capacity takes the form of a
circuit-switched network. A circuit-switched network in effect
establishes a guaranteed connection between specified stations (as
opposed to the packet-switched networks described previously).  The
telephone system is a good example of a circuit-switched network.  Once
a connection is established, you are guaranteed enough capacity for
your conversation, and there are no system-introduced delays.  Circuit
switched computer networks similarly are able to guarantee latency with
a fixed packet size.  
<P>
IsoENET will use existing 10BaseT compatible wiring and will be
compatible with some hubs.  Using IsoENET will require replacement of
the interface cards in the PCs on the network, and replacement of the
10BaseT modules in the network hubs.  IsoENET is designed to be
backward compatible with 10BaseT, and forward compatible with FDDI-II
(described below).
<P>
Apple Computers, AT&T Bell Laboratories, and others are sponsoring
IsoENET's submission to the IEEE for standardization, but it will be
some time before products based on IsoENET are readily available. 
Current estimates call for IsoENET based products to be available in
first quarter 1994, at about twice the cost of existing 10BaseT
components.  


<H4>Fiber Distributed Data Interface II (FDDI-II)</H4>

FDDI-II (ANSI X3T9.5) is a proposed superset of the FDDI specification
which incorporates mechanisms to support isochronous traffic.  The
addition of this support suggests that FDDI-II will be better suited to
multimedia delivery than standard FDDI.
<P>
FDDI-II adds circuit-switching technology to FDDI  in much the same way
isoENET adds to Ethernet.  FDDI-II divides its 100Mbps bandwidth into
16 6.144Mbps circuit-switched channels for isochronous traffic.  These
channels can be further subdivided for lower speed requirements.  Any
unallocated bandwidth may be used by traditional asynchronous data. 
FDDI-II basically guarantees a specific amount of capacity to a given
machine at a specific time interval.  This guarantee, along with the
relatively high capacity of the fiber-based network, should enable
FDDI-II to deliver relatively large numbers of simultaneous multimedia
sessions.
<P>
While FDDI-II seems well suited to multimedia networking, there are
several obstacles to its rapid introduction. First, it is estimated
that it will be one to two years before the FDDI-II specification is
finalized and in production.  Second, FDDI-II is not compatible with
standard FDDI.  This means that existing FDDI networks must be
completely switched to FDDI-II in order to utilize it.  Finally, like
FDDI, FDDI-II components (network interface cards, hubs, and fiber) are
significantly more expensive than copper based networks.
<P>
While FDDI-II is not available yet, a company called Alfa, Inc. (110
Breeds Hill Rd., Hyannis, MA 02601 (508) 790-9901) has introduced a
system called FDDI-Sync which is essentially a pre-standard FDDI-II
implementation.  As with the fast Ethernet products described
previously, this should be considered a proprietary standard. 


<H4>Priority Enhanced Token Ring</H4>

IBM is working with an enhancement to Token Ring which has proven
effective at handling multimedia traffic in early tests.  IBM's newest
Token Ring card, the LANStreamer, supplements standard Token Ring with
two significant enhancements.  The first is a method of transferring
data directly from the network to the computer's memory, or from the
computer's memory to the network.  Traditionally data has been
transferred from the computer's memory to memory on the Token Ring
card, and then from the card's memory onto the network (or vice versa).
This change significantly enhances the performance of the Token Ring
network for all types of data.
<P>
The LANStreamer card also implements a priority queuing function which
allows multiple streams of data to pass through the card
simultaneously, and allows specified streams (i.e. multimedia) to get
more attention and faster processing than other, traditional
data-oriented streams.  Planned software from IBM will also coordinate
servers' use of the network with the priority queuing process, further
enhancing multimedia delivery.


<H4>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</H4>

One of the most promising new technologies is Asynchronous Transfer
Mode (ATM).  ATM will ultimately support a wide range of speeds,
transparent integration with Wide Area Networks, and built-in support
for isochronous multimedia traffic.  The protocols comprising ATM are
suitable for voice, traditional data, image, and video distribution. 
It promises to unite traditional data networks, telephone networks, and
multimedia-oriented networks.
<P>
ATM technology evolved out of the telephone industry's search for
better digital phone systems.  It was designed to satisfy voice
traffic's requirements for extremely low delay.  The data processing
industry, working in conjunction with the telephone industry, has
worked toward adding basic data networking capability, as well as the
very high throughput capability needed for such things as full-motion
video to ATM's basic design.
<P>
The result of this interaction is a system which divides network
traffic, regardless of type, into small (53 byte) cells which can be
switched (transferred) from one machine to another through the network
with very little delay or jitter.  Further, since the ATM protocols are
independent of the speed of the physical media they run on, upgrades to
faster media are possible as they become available.
<P>
ATM provides for varying classes of service depending on the priority
and/or importance of the data being transmitted.  For example, it is
very important that all data being sent in a traditional data network
arrive at its destination.  If part of a spreadsheet or word processing
document does not arrive significant problems ensue.  On the other
hand, some types of data (such as video) can be much more tolerant of
such losses.  If a small amount of data in a video stream is dropped in
transit, its absence may be undetectable, and therefore unimportant. 
ATM takes advantage of these differences by assigning one of four
priority classes to each data stream depending on the streams
individual requirements.
<P>
When an application needs to communicate across the network, it makes a
request to the ATM hub, in which it specifies the class of service, and
the amount of bandwidth it needs.  If the network has sufficient
capacity to handle the request, it guarantees the requesting
application or machine the level of service it needs.  If the hub
cannot guarantee the service requested, the application can either wait
and ask again at a later time, or adjust its requirements and request a
smaller amount of bandwidth.  The net effect of all of this is that
once a connection is established, an application which needs to
communicate across the network knows that it can transmit its message
at a given level of service.  This contrasts with traditional networks
such as Ethernet where each packet transmitted may behave differently
depending on the network's load at the time of transmission (or
attempted transmission).
<P>
ATM systems are currently under development at speeds varying from
25Mbps through Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) speeds of up to 2.5
Gbps.  Initial implementations promise to be at 25 and 155Mbps and to
move quickly to 622Mbps.
<P>
While ATM currently looks to be the best long term solution for
multimedia networking (among other things), it is also among the least
mature of the new technologies discussed.  While a number of
manufacturers have announced ATM products (see Appendix D), the initial
targets of most of these systems are network backbones.  It is likely
to be some time before ATM to the desktop is a truly viable and
wide-spread option.  While some of the most important ATM standards
have just been finalized, a number of additional standards and features
are still under development.  ATM's potential, and the tremendous
amount of interest it has generated suggest that ATM developments may
proceed at a rapid pace.


<H3>Conclusions and Recommendations</H3>
	
As is evident from the preceding discussion, networking technologies
are in something of a transitional period.  At the time this paper was
published, changes to these technologies, and the companies developing
them were occurring weekly.  There is no one "correct" answer to the
questions posed by networked multimedia.  There are however a number of
general guidelines whose consideration will help to maximize the
potential for success.
<P>
For limited multimedia requirements, traditional networks such as
Ethernet and Token-Ring can be acceptable solutions.  As was mentioned
previously, a single Ethernet network can handle about 4 multimedia
sessions simultaneously.  Token-Ring (16mb) should be able to handle up
to about 10 sessions on a single ring.  (Keep in mind that for either
network type, significant traditional traffic will reduce the number of
possible multimedia sessions.)  For slightly larger numbers of
workstations, several small networks (Ethernet or Token-Ring), each
with their own interface in the server, can provide acceptable
performance.
<P>
If a significant investment in a 10BaseT Ethernet or Token-Ring network
already exists, a switching hub can provide multimedia capability while
preserving that investment.  Switching hubs are currently available for
Ethernet, and will soon be available for Token-Ring.
<P>
In new network installations, perhaps the most important decision that
can be made is the selection of the appropriate wiring.  Changing
network adapters and hubs can be expensive, but in a large network
changing the wiring is generally more expensive.  Ultimately it appears
that running fiber-optic cable to each desktop will provide the best
network capacity.  However the current cost of fiber installation and
of the equipment to utilize fiber (i.e. FDDI) limits its availability
to most users.  Assuming that fiber is not a possibility, it appears
that the best current choice for maximizing the usefulness and life
expectancy of wiring is star-wired category 5 unshielded twisted pair
cable.  In a star-wired network, cable runs from each computer location
(usually by way of a telephone-type jack in the wall) to a central
site.  Category 5 (sometimes called level 5) is a standard which
specifies minimum electrical and physical requirements for twisted pair
wire.  Most proposed high-speed network implementations are geared
toward category 5 cable, and commonly used technologies such as
Token-Ring and Ethernet can run over it too.  Generally accepted
procedure is to run 4 pairs of this cable to each location where a
computer might ever be.  (That means 4 pairs per computer that might be
installed.)  Note that it is imperative when installing a category 5
twisted pair network that all connectors and terminators are also
category 5 rated.  A wiring company experienced in network cabling
should be familiar with the end-to-end requirements of a category 5
cabling installation.


<H3>Appendix A. Sample Network Configurations</H3>

<H4>10BaseT Network</H4>
The first two examples shown below illustrate small traditional network
topologies which are effective for many types of multimedia.  The first
example shows a traditional 10BaseT Ethernet network comprising a
server and four workstations.  As mentioned previously, standard
Ethernet can support a maximum of four simultaneous multimedia
sessions.  Note that thick or thin Ethernet would function similarly.

<IMG SRC="tek5fig1.gif">

<P>
<H4>Token Ring Network</H4>
The next example shows a traditional Token-Ring Network (16Mbps) with a
server and 10 workstations.  IBM's testing indicates that 10 is the
maximum practical number of simultaneous multimedia sessions over a
standard 16Mbps Token-Ring network.

<IMG SRC="tek5fig2.gif">

<P>
<H4>Multiple Ethernet Networks</H4>
Traditional networks can support larger numbers of multimedia sessions
as long as they are divided into appropriate segments.  For example,
the following figure shows an Ethernet network (actually 3 networks)
configured to support 12 multimedia sessions.  As was mentioned
previously, the use of multiple independent segments and multiple
interfaces in the server can overcome many of the limitations inherent
in traditional networks.  The limiting factor in this type of network
is the number of interfaces and workstations that the server and its
software are capable of supporting.

<IMG SRC="tek5fig3.gif">

<P>
<H4>Multiple Token-Ring Networks</H4>
The last example of a traditional network shows a 16Mbps Token-Ring
configuration capable of supporting up to 20 simultaneous multimedia
sessions.  Again, this configuration can be expanded by adding
additional rings and interfaces up to the maximum capacity of the
server and its software.

<IMG SRC="tek5fig4.gif">

<P>
<H4>Switched Ethernet Network</H4>
The next example shows a switched Ethernet network.  It shows a network
capable of supporting some 96 simultaneous sessions.  Its layout
differs from 10BaseT Ethernet in that it uses multiple high-speed links
(such as FDDI) from the hub to the server, and the connections from the
hub to the workstations are not shared.

<IMG SRC="tek5fig5.gif">

<P>
Many of the newer networks have the same physical appearance as
traditional networks.  For example, Fast Ethernet has the same general
layout as 10BaseT Ethernet, the only difference being the speed of the
hub and of the network interfaces.  Similarly, FDDI looks like a
Token-Ring network, but uses optical fiber as its media, and uses
special hubs and interfaces.  An ATM network, while using different
hubs and interfaces, has the same physical layout as 10BaseT Ethernet.

<A NAME="3"></A><STRONG>WOMEN IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MONTH</STRONG><P>

June is Women in Science and Technology Month, dedicated to recognizing
and chronicling the accomplishments and history of women in science and
technology. In celebration, the Web site for Women in Technology
International (WITI) ( <A HREF="http://www.witi.com/">http://www.witi.com/</A> ) is publishing daily
profiles of women working in the sciences and technology. June 23-30 is
WITI's "Take Your Children on the Internet (TYCOTI) Week." Activities
for children will include participating in a scavenger hunt on the Web,
learning how to build their own homepages that will appear on the WITI
site, taking an online tour of the White House Internet Service,
learning how to send email to elected officials, and submitting
materials for an electronic time capsule.
<P>
Coinciding with the celebration is the launch of the Women of NASA Web
site, designed to encourage more young women to pursue science- and
math-based fields. Students can chat with women working at the NASA
Ames Research Center. Link to Women of NASA at

Intranets are a hot technology in the corporate sector, but they're not
just for businesses. In academe they can save paper by linking to
electronic copies of departmental handbooks, annual reports, and other
lengthy publications; help with collaborative projects; and act as a
bulletin board for an academic community. Here at the IAT our intranet
provides links to internal information such as our workshop calendars,
employee and visitor policies, monthly reports, library catalogs, and
publications. Our external resources include links to our campus
directory, state job listings, online news sources, area recreational
information, and conference listings. Find out what intranets are with
our new Information Resource Guide, "Intranets: Readings and
Resources," at <A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/guides/irg-34.html">http://www.iat.unc.edu/guides/irg-34.html</A>. Most of the
cited articles have links to electronic copies for easy access.

<A NAME="2"></A><STRONG>FAIR USE PAMPHLET</STRONG><P>

Much of the movement to reform U.S. copyright law to take into account
new technologies centers on the rights of publishers and other
copyright holders. In this rush to protect revenues, who speaks for the
educational sector and its needs for access to copyrighted works? One
group that does is CETUS, the Consortium for Educational Technology in
University Systems, a partnership of the State University System of New
York, the California State University System, and the City University
of New York. In their pamphlet, <EM>Fair Use of Copyrighted Works</EM>, they
state that "copyright is at a critical juncture, and universities have
an extraordinary opportunity to influence the development of the law
and related practices as they affect higher education. If universities
fail to provide initiative on copyright issues, other parties will
exert their influence to shape the law for purposes which do not
necessarily advance teaching, learning, and scholarship."
<P>
 The electronic version of the pamphlet is available on the Web at
<A HREF="http://www.cetus.org/fairindex.html">http://www.cetus.org/fairindex.html</A> and contains links to fair use
guidelines and other resources that are intended to promote a fuller
understanding and appreciation of copyright laws. A print copy is
available by contacting Bonnie Dunn, CSU Chancellor's Office, P. O. Box
3842, Seal Beach, CA 90740 USA.

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>ENDANGERED LANGUAGES PROJECTS</STRONG><P>

A recent Associated Press article states that "scholars believe 90
percent of human languages may disappear by the mid-21st century,
pushed to oblivion's edge by the spread of English and other languages
via media, trade and migration." The prevalence of English as the
lingua franca of much of the World Wide Web may also be contributing to
this trend. UNESCO's Endangered Languages Project supports efforts to
document dying languages which are then recorded in the UNESCO <EM>Red Book
On Endangered Languages</EM>. The University of Tokyo's Department of Asian
and Pacific Linguistics in the Institute of Cross-Cultural Studies is
cooperating with these efforts by maintaining the International
Clearing House for Endangered Languages. For links to both the Clearing
House and the UNESCO <EM>Red Book</EM>, connect to

The digital library was the subject of two lectures this month sponsored by the School of Information and Library Science (SILS) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
<P>
Edward A. Fox, Professor of Computer Science and Associate Director for Research at the Computing Center at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI&SU) presented the SILS 1996 Henderson Lecture, "Rethinking Libraries in the Information Age: Lessons Learned with Five Digital Library Projects." According to Fox, rather than being on the way to obsolescence, libraries can play an enormous part in education in the future. He describes several projects to make his point, including TULIP (The University LIcensing Program), a testing system for networked delivery and use of journals; the ETD (Electronic Theses and Dissertations) project; the IBM Digital Library, a combination of software and hardware designed to capture assorted media in digital form and distribute multimedia content across public and private networks; and Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV), a "wired" community in Virginia where almost 40% of Blacksburg residents are on the Internet and the local schools have T1 connections. <BR>

SILS sponsored a special lecture by W. Bruce Croft on "Digital Libraries: Technologies and People." Croft is on the faculty in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the Director of the NSF State/Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval. One of the digital library systems that Croft is working on is THOMAS, a joint

Croft's lecture focused on the "hot" topics for information retrieval researchers working on digital library projects and on what is missing from the digital library. He was quick to point out that the digital library does not mean that all books will be available electronically. Costs and technical considerations will keep the vast amounts of popular printed materials in their existing format. Croft predicts that scholars will benefit disproportionately as narrowly-focused, specialized materials are digitized. Croft's article, "What Do People Want from Information Retrieval? (The Top 10 Research Issues for Companies that Use and Sell IR Systems)," covers most of the points that he made in his lecture. <BR>

<A NAME="3"></A><STRONG>WEBBED BOOKS</STRONG><P>

Finding full-text editions of books on the Internet is nothing new. For several years there have been ongoing projects dedicated to making electronic copies of existing printed texts. The next progression in this process is simultaneous publication of both hardcopy and electronic versions of a title. The Web version of a book can offer added benefits by taking advantage of the Web's hypertext capabilities, by embedding hot links (URLs) to other Web sites that are mentioned in the text, or by including non-text enhancements (images, movies, sounds) that were never part of the hardcopy publication. Here are some examples that may be of interest:

Professor James L. Morrison remains as editor, and, based on the articles in the January/February 1996 (vol. 4, no. 1), the journal retains its high quality and usefulness under the new publisher. In "Gladly Would He Learn," Terry O'Banion, (Executive Director, League for Innovation in the Community College) proposes a model of radical change in education, "based on the assumption that educational experiences should be designed for learners rather than teachers." Professor Wallace Hannum (School of Education, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), in "The High-Tech Revolution: Who Will Reap the Benefits?" cautions that simply training displaced manufacturing and agricultural workers for high-technology careers may not solve the problems that changes in the economy are creating for the workforce.

The idea for the Internet 1996 World Exposition is based on the
tradition of world fairs and industrial expositions. Unlike these
expositions, it is held entirely on the World Wide Web and is the
"first world's fair where anybody can open a pavilion, where anybody
can participate." Several pavilions have already been set up and more
are added each month. Some of the pavilions currently available include
the Global Schoolhouse, Future of Media, World Expositions (which
provides information on expositions and world fairs of the past), and
the Brain Opera (an interactive music/image project from MIT's
MediaLab). Although anyone with a Web site can set up a pavilion that
points to an existing Web page, the organizers are hoping that
participants will design new pages especially for the exposition. The

On December 7, 1995, the Galileo Probe became the first atmospheric
probe to study a gas giant. Radio transmissions indicated that
Galileo's Jupiter atmospheric probe mission had succeeded, when it was
confirmed that the probe signal had been received by the orbiter as the
probe began parachuting into Jupiter's clouds. More details about the
project are available from NASA's National Space Science Data Center

Marguerite Fuoco, graduate student in the Department of Computer and
Information Sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, spent
seven weeks during the summer of 1995 working with a group of teachers,
media specialists, and technology coordinators from schools in the
Birmingham area. During her instructional sessions the participants
explored the Internet and provided feedback about World Wide Web sites
that are of interest to educators, as well as the best ways for
information to be organized on the Internet to make it more accessible
to educators and students. This feedback was used to design the Web
page, "Educational Interface to the World Wide Web." Sections include
Research Tools and Resources, The Teacher's Room, The Student's Room,
Internet and Computer Information, and Schools on the Internet. The Web

LabNet, a project conducted by TERC (see <A HREF="bitmay95.html">May 1995</A> <EM>IAT Infobits</EM>) and
funded by the National Science Foundation, is a telecommunications
network for K-12 science and math educators dedicated to actively
supporting and encouraging inquiry-oriented, project-based learning.
LabNet uses telecommunications to provide an electronic meeting place
in which teachers can support each other in experimenting with new
teaching strategies, reflect on their teaching experiences,
problem-solve, share resources, build collegial connections with their
peers, and take part in professional development.

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>VRML ADDS 3RD DIMENSION TO THE WEB</STRONG><P>

VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is an object-oriented language
that lets you create and design navigable 3D spaces for the Web. Web
page designers can now add dimensions, texture, and "lighting"
specifications to their Web sites by using VRML. Users can download
VRML files off the Web to their browser client, which then -- with the
appropriate VRML viewer -- handles the 3D rendering and navigation.
Some of the areas in which VRML is being used include architecture,
scientific visualization, and geography. VRML files can be relatively
small, 100 - 500K, so that fairly complex worlds can be downloaded
quickly.
<P>
The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) maintains the "VRML
Repository" (<A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/">http://www.sdsc.edu/vrml/</A> ) where you can find
comprehensive information on VRML, VRML viewers and authoring clients,
mailing lists, newsgroups, documentation, sample VRML worlds, etc.
Another source of examples is located at
<A HREF="http://webspace.sgi.com/Repository/index.html">http://webspace.sgi.com/Repository/index.html</A>. You might also drop by
the VRML page at <A HREF="http://www.vrml.org/">http://www.vrml.org/</A> or the VRML Frequently Asked

<EM>Educating Jessica's Generation: Learning, Technology, and the Future
of K-12 Education</EM> is a long range, in-depth analysis of the issues
shaping education in the 21st century. It resulted from a year-long
study by a panel of educational experts from academe, industry, and
government that was sponsored by the Jostens Learning Education Forum.
The report follows a hypothetical student, Jessica, "a child of the
information age," born in 1990, beginning school in 1995. The scenario
continues by comparing her experiences with those of her daughter born
twenty years later. The intention of the study was to "create a
catalyst to help national and local leaders, educators, parents,
taxpayers, business people, and people engaged in technology
developments, enrich their dialog about the purposes, practices and
possibilities of education to help our communities and nation toward
achieving their visions." While the report's title refers to the K-12
level, much of the information is useful to those involved in higher
education.

The role of computer technologies in the humanities is increasing, and
raises some questions among faculty. Will I be compensated for my work
in this new area? Will my research using computer technologies help or
hinder my promotion? Are these activities given the same weight as
traditional publishing in tenure evaluations?

Balloonin' USA, the world's first "interactive" hot-air balloon trek
across the United States, began September 18, 1995 and will continue
through the spring of 1996. Kevin Kuehn is the pilot and founder of the
Balloonin' USA project. To take part in the project he is taking a one
year leave of absence from his job as the Assistant Superintendent for
the Douglas School District in Box Elder, South Dakota. A partnership
of educators and TIE (Technology and Innovations in Education) staff
are developing curriculum-related ideas and activities for the project.
Kuehn will post his scientific data, photos, impressions and daily news
to the Internet. Information will include "video pictures of the areas
he visits, both from the air and the ground; descriptions of schools,
people, communities, and land forms; longitude and latitude readings of
where he is and where he is headed; visibility readings; barometric
pressure, precipitation, and wind measurements; answers to student and
teacher questions." Schools subscribing to the project will receive
curriculum materials and technical information for using the Internet
to participate in student and teacher discussion groups. For more

<A NAME="1"></A><STRONG>DOES THE MEDIUM INFLUENCE LEARNING?</STRONG><P>

Yes, no, maybe...the debate has been going on for over a decade with no definitive 
answer. In 1983, Richard Clark (Professor and Chair, Division of Educational Psychology 
and Technology, School of Education, University of Southern California at Los Angeles) 
claimed that the results of comparative research on educational media gave evidence "for 
the generalization that there are no learning benefits to be gained from employing any 
specific medium to deliver instruction." As more media are added to the educational 
technology mix, the question takes on renewed importance. Papers presented in two issues 
of <EM>Educational Technology Research and Development</EM> (Volume 
42, Numbers 2 and 3, 1994) revisit the question and attempt to reframe it in light of new 
developments. Contributors include Richard Clark, Robert B. Kozma (Director of the 
Center for Technology in Learning, SRI International), David H. Jonassen (Pennsylvania 
State University), Robert D. Tennyson (Department of Educational Psychology, 
University of Minnesota at Minneapolis), and several others.

<A NAME="7"></A><STRONG>DIGITAL DARWINISM</STRONG><P>

For some researchers merely creating artificial intelligence is not enough. They are at work 
creating programs that will populate the planet with artificial creatures. In a recent 
SOUNDPRINT broadcast on National Public Radio titled "Digital Darwinism," producers 
John Keefe and Samantha Beres explored the new world of self-evolving computer 
organisms. They also showed how some independent computer programs, or even little 
robots, can develop community behavior. "Like ants at a picnic, each program or robot 
just fends for itself: moving around, looking for food, and collecting food. But when 
enough of them get together, computer societies akin to ant colonies 'emerge' with little or 
no human intervention." For more information on these new "life forms," go to URL 
<A HREF="http://soundprint.org:80/~soundprt/more_info/digital_darwinism.html">http://soundprint.org:80/~soundprt/more_info/digital_darwinism.html</A>
<P>
The SOUNDPRINT radio series is produced by the SOUNDPRINT Media Center, Inc. 
(SMCI), a production, training and educational center based in Washington, DC. The 
primary purpose of SMCI is to provide the public with information through: the 
production and distribution of radio documentaries and other public affairs and cultural 
programs; the development and dissemination of audio, video and multimedia programs 
and ancillary print educational materials; and research, editorial and production support 
services. The Center's activities encompass the international arena, including the 
development of training workshops, producer exchanges, collaborations and co-
productions, in order to inform and educate audiences both in the U.S. and abroad. For

Creating basic World-Wide Web homepages for a Web server is an
easily-mastered skill (see "Weave Your Own Web Pages," <I>IAT Infobits</I>,
No. 21, <A HREF="bitmar95.html">March 1995</A>). But if you want to add more operations to your Web
server that allow user interactivity and reader feedback, you soon find
yourself facing the prospect of learning to write CGI (Common Gateway
Interface) scripts. A gateway script can link the server to a database
and permit users to search for information on your site. It can present
a blank form to a user and then process the information gathered from
the completed form. In short, CGI scripts allow your Web server to go
beyond simply serving up screens of information to your users.
<P>
If you are planning to program CGI scripts or just want to find out
more about them, here are some sources of information.

The Less Commonly Taught Languages project (LCTL), through the Center
for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition (CARLA) at the University
of Minnesota, collects and disseminates information on all languages
other than French, German, Spanish, and modern English. The main
objectives of the LCTL project are to bring together and then
disseminate information about teaching of less-commonly-taught
languages. The LCTL Gopher server presents an alphabetical list of less
commonly taught languages, and for each language, lists the
institutions where the language is taught in the U.S. and Canada, along
with the name, address and phone number of a contact person at that
institution.

<P>
So much of the educational technology news these days focuses on the
World-Wide Web, networked multimedia, interactive video, and other new
products. It is easy to get caught up in the excitement generated by
these new technologies and forget some of the old standbys. A recent
letter from an <EM>Infobits</EM> subscriber in Sarajevo, who wrote to say that
his only entry into the Internet is through email, points out how
valuable basic email service still is to many people in the educational
community. Several recent articles reporting on the value of email in
the education experience also confirm the continuing usefulness of this
resource.
<P>
Two articles on using email in education are in a new publication, the
<EM>International Journal of Educational Telecommunications</EM> (IJET). In the
article "Can University Faculty Affect Student Attitudes Toward
Electronic Mail?" (by Cheryl A. Wissick, et al., vol. 1, no. 1, 1995,
pp. 71-84), the researchers indicated that using email to extend class
discussions, promote group activities, and enhance faculty's
accessibility not only improved the students' attitudes towards email,
but also towards the course, the course content, and, unforeseen by the
researchers, towards the faculty using email in their courses.
<P>
Per Mehus, in "An Inter-Cultural Approach to Literature: E-Mail in the
Literature Classroom," (pp. 85-92) describes a two-year project using email to
teach literature and writing with secondary school students from Norway
and the United States. In addition to reporting on the project's
successes, Mehus outlines some of the technical aspects of using email
in a class and makes suggestions for improving similar projects in the
future.

IJET will also feature a regular column by Andy Carvin (see "EdWeb

In "Creating Communities on the Internet: Electronic Discussion Lists
in the Classroom," Robert M. Bender (<EM>Computers in Libraries</EM>, Vol. 15,
No. 5, May 1995, pp. 38-43) discusses using a listserv to foster
student communication in an interdisciplinary studies course at the
University of Missouri-Columbia. Bender concludes that the removal of
time and space constraints that email afforded "resulted in a freer
exchange of ideas and greater learning, understanding, tolerance, and
creativity."

<A NAME="2"></A><STRONG>HYPERMEDIA & INSTRUCTIONAL SOFTWARE CLEARINGHOUSE</STRONG>
<P>
The Hypermedia & Instructional Software Clearinghouse (HISC) at the
University of Missouri-Columbia College of Education was created to
establish a set of procedures for collecting, reviewing, and
distributing instructional, administrative, and utility programs for
educators, trainers, and instructional technologists. HISC's goal is
the creation of a software library where developers can have their
programs published and users can find respected and reliable programs
at minimal cost. (Most of the programs are listed at $7.00/copy.) Each
program must meet specific guidelines through an extensive review by at
least two evaluators. The focus of the clearinghouse is on a collection
of stacks created in Hypercard for the Apple Macintosh computer, but
programs for other platforms (MS-DOS and Apple II) are also solicited.

In "Studio Physics: An Interactive Learning Model for Research
Universities," [<EM>Educators' Tech Exchange</EM>, vol. 3, no. 1, Spring/Summer
1995, pp. 6-11] Wayne Roberge, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,
describes a new approach to teaching introductory physics classes that
increases the students' interactive participation without increasing
the number of faculty and teaching assistants required. Studio Physics
classes cover core material in classical mechanics, classical
electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, and wave physics. The
classes combine mini-lectures, group activities, and assignment reviews
and use microcomputers running Comprehensive Unified Physics Learning
Environment (CUPLE), a Windows-based physics instructional software.
While student response to the classes has been very favorable, the
faculty are working to assess the educational effectiveness of Studio
Physics versus traditional methods. The results of these assessments
will be available in the future.

<A NAME="3"></A><STRONG>CENTERS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION AND PROJECTS</STRONG><P>

At the 1995 Special Libraries Association conference the SLA
Environment & Resources Management Division, with moderation by a
representative of the World Wildlife Fund, hosted a panel of Central
and Eastern European librarians working in environmental information
centers. The panelists discussed and demonstrated some of the
environmental information resources that are being developed on the
Internet in their countries.
<P>
The Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe (REC)
is an independent, non-profit foundation established in 1990 by
Hungary, the United States, and the Commission of the European
Communities. REC's mission is to promote cooperation among diverse
environmental groups and interests in Central and Eastern Europe and to
act as a catalyst for developing solutions to environmental problems in
this region. Participating countries include Albania, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic,
Slovenia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
<P>
REC provides its constituents with environmental information not
readily available from other sources in the region. REC's Information
Exchange Team (comprised of a librarian and a computer database expert)
answers requests for all kinds of environmental information from
individuals and groups around the world. REC's World Wide Web site
includes information on grant and fellowship programs, directories, and
electronic publications. For more information connect to URL:

In April the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Working
Group on Scholarly Communication hosted a presentation by John
Unsworth, Director of the Institute for Advanced Technology (IATH) in
the Humanities at the University of Virginia and co-editor of the
electronic journal <EM>Postmodern Culture</EM>. Unsworth demonstrated a
MOO-based World Wide Web server that allows scholars, editors, and
reviewers to engage collaboratively in networked publishing over the
Internet.
<P>
A MOO is a type of MUD (Multi-User Dungeon or, sometimes, Multi-User
Dimension) defined by Pavel Curtis, the inventor of MOOs, as "a
network-accessible, multi-participant, user-extensible virtual reality
whose user interface is entirely textual. Participants (usually called
players) have the appearance of being situated in an
artificially-constructed place that also contains those other players
who are connected at the same time. Players can communicate easily with
each other in real time." Although originating in the computer game
environment, MUDs and MOOs also have potential for use in learning
activities. Connect to <A HREF="telnet://guest@hero.village.virginia.edu">telnet://guest@hero.village.virginia.edu</A> to
explore Unsworth's MOO. For another example in education, go to

<A NAME="2"></A><STRONG>MORE SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION -- HYPERJOURNAL</STRONG><P>

<EM>HyperJournal</EM> is a discussion list devoted exclusively to electronic
journals, especially those that publish on the World Wide Web. It is
concerned with all aspects of the production and publication of
electronic journals, particularly those managed by academics
themselves.
<P>
Currently, the list is discussing the recent debate on electronic
journals between Stevan Harnad and Steve Fuller that appeared in the
May 12, 1995 issue of the <EM>Times Higher Educational Supplement</EM> [THES].
Stevan Harnad, professor of psychology and director of the Cognitive
Sciences Centre at the University of Southampton, "argues that
academics will benefit by having specialised scholarly and scientific
research literature published on the Internet. Steve Fuller, professor
of sociology and social policy at Durham University, argues that works
will not be published as freely or cheaply as Steve Harnad suggests and
that a sharp eye needs to be kept on the changing political economy of
electronic communications."

serving as global tutors to: (1) supplement the teaching received by
the student in his/her mainstream or alternative school; (2) provide
students, their parents and guardians with low-cost access to
professional tutors from around the world who are certified teachers or
qualified instructors, either teaching or retired; (3) provide
students, whose families pass a needs test, with partial or full
bursaries for payment of evaluation and tutoring fees, and with
information about area libraries, institutions and schools offering
free access to the Internet for IT students; (4) disseminate
information concerning IT and other approaches to teaching which can
enhance student learning, motivate the student and engender student
interest in learning and, for the primary- or secondary-level IT
student, encourage the student to complete his or her high school
education; (5) establish ancillary IT volunteer adult, cross-age and
peer tutoring programs, advisory services, and community and school
liaison groups; and (6) introduce an applied research program at IT
into alternative educational uses of information technology."

During the Spring 1995 Librarians' Association at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill conference, reference librarians
presented sessions on using the Internet in the sciences and
humanities. In selecting the Internet sites for the documents, the
compilers drew upon their extensive experience in providing reference
services to a wide range of users. While the guides are not intended to
be exhaustive, they provide excellent starting points for locating
science and humanities resources on the Internet. The IAT received
permission to make the session handouts available electronically. The
guides are available both in plain text and HTML versions. The HTML
version contains links to the sites that are activated when using a Web
browser.

(Indianapolis, IN: Sams Publishing, 1995. ISBN 0-672-30667-0.
$25.00/USA, $34.95/Canada, &#163;19.50/UK). Based on our experiences here at
the IAT, the book delivers on its "in a week" promise. Lemay covers not
only basics of HTML tags, but also covers design issues that are so
often overlooked in creating Web pages. She also includes a list of
sources for HTML editors and converters as well as sources for sounds
and images that can enhance your pages.
<P>
Maricopa Center for Learning & Instruction has an online tutorial
titled "Writing HTML Documents for the World Wide Web." This tutorial
was designed to help instructors at Maricopa County Community College
District in Arizona create lessons that access information on the
Internet; however, it may be used by anyone interested in learning how
to create World Wide Web pages. The tutorial teaches you how to write a
simple lesson that presents information and graphics, and provides
hypertext links to other documents on the Internet. You can access or
download the tutorial from URL =

<P>
After you have mastered the basics and want to jazz up your pages with
colorful bullets, buttons, ruler bars, icons, and other graphic
details, check out the resources listed at

of Congress' HTML: Hypertext Mark-up Language page. Topics covered

MathSoft, creator of <EM>MathCad</EM>, has set up a "Mathbrowser" (Windows
version) on the World Wide Web to broaden its exposure and allow users
to test drive its MathCad for calculations. Mathbrowser provides a way
to communicate mathematics over the Internet.

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>BATTLE OF THE BROWSERS</STRONG><P>

World Wide Web browsers are multiplying faster than most users can keep
track of. This month, two "consumer guides" are now available to help
sort out the features, strengths, and weaknesses.
<P>
In his "On the Nets" column in the March/April 1995 issue of <EM>Online</EM>
magazine, Greg R. Notess compares five Web browsers for the MS-DOS
platform (pp. 36-38, 40). The contenders are Mosaic, Cello, Netscape,
WinWeb, and InternetWorks Lite. The programs are compared for speed;
ease of setup; and how they handle HTTP, FTP, telnet, gopher, WAIS,
email, news, and bookmarks. And the winner (for now) is . . . Netscape.
This is a fast-changing category of software, so expect to see new
contenders appearing frequently.

available on CD-ROM as the first official publication of the Council of
Europe "Cultural Routes" program. It includes software interfaces (both
MS Windows and Apple Mac platforms) for researchers, students,
libraries, and schools. The objective of the project has been to create
the definitive multimedia information resource for university, school,
and library study of the Viking world (from Newfoundland to
Constantinople) and the Viking age (nearly three centuries of European
history from AD800 to 1100).

The MayaQuest Internet Center allows K-12 students to follow a team of
cyclists led by Minnesotan Dan Buettner on an expedition into the Mayan
world of Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, and Honduras that is taking place
in the winter and spring of 1995. Students will have opportunities to
ask the team questions and direct the path of the expedition. 
Educators will also find opportunities to continue the MayaQuest
experience in their classrooms long after the completion of the live
event. The MayaQuest World Wide Web site includes the expedition
leader's daily journal entries, images from the expedition sites, a
Maya languages chart, teacher tools and guides, and a scavenger hunt
for students. Additional links provide information to resources of
interest to anthropologists, sources of supplementary books and
CD-ROMs, and other Web sites with information on pre-Columbian America.
MayaQuest is sponsored by MECC, a producer of educational software;
InforMNs (Internet for Minnesota Schools); and TIES, an Internet

Book publishers' and book sellers' catalogs are proliferating on the

visiting a neighborhood book shop, but it can fill a need for those who

available in most stores. Here is a sampling of the many book lists
available. Many vendors also allow you to place orders either by
telephone or by setting up an account that can be accessed over the

CAUSE, the association for managing and using information resources in
higher education, has published the <EM>CAUSE Institution Database 1994
Profile</EM>, a 170-page publication summarizing the results from its annual
survey of colleges and universities on information technology-related
issues. Surveys were sent in March of 1994 to 1,112 CAUSE member
campuses. The report includes 158 tables, charts, and graphs covering
nine aspects of IT management and use at the 435 institutions
responding to the survey. The profile offers composite data as well as
data for six categories of institutions, including research, doctorate
granting, comprehensive, liberal arts, two-year, and special. Included
are data on strategic planning, management and organization, new and
innovative technologies, budget and financial considerations,
networking issues, microcomputers and workstations, policy issues,
academic computing, and administrative applications.
<P>
One copy of the report was sent to each CAUSE member campus. Copies of
the report are available for US $35/CAUSE members and US
$70/non-members from CAUSE, 4840 Pearl East Circle, Suite 302E,

In conjunction with the IAT's December 1, 1994, satellite broadcast,
"Libraries: Today's Issues, Tomorrow's Challenges," we have a new
bibliography. The document contains references to articles about the
future of libraries and references to publications written by the
broadcast presenters.

<A NAME="3"></A><STRONG>EDWEB PROJECT AND EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSION LISTS</STRONG><P>
<P>
Andy Carvin (Education and Information Technology Specialist,
Corporation for Public Broadcasting) maintains the EdWeb Project, a
collection of information primarily for K-12 educators. One part of the
project is a list of 145 education-centered electronic discussion lists
and email resources. The focus of this collection of lists is "general
education, K-12 education, education technology and education reform."
Lists cover discipline-specific discussions (biology, Spanish, music,
geography, physics, math, art); country-specific discussions (U.S.,
Canada, Australia); distance education; library topics; and educating
disabled students.
<P>
The list was last updated November 14, 1994, and is available on the
CNIDR World-Wide Web site. The list's URL =

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>SCIENCE AWARENESS AND PROMOTION DISCUSSION LIST</STRONG><P>
<P>
SAIS-L is a discussion list dedicated to promoting science awareness
and motivation for teachers of K-12 students. The list has a wide
international membership among both teachers and scientists. The style
of the list is free ranging in its topics, rather than a listing of
resources on science teaching. The emphasis is on the exploration and
sharing of thoughts and ideas. Subscribers are encouraged to start
discussions on subtopics that interest them.
<P>
Topics in the November postings included: suggestions for science club
advisors, gender and math, ideas for student star-gazing activities,
and announcements of conferences and journals.

In "The Speed of Write" by Gary Stix (<EM>Scientific American</EM>, vol. 271,
no. 6, December 1994, pp. 106-111), the author points out that the
concern for the flow and flood of information on the Internet should
not obscure the fact that print publications still present enormous
problems of cost, acquisition, timeliness, and storage. Furthermore,
the very electronic networks that threaten to overload us with
information have the potential to improve the current state of
scientific communication. The author makes his point with illustrations
of current projects and publications, including an online database of
high-energy physics papers at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Stevan
Harnad's <EM>Psycoloquy</EM>, a peer-reviewed, electronic-only journal on
cognitive psychology.
<P>
<EM>Scientific American</EM> [ISSN 0036-8733] is published monthly by Scientific
American, Inc., 415 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017-1111 USA. For

Additionally, one of the researchers mentioned in Stix's article,
Andrew M. Odlyzko, predicts that "traditional scholarly journals will
disappear in the next 10 to 20 years" in his paper "Tragic Loss or Good
Riddance? The Impending Demise of Traditional Scholarly Journals." The
paper is in <EM>Surfaces</EM>, an electronic journal published by the Department
of Comparative Literature at the University of Montreal, and is

"Educators will be happy to discover the excellent new resource EDRES-L
and its companion data base EDRES-DB. Although they have only recently
burst upon the Internet education scene, they are rapidly becoming
sources of information that are hard to do without.
<P>
"The list is for posting pointers to and users' reviews of any and all
Internet education-related resources, old and new. This focuses on the
hands-on, practical aspect of what's out there. Articles on specific
topics go into EDRES-DB.
<P>
"The data base is flexibly searchable, very well designed, and very
user friendly. Rather sophisticated in syntax, EDRES-DB comes with a
set of templates that you can easily adapt to whatever items you are
looking for. (I had a good time over the weekend testing it out,
trolling its waters for useful items for my teaching needs. The data
base templates worked flawlessly for me the first time).
<P>
"EDRES-L and EDRES-DB are excellent companion resources to data bases
such as those of ERIC and ONTERIS, and lists such as KIDSPHERE, IECC,

KIDS-95 is a grassroots project with a goal to involve in global dialog
as many children as possible in the fifth through the tenth grades
(ages 10 to 15). KidLink is the name of the organization that manages
the annual KIDS projects. The KIDS-95 project runs until May 6, 1995.
After that, the KIDS-96 project begins. Since 1990, over 23,000
children from 64 countries have participated in the KIDS program.
<P>
To participate in the KidLink dialogs, a young person must first answer
some thought-provoking questions. Beyond the usual "Who am I?" type of
questions, KidLink requires that the young people address their
interests, hobbies, and concerns and what they want others to know
about them. Questions such as "How do I want the world to be better
when I grow up?" and "What can I do now to make this happen?" are
designed to instill the spirit of global discussion in KidLink
participants.
<P>
To learn about the KidLink project and to keep abreast of its
developments, you can subscribe to the KidLink E-mail service. To do
so, send an E-mail message to <A HREF="mailto:listserv@vm1.nodak.edu">listserv@vm1.nodak.edu</A>. In the body of
your message, place the request
<BR>
<SAMP>subscribe kidlink your_firstname your_lastname</SAMP>
<P>
You'll receive only announcements of KIDS program activities from the
KidLink list. However, KidLink maintains several E-mail lists for kids
to trade ideas and insights with their peers. Moreover, lists exist for
several languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian,
French, Dutch, and Japanese. If you're a teacher, coordinator, social
worker, or parent and you plan to guide a child through the Internet,
KidLink maintains mailing lists to aid you in your task.

Digging for educational resources at the NYSED<BR>
In addition to Mr. Sackman's list the New York State Education
Department (NYSED) runs a Gopher server that sorts links to Internet
sites based on class curriculum. Each Gopher menu item points toward
sites that house information designed for teachers' use.
<P>
Menus and links in the NYSED Gopher can help an educator find
references to his or her field of interest without wasting hours
searching for useful information. Some of NYSED's resource topics
include English, foreign language studies, the arts and humanities,
health, physical education, home economics, social studies, and science
and technology. 
<P>
You can easily reach the NYSED Gopher by pointing your Gopher client at
<A HREF="gopher://unix5.nysed.gov">unix5.nysed.gov</A>, port 70. Once you connect to the NYSED Gopher, check
out the <SAMP>Education News</SAMP> and <SAMP>K-12 Resources</SAMP> menu items.

"Organizational and Technological Strategies for Higher Education in
the Information Age" by David J. Ernst, Richard N. Katz, and John R.
Sack, examines five key trends  impacting higher education
administration and strategies for responding to them. The trends
include: (1) flat or decreasing funding sources, (2) public
expectations and state mandates calling for more accountability, (3)
consumer expectations demanding more sophisticated services, (4)
evolving organization structures which will change traditional
hierarchies, and (5) sophisticated knowledge workers who require
increased technical and consulting support.

The IAT Information Resource Guide, "Assistive Technology for the
Disabled Computer User," has been recently updated. The purpose of the
paper is to introduce administrators and staff of colleges and
universities to the assistive technology that helps physically disabled
students use computers; and to refer those who need more specific
information -- whether on products and prices, or on agencies that work
with and assist the disabled -- to resources in their area. Along with
specific product information, the document includes addresses of
listservers that discuss related topics and references to further
readings.

<A NAME="6"></A><STRONG>TECHNOLOGY REFUSAL</STRONG><P>

In "Technology Refusal and the Organizational Culture of Schools,"
Steven Hodas maintains that "analyses of the deployment of technology
in schools usually note its lack of impact on the day-to-day values and
practices of teachers, administrators, and students. This is generally
construed as an implementation failure, or as resulting from a
temperamental shortcoming on the part of teachers or technologists. It
is predicated on the tacit assumption that the technology itself is
value-free. This paper proposes that technology is never neutral: that
its values and practices must always either support or subvert those of
the organization into which it is placed; and that the failures of
technology to alter the look-and-feel of schools more generally results
from a mismatch between the values of school organization and those
embedded within the contested technology."

November/December 1994, pp. 86-87). Killian writes from the perspective
of the classroom teacher trying to use and incorporate online
technology in the classroom. His experiences confirm many of the

<EM>Electronic Teaching and Learning: Trends in Adapting to Hypertext, Hypermedia, and Networks in Higher Education</EM>, by Robert E. Jensen and
Petrea K. Sandlin, Trinity University. "The spotlight of this book is
on emerging technology options for educators seeking to author or
otherwise modify teaching and research materials with only a modest
starting investment." Jensen and Sandlin focused their study on
accounting faculty, surveying over 1,300 educators in colleges and
universities in the US, Canada, UK, Hong Kong, Norway, and Australia.
However, most of their information is applicable to any discipline.
Chapters in the book cover the paradigm shift in computer-aided
teaching, how to get started in authoring computer-aided materials, and
speculations in what the future holds for educators using
computer-assisted learning technologies. Several appendices provide
lists of journals and newsletters of interest to teachers and
researchers, sources of hardware and software for academic
applications, and the answers the authors received from their faculty
questionnaire.

Cognitive psychologist George Miller is compiling WordNet, an
electronic thesaurus that goes beyond the usual collections of
synonyms. According to an article in <EM>Lingua Franca</EM> [Sept./Oct. 1994, p.
16], WordNet contains not only a word's definition and its synonyms,
"but also its meronyms (components, as 'handle' is to 'cup'), holonyms
(larger whole, as 'cup' is to 'handle'), and hyponyms (subsets, as
'rose' is to 'flower'). The idea is to produce a dictionary that will
allow a user to replicate the process of normal language acquisition."
The creation of WordNet's "semantic concordance" is an ongoing process
at the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton University. The
concordance includes variations of a word's meaning according to its
context for more that 125,000 words.

are Internet novices, provides enough detail to get the beginning user
of telecomputing up-and-running on common Internet functions. Many of
the examples used to guide readers through the process of mastering the
Internet are computer sites and discussion groups of immediate use and
appeal to educators. Of particular interest to teachers interested in
using this emerging technology in their classroom is the section of
model lessons. These lessons will give educators at all grade levels
from Kindergarten through high school ideas of the ways they can
integrate Internet-accessible math, science and technology resources
into their curriculum. Activities range from communicating with other
classes and subject matter experts around the world to gathering
weather data from remote locations and comparing climate trends with
those at the students' own school.
<P>
Accompanying the Educator's Guide is a NASA videotape on using the
Internet in the classroom and a diskette of IBM or Macintosh software
and documents. An order form for <EM>The Educator's Guide to the Internet</EM>
is available by contacting the Virginia Space Grant Consortium at

Educators planning to produce and market multimedia curriculum
materials can quickly be overwhelmed by how complicated it can be to
sort out the required permissions to use intellectual property in the
multimedia environment. "Legal Issues in New Media" by Mark Radcliffe,
Esq. in <EM>Multimedia: Gateway to the Next Millennium</EM> provides a brief
walk-through for getting rights to use text, computer software,
photographs, film clips and video, news programs, recorded music, and
feature films. Radcliffe also gives examples of some of the legal
problems encountered in this new market.

"What rules will we follow when we're all hooked into the information
superhighway?" "Who will own what?" "How will schools gain access to
digitized materials?" "What will fair use be then?" Questions like
these about copyright law, fair-use guidelines, and new technologies
were topics of discussion at The Educational Fair Access and the New
Media National Conference held last June. The Agency for Instructional
Technology (AIT) cosponsored the event with the Consortium of College
and University Media Centers. The conference was convened to begin the
process of developing new fair-use guidelines in the wake of an
explosion in multimedia. <EM>What's Fair? A Report on the Proceedings of

<P>
Harris writes a column called "Mining the Internet" in the journal <EM>The Computing Teacher</EM>, and much of the material for her book comes from
this column. Although there are now a vast number of guides to the
Internet [see "Tsunami of Internet Books," <EM>IAT Infobits</EM>, no. 9, March
1994], this one highlights resources of interest to K-12 educators (and
college and university faculty involved in K-12 teacher education
programs). In addition to providing overviews to all the standard
Internet tools and pointers to useful resource sites, the author
includes a section on educational applications with projects to get
students involved in using the Internet. Project descriptions include
lists of activities, grade level of audience, disciplines covered,
purpose of the project, and names of contacts for projects that require
registration.

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>ROBO BABES AND THE GENDER GAP</STRONG><P>

In "No Girls Allowed!" [<EM>TECHNOS</EM>, vol. 3, no. 3, Fall 1994, pp. 14-19]
Melissa Koch voices the concern that girls in U.S. schools are not
attracted to computers in the same numbers as their male peers. Since
competency in computer use and other technologies is increasingly
linked to academic success, especially in math and science, this
disparity translates into fewer women entering technology professions.
According to Koch, the problem cannot be attributed to any one cause,
but is a combination of how girls are socialized, girls' learning
styles, peer pressure, and teacher encouragement. She describes some
ways that could reverse the situation and bring technology to more
girls in the classroom. The article includes information on several
technology programs set up to promote girls' participation in science,
math, and computer technology.
<P>
In "Robo Babes" [<EM>I.D.; The International Design Magazine</EM>, vol. 41, no.
3, May/June 1994, pp. 38-45] Karrie Jacobs focuses on one area of
computer technology where girls and women are turned off. She writes
that almost all popular computer and "video games are still stubbornly
entrenched in adolescence--a decidedly male adolescence. . . . It is a
culture that builds systems that demand quick, reactive thinking in a
universe of limited choices. And it is this culture that is designing
the so-called information superhighway."
<P>
Some video game companies are realizing that by concentrating on
software that doesn't appeal to girls or women they have failed to
reach half of their potential customers. So far most of their entries
into this market have been limited and embarrassing. For example,
Nintendo's "Barbie: Super Model" allows girls to apply makeup to
electronic Barbie faces, and Philips' "Girls' Club" is a slot-machine
game that displays boys' heads on the screen and lets players pick
their "dream date." Jacobs thinks that while video games are just toys,
they do teach children about computers and that the electronic
interfaces in games are being incorporated into computer interfaces in
technology used by adults. "If we don't get girls interested in
computers at an early age, and if we don't have computers that are
friendly or interesting to girls, we're just going to have guys behind
the wheel on that superhighway. . . . If we don't seriously question
the games and, more to the point, the culture that designs them, our
lives could become one endless round of Space Invaders."

SIGGRAPH is the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Special
Interest Group on Computer Graphics. SIGGRAPH 94, the 21st SIGGRAPH
International Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and
Interactive Techniques, took place last month in Orlando, Florida.
Commercial fields -- movie animation production, multimedia publishing,
and graphic art in advertising -- dominated the exhibitions;
nonetheless, there were many opportunities to see what is being done in
the field of education. The conference included SIGkids -- a special
area for children to "experience the latest interactive technologies;
video and animation production; computer graphics tools for art,
design, and music production; mathematics; and science." Several groups
from the area K-12 schools had booths set up with children assisting in
demonstrating their projects. Virtual environment demonstrations were a
large part of both the educational institution and the commercial areas
in the conference. Since SIGGRAPH has a reputation for promoting
leading edge technologies, it will interesting to see if more virtual
reality programs show up in the near future in academe.
<P>

Speaking of computer graphics, the article "Images on the Internet" by
Jennifer Cox and Mohamed Taleb [<EM>Database</EM> 17 (August 1994): 18-22,
24-26] provides a good overview of what is available for viewing and
downloading on the Internet and tools that are useful for retrieving
the images. Addressing the complicated issue of dealing with graphics
file formats, it provides a chart of some of the more popular utilities
that are used to view image files. A listing of several Internet image
collections and suggestions on hardware configurations
(MS-DOS-compatible, Macintosh, and UNIX boxes) also contribute to the
usefulness of the article.

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>FROGS ON THE INTERNET</STRONG><P>

The widespread occurrence of frogs and other amphibians is a sign of a
healthy ecosystem. Perhaps the widespread availability on the Internet
of information about frogs is a sign of a healthy "infosystem." Anyway,
here are some sites to explore if you are looking for information to
use in biology classes. Unless otherwise noted, you will need a World
Wide Web browser like Mosaic to access the information.
<P>
The Imaging and Distributed Computing Group of Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory has an interactive frog dissection kit on the Internet.
Images of the frog from various views, and in various stages of
dissection, are generated on-the-fly based on parameters set by the
user. The URL is: <A HREF="http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/dissect/info.html">http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/dissect/info.html</A>
<P>
The University of Virginia/The Curry School of Education's
Instructional Technology Program has developed another interactive frog
dissection tutorial. The tutorial combines text with 60 in-line color
images and 17 QuickTime movies illustrating dissection procedures and
internal organs. Numerous clickable image maps provide interactive
practice. The URL for this site is:
<A HREF="http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/~insttech/frog/">http://curry.edschool.virginia.edu/~insttech/frog/</A>
<P>
Sandra Loosemore at Yale University maintains The Froggy Page, a site
containing links to frog pictures, frog sounds, stories about frogs
("The Frogs" by Aristophanes, Grimm Brothers' "The Frog Prince"), words
to songs about frogs, and information about the most famous frog,
Kermit. The URL for this site is:

The Australian National Botanic Biodiversity Server includes a section
on the frogs in the Australian National Botanic Gardens. The URL is:

Finally, there is Frog-Net, an electronic forum for researchers engaged
in the study of the behavior and the underlying neural mechanisms in
amphibians. The list is moderated by Jim-Shih Liaw, Department of

<A NAME="1"></A><STRONG>THE ELECTRONIC UNIVERSITY</STRONG><P>

<EM>The Emerging Worldwide Electronic University</EM> by Parker Rossman provides
an engrossing overview of how educational institutions are using
computer and television technology for an international exchange of
courses and lectures and how economically-strapped countries can use
technology to establish their place in scientific research. Rossman
gives examples of how distance communication and education is affecting
classroom instruction, research, and library services.
<P>
He also sounds an alarm for educators:  "The stakes are high.
Humanity's very survival may depend on its ability to educate as many
as possible of the 6 billion people in the world. . . . Without better
global higher education, actively involving a much higher percentage of
the world's population, we may destroy our ecological system and with
it ourselves." Rossman gives examples of how distance communication and
education is affecting classroom instruction, research, and library
services, ushering in a new era of education that may have the ability
to play a major role in our survival.
<P>
One idea that Rossman expounds upon is the concept of the "World Brain"
-- a global, encyclopedic, interconnected, electronically-accessible
scheme for coordinating all the world's knowledge. This idea was
originally proposed by H. G. Wells long before computers and online
databases. Rossman shows how close we are to achieving this remarkable
feat of education and collaboration and what future developments in
distance learning are needed to make the World Brain a reality.

<EM>The Ethics Kit</EM> is the result of three years of work by EDUCOM's
Educational Uses of Information Technology (EUIT) program. The book is
intended to encourage discussion of the legal and philosophical issues
surrounding campus computing and electronic networks. Sample computer
ethics policy statements provide models for campuses to use in
formulating their own statements. Materials, such as overhead
transparency masters, are included to be used for seminars and classes
on the ethical uses of technology. An early edition (1992) of the IAT
bibliography on computers and copyright provides pointers to additional
readings.

Peter M. Coogan, doctoral student in American Studies at Michigan State
University, co-editor of the newsletter Comic Art Studies, and
co-founder of the Comic Arts Conference, has set up Comics Studies
Email (CSE), a service to coordinate communication about comic
scholarship. Coogan's definition of the term "comics" includes comic
books and strips, sequential art (including those works not commonly
thought of as comics), and cartoons (single-panel, magazine, and
other). CSE will also cover related fields, such as animation and
adaptations of comics materials into other media.

In his little book, <EM>Life after Television</EM>, George Gilder charts the
rise and predicts the fall of television from its exalted position in
cultural, economic and technological arenas. The age of television
would be replaced by the age of the telecomputer--computers joined to
telecommunications systems. Since the original printing of this book
was in 1990, Gilder's hypothesis is hardly astonishing to today's
reader. However, the book does provide some history on the changes in
the U.S. telephone and computer industries that brought telecomputing
to its current state. He also shows how close some industries came to
adopting dead-end technology that would have delayed the progress that
we have come to take for granted as we travel the Internet.

<A NAME="1"></A><STRONG>IMAGE INFORMATION RESOURCE FOR HISTORIANS</STRONG><P>

INFORMA is a forum for users of IBM technology in libraries. This
year's INFORMA Conference, titled "Images as Information
Resources--Moving Ahead of the Curve," explored the opportunities and
problems of integrating image information into electronic library
collections and services. While the Internet is a great resource for
bibliographical and textual information collections, there are few
image collections currently available. Based on what I saw at the 1994
INFORMA Conference, we should expect, in the next couple of years, more
projects combining image information storage with online delivery.
<P>
One of the projects presented at the conference was "FDR: Day by Day,"
a joint undertaking between the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Marist
College, and IBM. The project will present a chronology of FDR's
presidency and deliver, via telecommunications technology, texts of
speeches (including images of original drafts with FDR's handwritten
changes), newspaper accounts, handwritten letters received by FDR,
newsreel footage of FDR's speeches, and other documentary film from the
World War II era.
<P>
The project will be a model for how other presidential libraries may
someday make their research materials available to students, teachers,
and researchers. March 1995 is the target date for getting the first
stage of the chronology on the Internet. Nearly 1000 scholars have been
invited to submit additions, annotations, or challenges to entries. An
email address has been set up for historians who are interested in this
project. If you would like to be included, send email to:

efforts of Peter Batke at Johns Hopkins University, it is now possible
to do a full-text search of the entire SCHOLAR database, which contains
a large variety of information relating to natural language processing,
such as: book and journal abstracts; notes on hardware, software and

Technology Planning in Community Colleges</EM>, by Jan A. Baltzer, Director
of Computing and Communications for the Maricopa Community Colleges in
Phoenix, Arizona. The paper provides information technology leaders on
campus a blueprint for creating a unique and workable  strategic plan
for information technology in support of their institution's mission.
Baltzer incorporated into this publication input from a task force of
individuals from 11 community colleges in the U.S. and Canada.
Collaboration took place through an Internet "electronic roundtable"
set up and supported by the CAUSE office, and facilitated through a
"mediated idea discussion and summary" technique. The report includes a
bibliography and sample information technology mission statements from
the surveyed colleges.

David Bedell, University of Bridgeport (email:
<A HREF="mailto:bedell@cse.bridgeport.edu">bedell@cse.bridgeport.edu</A>), has compiled a list of electronic lists for
language learning. Some of the lists "focus on issues of language
learning, others focus on language points, and others just use a
language as a medium for discussion of culture or current affairs."
These lists can be used by language teachers and students for
supplementary reading material, and they could also be used as a way to
locate native speakers.
<P>
Bedell's list of lists covers 11 areas: (1) lists concerned with
language, language learning, and cross-cultural communication
(primarily written in English); (2) lists for teaching and learning
English; (3) other Germanic languages; (4) Romance languages and Latin
America; (5) Slavic and Eastern European languages; (6) other European
languages; (7) languages of the Middle East and Africa; (8) languages
of South Asia; (9) languages of Northeast Asia; (10) languages of
Southeast Asia and Pacific; and (11) other languages (includes
endangered languages, languages of aboriginal peoples, sign language,
Esperanto, and artificial languages).

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>DON'T CONFUSE ME WITH THE FAX</STRONG><P>

With all these email addresses proliferating, it's easy to forget that
for a huge number of people, electronic communication means fax
communication. According to an article in <EM>ComputerWorld</EM>, "Fax is bigger
than e-mail. There were 24.5 million fax machines in use worldwide in
1993. That compares with 14.25 million e-mail boxes worldwide. Each fax
machine is shared by an average of eight people." ("Fax-on Demand
Grows" by Lynda Radosevich, <EM>ComputerWorld</EM>, January 17, 1994, p. 59.)
This article was brought to my attention in an editorial titled
"Internet Snobbery" in <EM>Sarah Stambler's Marketing with Technology News</EM>
(vol. 3, issue 7, March 31, 1994) which was, not surprisingly, faxed to
me. This newsletter is only available by fax.
<P>
In sharp contrast to Stambler's enthusiasm for fax communication is
Nicholas Negroponte's statement in the <A HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/wired/2.04/departments/negroponte.html">April 1994</A> issue of <EM>Wired</EM> (p.
134):  "I truly believe that the fax machine has been a serious blemish
on the computer landscape, the ramifications of which we will feel all
too soon." Negroponte figures that there are about 40 million email
users, and the number is growing by more than 10 percent per month. "By
the turn of the century almost everyone will be using e-mail, not fax."
<P>
Negroponte's argument is that while fax is a blessing for the telephone
industry (and publishers like Stambler), for the rest of us it is no
more helpful than microfilm. He contends that imaging systems, such as
fax machines, create digital data that is not structured, and
therefore, not computer-readable and capable of computer manipulation.
"E-mail is data that can be filtered, sorted, retrieved, and edited.
Its form makes it meaningful to computers, as well as people."
Following his line of thinking, information creators and providers
should be moving toward standardization of document-description
languages that serve up data in symbolic, rather than facsimile, forms.
Our archives of digitized data are growing phenomenally. Can we afford
not to deliver and store the data in as rich and versatile a format as
possible, both for today's uses and for uses we have yet to imagine?

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>TSUNAMI OF INTERNET BOOKS</STRONG><P>

New books about the Internet seem to be appearing as frequently as new
Internet sites. The IAT Library regularly purchases Internet guides,
both for evaluation purposes and to use in our workshops. Looking
through quite a few books for new Internet users has persuaded me that,
while the style may change, the substance is pretty much the same. How
many ways can you describe a sample FTP session, after all?
<P>
Currently, we include <EM>Navigating the Internet</EM> by Richard Smith and Mark
Gibbs (Indianapolis: Sams Publishing, 1993. ISBN:0-672-30362-0) in the
materials packet for our introduction to the Internet workshops. We
chose it because it includes a lot of guided exercises to give students
more practice activities after the workshop.
<P>
One of our administrative staff recommends <EM>The Internet for Dummies</EM> by
John R. Levine and Carol Baroudi (San Mateo, CA: IDG Books, 1993. ISBN:
1-56884-024-1). Its breezy style and Rich Tennant's cartoons come
across as less intimidating to non-technical users. (This book is not
to be confused with <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM> by Adam Gaffin
and Jorg Heitkotter which is available via anonymous FTP on host:
ftp.eff.org; directory: pub/Net_info/Big_Dummy; filename:
bigdummy.txt.)
<P>
I like <EM>Net Guide</EM> by Peter Rutten, Albert F. Bayers III and Kelly Maloni
(New York: Random House, 1994. ISBN: 0-679-75106-8) just for the fun of
it. As the "TV Guide of Cyberspace," this book provides pointers by
subjects to Internet sites, USENET newsgroups, and commercial resources
(Compuserve, America Online, etc.) It proves that there's something for
everyone somewhere out in the electronic world.

<A NAME="2"></A><STRONG>WHAT'S WRONG WITH MULTIMEDIA IN HIGHER EDUCATION?</STRONG><P>

The February 1994 issue of <EM>T.H.E. Journal</EM> (Technological Horizons in
Education) is devoted to multimedia. One the more provocative articles
is "What's Wrong with Multimedia in Higher Education?" (pp. 81-83) by
Dr. Martin B. Soloman, Vice Provost for Computing and Communications at
The University of South Carolina. He discusses "factors that have
inhibited widespread use of multimedia instructional courseware in U.S.
higher education as well as the factors that are necessary to allow
multimedia to thrive." Solomon writes that just as television and
microcomputers have not fundamentally revolutionized higher education,
multimedia will also fail if educators do not take into account the
time, talents, and incentives that technological innovation requires to
be successful. Other articles that address these issues focus on
faculty motivation, training, and multimedia architecture standards.

<A NAME="3"></A><STRONG>WHAT ELSE IS WRONG WITH MULTIMEDIA? --THE DARK SIDE OF INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES</STRONG><P>

Tay Vaughan, president of a CD-ROM and multimedia title production and
publishing company, explores the "multimedia swamp" in his article
"Video Violence Too Dangerous to Ignore" (<EM>Morph's Outpost on the
Digital Frontier</EM>, Feb. 1994, p. 9). Violence in U.S. society now has
the attention of politicians ("violence will become more important than
the deficit") as well as parents and educators. Violence in video games
and television is becoming a target for censorship and legal action.
Vaughan wonders if developers and marketers can be "creative enough to
overcome the dark side" of interactive multimedia and "add to the
common good as they spin new techniques and new methods." Educators may
not be able to ignore the infringement of free speech in the growing
"edutainment" arena, but they may also not be comfortable taking the
side of both "Sonic the Hedgehog" and the "Blood Dreamers."

In conjunction with the IAT's March satellite broadcast, "Creating a
Campus Network Infrastructure," two new publications are available on

Griffin, Director of the IAT Technical Support Group, discusses five
activities for networking your campus: advocate, survey, plan, install,
and operate. The document is available on the IAT Web site at URL <A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/technote/teknote4.txt">http://www.iat.unc.edu/technote/teknote4.txt</A>.

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>SCIENCE FICTION -- PREDICTING THE INFORMATION FUTURE</STRONG><P>

In "<A HREF="http://www.educom.edu/educom.review/review.94/jan.feb/01.94-SciFi">Science Fiction: Better Than Delphi Studies</A>" (<EM>EDUCOM Review</EM>,
Jan/Feb 1994, pp. 30-34), Milton T. Wolf contends that "the interchange
of ideas between science fiction and technology has generated an
extremely valuable cross-fertilization." If you want to know where the
current wave of information technology is taking us, reading science
fiction may provide more insights (and hours of entertainment) than
studying think tank reports. Wolf includes a descriptive list of
science fiction books that provide "visions of possible information
futures" to get the reader started in this genre. He also recommends
the nonfiction guide Anatomy of Wonder by Neil Barron for pointers to
more science fiction works.

<A NAME="6"></A><STRONG>TEACHING WRITING WITH TECHNOLOGY</STRONG><P>

The Winter 1993 issue of <EM>Educator's Tech Exchange</EM> covers using
technology to teach writing. Since writing crosses all disciplines and
is fundamental to students' overall education, "writing has come to be
the number one use of computers in schools across the country,"
according to one of the featured authors. Feature articles covering the
theme include: "Reinventing Writing in the Virtual Age" by Paul J.
LeBlanc, which provides both an historical view and a look at "current
hypermedia and network-based applications"; "The Audience Made Real:
Hypertext and the Teaching of Writing" by J. Yellowlees Douglas, which
recounts how a marked improvement in students' writing was observed
after the use of hypertext software in the writing classroom; and "The
Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment" by Fred Kemp, which describes
this award-winning suite of network-based programs.

NetEc is a term that unites a number of projects for networking
interaction in academic Economics. Currently, there are two projects
called BibEc and WoPEc which aim to improve the communication of new
research results in Economics. Traditionally, new research results have
been published in paper documents called "working papers" or
"discussion papers." BibEc establishes the means to announce the
publication of new papers via electronic media, and WoPEc builds a
collection of electronic working papers in postscript format, for free
retrieval by anybody with Internet access.
<P>
To receive the NetEc FAQ (Frequently-Asked Questions) file, which
contains more detailed information on the projects and on submitting
papers, write to the editor of NetEc at <A HREF="mailto:NetEc@netec.mcc.ac.uk">NetEc@netec.mcc.ac.uk</A>. State "<SAMP>NetEc</SAMP>" as the subject of the message.

<A NAME="2"></A><STRONG>THE DIGITAL LIBRARY--IS IT HERE YET?</STRONG><P>

"Report from the Kudzu Patch: Hypatia Screamed," by Jane Smith
(<EM>Internet World</EM>, Jan/Feb 1994, pp. 86-89), is a message of reason and
restraint for those of us who (to continue Smith's classical reference)
sometimes feel like Laocoon grappling with the serpents of the
Internet. Smith begins with the report of a corporate library being
eliminated and replaced with three Internet tools (WAIS, Gopher, and
WorldWide Web) and moves on to explain the folly of solely relying on
what currently comprises the "digital library." 
<P>
Although many educators are jumping aboard the Internet resources
bandwagon, she cautions that we are, for the most part, still using
experimental software to access resources that lack the organization,
authentication, and permanency that we find in traditional libraries. 
Closing the library at this time, therefore, is not advisable.
Information exploration on the Internet is an exciting supplement to
traditional resources, but "the skills of librarians and the tenets of
librarianship will be increasingly critical if we are to deliver on the
promises of the 'Information Age.'"
<P>
Jane Smith is assistant director of the Clearinghouse for Networked
Information Discovery and Retrieval (CNIDR). CNIDR, funded by NSF,
works to "promote close communication and collaboration between
software engineers and librarians during the development and deployment
of usefully managed distributed networked information services." For

"Computers and Copyrights" by Thomas J. DeLoughry (<EM>The Chronicle of
Higher Education</EM>, 11/24/93, pp. A15-16) summarizes a recent hearing
convened by the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, a
subgroup of the White House Information Infrastructure Task Force.
Electronic dissemination of information and multimedia applications are
making copyright a hot issue for users and publishers. One disturbing
development is some publishers' use of contract law to circumvent the
fair use provisions of current U.S. copyright law. Such "back door"
approaches create more complications for educators who are increasing
their reliance on electronic information channels.
<P>
<EM>The Chronicle of Higher Education</EM> [ISSN 0009-5982] is published weekly
by The Chronicle of Higher Education, Inc., 1255 Twenty-Third Street,

<A NAME="4"></A><STRONG>NEW CAUSE PROFESSIONAL PAPER EXAMINES INFORMATION JOB FAMILY ON CAMPUS</STRONG><P>
	
CAUSE Professional Paper #11 explores the idea that professionals who
manage information in higher education--whether from the computing or
library community--could be considered part of a single "job family."
<EM>Reinvesting in the Information Job Family: Context, Changes, New Jobs, and Models for Evaluation and Compensation</EM> was written by Anne
Woodsworth and Theresa Maylone of the Palmer School of Library and
Information Science at Long Island University. The paper reports
results of a study designed to determine the similarity or
dissimilarity of jobs in libraries and academic computing in selected
universities, and to test a methodology for measuring their
comparability.
<P>
The paper should be of interest not only to information technology
professionals and librarians, but also to personnel officers.

CAUSE Professional Paper #11 is available from CAUSE, 4840 Pearl East
Circle, Suite 302E, Boulder, Colorado 80301, USA; tel: 303-449-4430; or

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>DOES THIS MULTIMEDIA STUFF WORK?</STRONG><P>

In these times of budget reductions, the IAT frequently gets questions
from faculty who want solid evidence that computing technology,
especially multimedia computing, is an effective educational tool.
While much of the literature is anecdotal in nature, we are now seeing
reports based on more rigorous study. Here are some resources that we
suggest for more information:
<P>
<EM>Multimedia Computing: Case Studies from MIT Project Athena</EM> by Matthew
E. Hodges and Russell M. Sasnett. (New York: Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.,
1993. ISBN: 0-201-52029-X)<BR>
	This book presents some multimedia computing basics, using
several Project Athena applications to illustrate these concepts. It
provides a good view of how educators are actually using multimedia
technology. There is also a section covering technical considerations
for multimedia applications designers.
<P>
<EM>101 Success Stories of Information Technology in Higher Education</EM> (New
York: McGraw-Hill Primis, 1992. ISBN: 0-390-59763-5)<BR>
	While not specifically covering multimedia computing, this book
is useful for answering the question "What good software is available
for (fill in your academic discipline)?" This collection of software
descriptions resulted from a challenge raised by Joe Wyatt, chancellor
of Vanderbilt University, at the 1989 EDUCOM conference to identify 100
exemplary cases that "demonstrated the impact that information
technology holds for higher education." Each software story includes a
description of the package, the human and technological resources
required in the design process, and the benefits of using the program.
One of the most valuable items included is how to contact a real person
for more information on each project.
<P>
<EM>Assessments of Multimedia Technology in Education: Bibliography</EM><BR>
	The IAT has prepared this document that is available
electronically. It has been recently updated to cover not only higher
education, but references to studies in private industry, government,
and K-12.

Over 100 readers of <EM>EDUTECH Report: the Educational Newsletter for
Faculty and Administrators</EM>, were interviewed for their opinions on the
hot issues in higher education information technology (IT) for 1993/94;
their responses appear in the September 1993 issue (vol. 9, no. 6, pp.
1, 4-5). The chief concern of those polled was:  "resources are
dwindling as demand for services is increasing; how do we match these
opposing forces without dying in the process?" Other issues include:

<A NAME="5"></A><STRONG>NETWORKING ON THE NETWORK</STRONG><P>
by Phil Agre, Department of Communication, University of California,
San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0503 USA.
<P>
Phil Agre's paper, "Networking on the Network," draws on his 15 years
of using electronic communication in research communities. His thesis
is that a "great deal of effort is being put into technical means for
finding information resources on the net, but hardly anybody has been
helping newcomers figure out where the net fits in the larger picture
of their own careers." This is not an email manual or a guide to
listservs. It is, rather, a collection of Agre's personal observations
and friendly advice for neophytes to fundamentals of professional (not
technological) networking.

<A NAME="3"></A><STRONG>THE ALLIANCE FOR COMPUTERS AND WRITING</STRONG><P>

The goal of the Alliance for Computers and Writing is to advance the
use of computers to teach writing. This professional association will
work with the established conferences, publications, and committees in
the computers-and-writing field. Some of the Alliance's current and
planned activities include: (1) maintaining a central database for the
profession, (2) using the database to advertise activities within the
profession, (3) creation of an information clearinghouse, (4) creation
of regional Alliances, and (5) advocacy of the use of computers to
teach writing.
<P>
The Alliance will open its doors, officially, in January 1994. One of
its first efforts will be to increase the support that faculty get when
they attempt to incorporate computers in their teaching. To do this,
the Alliance will work to expand the number of training workshops
available, make available sample syllabi of training workshops,
identify local consultants willing to talk to people in their
geographic area, publish guidelines for the kind of support needed for
faculty to succeed in their efforts to use computers in their teaching,
and help support local conferences.
<P>

conference (Nov. 6, 1993 in Fairfax, VA), contact Trent Batson,

<EM>University Libraries and Scholarly Communication</EM> is a 205-page study
prepared for the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The study addresses two
main areas: the information and publishing explosion that "jeopardizes
the traditional research library mission," and the new electronic
information technologies that "make it possible to envision radically
different ways of organizing collections and services." Topics covered
include: growth of library collections and expenditures, book and
serial production and pricing, information as a commodity,
bibliographic information in electronic form, electronic publishing,
document delivery, and economic and legal issues.

The evolution of the university library in the information age is the
focus of a new report for college and university presidents published
by the Higher Education Information Resources Alliance. The
HEIRAlliance was formed in 1990 by the Association of Research
Libraries, CAUSE, and EDUCOM to bring together the information

The HEIRAlliance Executive Strategies Report #2, "What Presidents Need
to Know...about the Future of University Libraries," summarizes a
recent report published by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation on the
operations and economics of research libraries as vehicles for
scholarly communication, with special attention to the impact of new
information technologies. The report was mailed to presidents and
chancellors of all U.S. colleges and universities and primary
representatives of the institutional members of the three sponsoring

has developed an intriguing new tool for managing the cornucopia of
information linked to the Internet. The World-Wide Web (W3), a global
hypertext system, provides links between a phrase in one document and
related information elsewhere. Unlike some hypertext, however, the
links in W3 connect across the Net.... So far, pretty point-and-click

<H2>Higher Education and the NII - From Vision to Reality</H2>
<H4>by William H. Graves</H4><HR>

<H3>Track B: Networked Applications</H3>

<H4>Report</H4>

<P>Track B’s papers represent a rich and diverse mix of experiences and perspectives. A common theme nevertheless emerged from the eclectic discussion based on these papers and the plenary Track B presentation: the Global Information Infrastructure (GII - Internet) enables higher education to extend its services beyond its present reach. Higher education can be a growth industry!  

<P>Today’s Internet infrastructure already provides global access to some of higher education’s resources and thereby affords higher education the opportunity to extend its services beyond the reach of traditional academic infrastructure - and thus to become a growth industry. The social and technological fabric for such growth is fast emerging, as the following observations reveal:

<OL>
<LI>The rapid growth of the home market for PCs and Internet-connected commercial network access services is well documented. This suggests that most homes in the developed world will have intelligent access to the GII by the end of the decade.  

<LI>The World Wide Web and its cross-platform browser tools are likely to evolve into the dominant network access paradigm, even as the architecture of the Web is transformed to scale better to meet the demands of exponential success.  

<LI>The rapid growth of the standards-based intelligent infrastructure cited above will raise public expectations for the networked delivery of educational services, whether provided by today’s educational enterprise or by new, for-profit educational ventures. Web standards can be the foundation for a broad-based, commodity approach to the delivery of educational materials and programs, a possibility that has been noticed by the commercial sector.</OL>

<P>If higher education is to remain a keystone in the social and economic development of a global democratic community, it must embrace the benefits to be derived through the transformational technologies of the GII, identify the barriers to these beneficial changes, and overcome these barriers through communal action.   

<H4>Benefits</H4>

<P>Internetworking is amplifying. The resources of one networked institution or individual are amplified and enriched by those of others on the net. Anytime, anyplace asynchronous communications and anyplace synchronous communications can dramatically improve the social fabric for human communication and collaboration. This is the basis for the opportunity for higher education to become a growth "industry."  

<P>Many scholarly and research communities long ago (in network time) realized the collaborative benefits of e-mail and listservs and are now realizing the benefits of the Web as a medium for dissemination. As the Web becomes more interactive with the introduction of new development tools, such as Java, the network "collaboratory" can gain functionality and mature into a infrastructure for instruction and learning. Learning includes not only the student learning associated with instruction, but also the expert learning (research and scholarship) that is the basis for our evolving understanding of the human condition and the scientific and technological advances that fuel society’s economic engines.  

<P>Instruction is currently more dependent on time (the class schedule) and place (the classroom) than are research and public service. The time and place dependencies of the contact-hour model dampen the impact of technology overlays on today’s instructional practices, which therefore are a target of maximum opportunity for the application of the anytime, anyplace technologies of internetworking. The opportunity is to utilize the GII to mitigate the expensive infrastructure of the campus-bound classroom and the labor-intensive lecture and, in the process increase access to instruction while containing its cost. Increasing access and containing costs will be hollow benefits if the quality of students’ learning is not increased or at least maintained. The time is right to demonstrate that all three are possible in a way that scales to meet today’s public expectations and fiscal realities.

<H4>Barriers</H4>

<P>Higher education is viewed by many today as a learned society, inwardly focused by its academic self-interests and too often unresponsive to the needs of society. Yet a knowledge economy must rest on an outwardly focused academic enterprise responsive in an affordable way to the educational needs of a learning society and capable of tailoring its services to meet those needs as they evolve in times of rapid change. If higher education is to meet the needs of a learning society, it must replace its one-size-fits-all instructional and public service offerings with more flexible services that can be customized to meet individual needs and changing circumstance. From a customer perspective, academic infrastructure and practices appear to be teacher- and institution-centered. Today’s academic infrastructure must be transformed into a service and learning infrastructure as the foundation for a modular, more flexible set of educational services. Existing barriers to change, such as those noted below, must be recognized and lowered.

<P><OL>
<LI>Computers connected to the GII are not yet pervasive in colleges and universities and the communities they serve. Computers and network infrastructure, like telephones and the telephone network, must be personally accessible to all of higher education’s constituents to be useful. Success will require annualized funding for information technology, an understanding of the economics of networking infrastructure and services, and the participation of the commercial sector.  

<P><LI>Higher education must remove today’s barriers to collaboration if institutional investments in networking are to pay maximum dividends. Colleges and universities are accustomed to associating and cooperating but have little experience in planned collaboration involving shared investments with contractual responsibilities and deliverables. Geopolitical boundaries are antithetical to the effectiveness and efficiency of networking, and so collaboration generally should be planned around programmatic needs rather than geopolitical boundaries. Existing geopolitical arrangements, however, may make joint investments easier. For example, purposeful shared investments within state systems could be especially effective as state political leaders issue new calls for accountability and educational productivity.

<P><LI>Higher education has honed its instinct for inertia over the years. Now is the time to find ways to amplify for the common institutional good the individual entrepreneurial innovation that persists on campuses everywhere. Higher education must begin now to experiment with new service models, especially new instructional models that compete with the prevailing, comfortable contact-hour model by taking advantage of new asynchronous and synchronous communication technologies to extend the reach and productivity of instructors. The flexibility and leverage of the GII can be used to transform the education market into a commodity market for those wanting "education on demand." Whether a commodity market develops in education or not, institutions must awaken to the possible consequences of students being able to customize their education by assembling courses from a global market basket of suppliers.  

<P><LI>There are too few faculty and institutional development programs designed to meet the challenges and opportunities inherent in the GII and its impact on funding patterns and societal expectations. Many faculty will need help in learning to use the network and in rethinking the currently dominant lecture model to take advantage of the network and its shareable resources. A few will become developers of immersive learning materials for sharing with others, whether on a commercial or inter-institutional basis.  

<P><LI>There are no high level standards-based tools for developing interactive Web content and networked processes for managing distributed curricula and instructional programs. Such tools will be needed to create a market for distributed instruction.  </OL>

<H4>Recommendations</H4>

<P>Several recommendations for social change within the academy are implicit in the above discussion of barriers. It is the last barrier cited above, however, that directly intersects Track B’s focus on network applications and that is the basis for two recommendations that fall within the scope of action of the conference’s sponsors.  

<P>The Web currently provides access primarily to resources created in the rather static HTML format. New, more interactive networked applications will be required to create a distributed environment for: 1) guided, immersive self study; 2) managed asynchronous communication and collaboration; 3) real-time (synchronous) collaboration and application sharing among learners, instructors, and researchers; and 4) managed networked instructional and public service offerings. The Web phenomenon, however, suggests that such applications will be developed if access tools and de facto development standards are available to remove the constraints of developing on a particular configuration of hardware and operating system. This observation leads to two related recommendations.

<P><B>Recommendation 1</B> - <I>Investments by governments, foundations, and industry in networked educational applications should focus on open-system (cross-platform) application development tools in order to create a leveraged environment for developing scaleable, networked educational services.</I> Component technologies - building blocks - can encourage a "1,000 flowers to bloom." The foundations for such building blocks are now emerging from the industry in the form of object-oriented development tools and distributed object architectures - Blackbird, Common Point, DSOM, Java, OLE, OpenDoc, Visual Age, to name a few. These generic tools and "standards" will not provide all of the building blocks necessary to create a distributed environment for instruction, research, and public service, even though they likely will solve many problems - authentication, authorization, and security, for example. The new component tools and models, however, can be extended to include the required functionalities. 

<P>Creating networked content materials for learning, for example, will be much easier if generic, cross-platform building blocks and protocols are available to developers. For example, the developer of an application designed to allow students to collect and analyze data from a scientific instrument on the Internet should have access to a networked data sampling tool which recognizes various data protocols, an intelligent plotting window with a variety of display and scaling features, and a tool for passing sampled data to the plotting window. With such tools, the developer could concentrate on developing a networked learning environment incorporating interactive data collection and analysis.  

<P>More generally, the interoperable building blocks required by content developers would include 2- and 3-dimensional graphing templates, mathematical modeling templates, symbolic computation and manipulation engines, a mathematical scripting language, molecular modeling templates, intelligent periodic tables and atomic bonding tools, other science-specific generic functionalities, templates for developing case studies around video clips, tools for glossing texts, tools for synchronizing temporal data (such as music) with related text and images (such as musical scores), bilingual lexical databases and search tools for developing second-language acquisition applications, and many other generic functionalities. There is an equally compelling need for building blocks from which many different applications for managing distributed curricula can be developed.  

<P>The investments in application development building blocks envisioned in this recommendation will bear little fruit unless there is an "open-standards" mechanism in place to provide an interoperability framework and aggregated advice to developers. This is the thrust of the next recommendation.  

<P><B>Recommendation 2</B> - <I>Develop an international open forum to frame and guide the development of application building blocks otherwise not likely to be available for the development of education-specific networked services. </I>The time is right to develop a mechanism to accomplish at the applications level what the Internet Engineering Task Force has accomplished at the transport and middleware levels of the Internet. (Applications must be able to interoperate and take advantage of other resources on the network.) The forum should be organized to ensure the international participation of: 1) leading academic technology organizations, 2) systems and applications companies active in the development of the Web and the GII, 3) federal agencies and foundations with mandates synergistic with the investments envisioned in Recommendation 1. The forum should invite discipline-specific contributions to its work on an as-needed basis. This recommendation is aimed at the organizations sponsoring the conference, especially at EDUCOM. (The leadership of EDUCOM’s National Learning Infrastructure Initiative is on record as favoring the approach captured in these two recommendations.)  

<P>The two recommendations are intended to seed a global market for networked educational services.  

<P>The discussants in Track B believe that education is the engine for global socioeconomic order and progress. They offer their observations and recommendations in the belief that technology-enabled radical change is imminent and that higher education, with help from its non-profit and commercial partners, must participate in that change for the common social good - and for its own good.

<TITLE>A Higher Education Perspective on Network Applications</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>A Higher Education Perspective on Network Applications</H2>
<H4>by William H. Graves</H4>
<HR>

<P>Network applications are playing an increasingly transformational role in higher education. E-mail, listservs, and news groups are connecting far-flung scholars and students into global communities of intensely shared academic interests. The World Wide Web and its client browsers, such as Mosaic and Netscape, are democratizing publication and access to publications at a rate challenging to traditional academic quality assurance mechanisms. But to understand the broadest and deepest implications of network applications for higher education, we must train our eyes on the Web of the future to envision even more than is offered by today’s tools for connecting to remote host applications, communicating asynchronously, publishing information, and searching for information. To look ahead effectively, however, we must be fully aware of the implications for higher education of today’s rapid and often discontinuous social and economic change.

<P>In many industries, the globalization of labor and capital are combining with off-the-shelf component technologies and parts to create fierce competition and shrinking profit margins, thereby squeezing investments in research and development, infrastructure, customer support, and employee benefits. Competition, standardization, and other factors are moving such industries away from traditional one-size-fits-all mass production and toward mass customization. The computer industry is a good example. A commodity market is emerging for customized personal computers selling at a very thin profit margin. Call an 800 number you found in a trade magazine, specify the features you would like in a personal computer, and ask that your new computer be shipped overnight. To understand the analogy in higher education of such industrial mass customization, we must understand higher education’s current mass production practices.  

<P>Although institutional missions are varied and multi-faceted, higher education’s core mission is instruction, especially as it is understood by the public. Variations in class size can be used to create economies of scale or to create more intimate classrooms, but in both cases the lecture dominates the current contact-hour model of instruction. In this sense, the contact-hour model is a one-size-fits-all model mass produced on an infrastructure of classrooms, chalkboards, and rigid class schedules - a teaching infrastructure. The contact-hour model is labor-intensive and especially costly when quality is a concern, for quality is typically associated with small class sizes. Yet its true costs are difficult to grasp because so many cost centers and revenue centers are aggregated together in institutional budgeting. In disaggregating this morass to respond to rising external demands for accountability and cost containment, we should recognize the distinction between instruction aimed, on the one hand, at learning particular skills and bodies of knowledge and, on the other hand, at underpinning the residential undergraduate experience with its goals of socialization and learning to learn. Network applications can be used to mitigate costs in both cases, but the residential undergraduate experience will continue to be expensive because of its residential nature and the presupposition that students are willing to pay for comprehensive four-year courses of study bundled to certify accomplishment in a major as added value to a general education. (An attendant question in today’s socioeconomic climate is whether the residential undergraduate experience will fall from grace as a public good and become a luxury available only to the affluent.)  

<P>Not all students are interested solely, if at all, in a residential experience. Many express tightly focused, self-selected learning objectives as consumers of instruction. This is especially the case with "non-traditional" learners and "life-long" learners who may have legitimate educational needs not easily accommodated by either the time-and-place constraints of traditional campus-based study or the four-year bundling of general education and the major. Since networked applications can be designed to disintermediate support for instruction, its management, and the assessment of its outcomes, higher education has a new opportunity to customize educational opportunities to meet students’ self-selected needs. If we diffuse information technology throughout our institutions and share it wisely across institutions, we can simultaneously increase the quality of learning, increase access to instruction, and contain the costs of instruction. These three holistic goals and the new technology-enabled opportunities to mass customize instruction are at the heart of EDUCOM’s National Learning Infrastructure Initiative.  

<P>As a conduit for change, the Global Information Infrastructure (Internet) raises fundamental questions for me as a faculty member reflecting on the rising socioeconomic expectation for increased instructional productivity. How can I use the leverage of the network to optimize the impact of the time that I spend communicating with students? Will new network applications allow me to reach more students tomorrow as effectively, more flexibly, and with the same commitment of time as I do today? What ultimately will be the best use of my time with students? Where is technology taking teaching?

<P>We have known for some time that the stand-alone multimedia computer can be deployed effectively as an immersive learning environment. The award-winning <A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/demos/nouvelle.html">Nouvelles Dimensions</A> (<A HREF="http://www.iat.unc.edu/faculty/noblitt.html">J. Noblitt</A> and others for Heinle & Heinle Publishers of Boston) demonstrated at this conference provides an excellent example in the context of second language acquisition. Now we can also glimpse the emergence of a learning infrastructure in the example of a Web-accessible library of interactive (immersive) modules for learning introductory mathematical topics. This <A HREF="http://ike.engr.washington.edu/mathwright/">Mathwright Library</A> (J. White and others for the Institute for Academic Technology), also demonstrated at this conference, is available on the Web. But a network library of immersive learning modules is not the sole ingredient for successful instruction any more than is a textbook or today’s campus library. We need networked course management tools, such as those emerging from Miami-Dade Community College and its partners in <A HREF="http://www.mdcc.edu/synergy/">Project Synergy</A>.  We also need networked tools to assess learning in order to ease the labor of grading. Together with today’s asynchronous communication and publication tools, such network applications can support for-credit learning while mitigating the need for classrooms, lectures, and rigid, time-defined measures of academic success - the contact hour, the semester, and the four-year degree. Emerging building-block (component) technologies, such as Java and OpenDoc, allow us to create these kinds of network applications and, thus, to modularize both content and instructional practice. We have many opportunities to reflect on the meaning of mass customization in instruction.  

<P>A learning infrastructure, then, must support modular, distributed instruction, a concept already at work in today’s video-dominated distance education model. But we must understand the differences between computer networks and video networks if new instructional models are to scale in ways that respond to the growing demand for cost containment. The primary difference between computer (data) networking and video networking is not video itself. After all, we can capture, store, and retrieve video in digital form across computer networks - video on demand. The critical difference is that a real-time video network, as typically deployed for distance education, is time dependent with interconnections mediated by humans. The resources for a teleclass or teleconference are scarce and must be negotiated and scheduled, and the time-dependent interconnections among the participating sites must be managed by a technician. In contrast, a student at a computer connected to a computer network can have access any time to any available resource on the network, and this access is mediated by computers without additional human intervention. In short, the Internet model of inter-networking scales more readily than today’s (real-time) interactive video model, and we should remember this significant difference as we blend these two technologies into new distributed instructional environments.

<P>The changes portended by new educational network applications are changes that will require new policies and investment patterns at the institutional level and beyond if flexible, scaleable, and affordable educational practices are to emerge. Policy makers and academic leaders must understand that the computer lab, although necessary in the short term to guarantee network access to all students, is not the end game. Like the phone booth, the computer lab is only a safety net in the quest to ensure personal access to every member of the academic community. Similarly, the technology-enabled classroom is only a starting point in navigating the transition from the prevailing campus-based teaching infrastructure to a global learning infrastructure. Even the centrality of the four-year degree may be eclipsed by a more flexible portfolio concept of certification which emphasizes learning outcomes, de-emphasizes time on task, and is less friendly to dogged persistence toward degree with a grade of C. "Collabotition" - competition based on pre-competitive collaboration - will have to prevail. Colleges and universities have learned to associate but have little experience with the kind of shared-risk investments required to develop distributed instructional resources. Networks do not respect geopolitical boundaries, and so higher education will have to learn to accept transfer credits and to share the high costs of application development and delivery infrastructure for networked instructional materials and processes. If textbook publishers do not learn to utilize network technologies to shift their costs from back-loaded production, marketing, and distribution processes to front-loaded application development, then higher education itself may have to learn to invest consciously and effectively in curriculum development rather than in curriculum delivery.

<P>If we believe that the goal of instruction is learning, then these remarks, which have focused on instruction, apply equally to two other expressions of the learning theme: research and public service. Learning, whether by the student or the researcher, must be quality assured and credited. In a distributed model, this will require new tools for authoring and delivering content, managing curricula, managing intellectual property, managing interactions, sharing data (whiteboard), and visualizing data. Such tools have been available to selected researchers in limited form for some time. Now these tools can be broadly available and easy to use. Access to tools and authentic data will no longer differentiate the scholar from the student, and the theme of learning can unify the islands in the educational enterprise.  

<P>Our opportunity is to utilize network technologies to amplify the impact of higher education and to position higher education in the public mind, not as an inwardly focused learned society, but as the intellectual cornerstone of an emerging knowledge society - a learning society - in which instruction, research, and public service are growth "industries." Whether or not we seize this opportunity, commercial education providers are sure to take advantage of the growing presence in the home of networked personal computers. Higher education’s competitive advantage lies in its seminal contributions to the Internet and its embedded World Wide Web. Our collegial problem-solving approach to inter-networking led to de facto standards for the transport layer, the middleware layer, and the presentation layer (Web) of the Internet. With component technologies now emerging to enhance the utility of the Web beyond the locate-and-display capabilities of today’s Web browsers, the time is right to craft a collegial approach to creating a set of sharable application building blocks for enhancing the Web as an open framework for distributed instruction, research, and public service. This is the challenge to those conference participants interested in the future of network applications and attuned to the related papers published elsewhere in this volume.

<H2>Enhancing Instruction with Multimedia</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Educational technology, defined broadly, includes everything from blackboards and desks to books and computers. Naturally, none of this technology guarantees that learning will take place; but in the hands of skillful teachers and motivated students, its use can enhance instruction in significant ways. New technologies are incorporated into teaching methodologies when they help us do our job better. Wax tablets, blackboards and pencils with erasers can be thought of as technologies designed to make the writing medium more conducive to trial and error, more "interactive" than parchment, print or ink-pen. Underlying pedagogical objectives, it should be noted, are likely to remain quite stable in the face of change. It is not vital whether students use pen, typewriter or word processor, as long as they learn to write and write well. 
<P>Information technologies, over time, have the power to transform completely instructional methodologies. Print technology, for example, has caused the word "literate" to become synonymous with "educated." Much more than reading and writing is required of the educated person in the modern information era, however. People rely on "multimedia" presentations of sound, image and text to keep informed, and the computer has become an important tool for helping sort and organize information in its various forms. More importantly for educational purposes, computers are used to locate and process information that is relevant to individual interests and well-being. People are becoming increasingly less skeptical about the benefits of information technology, but they desire to understand more about its implications for current educational practices. We have moved from "So what?" to "Yes, but..."
<H3>Medium and Method</H3>
A detailed analysis of the impact of informational media on educational methodology is an elaborate undertaking, as witnessed by the lengthy bibliographies found in the literature on the subject (McClintock, 1993; McLuhan, 1964; Olson and Torrance, 1991; Postman, 1991). The brief overview that follows is intended to provide a focus on the use of interactive media for enhancing teaching and learning. The various educational media and the methods they support are outlined below in quasi-historical order, from lecturing to computer-aided learning. In reality, the progression is not as linear as the presentation may suggest, and there are important modifications that must be considered for the hearing or sight-impaired student. However, the basic point can be demonstrated that educational methodologies have been deeply influenced by the information technologies available. To paraphrase Marshall McLuhan, we may say, "the medium is the method."
<H4>The Oral Medium and Direct Methods </H4>
The oral medium may be viewed as a kind of educational technology. It gives rise to the classroom as the domain of instruction, as students must be within sight and hearing of the teacher. The physical presence of the instructor permits the novice to observe a role model and identify a human resource for individual educational needs. Direct methods tend to be holistic in nature, involving students with the primary material of a particular subject matter. The instructor often exemplifies the ideals of the instructional outcomes. The implied social contract is that instruction will be of value to the individual, and the instructor takes responsibility for the educational well-being of the student.
<H4>The Print Medium and Analytic Methods </H4>
The individually owned textbook and the vast information resources of the library provide an extension of the learning environment beyond the oral classroom. The print domain, as is well known, transformed educational methodologies. It has also led to additional role models for students, in particular the scholar as researcher, independent of affiliation with church or state. Teaching methods based on print technology tend to exploit reductionist techniques for analyzing a given subject matter, and the very process of writing provides support for detailed hypothetico-deductive examination. The implied value of text-based methods for the learner is the development of critical thinking, in particular the ability to resolve conflicting interpretations arising from the expanded sources of primary data.
<H4>The Information Media and Audio-Visual Methods</H4>
The modern educated person relies on information media for continuing education. Photojournalism provides images for enhanced visualization of information, expands access to information, and offers new possibilities for the democratization of knowledge. The advertising and entertainment industries have developed methods of presentation, designed to exploit the commercial possibilities of the broadened marketplace, that can not be accepted uncritically by educators. Educational audio-visual methodology requires provision for critical thinking skills, and it must be coupled with a value system that includes responsible empowerment of the student. Audio-visual methods are essentially holistic in nature. They have been employed successfully for overcoming language and literacy problems in learning and are particularly effective for distance education.
<H4>The Digital Medium and Interactive Methods</H4>
The term "digital" dramatizes how radically different the new educational medium is. Digitized multimedia objects--sounds, images and text--may be created, edited, linked together and transmitted with great ease. Instructors and students can control their presentation and analysis with little more computer expertise than keyboard or mouse skills. The methodology is interactive, and therein lies its interest for educators. It engages students actively in learning and helps instructors to introduce students to primary data in sound, symbol or image form. Instructors can function as guides to sources of knowledge, navigating a new educational domain, the information network. Interactive methods combine holistic and analytic techniques to help build in safeguards against the uses of informational media for propaganda or commercial exploitation of the learner.
<H3>Technology and Learning Modes</H3> 
The use of the media for educational purposes has historically served to broaden access to knowledge. The digital medium will not replace the oral, print or image media; it will simply transform the way in which they are used for educational purposes. An understanding of the new medium can be achieved by observing carefully how teaching methods are being altered to improve learning. It may helpful, therefore, to focus briefly on some basic learning processes and attempt to evaluate how information technology can contribute to their enhancement.
<H4>The Sequential Learning Mode</H4>
Most subject matters require moments of guided study of primary observed data or original material. Students benefit from instructional sequences based on the mentor’s knowledge of learning development. Well-designed computer courseware incorporates this knowledge and provides enhanced ease of access to instructional sources and sequences. The computer is also used to vary the instructional sequence according to individual learning styles, offering semi-linear variations on instruction with options for learner control. The computer can also collect information on the learning process and offer data for course improvement, student guidance and empirical research.
<H4>The Relational Learning Mode</H4>
Meaningful learning requires that information be contextualized and that the student discover relationships with other areas of knowledge. Computer-based reference materials assist in this process by providing the learner with rapid access to related information. The non-linear storage of information permits rich possibilities for exploration and provides support for learning that is driven by student query. Hypermedia links provide unlimited possibilities for multi-sensory support for different learning styles.
<H4>The Creative Learning Mode </H4>
Although reception and discovery learning are highly valued, students must be able to utilize what they have learned if they are to retain it. Computer-based learning offers tools that provide for integrating ideas, creating new knowledge, and aiding in self expression. Tools may be combined with the sequential and relational instructional materials to create learning environments, such as writing labs and simulations for exploring the sciences. The student need not be mystified by gaps between theory and application.
<H3>Educational Uses of the Media</H3>
The information age will require an education system that understands human learning and makes efficient use of the entire spectrum of information technology. Teachers will have to understand the media and guide their students in their meaning and use. The following is intended to analyze the value that each medium can bring to the educational process.
<H4>The Oral Medium and Validation of Knowledge</H4>
The impersonal nature of image media, print and computing make it unlikely that they will satisfy the normal desire of the student to understand the value of knowledge in personal terms. The classroom--or some gathering place where socialization can be combined with the learning experience--is likely to provide the best environment for testing the value of learning on a personal basis. Students want to ask, "What is worth learning?" The answer has to come from someone they trust, someone who will give a responsible answer. In time, of course, they must learn to provide this answer themselves.
<H4>The Print Medium and Synthesis of Knowledge</H4>
The print medium will continue to be valued for its power to provide access to powerful exemplars of human thought and syntheses of knowledge. Textbooks will no longer be valued for merely mapping the curriculum and providing consumable exercises and drill; these functions are done much more efficiently in other media. The successful text will provide an answer to the question, "What is worth keeping?"
<H4>The Image Medium and Visualization of Knowledge</H4>
Students who can visualize what they are learning about early in the educational process do not waste time chasing poorly formed hypotheses. New concepts derived from well-chosen exemplars that relate to the students experience lead to the ability to understand abstractions at the micro and macro levels. The educational use of visual imagery should answer the student’s question, "What is this all about?"
<H4>The Digital Medium and Utilization of Knowledge</H4>
The digital medium can provide educational material in all of the media mentioned above in a context that is interactive. The learner can take greater responsibility for driving the educational process and learn to use tools, such as word processors, spread sheets and the like, that will serve in the real world. The digital medium will help provide an answer to the question, "What can I do with what I know?"
<H3>Knowledge from Information</H3>
The computer is widely used for the creation, transmission and storage of information. These functions are essential to the educational enterprise, but they do not define it. The learner must internalize and systematize information to create knowledge that can be applied in a meaningful way. Teachers will continue to be valued for their ability to manage the developmental processes of education, not just serve as sources of information. The skillful teacher knows how to withhold information, if need be, to clarify essential concepts. 
<P>An understanding of the new information technologies is important for teacher training, especially since changes in the educational media alter methodologies. Which methods are simply enhanced by the digital medium? Which ones are deeply transformed by it? Educators must be prepared to re-examine teaching, learning, curriculum and governance as medium and method evolve.

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>I have always been impressed with how much more native speakers hear in their own language than I do.  The participants in a conversation, with nodding heads and animated faces, seem to process everything with ease.  The outsider, even with advanced language training, struggles to keep up.  For members of the culture, much is taken for granted and important communications take place without explicit linguistic reference.  To the novice, the flow of speech seems continuous, with no clear indication of even the boundaries of meaningful elements.  It seems there is not enough time to process the current input before the next utterance is presented to the ear.
	
<P>Instructors know, of course, that listening comprehension is a classic "learn-by-doing" task.  The learner must adopt the strategy of listening for key elements around which to construct meaning, all the way moving along with the flow of discourse.  In reader mode, of course, one may rescan the text to solve difficulties, since the reader controls how information reaches the eyes.  Listening is really quite different.  (You may read from left to right, but you can't listen from left to right!)  The instructor can not effectively ask the student to "listen faster," nor does study of vocabulary and grammar per se produce direct improvement in hearing at the rate native speakers speak.  Practice with tape recordings of spontaneous speech can be useful, but students report that it is difficult to maintain concentration for more than a brief period of time.  In any case, listening labs have not produced particularly dramatic improvement in comprehension.  Even when well designed, most tape recordings offer little opportunities for interaction; and once the content of a tape recording is understood, it offers no opportunity to rehearse rapid comprehension of novel utterances.
	
<P>Part of the problem, in my opinion, is that materials for listening comprehension are often designed as if hearing were solely an acoustic phenomenon.  With this understanding of the issue, producers of pedagogical materials take care to adhere to studio recording conditions.  Their objective is to eliminate background noise and emphasize ideal pronunciation to reduce what is considered undesirable variation in input.  In real life, of course, people talk at the same time, ambient noise masks speech sounds, and people do not pronounce words as consistently as the written language would lead us to believe.  Missing acoustic signals are more than compensated for by situational and contextual elements in the speech event.  Although acoustically enhanced recordings are extremely useful for establishing norms, they do not provide practice in dealing with the redundant signals of everyday, situational, listening comprehension.
	
<P>Relying on classroom exposure for situationally based listening comprehension is likewise constrained in presenting variation in the speech sample.  Students who become comfortable with an individual teacher's speech may resist changing to another instructor, even though variation in input is obviously an intrinsic part of learning to understand a foreign language.  Clearly, the learner must learn to distinguish what elements of linguistic input remain the same and which are different when there is variation in acoustic input, such as the speaker's age, gender, regional accent, style, or speech register.  These differences in speech input are essential ingredients of the learning environment.  A single instructor, no matter how talented, cannot provide the needed variation in sampling for proficient listening.
	
<P>On the other hand, simply dropping the student into an environment where nothing but authentic speech is available doesn't solve the problem either.  In the worst case, students who do not succeed begin to assume that they have no aptitude for language learning and drop out of instruction.  Immersion techniques require a lot of time on task and a lot of individual feedback so that the student can confirm or reject the countless interpretations available for raw speech percepts.  There is little provision for this process in most academic programs of language instruction.  It is an often heard comment among professionals that listening comprehension is a "neglected skill."

<H3>Cognitive Elements of Comprehension</H3>
	
<P>It is interesting to note that those who have addressed the listening comprehension problem (e.g., Stevick 1976, Brown 1980, Hatch 1983) take pains to point out that the qualitative aspects of practice are extremely significant.  That is, more is not always better, particularly if drill is based on rote learning procedures; for even if adequate speech samples are available, much more is involved in learning to understand what someone is saying, even in one's native language.  People "hear" what may be totally lacking in the acoustic input, principally because a significant portion of what people understand is supplied by the context of the speech event.  Native speakers draw on vast amounts of shared knowledge to construct meaning when they are listening.  It is not so much that the speech sounds "contain" meaning; it is rather that the speech sounds trigger meaning in the minds of the listener.  It is in this sense that we may speak of listening comprehension as being essentially cognitive, drawing on support from a number of sources available for general intelligence.
	
<P>Far from being a "passive" skill, listening requires the active creation of plausible messages from sometimes incomplete acoustic input.  As an example, consider this scene in which the husband, changing TV channels, comes across an old film that shows a very young Cary Grant in his first movie.  Relying chiefly on the actor's voice quality, the husband recognizes the actor and asks his wife (who is reading) to look at the screen.  She studies the screen for a moment before realizing who the actor is.  Here is the transcript of the actual exchange:
	
<P><DT><I>Example 1:  Telegraphic Speech
<DD>Husband:	Look, that's, uh...
<DD>Wife:	Oh.  Yes.</I>

<P>The reader can easily fill in the missing elements by assuming that both wife and husband share knowledge of the actor's movie career, that neither has seen the actor's first movie, and that the husband has a temporary lapse of memory concerning the actor's name (but she knows he knows who it is).
	
<P>The ability to fill in missing information, a commonplace in human behavior, has been termed "analysis by synthesis" by psychologists.  (See Clark and Clark 1977, especially Chapter 5, "Perception of Speech.")  The term refers to the strategy of internally generating or "shadowing" what people are saying (or doing) so that we may easily predict the next step, or at least reduce the number of possibilities to consider.  If you speak very slowly or deliberately, you may find that others do more than shadow: they actually finish sentences for you.  We take time to use our full processing capacity only when the situation is highly unusual or unexpected.  Without this kind of efficient information processing, we can easily become overwhelmed by input, which of course is exactly the situation the language learner is in.
	
<P>We deal with sensory overload by creating internal representations of the outside world so that we may deal more efficiently with information.  With learning, we cut down on processing time through a mechanism called "feedforward."  The physiological basis for this ability, the gamma efferent system, is a relatively recent discovery by brain specialists (Pribram 1971).  The phenomena accounted for by the discovery are very familiar, however.  Our nervous system allows us to anticipate, after learning, the various kinds of feedback that may reach the brain through the sensory system.  As long as no change from the norm is encountered, we notice very little, at least consciously.  A simple example is how the body adjusts to ambient temperature.  (The water is fine once you get in.)
	
<P>Although difficult to describe objectively, there is a mild discomfort or malaise felt when an unexpected sensation is experienced.  For example, I enter an elevator, press "down," and prepare unconsciously to descend.  A prior call, however, causes the elevator to go up instead, and I momentarily feel a kind of disequilibrium.  Much the same feeling is experienced when, in reality, I have reached the top of the stairway but, in the dark, I expect there to be another stair.  Likewise, a startling sensation is produced if I sit in a chair that is softer than expected.  I have even noticed an odd feeling when walking up an escalator that is under repair.  Although I can easily observe that it is not moving, I still feel motion as I step on.  These examples offer a generalization: In each case the feedback simply does not match the feedforward.
	
<P>Cognitive psychologists are quick to point out that we carry within our central nervous system a kind of "map" of the external world that we refer to continuously as we process information in our surroundings.  Cognitive maps offer redundant ways of dealing with problems in everyday life, from finding our way in the dark to opening a door with our arms full of groceries.  Highly skilled activities, such as playing a musical instrument from a printed score, require a kind of "fusion" of various representations of the music.  Even the amateur pianist can "hear" music in his or her head (its acoustic form), or "see" the notation of a familiar composition (its symbolic form), or "play" the motions of the fingers (its motor form).
	
<P>Similar effects of analysis by synthesis can be observed in the way humans process speech.  Most of what we recall is not retrieved from stored "tapes" of acoustic material; it is rather based on reconstructed "scenarios" that are consistent with what we have observed and learned.  Psychologists who have studied eye-witness testimony offer powerful evidence that memory is more a constructive process than a physical "thing."  Anyone who has played the parlor trick of passing a story from person to person around the room is impressed at the number of creative changes that occur as each intelligence reinterprets the input according to personal knowledge and bias.  A particularly interesting finding is that information that does not fit the cognitive schemata of the listener is simply not processed.  Experimenters have inserted an extraneous sentence into an otherwise coherent story to test recall of the intrusive element.  Most do not remember that it was even present in the narrative!
	
<P>A number of strategies have been identified by psycholinguists to account for the way humans process speech.  Although we teach grammar for a good understanding of syntactic parsing, there is good evidence that native speakers also use, perhaps even prefer, "semantic parsing" in their everyday listening comprehension.  That is, listeners simply fit content words to a scenario that they can easily construct from their knowledge of the world and society.  Some of the grammatical cues to meaning may not be actively processed if the message is thought to be understood because of the general meaning and context.  This strategy causes trouble only if precision is essential (as in the courtroom) or if hypothesis formation and deduction of meaning are required (as in scientific debate).
	
<P>Utterances taken out of context are often said to be misunderstood, especially if the syntactic structure is complex.  You may wish to try reading the following sentence to a colleague and then asking for an interpretation of the context that it refers to:
	
<P><I><DT>Example 2: Semantic Parsing
<DD>Since the doctor was not examined by the patient,
<DD>her lawyer filed a malpractice suit.</I>

<P>If the sentence is read hastily, it is possible to reconstruct a scenario in which the patient sued the doctor for malpractice:
		
<P><DD><I>doctor / not examine / patient / lawyer / sue</I>

<P>In reality, the syntactic structure offers a more complex and unexpected scenario:
		
<P><DD><I>patient / not examine / doctor / lawyer (whose?) / sue</I>
	
<P>Semantic parsing is often quite satisfactory for getting the gist of a narrative, especially when visual support or pragmatic constraints assist in the analysis.  Children (and second language learners), over time, also learn how to add syntactic parsing to their repertoire of strategies for arriving at meaning.  I recall a scene in which my daughter, about five years old, was reproached for using the guest towels to dry her hands.  When asked to explain why the towels were dirty, she defended herself in the following way:
		
<P><DD><I>I washed my hands because I dried them on the towel!</I>

<P>You have only to substitute the word "and" in place of the word "because" for the sentence to make perfect sense.  (That is, replace the subordinating conjunction, which would require a shift in the clause structure, with a coordinating conjunction that retains the clauses in the order of temporal events.)  Her attempted shift from semantic to syntactic structures to express causation was apparently more than my daughter could handle under the circumstances.
	
<P>A great deal of the skill in precise reading lies in the ability to make a correct syntactic parse, but a visual representation is naturally not available to the ear for rescanning, as is the case with the visual system.  Effective speakers use rhetorical devices to repeat important information and enlarge upon the imagery available to the hearer, whereas effective writers may exploit the more stable visual medium for effect (Ong 1982).  The lesson here is that complex structures (passive negatives with ambiguous scope of reference) make for bad writing and impossible listening.  We appear to rely on our store of likely images to mediate in the process of interpreting what we hear.  When these are lacking, we may fail altogether to make sense of the input.
	
<H3>Cues to Listening Comprehension</H3>
	
<P>Using the written word as a support for listening comprehension for learners has distinct limitations.  For one thing, the learner may skip to the text whenever a difficulty is encountered in hearing, and thus never learn to rely on the ear for information.  For another, there are cues available for the ear, such as intonation, that have no representation in writing.  Children begin to repeat the tune of language well before they master vocabulary and syntax.  It is as if humans find it easier to learn the music than the words; over time, however, the two become paired in an intimate way.  An easy example for speakers of English is to try to communicate by humming the words of a set phrase, such as "I don't know."  Most speakers will know exactly what you "said," if uttered as an answer to a content question, such as "What are you going to do?"
	
<P>A little more difficult exercise consists of trying to mismatch intonation and content.  The effect is a bit surreal, as the utterance will sound both familiar and strange at the same time.  For example, try the following exchange in you mind's ear: 
		
<P><DD><I>"Excuse me."
<DD>"You're welcome."</I>

<P>It may take a moment to realize that the intonation contours for "Thank you." / "You're welcome." and "Excuse me." / "No problem." can be identical.  Routine or frequently repeated phrases often become "stylized" in this way.  The point is that the redundant clues offered in the melodic structure of speech assist enormously in processing spoken language.  The printed word, obviously, is not the appropriate medium for learning to process intonation.
	
<P>Another example may help make the point, as well as relate intonation cues to acoustic processing through analysis by synthesis.  One evening, while listening to public broadcast radio at Cornell University, I noticed that the announcer used a particular intonation for reporting tie scores (which are rather common in hockey).  You may wish to rehearse the effect, noting that an unequal score, (e.g., Boston 3, Pittsburgh 2) does not sound the same as a tie score (e.g., Boston 3, Pittsburgh 3).  As Cornell was in the running for first place that particular year, I listened for the results and was surprised to note that I knew the game result well before (in milliseconds) the number was actually said.
	
<P><I><DT>Example 3: Meaning and Intonation
<DD>Uneven - Princeton 4, Brown 2
<DD>Uneven - Dartmouth 2, Columbia 1
<DD>Tie - Harvard 3, Cornell  ?</I>

<P>(If you wish to produce an unsettling effect on the listener, try reading an uneven score with tie score intonation, or vice-versa.  The information will be hard for others to process.)  Note that the "tie score" intonation is used in other utterances that contain information that is considered identical, such as "If Mary is for it, John is for it."
	
<P>The culturally determined associations available to native speakers as they listen to one another mediate comprehension in ways that the outsider cannot fully understand.  I recall an instance in which the transcribers of a Spanish conversation recorded the phrase, "Me llamo Elgar."  At least two others (including myself) confirmed the transcription, hearing clearly the acoustic sequence [ e l g a r ].  A native speaker immediately rejected the transcription, saying it should be [ e d g a r ].  We all listened again intently, trying to determine whether the sound in question was [ l ] or [ d ].  Finally our exasperated informant declared that the man's name was "Edgar" because "Elgar" does not exist in Spanish!  And that was that.
	
<P>A last example is offered as an illustration of the surprising role of cognition in the most routine processing of acoustic input.  The context is a situation in which a football game is playing in the background, barely attended to by others in the room because of preparations for a Thanksgiving meal.  The announcer says, in a matter of fact tone, the following:
	
<P><DT><I>Example 4:  Meaning and Rhythm
<DD>Over the middle and through the line, a penalty on the play.</I>

<P>Non-native speakers are to be forgiven if they do not "hear" what immediately came to my mind, no doubt because of the season of the year:
		
<P><DD><I>Over the river and through the woods, to Grandmother's house we go.</I>

<P>It turns out that the rhythmic structure of the two utterances is identical.  There is a familiar song associated with the line of verse that most members of my culture would recognize immediately.  
	
<P>Naturally the shared cultural associations illustrated by the example above are just the tip of the iceberg.  The rich array of material that mediates in comprehension of acoustic input, from childhood songs to works of art, should remind us of the depth of  training necessary for truly proficient listening comprehension.  But surely there is not enough instructional time to attend to such a vast curricular undertaking!  How can we provide our students with a learning environment that provides appropriate skills for going beyond acoustic input?

<H3>Multimedia and Listening Comprehension</H3>
	
<P>Current advances in computer-aided instruction offer some straightforward solutions to the problems sketched above.  Taking our cue from research in language learning, we should take care to augment our curriculum-based teaching program with a corpus-based learning environment.  This means that students must have access to authentic material if they are to develop appropriate feedforward mechanisms.  Computers support a meaningful learning environment for listening comprehension by combining visual, auditory, and textual information with interactivity.  Visual support is extremely efficient for providing context and for maintaining interest; textual information (for the literate) is an economical way to provide conceptual support.  Interactivity is extremely important, for students must have control of the rate of information presentation if they are to maintain comprehension when using authentic materials.
	
<P>In my analysis (Noblitt 1993), an adequate learning environment requires support of at least three modes of learning, which may be successfully enhanced by the use of computers.
<OL>
<LI>The sequential mode, familiar to anyone who has designed a syllabus, provides for a linear presentation of information and takes the student to areas that would not be discovered by browsing or other adventitious means.  Samples of speech, song, or works of literature are also sequential, but designed primarily for the expressive rather than analytical use of language.
<LI>The relational mode, familiar to anyone who has used reference works such as dictionaries or maps, provides support for tasks that are open-ended and that require critical thinking.  The gathering of relevant material for the task at hand is driven by student query.  The information thus acquired takes on meaning by its power to solve problems by analytical means.
<LI>The creative mode, involved in improvisational speech or original writing, provides support for learning-by-doing.  Often viewed as the primary objective of language study, the creative mode is essential for instruction stressing communicative competence.</OL>
	
<P>Interactive learning environments can easily incorporate the learning modes described above.  Students may comfortably observe the context of an utterance and process holistically all the redundant cues in the visual and acoustic modes.  At the same time they have recourse on demand to relational databases of information in textual form that supports analytical processing and creative use of language.  (See Noblitt 1995 for an example of an interactive multimedia application designed to assist the learner in listening comprehension.)
	
<P>An important motivational feature can be built in with authentic samples of speech and full-motion video.  The material provides an opportunity to observe the expressive use of language.  That is, students can observe the use of language that reflects esthetic, ethical, or cultural values in addition to purely the communicative or informational intent of an utterance.  Although the linguistic material is more complex in content, such examples of language use provide the student with insights that make language study engaging and rewarding.  Information technology provides an excellent medium for balancing the analytic or form-focused study of language with a synthetic or content focused learning environment.
	
<P>The question of balance in language skills is important.  Many of our students have learned well to perform in the sense of repeating a dialogue with tolerable accuracy.  However, the learner's attempt to enter into an authentic conversation may result in the awkward discovery that his or her ability to speak is not matched by an equal ability to hear.  That is, it is easier to ask a question than it is to understand the answer!  "Natural" approaches provide for balance by allowing for developmental staging in skill acquisition.  As shown by the following sample from child language acquisition, it is normal for listening comprehension to precede spoken ability.
	
<P><DT><I>Example 5:  Hearer and Speaker
<DD>What's your name?
<DD>Litha.
<DD>Litha?	
<DD>No! Litha.
<DD>Lisa?
<DD>Yeah.  Litha.</I>

<P>What elements in the learning environment assist the learner in gaining skill in processing both the cognitive and acoustic elements of listening?  Above all, the learner needs to deal with authentic samples of language in context.  Since native speakers of a language appear to listen more to the speaker's intent than raw acoustic input, it is important for the learner to appreciate how intended meaning is negotiated in another language.  (See Kramsch 1993, passim, and especially p.196, "The challenge of multimedia.")  Intent is informed by an elaborate set of cultural assumptions that are part and parcel of learning the elemental facts of a foreign language.  By observing visual and linguistic sensory inputs, the student is able to arrive inductively at intention .  The increased complexity of input through interactive multimedia thus enhances cognitive processing and renders the task meaningful.

<H2>Scholarship, Publishing and Computing:  Interactions in the Educational Marketplace</H2>
<H4>by James S. Noblitt</H4>
<P><HR><P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>Our mission at the IAT allows us to observe how the public and private sectors come together to discuss ways of doing business.  We note that the notion of value as applied to information technology in education takes different forms as we compare the contributions of the academy, publishers and the computing industry to educational innovation.  Scholars want to see evidence of added value in research and teaching before adopting technology; publishers want to see evidence of demand before investing in the production of quality products; technology vendors want to see a market for their goods and services before adapting to the demands of the educational marketplace.  Each has a viewpoint concerning inhibitors to the adoption of technology, but there appears to be little realization of the mutual dependencies involved.

<H3>The Profit Motive</H3>

<P>Attitudes toward "profit" represent a major cultural difference separating educators from the publishing and computing industries.  The lack of understanding on this point constitutes an inhibitor to the adoption of technology.  The not-for-profit education industry draws heavily on public and philanthropic support to accomplish its mission, thus scholars are not accustomed to assessing the economic value of activities such as instructional computing in higher education.  As one analyst puts it, "There is no metric in higher education comparable to money in business, and no goal comparable to profits . . . [As a result,] the accountability techniques of the business corporation are of little benefit to the education purposes of higher education."  (R. Birnbaum, How Colleges Work:  The Cybernetics of Academic Organization and Leadership, Jossey-Bass Publisher, 1988) 
 
<P>Within higher education, the concept of accountability techniques represents sharply differing concepts in the minds of educators focused on the outcomes of education and in the minds of administrators focused on the financial health of their institution.  Since the for-profit sector is more attuned to a business case than a plan for curriculum reform, it is not surprising that industry representatives have been more comfortable talking with administrators than with faculty.  However, the successful salesperson in publishing or the computer industry must learn to appreciate the concerns of the various clients in higher education: faculty attuned to what is valued by their particular discipline, computer support personnel interested in state- of-the-art technology,  and administrators searching for efficient solutions for instruction.
  
<P>There is little wonder that the dialogue between the private and public sectors has only begun to address the serious issues in curriculum reform raised by the new information technology.  But even here there are surprises.  Our experience has been that individuals in both the publishing and computing industries are highly sensitive to the qualitative issues facing education.  After all, our business leaders have all been through the system and hold opinions based on direct experience.  Given opportunity and encouragement, they participate fully in the intellectual debate concerning the role of education in our culture.  Publishers seek opportunities for leadership in quality control and distribution of educational materials; technologists seek opportunities for leadership in innovative design of hardware and software.  The tragedy is that we have not found the means to bring their collective knowledge and expertise to bear on the educational problems confronting our society.

<H3>The Matter of Timing</H3>

<P>Quite apart from the differing cultural points of view on what to do about implementing educational technology, there is a more subtle issue about when innovation is likely to be successful.   The issue of timing involves educators, publishers and technologists in an intricate dance of mutual dependence.  We shall return to these interconnections in the course of this series, but it will suffice at this time to point out that qualitative issues may render quantitative measures of the value of educational technology relatively meaningless.  Quality depends on timing.  (If something is not worth doing, it’s not worth doing well.)  For example, if the economy requires consolidation, innovation can be extremely disruptive.  If innovation is needed, moneys spent on continuing the status quo are a waste, regardless of the quality metric applied.  (This activity has been called "rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.")  The focus must be on what reform is needed and how productive change will take place.

<P>The role of information technology as change agent is complex and far-reaching.  The digital medium solves certain problems brought on by the information age, but it also introduces new ones.  We must, of course, be alert to the consequences of unintended side-effects as the learning environment is transformed.  If we are to take the metaphor of the "information high-way" seriously, we should reflect upon the fact that super-highways led to, among other things, a vast increase in the production of cars! 
 
<P>As we are fond of saying at the IAT, our emphasis must be on learning technology, not on information technology per se.  A major inhibitor in the minds of many educators is the question of the maturity of the new industry.  Without standards for sharing scholarly and pedagogical materials, the benefits of educational computing will be difficult to implement.  Happily, de facto standards appear to be emerging as educators have adopted a "bottom up" approach to materials production.  We are just beginning to see the creation of multimedia authoring and network navigation tools that are driven by genuine educational needs.  And textbook publishers, for example, are now deeply involved in seeking authors who can be creative in the new medium.

<H3>Resistance to Change</H3>

<P>Innovation can be exciting, but it can also be distressing.  We don’t like having to cope with a working environment for which we were not fully trained.  As an academic colleague likes to put it, "All change is bad."  His observation expresses the concern caused by the process of change, even when it is needed.  Change diverts energy from normal standards of productivity into new activities, often with uncertain outcomes.  The new information technology is a symbol of threat to a way of life; it represents the "disconnect" many educators feel between their background and training and the current needs of society.  We must recognize (if only to be able to put the issue aside) that the "information explosion"  redefines the conditions of psychological and economic well-being for ourselves and our students, and ultimately alters the dynamics of teaching and learning.

<P>Many of the elements driving innovation lie outside the direct control of the academy; it is nonetheless important to understand the strategic significance of the commercial sector, in particular the publishing and computing industries.  Educational publishers will bring their expertise to the task of creating materials that are commercially viable, that is, appropriate for broad distribution.  The publisher’s opportunity for leadership lies in underwriting significant software development.  Significant utilization of information technology will be impossible without this important service, simply because material that can’t be shared is not interesting in the scholarly domain.  The "shareware" concept, although attractive philosophically to the not-for-profit sector, generally does not produce high quality applications that can be used in broad educational reform.

<H3>Inhibitors</H3>

<P>Under the current system of rewards, individual faculty members as software developers have no incentive to go beyond proof of concept, much less writing error traps and full documentation.  Field testing, debugging and other steps necessary for commercial-grade applications are not feasible without significant levels of support.  Of course, the debate in academia between applied and theoretical scholarship is much older than the microcomputer.  The academic world, especially in this culture, tends to rate theory above application in its reward structure.  Publishers have long been aware of this fact and have compiled separate author profiles for successful textbook authors in theoretical and applied fields.

<P>New kinds of leadership and support are needed to address some powerful inhibitors.  A new kind of social "covenant" is needed to overcome the powerful inhibitors to change that we have identified here at the IAT.

<UL>
<LI><B>Educators</B> interested in software development are not always accustomed to the idea of team-work; they have been socialized to think "vertically," that is, to work within their own disciplines.  The most successful projects we have observed have joined faculty expertise, administrative leadership, and computer support services.

<LI><B>Publishers</B> face serious problems in making a transition to publishing in the digital medium.  The business case for software development for microcomputers depends critically on the cost of support for cross-platform development, as well as for competing operating systems in various stages of maturity.  Copyright issues are troublesome in the extreme.

<LI><B>The computing industry</B>, for its part, faces difficulties in making a business case for its dealings with higher education.  Because of intense competition, the hardware has dropped in profitability to the commodity level, which means that mass marketing techniques are required for business health.  In the absence of de facto or de jure standards for software design and production, it is difficult to create broad market appeal for a single educational  product.</UL>

<H3>The Need for Innovation</H3>

<P>Professional groups, such as the Textbook Authors Association and consultants to the publishing industry have, for the past four or five years, been developing strategies for diversifying the format of educational offerings.  There are a number of reasons for this activity:  (1) Students are less and less willing to pay the high prices charged for 4-color, illustrated texts.  Those who do buy them sell them back to the book store, and the market in second-hand books has reduced publishers profits.  (2) The industry sees less teacher demand for expensive texts and the ancillary accompanying material, like slides and tapes.  Some instructors prefer "custom" textbooks with no frills, or just-in-time publishing of selected material.  Many instructors hesitate  to require expensive textbooks and prefer to have them put on reserve in the library for their students.  (3) The publishing industry is faced with diversifying its offerings.  The printed textbook does a better job of basic exposition and synthesis -- it remains the preferred medium for reading extended narrative treatment -- but more students have computers, and well-designed multimedia instruction does a better job of instruction in areas like illustration, visualization, and interactivity.  (4) Diversification means that publishers will have to  find new ways for quality control and distribution of their material.  That means that  new "electronic editors" must be found or trained for ensuring good design and content.  New authoring techniques must be found for electronic publishing, and the educational establishment must rethink teacher training.  (5) Educational publishers have noted that their customers are more attracted to content than to medium per se.  That is, students and scholars are happy to deal with information in whatever form best suited for the acquisition of knowledge.  As long as the dynamics of interaction are correct, it does not matter whether the delivery system is book, CD-ROM, or network.

<P>A discussion of the market demand for learning materials would take us well beyond the purpose of this article.  Suffice it to say that the publisher’s business case must take into account who will purchase learning material (teachers, school boards, students) and in what medium (print, film, digital).  But the responsibility for determining the shape of the solution will likely be shared by the educational establishment, the information technology industry, and the publishing industry.  A cooperative effort is needed to produce a meaningful combination of content, platform, and quality control.  The initiative for the effort is likely to be driven by the publishing industry, already accustomed to the use of computing for printing instructional and reference materials as well as network collaboration with authors, editorial consultants, and marketing staff.  Electronic distribution of materials through networks is a logical extension of this process, as the business case suggests possibilities for higher quality, greater access, and lower distribution costs.

<H3>Interactive Learning</H3>

<P>The success of the familiar print textbook was based in part on well-defined roles for author and publisher in its development.  As interest now focuses on interactive learning materials, developers are facing interesting new issues of production, distribution, and quality assurance.  Everyone is for quality, but quality means different things to different people:

<UL>
<LI><B>Administrators</B> are likely to focus on the issues of effectiveness and productivity.  They promote learning environments that improve the quality of education while reducing the costs of implementation.

<LI><B>Faculty</B> are concerned about educational content.  They value interactive materials that provide more student exposure to authentic sources, and they like material that can be easily integrated with existing curricula.  

<LI><B>Computer support personnel</B> are responsible for servicing the high technology learning environment .  They like interactive materials that rest on a solid basis of industry support and for which adequate maintenance is feasible with limited resources.

<LI><B>Publishers</B> think of quality as excellent material produced in a timely fashion.  They need to know if such materials can compete successfully in the marketplace and whether they can absorb the expense of integrating their software offerings with multiple networks, operating systems, and hardware platforms.</UL>

<P>Multimedia materials will not so much replace textbooks as transform them.  Publishers say that the glossy, 4-color textbook with rich ancillary materials has become too expensive  to compete with the relatively cheap CD-ROM medium.  The problem for publishers is how to build a business plan that shifts costs from printing to software development.   In the classical print paradigm manuscript review was one of the least expensive parts of the publishing process.  Not so with software, since the equivalent of a manuscript does not exist until extensive effort (and cost) has been incurred in the application development.  Once a viable product is in hand, however, manufacturing costs are relatively minor.

<P>Educators are generally pleased to see the spectrum of instructional tools broadened to include interactive visual, acoustic, and textual elements.  Compound documents are not only rich in educational content, they also introduce new elements of composition and graphic design for instruction.  Particularly attractive is the fact that the computer makes it possible for the learner to make choices that determine both the kind of material presented and the rate of information flow.  Hypermedia documents open up the ability to follow relationships among ideas.  Timely access to relevant information is intellectually arousing for the student.  These features create a learning environment where the student can interact with more authentic learning material.

<P>Educators are observing that multimedia materials have considerable power to engage students in learning.  Instructors are pleased to see the primary material of their subject matter available to the student for observation and interaction.  These functions go well beyond the ability to entertain, a term that educators associate with the for-profit sector.  The not-for-profit motive of the educational establishment is focused on the long-term achievement of students and is driven by a sense of responsibility for the student and for society.  They wish to see the new technology give wider access to information to their students, freeing them to concentrate on the creative aspects of teaching.

<P>Educators tell us that they value interactive learning environments that allow them to share primary observed data with their students and provide the tools for performing operations on the data.  It is very satisfying for educators to demonstrate to others the interest that their subject matter holds.  A successful demonstration of the methodology of the discipline also lessens the tension that is felt between teaching and research.  Innovations that support these activities generally remove inhibitions to the adoption of technology.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>  
 
<P>Naturally the computing industry needs software to sell its goods; and academics need publishers for product development; but publishers need an installed base for market development.  As they say here in North Carolina, "That dog chases its tail!"

<P>The mutual dependencies discussed in the preceding section can lead to stalemate, or they can lead to creative synergy.  The keys to a positive outcome are participation and communication.  Academics need to analyze how information technology is actually used for educational purposes and inform the computing industry about their needs.  Above all, scholars need to contribute their knowledge to the creation of effective educational materials.

<P>Successful commercialization can serve the interests of all involved.  For example, we have noted at a number of institutions that computers placed in lecture halls are not heavily used.  People only trust one computer, their own.  They need to know its state of configuration and that the files are up to date.  Above all, they need to be assured that it will function reliably and in a timely fashion without extensive set-up time.  This points to personal ownership, which is now feasible with the development of the current class of laptop computers and docking stations.  The laptop permits the educator to keep important material at hand while at home, in the office, or in the classroom.  The same computer serves for the various modes important to the scholarly lifestyle: research, administrative duties, and classroom presentation.  In this model, institutional support is required for communication (e-mail) and classroom display, but not for lab maintenance.  The arrangement may be extended to student computing as well, which makes it possible for some of the costs of life-cycle budgeting to be passed on to the consumer.

<P>Educational publishers, for their part, want to know how to bring  their expertise to the task of creating materials that are commercially viable.  Their opportunity for leadership lies in underwriting significant software development.  The scholarly community will need heavy involvement from the commercial sector if excellent materials are to be created for educational purposes.  If higher education is not involved in this important enterprise, the creation of materials for general education are likely to pass to those who control the mass media. 

<P>Just as the scholarly community will need heavy involvement from the commercial sector for the creation of excellent educational materials, educational publishers will need the participation of scholars in materials design.  If higher education is not involved in this important enterprise, the creation of materials for general education is likely to pass to the mass media specialists with backgrounds in gaming, advertising, and entertainment.  The computing industry, for its part, will need input on lifestyle and content issues at this critical juncture in the development of educational computing.  

<P>Cross-platform and standards-based instructional technology offers a great deal of promise for the educator, if for no other reason than it has capabilities that offer publishers and authors a better chance for wide adoption.

<STRONG><EM>Overview</EM></STRONG>
<P>
One of the most pressing dilemmas our society faces today is how to
stay competitive in a world increasingly saturated with new
technologies. Many, if not most, educators are well aware of the need
to prepare students for the high-technology work force, and as a result
have concentrated in recent years on expanding the uses of technology
in the classroom to meet those needs. Unfortunately, the preliminary
cost of incorporating new technologies is imposing, and many are
reticent to commit to such a venture. The lack of sufficient teacher
education in the use of technology is also a problem.  	
<P>
Regardless of these obstacles, most educators still agree that not
investing in new educational technologies is imminently more costly to
our society in the long run. Continuing to implement new technologies
in the classroom is a must if we are to meet our students' needs for
the future. But in the face of dwindling educational budgets, where can
educators find sufficient funding? This document offers resources on
where and how to find funding for computer technology projects in
higher education.
<P>
Note: Many of the materials listed in this resource bibliography are
available through Federal Depository Libraries, local Foundation
Centers, cooperative grants libraries and some individual campus
libraries. We recommend that you review a copy of these publications
before purchasing them to insure that they address your particular
needs and interests.

<P>
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) refers to the format used by World-Wide Web documents to locate other files. A URL gives the type of resource being accessed (e.g., ftp, telnet, web, etc.) and the path of the file. The format used is:
<P>
<STRONG>protocol://host.domain[:port]/path/filename</STRONG>
<P>
... where <STRONG>protocol</STRONG> can be one of:
<P>
<STRONG>http://</STRONG>	a file on a World-Wide Web server
<BR>
<STRONG>file://</STRONG>	a file on your local system (for example, your hard drive)
<BR>
<STRONG>ftp://</STRONG>	a file on an anonymous FTP server
<BR>
<STRONG>gopher://</STRONG>	a file on a Gopher server
<BR>
<STRONG>telnet://	</STRONG>	used to connect to a remote computer and run a program on it
<P>
... where <STRONG>host.domain</STRONG> is the site's Internet address:
<P>
www.iat.unc.edu     (an educational site)<BR>

Multimedia uses the power of the computer to combine voice, music,
still pictures, full-motion video and text into an integrated,
interactive package invaluable for teaching. Most educators, however,
do not have the time or the money to create all their own resources as
well as incorporate them into multimedia applications. There are
abundant resources currently available for such people, created and
stored in a variety of formats for the convenience of the developer.  A
collection of vendor catalogs can be a valuable tool for selecting
multimedia materials. The following is a list of sources of CD-ROMs,
laserdiscs, videotapes and other resources for multimedia instruction
and development.

Is there a Smart Card in your future? What are Smart Cards, and who is using them? Industry, government, and educational institutions are increasing their use of Smart Cards as cash replacements, for identification cards, and to record and store data in a highly-portable medium. This surge in use can be attributed to factors such as the maturing of the technology (the cards are getting smarter), decreasing costs, increasing need for transaction security, and the move towards a "cashless society." Find out how Smart Cards are changing how we do business and if there is a place for them in your organization.

<H3><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H3>

<P>Is your campus looking for ways to focus more on the student? In this video, our panel of experts demonstrates and discusses how information technology can streamline campus services to make your institution more competitive by creating a student-centered environment. You will discover how:

<UL><LI>Students can gain secure electronic access to review their records, order transcripts, track academic progress - 24 hours a day.
<LI>Faculty and staff can focus on the students' individual needs rather than answering routine questions.
<LI>Students can use a new multimedia tool to explore subjects, take charge of their learning and create sophisticated multimedia applications.</UL>

<P>Plus, see how schools across the country have significantly increased their focus on students by using information technology resources, including information kiosks, multimedia learning tools and more.

<H3><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H3>

<P>At an increasing number of educational institutions, technology is finding its way into the classroom and transforming the experience of teaching and learning. In this video we explore the art of creating classrooms that match technological form with pedagogical function. You will discover how to:

<UL><LI>Configure your classroom to address shifts in the teaching/learning paradigm - from lecture-based models to student-based models to collaborative models.
<LI>Incorporate the six basic elements of instructional technology - microcomputers, networks, multimedia, display systems, student response systems and control systems.
<LI>Assign each class to the classroom configuration that best meets its curricular requirements.</UL>

<P>You'll see how different classroom configurations not only facilitate different kinds of classroom interaction, but also create new opportunities for teaching and learning.

<P>Campus executives face ever-growing pressures - diminishing resources, increased competition for students, and public demand for accountability and cost containment. In this video, our panel of academic executives and information technology leaders will discuss the concept of a national learning infrastructure and how it will help meet these challenges at a national level. You will discover:

<UL><LI>How national learning efforts relate to the Internet and the national information infrastructure.
<LI>How current technology and sociology affect the development of this infrastructure.
<LI>Why this infrastructure is essential to future academic and public policy development.
<LI>How institutions, organizations and companies can collaborate to implement a learning infrastructure that links the country.</UL>

<P>You'll also see why national strategies to incorporate technology into education will help add value to instruction, increase access to higher education, and address concerns about the cost of education.

<P>Public education is in transition. Public leaders and educational leaders alike believe that education must be restructured if it is to remain the cultural and economic foundation of a prosperous democracy into the next century. But there are more exhortations to restructure the public schools than prescrip-tions for doing so. Perhaps the most promising vehicles for change are the same computer and video networks and technologies that are driving the industrial economy into the knowledge economy along the "information superhighway."

<P>But higher education, federal and state governments, and the private sector will have to work together with the public schools if the emerging National Information Infrastructure is to become a learning infrastructure that enables the public schools to improve learning outcomes while serving as a primary socializing force for the nation’s children. This video explores the possibilities from a variety of perspectives.

<H3><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H3>

<P>Computer conferencing is an asynchronous (store and forward) way of communicating that works similarly to e-mail and listserves. However, computer conferencing software is designed specifically for text-based group discourse. It has special features that enable and enhance group communication and projects. Because it is asynchronous, computer conferencing can reduce the constraints of time- and place-based instruction, both on campus (lectures) and off-campus (two-way video distance education).  

<P>In this video you will visit four different campuses and meet six faculty who will demonstrate the use of computer conferencing in a wide range of courses and with diverse student populations. You'll also learn how to convert your own lecture-based courses to computer conferenced courses.

<P>You can examine the benefits of computer conferencing from both the teacher's and learner's points of view, with emphasis on issues such as motivation, student interaction, empowerment, and depth and understanding of subject matter through dialogue. You will see computer conferencing tools ranging from e-mail and screen capture software to more sophisticated applications such as Lotus Notes&#174; and FirstClass&#174;.

<P>"In this article, I [Don Langham] relate Socrates's critique of writing in the Phaedrus to a relatively new form of CMC known variously as MUD, MOO, and MUSH, which I will refer to as MOO. MOO environments provide an interesting perspective on how communication and transportation media affect human interaction, on how electronic communication can produce a sense of co-presence and interaction quite unlike that associated with other secondary orality media such as the telephone. Indeed, I believe that these virtual realities stand as an answer to Socrates's critique of writing, and to modern condemnations of electronic media."

<STRONG>Shute, Valerie, and Lisa Gawlick. "Practice Effects on Skill Acquisition, Learning Outcome, Retention and Sensitivity to Relearning." <EM>Human Factors</EM>  37, no. 4 (December 1995): 781-803.  </STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Tom's Summary of the Study:</STRONG><BR>
Subjects with no knowledge of aviation were divided into four groups to receive computer-based tutoring in flight engineering (navigation).  The tutoring program was divided into two segments, each containing several blocks of practice questions.   All groups received practice problems.  There were two practice problem conditions: extended (E) blocks of 12 problems and abbreviated (A) blocks of 3 problems.  Groups received all extended, (E-E), all abbreviated (A-A) or mixed (A-E, E-A) problem blocks.  Subjects did not know which group they were in, so the mixed groups experienced a change in practice problem block size.  Both groups were self-paced.  
<P>
The large block group performed better on the practice problems than the small block group.  At the conclusion of their training, the subjects were tested. There were no significant differences among practice conditions on posttest scores!   The authors expected to find better performance to coincide with working larger numbers of practice problems, reasoning that the more time spent in learning should equate to better performance. When tested two years later, the mixed (A-E, E-A) groups performed significantly better than subjects in either of the other two test conditions.  

<P>In the flight engineering training all students used the same tutoring resource.  The mode of use differed, however.  The extended block (E-E) group spent a more total time the study process than the abbreviated (A-A) group.  The small block (A-A) group spent more time (X1.8) in the tutoring resource than did the extended group.  

<P>
What might this mean?  How might it be applied to technology-enhanced instruction?  It appears that students learn the most from the first few questions.  Subsequent practice does little to improve performance.  Also, the unexpected change in pace in the mixed (A-E, E-A) groups kept the students "on their toes" in some way.

<P>
<STRONG>Tom's Summary of the Study:</STRONG><BR>
Carlson and Yaure reported three studies which demonstrated that randomized practice schedules produced poorer acquisition performance, but better retention compared to massed block practice sessions.  Clearly, the nature of questioning affects the students outcome.

<H2>Creating MacWebApp archives</H2><HR>
<P>
MacWebApp provides several features that you can use to perform special
installation tasks for your application. Do the following 3 steps
to create a MacWebApp archive.
<OL>
<LI>Create a Stuffit archive that contains the application you
want people to download and run. If you don't already have
a tool to create the Stuffit archive you can get a shareware version
of Stuffit Lite from the <A HREF="http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Abstracts/cmp/HyperArchive.html">Info-Mac 
HyperArchive</A>
or see <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/documents/sharewaresites.html">FTP sites for Apple-related shareware...</A>
for other software repositories.
<LI>You should name your archive with the extension .mwa so that
the web server can recognize the type.
<LI>You must get the site administrator to configure the web server
to associate the extension .mwa with the MIME type application/macwebapp.
</OL>
<P>
You can specify special installation instructions by creating a plain text file
called <I>MacWebApp</I> that you include with your application in the Stuffit
archive.
The first line should contain the identifier [MacWebAppAutoInstall]
as the only thing on the line. Subsequent lines have one or more
of the following identifiers in any order followed by = (equal
sign) and the specified value. There should be no spaces
between the equal sign and the value.  When the value is a list
of multiple file names, use commas to separate the names.
The last character in the file should be a RETURN.
<P>
The meaning and format of the value
for each identifier is described below.
<DL>
<DT>ApplicationName<DD>
  Specifies name of file to run.  This is useful if there is more
  than one application in your archive.

<DT>InstallDirectory<DD>
  Specifies name for the folder into which the archive is extracted.

<DT>ReadmeFile<DD>
  Specifies the name of the readme file if any.

<DT>NeedToRestart<DD>
  Specify "yes" or "no" to indicate whether the system needs to
  be restarted after installation.

<DT>RebuildDesktop<DD>
  Specify "yes" or "no" to indicate whether the desktop needs to
  be rebuilt after installation.

<DT>CopyToControlPanels<DD>
  Specify one or more files to move to the system Control Panels
  folder.

<DT>CopyToExtensions<DD>
  Specify one or more files to move to the system Extensions
  folder.

<DT>CopyToPreferences<DD>
  Specify one or more files to move to the system Preferences
  folder.

<DT>AliasToStartupItems<DD>
  Specify one or more files to alias in the system Startup Items
  folder.
</DL>
Here is an example MacWebApp file.
<pre>
[MacWebAppAutoInstall]
ApplicationName=DinoDancers
ReadmeFile=Read Me First!
InstallDirectory=DinoDancers 1.0

<H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
<B>Why do I receive messages like "An error occurred while executing an
object script: Finder got an error: AppleEvent timed out. (-1712)" or
"Unable to continue because FaceSpan Extension is missing or would
not open. (0)"?</B>
<P>
Your system software does not meet the minimum requirements required to run
MacWebApp, which are
<UL>
<LI>A system version <I>later</I>  than 7.1.1, OR 
<LI>System 7.0 or later with a scriptable version of the Finder
installed (typically Finder version 7.1.3 or later) and the extensions
<I>AppleScript</I>  and <I>Finder Scripting Extensions</I>  installed.
</UL>
<P>
<B>I am always told that "Stuffit Expander needs your attention...."
When I look at Stuffit Expander, it is asking where it should
install the software, even though I have already told MacWebApp
where to install.  How do I fix this?</B>
<P>
In Stuffit Expander, select Preferences, choose Destination Preferences,
and click on "Same as Original."
<P>
<B>How do I enable virus scanning?</B>
<P>
MacWebApp does not support automatic virus scanning.  If you want to manually
scan
files before executing them, turn on "Prompt before running program"
in the MacWebApp preferences.
<P>
<B>Why do I receive an "Unable to continue because project script
could not be saved (-61)." message every time I quit?</B>
<P>
MacWebApp is locked (check the Get Info box in the Finder) or is on
a locked disk volume, such as a network disk.  This is not a serious
problem, but it might prevent you from saving your preferences.
<P>
<b>MacWebApp installs software and starts the application with no problem.
However, when I quit the newly installed application and go back to MacWebApp,
the
cursor spins indefinitely.  What's going on?</b>
<p>
Did you start any other applications after MacWebbApp started the newly
installed application?  If so, you must quit those applications too
before MacWebApp recognizes that it's time to uninstall the software.
This is typically a problem when MacWebApp starts the new application
and then you start another application to look at documentation or a
ReadMe file.
<P><P>Go back to the <A HREF="index.html">MacWebApp Homepage</A>.

<P>This page will be updated before, during and after the broadcast.  To help stay tuned to the changes, mark this URL with the <A HREF="http://www.netmind.com/URL-minder/URL-minder.html">URL-Minder</A>.

<P><B>REMINDER</B>: During the week of the broadcast, November 13-17, the IAT will be monitoring a discussion list on computer conferencing issues in education. Our broadcast panel and interview participants will be available to answer any questions you may have about computer conferencing or the case studies we examined during the broadcast. We also encourage you to discuss these issues amongst yourselves. To subscribe to the list, send the message <KBD>subscribe iatforum yourname</KBD> to <A HREF="mailto:listserv@unc.edu">listserv@unc.edu</A>. For questions regarding the listserv or the broadcast itself, contact <A HREF="mailto:barbara_bickell@unc.edu">Barbara Bickell</A>, IAT Communications Program Manager.


<H3>Supplementary Materials</H3>
<UL>

<P><LI><B>Kathryn Conway</B>, Senior Analyst for Distributed Learning at the IAT, welcomes you to the broadcast and introduces the concept of computer conferencing in education.  For more information, see the IAT document <A HREF="../../../guides/irg-36.html">"Computer Conferencing Software Vendors List."</A>

<P><LI><B>Stephen J. Andriole</B>, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer for CIGNA Corporation, teaches his software engineering classes at <A HREF="http://www.drexel.edu/">Drexel University</A> without any classroom meetings. Students use Lotus Notes for computer conferencing, along with online design tools to design software and to review and analyze each other's designs. Stephen will discuss what computer conferencing requires of teachers and the flexibility and benefits it gives to students. For more information, you can read his article in the October issue of T.H.E. Journal, <A HREF="http://thejournal.com/october/10andriole.html">"Asynchronous Learning Networks: Drexel's Experience"</A> or see the IAT document, <A HREF="../../../guides/irg-45.html">"Lotus Notes Information on the Web."</A>

<P><LI><B>Diana Oblinger</B>, Solutions Manager, IBM Higher Education, will discuss student collaboration in the classroom. For more information, read her article, <A HREF="../../oblinger/oblinger.html">"Educational Alternatives Based on Communication, Collaboration and Computers."</A>

<P><LI><B><A HREF="http://www.rio.maricopa.edu/">Rio Salado Community College</A></B> provides an opportunity for working adults to obtain an education by taking courses online and asynchronously from home. These students would not be able to participate in a more traditional course that required them to come to classes on campus. Some of Rio Salado's students will tell us how they feel about using computer conferencing to "go to school" electronically. And their teacher will tell us about her role now that she doesn't have lectures to deliver. Mary Hannaman, Program Director for Academic Studies, and Linda Collins, Coordinator for Information Technology Services, will describe the kind of support services they provide the students and their low-cost approach to making technology available to the students.

<P><LI><B>Burks Oakley</B> is Associate Director of the <A HREF="http://w3.scale.uiuc.edu/scale/">Sloan Center for Asynchronous Learning Environments</A> and Professor of Electrical Engineering at the <A HREF="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</A>. Burks teaches his classes using FirstClass computer conferencing software in combination with online circuit analysis software. His students work on their homework online, getting assistance from online tutors that allow them to work more efficiently and master concepts more thoroughly. These online homework sessions replace regular classroom tutorial sessions. Burks and the other instructors use the same computer conferencing application to conduct online meetings with the tutors. These electronic meetings save valuable time usually spent trying to coordinate schedules for face-to-face organizing sessions. For more information, you can read his article, <A HREF="http://www.sloan.org/oakley/Maine/index.html">"A Virtual Classroom Approach to Learning Circuit Analysis"</A> or see the IAT document <A HREF="../../../guides/irg-40.html">"FirstClass Information on the Web."</A>

<P><LI><B>Steve Nickles</B>, Bess and Walter Williams Distinguished Professor of Law at <A HREF="http://www.wfu.edu/School-of-Law/">Wake Forest University</A>, has used computer conferencing in Law courses at Wake Forest and at the University of Minnesota to discuss issues relating to their legal case studies. Study and discussion of these cases asynchronously prepares students for a more in-depth and exacting oral analysis of the cases in the classroom. For more information, check out the extensive legal and financial document database at <A HREF="http://www.westpub.com/">West Publishing</A>.

<P><LI><B><A HREF="../../roberts/roberts.html">Lowell Roberts</A></B> is a Research Fellow at the IAT specializing in asynchronous learning and instruction. He has used computer conferencing as an
instructional platform since 1987 and has written and presented
extensively on learning, pedagogy and conferencing, including
workshops at EDUCOM '94 and <A HREF="gopher://cause-gopher.colorado.edu/11/conferences/CAUSE94/precon-seminars/">CAUSE '94</A>.  His <A HREF="../../roberts/template.html">Template for
Converting Classroom Courses to Distributed, Asynchronous
Courses</A> is available from the IAT Web site. Formerly the
Director of the <A HREF="http://www.sunycentral.edu/clt/CLTHOME/textbased.html">SUNY Center for Learning and Technology</A>,
Roberts is the architect of <A HREF="http://www.sunycentral.edu/clt/CLTHOME/sunywide.html#sloan">MHRLN</A> (merlin), now the SUNY
Learning Network, a distributed education network delivering
courses by Lotus Notes that connects 8 campuses, homes and
businesses in the Hudson Valley of New York State. MHRLN was
demonstrated at <A HREF="http://www.educom.edu/web/conf.semi/educom95/conftracks.html#scholarships">EDUCOM '95</A>.</UL>

<H3><I>Dear Colleague:</I></H3>
<P>We at the IAT welcome your interest in our programs.  We believe that information technology is education's most promising lever for improving the quality of learning and containing the cost of instruction.  The content and structure of our satellite broadcasts, hands-on workshops, custom sessions and other offerings described in this brochure reflect this belief and are the direct result of our experience and your advice.  
<P>We have programs designed to assist you, whether your interests lie in the instructional applications of multimedia and networking technologies, in supporting or managing such technologies or in applying them as vehicles for change in your organization.  We view learning as a richly human undertaking that is most likely to succeed when the learner is a willing party to a social contract that guides learning and adds value to its accomplishment.  Information technology is a means, not an end.  This philosophy shapes both the selection of content for our programs and their delivery.  
<P>With generous financial and technical support from our partner, IBM, we have steered a course for six years that allows us to work with the latest technologies in an educational context and, thereby, to understand educational needs and to respond to these needs with varied national program offerings.  These offerings are designed to meet the needs of public schools, community colleges, four-year colleges and universities, continuing education programs, and training programs in the commercial sector.  
<P>Try us.  Visit our facilities to learn and to share your experiences.  Tune in to our satellite broadcasts.  Utilize our Internet resources.  And let us know the results. 
<P>Sincerely, <A HREF="../publications/graves/graves.html">William H. Graves</A>

<P>This technical paper has two purposes:
<UL>
<LI>To introduce administrators and staff of colleges and universities to the assistive technology that helps the physically disabled student use a computer; and
<LI>To refer those who need more specific information -- whether on products and prices, or on agencies that work with and assist the disabled -- to resources in their area. 
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></STRONG></FONT>
<P>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), approved by Congress in
1990, has broad implications for higher education. Although colleges
routinely offer disabled students services such as interpreters and
readers, elevators, wheelchair ramps and curb cuts on streets, access
to computers is not as widespread. The ADA not only requires employers
to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the disabled in a job or
work environment, but also mandates that colleges and universities give
disabled students equal access to computers on public campuses.

<P>The ADA reinforces two earlier laws that had a profound effect on
American education: the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and its successor,
Section 504. The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against
the handicapped at institutions receiving or benefiting from federal
funds. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which took effect in
1977, requires the removal of barriers that prevent the disabled from
participating in higher education.

<P>The ADA is likely to have two long-term effects on higher education:
<OL>
<LI>Increased enrollment of disabled students, many of whom would have been too discouraged to apply for admission before passage of the ADA.
<P><LI>Financial savings to colleges and universities. One-time expenditures on assistive technology for disabled students will be more than recouped as the jobs of readers and helpers become obsolete. In addition, as the independence and self-esteem of disabled students on campus increases, so too should retention rates for these students.
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG><A NAME="assist">Assistive Technology Defined</A></STRONG></FONT>

<P>Computers were designed to perform at maximum efficiency when used by
the nondisabled. But almost all of us employ some type of adaptive
technology when using the computer. Adaptive technology ranges from
wearing eyeglasses or wrist supports, to simply adjusting the
brightness of the screen display or the height and angle of the
monitor.

<P><B>Broadly defined, assistive technology includes any device or piece of
equipment that increases the independence of a disabled person</B>. 

<P>Assistive technology for the disabled, of course, is not new. For instance, the wheelchair has long been an indispensable assistive device for those with impaired mobility.

<P>The distinction between adaptive technologies employed by the
nondisabled and assistive technologies for the disabled blurs at times.
Some of the assistive technologies designed for the disabled have
proven so ergonomically sound that they have been incorporated as
standard features. One such example is the placement of the keyboard
on/off switch, which was designed so that people with motor impairments
would not have to reach to the back of the machine to turn the power on
and off.

<P>Assistive technology has increased enormously the ability of the
disabled to lead independent lives. Computer-based environmental
control units allow disabled users to turn on lights and appliances and
open doors from a wheelchair. Augmentative communication devices
enable those who cannot speak to voice thoughts and needs using touch-
or light-activated keyboards coupled to synthetic speech systems. Screen reading programs for the blind, screen magnification systems for those with low vision, and special ability switches that permit the mobility-impaired to use a computer are only a few examples of the technology by which the disabled gain access to the computer screen and keyboard.

<P>Although this paper addresses only those assistive
technologies that help the disabled use a computer, more information on
environmental control technologies and augmentative communication may
be obtained through many of the resources listed in the <A HREF="http://projects.iat.unc.edu/atwr/current.htm">Assistive Technology Web Reporter</A>.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG><A NAME="problem">Problem Areas for the Disabled in Computer Access</A></STRONG></FONT>

<P>The disabled user wants access to the personal computer or network
workstation for the same reasons as the nondisabled. However,
modifications and even alternatives to standard computer hardware and
software are often necessary to make the computer accessible to the
disabled user.  

<P>The standard personal computer system -- disk drive, keyboard, mouse,
monitor and screen -- can present barriers to certain disabled users. Some common access problems are discussed below:

<UL>
<LI><B>Disk drive</B> -- Handling diskettes is impossible for some users due to lack of strength or dexterity. In addition, those with impaired mobility may not be able to turn the computer on or off if the power switch is located to the rear of the hardware, as is frequently the case.

<P><LI><B>Keyboard</B> -- The standard QWERTY keyboard used on most personal computers is often inaccessible to people with impaired mobility or fine motor control. Many disabled users do not have the strength required to press the keys on a standard keyboard. Those with limited range of motion are not able to move their hands easily from the alphabetic keypad to the arrow keys, function keys or number keypad. Other users with uncontrolled or involuntary hand movements make frequent typing errors by pressing the wrong key, or by pressing a key longer than normal, inadvertently activating the automatic key-repeat feature of many keyboards.

<P><LI><B>Mouse</B> --Using a standard two- or three-button mouse may not be possible for those with impaired vision, mobility or motor control; successful use requires not only sufficient vision to follow the graphical representation of the mouse on-screen, but also adequate fine motor control and strength to activate and control the mouse. Manipulating text and graphic displays by clicking, pointing and dragging with the mouse is an acquired computer skill for all users, and requires considerable practice before mastery. Use of a mouse also requires sufficient strength and motion in the shoulder and arm to position and manipulate the device on the desktop or mousepad.

<P><LI><B>Monitor and Screen</B> -- The screen display is not accessible to blind users or those with low vision without magnification or text-to-speech conversion. On the other hand, the screen display is accessible to the deaf user, but requires modification so that audible error messages or "beeps" are converted to text that the deaf user can read.</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG><A NAME="intent">Intended Users of the Technologies</A></STRONG></FONT>

<P>Five areas of human functioning -- the ability to see, to hear, to move
about freely, to speak and to learn -- are so critically important that
by almost any criteria, irreversible loss of any one of these abilities
is disabling. Among college and university students, access to
computers is most often compromised by impairments of vision, hearing
and mobility.

<P>For the disabled user with low vision, access to the computer requires
one or more means of assistance: speech, large print or Braille. The
blind user employs speech, Braille, or a combination of the two.

<P>The hearing-impaired or deaf user usually adapts most easily to using
the computer, since the standard medium of exchange between user and
computer is visual. Often only minor modifications, such as an
alternative to the audible warning beep, are needed for this user.

<P>Users with impaired mobility and motor disorders must be evaluated
carefully so that their best remaining function is incorporated in the
plan of access to the computer. The ability to stand and walk
unassisted, the range of motion of the joints and spine, and any loss
of muscle strength, motor control or coordination are all considered
when selecting the appropriate assistive technologies. A disabled user
whose best voluntary, controlled movement is the raising of an eyebrow
can be fitted with a switch to access the keyboard. Those with
impaired mobility use alternative input devices such as joysticks,
ability switches and modified keyboards. Keyguards cut down on extra
keystrokes, while software modifications deactivate the automatic
keystroke repeat feature.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Current Technologies</STRONG></FONT>

<P><B><A NAME="visual">Visual Impairments</A></B>

<P>The technology available to disabled computer users who are blind or
have low vision is extensive. The choice of the appropriate technology
depends on a number of factors. Among these are the cause of the
visual loss, the extent of loss of visual acuity, the quality of
peripheral vision, and any other physical or mental limitations that
might affect use of a computer. What follows is a general description of the
major types of technology available to the blind or low-vision computer
user.  

<P>Screen reading programs usually consist of two parts: a software
program and a speech synthesizer. The software program, working as an
overlay between a popular off-the-shelf application program and the
disabled user, directs keyboard input to the speech synthesizer.  

<P>The speech synthesizer typically attaches to a computer's RS232C port and
converts standard ASCII text into speech. The synthetic speech can be
directed to headphones, so that it does not disturb others. The user
has the option of controlling the output of the speech synthesizer in
several ways; for example, the rate of speech produced may be
adjusted, or the output may be read character-by-character, or
line-by-line. When spelling out words or numbers, the synthesizer can
often be set to pronounce all spaces and punctuation marks as well. For example, 
a capital letter might be read with altered pitch. The aesthetic quality of synthetic speech varies greatly, ranging from the metallic quality of cheaper synthesizers to almost life-like voices.

<P>Large print screen displays are created in one of two ways: stand-alone
software programs, or hardware- and software-based magnification
systems. Stand-alone software magnification programs enlarge the normal text display of other application programs.  
 
<P>Screen magnifying systems employ both hardware and software adaptations to magnify the screen display. Typically, users can customize the magnification to their own preference. Other options include the ability to invert the screen display to show dark letters on a light background, since many people find the reverse display reduces eyestrain.

<P>Braille computer systems allow users to access the screen display in
Braille one line at a time. The user types input from a keyboard. Fitting between the user and the keyboard is a hardware device that accepts input from the keyboard, and translates it line-by-line into a tactile Braille display for the blind user. The Braille-based computer system is especially useful to those who work with large amounts of data. Pocket Braille computers contain both speech synthesizer and
Braille keyboard. They are used as portable note takers, address
books, calculators and clocks.  

<P>Braille software translators and embossers enable users to print
high-quality Braille documents from a PC. The software converts the screen display to Braille before it is sent to the Braille embosser to be printed. Reading systems perform optical character recognition to convert printed text into speech or computer files. The machines are limited to reading printed material only; handwriting and most newspapers are often indecipherable. 

<P><B><A NAME="mobile">Mobility Impairments</A></B>
<P>
Many adaptations are available to assist those with impaired mobility
use the computer. Although a standard keyboard and mouse are the input
devices of choice for most people, other devices have been developed. Among the most frequently used are modified and alternate keyboards,
ability switches, and headpointers and joysticks. These methods are
used in many variations and combinations, based on the abilities and
needs of the mobility-impaired user. Whatever the method, the computer
treats the input from these methods as if it had been received through
the standard keyboard.

<P>Modified keyboards include some relatively simple assistive
technologies designed to decrease the number of typing errors, and thus
increase productivity of those with impaired mobility. Descriptions of
three of these follow.
<UL><LI>The keyguard is a lightweight overlay, often plastic, that fits over the regular keyboard; holes are punched out of the plastic so that each standard key can be pressed if chosen deliberately, either with the fingers or mouthstick. The keyguard cuts down on accidental keystrokes substantially.
<LI>Permanent large print key labels can be placed on each character, number and punctuation mark of the standard keyboard. The visually impaired user may benefit from this adaptation, as do children.
<LI>Software exists that will disable the automatic-repeat feature of most keys on the PC keyboard.</UL>

<P>Alternate keyboards come in many styles. The keyboards consist of a
series of membrane switches arranged for ease of use. Some alternate
keyboard designs keep the standard QWERTY keyboard arrangement, but
omit numbers and enlarge the letter keys. Users who input only numeric
data may opt for a keyboard consisting entirely of enlarged numbers. Other keyboards are arranged so that the most frequently used
characters and numbers are in a central position. Miniature keyboards
are available for those with good pointing skills within a limited
area. Many alternate keyboards require a separate hardware interface
unit between the keyboard and the serial port, although the trend is
toward alternate keyboards capable of direct attachment to the keyboard
port.  

<P>Ability switches provide access to the screen display without using a
keyboard. Optimum use of ability switches requires careful assessment
of the user’s best voluntary function. The switches can be mounted
mechanically to wheelchairs, desks or almost anywhere else the user
might need the switch positioned. Switch mounting systems often
consist of adjustable arms attached to clamps and allow many users who
have severe motor disabilities to use a computer. A switch interface
unit acts as the link between the switch and the computer.

<P>Due to the wide variety of user abilities, many types of switches are
available. Switches exist that can be activated by only a raised
eyebrow, if that is the user’s most reliable movement. Ability
switches can provide feedback for users who require it. This feedback
often occurs in the form of an audible click upon activation. 
Commonly-used switches include the following:
<UL>
<LI>Button switch. 
<LI>Plate switch. 
<LI>Infrared switch. 
<LI>Sound-activated switch. 
<LI>Treadle switch -- for those with arm, elbow, foot or knee control. 
<LI>Pillow switch -- a soft, fabric-covered switch often used when activation is by a facial movement. 
<LI>Sip-and-puff switch -- controlled by voluntary inhaling and exhaling, frequently used by those with spinal cord injuries.  
<LI>Eyeglass switch -- activated by a purposeful eye movement. 
<LI>Arm slot control switch -- for those without fine motor control. Shifting the arm among the five arm slots activates switches that reproduce joystick or mouse control.
</UL>

<P>Operating a computer with switches involves learning one of two
techniques:
<OL><LI>With scanning, the cursor moves repeatedly from one character, or group of characters, to the next, often in a clockwise or counterclockwise motion. The user selects desired characters or words from the computer display by activating the switch when the cursor falls on that character or word. 
<P><LI>With direct selection methods, the user points to target items with a headpointer, mouthstick or joystick. Pointing devices allow users who have at least one voluntary, functional movement access to the computer. </UL>

<P><B><A NAME="speech">Speech, Language and Learning Impairments</A></B>

<P>Online computer instruction is a particularly good medium for intensive
remedial training. The strengths of the computer in education include
its capacity for constant, individual feedback to the student along
with an unlimited ability to carry out drill and practice exercises
until a subject is mastered.

<P>Computer packages have been designed to improve the speech and language
capabilities of those with poor hearing and speech, and also to assist
those with cognitive injuries or learning disabilities. Among the
current adaptations are vehicles for speech therapy and word
prediction software programs.

<P>Some software increases the efficiency of speech therapy by
synchronizing audio playback with interactive graphic displays of the
user’s speech. For example, the hearing- or speech-impaired user speaks into a
microphone, and if, for instance, loudness is the attribute being
measured, an on-screen balloon inflates as she or he speaks at the
desired level.

<P>Word prediction software programs are beneficial not only to the
learning disabled, but also to users with mobility impairments. The
programs operate in a way similar to the spelling check feature found
in many word processing programs: as the user types the first letters
of a word, the word prediction program compares it to a dictionary of
words that begin with those same letters. A window appears on-screen
with the list of words; if the user finds his or her intended word in the
list, one keystroke is all it takes to insert the word into a document. If not, the user can continue typing until the program presents the
correct match. Proper names and terms not included in the software
can be added to the program's dictionary for future use. For those
with mobility impairments, the saving in keystrokes adds greatly to
their productivity. Dyslexic students also benefit from the word
prediction programs.  

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG><A NAME="conk">Conclusion</A></STRONG></FONT>

<P>No doubt the scope of assistive technology for the disabled computer
user will enlarge in the future.  New opportunities for the disabled
student in higher education will naturally lead to increased
assimilation into the work force upon graduation.  Assistive technology
for disabled computer users supports the precept behind the Americans
with Disabilities Act -- that the disabled should have equal access to
all opportunities.

<H3>What is MathKit?</H3>
<P>MathKit is a mathematical software construction set that extends ToolBook.  For example, MathKit:
<UL>
<LI>Includes a comprehensive set of mathematical objects and functions that is seamlessly integrated into the ToolBook environment.
<LI>Provides symbolic and numeric computation, statistical data manipulation, near-typeset quality formula display, sophisticated display objects for 2D and 3D graphing with integrated animation.
<LI>Includes a full LOGO implementation for geometric explorations.
<LI>Allows users to do mathematics by using an English-like scripting language, MathScript, eliminating the need for learning a complicated formal programming language.
<LI>Allows its objects to be customized by the author by setting the MathKit object's properties. 
<LI>Contains special DataWindows for data analysis.
</UL>

<P>MathKit for ToolBook will be distributed in the following ways:
<UL>
<LI>Licensed to application developers.
<LI>Provided as a tool to content developers participating in the development of interactive mathematics curriculum materials coordinated by the IAT and funded by Foundations, etc.
<LI>Included as part of custom content development undertaken by the IAT for other parties. </UL>

<P>The IAT has no plans at this time to release an end-user retail version of MathKit for ToolBook.<P>

		<FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>tories and statistics from the first three months of Tennessee&#39;s welfare reform plan are a mix of good and bad news, as expected from a program aiming to move 91,500 families from welfare to work.
<P>   Families First began Sept. 1.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think we&#39;re seeing some real progress and some real success stories,&#39;&#39; said Vivian Stidham, district program supervisor for the Department of Human Services in Knoxville.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It is definitely not perfect. We&#39;ve got a great number of things to work out. It&#39;s the most complex thing we&#39;ve done or thought about doing, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d find anyone in this office who doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s the most important thing we&#39;ve ever done.&#39;&#39;
<P>   About 49,400 welfare recipients statewide met with DHS case managers in the first three months of the program to decide whether to take part in Families First. About 83.3 percent -- 41,155 -- enrolled, according to a quarterly report filed by DHS with state legislators and distributed last week.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think that it basically says that once time is taken by our case managers and our customers to fully explain the program, that the customers are opting in,&#39;&#39; DHS spokeswoman Patricia Harris-Morehead said.
<P>   Statewide, there were about 91,500 families getting Aid to Families with Dependent Children when Families First took effect. AFDC is the monthly cash payment commonly known as &#39;&#39;welfare.&#39;&#39; A mother with two children in Tennessee can get a $185 monthly check.
<P>   To keep the check, Tennessee families must enter Families First, a plan that requires them to sign a Personal Responsiblity Plan (PRP) showing how they&#39;ll move from welfare to work.
<P>   They must spend 40 hours a week at work or in a combination of work and training. After 18 months, their check stops. While they can reapply, there&#39;s a five-year lifetime cap.
<P>   Of the 41,155 who decided to enroll, DHS reported about one in five -- 8,300 people -- went to work either full- or part-time.
<P>   &#39;&#39;A lot of the jobs that are being secured early on are jobs that have been advertised in the local papers,&#39;&#39; said Glenda Shearon, DHS state director of cash assistance and food stamps.
<P>   Many are in service industries, at fast-food restaurants and hotels, for instance. Some got jobs after finishing training programs.
<P>   Almost 2,700 people -- 6.5 percent of those who signed PRPs -- were referred to training programs, which require part-time work. More than 8,600 families (21 percent) were referred to formalized job search activities, and more than 6,800 (16.6 percent) were referred to a life-skills training program called Fresh Start or to an adult education program.
<P>   DHS gave several reasons that almost 8,300 recipients didn&#39;t sign PRPs in the first three months of Familiies First.
<P>   About 3,100 cases were closed because people started earning too much money to qualify for welfare, although they can continue to get transitional benefits including child care, TennCare and food stamps.
<P>   Another 3,100 cases were closed &#39;&#39;voluntarily&#39;&#39; -- often due to missed appointments. The University of Memphis is conducting in-depth surveys this month to find out why people didn&#39;t participate.
<P>   Almost 2,100 people refused to sign PRPs, which automatically closed their welfare cases. In addition, 1,200 people who signed a PRP but didn&#39;t follow it were cut off of Families First.
<P>   Welfare advocates say challenges remain.
<P>   Lynne Williams, a Knoxville welfare mother who works in the federal Volunteers in Service to America program, said transportation and child care are needed.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The transportation system in Knoxville isn&#39;t that great because of the times in the morning the buses start and the times in the evening they end,&#39;&#39; Williams said. &#39;&#39;Services are limited on Saturdays, and there&#39;s no Sunday service. People&#39;s jobs go on beyond the hours that the buses run during the week.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The same issue relates to child care for those working night shifts at supermarkets or restaurants.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There&#39;s not a lot of 24-hour child care,&#39;&#39; Williams said. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s no sick care available, and there&#39;s not a whole lot of weekend care available. Those things are very hard.&#39;&#39;
<P>   DHS officials acknowledged at the outset that the program will evolve as problems surface. Stidham said the state has allowed flexibility.
<P>   For instance, Families First&#39;s 40-hour work/school requirement didn&#39;t count study time for college or nursing school students.
<P>   &#39;&#39;In counting their 40 hours, we could only count the hours they were in class or lab,&#39;&#39; Stidham said. The state decided to credit one hour of study time for every hour in class that requires outside study. &#39;&#39;It was a big issue for students,&#39;&#39; she said.
<P>   The state also has approved six more case manager specialists, who assist case managers, for Knoxville, she said.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The biggest challenge we&#39;re facing in our office is the workload, the volume,&#39;&#39; Stidham said. &#39;&#39;We know what needs to be done, and we simply have not had enough time. . . . Case managers have not been able to give the personal attention they want to give.&#39;&#39;
<P>   She said caseloads average around 170 cases per manager.
<P>   Still, she said, &#39;&#39;As difficult as it&#39;s been, because the workload&#39;s been heavy, this is the first time you can say the whole program is geared toward something that has the definite potential to make a difference in somebody&#39;s life.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Before, we have fostered dependency. We have given our benefits without requiring responsibility in return.&#39;&#39;

        Bird snared after 2-hour chase in West Knoxville</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Randy Kenner, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>ommy Prince conceded he's ''no
        Stan Brock,'' but Monday afternoon, Prince did his best
        imitation of the ''Wild Kingdom'' star as he and others
        chased down a young rhea in the wilds of West Knoxville. </p>
        <p>''It was a circuitous route, maybe three (miles),
        maybe half a mile as the crow flies,'' the Knox County
        school board member later joked. </p>
        <p>The rhea, a tall South American bird that resembles
        the African ostrich but is smaller, was finally hemmed in
        and captured by Alcoa schoolteacher Sharon Howard after a
        nearly two-hour chase that started in the Suburban Hills
        subdivision and ended just off Gleason Road. In between,
        the rhea made jaunts through the Concepts 21 apartments
        complex parking lot, the area around Gallaher Memorial
        Baptist Church and down Gallaher View Road. </p>
        <p>''He got in a thicket and when he got tangled up, I
        grabbed him and just hung on,'' Howard said of the
        stong-legged bird. ''It took everything I had to hold
        him.'' </p>
        <p>Howard and her husband, Ronnie, carried the apparently
        uninjured but somewhat tired animal to the University of
        Tennessee Veterinary Hospital in the back of their
        pickup. </p>
        <p>Sharon Howard, who rode in the bed of the truck with
        the rhea, said it occasionally lifted its head over the
        tailgate to look around during the trip. </p>
        <p>''We'd be driving along, and someone would pull up to
        pass us and . . . they'd do a double take,'' she said. </p>
        <p>The bird was still at UT Monday evening. Its owner had
        called the school looking for the rhea after discovering
        it was missing but had not yet arrived to retrieve it. </p>
        <p>According to Prince, the chase started just after noon
        Monday while he was working in his backyard and heard
        what sounded like footsteps coming through a wooded area
        being his house. He looked up, expecting to see a person.
        He saw something else instead. </p>
        <p>''I looked up and (thought) it was an emu or an
        ostrich,'' Prince said. </p>
        <p>Concerned the animal might get hit by a car, Prince
        enlisted the help of his three children, Rollin, Nathan
        and Merry Katherine, to help corral the bird. Neighbor
        Joe Goeltz also became involved in the chase. </p>
        <p>It proved to be harder than expected because the
        flightless bird turned out to be a fleet-footed runner. </p>
        <p>''Oh yeah, it's amazing how it could (run),'' Prince
        said. </p>
        <p>The Howards and their two sons, Jason and Chris,
        joined the pursuit when the bird ran out in front of them
        on Gleason Road. </p>
        <p>''We saw him and there were some kids from the
        neighborhood chasing him,'' Sharon Howard of Maryville
        said. ''I was afraid he was going to get hit by a car''
        or that dogs might get him. </p>
        <p>The bird was cornered two or three times, according to
        Prince, but somehow managed to elude its pursuers. </p>
        <p>''It seemed like forever,'' Howard said of the chase. </p>
        <p>She said she had caught animals before but ''never
        something this big.'' </p>
        <p>Prince said the rhea was calm after it was finally
        caught. </p>
        <p>''It was worn out, bless its heart,'' Prince said.
        ''And so was I.'' </p>

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">W</FONT>ith a day off from classes, University of Tennessee student Jonathan Brown spent Monday marching to commemorate the most famous of civil rights marchers -- Martin Luther King Jr.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That&#39;s the least we can do,&#39;&#39; said Brown, a junior defensive end on the UT football team.
<P>   Brown was joined by nearly 200 other students and UT staffers in marching across campus Monday -- inauguration day for President Clinton but also the official MLK holiday.
<P>   The multiracial marchers held candles as they moved silently from the Torchbearer statue in Circle Park down Volunteer Boulevard to the University Center, where they were treated to a two-hour program of skits, singing, dancing and impassioned speeches.
<P>   A big banner bore the march&#39;s theme: &#39;&#39;There is no progress without struggle.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The event was sponsored by the Black Cultural Programming Committee, a student group that, aside from the annual march, brings speakers and entertainers to campus.
<P>   Student marchers said remembering King is vital to pushing his dream of racial harmony and justice.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;m hoping this march is a step toward realizing Dr. King&#39;s dream -- a cultural celebration, racial understanding and brotherhood, or actually brother and sisterhood,&#39;&#39; said Kathy Kaplan, a 19-year-old sports broadcasting major at UT.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think Dr. King was the great American hero,&#39;&#39; said Paul Weathers, a 22-year-old also majoring in broadcasting. &#39;&#39;I&#39;d rather be doing this than watching the inauguration on TV, watching a bunch of white liberals taking all the credit for what he did.&#39;&#39;
<P>   March coordinator Darnell Reid, speaking over a bullhorn, told marchers to &#39;&#39;imagine the hostility and pain&#39;&#39; marchers endured during the height of the civil rights movement.
<P>   In the University Center auditorium, marchers heard spirited songs by the Love United Gospel Choir, a student singing group, and racially charged skits by student actors in FOCUS -- Finding Our Common Understandings and Strengths. The skits were a raw display of bigotry -- against blacks, against gays, against foreigners, against overweight people -- to demonstrate the absurdity of prejudice.
<P>   A Carter High School student, Syreeta Dickerson, 16, also read her winning essay, &#39;&#39;The Impact of My Success in the Strawberry Plains Community.&#39;&#39; The paper told of her struggle for acceptance as the first black drum major at the predominantly white school.
<P>   Keynote speaker for Monday&#39;s event was Faye Harrison, associate professor of anthropology at UT. Harrison, saying her remarks were aimed mainly at &#39;&#39;members of the hip-hop and X generations,&#39;&#39; said global economic changes -- the displacement of jobs by technology, for example, and corporate exploitation of cheap labor -- do not bode well for the world&#39;s underclasses, including American blacks.
<P>   King, she said, progressed from the political goal of integration to the bigger goal of fundamental social change, including economic justice for all.

<!--SUBHEAD-->        </p>
        
        
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Duncan Mansfield, Associated
        Press</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>daho retiree Chris Hoobs has been
        hooked on Home &amp; Garden Television ever since it went
        on the air in December 1994. He is not alone. </p>
        <p>An avid woodworker and home remodeler, Hoobs wrote the
        Knoxville-based cable network that he and his wife ''feel
        like kids in a candy shop'' tuning in at home in Emmett,
        some 30 miles from Boise. </p>
        <p>''We don't feel that way any more,'' he says today,
        chuckling. ''It's gotten better.'' </p>
        <p>Barely two years since its launch, HGTV is being
        hailed by media analysts as ''one of the most promising
        cable networks'' in recent years. </p>
        <p>Quality programming, strong advertiser support and
        ''an attractive niche in a pretty crowded marketplace''
        are just some of the reasons, says Kevin Kupinski of A.G.
        Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. </p>
        <p>Home &amp; Garden's subscriber base has nearly
        quadrupled in two years to 22 million homes -- nearly one
        out of every three cable homes in the country -- with
        commitments for 6 million more. </p>
        <p>''We have not seen networks of that size fail,
        historically,'' says Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with
        Paul Kagan Associates Inc. in California, who considers
        expansion of cable system access a top priority for new
        networks. </p>
        <p>The network devoted to ''everything you love about
        home'' is pushing into the major markets of Chicago, New
        York and Los Angeles. Late this year, it will become 24
        hours a day in Canada. Deals for Europe and Australia
        aren't far off. </p>
        <p>''They have earned the distribution they are
        getting,'' says Mike Smith, spokesman for Colorado-based
        Tele-Communications Inc., which in December began
        aggressively promoting HGTV to its local system
        operators. </p>
        <p>TCI, the nation's largest cable company with 14
        million subscribers, is impressed that HGTV has spent a
        lot of time and money ''creating a vision and following
        that vision with original programming,'' Smith says. </p>
        <p>HGTV's list of national advertisers has grown from 40
        to nearly 700. While do-it-yourselfer chains like Lowe's
        and Home Depot and their product manufacturers dominate,
        the Big Three automakers are among those finding HGTV a
        place to be. </p>
        <p>The response from viewers continues to astonish even
        HGTV executives. One recent Saturday morning, the network
        aired its first viewer call-in show, hosted by weatherman
        and HGTV wine connoisseur Spencer Christian. HGTV experts
        took questions on everything from gardening to interior
        decorating, building to rebuilding. </p>
        <p>''We purposely didn't promote it at all,'' says Ken
        Lowe, HGTV founder, president and CEO. ''We wanted to
        make sure, since this was our first one, 'let's get it
        right.' It was almost like a dress rehearsal.'' </p>
        <p>The response? Ten thousand calls in two hours. </p>
        <p>''It was spectacular. We were truly overwhelmed,''
        Lowe says. </p>
        <p>In addition, HGTV broadcast its Internet address
        (http://www.hgtv.com) for the first time. The network's
        file server jammed with 50,000 e-mail queries from 47
        states. </p>
        <p>Lowe recalls it wasn't so long ago that he was
        peddling his concept for Home &amp; Garden Television on
        fraying poster boards to his bosses at E.W. Scripps Co.
        in Cincinnati. Scripps' holdings include nine television
        stations and daily newspapers in 16 markets, including
        The Knoxville News-Sentinel. </p>
        <p>''As Ken began to outline this idea and as we
        talked,'' Scripps senior vice president Frank Gardner
        says, ''it was clear . . . this was not some spur of the
        moment notion that he had had, but this was the product
        of several years' worth of very meticulous thought.'' </p>
        <p>Scripps gave the OK. It bought an established cable
        programming studio in Knoxville, Cinetel Productions, and
        built HGTV's new headquarters next door. It found
        executive talent from the ranks of established networks,
        such as HBO, NBC and E! And it committed $50 million to
        the project, then upped it to $75 million. </p>
        <p>Lowe and Susan Packard, HGTV's chief operating
        officer, say the network is on course to begin showing a
        profit in its fourth year. </p>
        <p>Unusual for cable television, this has been
        accomplished: </p>
        <p>Without selling off pieces to cable operators, as
        Turner Broadcasting did. </p>
        <p>Without paying for new subscribers. Rubert Murdoch
        reportedly offered $12 a subscriber for the Fox News
        Channel. </p>
        <p>Without requiring HGTV hosts use advertiser products. </p>
        <p>Without filling the schedule with reruns. Eighty
        percent of HGTV's content is original; 100 percent during
        prime time. </p>
        <p>''It really is sort of a Cinderella story,'' Packard
        says. ''Now we are at a point where we are maturing,
        where (the industry) is putting us in a completely
        different category. You know, we are now one of the
        players.'' </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>Planned lawsuit protests Farragut zoning</B></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Builders' group, landowners claim less affluent are hurt</FONT><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Bob Womack, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">Z</FONT>oning regulations in Farragut violate property rights granted by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Tennessee Valley Home Builders Association alleges in a lawsuit expected to be filed in Knox County Chancery Court today.
<P>   Mike Carlton, president of the organization, says the laws are a deliberate attempt by the town to keep less affluent people from living in Farragut.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They have planned a community only for the affluent,&#39;&#39; Carlton said Monday in explaining the reasons behind the pending filing of the suit.
<P>   &#39;&#39;By the time you meet all the regulations, there is no way you can have the number of units (the regulations) allow.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Carlton said the average cost of a house throughout Knox County is about $107,000. In Farragut, the average cost is &#39;&#39;well over 220,000,&#39;&#39; he said.
<P>   He said zoning ordinances adopted last year and another new ordinance about to be approved that regulate development of single-family homes on small lots, of condominiums, of townhouses and of apartments do not help the situation.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They tell you, &#39;We are giving you small lots and apartments,&#39; but the large print giveth and the small print taketh away,&#39;&#39; Carlton said.
<P>   The home builders are being joined in the suit by several property owners in Farragut who claim regulations have prevented them from developing a 7-acre tract they own on Kingston Pike. They are Cecil L. and Betty V. Byrd, James R. &#39;&#39;Buddy&#39;&#39; White, White Family Ltd. and White Family Partnerships.
<P>   According to the suit to be filed, they allege they submitted an application to the town in August 1996 to rezone the property for development of multifamily housing, such as apartments or condominiums. They said the town returned the application and advised them there was no such zoning as they had requested.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Thus, the property owners were deprived of the use of their property and the anticipated profits that would flow from a reasonable development of the property,&#39;&#39; the suit alleges.
<P>   The plaintiffs also said the housing was intended for &#39;&#39;the elderly, handicapped and low-income citizens who have been deprived of adequate housing within the town of Farragut.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The suit also contends the ordinances require developers to set aside a certain amount of property for buffer strips, setbacks and slope requirements. Furthermore, they must set aside land for community open space for recreational purposes and provide bicycle paths.
<P>   &#39;&#39;All of (these) are designed to discourage residential development and residential building. There is no rational basis between these ordinances and the governmental interests they seek to address,&#39;&#39; the suit contends.
<P>   It alleges the effect of the regulations is to &#39;&#39;price the land and dwelling unit out of the market.&#39;&#39;   The regulations have the effect of taking property without just compensation, the suit alleges.
<P>   The plaintiffs will ask the court to strike down the ordinances and declare that the town is not operating legally because it does not provide police and fire services, a school system, and &#39;&#39;many of the usual municipal services&#39;&#39; that other governmental entities provide.

        <font size="5">C</font>ooks came bearing cookies --
        chocolate, of course. </p>
        <p>The occasion was a cookie contest last Wednesday as a
        preview to the 11th annual Chocolate Fest. </p>
        <p>Chocolate Fest will be Saturday, Jan. 18, 10 a.m. to 4
        p.m., on both levels of East Towne Mall, regardless of
        weather. </p>
        <p>Thirty contestants brought cookies to East Towne last
        week for tasting by judges. </p>
        <p>Winners were Barbara Tenney, first place, with gourmet
        mint brownies; six-year-old Peter Shankles, second with
        cartwheels, and Teresa Lee, third with chocolate
        chippers. </p>
        <p>The Shankles family delighted contestants and others
        who stopped by Center Court at the mall to peek at the
        cookies displayed on a table. </p>
        <p>Besides Peter, his brothers, Stevie, 10, and Andrew,
        8, had entries. Mom Karen Shankles was there with the two
        other children, Molly, 4, and Jonathan, 2. She and the
        kids made the cookies together, and the boys entered the
        cookie they named. Peter named the chocolately-pecan
        cartwheels. </p>
        <p>White Lily Foods Co. was co-sponsor of the cookie
        contest, and Belinda Ellis, White Lily consumer service
        manager, judged the contest along with Walter Lambert,
        The News-Sentinel restaurant reviewer and Channel 8
        television chef; Bonnie Sheeley, Knox County agricultural
        extension service, and Ellis Bacon, owner of the South's
        Finest Chocolate Factory. Bacon has been a participant in
        Chocolate Fest since its beginning. </p>
        <p>New to Chocolate Fest this year will be a cafe for
        ''private dining'' at Center Court in the mall. Cookie
        contest winners, judges and event sponsors received
        tickets to Chocolate Fest and an invitation to dine at
        the new cafe on samples from participating chocolatiers. </p>
        <p>Thirty-one area chocolatiers will participate with
        delectables like fudge, cheesecake, ice creams, coffee,
        mousse, cake, candies and more. Those attending are
        encouraged to bring along a container to take samples
        they can't eat on the site home with them.<b> </b>Containers
        also will be available for purchase at the fest. </p>
        <p>Entertainment is planned during the day for adults and
        children at the family-oriented event. </p>
        <p>Cost is $10 and tickets will be available at the
        registration desk at East Towne Saturday. Proceeds
        benefit the National Kidney Foundation of East Tennessee.
        For information on purchasing tickets before the event,
        call 688-5481. </p>

        <p>In large saucepan, melt margarine and chocolate over
        very low heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat;
        cool slightly. Stir in sugar and vanilla. Add 4 eggs, one
        at a time, beating well after each addition. </p>
        <p>Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off.
        Stir flour into chocolate mixture; mix well. Spread in

        purchases boxes of Domino brand superfine sugar at Food
        Lion. </p>
        <p>Whip egg white until foamy using a fork. Use a small
        brush and brush the egg white on the top and bottom of
        mint leaves and violets. Place on a piece of wax paper
        and sprinkle superfine sugar on leaves and violets using
        a flour sifter or salt shaker. Let them dry at room
        temperature. Store in airtight container for three or
        four days. </p>

        butter flavorings and pudding mix. Beat until smooth and
        creamy. Beat in eggs. Gradually add flour mixture. Stir
        in chocolate morsels and chopped pecans. </p>
        <p>Drop by tablespoonsful about 2 inches apart on lightly
        greased baking sheet. Press pecan halves into the sides
        of each cookie so they stick out from the dough like
        spokes from the center of a wheel. </p>
        <p>Bake at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes or until dough is set
        and only very slightly browned. </p>
        <p>Cool on pan 2 to 3 minutes before removing cookies to
        a wire rack to finish cooling. </p>
        <p>Melt candy coating in microwave safe dish, according
        to package directions. Drizzle melted chocolate coating
        over cooled cookies, leaving pecan halves exposed. </p>
        <p>Store in airtight container. </p>
        <p>Yield: 4 dozen cookies. </p>
        <p>Note: The chocolate flavored bark or candy coating is
        available at Kroger's. </p>

<BASEFONT SIZE="6"><FONT SIZE="6"><B>New arrivals have a stabilizing effect</B></FONT><BR><!--SUBHEAD--><P>
</basefont><FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><!--dateline--></FONT></B><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+2">M</FONT>OORESVILLE, N.C. -- The Sophomore Blues are no more for the Michael Kranefuss/Carl Haas Winston Cup team owners.
<P>   The arrival of driver Jeremy Mayfield in October and crew chief Paul Andrews three months later, appears to have stabilized the Ford team to the point. Kranefuss said, &#39;&#39;I firmly believe we can forget the 1996 season.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Kranefuss pulled off a swap with Cale Yarborough, another Ford owner, getting Mayfield for John Andretti. Then Tim Brewer, who ranks second in career victories for a crew chief, departed. The moves were like winning a chess match.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think the changes will pay off this season,&#39;&#39; Kranefuss said. &#39;&#39;Paul was the first crew chief I went to after Brewer and I separated. With Paul&#39;s stablizing force, Jeremy and the young guys have a good future.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Afer showing flashes of promise in 1995, Mayfield, 27, had other offers but it was Kranefuss&#39; choice from the start.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Where we are (starting the 1997 season) is high for this team. Everything is going better than I had thought,&#39;&#39; Mayfield said. &#39;&#39;We had a pretty good situation going when we got the ball going. It would have been hard to make it different.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Andrews also had the right credentials which included the 1992 Winston Cup championship for the late Alan Kulwicki. He spent five years and five races with Kulwicki, who died in a plane clash while approaching Tri-City Airport less than three miles from Bristol Motor Speedway. Andrews remained with the team through the 1996 season.
<P>   &#39;&#39;New faces and new drivers give you a real good feeling,&#39;&#39; Andrews said. &#39;&#39;The transition for me has been easy. There are a lot of good people on this team and you don&#39;t take charge over night. It has been a good job getting ready for Daytona.
<P>   
<P>   Kranefuss said, &#39;&#39;I watched Mayfield, saw a lot of things that were like Rusty (Wallace). I knew it would take a while to adjust to a different team. You can&#39;t buy wins. You&#39;ve got to be able to buy drivers with the right information.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Mayfield finished 34th in points last season and shoots for a 15th position this year.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I had to run hard and learn a lot in 1994 after I went to Cale. He was my hero when he was winning championships,&#39;&#39; Mayfield said. &#39;&#39;I had to work hard to get in with a race team when I started (1993).
<P>   &#39;&#39;Preparation for a season is a big cost so I stay out of the shop and let the crew do what they can. We work together and hope to put a good team together. I want to give them something to work with and they will try to do the same for me.&#39;&#39;
<P>   While with Kulwicki, Andrews produced five victories, two of those during the championship season. That was a huge plus when Geoff Bodine purchased the team nearly seven months after Kulwicki&#39;s death.
<P>   &#39;&#39;When we won the title in 1992, the problem was being one of the least financed teams,&#39;&#39; Andrews said. &#39;&#39;It would be hard to swallow it now. The quickest thing to do (reduce costs) is to be in the top 15 in points after the first four races. The most important thing is to start each race.&#39;&#39;

<P>   Florida Citrus Bowl hoopla will shift into high gear on Wednesday, Jan. 1, in Orlando. The New Year&#39;s Day football game between the University of Tennessee and Northwestern University is set for 1 p.m.
<P>   Five days of pre-game activities bring out fans in big numbers. The team is staying at the Renaissance Orlando Resort. President and Mrs. Joe Johnson will be there too.
<P>   The midweek game date presents travel problems for some. People are flying in and flying out in order to get children back for school&#39;s opening on Jan. 2.
<P>    That&#39;s the plan for Mike Moneymaker of Farragut.  He&#39;s taking his daughter, Brandi, 13, and her friend, Haley McCabe, 13.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve missed a bowl game since the 1967-68 season,&#39;&#39; says Moneymaker.  He and his wife, Vickie, are UT graduates and big fans.  About 40 friends from Tennessee, Texas and Georgia meet Moneymaker at the bowl games every year.  
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;d rather be there in person than watch it on TV.  I get more out of the game,&#39;&#39; Moneymaker says. He counts this as his seventh trip to Orlando. The family usually takes in all the tourist sites. This year they hope to get to Busch Gardens in Tampa.
<P>Disney fun facts
<P>   If you think University of Tennessee fans are decked out in Big Orange for the Citrus Bowl, then think again when you stroll through Walt Disney World Resort.  The Disney folks really know how to get dressed up!
<P>   It takes about 130 tractor-trailer truckloads to transport all the holiday decorations from the Christmas warehouse to locations throughout Walt Disney World.
<P>   More than 80,000 red, white and pink poinsettias fill flower beds throughout Disney World. 
<P>   Eighteen thousand apples are hung throughout Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground to adorn the resort&#39;s country-themed holiday celebration.
<P>   Four hundred Christmas trees are decorated throughout the Vacation Kingdom.
<P>   More than 14 miles of garland are strung throughout the resort.
<P>Fla. inn directory available
<P>   Visitors to Florida may want to stay at bed and breakfast inns, Southern mansions or small oceanfront resorts. To help them find a place to fit their needs, the Florida Association of Small and Historic Lodging Properties has published a directory.  
<P>   The guidebook describes the inns&#39; unique qualities and maps out locations. It lists 110 properties across the state. To request a copy of &#39;&#39;Inns of Florida,&#39;&#39; call 800 524-1880.
<P>Beaches beckon football fans
<P>   Florida&#39;s Space Coast, just 35 miles east of Orlando, is a perfect destination for vacationers with beach dreams.  
<P>   It is the home of NASA Kennedy Space Center, world-renowned Ron Jon Surf Shop and the largest sea turtle nesting area in the country. Here surfers tame water tunnels, history buffs visit famous sites, art lovers browse through galleries and aviation enthusiasts watch the skies. 
<P>   This 72-mile stretch of Atlantic shore offers affordable family accommodations. To reach Florida&#39;s Space Coast Office of Tourism, call 800 USA-1969.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">C</FONT>HATTANOOGA -- Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, the country&#39;s most expensive, has received favorable marks in its first major review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<P>    That was good news to the Tennessee Valley Authority, which started Watts Bar&#39;s Unit 1 reactor in May after spending $7 billion and 23 years in construction.
<P>    &#39;&#39;In the first year of operation, Watts Bar has become a top performer in the nuclear industry,&#39;&#39; TVA Chairman Craven Crowell said Monday.
<P>    The NRC evaluation gave Watts Bar top marks for engineering and maintenance and &#39;&#39;good&#39;&#39; ratings for plant operations and plant support following a one-year review that began in November 1995.
<P>    Watts Bar&#39;s ratings from the NRC exceeded the average for all 110 nuclear reactors in the country and were among the most favorable of those for new plants.
<P>    &#39;&#39;An effective transition was made from construction phase to full unit operation,&#39;&#39; said Stewart Ebneter, regional administrator for the NRC in Atlanta. &#39;&#39;Management support and oversight of day-to-day operations have been excellent.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Construction problems made Watts Bar one of the nation&#39;s most watched nuclear plants and the most expensive. Concerns about equipment and design flaws forced TVA to spend 10 years modifying the plant&#39;s equipment to meet new NRC standards. TVA has since canceled plans to operate Watts Bar&#39;s Unit 2 reactor unless another company pays the bill.
<P>    But since June, Unit 1 has reached a capacity of 85 percent. That&#39;s far ahead of the industry average of 65 percent for first-year plants.
<P>    Unit 1 operated for 117 straight days until a scheduled outage this fall and has operated for 74 days continuously since then. Watts Bar has had no unscheduled stops since the original start-up.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Our challenge now is to improve on this excellent level of performance while maintaining our commitment to lead the industry in safety, reliability and competitiveness,&#39;&#39; Site Vice President John Scalice told The Chattanooga Times.
<P>    The NRC, which will detail its review Tuesday, Jan. 7, at the plant near Spring City, said Watts Bar workers carefully planned and handled the power start-up program this spring. The plant&#39;s only weaknesses were for configuration controls, attention to detail and some procedural problems.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT>tate auditors have agreed with what Knox County lawyers and school officials have said for months:
<P>   There&#39;s nothing illegal about hiring an out-of-state lawyer to represent the school system in special education cases, and despite legal expenses, special education funding has increased annually for several years.
<P>   Special education students range from those with minor learning disabilities to others with severe physical handicaps or behavioral problems.
<P>   The school system has retained Atlanta lawyer Charles Weatherly to help fight lawsuits that school officials said would force them to provide unnecessary and costly services.
<P>   Local lawyer Mark Jendrek has complained that $185,000 paid to Weatherly in fiscal 1994 and 1995 was improper. He made his argument ultimately to county commissioners, but school officials and the county Law Department said the spending was proper.
<P>   The Tennessee Department of Education&#39;s audit section agreed with local officials in a report issued Dec. 16. The school board received the report this week.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Based on interviews conducted with state personnel and tests of the accounting records, it appears the Knox County School System has not illegally or improperly budgeted funds for outside counsel and has not used federal funds to pay legal fees,&#39;&#39; the audit report states.
<P>   Chris Steppee, director of internal audit for the state Department of Education, said Weatherly was paid $154,600 in fiscal 1995 and $191,200 in fiscal 1996. State officials couldn&#39;t say Friday who filed the complaint that led to their audit. Jendrek said he didn&#39;t file it.
<P>   The audit examined whether:
<P>   * Funds for outside counsel were illegally and improperly budgeted. At issue was whether legal fees are properly budgeted for &#39;&#39;special education services.&#39;&#39; Auditors said budgeting was proper.
<P>   * Funds were spent on legal fees in lieu of special education services. &#39;&#39;We found that the system had consistently increased its spending each year for the Special Education Program,&#39;&#39; auditors said.
<P>   * Federal funds were used to pay legal fees. The audit found they weren&#39;t.
<P>   John McCook, director of pupil personnel for the school system, said he learned of the audit findings this week. &#39;&#39;We were happy,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;We didn&#39;t think we had done anything wrong.&#39;&#39;
<P>   School board Chairwoman Margaret Maddox said paying an expert lawyer to avoid unnecessary costs actually helps special education students.
<P>   &#39;&#39;If anything, we save money to put back in the program,&#39;&#39; Maddox said.

		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">R</FONT>esearchers are looking for three more black bears to complete a re-introduction project in the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area.
<P>   Dr. Joe Clark, director of the Southern Appalachian Field Laboratory for the National Biological Service, said the bears will compensate for ones that wandered off after being relocated last summer.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Right now we&#39;re locating them with telemetry so we&#39;ll know where they are when we move them in early March,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;By then, they&#39;ll still be hibernating and hopefully with cubs.&#39;&#39;
<P>   The three bears -- like all the bears used in the project -- will come from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Big South Fork project is an experimental reintroduction with a limit of 12 bears. Females are being used because they have smaller home ranges and are less likely to disperse than males.
<P>   The Big South Fork bear project began last winter with the capture of six female bears -- three of them pregnant and three with cubs. Once at Big South Fork, the bears were placed in dens to resume hibernation.
<P>   Last summer an additional six female bears were taken from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and released into a remote area of Big South Fork after spending two weeks in acclimating pens. Of the six summer-release bears, two stayed inside the 115,000-acre Big South Fork area.
<P>   Clark said the purpose of the study -- a cooperative effort between the National Biological Service, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the National Park Service, and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources -- is to test which technique, summer or winter, works best at minimizing the bears&#39; instinct to return home.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The distinction between the two seems clear,&#39;&#39; said Clark. &#39;&#39;The summer-release bears wandered around, and they had more mortalities.&#39;&#39;
<P>   To date, there are seven adult female black bears and a number of cubs in the Big South Fork as a result of the yearlong project. Clark said one of the summer bears has established a home range at Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.
<P>   Clark said that of the winter-released bears, the ones moved to Big South Fork with new cubs tend to stick to the area better than pregnant bears, which often wander around before re-denning for the rest of the winter.
<P>   A graduate student from the University of Tennessee is monitoring the bears&#39; movements every week. This winter he will check for cub survival, physical condition and denning preferences.
<P>   Black bears once roamed all over Kentucky and Tennessee, including the Big South Fork area, but were eliminated due to unregulated hunting and habitat destruction. Biologists say Big South Fork and surrounding woodlands, such as the Daniel Boone National Forest, offer a quarter-million acres of potential bear habitat.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Big South Fork has a much younger forest than the Smokies,&#39;&#39; said Clark. &#39;&#39;There are more roads, more openings. If we check the bears and find they&#39;re all skin and bones, we&#39;ll know they had a bad year.&#39;&#39;

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Morgan Simmons, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		</basefont><FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>efore making management decisions affecting old-growth forests in the South, the U.S. Forest Service wants answers to a few basic questions.
<P>    Like what is old growth and what isn&#39;t.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Our agency decided to go out to the researchers and scientists and ask them for a definition,&#39;&#39; said Sam Brocato, timber, wildlife and fisheries staff officer for the Cherokee National Forest. &#39;&#39;Once we adopt a set of old-growth criterion, then we can go to the field and inventory what we have.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The findings of the old-growth team are contained in a report titled &#39;&#39;Guidance for Conserving and Restoring Old Growth Forest Communities on the National Forests in the Southern Region.&#39;&#39; The report was published recently as a final draft and is out for public review.
<P>    The document -- a year in the making -- provides old-growth definitions for 16 vegetation types and also establishes procedures for identifying existing and future stands of old growth through field inventories.
<P>    A team of 10 professionals with backgrounds in forest ecology, silviculture, natural resources planning and public affairs contributed to the 100-page report, which addresses old growth in the national forests of all 13 Southern states and will be used in the Forest Service&#39;s upcoming forest-plan revisions for the Cherokee National Forest.
<P>    &#39;&#39;Old growth is a local issue as well as a national issue,&#39;&#39; said Brocato. &#39;&#39;Hopefully, this will provide some common ground for the general public and land managers to agree upon in planning for old growth in the Southeast.&#39;&#39;
<P>    According to the report, existing old-growth communities may represent aound 0.6 percent (approximately 676,000 acres) of the total forest acreage (approximately 108,400,000 acres) in the Southeast.
<P>    The report states that national forests should conserve old-growth communities by developing a network of old-growth restoration areas, leading to a &#39;&#39;forest matrix which includes a full array of forest conditions but which is dominated primarily by mid- and late-successional forests.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The report recognizes the need for public participation and coordination between national forests sharing common ecological boundaries and says: &#39;&#39;Due to the current scarcity of old-growth communities, most of the old-growth efforts on Southern national forests will involve identifying areas for old-growth restoration.&#39;&#39;
<P>    The report lists 16 old-growth communities (nine found in the Cherokee). Examples include Northern hardwood forest, Eastern river-front forest, dry-mesic oak forest, and dry and xeric oak forests, woodlands.
<P>    A set of old-growth parameters -- the mean age of the tree, diameter of the trunk and number of trees per acre -- are provided for each forest type. For example, with hardwood sugar maples, old growth is defined as trees between 100 and 136 years old and measuring between 14 and 38 inches in diameter 41/2 feet up the trunk. The stand density for sugar maples calls for a minimum of 153 old-growth trees per acre.
<P>    &#39;&#39;The old-growth attributes for one forest type may be entirely different for another,&#39;&#39; said Brocato. &#39;&#39;Similarly, our definition of old growth in the Southeast is nothing like what&#39;s used out West. Before we can address the issue of old growth, we have to understand which definitions to use. That first step is provided by this report.&#39;&#39;

<P>
<P>
<P>   NEWPORT -- A 25-year-old Cocke County woman was placed on a life-support system Monday following an early morning shooting, authorities said. The victim&#39;s boyfriend was charged with attempted first-degree murder.
<P>   April Hawthorne was shot in the forehead with a .22-caliber rifle about 2 a.m. Monday, Cocke County Sheriff&#39;s Department officials said. Her boyfriend and roommate, Ricky Williams, 25, is accused of shooting Hawthorne inside their home in the Point Pleasant community.
<P>   Williams told investigators he and Hawthorne argued Sunday before he left for a friend&#39;s house and an evening of drinking.
<P>   After returning home, Williams told authorities, he was &#39;&#39;(fooling) with the weapon&#39;&#39; when he fired three shots.
<P>   Investigators determined the third bullet passed through a blanket that was hanging in a doorway and struck the victim.
<P>   Williams was arraigned Monday by Cocke County General Sessions Judge Marcus Mooneyham, who set bond at $100,000 and told investigators the charge may be upgraded to first-degree murder if Hawthorne&#39;s injuries prove fatal.
<P>   Detective Robert Caldwell said Hawthorne is on a life-support system in the intensive care unit of Baptist Hospital of Cocke County.

<P><h3>Bid-opening scheduled for Interstate 24 ramp</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>    MURFREESBORO -- The state Department of Transportation plans to open bids March 21 on a new exit ramp off Interstate 24, said state Rep. Mary Ann Eckles.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s an interchange improvement for I-24 from Chattanooga and going to Outlets Ltd. Mall,&#39;&#39; said Eckles, D-Murfreesboro.
<P>    Currently, motorists who exit I-24 North and want to go to Franklin must make a left onto Old Fort Parkway.
<P>   &#39;&#39;There are cases when trucks pull out from the access ramp turning left toward Franklin and cause congestion,&#39;&#39; said Dana Richardson, Murfreesboro traffic director.
<P>    Richardson said the turn had caused several accidents over the years.

		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he nonprofit Southern Environmental Law Center of Charlottesville, Va., will join the debate over a pumped-storage hydropower facility proposed for the Sequatchie Valley.
<P>   The legal group&#39;s participation is contingent on project opponents&#39; ability to raise $1,000 to match the center&#39;s offer of a $3,000 legal-services challenge grant.
<P>   Lee W. Patten, an organizer of the Save Our Sequatchie landowners&#39; group, said the SELC&#39;s 12 lawyers have pledged to aid the SOS&#39;s legal opposition to the project development plan of Armstrong Energy Resources Inc. 
<P>   Before AER can build the huge hydropower plant, its plans must be approved by several government agencies, most notably TVA, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
<P>   AER, a firm based in Butler, Pa., late in December opted to defer the Reynolds Creek portion of the $4 billion hydropower plant. Its officials promised to continue seeking federal and state permits to build the project&#39;s larger Laurel Branch portion, which entails dams, lakes and a pumping power generation station in Bledsoe County near Dunlap. 
<P>   Excess TVA power, bought by AER during low demand periods, would be used to lift water from lower lakes to mountaintop reservoirs. Then gravity flow could be used at peak power demand periods to generate hydropower for sale to TVA and delivery to its customers. 
<P>   TVA has a memorandum of understanding with AER to aid in the environmental review phase of the project. TVA officials repeatedly have said the agency has no stake in the private power project and might not agree to buy power if the project is completed.
<P>   Patten said Rick Parrish, SELC director, met with SOS members in December and proposed that the center aid with legal services to protect Sequatchie water resources, define impacts of AER power transmission lines and seek flaws in the environmental impact statement proposed for publication this autumn.
<P>   The SELC also works in the Chattanooga area on chip mill and Lyndhurst Foundation business.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Consumer show standouts DVD, WebTV, HDTV pricey gadgets</B></font><basefont size=6><!--SUBHEAD--></basefont></FONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By Pam Park News-Sentinel business writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas can give even the technology-minded a case of sensory overload and gadget garble. This year the exhibits covered more than a million square feet.
<P>   In this crowded field, High Definition Television (HDTV), Digital Video Disc (DVD) and WebTV were prominent products.
<P>   I have to admit, HDTV is impressive. Philips Consumer Electronics Co. was demonstrating HDTV at its booth at the show, which ran Jan. 9-12. It looked better than real life. Honestly, the nature scenes made me wonder if people who saw Yellowstone Park first on HDTV might be disappointed with the real thing. In nature there&#39;s often an atmospheric haze. HDTV is such a high resolution digital product, a picture shot with the right equipment looks almost unnaturally clear and sharp on the television.
<P>   Before I get you too excited about HDTV, I need to tell you the early versions are expected to cost $10,000 each when they come out in 1998. As consumer electronics are prone to do (to the chagrin of manufacturers), they&#39;ll get cheaper over time. Within 10 years, they are expected to sell at a $200-$300 premium over other televisions.
<P>   The television manufacturers are elated about the prospects for HDTV. They see it as an opportunity to replace the<B> </B>millions of television sets in the United States. They think everybody who sees an HDTV set will want one. I think they may be right, but prices will have to come down or wages go up before many of us will be able to indulge.
<P>   The Digital Video Disc is the product the industry hopes will ultimately raise consumer electronics sales from the doldrums.
<P>   DVD is a groundbreaking digital video product that, combined with digital audio, will give a movie-theater quality experience at home.  It&#39;s billed as having a better picture than a videocassette and better sound than a compact disc. It will also offer more capacity. Disc size will drop from 12 inches to five inches, and each five-inch DVD will be able to hold a whole movie, or more than one, depending on how many layers are recorded on it.
<P>   Industry leaders expect DVD will eventually replace CD-ROMs and videocassettes and open the door to sell a lot of related products like DVD-ROM.
<P>   Perhaps so, but the demonstration didn&#39;t grab me like HDTV&#39;s did. The sound was great, but then there were about six speakers positioned around the booth. It was shown on a specially sized television, but they said you could format the picture to fit your television screen without loss of quality.
<P>    You have to buy a player expected to cost between $500 and $700 when it reaches the market this spring. It will play regular music CDs as well as DVD products, however.
<P>   Whether DVD reaches its potential will largely depend on the content -- movies and more -- that will be offered with it, industry leaders say.
<P>   The debut of the machine was delayed by lack of early commitment from content providers, but several stepped forward at the Las Vegas show. Manufacturers would like to see more enthusiasm as they prepare to spend millions on producing the hardware, but they were encouraged by Hollywood&#39;s initial commitments.
<P>   Although people tend to use the term generically, WebTV is actually a company that licensed Sony and Philips to make equipment to surf the Internet from a home television. WebTV provides the consumer Internet access after he or she buys the equipment.
<P>   WebTV targets people who don&#39;t have a computer but who want to surf the Internet and send and receive electonic mail. Only 35 percent of the public is estimated to own a computer and only 10 percent of that number are believed to be using an online service, so the industry sees a big potential market for this device.
<P>   WebTV looks pretty good and is simple to use even if you have never touched a computer.
<P>   Price is a big advantage for WebTV. A Philips Magnavox Internet TV Terminal costs about $400, including a keyboard. Compare that to purchasing a $2,500 computer and WebTV is a sensible alternative for many people. Internet access through WebTV costs $19.95 per month -- about the same as other Internet access providers.
<P>   Manufacturers estimate a million Internet TV terminals will be sold this year.
<P>   To whom?
<P>   Executives would not detail the demographics of the WebTV audience, but they did say surveys showed they look at consumer-oriented sites more than research sites on the Internet. Some use WebTV as a social activity, surfing in groups in a way that is not workable with a personal computer. One executive hinted adult sections of the Internet were important to some users.
<P>   Ed Volkwein, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Philips, told an audience at the electronics show that couch potatoes should stand proud of WebTV survey results.
<P>   &#39;&#39;They are in fact curious people, between beers,&#39;&#39; he said.

		<h3>Comcast gains E! rights</h3>
<P>
<P>
<P>    NEW YORK -- Comcast Corp. announced Friday it has won the right to buy Time Warner Inc.&#39;s controlling stake in E! Entertainment Television, the celebrity news cable network, for $321 million.
<P>    Comcast, the nation&#39;s fourth-largest cable company, is one of five cable operators that are partners in the network. The partners late last year triggered a provision in their partnership agreement allowing for a change of control.
<P>    They still have about a month to resolve the issue.
<P>    Under the provision, each of the four minority partners can buy out Time Warner&#39;s 58.4 percent ownership stake, sell their combined stake to Time Warner or decide to leave the ownership structure unchanged.
<P>    Comcast emerged after talks with the partners with the right to buy out Time Warner. It will now decide whether to proceed with a purchase.
<P>    If Comcast chooses to buy out Time Warner, bringing its stake to 68.8 percent, it will also have the right to buy out the other partners after five years.
<P>    For Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia and has 4.3 million subscribers, the purchase would represent yet another expansion in cable programming.
<P>    The company recently took control of the Philadelphia Flyers and 76ers with an eye toward airing games on its own sports network, which is scheduled to debut in fall 1997. Comcast recently purchased Scripps Howard Cable in Knoxville.
<P>
<P><h3>Hyatt Regency gets new GM</h3> 
<P>
<P>   Tom Mason has been named general manager at the Hyatt Regency Knoxville.
<P>   It is the first general manager assignment for the 37-year-old, who comes to Knoxville from Chicago, where he was corporate director of the rooms division for Hyatt Hotels.
<P>   He has been with Hyatt for 15 years.
<P>   He replaces Patrick Donnelly, who served as general manager for 21 months and recently relocated to Milwaukee, Wis., to take a general manager&#39;s position there.
<P>   Mason and his wife, Pam, have three children.

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Bill Luther, News-Sentinel sportswriter</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<P>   
<P>
<P>   Four drivers who competed in the PPG CART World Series last year have accepted invitations to participate in the International Race of Champions all-star series.
<P>   They are titlist Jimmy Vasser of Las Vegas, rookie of the year Alex Zanardi, a native of Italy, Al Unser Jr. of Albuquerque, N.M., and Robby Gordon of Orange, Calif., They join Winston Cup drivers Mark Martin, Terry Labonte, Jeff Gordon and Dale Jarrett who were selected earlier for the four-race series which begins Feb. 14 at Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway.
<P>   The final four selections are to be announced next week, said Jay Signore, the series president.
<P>   Vasser won four CART races en route to his first Indy car title. He also won five poles.
<P>   &#39;&#39;The chance to be in IROC is special because you have to earn your invitations,&#39;&#39; Vasser said. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s like another benefit that came with winning the PPG Cup.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Zanardi, a Vasser teammate with Chip Ganassi Racing, was a three-time winner in the second half of the season and won six poles.
<P>   Unser, considered the most successful driver in IROC history, will make a record 12th consecutive appearance. He has a record 10 IROC wins and won the championship in 1986 and 1988. A.J. Foyt, Dale Earnhardt and Martin are other two-time champs.
<P>   Gordon, who will run the 32-race Cup series this year, focused on CART throughout the year. His second IROC invitation was good for four race victories and the Off-Road Trophy Truck championship.
<P>
<P>   <B>CREAM OF CROP: </B>Winston Cup racing attracted a record 5,588,069 fans last season, an increase of 4.9 percent. The CART Indy series (2,366,440) and IRL Indy events (1,144,002) combined for 3,510,442.
<P>   NHRA drag racing ranked third overall with 1,869,437 and the NASCAR Busch Grand National series fourth (1,665,437). 
<P>  The Craftsman Truck competition drew (811,050) and IROC events (284,447), sanctioned by NASCAR, hiked the four-series ticket sales to 8,349,266.
<P>
<P>   <B>TOUGH ROAD: </B>The Maxwell House Award, the most recent hardware to be added to Earnhardt&#39;s Winston Cup career, came as a result of the quick recovery from a mid-season accident at Talladega Superspeedway on July 28. He suffered a broken collar bone, cracked sternum and bruised hip in the accident.
<P>   A week later he turned his Chevrolet over to Mike Skinner after six laps, but he was able to complete the remaining races.
<P>   Other nominees were Dale Jarrett, Ricky Craven and Cup champion Terry Labonte.

		<FONT SIZE="6"><B>Reeves to control Falcons</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"><BR> Five-year deal worth $7.5-8M</FONT></BASEFONT><P>
		<FONT size="2"><I>By The Associated Press</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>TLANTA -- Having made the playoffs only five times in their 31 years, the Atlanta Falcons on Monday turned to Dan Reeves, the NFL&#39;s winningest active coach.
<P>    Reeves, who was fired by the New York Giants after the season, signed a five-year deal as coach and head of football operations. He succeeds June Jones and will be introduced at a news conference today.
<P>    The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Reeves&#39; contract is worth $7.5 million to $8 million -- almost double what any previous Falcons coach has earned.
<P>    &#39;&#39;It&#39;s exciting, knowing he&#39;s going to be here for the next five years,&#39;&#39; said Robbie Tobeck, an offensive guard who was in the weight room at the Falcons&#39; training complex in Suwanee when the announcement was made.
<P>    &#39;&#39;We&#39;re ready to get things rolling. It gives us something to look forward to next year -- a new coach, a new system.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Reeves, 53, returns to the state where he was born and takes over a club coming off another dismal season. Atlanta, which has had only seven winning seasons in its history, slumped to 3-13 this season, a year marked by a public dispute between Jones and quarterback Jeff George.
<P>    George was released after playing only three games and Jones lost his job at the end of the season, despite having two years left on his contract.
<P>    Reeves was fired by the Giants after 31-33 record and one playoff appearance in four seasons. He has a career record of 149-113-1, making him the 10th winningest coach in NFL history.
<P>    The Falcons interviewed only two candidates to succeed Jones, both with ties to Georgia.
<P>    Bobby Ross, a former Georgia Tech coach who was ousted by the San Diego Chargers, was apparently the top choice. He took the Detroit job last week.
<P>    Reeves originally interviewed with the Falcons in 1977 while an assistant with the Dallas Cowboys. The job was given to Leeman Bennett.
<P>    &#39;&#39;This time, I don&#39;t question my qualifications or my resolve,&#39;&#39; Reeves said recently.
<P>    Reeves is the 11th coach in Falcons history, and he will have more control than any of his predecessors.
<P>    &#39;&#39;I think it&#39;s the right direction,&#39;&#39; Tobeck said. &#39;&#39;Obviously, he&#39;s shown that he can win.&#39;&#39;
<P>    Reeves faces a major rebuilding job. He&#39;s likely to bring a more traditional offense than the run-and-shoot Jones employed in his three seasons. The defense, among the worst the past several seasons, also must be upgraded.

		<h3>Referee drops charges against basketball coach</h3> 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>   A Tennessee high school referee is dropping assault charges against a girls&#39; basketball coach he said grabbed him after her team suffered a two-point loss.
<P>   Referee <B>Mark Morrison</B> said he didn&#39;t want the publicity that would come from pressing the misdemeanor charge against Battle Ground Academy coach <B>Gretchen Eisenhauer</B>.
<P>   The incident occurred in December after BGA lost 45-43 to Brentwood High during a December tournament.
<P>   Brentwood police reports say Eisenhauer grabbed Morrison&#39;s arm outside the gym and then grabbed his shoulder to spin him around. She demanded to know why he had given her a technical foul during the game, police said.
<P>   BGA imposed a six-game suspension on Eisenhauer. The Tennessee Secondary Schools Athletic Association suspended Eisenhauer for eight games, fined BGA $350 and placed the girls basketball program on probation through the end of the 1997-98 school year.
<P>

third class mail with a cost-efficient delivery alternative to
the United States Postal Service.</p>

samples, etc. more economically than direct mail.</p>

<h4 align="center"><u>ADD's MARKET FACTS</u></h4>

products weekly using a dedicated adult carrier force of
independent contractors. Delivery begins on Tuesday and ends by 7
pm of Wednesday of each week. Optional delivery windows are
available with some price modification.</p>

<p>Verification is maximized with a team of Independent Quality
Control Representatives. These individuals are in the field
within one hour of delivery commencement and armed with a tape
recorder, polaroid camera, pager, and 15 randomly selected
addresses per route. Their goal is to ensure early detection of
problems and accurate delivery of your product.</p>

		<FONT size="2"><I>By Jesse Fox Mayshark, News-Sentinel staff writer</I></FONT><P>
		<FONT SIZE="3"><I></I></FONT><BR>
		<FONT SIZE="+2">A</FONT>t the beginning of every month, the Social Security Administration mails about 300,000 disability checks worth some $136 million to Tennessee.
<P>   It&#39;s an amount that&#39;s 81/2 times greater than the $16 million or so that&#39;s doled out each month in Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the cash payment program known as &#39;&#39;welfare.&#39;&#39;
<P>   But until recently, federal disability payments have generated little discussion or debate. Now that&#39;s changing.
<P>   On Jan. 3, the most controversial disability checks -- to people certified as drug addicts or alcoholics -- will end.
<P>   That will have a big impact in Tennessee, which has nearly 9,300 addicts and alcoholics on its disability rolls, the sixth-highest number in the nation and the third-highest number per capita.
<P>   In July, another change takes effect. Children who receive disability payments because they have &#39;&#39;maladaptive behaviors,&#39;&#39; such as attention deficit disorder (ADD), will have to be re-evaluated.
<P>   Officials estimate 7,000 children in Tennessee will be re-tested, and some of them will lose their monthly benefit.
<P>   Moreover, the Social Security Adminstration is looking for ways nationwide to take more people off disability and put them to work.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We&#39;ve done a lot of things over the last few years to get people back in the work force,&#39;&#39; said Jim Rovere, Social Security district manager for Knox, Loudon, Union and Sevier counties. &#39;&#39;But my own observation is that there haven&#39;t been a lot of success stories.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>History
<P>
<P>   The first thing Rovere thinks people should know about disability payments is that there are two different kinds: Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). He said people often confuse the two.
<P>   SSDI grew out of the main Social Security system in 1954. It is a payment given to adults who have worked in the past but have become disabled.
<P>   The amount of a monthly SSDI payment depends on how long a person worked and how much he or she paid into Social Security during that time. Like Social Security payments to retirees, SSDI payments come out of the Social Security Trust Fund.
<P>   The average payment for a disabled American worker was $682 per month at the beginning of 1996, although Rovere said payments can range as high as $1,300 a month.
<P>   Supplemental Security Income, on the other hand, is essentially a welfare program administered by the Social Security Administration.
<P>   Rovere said individual states used to pay welfare checks to disabled adults with little or no income. But payments varied so much between the states that Congress decided in 1974 to have the Social Security Administration take over the program.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It provided kind of an equal floor of support that would be administered the same across the country,&#39;&#39; Rovere said.
<P>   Unlike SSDI benefits, SSI checks are paid out of the general federal budget, not out of the Social Security Trust Fund.
<P>   Monthly SSI payments range up to a maximum of $470. When children are certified as disabled, the payments go to their parents or caretakers.
<P>   Whether someone gets SSDI or SSI depends on his or her work history. Disabled people who have worked for a number of years would get SSDI, while those with little or no work history would get SSI. If someone&#39;s SSDI payment is low enough, they can get both SSDI and SSI.
<P>   Recipients of SSI also qualify for TennCare health insurance.
<P>
<P>Who&#39;s disabled?
<P>
<P>   Deciding who qualifies for disability payments is the trickiest part of the system and the one most subject to second-guessing.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve seen so much unfairness in the system,&#39;&#39; said U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville. &#39;&#39;I&#39;ve seen people who were almost dead who have been denied (disability benefits). And yet we all know there are people out there who appear to be more healthy than I am and you are who are drawing disability.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Duncan said his office deals with a lot of disability cases, most of them people trying to get benefits.
<P>   But Rovere said the public perception that a lot of perfectly healthy people are collecting disability checks is wrong.
<P>   &#39;&#39;All the people that are approved have to have a medical diagnosis,&#39;&#39; he said. He said many disabilities -- especially mental problems like schizophrenia -- aren&#39;t visible but seriously hamper people&#39;s ability to work.
<P>   Rovere said the Social Security Administration turns down 70 percent of all disability applications.
<P>   The process works as follows:
<P>   * An applicant comes to the Social Security office to file for disability. If they have already had a medical exam, they must submit their records. If not, Social Security workers order an exam.
<P>   * The application and medical records are sent to the Disability Determination Section in Nashville, a branch of the state&#39;s Department of Human Services.
<P>   * State disability examiners review each claim and contact any doctors treating the claimant. If examiners have questions, they can refer them to medical consultants or order a second examination and diagnosis. The process takes three to four weeks.
<P>   * If the medical evidence shows a disability is severe enough to prevent &#39;&#39;substantial employment,&#39;&#39; the applicant will qualify for a monthly check.
<P>   Carroll Moore, director of Tennessee&#39;s Disability Determination Section, said the system has several checks and balances. But he admitted some people with questionable disabilities might slip through.
<P>   &#39;&#39;We try to prevent that from happening, but many times, especially with mental disorders, we have to take the information supplied&#39;&#39; from doctors and psychologists, Moore said.
<P>   Still, for many people, qualifying for a disability check is no easy task.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s hard to get certified,&#39;&#39; said Susan Chapman, a 55-year-old former nurse&#39;s aide. &#39;&#39;It took me over a year. It took me 14 months to get certified.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Chapman, a Knoxville resident, has been on disability for eight years for nervous problems. She said the monthly check has been a blessing.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It&#39;s wonderful,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s some people who cannot work.&#39;&#39;
<P>
<P>Public outcry
<P>
<P>   But if disability payments provide a helping hand to many, critics of the program think they&#39;re also vulnerable to abuse.
<P>   That&#39;s been illustrated recently in two well-publicized aspects of the program: drug and alcohol benefits and checks to children with attention deficit disorder (ADD).
<P>   National television news reports have shown people using their disability payments to buy drugs and alcohol and parents encouraging children to act up so they&#39;ll be certified as ADD.
<P>   Rovere said both problems are relatively new.
<P>   As the medical profession began to regard drug and alcohol addiction as diseases, addicts began qualifying for disability checks. Over the past five years, Rovere said word of the payments spread among addicts and alcoholics, and many of them began to apply for them.
<P>   Tennessee saw more than its share of applications. Of the nation&#39;s 200,000 certified addicts, 9,300 live in Tennessee. Knox, Sevier, Union and Loudon counties have 1,600 certified addicts.
<P>   Rovere said the high numbers could have come about because Tennessee social workers were &#39;&#39;more in tune to the fact that drug addiction was a (certifiable) diagnosis.&#39;&#39;
<P>   But even some addicts think the policy has been a mistake.
<P>   &#39;&#39;To me, they&#39;re abusing it,&#39;&#39; said Joey Trillo, a 25-year-old Vonore native in a treatment program at Knox Area Rescue Ministries. &#39;&#39;There&#39;s a lot of really bad alcoholics that got disability from alcoholism. I&#39;m an alcoholic myself, and I&#39;m pretty bad. But I would rather work.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Trillo and others in the treatment program said they had seen fellow alcoholics buy booze, then lie to officials about how they spent their disability checks.
<P>   In response to complaints about the program, Congress earlier this year voted to end drug and alcohol benefits as of January 1997.
<P>   Attention Deficit Disorder also has become an increasingly popular diagnosis in the past decade.
<P>   &#39;&#39;As parents, especially parents with very limited income and needy families, found that the children could get disability benefits of $470 a month . . . it just became a way for families to get disability benefits,&#39;&#39; Rovere said.
<P>   Those benefits aren&#39;t ending, but all children with &#39;&#39;maladaptive disorders,&#39;&#39; which includes ADD, will have to be re-evaluated under stricter guidelines in 1997. As many as 200,000 nationwide will lose their disability checks.
<P>   Even with those issues addressed, however, broader questions about who should be on disability remain.
<P>   Tom Margenau, a spokesman at Social Security Administration headquarters in Baltimore, said only 1 to 2 percent of those certified for disability checks ever move back into the workplace, but officials say a much larger number probably could be retrained for employment.
<P>   That&#39;s borne out by Social Security fraud investigators. They often find people getting disability checks who are also working and not reporting their income.
<P>   &#39;&#39;A lot of times, people will work under a different name and Social Security number in order to conceal their wages,&#39;&#39; said James Farr, a special agent with Social Security&#39;s Office of Investigation in Atlanta.
<P>   Farr said those caught defrauding the system can be fined and jailed for up to five years.
<P>   Rep. Duncan, who voted for the drug and alcohol and ADD reforms, said he would like to see better regulation and more consistency in the system. He said the perception of abuse harms the people who are supposed to be helped by SSDI and SSI.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think it&#39;s a very serious problem for our society,&#39;&#39; he said. &#39;&#39;Obviously, when you have someone drawing disability who doesn&#39;t need it, it&#39;s taking money away from people who genuinely need it.&#39;&#39;

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">I</font>n a first-floor room at an old Red
        Carpet Inn in West Knoxville, Leonard Keith Williams
        strums his guitar to pass the time, singing about how it
        never rains in Southern California. </p>
        <p>''I sing it to myself sometimes, when I'm depressed,''
        said Williams, 42, as he sat cross-legged on his double
        bed while December sunlight beamed through a plate glass
        window. </p>
        <p>He rents the room -- called a ''studio apartment''
        because the hotel is closed -- for $370 a month, money
        that will disappear in 1997. </p>
        <p>Williams is one of the 1,600 people in the Knoxville
        area who will lose monthly disability payments for
        alcohol or drug problems. They face an uncertain future. </p>
        <p>''I'm gonna have to try to work,'' said Williams, who
        has been sober for about seven months. ''If I can't, then
        I have to hit the streets, stay at the mission, Salvation
        Army, somewhere. I'll have no choice.'' </p>
        <p>Williams admits he's an alcoholic. He said he's been
        in five treatment programs. But he also has two
        artificial hips and osteoarthritis. He suffers from
        depression and has trouble sleeping -- getting three or
        four hours on a good night. </p>
        <p>For all those reasons, he expects work will be hard to
        come by. Even though he's sober, employers will look
        skeptically at his past. He'll need to rest every couple
        hours if his 12-year-old artifical hips act up. </p>
        <p>''If I sit for too long, I start hurting. If I walk
        for too long, I start hurting. If I stand for too long, I
        start hurting,'' he said. ''It's all pressure on the
        hip.'' </p>
        <p>As he speaks, Williams occasionally sips from a pink
        plastic cup of iced tea. His room is pungent with the
        smoke of countless cigarettes -- GPC Approved. ''Cheapest
        things I can find. $8.69 a carton right up here at the
        Exxon. Plus tax.'' </p>
        <p>While precise dates are elusive, Williams has a
        portfolio of paperwork documenting his past. </p>
        <p>He used to make good money as a sewing machine
        mechanic. Levi Strauss &amp; Co. put him through two
        treatment programs but let him go in 1990. Williams said
        he made about $35,000 a year there as a technical
        training specialist. He still has a business card, a
        reminder of better days. </p>
        <p>Williams' problem drinking began in the early 1980s.
        He fell down the steps of a pool hall in 1984, tripping
        over a compressor on his way to the men's room after he'd
        been drinking. He sufferred multiple concussions. </p>
        <p>Doctors gave him steroids as he recovered. He was told
        the steroids might have caused his hips to deteriorate.
        His drinking continued, and he entered his first
        treatment center in 1985. </p>
        <p>After Levi Strauss let him go -- he said the firm had
        done what they could for him -- he spent most of 1991 and
        1992 homeless. He slept at shelters or outside if it was
        warm. </p>
        <p>He worked menial jobs -- selling light bulbs over the
        phone, washing dishes -- and sought help in various
        programs. But life got harder. </p>
        <p>In 1994, just weeks after finishing an eight-week
        course at Miracle Lake Christian Training Center in
        Etowah -- ''Basic Introduction to the Lifestyle of Jesus
        Christ'' -- Williams' 20-year-old son killed himself. </p>
        <p>''There's his picture over there,'' he said, motioning
        to a photograph of a handsome blond youth kneeling on one
        knee, smiling. Suicide wasn't new to Williams. His father
        shot himself on Williams' 11th birthday. </p>
        <p>The drinking started again. </p>
        <p>Williams, a Vietnam-era Marine veteran, went through a
        substance-abuse course at the Department of Veterans
        Affairs hospital in Murfreesboro, then went to a veterans
        program in Nashville. He relapsed and went to the
        Nashville VA to be treated for depression. </p>
        <p>In mid-1995, he started getting a disability check. He
        gets $1,859 a month -- $929.50 in current benefits and
        $929.50 in back pay. </p>
        <p>The current benefits end this month. The back pay will
        end this summer. </p>
        <p>''I will probably try to work before it runs out. I
        may have to swap jobs three or four times to find one I
        can work 40 hours a week at,'' Williams said, deferring
        again to his hip trouble. </p>
        <p>He'll appeal the government's decision to cut off his
        benefits. </p>
        <p>He'll explain that his physical problems make work
        difficult even without the alcoholism. But appeals can
        take years to decide. </p>
        <p>''What'll I do in between?'' Williams wondered,
        although he had a ready answer. ''I'll just hit the
        streets if I find out I can't work.'' </p>

        <p>The government defines disability as ''the inability
        to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason
        of any medically determinable physical or mental
        impairment which can be expected to result in death or
        has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous
        period of not less than 12 months.'' </p>
        <p>Two kinds of disability payments: </p>
        <p><b>Social Security Disability Insurance, or SSDI</b>:
        This payment is for adults who have worked in the past
        but became disabled. </p>
        <p><b>Supplemental Security Income, or SSI</b>: This
        payment is essentially a welfare check, given to disabled
        individuals with little or no work history or income. </p>
        <p><b>Disability payments </b></p>
        <p><b>United States </b></p>
        <p><b>Total: </b>10.8 million disability checks worth
        about $5.1 billion are mailed monthly. </p>
        <p><b>SSI:</b> 4,984,467 disabled recipients got

        <p><b>Total: </b>More than 300,000 checks worth about
        $136 million are sent to Tennesseans monthly </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">B</font>y 9 a.m. on a cold December
        morning Eugene Blalock had already consumed a pint of
        liquor. </p>
        <p>''It gets rid of the shakes, see?'' the 50-year-old
        Army veteran explained in the smoke-filled basement
        office where he got his last monthly drug-and-alcohol
        disability check. </p>
        <p>The federal government has decided to stop giving
        money to Blalock and about 1,600 other people in the
        Knoxville area who claim to be disabled because of
        alcoholism or drug addiction. </p>
        <p>Blalock has been getting $470 a month. Some checks
        stopped in December. His last one will be on Jan. 3. </p>
        <p>Congress and President Clinton have realized what
        social workers, counselors and many addicts have said for
        years: It's a bad idea to give people money for being
        substance abusers. </p>
        <p>The ''Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996,''
        enacted March 29, ends disability payments to about
        200,000 alcoholics and drug addicts, including nearly
        9,300 in Tennessee -- the sixth-highest state total in
        the nation and the third-highest per capita. </p>
        <p>One in every 567 Tennesseans has been getting a
        disability check for alcoholism or drug addiction, based
        on figures from the Social Security Administration and
        the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
        <p>When the money stops, the consequences could affect
        not only clients but the community as a whole: </p>
        <p>* Addicts who lose payments altogether could end up
        homeless or turn to crime to feed their addiction. </p>
        <p>''That's the talk on the street, among street
        people,'' said Barry Furches, 41, a homeless man who is
        losing some of his benefits. ''They're going to start
        taking what they want. They're too sick to work.'' </p>
        <p>* Some addicts will apply for disability benefits
        because of physical or mental impairments. If approved,
        they'll continue to get a government check to spend on
        alcohol or drugs. </p>
        <p>''They're going to be given the keys to the candy
        store once again,'' said Dan Caldwell, president of
        Cornerstone of Recovery, a drug and alcohol treatment
        center. ''It's really harmful to give an alcoholic or
        drug-dependent person money.'' </p>
        <p>* Some might go to work, thankful for the temporary
        assistance and willing to accept that it doesn't last
        forever. </p>
        <p>''I feel like I need to be working,'' said James
        Prater, a 41-year-old unemployed printer who's been
        getting $490 a month. ''I drank for 20-some years and I
        saw that I needed help and the government helped me to
        get help.'' </p>
        <p>While exact figures aren't available from the Social
        Security Administration, the agency estimates that
        perhaps $4 million a month is paid to Tennesseans who are
        disabled due to drugs or alcohol. </p>
        <p>Most get the money because they're poor. </p>
        <p>About 76 percent of Tennessee's 9,266 drug and alcohol
        recipients get Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the
        kind of disability that's paid to people with little or
        no work history. </p>
        <p>The other kind of disability is Social Security
        Disability Insurance for people who have worked. </p>
        <p>Some people get both types of checks. </p>
        <p>Although drug and alcohol checks are being cut off,
        many social workers say the government should still help
        substance abusers by getting them into treatment programs
        instead of handing them money. </p>
        <p>State and local officials are uncertain how much money
        will be made available. But even if more money arrives,
        some addicts say they've been in treatment over and over
        again without getting clean. </p>
        <p>''There's no perfect system,'' said U.S. Rep. John J.
        Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, ''and I suppose there will be
        problems in anything that we come up with. But I think
        that cutting down on the people who are receiving this
        money because of drug and alcohol addictions will help a
        whole lot more than it will hurt. </p>
        <p>''I think it will force some of these people to take
        action to end their addictions rather than helping
        maintain the addictions that they have.'' </p>
        <p>Drunk and disabled </p>
        <p>Disability payments have been around for years, but
        Social Security officials said the idea of getting checks
        for being drunk or on drugs has gained popularity in the
        current decade. </p>
        <p>''What happened was the evaluation -- just the idea
        that that could be used (to get benefits), became
        generally known,'' said Jim Rovere, district manager for
        the Social Security Administration in Knox, Loudon, Union
        and Sevier counties. </p>
        <p>''About three years ago, that really started to get
        heavy. About four or five years ago, I'd say we had
        almost no one.'' </p>
        <p>The word on the street was that if you wanted to
        receive a disability check, drugs and alcohol provided
        the quickest route to getting it. </p>
        <p>''Historically, that's been the easiest way for them
        to get on benefits,'' said David Yoder, executive
        director of the Knoxville Legal Aid Society. </p>
        <p>''These people usually are low-income (and) don't have
        a medical history. They've not been able to afford to go
        to doctors, to get diagnosed, to undergo the examinations
        and the medical tests to document their other
        disabilities. It costs a lot of money to prove that
        you're disabled.'' </p>
        <p>Addictions can be documented more easily -- with lost
        jobs, arrests or hospital visits for public intoxication,
        Yoder said. </p>
        <p>While few observers -- advocates, social workers and
        recipients themselves -- support subsidizing addiction,
        ending the payments will bring its own set of problems. </p>
        <p>Off the dole </p>
        <p>Laquetta Ferguson's hands shook, her leg bounced and
        her Marlboro burned an inch-long ash as she talked about
        the prospect of losing her $470-a-month disability check.
        </p>
        <p>''I don't know what (will) happen 'cause I'm doing the
        best I can do right now,'' said the slight 44-year-old
        woman, who said she's suffered a lifetime of abuse
        through six marriages. She lives in an old trailer in
        Lenoir City with her 18-year-old daughter and her newborn
        grandchild. She recently had a cancerous breast removed. </p>
        <p>''We're going to be homeless,'' she said, pausing to
        let the idea sink in. She finished her thought with a
        resigned laugh. ''That's the truth, and that just about
        made me cry when I said that.'' </p>
        <p>The Social Security Administration estimates about 500
        of the 1,600 drug and alcohol cases in Knox, Loudon,
        Union and Sevier counties have appealed their
        terminations so far -- that is, they have sought money
        for other disabilities. The agency expects that about
        1,400 people still will be cut off. </p>
        <p>Ferguson missed the original reapplication deadline. </p>
        <p>''At the right date I was in the hospital getting my
        breast took off,'' she explained. </p>
        <p>Some who lose benefits will turn to the state welfare
        system for help. Charities expect more traffic. The
        homeless expect their population to grow. Ex-addicts
        expect crime to increase. </p>
        <p>''I've seen a lot of fear in people, people who are
        addicts and who are receving income,'' said Monroe Free,
        president of Knox Area Rescue Ministries, which expects
        to be providing even more food, clothing and shelter at
        its North Broadway mission. </p>
        <p>''They don't know what they're going to do with
        themselves. The ones I know do not have great skills and
        do not have great confidence in themselves and their
        ability to handle these kinds of crises.'' </p>
        <p>Crime is an option, some said. </p>
        <p>''They're going to start handling drugs, selling it,
        robbing, stealing. They're gonna go to something because
        there's just no jobs out there for them,'' said Joe
        Burkhart, a Vietnam veteran and ex-convict who has abused
        alcohol and drugs but also has other ailments. </p>
        <p>Said Sarah Sanders, 37, who will be losing $470 a
        month: ''I can't say what I'm gonna do. I don't know. I
        might have to turn into a hooker or something.'' She
        smiled. ''Seriously, you never know what you might have
        to do. I have four kids -- 16, 13, 8 and 2.'' </p>
        <p>Despite such talk, Capt. Paul Fish, east district
        commander for the Knoxville Police Department, isn't
        dreading a crime wave. </p>
        <p>''That's what they're saying, but I really can't prove
        that one way or the other,'' he said. ''There may be some
        of that, but to what rate is hard to say.'' </p>
        <p>Drunk and disabled </p>
        <p>The government will decide that some drug and alcohol
        abusers, like recovering addict Rochane Angel, have other
        disabilities that still qualify them for monthly checks. </p>
        <p>The problem is how those checks will be spent. </p>
        <p>''(A monthly payment of) $470 is a lot of money when
        you're out there using,'' said Angel, 33. Drug pushers
        are glad to take it. </p>
        <p>''Every month (dealers were) standing outside waiting,
        standing at the mailbox,'' she said. ''They'd get
        prepared for the first, second and third. That's when
        they made the money -- is on the first, and I know
        because I've been there.'' </p>
        <p>In March 1995, the Social Security Administration
        started using social-service agencies to distribute drug
        and alcohol disability checks. </p>
        <p>For a 10-percent fee with a $50 maximum, the agencies
        made sure the money at least paid for rent, utilities,
        food and other necessities. </p>
        <p>''I don't think it's kept a lot of people off alcohol
        and drugs, but at least it's kept them off the street,''
        said Gordon Acuff, executive director of the East
        Tennessee Human Resource Agency, another local payee. </p>
        <p>Angel's money is handled by Recovery Support Systems
        on Magnolia Avenue, opened by Whit and Melissa Mabry in
        May 1995. The Mabrys met while working at the
        Detoxification Rehabilitation Institute, where police
        bring public inebriates to dry out. </p>
        <p>At DRI, Melissa Mabry said: ''I just couldn't believe
        then that they were giving (alcoholics) checks. The first
        of the month would be awful, to see these people come
        back just so drunk.'' </p>
        <p>She'd ask where their money went. ''We got a hotel
        room . . . and we lived it up,'' they'd say. </p>
        <p>Payment agencies dread what happens when a drug or
        alcohol abuser -- even someone who's been clean and sober
        for months -- gets an entire monthly check in his hands. </p>
        <p>''He's not going to pay his rent,'' Acuff said. ''He's
        going to be kicked out of his apartment. He's not going
        to be able to pay his utilities. They're going to cut his
        power off. He's going to be living under the bridge. He's
        going to be bumming off somebody else, and as soon as he
        gets his check, he's going to congregate with friends he
        has who drink with him and they're going to drink it up.
        In two or three days, they're right back where they
        were.'' </p>
        <p>Said Glenda Loope, who manages ETHRA's representative
        payee program: ''Just because someone sitting in an
        office somewhere reading some files says he has another
        disability . . . does not mean that that client is still
        not an addict or an alcoholic.'' </p>
        <p>Social Security officials said some clients will still
        be required to have representative agency payees. </p>
        <p>''Their checks would be handled by a third-party payee
        if they're incapable,'' Rovere said. ''If it's just
        physical and there's not a mental impairment or an
        obvious case of still having a drug addiction, then they
        would get their own check.'' </p>
        <p>The number of drug and alcohol clients who will
        continue to get disability checks for physical or mental
        problems remains to be seen because so few have
        reapplied. </p>
        <p>Said Rovere: ''The feeling is when the checks don't
        come in January, they'll all come in here and say,
        'Where's my check and how do I get it started again?' '' </p>
        <p>Going to work </p>
        <p>Prater, the unemployed printer who feels the system
        helped him, said he applied for disability in the spring
        of 1995. </p>
        <p>''I did what I was supposed to do,'' he explained
        matter-of-factly. ''I paid my rent, my bills and tried to
        get my life back together. It's worked, by doing what I
        was supposed to do, by not drinking and going to
        meetings.'' </p>
        <p>He agreed that the government needs to look more
        closely at who receives checks so that the payments go to
        people who are staying sober. </p>
        <p>''I've got back trouble and bad knee troubles, and I
        could probably use that as an excuse not to work,''
        Prater said. ''But I know people that doesn't have legs,
        doesn't have arms. They're making a living every day. I
        feel pretty grateful.'' </p>
        <p>Not everyone shares Prater's confidence. </p>
        <p>''You can't find a job if you have a history of drugs
        and alcohol. Ain't nobody gonna hire you,'' Burkhart
        said. ''They're gonna be like hawks. Every slip-up is
        gonna be blamed on, 'You're back on drugs and alcohol.'
        '' </p>
        <p>Also, addicts typically have deeper problems. </p>
        <p>''We've got people out there who have minimal social
        skills,'' said Pete Shelton, a counselor who doesn't like
        giving checks to addicts but fears leaving them helpless.
        </p>
        <p>''We have people out there who are functionally
        illiterate. We have people out there with a plethora of
        social problems, and in essence what we're doing is
        saying, 'OK, it's time to get a job now.' </p>
        <p>''Who in the hell is going to hire these people?'' </p>
        <p>Whether they turn to charity, government programs or
        crime in order to support themselves, it will cost the
        larger society something. </p>
        <p>''Far more than giving them the $470 a month,'' said
        Charlie Parsons, a homeless outreach worker with the
        Community Action Committee. ''It's really going to come
        down on the local government.'' </p>
        <p>Congressman Duncan said state and local governments
        are in better financial shape than Washington, D.C.,
        which already funds more social programs than he can
        remember. </p>
        <p>But while congressmen, counselors, agencies and
        activists debate the issue, people like Eugene Blalock
        wonder what's coming next. </p>
        <p>Sitting at Recovery Report Systems with an Orlando
        Magic cap pulled down tightly on his head, Blalock said
        he's been grateful for the help that he has received. </p>
        <p>''They pay my rent, and I thank God for that. I really
        do. The truth's the truth,'' he said. ''But I cannot quit
        drinking. I'll drink till the day I die. Probably kill
        myself by drinking. That's it. </p>
        <p>''I hate to say that that way -- you know what I mean?
        But the truth's the truth.'' </p>

		<FONT SIZE="+2">E</FONT>xactly why Tennessee has had the sixth-highest number of residents getting disability checks for alcoholism and drug addiction is unclear.
<P>   &#39;&#39;It surprised us when we first heard it back in the spring,&#39;&#39; said Carroll Moore, director of the Disability Determination Section in Nashville which decides whether people qualify for disability checks.
<P>   The Social Security Administration reports 9,266 Tennesseans getting disability checks for being drug addicts or alcoholics, placing it sixth in the nation with addiction numbers exceeded only by much more populous states.
<P>   Taking population into account, one in 567 Tennesseans has gotten a drug or alcohol disability check. That puts Tennessee third in the nation on a per capita basis, behind Illnois (one in every 496 residents) and Kentucky (one in 557).
<P>   The last checks to addicts go out Jan. 3.
<P>   Only about half of those 9,000-plus clients, however, responded to notices mailed by the Social Security Administration warning them they&#39;ll lose money unless they&#39;re recertified with a different disability.
<P>   &#39;&#39;That&#39;s not surprising since these tend to be some of the most disabled and dysfunctional people on the Social Security rolls,&#39;&#39; said Jack Gustafson, executive director of the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors in Washington.
<P>   Jon Michael, deputy director of the Detoxification Rehabilitation Institute in Knoxville, speculated that the high Tennessee numbers started a while back.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Tennessee for some reason several years ago was selected as a pilot state when they first began monitoring drug and alcohol cases, so that might have raised the awareness (of social workers),&#39;&#39; Michael guessed.
<P>   Others said it&#39;s easier to get certified for a drug or an alcohol problem than for physical ailments.
<P>   &#39;&#39;Local attorneys were very aware of (drug and alcohol) as a valid basis of disability,&#39;&#39; said David Sewell, assistant manager of the Social Security district office in Knoxville.
<P>   David Patterson, assistant professor in the University of Tennessee College of Social Work, speculated that the state has a lot of people with little education and low levels of social support. He also said states might classify disability cases differently.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any one single factor going on here,&#39;&#39; said Patterson, who teaches a course in substance-abuse treatment. &#39;&#39;I think you have poverty, low education levels, low literacy rates, high smoking rates.&#39;&#39;
<P>   Social Security officials lean toward the idea that Tennessee classifies drug and alcohol cases more accurately than other states.
<P>   Sewell said drug and alcohol addicts require a little extra work. For instance, a representative payee must be found to handle their checks.
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think most of the (Disability Determination Sections) just didn&#39;t code the things,&#39;&#39; Sewell said, due to the extra work. &#39;&#39;Well, Tennessee did. . . . That&#39;s what we think it is. It&#39;s a good reflection on the Tennessee DDS all these years.
<P>   
<P>   &#39;&#39;I think any other sources . . . would bear that out -- that you don&#39;t have more drunks here, more drug addicts here, more drug usage here in Tennessee than anywhere else. I think it&#39;s just a matter of how the DDS did their (job).&#39;&#39;

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">J</font>ohn McCook is used to anxious
        parents. </p>
        <p>As head of special education for the Knox County
        schools, he sees them every day. They ask for evaluations
        to see if their children have disabilities that might
        require special help with classwork or behavior. </p>
        <p>But sometimes school officials sense parents are less
        interested in what the evaluation means for their
        children than what it means for their checkbooks. </p>
        <p>It's one manifestation of the boom in children
        receiving federal disability checks for attention deficit
        disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactive disorder
        (ADHD). </p>
        <p>''We (have seen) a definite increase in the informa </p>
        <p>tion-seeking forms that came in,'' said McCook, who
        also serves as Knox County's director of pupil personnel.
        ''It's not usually that overt. It's usually parents
        coming in and being very adamant about getting the
        certification.'' </p>
        <p>If a family's income is low enough, a child with ADD
        or another behavioral disorder can qualify for a
        Supplemental Security Income (SSI) check of up to $470 a
        month. </p>
        <p>''A lot of parents encouraged it because it was money
        to them,'' said Jim Rovere, Social Security district
        manager for Knox, Loudon, Sevier and Union counties. </p>
        <p>But concerns about abuse in the system have prompted a
        new set of rules by the Social Security Administration,
        which oversees SSI. </p>
        <p>In 1997, all children diagnosed with ''maladaptive
        disorders'' -- which includes ADD and ADHD -- will be
        re-evaluated under new and stricter guidelines. </p>
        <p>In Tennessee, officials estimate 7,000 children will
        be affected. As many as two-thirds of them will lose
        their disability checks, Social Security officials said. </p>
        <p>Advocates for disabled children say it's too early to
        gauge the impact of the changes. </p>
        <p>''Since the Social Security Administration has not
        issued any regulations yet, we're unable to get a handle
        on what it's going to mean for people,'' said Jeff
        Rosenberg, a spokesman for the national advocacy group,
        Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder. </p>
        <p>But McCook said if the re-evaluations take some of the
        focus off labeling children rather than helping them, it
        will be a step in the right direction. </p>
        <p>''I don't think you (should) label students any more
        than you have to,'' he said. </p>
        <p><strong>A growing deficit </strong></p>
        <p>ADD and ADHD emerged as recognized medical conditions
        in the 1980s when they were added to the Diagnostic and
        Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the handbook of
        psychologists and psychiatrists. They replaced older,
        vaguer conditions like ''hyperactivity.'' </p>
        <p>Both conditions are marked by difficulty in focusing
        on tasks for prolonged periods, and ADHD also includes
        hyperactive behavior. Many children diagnosed with ADD or
        ADHD are medicated with drugs like Ritalin. </p>
        <p>Medical and educational experts say the conditions are
        real and, in their most severe forms, drastically affect
        social and academic development. </p>
        <p>But many also question whether labeling children with
        minor forms of ADD is helpful. Some children who exhibit
        ADD tendencies at a young age eventually grow out of
        them. </p>
        <p>''My own opinion is I think we're diagnosing this too
        often right now,'' said Dr. Debbie Christiansen, a
        Knoxville pediatrician who treats more than 1,000
        children. ''Almost anybody who has a few attention
        problems, somebody wants them on medication whether it's
        a parent or a teacher or a doctor or a psychologist or
        whatever. I'm really uncomfortable with that.'' </p>
        <p>The problem has been partly fueled by SSI. </p>
        <p>Tom Margenau, a spokesman at Social Security
        Administration headquarters in Baltimore, said checks for
        disabled children have been part of the SSI program since
        it started in 1974. </p>
        <p>SSI money comes from general federal revenues, not the
        Social Security trust fund. </p>
        <p>Childhood disability was a relatively small part of
        the program until 1990 when a U.S. Supreme Court decision
        led to an explosion of claims. </p>
        <p>In that case, Sullivan v. Zebley, the court opened the
        way for children with behavioral disorders to qualify for
        SSI. </p>
        <p>''That essentially said Social Security had to broaden
        its definition of disability for children,'' Margenau
        said. </p>
        <p>And broaden it did. Before the Zebley decision, there
        were about 300,000 childhood SSI cases; in the past six
        years, that's grown to 1 million. </p>
        <p>McCook said the ruling gave incentives for parents to
        have children with marginal disabilities labeled. </p>
        <p>''I don't think there's any question that if money
        were available to people out there if all of a sudden
        they met a set of conditions, there would be people who
        would try to meet the set of conditions in order to get
        the money,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Not everyone has done it for the check; SSI also
        qualifies recipients for TennCare health insurance. </p>
        <p>''I know a woman who just was approved, and the only
        reason she wanted it was she couldn't afford health
        insurance,'' said Barbara Wagner, president of the
        Learning Disabilities Association of East Tennessee. </p>
        <p><strong>Making it harder </strong></p>
        <p>Margenau said the idea behind childhood SSI is that
        families with disabled children have extra expenses. But
        in many ADD cases, the only expense is medication. </p>
        <p>Even when there are other needs related to the
        disability, Christiansen said parents don't always use
        the SSI money to pay for them. </p>
        <p>''It bothers me when I see a child and say, 'This
        child needs some counseling,' and (the parents) say, 'We
        don't have the money for that,' '' Christiansen said.
        ''Well, aren't you getting that check?'' </p>
        <p>She added: ''I think that somebody ought to make a
        decision on what is the purpose of those funds.'' </p>
        <p>Wagner agreed. She said in some cases parents have
        gotten large retroactive checks because their children
        could have qualified for SSI earlier, and the money has
        been spent on luxuries rather than necessities. </p>
        <p>''I like the idea of forcing (parents) into putting
        this money into an account to pay for what the child
        needs,'' she said. </p>
        <p>That's one of the things the new Social Security
        guidelines do, at least for retroactive payments. </p>
        <p>The changes are part of the federal welfare reform
        bill Congress approved last summer. </p>
        <p>They require re-evaluations for all children
        collecting SSI for behavioral problems. Margenau said
        affected families will receive notification in February
        or March. </p>
        <p>To qualify as disabled, students will have to undergo
        a medical examination that shows their problems create
        ''marked and severe functional limitations.'' </p>
        <p>That's stricter than the current requirements,
        according to Carroll Moore, director of the Disability
        Determination Section in Nashville, which assesses
        disability claims. </p>
        <p>Moore said many claims have been approved on the basis
        of testimony from school psychologists and teachers. Now,
        applicants will need more extensive medical information. </p>
        <p>Margenau said the Social Security Administration
        estimates 260,000 of the 1 million children on SSI will
        be re-evaluated, and as many as 200,000 could lose their
        benefits. </p>
        <p>With average monthly payments of about $424, that
        could save the federal government more than $1 billion a
        year. </p>
        <p>Moreover, McCook said, it would take the label of
        ''disabled'' away from many children who might come to
        rely on it as an excuse. </p>
        <p>''Once they leave school, they're going to be in a
        society where the same rules and regulations apply across
        the board,'' he said. ''The traffic officer is not going
        to ask you, 'Were you taking Ritalin?' '' </p>

        <p>Maximus subcontracted with area agencies to do case
        management -- to interview clients individually, refer
        them to treatment and track their progress in treatment. </p>
        <p>The firm handled 135,000 cases nationwide and 9,700 in
        Tennessee. It closed 98,700 cases, including 7,000 in
        Tennessee, for non-compliance, death or successful
        completion of treatment. </p>
        <p>''To the extent the program was successful, it was
        successful because there was a sanction, because there
        was a motivating factor to the client to remain in
        treatment,'' said Bob Muzzio, project director for
        Maximus. </p>
        <p>Exactly what efforts will be made to get people into
        treatment if they start collecting disability for another
        ailment remains unclear. </p>
        <p>''If the law made sense to start with, it still makes
        sense regardless of whether they've been certified for a
        different problem or not,'' Muzzio said. ''The
        substance-abuse problem is still going to be there.'' </p>
        <p>State and local officials said they've heard more
        treatment money is coming -- the state Bureau of Alcohol
        and Drug Abuse Services has been told informally it could
        expect an extra $827,000 -- but details are sketchy. </p>
        <p>''We don't know specifically what we're going to do as
        yet,'' said Dr. Stephanie Perry, the assistant state
        health commissioner who runs the bureau. </p>
        <p>''We don't have a clear-cut answer in terms of the
        amount of money as yet. We anticipate that we'll have to
        get analysis of the numbers of individuals involved and
        determine what the need for treatment will be for those
        individuals. We will probably have to go through an
        educational process . . . reaching out to these
        individuals.'' </p>
        <p>That puts the burden on local providers, and working
        together will be important. </p>
        <p>''Those folks will just start showing up in other
        systems, not only our own, but in the emergency room and
        in the jail and in different places like that, to access
        resources,'' said Jon Michael, deputy director of
        DRI-Dock, which runs Knoxville's public inebriate
        program. </p>
        <p>''Until we get to a place where we can work together
        and find some coordinated, logical means of dealing with
        folks so that we know what's going on elsewhere in the
        community so everyone is approaching the problem and
        singing from the same sheet, we're probably going to be
        wasting our money to some degree.'' </p>
        <p>TennCare Partners, which provides health coverage for
        mental problems and substance abuse, may pick up some
        clients, although Taylor said in-patient care is
        ''virtually impossible to get.'' </p>
        <p>''The expectation for most (addicts) is that they can
        do it through an outpatient program,'' Taylor said. ''But
        we've learned through treatment that an effective
        in-patient treatment program requires at least a 30-day
        hospitalization and then intensive after care with
        halfway house service for another six months.'' </p>
        <p>The Knoxville Coalition for the Homeless plans to ask
        the Red Cross to help set up extra shelter facilities at
        a church, Taylor said, in anticipation of those who lose
        their housing when their checks stop. </p>
        <p>''In a sense, government created its own problem, as
        it so regularly does, by developing the whole system'' of
        giving drug and alcohol checks,'' Taylor said. ''But to
        then just take it away, you're creating a new, different
        problem. It's just going from one problem to another
        problem instead of to a solution.'' </p>

        <p><br>
        <font size="5">A</font>t the Interfaith Health Clinic in
        the 4th and Gill neighborhood, Dr. Rob McDonald and his
        staff see 1,000 or more working poor patients a month who
        don't have health insurance. </p>
        <p>Many adults ask the doctor to give them a physical
        evaluation so they can apply for a federal disability
        check. McDonald says no. </p>
        <p>''I try to point out the importance of working and
        being productive because a lot of people I know who are
        on disability wind up becoming quite frustrated and
        depressed, and they don't know why,'' he said. </p>
        <p>''But I think it's because we were meant to work. . .
        . I have told people right to their face, 'I do not like
        disability because of what it does to you.' '' </p>
        <p>There are two kinds of disability checks: Social
        Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), paid to adults who
        have worked but become disabled, and Supplemental
        Security Income (SSI), a welfare program for disabled
        people with little or no work history. </p>
        <p>The Social Security Administration is making changes
        in both programs this year to assure the checks are given
        to people who need them, that they're spent properly and,
        when possible, that they're temporary. </p>
        <p>Starting today, the government no longer will pay
        people for being drug addicts or alcoholics. This summer,
        some children on SSI -- primarily those classified with
        attention deficit disorder or other behavioral
        disabilities -- will face re-evaluations. </p>
        <p>And with 10.8 million Americans drawing $5.1 billion
        in disability checks each month, the agency wants to do
        what it can to be sure people don't draw a check without
        trying to get better. </p>
        <p>Tom Margenau, a spokesman at the Social Security
        Administration's headquarters in Baltimore, said the
        agency is considering proposals to get more people off
        disability and back to work. </p>
        <p>''We've frankly stated that we haven't done a very
        good job of that in the past, and the statistics bear
        that out,'' he said. </p>
        <p>Will to work? </p>
        <p>Margenau said only 1 to 2 percent of people approved
        for disability leave the program because they find
        full-time work. </p>
        <p>In many cases, people are permanently disabled and
        unemployable. </p>
        <p>But officials think a lot of people currently on
        disability could be retrained for work if they're
        willing. </p>
        <p>''If they're interested, we will take them,'' said
        Bruce Brown, a field director for the state's Vocational
        Rehabilitation program. ''But 'if they're interested' is
        the $64,000 question. A lot of times they're not.'' </p>
        <p>Jim Rovere, Social Security district manager for Knox,
        Loudon, Sevier and Union counties, said his office refers
        disability applicants to Vocational Rehabilitation if
        there's a chance they can be retrained. </p>
        <p>He said many people with physical disabilities can no
        longer do manual labor but could learn other less
        strenuous skills. </p>
        <p>People on SSDI can have trial work periods of up to
        nine months during which they still receive their
        disability checks. </p>
        <p>If they are able to keep ''substantial employment''
        after nine months, the disability checks stop. </p>
        <p>But Brown said many people referred to Vocational
        Rehabilitation don't participate. He said counselors
        contact each person at least twice to offer their
        services. </p>
        <p>''Since we're completely a voluntary program, a person
        has to want our services before we provide them,'' he
        said. </p>
        <p>Last year in the entire state, Vocational
        Rehabilitation offices found full-time employment for
        just 186 people from SSI or SSDI programs, according to
        state officials. </p>
        <p>That's not to say other people on disability don't
        work. James Farr, a Social Security fraud investigator,
        said he often finds people working and not reporting it
        so they can keep their disability checks. </p>
        <p>They sometimes get caught only because they get cocky.
        </p>
        <p>''Sometimes it's a disgruntled spouse or relative,''
        Farr said. ''It could be someone working with that
        person, and they're bragging about how they're ripping
        off the government.'' </p>
        <p>Community approach </p>
        <p>Margenau said the Social Security Administration is
        looking at a number of ways to get more disabled people
        to try working. </p>
        <p>For one thing, the agency wants to raise awareness of
        the trial work period. </p>
        <p>''(People) are afraid that if they go to work, they'll
        automatically lose their benefits,'' Margenau said. </p>
        <p>Also, the adminstration recently put out a request for
        proposals to coordinate resources in communities to
        encourage retraining and re-employment. </p>
        <p>One of the companies offering a bid is Maximus, a
        for-profit social-services agency based in Virginia.
        Maximus has worked for Social Security before, most
        recently monitoring the discontinued drug and alcohol
        disability program. </p>
        <p>''We would come up with a nationwide list of clients
        who are receiving these (disability) benefits and who
        could benefit from vocational rehabilitation services,
        and then subcontractors would sign up to work with
        them,'' said Bob Muzzio, project director for Maximus. </p>
        <p>''We think that has a lot of potential because . . .
        it's trying to get people who are on disability into the
        work force. The focus would be not so much on reassessing
        (medical conditions) as on finding skills that would
        match the disability.'' </p>
        <p>Muzzio said Maximus has been successful with a similar
        program in northern Virginia which matched up welfare
        recipients with agencies that can help them find
        employment. </p>
        <p>''We've placed so many clients that we don't have any
        clients left on welfare rolls,'' he said. </p>
        <p>In addition to the money saved by putting more
        disabled people to work, Brown said a more aggressive
        rehabilitation program would lift the self-esteem of
        those receiving the checks. </p>
        <p>''Someone once said the best therapy is a job. That's
        not our official motto, but it's really true,'' Brown
        said. ''People can have a physical disability of some
        sort that they're eligible (for payments) on, but the
        real disability would be just feeling so bad about
        themselves.'' </p>

<!--SUBHEAD-->        <p><font size="2"><i>By Ina Hughs News-Sentinel Columnist</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><!--dateline--></font><br>
        <font size="5">T</font>he other night a bunch of local
        writers from the Knoxville Writers Guild were talking and
        someone pointed out how several News-Sentinel columnists
        had written recently on the same subject -- namely, how
        and why and what they do. ''The craft of writing,'' as it
        is sometimes called. </p>
        <p>And it's true. </p>
        <p>David Hunter, Don Williams, Harold Julian and Wilma
        Dykeman have all done personal pieces about writing in
        general and/or how they go about selecting and
        pasteurizing their ideas into print. </p>
        <p>I have enjoyed these columns, and my guess is their
        readers have, too. We all wish we could be as sensitive
        as Hunter, as scholarly as Williams, as easy-to-read as
        Dykeman and as nice a guy as Julian. </p>
        <p>Folks in charge of the University of Tennessee's
        Non-Credit programs tell me that writing classes are
        among the first to fill up. People are reviving the art
        of storytelling. We realize more and more how important
        memory is, and that its survival -- and therefore ours as
        a person, a family, a culture -- depends on making that
        voyage from out of the head and onto the page. </p>
        <p>Computers have taken the drudgery -- well, some of it
        -- out of getting our stories and our thoughts written
        out. As someone once put it, ''I love to write. It's the
        paperwork I can't stand.'' </p>
        <p>Word processors make our brains more user-friendly. </p>
        <p>My philosophy about writing in general and my writing
        in particular is pretty simple: </p>
        <p>To you I give my stories. From you I would like your
        story so that together we can know our story. Because it
        is only by sharing our stories that we will ever
        understand the story. </p>
        <p>A little grandiose and touchy-feely, I realize, but
        it's a serious (and impossible) responsibility to come up
        with words worth reading three times a week, rain or
        shine. </p>
        <p>It gives me the willies just to think about what
        Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Edna Buchanan said
        about writing for a newspaper: ''The best day is when I
        can write a lead that will cause a reader at his
        breakfast table the next morning to spit up his coffee,
        clutch his heart and shout, 'My God! Martha, did you read
        this?' . . . '' </p>
        <p>But if the truth be known -- columnists get more
        sympathy than they deserve. We just get paid for doing
        what you do all day: think, talk, replay something that
        happened, blow off steam, tell a joke, recall a story,
        pass on information, revisit an event, gossip, beg, pray,
        improvise, shoot off our mouth, brag on our kids, play
        politics, sidewalk supervise, complain, critique, make
        fools of ourselves, think out loud . . . </p>
        <p>Instead of doing it around the water fountain or in
        the den recliner, we do it at our desks on deadline. And
        we have to spell it correctly. </p>
        <p>Although I have to admit: In my darker moments, I
        think of columnists as people who sit down at the
        computer and open a vein -- a thought, by the way, which
        is not original. I just forgot which writer said it. </p>
        <p>For me the worst occupational hazard I face is having
        anyone think I see myself as having special insights or
        to assume that the windows of my mind are slammed shut as
        soon as I form an opinion or finish my spiel. To me the
        most important tool a columnist has is not her computer
        or her press releases or even her mind. It's her heart. </p>
        <p>O.K. Enough of that. </p>
        <p>Which brings me to the only other point I want to make
        in this navel-gazing exercise. </p>
        <p>Deadline writing for a newspaper has its advantages.
        If you write something good, you can't get too excited or
        carried away because you have to do it again the next
        day. If you write something not-so-good, you needn't jump
        off a cliff or wear a bag over your head because you get
        another chance. Real soon. </p>
        <p>Either way, you can't take yourself too seriously
        because, good or bad, everyone wraps up their garbage in
        it anyway. </p>
        <p>O.K., Sam. Your turn. </p>

<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here-->        <font size="5">I</font>'ve been out on the World Wide
        Web. </p>
        <p>After three years of having had access to the
        electronic highway, I finally went down some back roads.
        Not all of those roads lead to the city of Oz. </p>
        <p>For the most part, I had limited myself to a browsing
        program; you type in a subject or associated word, and
        the browser hunts down references. For instance, when I
        was working on a column about pain, there were over
        240,000 references. </p>
        <p>My daughter Kristi went looking for information on
        Melungeons, a once-mysterious ethnic group (from which
        she and I are probably descended) living in areas of
        Appalachia when the French arrived in the 18th century.
        She filled several pages. </p>
        <p>Ditto for werewolves; while doing research for a
        mystery novel, I found scientific studies,
        quasi-scientific studies, folklore and people who
        believed themselves to be werewolves. </p>
        <p>Recently, I explored an area called news groups. The
        name is misleading. The news groups are places where
        people with similar interests can send and receive
        pictures and articles. There are groups devoted to every
        imaginable subject from science to God. </p>
        <p>As I scrolled through the news groups, I found a
        series dedicated to sexual fetishes. The fetishes were
        broken down into specialties such as: wife-swapping,
        amputees, fat, tickling, water sports, bestiality,
        pedophilia and some others I was not sophisticated enough
        to recognize. </p>
        <p>I already knew from years on the streets that human
        sexuality takes many forms. Still, it's one thing to know
        it and another thing to see devotees of different
        fetishes practicing their preference in living color or
        black-and-white. </p>
        <p>Many of the posted items are commercial ads, enticing
        people to order videos or CD-Rom disks. A lot, however,
        are personal photos that people share with like-minded
        individuals. It is now simple to make pictures with a
        camcorder or digital camera and convert them to something
        called text files that can be transmitted and decoded at
        the other end. </p>
        <p>What I found on the back roads of the information
        highway reminded me that it is essential to teach
        children what they need to know as they are growing up;
        in this day of fatal sexual encounters, anyone who can't
        talk about sex to their children had better hope that
        there are teachers who can and will. </p>
        <p>My teenage son surfs the Internet and drives on the
        roads of Tennessee. I am much more afraid of the
        automobile than of anything he might see or read. He has
        always been able to ask his parents about anything. My
        wife and I have been frank with our children about sexual
        matters; we have viewed honesty about such things as our
        duty. </p>
        <p>There are computer programs available to block out
        access to certain words or subject matter, but a curious
        and technologically savvy kid with a computer can get
        around any obstacle. </p>
        <p>When my children were small, I could watch them
        closely. My police weapons were kept out of their reach
        until they were tall enough to get to them. Then I sat
        them down and explained in graphic detail what a bullet
        does to the human body. None of them ever tampered with
        the tools of my trade. </p>
        <p>Like all powerful human inventions -- drugs,
        photography, printing, nuclear energy, gunpowder -- the
        Internet is a mixed blessing. It can be a tool of
        knowledge or a window into perversity. How it's used will
        pretty much depend on how a youngster has been raised. </p>
        <p>And anyone who thinks knowledge is more dangerous than
        ignorance had better think again. </p>

        Hunter's newest collection is all his own</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><i>By Fred Brown, News-Sentinel staff
        writer</i></font></p>
        <p>He says it so cleanly, almost as if the words were
        shaped by a hand tool: When you can be brief and
        descriptive at the same time, you have a writer. </p>
        <p>He says it from experience: Write what you know. </p>
        <p>And he says it in practice: By writing short,
        descriptive sentences that are elegant and rich in color. </p>
        <p>David Hunter, 49, is a full-time writer. Once, he was
        a full-time sheriff's deputy who also happened to be a
        writer. Today, after being forced to retire because of an
        ailing heart, he is an author who writes about the men and
        women who protect us from our own worst natures. </p>
        <p>And also today, David Hunter stands at the pinnacle of
        what he always wanted to be: The warrior-poet. He is an
        effortless storyteller, who begins and ends a story with
        ease and grace. He writes like he preaches. </p>
        <p>''Good writing is not a mystical endeavor. It takes a
        whole lot more perspiration than inspiration. Anybody can
        be inspired to write or to tell a story, but that doesn't
        mean anyone is going to read it. Anytime I set down to
        read a book and the author is so clear that what he
        writes appears to be very simple, I know I'm in the
        presence of a master craftsman.'' </p>
        <p>For the past two decades, Hunter has quietly, but
        resolutely, forged a niche for himself as an author with
        a story, as a writer who has something to say. He has
        published five collections of true crime stories, two
        novels and one work in collaboration with Norma Tillman,
        a Nashville private detective. </p>
        <p>Hunter's first collection of stories, ''The Moon Is
        Always Full,'' set the pace and tone for his future
        collections. The book was packed with stories about things
        that happened to him and other police officers. In some
        instances, he changed the names. The stories, however,
        remained true to fact. </p>
        <p>He recently finished his latest collection of crime
        stories, ''The Archangel Caper,'' with a new twist. </p>
        <p>Although the stories demonstrate the unmistakable
        Hunter storytelling touch, the book is his creation all
        the way. Even his 16-year-old son, Paris, got in on the
        job by designing the attractive cover. </p>
        <p>Hunter, who is also a News-Sentinel columnist, joined
        with another News-Sentinel columnist, Don Williams, to
        create Tin Star Publishing. </p>
        <p>The two writers began with Hunter's latest work as the
        company's first venture strictly out of a sense of
        business: David Hunter's books sell. Over the years he
        has created a following that borders on cult devotion. He
        has readers from across the nation as well as fans spread
        throughout Europe. </p>
        <p>The following is so loyal, they send him old
        typewriters, which he collects. </p>
        <p>Hunter and Williams are banking on the noted author's
        appeal to launch the new publishing venture. So far, it
        is working. The book, just out, is about to break even,
        Hunter says. </p>
        <p>Hunter went from seeing policeman as part of the
        problem to being one of them. He once thought of law
        officers as evil necessities. That, he says with a smile,
        was back in his radical days. </p>
        <p>The rad days are behind him, but Hunter comes at
        writing in much the same way he did his activism, or his
        time as a policeman. He attacks. He is voracious. There
        is no mercy. </p>
        <p>He is committed. </p>
        <p>From 1980 until 1993, Hunter cruised the rough streets
        and roads of Knox County with a badge and a gun. He is
        quick to tell you that those were the tools of his trade,
        and he was an enthusiastic officer of the law. He loved being
        a cop, hauling in the bad guys. He enjoyed helping people
        in distress. He relished putting the handcuffs on evil. </p>
        <p>David Hunter was the warrior by night and the poet by
        day, writing, getting down his feelings, putting down the
        street stories. He was trying to understand the people
        with whom he worked, while at the same time following a
        high calling to keep the peace. </p>
        <p>Those diverse points have shaped him as much as
        anything. He hated leaving police work. It almost
        destroyed him, but he returned from that personal abyss
        to understand that writing was his last best calling. </p>
        <p>''Even today I think policemen are the most
        fascinating people I know,'' Hunter says while relaxing
        in his kitchen. His dog, Maxie, an expensive German
        Shepherd, wanders in with a ball in her mouth. She is
        family, Hunter says. </p>
        <p>''Policemen put their lives up for collateral every
        night. You can't talk a good game out there. You either
        do or you don't. I saw irony in abundance in police work.
        Cops are deductive thinkers, but the best also listen to
        their hunches.'' </p>
        <p>From 1979-88, he had been working and writing. It was
        good that he kept his day job, for the writing was not
        producing much results. In 1988, he began to write his
        hunches. And they have paid off. </p>
        <p>''I thought of myself as a novelist.'' </p>
        <p>That wasn't working. Then he began writing the real
        stories. He sent them off to one publisher, who turned
        them down. </p>
        <p>But Rutledge Hill Publishing in Nashville, which was
        just starting out then, said it wanted to see all of the
        stuff. </p>
        <p>The rest is history. David Hunter was launched like a
        rocket. </p>
        <p>The Nashville company published one of his novels and
        then another collection of short stories. In all,
        Rutledge Hill has published seven of his nine books. </p>
        <p>And now, he has finished one volume of an
        autobiography, also by Rutledge Hill. He says the
        autobiography became necessary because of his health
        problems. </p>
        <p>''I may not have started soon enough,'' is the way he
        puts it. He has two more volumes planned in the
        autobiographical series. </p>
        <p>The autobiography, (the first volume entitled
        ''Trailer Trash''), is about his days growing up in a
        poor section of Knoxville. Like many good writers, Hunter's
        childhood became the fuel of his pen. </p>
        <p>''I lived at the end of the line, where street cars
        turned around. It was a neighborhood full of colorful
        characters. Central Avenue back then was the only place
        in Knoxville where whites and blacks commonly mingled.
        What we had in common is that we were all poor.'' </p>
        <p>The present scene of Old City as hip-hop hangout for
        trend chasers, produces a semi-snarl-slash-smile on
        Hunter's face. </p>
        <p>''Old City today is a ghost town,'' he says. </p>
        <p>''That place had a large effect on me. You could find
        anything you wanted on Central Avenue. From
        paint-thinner, which the winos drank, to the best hot
        dogs in the world.'' </p>
        <p>Using his past as resource, David Hunter is carrying
        on that rich tradition of Knoxville writers -- from Agee
        to Madden to McCarthy to Giovanni -- who have found the
        voice of their home and their region. </p>
        <p>Hunter will sign his new book, ''The Archangel
        Caper,'' Saturday, Nov. 16, at Bookland in Maryville from
        12 noon to 2 p.m. and Sunday, Nov. 17 at Book Warehouse
        in Knoxville from 1 p.m.-3 p.m. and at Book Warehouse in
        Maryville from 4:30 p.m.-6 p.m. </p>
        <p>He will also read from the new work at the November
        meeting of the Knoxville Writers' Guild at 7 p.m. at The
        Laurel Theater, 1538 Laurel Ave. on the University of
        Tennessee campus. </p>

        <font size="5">N</font>otes and quotes on news of the
        day: </p>
        <p>1 * Back in 1995, when President Clinton loaned Mexico
        $20 billion to avert an economic crisis in that country,
        his critics were furious. You may recall that former
        presidential candidate Pat Buchanan termed it ''daylight
        robbery of the nation's wealth'' and said this was money
        ''American taxpayers will never see again.'' </p>
        <p>But a funny thing happened on the way to ruination.
        Last week, Mexico paid off the debt -- three years ahead
        of schedule -- along with $580 million in interest. </p>
        <p>Yes, children. For once in his life, Uncle Sam entered
        into a financial agreement and actually made money. You
        know, like a bank does it. </p>
        <p>How odd if this silly notion took root and flourished
        in Washington. </p>
        <p>Worry not. Congress will make certain such foolishness
        never gets out of hand. </p>
        <p>* Another fund-raiser: Mayhaps we should follow the
        lead of courts in Turkey. </p>
        <p>A judge in Ankara recently levied a $20,000 fine
        against Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller for slandering
        Justice Minister Sevket Kazan. According to testimony,
        Ciller was giving a speech and said Kazan was ''without
        honor or national pride.'' This, the court ruled, was an
        insult worthy of the huge fine. </p>
        <p>Imagine the flow of cash in America if that same
        standard was applied every time our politicians got in
        front of a microphone and ripped each other. Poof! No
        national debt. </p>
        <p>* You probably haven't seen evidence of it yet, but
        the Coca-Cola company is changing the design on one of
        its leading products. </p>
        <p>According to the Associated Press, the company has
        erased the vertical white ribbon on cans of Classic Coke
        and altered the wording design. The Coca-Cola logo will
        now be almost horizontal instead of vertical. </p>
        <p>The new look has been introduced in Chicago, New York,
        Atlanta and other cities. You should see changes
        elsewhere within two months. </p>
        <p>This is being done without any hint of fanfare. With
        good reason. After that New Coke disaster, the word
        ''change'' has presumably been deleted from Coca-Cola's
        corporate vocabulary. </p>
        <p>* And speaking of headaches in the ol' boardroom, I
        can only imagine the marketing experts at Burger King are
        rethinking -- again -- their latest advertising campaign.
        </p>
        <p>You remember Burger King's old ''Have it your way''
        appeal? </p>
        <p>That's apparently what Carl Berthelot had in mind when
        he entered a Burger King in Gonzales, La., and ordered a
        hamburger without onions. </p>
        <p>He got onions. </p>
        <p>According to police reports, Berthelot confronted the
        manager. A food fight erupted. And before you could say,
        ''Hold the pickle, hold the lettuce, special orders don't
        upset us,'' Berthelot threw a punch and busted the
        manager's glasses. He was booked on charges of battery
        and disturbing the peace. </p>
        <p>Guess what Burger King's current slogan is? </p>
        <p>Yep, that's right. ''Double vision.'' </p>
        <p>* It's a good thing Leonso Canales lives in Texas
        instead of Tennessee. </p>
        <p>As you may have read in your favorite morning
        newspaper a few days ago, Canales is the 56-year-old flea
        market operator who convinced Kleberg County
        commissioners to adopt a new official courthouse greeting
        in his hometown of Kingsville. </p>
        <p>Canales was bothered by the fact that ''hello''
        contains the word ''hell.'' He launched a three-year
        campaign to purge the word and replace it with
        ''heaveno'' as a symbol of ''peace, friendship and
        welcome'' in the current ''age of anxiety.'' </p>
        <p>Imagine the anxiety Canales would experience if he
        moved to East Tennessee and discovered a language riddled
        daily with nasty expressions like ''Douglas Dam,''
        ''Norris Dam,'' ''Watts Bar Dam'' and a few dozen more
        ''dams.'' </p>
        <p>Do you suppose we should be calling them ''darns,''
        ''dangs'' or ''durns?'' </p>
        <p>I'll be da-, er, I mean, uh -- helifino. </p>

<h1>Add Us As A Bookmark</h1>

<p>All Web browsers we know of give you the option to add a site
to a list of bookmarks or favorite places you want to re-visit.
We hope you'll put The Knoxville News-Sentinel Online on your
list. Bookmark our homepage, whose Uniform resource Locator, or
URL, is <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/">http://www.knoxnews.com/</a>.
If you haven't already bookmark us by following this link and
doing one of the things below. </p>

<p><b>Netscape Navigator</b> calls these <em>bookmarks</em>. To
add The Knoxville News-Sentinel Online as a bookmark, go under
the top menu item <strong>Bookmarks</strong>, then select the
option to <strong>Add Bookmark</strong>. No sweat. It will set a
bookmark to whatever document you are viewing when the <strong>Add
Bookmark</strong> command is made. Do it while you're on our main
page. </p>

<p>To use the bookmark, select the bookmark directly from the <strong>Bookmarks</strong>
menu.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Microsoft Internet Explorer</b> calls them <em>Favorites</em>.
Click on <strong>Favorites</strong> then click on <strong>Add to
Favorites</strong>. Like Netscape, you need to have the page you
want to add to your list of favorite sites on the screen when you
add it. Nothing to it. </p>

<p><b>Lynx</b> calls them <em>bookmarks</em>. To add The
Knoxville News-Sentinel as a bookmark, type <kbd>'a'</kbd> (for <strong>add
bookmark</strong>) and then type <kbd>'d'</kbd> (saving the <strong>document</strong>
to a bookmark file). It's that simple. Remember, it will set a
bookmark to whatever document you are viewing when you save the
bookmark. </p>

<p>To use the bookmark, simply type <kbd>'v'</kbd> (for <strong>view
bookmarks</strong>) and, using the up/down arrow or tab keys if
necessary, move to Knoxville News-Sentinel Online and hit return
or enter.</p>

        fashion, and portraits give the staff of eight -- J.Miles
        Cary, Michael Patrick, Paul Efird, Clay Owen, Byron
        Small, Margaret Bentlage, Joe Howell, and Director of
        Photography Jack Kirkland -- a wide array of subject

        face="Arial,Helvetica,Frutiger">&quot;I think we have one
        of the finest staffs of any newspaper our size. I enjoy
        working with each and every one of my photographers, and
        I am proud to see the quality of work they turn in on a
        daily basis. Our photographers receive regional and
        national recognition for their work, but more importantly
        they do an excellent job of visual reporting, which
        primarily benefits The News-Sentinel readers,&quot; says
        Jack Kirkland.<br>
        <br>
        Kirkland estimates his staff uses about 7,000 rolls of
        film each year. They drive and fly more than 200,000
        miles on News-Sentinel assignments. The newspaper equips
        each photographer with three Nikon cameras and an
        assortment of Nikkor lenses. &quot;This is absolutely the
        best job in the world,&quot; says Michael Patrick who is
        one of the senior photographers on staff. He has worked
        for The News-Sentinel for more than 17 years. Today, we
        pay tribute to the art and skill of News-Sentinel
        photojournalists by displaying photos on this page which
        each of them have chosen as examples of their best work
        for 1996.</font></p>

<h1>Sign Our Guest Book And You Might 
Win A Free Book!</h1>
<p>We know these guest books are a pain so we decided to make it a little fun. Each week (YES, 
week!), we'll be giving away a copy of <i>Tennessee / A Celebration of 150 Years of the 
University</i>.</p>
<p>This 128 page glossy book was published in 1994 by Scripps Howard Publishing. The text was 
written by Betsy B. Creekmore and the introduction was written by News-Sentinel columnist Sam 
Venable.</p>
<p>It contains lots of wonderful UT related photos. Heck, seeing what media meteor Chris Whittle 
(remember him?) looked like in 1967 is worth registering to get a shot at winning a book. We'll 
randomly choose the winner each Monday and post their name here. Of course, no purchase is 
necessary to enter. We've made the form as short as possible so you need to fill out all the blanks 
so we can get the book to you if you win. </p>
<p>This week's (1/13/97) winner is <font size=4>Glann Leen</font> of Max Meadows, VA. Way to go Glann! </p>

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><FONT SIZE="+2">I</FONT>t&#39;s a good time of year for hot soup. At Historic Rugby curried tomato soup is a special of Harrow Road Cafe.
<P>   The soup was served at a special Christmas program, and it&#39;s on the menu occasionally as one of the soup specials at the restaurant owned and operated by Historic Rugby.
<P>   Harrow Road Cafe is open for breakfast and lunch, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., seven days a week (weather permitting) through the end of February. Beginning March 1, Harrow Road Cafe will be open 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. (For information, call Historic Rugby, 1-423-628-2441.) 
<P>
<P>Curried tomato soup
<P>
<P>
<P>   1 cup chopped onion
<P>   1 cup chopped green 
<P>
<P>
<P>   Saute onion and green pepper in butter over medium heat until onion is transparent. Do not brown!

		<!--Connections 32 with WebDesk Inserts Story Text Here--><P>   <B>A.</B> The recently released Surgeon General&#39;s report on physical activity and health made it clear a sedentary lifestyle is damaging the health of Americans and is a major factor for the growing obesity problem in this country.
<P>   What&#39;s being recommended is you don&#39;t have to do all your exercising at one time. Everyone can substantially improve their health and quality of life by accumulating 30 minutes or more of physical activity daily.
<P>   Instead of taking a traditional exercise break, park your car further away from the door, and walk (no strolling) around the building before entering. During the day take your breaks to walk up and down the stairs.
<P>   If you can set aside 30 minutes daily for a brisk walk, you can burn at least 100 calories -- which once a day is 3,000 calories a month, which is almost one pound. 
<P>   Over a year that&#39;s more than 10 pounds.

<P>
<P>   Washington&#39;s Willard Inter-Continental is featuring presidential cuisine in The Willard Room through Monday, Jan. 20, to celebrate the upcoming inauguration. The bi-partisan menu, available at dinner only, was developed from historic White House cookbooks, according to Ann McCracken of the hotel&#39;s public relations department.
<P>   The cover of the menu is historic, too. The hotel&#39;s archives contained an old menu depicting an etching of President Abraham Lincoln viewing his inaugural parade from the old Willard in 1861.
<P>   Price range for dinner items varies from $7.50 to $9.50 for appetizers, $25.50 to $27 for entrees and $6.75 for dessert.
<P>    The Jockey Club in The Ritz-Carlton in Washington also is planning an inauguration menu through Wednesday, Jan. 22. Executive chef Hidemasa Yamamoto created the menu, inspired by the official inaugural luncheon served on Capitol Hill since President Kennedy&#39;s 1961 swearing-in. The Jockey Club opened on the eve of the Kennedy inauguration.
<P>   The three-course menu is $35 for lunch; $50 for dinner.
<P>
<P><B>Cooking classes</B>
