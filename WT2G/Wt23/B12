<H1><CENTER>Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion</H1>

<H2>First International Conference <br>on Health Promotion
<BR>
Ottawa, Canada, 17-21 November 1986</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<H3>Health Promotion</H3>


Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase
control over, and to improve, their health. To reach a state of
complete physical mental and social wellbeing, an individual or
group must be able to identify and to realize aspirations, to
satisfy needs, and to change or cope with the environment. Health
is, therefore, seen as a resource fo everyday life, not the objective
of living. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and
personal resources, as well as physical capacities. Therefore,
health promotion is not just the responsibility of the health
sector, but goes beyond healthy lifestyles to wellbeing.
<H4>Prerequisites for health</H4>

<P>
The fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace,
shelter, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem, sustainable
resources, social justice and equity. Improvement in health requires
a secure foundation in these basic prerequisites.
<H4>Advocate</H4>


Good health is a major resource for social, economic and personal
development and an important dimension of quality of life. Political,
economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioural and biological
factors can all favour health or be harmful to it. Health promotion
action aims at making these conditions favourable through advocacy for health.
<H4>Enable</H4>


Health promotion focuses on achieving equity in health. Health
promotion action aims at reducing differences in current health
status and ensuring equal opportunities and resources to enable
all people to achieve their fullest health potential. This includes
a secure foundation in a supportive environment, access to information,
life skills and opportunities for making healthy choices. People
cannot achieve their fullest health potential unless they are
able to take control of those things which determine their health.
This must apply equally to women and men.
<H4>Mediate</H4>


The prerequisites and prospects for health cannot be ensured by
the health sector alone. More importantly, health promotion demands
coordinated action by all concerned: by<FONT SIZE=4> </FONT>governments,
by health and other social and economic sectors, by nongoverwnental
and voluntary organizations, by local authorities, by industry
and by the media. People in all walks of life are involved as
individuals, families and communities. Professional and social
groups and health personnel have a major responsibility to mediate
between differing interests in society for the pursuit of
health.
<P>
Health promotion strategies and programmes should be adapted to
the local needs and possibilities of individual countries and
regions to take into account differing social, cultural and economic
systems.
<H3>Health Promotion Action Means</H3>

<H4>Build healthy public policy</H4>


Health promotion goes beyond health care. It puts health on the
agenda of policy-makers in all sectors and at all levels, directing
them to be aware of the health consequences of their decisions
and to accept their responsibilities for health.
<P>
Health promotion policy combines diverse but complementary approaches
including legislation, fiscal measures, taxation and organizational
change. It is coordinated action that leads to health, income
and social policies that foster greater equity. Joint action contributes
to ensuring safer and healthier goods and services, healthier
public services, and cleaner, more enjoyable environments.
<P>
Health promotion policy requires the identification of obstacles
to the adoption of healthy public policies in non-health sectors,
and ways of removing them. The aim must be to make the healthier
choice the easier choice for policy-makers as well.
<H4>Create supportive environments</H4>


Our societies are complex and interrelated. Health cannot be separated
from other goals. The inextricable links between people and their
environment constitute the basis for a socioecological approach
to health. The overall guiding principle for the world, nations,
regions and communities alike is the need to encourage reciprocal
maintenance - to take care of each other, our communities and
our natural environment. The conservation of natural resources
throughout the world should be emphasized as a global responsibility.
<P>
Changing patterns of life, work and leisure have a significant
impact on health. Work and leisure should be a source of health
for people. The way society organizes work should help create
a healthy society. Health promotion generates living and working
conditions that are safe, stimulating, satisfying and enjoyable.
<P>
Systematic assessment of the health impact of a rapidly changing
environment - particularly in areas of technology, work, energy
production and urbanization - is essential and must be followed
by action to ensure positive benefit to the health of the public.
The protection of the natural and built environments and the conservation
of natural resources must be addressed in any health promotion
strategy.
<H4>Strengthen community action</H4>


Health promotion works through concrete and effective community
action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning strategies
and implementing them to achieve better health. At the heart of
this process is the empowerment of communities, their ownership
and control of their own endeavours and destinies.
<P>
Community development draws on existing human and material resources
in the community to enhance self-help and social support, and
to develop flexible systems for<FONT SIZE=4> strengthening public
</FONT>participation and direction of health matters. This requires
full and continuous access to information, learning opportunities
for health, as well as funding support.
<H4>Develop personal skills</H4>


Health promotion supports personal and social development through
providing information, education for health and enhancing life
skills. By so doing, it increases the options available to people
to exercise more control over their own health and over their
environments, and to make choices conducive to health.
<P>
Enabling people to learn throughout life, to prepare themselves
for all of its stages and to cope with chronic illness and injuries
is essential. This has to be facilitated in school, home, work
and community settings. Action is required through educational,
professional, commercial and voluntary bodies, and within the
institutions themselves.
<H4>Reorient health services</H4>


The responsibility for health promotion in health services is
shared among individuals, community groups, health professionals,
health service institutions and governments.  They must work together
towards a health care system which contributes to the pursuit
of health.
<P>
The role of the health sector must move increasingly in a health
promotion direction, beyond its responsibility for providing clinical
and curative services. Health services need to embrace an expanded
mandate which is sensitive and respects cultural needs. This mandate
should support the needs of individuals and communities for a
healthier life, and open channels between the health sector and
broader social, political, economic and physical environmental
components.
<P>
Reorienting health services also requires stronger attention to
health research as well as changes in professional education and
training. This must lead to a change of attitude and organization
of health services, which refocuses on the total needs of the
individual as a whole person.
<H3>Moving into the future</H3>

<P>
Health is created and lived by people within the settings of their
everyday life; where they learn, work, play and love. Health is
created by caring for oneself and others, by being able to take
decisions and have control over one's life circumstances, and
by ensuring that the society one lives in creates conditions that
allow the attainment of health by all its members.
<P>
Caring, holism and ecology are essential issues in developing
strategies for health promotion. Therefore, those involved should
take as a guiding principle that, in each phase of planning, implementation
and evaluation of health promotion activities, women and men should
become equal partners.
<H4>Commitment to health promotion</H4>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>The participants in this Conference pledge:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>to move into the arena of healthy public policy, and to advocate
a clear political commitment to health and equity in all sectors;
<LI>to counteract the pressures towards harmful products, resource
depletion, unhealthy living conditions and environments, and bad
nutrition; and to focus attention on public health issues such
as pollution, occupational hazards, housing and settlements;
<LI>to respond to the health gap within and between societies,
and to tackle the inequities in health produced by the rules and
practices of these societies;
<LI>to acknowledge people as the main health resource, to support
and enable them to keep themselves, their families and friends
healthy through financial and other means, and to accept the community
as the essential voice in matters of its health, living conditions
and wellbeing;
<LI>to reorient health services and their resources towards the
promotion of health; and to share power with other sectors, other
disciplines and most importantly with people themselves;
<LI>to recognize health and its maintenance as a major social
investment and challenge; and to address the overall ecological
issue of our ways of living.
</UL>


The Conference urges all concerned to join them in their commitment
to a strong public health alliance.
<H4>Call for international action</H4>


The Conference calls on the World Health Organization and other
international organizations to advocate the promotion of health
in all appropriate forums and to support countries in setting
up strategies and programmes for health promotion.
<P>
The Conference is firmly convinced that if people in all walks
of life, nongovernmental and voluntary organizations, governments,
the World Health Organization and all other bodies concerned join
forces in introducing strategies for health promotion, in line
with the moral and social values that form the basis of this CHARTER,
health for all by the year 2000 will become a reality.

<H1><CENTER>Vienna Declaration on Nursing in Support of the European
Targets
for Health for All</H1>

<H2>European Conference on Nursing, <br>Vienna, Austria,
<BR>
21-24 June 1988</h2></CENTER>
<HR>

The participants at the European Conference
on Nursing, meeting in Vienna from 21 to 24 June 1988, express
the need for urgent action by governments and national health
decision-makers to help nurses make the changes that are required
in nursing if the regional targets for health for all are to be
achieved, and hereby make the following declaration:

<H3>I</h3>
Health, which is a state of complete physical, mental and
social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,
is a fundamental human right. The attainment of the highest possible
level of health is a most important social goal, whose realization
requires the action of many professions.

<H3>II</h3>
The persisting inequalities in people's health status, both
between and within countries of the WHO European Region, are politically,
socially, economically and professionally unacceptable and are
therefore of common concern to all nurses.

<H3>III</h3>
Having provided nurses from the 32 countries in the Region
with their first opportunity to re-examine their role, education
and practice, the Conference reaffirms the status of nursing as
a force that can make a major contribution to achieving the 38
targets adopted by the Member States at the thirty-fourth session
of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe in 1984.

<H3>IV</h3>
The participants pledge to bring the new role of the nurse
in the era of health for all to the attention of ministries of
health, the organizations and trade unions of all health professions,
regulatory bodies and other groups throughout the Region. Nurses
should develop their new&nbsp;role by: acting as partners in decision-making
on the planning and management of local, regional and national
health services; playing a greater role in empowering individuals,
families and communities to become more self-reliant and to take
charge of their health development; and providing clear and valid
information on the favourable and adverse consequences of various
types of behaviour, and on the merits and costs of different options
for care.

<H3>V</h3>
New attitudes and values need to be fostered among all health
professionals, health care consumers and related groups that are
consistent with the directives and principles of health for all
and the primary health care approach. Nursing can best fulfil
its potential in primary health care when nursing education provides
a sound foundation for nursing practice, especially work in the
community, and when nurses take account of the social aspects
of health needs and have a broader understanding of health development.
Policies should be adopted and activities identified to enable
nurses to practise with sufficient autonomy to carry out their
new role in primary health care.</H3>

<H3>VI</h3>
Research to improve nursing practice along these lines should
be encouraged through the creation of research policies and financial
support. Such research should use human resources efficiently,
and ensure the evaluation and use of its results. Nurses should
also be involved in the research process.

<HR>


<H3>Preamble</H3>


In the light of WHO's strategy for health for all in Europe, the
report of the World Commission on Environment and Development
and the related Environmental Perspective to the Year 2000 and
Beyond (resolutions 42/187 and 42/186 of the United Nations General
Assembly) and World Health Assembly resolution WHA42.26,
<UL>
<LI>Recognizing the dependence of human health on a wide range
of crucial environmental factors,
<LI>Stressing the vital importance of preventing health hazards
by protecting the environment,
<LI>Acknowledging the benefits to health and wellbeing that accrue
from a clean and harmonious environment,
<LI>Encouraged by the many examples of positive achievement in
the abatement of pollution and the restoration of a healthy environment,
<LI>Mindful that the maintenance and improvement of health and
wellbeing require a sustainable system of development,
<LI>Concerned at the ill-considered use of natural resources and
man-made products in ways liable to damage the environment and
endanger health,
<LI>Considering the international character of many environmental
and health issues and the interdependence of nations and individuals
in these matters,
<LI>Conscious of the fact that, since developing countries are
faced with major environmental problems, there is a need for global
cooperation,
<LI>Responding to the specific characteristics of the European
Region, and notably its large population, intensive industrialization
and dense traffic,
<LI>Taking into account existing international instruments (such
as agreements on protection of the ozone layer) and other initiatives
relating to the environment and health,
</UL>


The Ministers of the Environment and of Health of the Member States
of the European Region of WHO, meeting together for the first
time at Frankfurt-am-Main on 7 and 8 December 1989, have adopted
the attached European Charter on Environment and Health and have
accordingly agreed upon the principles and strategies laid down
therein as a firm commitment to action. In view of its environmental
mandate, the Commission of the European Communities was specially
invited to participate and, acting on behalf of the Community,
also adopted the Charter as a guideline for future action by the
Community in areas which lie within Community competence.
<H3>Entitlements and responsibilities</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Every individual is entitled to:
<UL>
<LI>an environment conducive to the highest attainable level of
health and wellbeing;
<LI>information and consultation on the state of the environment,
and on plans, decisions and activities likely to affect both the
environment and health;
<LI>participation in the decision-making process.
</UL>

<LI>Every individual has a responsibility to contribute to the
protection of the environment, in the interests of his or her
own health and the health of others.
<LI>All sections of society are responsible for protecting the
environment and health as an intersectoral matter involving many
disciplines; their respective duties should be clarified.
<LI>Every public authority and agency at different levels, in
its daily work, should cooperate with other sectors in order to
resolve problems of the environment and health.
<LI>Every government and public authority has the responsibility
to protect the environment and to promote human health within
the area under its jurisdiction, and to ensure that activities
under its jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to human
health in other states. Furthermore, each shares the common responsibility
for safeguarding the global environment.
<LI>Every public and private body should assess its activities
and carry them out in such a way as to protect people's health
from harmful effects related to the physical, chemical, biological,
microbiological and social environments. Each of these bodies
should be accountable for its actions.
<LI>The media play a key role in promoting awareness and a positive
attitude towards protection of health and the environment. They
are entitled to adequate and accurate information and should be
encouraged to communicate this information effectively to the
public.
<LI>Nongovernmental organizations also play an important role
in disseminating information to the public and promoting public
awareness and response.
</OL>

<H3>Principles for public policy</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Good health and wellbeing require a clean and harmonious environment
in which physical, psychological, social and aesthetic factors
are all given their due importance. The environment should be
regarded as a resource for improving living conditions and increasing
wellbeing.
<LI>2. The preferred approach should be to promote the principle
of &quot;prevention is better than cure&quot;.
<LI>The health of every individual, especially those in vulnerable
and high-risk groups, must be protected. Special attention should
be paid to disadvantaged groups.
<LI>Action on problems of the environment and health should be
based on the best available scientific information.
<LI>New policies, technologies and developments should be introduced
with prudence and not before appropriate prior assessment of the
potential environmental and health impact. There should be a responsibility
to show that they are not harmful to health or the environment.
<LI>The health of individuals and communities should take clear
precedence over considerations of economy and trade.
<LI>All aspects of socioeconomic development that relate to the
impact of the environment on health and wellbeing must be considered.
<LI>The entire flow of chemicals, materials, products and waste
should be managed in such a way as to achieve optimal use of natural
resources and to cause minimal contamination.
<LI>Governments, public authorities and private bodies should
aim at both preventing and reducing adverse effects caused by
potentially hazardous agents and degraded urban and rural environments.
<LI>Environmental standards need to be continually reviewed to
take account of new knowledge about the environment and health
and of the effects of future economic development. Where applicable
such standards should be harmonized.
<LI>The principle should be applied whereby every public and private
body that causes or may cause damage to the environment is made
financially responsible (the polluter pays principle).
<LI>Criteria and procedures to quantify, monitor and evaluate
environmental and health damage should be further developed and
implemented.
<LI>Trade and economic policies and development assistance programmes
affecting the environment and health in foreign countries should
comply with all the above principles. Export of environmental
and health hazards should be avoided.
<LI>Development assistance should promote sustainable development
and the safeguarding and improvement of human health as one of
its integral components.
</OL>

<H3>Strategic elements</H3>

<OL>
<LI>The environment should be managed as a positive resource for
human health and wellbeing.
<LI>In order to protect health comprehensive strategies are required,
including, <I>inter alia, </I>the following elements:
<UL>
<LI>The responsibilities of public and private bodies for implementing
appropriate measures should be clearly defined at all levels.
<LI>
<LI>Control measures and other tools should be applied, as appropriate,
to reduce risks to health and wellbeing from environmental factors.
Fiscal, administrative and economic instruments and land-use planning
have a vital role to play in promoting environmental conditions
conducive to health and wellbeing and should be used for that
purpose.
<LI>Better methods of prevention should be introduced as knowledge
expands, including the use of the most appropriate and cost-effective
technologies and, if necessary, the imposition of bans.
<LI>Low-impact technology and products and the recycling and reuse
of wastes should be encouraged. Changes should be made, as necessary,
in raw materials, production processes and waste management techniques.
<LI>High standards of management and operation should be followed
to ensure that appropriate technologies and best practices are
applied, that regulations and guidance are adhered to, and that
accidents and human failures are avoided.
<LI>Appropriate regulations should be promulgated; they should
be both enforceable and enforced.
<LI>Standards should be set on the basis of the best available
scientific information. The cost and benefit of action or lack
of action and feasibility may also have to be assessed but in
all cases risks should be minimized.
<LI>Comprehensive strategies should be developed that take account
of the risks to human health and the environment arising from
chemicals. These strategies should include, <I>inter alia, </I>registration
procedures for new chemicals and systematic examination of existing
chemicals.
<LI>Contingency planning should be undertaken to deal with all
types of serious accident, including those with transfrontier
consequences.
<LI>Information systems should be strengthened to support monitoring
of the effectiveness of measures taken, trend analysis, priority-setting
and decision-making.
<LI>Environmental impact assessment should give greater emphasis
to health aspects. Individuals and communities directly affected
by the quality of a specific environment should be consulted and
involved in managing that environment.
</UL>

<LI>Medical and other relevant disciplines should be encouraged
to pay greater attention to all aspects of environmental health.
Environmental toxicology and environmental epidemiology are key
tools of environmental health research and should be strengthened
and further developed as special disciplines within the Region.
<LI>Interdisciplinary research programmes in environmental epidemiology
with the aim of clarifying links between the environment and health
should be encouraged and strengthened at regional, national and
international levels.
<LI>The health sector should have responsibility for epidemiological
surveillance through data collection, compilation, analysis and
risk assessment of the health impact of environmental factors
and for informing other sectors of society and the general public
of trends and priorities.
<LI>National and international programmes of multidisciplinary
training, as well as the provision of health education and information
for public and private bodies, should be encouraged and strengthened.
</OL>

<H3>Priorities</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Governments and other public authorities, without prejudice
to the importance of problem areas specific to their respective
countries, the European Community and other intergovernmental
organizations, as appropriate, should pay particular attention
to the following urgent issues of the environment and health at
local, regional, national and international levels and to take
action on them:
<UL>
<LI>global disturbances to the environment such as the destruction
of the ozone layer and climatic change;
<LI>urban development, planning and renewal to protect health
and promote wellbeing;
<LI>safe and adequate drinking-water supplies on the basis of
the WHO Guidelines for drinking-water quality together with hygienic
waste disposal for all urban and rural communities;
<LI>water quality in relation to surface, ground, coastal and
recreational waters;
<LI>microbiological and chemical safety of food;
<LI>the environment and health impact of:
<UL>
<LI>various energy options
<LI>transport, especially road transport
<LI>agricultural practices, including the use of fertilizers and
pesticides, and waste disposal;
<LI>air quality on the basis of the WHO Air quality guidelines
for Europe, especially in relation to oxides of sulfur and nitrogen,
the photochemical oxidants (&quot;summer smog&quot;) and volatile
organic compounds;
<LI>indoor air quality (residential, recreational and occupational),
including the effects of radon, passive smoking and chemicals;
<LI>persistent chemicals and those causing chronic effects;
<LI>hazardous wastes including management, transport and disposal;
<LI>biotechnology and in particular genetically modified organisms;
<LI>contingency planning for and in response to accidents and
disasters;
<LI>cleaner technologies as preventive measures.
</UL>

</UL>

<LI>In addressing all of these priorities, the importance of intersectoral
environmental planning and community management to generate optimal
health and wellbeing should be borne in mind.
<LI>Health promotion should be added to health protection so as
to induce the adoption of healthy lifestyles in a clean and harmonious
environment.
<LI>It should be recognized that some urgent problems require
direct and immediate international cooperation and joint efforts.
</OL>

<H3>The way forward</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Member States of the European Region should:
<UL>
<LI>take all necessary steps to reverse negative trends as soon
as possible and to maintain and increase the health-related improvements
already taking place. In particular, they should make every effort
to implement WHO's regional strategy for health for all as it
concerns the environment and health;
<LI>strengthen collaboration among themselves and, where appropriate,
with the European Community and other intergovernmental bodies
on mutual and transfrontier environmental problems that pose a
threat to health;
<LI>ensure that the Charter adopted at this meeting is made widely
available in the languages of the European Region.
</UL>

<LI>The WHO Regional Office for Europe is invited to:
<UL>
<LI>explore ways of strengthening international mechanisms for
assessing potential hazards to health associated with the environment
and for developing guidance on their control;
<LI>make a critical study of existing indicators of the effects
of the environment on health and, where necessary, develop others
that are both specific and effective;
<LI>establish a European Advisory Committee on the Environment
and Health in consultation with the governments of the countries
of the Region;
<LI>in collaboration with the governments of the European countries,
examine the desirability and feasibility of establishing a European
Centre for the Environment and Health or other suitable institutional
arrangements, with a view to strengthening collaboration on the
health aspects of environmental protection with special emphasis
on information systems, mechanisms for exchanging experience and
coordinated studies. In such arrangements, cooperation with the
United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe and other organizations is desirable. Account
should be taken of the environmental agency to be established
within the European Community.
</UL>

<LI>Member States of the European Region and WHO should:
<UL>
<LI>promote the widest possible endorsement of the principles
and attainment of the objectives of the Charter.
</UL>

<LI>European Ministers of the Environment and of Health should:
<UL>
<LI>meet again within five years to evaluate national and international
progress and to endorse specific action plans drawn up by WHO
and other international organizations for eliminating the most
significant environmental threats to health as rapidly as possible.
</UL>

by ensuring that urban development is environmentally sustainable.
<P>
In particular, we recognize the adverse effects
of traffic on health and the environment, and the need for comprehensive
urban transport planning that takes account of these effects.
<H3>Equity</H3>


 Harmful effects on people 's health arise
not only from poverty but also from other kinds of social and
educational disadvantage. </I>
<P>
We pledge our political support for programmes
that promote equity and reduce inequalities in health within our
cities.
<P>
In particular, in this United Nations International
Year of Literacy, we recognize the vital contribution that our
city educational systems play in creating and promoting health.
<H3>Intersectorality and accountability</H3>

<P>
 Health is mainly the result of society's
combined action (or lack of action) on the physical and social
environment. Improvements in health are due only in part to the
advances of <I><B>medical care </B>systems.</I> </I>
<P>
We pledge our political support for the strengthening
of intersectoral action on the broader determinants of health
and for exploring with our city councils or other city authorities
ways to make health and environmental impact assessment part of
all urban planning decisions, policies and programmes.
<H3>International dimensions</H3>

<P>
 Peace is an essential prerequisite for health.
In this context, we welcome the new openness in Europe and affirm
our belief that cities play an essential role in building bridges
of understanding within and between countries of Europe and the
world. </I>
<P>
We pledge our political support for the WHO
Healthy Cities project within the national and international networks
and organizations to which we belong, and will encourage the national
and international development of the new public health movement.

<H2>2. Action for healthy cities</H2>

<P>
We hereby confirm our commitment to the WHO
Healthy Cities project, and specifically reconfirm our commitment
to take what measures we can to ensure the effective operation
of the project in our cities, namely:
<UL>
<li>establishing effective intersectoral mechanisms
for developing healthy public policies;
<LI>developing a city health plan that identifies
the major health challenges and proposes a comprehensive, citywide
intersectoral strategy to address them;
<LI>establishing an adequately staffed Healthy
City organization;
<LI>creating mechanisms for public accountability
for the effects of decision&#173;making on health;
<LI>ensuring effective community participation
in all decisions and actions affecting health.
</UL>


To ensure the long&#173;term success of the
Healthy Cities movement, we seek to match the recent commitment
of the WHO Regional Office for Europe by continuing our involvement
at 1east until 1995. In addition, we will explore, with councils,
participation in EXPO 1992 to be held in Seville, and EXPO 1995
to be held in Vienna and Budapest, as part the Healthy Cities
exhibit/programme intended to give high visibility to successes
of the Healthy Cities project.
<P>
We hereby pledge that, to promote the health
of our cities and citizens, we will explore with our city councils
other city authorities actions that can contribute to recent WHO
policy initiatives, including:
<UL>
<LI>the European Charter on Environment and
Health;
<LI>the European Action Plan on Tobacco or
Health;
<LI>the WHO air quality guidelines;
<LI>the WHO policy on the prevention AIDS and
the care of people with AIDS.
</UL>


We recognize the need for additional resources,
beyond those that can provided by our own cities and Who, to support
the further growth and development of the project. Accordingly,
we call on WHO:
<UL>
<LI>to take the lead in the European Region,
with other partners, in establishing joint action in urban health
that will provide funding and resources with particular emphasis
on the cities in Europe with greatest problems and the fewest
resources;
<LI>to explore the establishment of increased
financial support to the Healthy Cities project such as a European
health fund;
<LI>to explore and facilitate the establishment
of a Healthy Cities institute support the Healthy Cities movement;
<LI>to facilitate the creation of a European
Healthy Cities association;
<LI>to broaden the Healthy Cities project to
cities in the developing countries.
</UL>


We will provide political support to WHO in
its efforts to expand the resources available to the project.
We undertake to report on our progress in implementing the action
here described in our cities at the next Meeting of Mayors, which
will take place at the 1992 Healthy Cities Symposium in Copenhagen.
<H2>3. Conclusions</H2>


We recognize health and its maintenance as
major social investments.
<P>
We reiterate our commitment to the concepts
and principles of health promotion as defined in the Ottawa Charter
for Health Promotion.
<P>
We challenge and support the WHO Healthy Cities
project in its approach to address the overall ecological issues
of our ways of living.
<P>
We urge cities throughout Europe and beyond
to participate in the Healthy Cities movement and to join us in
our commitment to a strong public health alliance.

<H1><CENTER>Vienna Statement on Investing in Women's Health <BR>
in the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe</H1>

<H2>Women's Health Counts: Conference on the Health of
Women in Central and Eastern Europe, Vienna, Austria, 16-18 February
1994</CENTER></H2>

<HR>


This statement reflects the consensus of the
participants attending Women's Health Counts: Conference on the
Health of Women in Central and Eastern Europe.
<H3>Introduction</H3>


&quot;Women's health must be given the highest
level of visibility and urgency,&quot; stated the 1992 World Health
Assembly. This encouraged the World Health Organization (WHO)
Regional Office for Europe to launch the Investing in Women's
Health initiative. This initiative builds on a network first established
in 1991 at a WHO workshop in Vienna for women from the countries
of central and eastern Europe. In 1994, each Member State of the
WHO European Region was requested to nominate a focal point for
women and health. These counterparts will form the first European
Women's Health Forum.
<P>
As a result of the widening health gap between
the eastern and western halves of the Region and the WHO commitment
to equity, the first phase of the initiative focused on 11 countries
and one city in the WHO Healthy Cities project. The results of
the first year of work on the initiative - a comparative analysis
called &quot;Highlights on Women's Health&quot;, as well as detailed
country profiles - were presented at Women's Health Counts: Conference
on the Health of Women in Central and Eastern Europe. The Conference
was held in Vienna, Austria from 16 to 18 February 1994. Its 270
participants from 40 countries agreed on the following consensus
statement.
<P>
The Statement sets out six principles to advance
women's health throughout the WHO European Region. Secondly, the
Statement establishes six priority areas for action which, although
often generalizable throughout the WHO European Region, pay specific
attention to women in the countries of central and eastern Europe
and the newly independent states of the former USSR. Finally,
it describes six policy mechanisms to strengthen the commitment
to women's health in policy reform throughout the WHO European
Region.<BR>

<H3>Principles</H3>


The Investing in Women's Health initiative
is guided by six principles. These principles form the basis of
an approach to women's health that builds on WHO's commitment
to equity, human rights and primary health care. These six principles
include:
<UL>
<LI>investment in health;
<LI>human rights;
<LI>life-span health;
<LI>empowerment;
<LI>woman-friendly and appropriate services; and
<LI>gender relationships.
</UL>

<H4>1. Investment in health</H4>


Women are a key resource to societies. As the
human development index clearly shows, however, no country treats
its women as well as its men, or according to women's contribution
to the economy. A range of studies by the United Nations and the
World Bank clearly show that investments in women yield high returns
in the form of faster growth, higher efficiency, greater savings
and reduced poverty. Through improvements in women's health, governments
can make significant contributions to economic and social development.
Investments in women's health are beneficial in their own right.
They lead to healthier children, improved household and community
welfare, lower health care costs, and greater productivity. The
education of girls and women, child support, housing and primary
health care for women, as well as their children, must become
important priorities for policy-makers.
<H4>2. Human rights</H4>


The WHO Constitution defines health as &quot;one
of the fundamental human rights&quot;. This principle has not
been sufficiently applied to women and their health needs.
<P>
Gender inequality is an epidemiological fact.
Public health intervention must aim to redress this imbalance.
A woman must have the right to sexual and reproductive choice.
A woman's right to control her own sexuality and fertility must
be recognized and accorded the status of a fundamental human right.
 Legislation on reproductive rights should be consistent with
the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination Against Women and protect women's rights to
sexual and reproductive choice.
<H4>3. Life-span health</H4>


Approaches to women's health must be based
on the WHO definition of health, which encompasses physical, social
and mental wellbeing. A health policy that is beneficial to women
must consider the quality of their health throughout the entire
life-span, and respond to the social, political and economic realities
of women's lives.
<H4>4. Empowerment </H4>


The empowerment of women results from their
ability to join together to promote change.  Women need to be
leaders in formulating health policy, making decisions, and carrying
out programmes.  This is a prerequisite for moving the women's
health agenda forward.
<H4>5. Woman-friendly and appropriate services</H4>


Health strategies and services must respect
and protect the dignity of women, while ensuring their right to
privacy. No individual or group should suffer discrimination or
stigmatization because of gender.  Health services must be gender-sensitive
and appropriate for the special needs of women.
<H4>6. Gender relationships</H4>


Significant change in women's health implies
a shift in the relationship between men and women. Women and men
need to share responsibility for family planning and child-rearing.
<H3>Priorities for action </H3>


Most societies in the countries of central
and eastern Europe (CCEE) and the newly independent states (NIS)
of the former USSR are facing a deterioration in the health of
their populations. For example, the difference in life expectancy
between women in eastern and western Europe is on average 5 to
10 years. The most sensitive indicator today is the maternal mortality
rate. It is rising in many of the CCEE/NIS: the rates in some
countries are up to 10 times higher than those in many western
countries of the Region. Both an emergency response and a long-term
investment strategy are needed to reverse these trends.
<P>
There is an enormous range of challenges for
reforming the health systems in the CCEE/NIS. The Conference participants
identified six priority areas in women's health. While these priority
areas focus on the concerns raised by the participants from the
CCEE/NIS, they are relevant to women throughout the WHO European
Region. These priorities include:
<UL>
<LI>reduced maternal death and increased maternal safety;
<LI>promotion of sexual and reproductive health;
<LI>the introduction of woman-friendly reimbursement policies;
<LI>promotion of programmes for healthy lifestyles;
<LI>reducing violence against women; and
<LI>improving the situation of women working in the health care
system.
</UL>

<H4>1. Reduced maternal death and increased maternal safety require:
</H4>

<UL>
<LI>upgraded maternal and child health services;
<LI>more cost-effective prenatal intervention;
<LI>updated women-centred delivery practices;
<LI>the promotion of breastfeeding;
<LI>updated knowledge and skills of midwives;
<LI>protection against inappropriate medical technology;
<LI>reduced unsafe abortions; and
<LI>high quality of care in abortions.
</UL>

<H4>2. Promotion of sexual and reproductive health requires:</H4>

<UL>
<LI>more sex education for girls and boys;
<LI>wider availability of contraceptives;
<LI>a variety of contraceptives from which to choose;
<LI>integrated family planning services in the community;
<LI>confidential testing and counselling for sexually transmitted
diseases;
<LI>treatment for sexually transmitted diseases;
<LI>provide confidential counselling for people with HIV and AIDS;
and
<LI>counselling for sex workers.
</UL>

<H4>3. The introduction of woman-friendly reimbursement policies
requires:</H4>

<UL>
<LI>supporting reimbursement of the cost for contraceptives;
<LI>giving priority to comprehensive primary care services;
<LI>giving priority to preventive services and health promotion
programmes, particularly for heart disease and stroke; and
<LI>providing screening for breast and cervical cancer.
</UL>

<H4>4. Promotion of programmes promoting healthy lifestyles would:
</H4>

<UL>
<LI>promote healthy nutrition;
<LI>promote psychological and mental health;
<LI>support tobacco-free lifestyles;
<LI>provide treatment for substance abuse; and
<LI>promote healthy aging.
</UL>

<H4>5. Reducing violence against women requires:</H4>

<UL>
<LI>recognizing domestic violence and rape as public health issues;
<LI>enacting and enforcing laws against battering and rape;
<LI>acting against forced prostitution and traffic in women; and
<LI>providing counselling and shelter to women in need.
</UL>

<H4>6. Improving the situation of women working in the health
care system requires:</H4>

<UL>
<LI>ensuring better pay, better working conditions, and higher
status for women health workers;
<LI>appointing more women to leadership positions; and
<LI>providing high quality continuing education.
</UL>

<H3>Political commitment to women's health policy</H3>
The Conference documented the wide range of
policy initiatives already under way. But much remains to be done
to strengthen the commitment to women's health in policy reform.
This means appointing more women to leadership positions, and
ensuring the full involvement of women's groups and nongovernmental
organizations in an interactive policy process. Six policy mechanisms
were recommended.
<OL>
<LI>Countries should establish an office for women's health, charged
with developing an intersectoral women's health policy and action
plan.
<LI>National women's health forums should be created in each country.
<LI>Countries should develop a reliable information base for an
intersectoral women's health policy, including sectors such as
education, labour, welfare and housing.  This requires reporting
and monitoring systems that use gender-specific, disaggregated
data on women's socioeconomic and health conditions.
<LI>Countries should publish comprehensive reports on women's
health at regular intervals, and present them to parliaments,
the media and the general public.
<LI>Countries should develop research strategies for women's health
that specify priority areas for investigation and outline subsequent
action.  Research should be multidisciplinary and support the
development of a new social epidemiology of women's health.<BR>
All countries should increase their research efforts in women's
health.
<LI>All Member States of the European Region should produce women's
health reports in the context of the Regional Office's women's
health initiative. This material will be part of the materials
presented at the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women,
to be held in Beijing in September 1995. This material will also
be presented at the forthcoming Economic Commission for Europe
Regional Preparatory Meeting, to be held in Vienna in October
1994, as well as the preceding forum for nongovernmental organizations.
</OL>

<H3>Coordination of effort</H3>

Initiatives in women's health throughout the
Region should be well coordinated. Investors and donors - mulitlateral
and bilateral - should review their priorities and pay greater
attention to the health of women. They should ensure that women
experts are actively included as part of the consultant teams
working with the CCEE/NIS.
<P>
WHO should explore the feasibility of establishing
a network of centres for women's health to support research and
training in women's health for the European Region, and continue
to monitor women's health through regular comparative highlights
and country profiles.
<H3>Community involvement and women's empowerment </H3>

Mechanisms must be established for listening
to women's views on their own needs and the issues they confront.
Social and cultural differences must be recognized and respected.
People need to be informed about research findings that relate
to women's health in ways that are both understandable and relevant.
Most important, these mechanisms must empower women to care for
their own health.
<H3>Meeting the challenge together</H3>

Women's health is an issue that crosses borders,
political systems and cultural differences.  International cooperation
is essential. WHO should seek alliances with other organizations
to support the Investing in Women's Health initiative.<BR>

1.  We, the Ministers of the Environment and the Ministers of
Health of the European Member States of the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the Members of the European Commission (EC) responsible
for environment and health, have met here in Helsinki under the
auspices of the Finnish Government and the WHO Regional Office
for Europe, in accordance with the European Charter on Environment
and Health adopted at our First Conference, held in Frankfurt,
Germany in 1989, and the mandate given to us through Agenda 21
adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED) in 1992.
<P>
2.  We have a shared goal before us: to improve the living and
health conditions of the present generation, to ensure that the
carrying capacity of nature is not exceeded and that the right
of future generations to a satisfying and productive life is safeguarded.
Sustainable development can only be assured by radical changes
in present patterns of production and consumption. Coexistence
between man and nature is a prerequisite for the future of humankind.
Prosperity and the continuing development of society must be based
on full recognition and sustained protection of the biological
diversity of nature.
<H3><a name="P1">Progress</A></h3>


3.  This Second Conference takes place in a politically and economically
different Europe from that of 1989. Major political changes have
led to a substantial increase in the number of European Member
States of WHO. Some countries are torn by armed conflicts. Many
now face the problems of transition from a centrally planned to
a market economy. Economic recession has affected most parts of
the Region. In this new geopolitical setting, a number of related
international initiatives are being taken which address environment
and health issues of direct concern to Europe. (See note 3). We
draw attention to the importance of the Environment for Europe
process initiated at Dobris Castle in 1991, which led to the adoption
by the Pan-European Ministerial Conference in Lucerne in 1993
of the Environmental Action Programme for Central and Eastern
Europe and the elements for a long-term Environmental Programme
for Europe. The initiatives taken under the Environment for Europe
process and our commitments to action in environment and health
must be mutually supportive and closely related to the work of
the Commission on Sustainable Development established by United
Nations General Assembly resolution. It is only in this way that
the European family can make a common and coherent response to
the challenges of environment, health and development.<P>
<I>Note 3:</I><BR>
We take particular note of the Basle Convention on the Control of  Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biodiversity, all of which have now entered into force, while the provisions of the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer have been updated and strengthened. Three new conventions have been developed under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE): the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context and the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents.

<P>
4.  We are satisfied that the most important decisions of our
First Conference have been followed through. Many countries now
base their policies on health and the environment on the European
Charter. A WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (WHO/ECEH)
is established and operational. In preparing the report Concern
for Europe's Tomorrow (CET), the Centre developed a comprehensive
regional analysis which gives an overall assessment of health
in relation to the environment.

<P>
5.  In 1993 the World Health Assembly adopted a Global Strategy
on Health and Environment in response to the recommendation of
the WHO Commission on Health and Environment and the results of
the UNCED. This provides a unifying framework for objectives and
actions in the area of health and environment.

<H3><a name="P2">The challenge in environment and health</A></H3>


We note that the nature and extent of issues requiring preventive
or remedial action have been highlighted by the work carried out
in preparation both of the CET report and the Pan-European State
of the Environment Report prepared under the Environment for Europe
process.(See note 4). We are disturbed at the serious consequences
for the health and wellbeing of large numbers of people within
the European Region resulting from unsatisfactory living, working
and recreational environments, such as:

<H4>Contaminated food and water</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Four years after the end of the United Nations International
Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, over 100 million
people in the Region lack access to reliable supplies of safe
drinking water and an even greater number are not provided with
sanitation services.
</UL>

<p>

<UL>
<LI>Waterborne infections such as hepatitis A and diarrhoeal diseases
are a major problem in the eastern parts of the Region where,
in addition to difficulties in provision of reliable supplies,
inadequate water treatment and maintenance of distribution systems
result in microbiological contamination of the water supply.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Illnesses due to microbiological contamination of food are
increasing throughout the Region owing to unwise or deficient
practices and technologies in food production, processing and
storage.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Some 130 million people a year are estimated to be at risk
of disease due to <I>Salmonella</I> and <I>Campylobacter</I> alone.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Ambient and indoor air pollution</H4>

<UL>
<LI>The respiratory systems of millions living in some urban areas
are at risk because of the levels of ambient air pollution from
existing power plants, industry and growing vehicular traffic.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Indoor air pollution, including pollution from tobacco smoke
and from radon, aggravated by the lack of adequate ventilation,
is increasingly recognized as a cause of ill health.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Air pollution may be a cause of reported increases in asthma
attacks and other allergic reactions.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>In some areas, emissions of lead from industry and from vehicles
using leaded gasoline cause blood levels of lead in young children
which may be associated with impaired mental development.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Death and injuries from all forms of accident, including nuclear
emergencies</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Within the Region, road, home and occupational accidents are
the cause of over 200&nbsp;000 deaths each year and a large number
of injuries and permanent disabilities. Environmental factors
contribute to many of these accidents; their incidence could be
reduced by effective preventive measures.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Eight years after Chernobyl, the design and operational condition
of many nuclear power plants are still in need of urgent improvement
in order to prevent another such accident.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Already, in some areas affected by the Chernobyl accident,
the frequency of thyroid cancer in children has risen about one
hundredfold; many more people are suffering from psychosomatic
disorders brought on by the accident and uncertainties as to its
long-term effects on their health.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Some countries, seeking a guarantee against major disasters
and the resulting threats to human health or for other reasons,
have adopted an energy policy which excludes nuclear power.

<LI>A number of major policy decisions in the past, such as those
relating to the development of the Aral Sea basin for intensive
agriculture and the use of Semipalatinsk for nuclear weapons testing,
have created situations which are today hazardous to the health
of millions of people.
</UL>

<P>

<H4>Urban health</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Deteriorating living conditions in many urban areas have adverse
effects on the health of large numbers of citizens. Structural
and technological change in the economy has resulted in unacceptably
high levels of unemployment, especially among young people, which
can have adverse effects on physical and mental health. Levels
of deprivation and squalor are already unacceptable in many places.
Lack of action on these issues could threaten the very cohesion
of our society.

<H4>Occupational health</H4>

<UL>
<LI>About half the workers out of a total of 400&nbsp;million
in the Region do not have access to adequate occupational health
services.

<LI>There are 25 000 fatal accidents at work each year, together
with an estimated 10&nbsp;million injuries.

<P>
7.  In implementing this Declaration, we will follow the recommendations
of the 1992 report of the WHO Commission on Health and Environment,
which emphasized that there is complementarity, not conflict,
in the promotion of health and the protection of the environment.
The WHO Commission's concept has been endorsed by the Commission
on Sustainable Development, which has stressed the need to integrate
health, environment and development goals and activities: we will
be guided by its decisions as these relate to environment and
health in Europe. We recognize that the need for better utilization
of the limited resources available within and to countries calls
for extended and intensified international cooperation. Sustainability
must be built into the strategies of all sectors; the real cost
of utilization of scarce non-renewable resources must be made
transparent.

<P>
8.  We shall abide by the policies and principles embodied in
the European Targets for Health for All and the European Charter
on Environment and Health, especially its provisions for preventive
measures. We pledge ourselves to act:
<UL>
<LI>to maintain solidarity, both within and among nations, by
our participation in collaborative efforts to improve environmental
health and by giving priority to conditions in the worst affected
areas of the Region;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to ensure sustainability in development, through appropriate
action in the environment and health sectors, in order to meet
the needs of the present population without compromising the ability
of future generations to meet theirs;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to practice cooperation and partnership, in pursuit of improvements
in environment and health, not only between the health and environmental
sectors but also with other economic sectors and with all social
partners having contributions to make in setting targets and implementing
plans;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to apply the principle of subsidiarity, in order to ensure
that in all circumstances decisions are made at the most effective
level.
</UL>

<P>


9.  Member States decide their priorities in the light of their
own situations, but there are certain issues such as water and
air quality which, because of the severity or scale of the problems
caused, demand the attention of all countries. We endorse the
Environmental Health Action Plan for Europe (EHAPE) as the means
through which we may protect and promote health and conserve and
improve the environment. We are committed to implementing its
major thrusts, as follows.

<H4>Country, regional and local actions</H4>


10.  We commit our respective health and environment departments
to developing jointly, not later than 1997, action plans on health
and the environment, working with and through competent authorities
or inviting them to draw up such action plans where appropriate
and legally or constitutionally required. These plans should be
integrated in or closely linked with both environmental action
programmes and with health planning processes, and specifically
the action plans required by the UNCED follow-up and the Environment
for Europe process. We will intensify cooperation with other governmental
authorities, such as those responsible for agriculture, energy,
industry, transport and tourism, in order to integrate environment
and health issues into their existing policies, as an important
step towards sustainability.

<P>
11.  We are convinced that there is a pressing need for a more
comprehensive, integrated approach to creating healthy and ecologically
sound local communities and for a much better understanding of
the interplay of the many factors contributing to their wellbeing.
We will act in response to UNCED's call for countries &quot;to
develop plans for priority actions based on cooperative planning
by the various levels of government, nongovernmental organizations
and local communities&quot;.

<H4>Transfrontier and Europe-wide actions</H4>


12.  In order to ensure that health considerations are given appropriate
weight in determining action to be taken, we request WHO, in partnership
with other relevant international organizations, to intensify
its contribution to the further elaboration and implementation
of provisions regarding air, water and soil pollution in those
environmental conventions which have among their aims the protection
of human health.(See note 5). This should include the development
of mechanisms for effective implementation in countries. Such
mechanisms for effective implementation are legislation; the assignment
of responsibilities, including those for coordination between
environmental and health sectors; and ensuring that levels of
pollutants in air, water, soil and food are monitored for the
purpose of achieving and sustaining reductions of exposure. Having
in mind potential health effects, we recommend that, wherever
pollution across borders is known to make a significant contribution
to total exposure, efforts made should ensure that sources of
pollutants are adequately controlled.
<I>Note 5:
</I><BR>In particular, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and its related protocols as well as the Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes; the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context; the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents; the International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and the International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on Nuclear Safety which is open for signature.
<P>
13.  We give our support to WHO's environmental health programme
in Europe and to all other related European programmes designed
to develop and strengthen environmental health management. We
place special emphasis on actions for the improvement of essential
environmental health services including occupational health, information
systems, systems for risk assessment and management, professional
training, and public awareness and participation.

<P>
14.  We resolve, as a matter of urgency, to develop increased
European collaboration on defining interrelationships between
the urban environment and health. Innovative approaches to and
measures for empowering inhabitants to develop their living environments
are now required, to reverse the negative trends in the quality
of life which are being experienced in many cities. In order to
stimulate action on environmental, health and social problems,
we strongly support efforts to improve urban living conditions
through the activities of the Europe-wide &quot;Healthy Cities&quot;
and other such networks.

<P>
15.  We undertake to strengthen coordinated action in our countries
to reduce the growing toll of human lives taken by accidents.
As a first step, we propose that consideration should be given
to the collection, on a uniform basis throughout the Region, of
information on the environmental and behavioural causes of different
categories of accidents, in order to determine where remedial
action can most usefully be applied.

<P>
16.  We call on WHO to collaborate with other organizations in
the establishment or strengthening of effective preventive measures,
including the use of early warning systems and appropriate public
health counter-measures, so that potentially affected countries
can take timely action.

<P>
17.  We recognize that the scientific basis for action on some
problems of concern to us needs to be strengthened. To this end,
we endorse the proposal for a joint programme of research involving
 the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Science Foundation
and the European Commission. We agree that the establishment of
a regular series of international meetings to share the results
of this programme and other research would be valuable.

<H4>Actions to support countries in transition and those suffering
from the results of armed conflict</H4>

<P>
18.  We stand ready to respond to requests from countries in economic
and social transition which may need assistance to make improvements
in their environmental health services, both bilaterally and through
existing international mechanisms. We pledge support to programmes
aimed at remedying specific environmental situations in relation
to health in those countries where internationally based action
is warranted, with particular reference to international agreements
already reached. We request WHO, in partnership with other international
organizations and funding agencies, to develop and coordinate
the health dimensions of such programmes in concert with the Environmental
Programme for Europe and in liaison with the implementation of
the Environmental Action Programme for Central and Eastern Europe,
as well as international river basin, enclosed seas and other
subregional action programmes.
<P>
19.  We acknowledge that external assistance will be effective
only if countries' efforts are directed to enhancing and as necessary
reforming environmental health services and information systems,
training environmental health professionals and building public
awareness. We pledge support to the continuation of technical
assistance, for which the National Integrated Programmes on Environment
and Health, developed by WHO/ECEH, may serve as a model.

<P>
20.  Aware that many cities and towns in countries in transition
suffer from poorly maintained public services, we call on WHO
and other organizations concerned to give priority to the low-visibility
but important task of rehabilitating services such as those for
water supply and water and waste treatment that are essential
to health. In view of the long neglect of these services in many
countries, we stress the need for adequate training of the staff
responsible for their efficient operation and proper maintenance.
In pursuing these objectives, countries should draw on the Action
Plan on Drinking Water and Sanitation adopted by the Commission
on Sustainable Development.

<P>
21.  We express our horror at the hostilities and civil strife
in the disputed areas of the Region, which have already resulted
in hundreds of thousands of people being killed, many more wounded
and millions displaced. We acknowledge the urgent need for our
solidarity to be expressed in operational terms, in order to hasten
the return of the survivors of the hostilities to normal life.
We support and strongly encourage the intensification of actions
taken by WHO, in cooperation with other United Nations bodies,
relief organizations and individual Member States of WHO, to protect
public health conditions in the countries and areas that are now
or have recently been the theatre of armed hostilities. The task
of restoring healthy living conditions will be even more daunting.
We request WHO, in close cooperation with Member States and all
relevant organizations, including funding agencies, to start now
to contribute to planning the major efforts that will be required
to alleviate adverse health conditions and restore basic environmental
health services once peace is achieved.

<H3><a name="P4">Institutional support</A></H3>


22.  We recognize that the successful sustained implementation
of EHAPE is dependent on collaboration between the partners in
the Environment for Europe process and the WHO Regional Organization
for Europe,(See note 6) utilizing existing coordinating mechanisms
so far as possible.
<I>Note 6:
</I><BR>
The term "regional organization" (WHO Constitution Chapter 11, Articles  44-53) refers collectively to the separate but interactive roles and responsibilities of WHO Member States, the Regional Committee and the Regional Office.
<P>
23.  We have judged that fulfilment of EHAPE will require its
own machinery. To harness the cooperation and involvement of Member
States through their ministries of the environment and of health,
together with relevant international organizations and funding
agencies, in the fulfilment of EHAPE we resolve that a European
Environment and Health Committee (EEHC) be established.

<P>
24.  We consider that the Committee should comprise four representatives
designated by the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, four representatives
selected by the UN/ECE Committee on Environmental Policy and,
subject to the approval of the respective institutions, representatives
designated by UN/ECE, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
WHO, EC, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and possibly other intergovernmental
organizations and international funding agencies.

<P>
25.  The Committee will become operational with effect from 1
January 1995, the membership initially comprising the representatives
of those bodies specifically mentioned above that have been nominated
by that time, thereby confirming the acceptance by those bodies
of the functions of the Committee as proposed below.
<P>
26.  A secretariat will be provided by the WHO Regional Office
for Europe alone or in cooperation with one or more of the other
organizations involved.
<P>
27.  We agree that the functions of EEHC will be:
<UL>
<LI>to promote the concept of sustainability as it is to be applied
in relation to environment and health.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to coordinate and evaluate the implementation of EHAPE;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>when requested by countries, to facilitate and support the
development of environmental health action plans, including assistance
in analysis of the economic, environment and health implications
of particular policy and intervention options; and to assist in
the identification of external resources for the development of
plans;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to cooperate with the bodies of the Environment for Europe
process, in order to promote the inclusion of actions addressing
health issues in, or their close linkage with, action plans for
the environment and to promote and facilitate development of joint
projects by international organizations at European level in support
of EHAPE;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to provide advice on environmental health issues to organizations
and donors ready to support countries in economic transition or
recovering from the effects of armed hostilities;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to assist in the identification of emerging environmental
health issues that require collaborative action or further study;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to promote a common research policy involving continuing collaboration
between the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Science
Foundation and other appropriate bodies that might wish to be
involved, such as EC;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>to foster information exchange and dissemination.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
28.  We request that EEHC should report annually on EHAPE implementation
to the WHO Regional Committee for Europe and through the UN/ECE
Senior Governmental Officials, Environment for Europe to the UN/ECE
Committee on Environmental Policy.
<P>
29.  We resolve that EEHC will be established initially for a
period of five years. An evaluation of its achievements and of
its future potential will be made and a report submitted to our
Third Ministerial Conference.

<P>
30.  We propose that WHO/ECEH, working closely with the European
Environment Agency and with other intergovernmental and nongovernmental
organizations, should be recognized as the principal technical
instrument for providing support to EHAPE and as the principal
executive arm of EEHC on technical issues. The Centre should,
to the extent that resources permit, respond to the needs of Member
States and to requests from EEHC in such fields as:
<UL>
<LI>technical cooperation with individual Member States in the
European Region of WHO in relation to the implementation of EHAPE
and specific environmental health issues, in close coordination
with multilateral and bilateral funding agencies;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>development of a comprehensive environmental health information
system capable of identifying priority issues, risk factors and
trends and measuring impact of interventions;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>contribution to the  development of scientific environmental
health criteria and guidelines as a basis for the assessment of
levels of safety and the definition of European norms and standards;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>provision of guidance on environmental health research and
development priorities aimed at effective action and, in close
cooperation with other international bodies, at securing the optimal
deployment of funding and resources that such research and development
require.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
31.  We consider that the capacity of WHO/ECEH to provide support
to Member States of WHO and to EEHC in the implementation of EHAPE
should be strengthened. We will endeavour to ensure that requisite
resources for this purpose are made available alongside the valuable
contributions now provided principally by France, Italy, the Netherlands
and WHO itself.

<H3><a name="P5">Conclusions</A></H3>


32.  We are encouraged by the progress achieved since the adoption
of the European Charter on Environment and Health in 1989 but
remain concerned about the continuing need for vigilance and improvement.
We welcome the support of our partners in Europe and in the international
community. We note with satisfaction the resolution of the European
Parliament submitted to this Conference. We are confident that
collectively we have the will, the means and the commitment to
succeed in these endeavours.
<P>
33.  We request the WHO Regional Office for Europe to convene
a Third European Conference on Environment and Health in 1999,
to review progress, particularly the implementation of EHAPE,
and to set the agenda for environment and health in the early
years of the twenty-first century.

<H1><CENTER>The Copenhagen Declaration</H1>

<H2>European Health Policy Conference: Opportunities for
the Future, Copenhagen, Denmark, 5-9
December 1994</CENTER></H2>

<HR>


(The Conference agreed to refer this Copenhagen Declaration to
the Standing Committee of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe
for consideration and preparation of a draft resolution to be
submitted to the Regional Committee at its forty-fifth session.)
<P>
We, the delegations of the Member States in the European Region
of the World Health Organization, meeting in Copenhagen from 5&nbsp;to
9&nbsp;December 1994, acutely aware that our societies stand at
an historic crossroads, pledge ourselves to promote and protect
the health of our peoples as a fundamental value of our societies.
<H3>1. The challenges to health in Europe</H3>


Actions to improve health must be recognized as a measurement
of a country's social consciousness and as a means of investing
in its human capital.
<P>
We are concerned about the fact that, in spite of some progress
observed, the 1993/1994 exercise to monitor progress towards health
for all (HFA) shows that considerable inequities in health still
persist between countries and between population groups in almost
all countries.
<P>
We recognize the problems posed by the resurgence of communicable
diseases in some countries and by the unhealthy lifestyles in
every country of the Region, and we support the actions proposed
to create a healthy environment and to address the consequences
of the Chernobyl accident, the development of the Aral Sea basin
for intensive agriculture and the use of Semipalatinsk for nuclear
weapons testing, as outlined in the Helsinki Declaration of June
1994.
<P>
The increasing numbers of health problems, with increasing numbers
of migrants, refugees and displaced persons now turning also to
less affluent parts of the European Region, are not being attended
to with a view to making long-term solutions emerge. Since migrants
form an integral part of our Region, they must also inevitably
be a part of the implementation of HFA policies designed to tackle
inequities, promote health and ensure access to high-quality health
care. And they need to be included in inter-European cooperation
for health.
<P>
Health in some countries is facing a crisis due to a deterioration
in the prerequisites for health and the economic constraints that
affect health care services.
<H3>2. The vision</H3>


We have a responsibility not merely to react to change but to
create necessary change and to shape our own future. To do this:
<UL>
<LI>we need a strategic approach that strikes a delicate balance
between long-term goals and short-term feasibility in today's
pluralistic society;
<LI>we need to reinforce the values of solidarity, equity and
human rights, while recognizing the rights of individuals to freedom
of choice, participation and dignity, as well as their obligations
to help strengthen their own health;
<LI>we need to reinforce the role of governments in protecting
and promoting health while striving to safeguard access to the
highest affordable quality of health care, even in situations
of unchanging or even decreasing national resources.
</UL>


The Member States in the Region should strengthen their commitment,
individually and collectively, to making every effort to:
<UL>
<LI>implement the European HFA policy in countries, by ensuring
that health policies and programmes are truly based on its principles
and methods of preventing disease;
<LI>promote healthy lifestyles, a healthy environment and quality-conscious,
cost-effective and accessible health care systems;
<LI>shape intersectoral policies and strategies for health gain
at the country, regional and local levels, clearly defining targets
that focus on outcomes in terms of health status, risk factors
and determinants of health;
<LI>monitor and evaluate progress towards these targets, thus
providing a scientific basis for continuous learning and improvement
of policies.
</UL>

<H3>3. Solidarity with people in need</H3>


We are committed to the fundamental value of the HFA movement
in directing our efforts towards those people and countries most
in need.
<H4>3.1 Preferential support for vulnerable and high-risk groups
within countries</H4>


Today, more than ever, there is a need to give a sharp focus,
in our social and health development, to policies and programmes
that can improve the health and quality of life of all our fellow
citizens, particularly children<I>, </I>the elderly, the poor,
migrants, refugees, displaced persons and the socially disadvantaged.

<P>
We therefore pledge ourselves to:
<UL>
<LI>heighten people's awareness of the need for health policies
and programmes that tackle inequities in health between different
groups in the population;
<LI>provide for equity in access to health care and health promotion
opportunities, ensuring that new systems for the financing and
provision of care do not endanger this;
<LI>ensure as far as possible that information is available on
inequities in health;
<LI>carry out health impact assessment of policy measures where
appropriate.
</UL>


<H4>3.2 Priority support for the countries of central and eastern
Europe and the newly independent states</H4>


We recommend that the following principles be adopted and actions
taken, in order to improve the efforts currently being made.
<UL>
<LI>In countries receiving support, we believe it is necessary
to develop national policies based on the HFA principles and,
following this, to draw up medium-term programmes for health development.
WHO and other international organizations should continue to give
support to countries in doing this.
<LI>For European countries and international aid and funding agencies
which are willing to assist the above-mentioned countries in their
development, such assistance should support the same principles.
WHO and other international organizations, as well as the European
Community, can offer useful guidance in this process.
<LI>For States which are members of intergovernmental organizations
and the European Community, we recommend that they support those
principles within the governing bodies of such organizations.
</UL>

<H4>3.3 Support to victims of armed conflict, natural and
man-made disasters</H4>


We believe that all European countries should make greater efforts
to help countries affected by armed conflict, natural and man-made
disasters and to support their agencies - international and nongovernmental
- that are currently trying to provide relief with the aims of
protecting the health of the suffering populations, including
refugees and displaced persons, and improving their health care.
<H3>4. Better managed health care development for health gain
</H3>


Attention should be focused more sharply on the improvements that
can be expected from different health care programmes, with particular
efforts to:
<UL>
<LI>strengthen public health infrastructures, management, training,
and research for the development of HFA policies and to ensure
that health system changes focus on health gain;
<LI>develop effective mechanisms for intersectoral action for
health at country, regional and local levels, as appropriate;
<LI>strengthen information systems, in order to identify health
problems, support the implementation of strategies for health
gain, and monitor and evaluate action;
<LI>assess the effectiveness of policy measures, both for health
promotion and for health care, and their impact on equity in health;
<LI>ensure that new approaches to the financing and provision
of health care lead to health gain, continuous quality development
and effective use of resources, giving due weight to health promotion,
disease prevention and the reduction of disability.
</UL>



<H3>5. Facilitating a dialogue for health</H3>


Those who implement and are affected by health policies should
be involved at an early stage in a dialogue for health. Countries
should encourage their participation in the process of health
policy formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
In so doing, countries should pay particular attention to:
<UL>
<LI>mobilizing parliamentarians, citizens and other partners in
policy development for the promotion and protection of health;
<LI>building new alliances with social groups with an interest
in health development.
</UL>

<H3>6. A new international alliance of partners for health</H3>


Noting with satisfaction the increased collaboration between international
organizations and the European Community, we believe that all
European governments could take the following steps to further
these developments:
<UL>
<LI>support closer and more effective cooperation by international
organizations and the European Community for the achievement of
health gain, in such a way as to build on their respective strengths
and complementarities;
<LI>promote and support the HFA approach when collaborating with
intergovernmental, nongovernmental and integrational organizations
and in bilateral agreements;
<LI>use national HFA policy frameworks in countries of central

<CENTER>European Charter on Alcohol</H1>

<H2>European Conference on Health, Society and Alcohol,
<BR>
Paris, France 12-14 December 1995</CENTER></H2>

<HR>

<H3>Ethical principles and goals</H3>


In furtherance of the European Alcohol Action Plan, the Paris
Conference calls on all Member States to draw up comprehensive
alcohol policies and implement programmes that give expression,
as appropriate in their differing cultures and social, legal and
economic environments, to the following ethical principles and
goals, on the understanding that this document does not confer
legal rights.
<OL>
<LI>All people have the right to a family, community and working
life protected from accidents, violence and other negative consequences
of alcohol consumption.
<LI>All people have the right to valid impartial information and
education, starting early in life, on the consequences of alcohol
consumption on health, the family and society.
<LI>All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in
an environment protected from the negative consequences of alcohol
consumption and, to the extent possible, from the promotion of
alcoholic beverages.
<LI>All people with hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption and
members of their families have the right to accessible treatment
and care.
<LI>All people who do not wish to consume alcohol, or who cannot
do so for health or other reasons, have the right to be safeguarded
from pressures to drink and be supported in their non-drinking
behaviour.
</OL>

<H3>Ten strategies for alcohol action</H3>


Research and successful examples in countries demonstrate that
significant health and economic benefits for the European Region
may be achieved if the following ten health promotion strategies
for action on alcohol are implemented to give effect to the ethical
principles and goals listed above, in accordance with the differing
cultures and social, legal and economic environments in each Member
State:
<OL>
<LI>Inform people of the consequences of alcohol consumption on
health, family and society and of the effective measures that
can be taken to prevent or minimize harm, building broad educational
programmes beginning in early childhood.
<LI>Promote public, private and working environments protected
from accidents and violence and other negative consequences of
alcohol consumption.
<LI>Establish and enforce laws that effectively discourage drink-driving.
<LI>Promote health by controlling the availability, for example
for young people, and influencing the price of alcoholic beverages,
for instance by taxation.
<LI>Implement strict controls, recognizing existing limitations
or bans in some countries, on direct and indirect advertising
of alcoholic beverages and ensure that no form of advertising
is specifically addressed to young people, for instance, through
the linking of alcohol to sports.
<LI>Ensure the accessibility of effective treatment and rehabilitation
services, with trained personnel, for people with hazardous or
harmful alcohol consumption and members of their families.
<LI>Foster awareness of ethical and legal responsibility among
those involved in the marketing or serving of alcoholic beverages,
ensure strict control of product safety and implement appropriate
measures against illicit production and sale.
<LI>Enhance the capacity of society to deal with alcohol through
the training of professionals in different sectors, such as health,
social welfare, education and the judiciary, along with the strengthening
of community development and leadership.
<LI>Support nongovernmental organizations and self-help movements
that promote healthy lifestyles, specifically those aiming to
prevent or reduce alcohol-related harm.
<LI>Formulate broad-based programmes in Member States, taking
account of the present European Charter on Alcohol; specify clear
targets for and indicators of outcome; monitor progress; and ensure
periodic updating of programmes based on evaluation.

<H4>Notes:</H4>


In this document &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;the Region&quot;
refer to the European Region of the World Health Organization.
<P>
In this document &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;the Region&quot;
refer to the European Region of the World Health Organization.
<P>
Throughout this document where the term &quot;governments&quot;
(&quot;countries&quot;) is used, it will be deemed to include
the European Community within its areas of competence.
<P>
We take particular note of the Basle
Convention on the Control of  Transboundary Movements of Hazardous
Wastes and their Disposal, the Framework Convention on Climate
Change and the Convention on Biodiversity, all of which have now
entered into force, while the provisions of the Montreal Protocol
to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer
have been updated and strengthened. Three new conventions have
been developed under the auspices of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UN/ECE): the Convention on the Protection
and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes,
the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary
Context and the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial
Accidents.
<H2>Second European Conference on Environment and Health, Helsinki,
Finland, 20-22 June 1994</H2>


1. We, the Ministers of the Environment and the Ministers of Health
of the European Member States of the World Health Organization
(WHO) and the Members of the European Commission (EC) responsible
for environment and health, have met here in Helsinki under the
auspices of the Finnish Government and the WHO Regional Office
for Europe, in accordance with the European Charter on Environment
and Health adopted at our First Conference, held in Frankfurt,
Germany in 1989, and the mandate given to us through Agenda 21
adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED) in 1992.
<P>
2. We have a shared goal before us: to improve the living and
health conditions of the present generation, to ensure that the
carrying capacity of nature is not exceeded and that the right
of future generations to a satisfying and productive life is safeguarded.
Sustainable development can only be assured by radical changes
in present patterns of production and consumption. Coexistence
between man and nature is a prerequisite for the future of humankind.
Prosperity and the continuing development of society must be based
on full recognition and sustained protection of the biological
diversity of nature.
<H3>Progress</H3>

<OL>
<LI>This Second Conference takes
place in a politically and economically different Europe from
that of 1989. Major political changes have led to a substantial
increase in the number of European Member States of WHO. Some
countries are torn by armed conflicts. Many now face the problems
of transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. Economic
recession has affected most parts of the Region. In this new geopolitical
setting, a number of related international initiatives are being
taken which address environment and health issues of direct concern
to Europe. We draw attention to the importance of the Environment
for Europe process initiated at Dobris Castle in 1991, which led
to the adoption by the Pan-European Ministerial Conference in
Lucerne in 1993 of the Environmental Action Programme for Central
and Eastern Europe and the elements for a long-term Environmental

<LI>Programme for Europe. The initiatives taken under the Environment
for Europe process and our commitments to action in environment
and health must be mutually supportive and closely related to
the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development established
by United Nations General Assembly resolution. It is only in this
way that the European family can make a common and coherent response
to the challenges of environment, health and development.
</OL>


4. We are satisfied that the most important decisions of our First
Conference have been followed through. Many countries now base
their policies on health and the environment on the European Charter.
A WHO European Centre for Environment and Health (WHO/ECEH) is
established and operational. In preparing the report Concern for
Europe's Tomorrow (CET), the Centre developed a comprehensive
regional analysis which gives an overall assessment of health
in relation to the environment.
<P>
5. In 1993 the World Health Assembly adopted a Global Strategy
on Health and Environment in response to the recommendation of
the WHO Commission on Health and Environment and the results of
the UNCED. This provides a unifying framework for objectives and
actions in the area of health and environment.
<H3>The challenge in environment and health</H3>


6. We note that the nature and extent of issues requiring preventive
or remedial action have been highlighted by the work carried out
in preparation both of the CET report and the Pan-European State
of the Environment Report prepared under the Environment for Europe
process (Both reports are being finalized for publication later
in 1994.). We are disturbed at the serious consequences for the
health and wellbeing of large numbers of people within the European
Region resulting from unsatisfactory living, working and recreational
environments, such as:
<H4>Contaminated food and water</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Four years after the end of the United Nations International
Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade, over 100 million
people in the Region lack access to reliable supplies of safe
drinking water and an even greater number are not provided with
sanitation services.
<LI>Waterborne infections such as hepatitis A and diarrhoeal diseases
are a major problem in the eastern parts of the Region where,
in addition to difficulties in provision of reliable supplies,
inadequate water treatment and maintenance of distribution systems
result in microbiological contamination of the water supply.
<LI>Illnesses due to microbiological contamination of food are
increasing throughout the Region owing to unwise or deficient
practices and technologies in food production, processing and
storage.
<LI>Some 130 million people a year are estimated to be at risk
of disease due to Salmonella and Campylobacter alone.
</UL>

<H4>Ambient and indoor air pollution</H4>

<UL>
<LI>The respiratory systems of millions living in some urban areas
are at risk because of the levels of ambient air pollution from
existing power plants, industry and growing vehicular traffic.
<LI>Indoor air pollution, including pollution from tobacco smoke
and from radon, aggravated by the lack of adequate ventilation,
is increasingly recognized as a cause of ill health.
<LI>Air pollution may be a cause of reported increases in asthma
attacks and other allergic reactions.
<LI>In some areas, emissions of lead from industry and from vehicles
using leaded gasoline cause blood levels of lead in young children
which may be associated with impaired mental development.
</UL>

<H4>Death and injuries from all forms of accident, including nuclear
emergencies</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Within the Region, road, home and occupational accidents are
the cause of over 200&nbsp;000 deaths each year and a large number
of injuries and permanent disabilities. Environmental factors
contribute to many of these accidents; their incidence could be
reduced by effective preventive measures.
<LI>Eight years after Chernobyl, the design and operational condition
of many nuclear power plants are still in need of urgent improvement
in order to prevent another such accident.
<LI>Already, in some areas affected by the Chernobyl accident,
the frequency of thyroid cancer in children has risen about one
hundredfold; many more people are suffering from psychosomatic
disorders brought on by the accident and uncertainties as to its
long-term effects on their health.
<LI>Some countries, seeking a guarantee against major disasters
and the resulting threats to human health or for other reasons,
have adopted an energy policy which excludes nuclear power.
</UL>

<H4>  - Ecology and health</H4>

<UL>
<LI>A number of major policy decisions in the past, such as those
relating to the development of the Aral Sea basin for intensive
agriculture and the use of Semipalatinsk for nuclear weapons testing,
have created situations which are today hazardous to the health
of millions of people.
</UL>

<H4>Urban health</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Deteriorating living conditions in many urban areas have adverse
effects on the health of large numbers of citizens. Structural
and technological change in the economy has resulted in unacceptably
high levels of unemployment, especially among young people, which
can have adverse effects on physical and mental
<LI>health. Levels of deprivation and squalor are already unacceptable
in many places. Lack of action on these issues could threaten
the very cohesion of our society.
</UL>

<H4>Occupational health</H4>

<UL>
<LI>About half the workers out of a total of 400&nbsp;million
in the Region do not have access to adequate occupational health
services.
<LI>There are 25 000 fatal accidents at work each year, together
with an estimated 10&nbsp;million injuries.
<LI>About 16&nbsp;million workers may be exposed to carcinogenic
agents.
</UL>

<H4>Consequences of armed hostilities</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Armed conflicts have created very large numbers of refugees
and resulted in the destruction and disruption of water supplies
and other essential environmental health services, threatening
the health of entire communities.
</UL>

<H2>Commitment to action</H2>


7. In implementing this Declaration, we will follow the recommendations
of the 1992 report of the WHO Commission on Health and Environment,
which emphasized that there is complementarity, not conflict,
in the promotion of health and the protection of the environment.
The WHO Commission's concept has been endorsed by the Commission
on Sustainable Development, which has stressed the need to integrate
health, environment and development goals and activities: we will
be guided by its decisions as these relate to environment and
health in Europe. We recognize that the need for better utilization
of the limited resources available within and to countries calls
for extended and intensified international cooperation. Sustainability
must be built into the strategies of all sectors; the real cost
of utilization of scarce non-renewable resources must be made
transparent.
<P>
8. We shall abide by the policies and principles embodied in the
European Targets for Health for All and the European Charter on
Environment and Health, especially its provisions for preventive
measures. We pledge ourselves to act:
<UL>
<LI>to maintain <B>solidarity</B>, both within and among nations,
by our participation in collaborative efforts to improve environmental
health and by giving priority to conditions in the worst affected
areas of the Region;
<LI>to ensure <B>sustainability</B> in development, through appropriate
action in the environment and health sectors, in order to meet
the needs of the present population without compromising the ability
of future generations to meet theirs;
<LI>to practice <B>cooperation</B> and <B>partnership</B>, in
pursuit of improvements in environment and health, not only between
the health and environmental sectors but also with other economic
sectors and with all social partners having contributions to make
in setting targets and implementing plans;
<LI>to apply the principle of <B>subsidiarity</B>, in order to
ensure that in all circumstances decisions are made at the most
effective level.
</UL>


9. Member States decide their priorities in the light of their
own situations, but there are certain issues such as water and
air quality which, because of the severity or scale of the problems
caused, demand the attention of all countries. We endorse the
Environmental Health Action Plan for Europe (EHAPE) as the means
through which we may protect and promote health and conserve and
improve the environment. We are committed to implementing its
major thrusts, as follows:
<H3>Country, regional and local actions</H3>


10. We commit our respective health and environment departments
to developing jointly, not later than 1997, action plans on health
and the environment, working with and through competent authorities
or inviting them to draw up such action plans where appropriate
and legally or constitutionally required. These plans should be
integrated in or closely linked with both environmental action
programmes and with health planning processes, and specifically
the action plans required by the UNCED follow-up and the Environment
for Europe process. We will intensify cooperation with other governmental
authorities, such as those responsible for agriculture, energy,
industry, transport and tourism, in order to integrate environment
and health issues into their existing policies, as an important
step towards sustainability.
<P>
11. We are convinced that there is a pressing need for a more
comprehensive, integrated approach to creating healthy and ecologically
sound local communities and for a much better understanding of
the interplay of the many factors contributing to their wellbeing.
We will act in response to UNCED's call for countries &quot;to
develop plans for priority actions based on cooperative planning
by the various levels of government, nongovernmental organizations
and local communities&quot;.
<H3>Transfrontier and Europe-wide actions</H3>

<OL>
<LI>In order to ensure that health
considerations are given appropriate weight in determining action
to be taken, we request WHO, in partnership with other relevant
international organizations, to intensify its contribution to
the further elaboration and implementation of provisions regarding
air, water and soil pollution in those environmental conventions
which have among their aims the protection of human health. This
should include the development of mechanisms for effective implementation
in countries. Such mechanisms for effective implementation are
legislation; the assignment of responsibilities, including those
for coordination between environmental and health sectors; and
ensuring that levels of pollutants in air, water, soil and food
are monitored for the purpose of achieving and sustaining reductions
of exposure. Having in mind potential health effects, we recommend
that, wherever pollution across borders is known to make a significant
contribution to total exposure, efforts made should ensure that
sources of pollutants are adequately controlled.
</OL>

<P>
Note: In particular, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary
Air Pollution and its related protocols as well as the Convention
on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International
Lakes; the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a
Transboundary Context; the Convention on the Transboundary Effects
of Industrial Accidents; the International Atomic Energy Agency
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and the
International Atomic Energy Agency Convention on Nuclear Safety
which is open for signature.
<P>
13. We give our support to WHO's environmental health programme
in Europe and to all other related European programmes designed
to develop and strengthen environmental health management. We
place special emphasis on actions for the improvement of essential
environmental health services including occupational health, information
systems, systems for risk assessment and management, professional
training, and public awareness and participation.
<P>
14. We resolve, as a matter of urgency, to develop increased European
collaboration on defining interrelationships between the urban
environment and health. Innovative approaches to and measures
for empowering inhabitants to develop their living environments
are now required, to reverse the negative trends in the quality
of life which are being experienced in many cities. In order to
stimulate action on environmental, health and social problems,
we strongly support efforts to improve urban living conditions
through the activities of the Europe-wide &quot;Healthy Cities&quot;
and other such networks.
<P>
15. We undertake to strengthen coordinated action in our countries
to reduce the growing toll of human lives taken by accidents.
As a first step, we propose that consideration should be given
to the collection, on a uniform basis throughout the Region, of
information on the environmental and behavioural causes of different
categories of accidents, in order to determine where remedial
action can most usefully be applied.
<P>
16. We call on WHO to collaborate with other organizations in
the establishment or strengthening of effective preventive measures,
including the use of early warning systems and appropriate public
health counter-measures, so that potentially affected countries
can take timely action.
<P>
17. We recognize that the scientific basis for action on some
problems of concern to us needs to be strengthened. To this end,
we endorse the proposal for a joint programme of research involving
 the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Science Foundation
and the European Commission. We agree that the establishment of
a regular series of international meetings to share the results
of this programme and other research would be valuable.
<H3>Actions to support countries in transition and those suffering
from the results of armed conflict</H3>


18. We stand ready to respond to requests from countries in economic
and social transition which may need assistance to make improvements
in their environmental health services, both bilaterally and through
existing international mechanisms. We pledge support to programmes
aimed at remedying specific environmental situations in relation
to health in those countries where internationally based action
is warranted, with particular reference to international agreements
already reached. We request WHO, in partnership with other international
organizations and funding agencies, to develop and coordinate
the health dimensions of such programmes in concert with the Environmental
Programme for Europe and in liaison with the implementation of
the Environmental Action Programme for Central and Eastern Europe,
as well as international river basin, enclosed seas and other
subregional action programmes.
<P>
19. We acknowledge that external assistance will be effective
only if countries' efforts are directed to enhancing and as necessary
reforming environmental health services and information systems,
training environmental health professionals and building public
awareness. We pledge support to the continuation of technical
assistance, for which the National Integrated Programmes on Environment
and Health, developed by WHO/ECEH, may serve as a model.
<P>
20. Aware that many cities and towns in countries in transition
suffer from poorly maintained public services, we call on WHO
and other organizations concerned to give priority to the low-visibility
but important task of rehabilitating services such as those for
water supply and water and waste treatment that are essential
to health. In view of the long neglect of these services in many
countries, we stress the need for adequate training of the staff
responsible for their efficient operation and proper maintenance.
In pursuing these objectives, countries should draw on the Action
Plan on Drinking Water and Sanitation adopted by the Commission
on Sustainable Development.
<P>
21. We express our horror at the hostilities and civil strife
in the disputed areas of the Region, which have already resulted
in hundreds of thousands of people being killed, many more wounded
and millions displaced. We acknowledge the urgent need for our
solidarity to be expressed in operational terms, in order to hasten
the return of the survivors of the hostilities to normal life.
We support and strongly encourage the intensification of actions
taken by WHO, in cooperation with other United Nations bodies,
relief organizations and individual Member States of WHO, to protect
public health conditions in the countries and areas that are now
or have recently been the theatre of armed hostilities. The task
of restoring healthy living conditions will be even more daunting.
We request WHO, in close cooperation with Member States and all
relevant organizations, including funding agencies, to start now
to contribute to planning the major efforts that will be required
to alleviate adverse health conditions and restore basic environmental
health services once peace is achieved.
<H2>Institutional support</H2>

<OL>
<LI>We recognize that the successful
sustained implementation of EHAPE is dependent on collaboration
between the partners in the Environment for Europe process and
the WHO Regional Organization for Europe, utilizing existing coordinating
mechanisms so far as possible.
</OL>


Note: The term &quot;regional organization&quot; (WHO Constitution
Chapter 11, Articles  44-53) refers collectively to the separate
but interactive roles and responsibilities of WHO Member States,
the Regional Committee and the Regional Office.
<P>
23. We have judged that fulfilment of EHAPE will require its own
machinery. To harness the cooperation and involvement of Member
States through their ministries of the environment and of health,
together with relevant international organizations and funding
agencies, in the fulfilment of EHAPE we resolve that a European
Environment and Health Committee (EEHC) be established.
<P>
24. We consider that the Committee should comprise four representatives
designated by the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, four representatives
selected by the UN/ECE Committee on Environmental Policy and,
subject to the approval of the respective institutions, representatives
designated by UN/ECE, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
WHO, EC, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and possibly other intergovernmental
organizations and international funding agencies.
<P>
25. The Committee will become operational with effect from 1 January
1995, the membership initially comprising the representatives
of those bodies specifically mentioned above that have been nominated
by that time, thereby confirming the acceptance by those bodies
of the functions of the Committee as proposed below.
<P>
26. A secretariat will be provided by the WHO Regional Office
for Europe alone or in cooperation with one or more of the other
organizations involved.
<P>
27. We agree that the functions of EEHC will be:
<UL>
<LI>To promote the concept of sustainability as it is to be applied
in relation to environment and health.
<LI>to coordinate and evaluate the implementation of EHAPE;
<LI>when requested by countries, to facilitate and support the
development of environmental health action plans, including assistance
in analysis of the economic, environment and health implications
of particular policy and intervention options; and to assist in
the identification of external resources for the development of
plans;
<LI>to cooperate with the bodies of the Environment for Europe
process, in order to promote the inclusion of actions addressing
health issues in, or their close linkage with, action plans for
the environment and to promote and facilitate development of joint
projects by international organizations at European level in support
of EHAPE;
<LI>to provide advice on environmental health issues to organizations
and donors ready to support countries in economic transition or
recovering from the effects of armed hostilities;
<LI>to assist in the identification of emerging environmental
health issues that require collaborative action or further study;
<LI>to promote a common research policy involving continuing collaboration
between the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Science
Foundation and other appropriate bodies that might wish to be
involved, such as EC;
<LI>to foster information exchange and dissemination.
</UL>


28. We request that EEHC should report annually on EHAPE implementation
to the WHO Regional Committee for Europe and through the UN/ECE
Senior Governmental Officials, Environment for Europe to the UN/ECE
Committee on Environmental Policy.
<P>
29. We resolve that EEHC will be established initially for a period
of five years. An evaluation of its achievements and of its future
potential will be made and a report submitted to our Third Ministerial
Conference.
<P>
30. We propose that WHO/ECEH, working closely with the European
Environment Agency and with other intergovernmental and nongovernmental
organizations, should be recognized as the principal technical
instrument for providing support to EHAPE and as the principal
executive arm of EEHC on technical issues. The Centre should,
to the extent that resources permit, respond to the needs of Member
States and to requests from EEHC in such fields as:
<UL>
<LI>technical cooperation with individual Member States in the
European Region of WHO in relation to the implementation of EHAPE
and specific environmental health issues, in close coordination
with multilateral and bilateral funding agencies;
<LI>development of a comprehensive environmental health information
system capable of identifying priority issues, risk factors and
trends and measuring impact of interventions;
<LI>contribution to the  development of scientific environmental
health criteria and guidelines as a basis for the assessment of
levels of safety and the definition of European norms and standards;
<LI>provision of guidance on environmental health research and
development priorities aimed at effective action and, in close
cooperation with other international bodies, at securing the optimal
deployment of funding and resources that such research and development
require.
</UL>


31. We consider that the capacity of WHO/ECEH to provide support
to Member States of WHO and to EEHC in the implementation of EHAPE
should be strengthened. We will endeavour to ensure that requisite
resources for this purpose are made available alongside the valuable
contributions now provided principally by France, Italy, the Netherlands
and WHO itself.
<H2>Conclusions</H2>


32. We are encouraged by the progress achieved since the adoption
of the European Charter on Environment and Health in 1989 but
remain concerned about the continuing need for vigilance and improvement.
We welcome the support of our partners in Europe and in the international
community. We note with satisfaction the resolution of the European
Parliament submitted to this Conference. We are confident that
collectively we have the will, the means and the commitment to
succeed in these endeavours.
<P>
33. We request the WHO Regional Office for Europe to convene a
Third European Conference on Environment and Health in 1999, to
review progress, particularly the implementation of EHAPE, and
to set the agenda for environment and health in the early years
of the twenty-first century.

<h3>Environment and health policy</h3>

Environmental Health Policy helps Member States to integrate the principles and decisions of UNCED Agenda 21, Rio, 1992, the Helsinki Declaration on Environment and Health, 1994 and the "Environment for Europe" process into the development and implementation of National Environmental Health Action Plans (NEHAPs).
<P>
The programme comprises of the following areas and activities:
<UL>

<li>NEHAPs, including NEHAP pilot project, NEHAP Pan-European meetings for senior officials, sub-regional collaboration in support to NEHAP, and collaboration with the NEAP process
<li>international actions on common and transfrontier issues in support to NEHAPs, including development of guidelines on the development of NEHAPs, public information and participation, reform of the environmental health institutional infrastructures, environmental health financing and collaboration of environmental health sector with economic sectors
<li>projects in support to countries in transition, including identification of technical and financial assistance to CCEE  and NIS countries from donors, the World Bank and EU programmes.
</ul>
<h3>Environment and Health Services</H3>
<a href="../tpeh03.htm"><b>See Environment and health briefing pamphlets for local authorities</b></A>
<p>Targets 18 and 19 of health for all strategy call on each Member State to design an environment and health policy and to have adequate strategies and instruments to implement this policy. In support of this, the environment and health policy programme focuses on three main activities:
<ul>
<li>support to Member States in developing national  and local environment and health action plans.
<li>development of reference documents for environmental health services: Policy options, staffing, training, evaluation, legal and economic instruments
<li>provision of a multilingual series of technical pamphlets covering all aspects of environmental health.

<H2>Bilthoven
Operational Division</H2>


The priority areas of the Bilthoven division consist of the establishment
of a health and environment geographical information system (HEGIS),
assessment of health effects from air pollution in Europe, environmental
epidemiology, toxicology and chemical safety (including emergency
response to chemical accidents), and technical cooperation with
the countries of central and eastern Europe


<H3>Chemical safety
</H3>

The chemical safety programme aims at the environmentally sound management of chemicals. A main activity is the derivation of <a href="airqual.htm"><B>air quality guidelines for Europe.</B></A> These guidelines will help Member States to set harmonized standards. In addition, the programme will address indoor air quality. In the field of risk assessment for dioxins and related compounds, the programme is evaluating the tolerable daily intake and the health risk of infants exposed through human milk as well as in utero, updating and revising internationally agreed toxic equivalency factors, and carrying out quality assessment studies. Planned activities on the international level include evaluating the risk of environmental pollutants acting as endocrine disrupters, and developing and improving poison control facilities and programmes in the European Region, particularly in eastern countries.



<H3>Environmental Epidemiology</H3>


The environmental epidemiology programme assesses the impact of
environmental factors on health of the population. Activities
focus on the health effects of air pollution and the development
of epidemiological methods to improve assessment. The programme
reviews methods of exposure assessment (including biomarkers),
exposure to indoor air pollution, epidemiological approaches to
the analysis of the health effects of major chemical incidents
and the role of epidemiology in health impact assessment. To increase
professional capacities in the Region, national and international
training courses (including a two-week summer school) are organized,
and a network of environmental epidemiologists (GEENET-Euro),
is maintained.
<H3>Environment and Health Information Systems</H3>


The Health and Environment Geographical Information
System (HEGIS) for Europe is being developed to improve understanding
of the current situation and thus allow a more rational approach
to evaluating health as related to the environment. The ultimate
goals are to identify priority issues and risk factors, to forecast
trends and to measure the impact of interventions. HEGIS consists
of two databases with gender- and age-specific information on
population and mortality in the Member States of the WHO European
Region for 1980/1981 and 1990/1991 on subnational levels, and
information on air quality from 1975 up to 1995 for the European
Union and the European Region.
<H3>Occupational Health</H3>


The occupational health programme focuses on four major areas:

<UL>
<LI>policy development and national capacity building in promotion
of healthy working environments and practices;
<LI>national capacity building in maintenance of working ability
and workplace health promotion;
<LI>guidelines for implementation of quality assurance and quality
management in providing occupational safety and health services;
and
<LI>development of occupational health information system and
a core set of indicators on working environments and workers'
health
</UL>

<H2>Nancy Project
Office</H2>
<h4><a href="nancylet.htm">Nancy newsletter</A></h4>

The Nancy project office provides technical cooperation with local
authorities in central and eastern Europe by studying technological
projects in the fields of water, solid wastes,  soil contamination,
air pollution, and urban planning and public health.
<H3>Water Supply and Sanitation</H3>


The water supply and sanitation programme provides assistance
to local authorities in the European Region. These activities
include assessing existing situations, identifying priorities
for upgrading water management, organizing training, providing
technical advice to regional and municipal bodies, and responding
to outbreaks of waterborne disease.
<H3>Solid Waste Management and Soil Pollution</H3>


Technical advice and direct in-the-field assistance is provided
to ministries, municipalities and organizations on practical problems
affecting public health that arise from household, health care
or industrial (hazardous) wastes, as well as contaminated land.
Most activities take place in eastern Europe, the former USSR
and some eastern Mediterranean countries. They include policy
and regulation advice, technical and economic feasibility studies,
equipment assessments, implementation of waste improvement projects
in cities, and emergency help in areas of conflict and disaster.
<H3>Urban Development</H3>


The urban development programme helps cities and towns in Member
States improve conditions that could affect people's health and
quality of life. It focuses on healthy, sustainable urban planning
and housing, and the organization of technical services in communities.
The programme also contributes to the Healthy Cities project by
focusing on conceptual work in urban health policy and promoting
an integrative approach according to the principles and commitments
of Agenda 21.
<H2>Rome Operational
Division</H2>


The Rome division focuses on environmental epidemiology, food
safety, project management for environment and health, radiation,
and water and wastes.
<H3>Environmental Epidemiology</H3>


The programme supports epidemiological aspects of environmental
health impact assessment and policy in the Region by making country
and regional assessments, reviewing emerging issues, developing
human resources and taking preventive action. Current projects
focus on:
<UL>
<LI>health effects of the atomic bomb testing in Semipalatinsk,
Kazakstan
<LI>health consequences of the drying up of the Aral Sea
<LI>cholera epidemics in Europe
<LI>catalogue of studies on health effects of Chernobyl
<LI>health effects of arsenic in drinking-water in Hungary and
Romania.
</UL>

<H3>Food safety</H3>


The food safety programme makes available scientifically sound
information on the levels of contamination of food items and the
related risks to human health. It operates mainly through two
large networks of European institutions:
<UL>
<LI>the European programme on monitoring and assessment of dietary
exposure to hazardous substances (GEMS/Food Euro) for chemical
contamination; and
<LI>the WHO surveillance programme for control of foodborne infections
and intoxications in Europe.
</UL>

<H3>Project Management for Environment and Health</H3>


This programme focuses on two areas: development of reports on
environmental health in countries, and sustainable development
programmes.
<P>
Country reports are based on the information already available
and help to establish environmental health information systems,
to develop collaboration among different sectors at the national
and international levels, and to identify priorities for national
environmental health action plans. An innovative approach has
been developed to support sustainable human development in war-torn
countries through:
<UL>
<LI>capacity and institution building;
<LI>supporting the expansion of cooperation between local communities
in donor and recipient countries; and
<LI>involving local public and private institutions in carrying
out regional development plans.
</UL>

<H3>Radiation</H3>


The radiation programme deals with the public health aspects of
environmental radiation exposure and comprises two main branches.
The first, in partnership with the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC), is the International Thyroid Project. Inaugurated
in 1994, it helps Belarus to address the public health implications
of the increase in thyroid disease following the Chernobyl accident.
The second is a nuclear emergency preparedness programme to help
countries to develop public health contingency plans and nuclear
emergency response in the event of a nuclear accident or radiological
emergency.
<H3>Water and Wastes</H3>


The water and wastes programme supports countries through:
<UL>
<LI>advisory activities;
<LI>definition of priorities and strategy, for both operations
and research and development;
<LI>projects in countries; and
<LI>transfrontier issues related to major bodies of water (the
Danube river, the Black Sea, the Aral Sea, the Caspian Sea, etc.).
</UL>


The programme is preparing guidelines for the quality of recreational
waters and bathing beaches, and taking part in the rolling revision
of the WHO guidelines for drinking-water quality.

This report aims at presenting the latest available data on the
coverage of needs for vaccines in the Newly Independent States
(NIS) and the Baltic States (with the exception of the Russian
Federation) in 1995. It is focused on a selection of vaccines
in agreement with the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)
i.e. BCG, DPT, DT, OPV and measles vaccine (Lithuania uses both
IPV and OPV). The report is based on data collected from the Ministries
of Health, Epidemiological and Statistical Departments, by the
WHO Euro ISMS on a quarterly basis in 1995. All figures used in
the report are in number of doses.

<P>
In the report, the estimations of Primary Immunization Needs In
1995 established in January 1995 by the Ministries of Health are
presented in parallel with the estimations drawn up by WHO EURO.
A number of factors account for the many discrepancies which may
be found in the majority of the countries and for each vaccine
between the estimations: differences in the estimations of the
sizes of the target populations, and differences in the estimations
of vaccine wastage factors. In addition in a few instances in
1995 some countries had not yet modified their national immunization
schedule in agreement with the EPI recommendations.
<P>
According to their national immunization schedule Other Non-Primary
Immunization Needs have been estimated by the countries in the
beginning of 1995. These estimates as far as BCG, DPT and measles
are concerned did not conform with the EPI recommendations. Additional
Needs were reported such as was the case with OPV in the context
of the Mecacar operation from the majority of the participating
countries (with the exception of Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan) in
the beginning of 1995. Additional needs for diphtheria epidemic
control activities which included DT and Td vaccines were reported
in the beginning of 1995 by the majority of countries. They are
presented in parallel with the estimates from the joint UN appeal
which was launched in June 1995.

<P>
With regard to the supply situation, there is no vaccine production
in any of the NIS nor Baltic States, with the exception of BCG
being produced in Uzbekistan which accounts for the 20.804.220
doses reported in the ad hoc table (page 3). Vaccine supplies
reported by countries in 1995 include vaccine in-stock in the
beginning of 1995, purchases and donations. The accuracy of the
information on supplies provided to the ISMS by countries varies
considerably between countries and for each country between vaccines.
In a number of situations UNICEF appears to have been the only
supplier of vaccines e.g. BCG in Azerbaijan. In some instances
the volume of each vaccine (in number of doses) reported by UNICEF
to the ISMS exceeds the amount declared by the country e.g. Tajikistan,
Belarus (DT), Azerbaijan (OPV). Nonetheless in the majority of
the countries the opposite situation may be found and the volume
of supplies stated by the Ministries of Health exceeds the volume
of supplies provided through UNICEF as countries have received
other donations (IFRC, etc) and sometimes purchased large quantities
of vaccines e.g. Baltic States (UNICEF has supplied vaccines to
Latvia only), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan.

<P>
More detailed information on the status of needs and supplies
in each country in 1995, including epidemiological data, is available
in the ad hoc country specific annual reports which may obtained
on request addressed to the ISMS.

This summary report aims at presenting the status of drugs needs
and supplies for life saving drugs in 1995 in the Newly Independent
States (NIS), with the exception of the Russian Federation. It
is the result of a compilation of data on drugs needs, stocks,
production and purchases and donations collected all through 1995
on a quarterly basis by the WHO Europe Information Service on
Medical Supplies (ISMS) from the Ministries of Health. The framework
for data collection is based on a list of life saving drugs drawn
up by the WHO-EURO Pharmaceuticals Unit with reference to the
Model List of Essential Drugs (Seventh List) established by WHO
headquarters in 1992.

<P>
All figures used in the report are in number of doses. The absence
of identified needs for a specific drug by a country in 1995 is
noted as '-'; full coverage of identified needs in 1995 by existing
stocks and/or supplies procured in 1995 is noted as 'covered'.


<P>
No data regarding the status of drugs supplies in the last quarter
of 1995 has been received from Azerbaijan and Tajikistan who previously
reported regularly to the WHO EURO. This reflects very much the
increasing difficulties met by the majority of the countries who
participated in the data collection process in 1995 in assessing
and following up the actual drugs needs and levels of supplies
in the context of the political reforms which are affecting the
health sector at large and more specifically the pharmaceuticals
sector. Nonetheless there is strong evidence that life saving
drugs needs were not covered in the majority of the NIS in 1995
and that donors assistance remains indispensable.

<P>
For your information a more detailed description of each country's
drugs needs and supplies status in 1995, including epidemiological
data, is available in the ad hoc country specific annual reports
which may obtained on request addressed to the ISMS. The next
ISMS report on the 1996 annual projected status of drugs needs
and supplies in the NIS will be available in the near future.

</h4>
The following report describes the needs for a selection of basic
medical equipment in health care services at district level in
8 of the Newly Independent States (NIS), namely Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine.
As far as the basic medical equipment needs in Latvia are concerned
information has been collected from Jekabpils district (60.000
inhabitants) only. The report has been established with a view
to providing donor organizations with information on some of the
very basic and uncovered needs in these countries. It is a result
of a compilation of data on estimated annual needs and foreseen
imports (purchases and pledged donations) due to take place between
May and December 1995. Data have been collected by the Information
Service on Medical Supplies (ISMS) from the Ministries of Health
in March-April of this year.
<P>
The framework for data collection derives from WHO Headquarters
1991 guidelines on &quot;surgery at the district hospital: obstetrics,
gynaecology, orthopaedics and traumatology&quot;. These guidelines
set out recommendations on minimum standards for basic medical
equipment (including anaesthetic instruments and devices) required
in district hospitals for the performance of basic general surgery
and other basic surgery.

<P>
The report is divided into three sections :

<ul>
<li>needs for reusable basic surgical instrumentation and devices
for the performance of basic general surgery and other basic surgery
(vascular, abdominal, gynaecology, orthopaedic, otorinolaryngology,
urogenital) including anaesthetic instruments.

<li>needs for other reusable instruments relating to surgical and
clinical practice.

<li>needs for basic consumables including some invitro devices and
contraceptives.
</ul>

Needs are expressed in numbers of units or sets of units according
to the description of each equipment.
<P>
Information on <A HREF="serv95.htm" >health care services </A>at
district and sub-district levels in the designated Newly Independent
States in 1995 is attached to the report.

<H3><a name="a1">Air and health</A>
</H3>
Heating for homes and businesses, the generation of electrical
power, also for homes and industry, and the huge growth in road
traffic have all led to poorer air quality in many of Europe's
cities and towns. However, air pollution and its damaging effects
on health were recognised as long ago as the 13th century though
many years passed before any progress in pollution control was
made.  Indeed, during the Industrial Revolution in European countries
and elsewhere, pollution was seen as an inevitable accompaniment
of industrial development; little effort was made to regulate
emissions with the result that bronchitis and other respiratory
diseases were widespread. During the last forty years or so many
countries have introduced laws to control pollution from all sources
and thus reduce its effects on health. Despite this  WHO estimates
that about 1.6 billion people world-wide are exposed to air which
is polluted.
<P>
Sources of air pollution have changed with economic development;
whilst the use of coal for domestic heating was once the dominant
source of pollution, exhaust from motor vehicles is, in many cities,
now a major concern. In many Eastern parts of Europe and other
parts of the world domestic heating is still an important source,
along with industrial emissions; economic development here is
also resulting in increased numbers of vehicles and pollution

<P>
Local authorities have an important role to play in reducing levels
of air pollution and in encouraging public awareness of how many
of our day to day activities contribute to local air pollution.
This pamphlet provides an overview of the main pollutants affecting
local air quality, their sources and their effects on health;
a brief description of monitoring is given and some suggestions
made for improving local air quality. Further pamphlets will take
up some of these points in greater detail.

<H3><a name="sick">Sick building syndrome</A>
</H3>
Sick building syndrome (SBS) describes a medical condition in
which people in a building suffer from symptoms of illness or
feeling unwell for no apparent reason. The symptoms tend to increase
in severity with the time people spend in the building, and improve
over time or even disappear when people are away from the building.
<P>
SBS results in substantial disruption of people's work performance
and personal relationships,, and considerable loss of productivity.
<P>
SBS is wide spread and may occur in offices, apartment houses, nurseries and schools, resulting in substantial costs to the community. Even though the cause-effect relations are unclear, it is possible to modify buildings with SBS problems, and new buildings have a good chance of avoiding these problems.
<P>
Local government can both implement curative measures and take
preventive actions. These measures and actions range from the
simple to the radical.

What is a Rodent ?
<P>
Rodents are mammals and there are about 1700 species in the world.
 Most of these never come into conflict with man.
<P>
The commensal rodent are those species which have biological requirements
that match mans and are able to thrive in the countryside, farms,
villages, towns and cities that man creates.  There are very few
in Europe but they can cause a great number of problems.
<P>
All rodents have specialized teeth (Fig.1) and in particular the
adaptation of the incisor teeth for gnawing.  Both the upper and
lower jaw of all rodents have single pairs of incisors, which
grow throughout the animals life.  This, combined with a hard
enamel outer coat enables the development of a sharp cutting edge.
<P>
These highly specialized teeth, combined with their adaptive behaviour
are the main reasons for the success of the rodents.

<hr>
<H3><a name="cockroaches">Cockroaches</A>
</H3>
House cockroaches have followed man since antiquity. Today, they present an important problem in terms of hygiene and health, as well as being a domestic and industrial pest.
<P>
For reasons both technical and economic, it is extremely difficult to eradicate populations of cockroaches. It is however possible to keep their excessive development in check.
<P>
Infestation by cockroaches can be prevented by impeding their spread over large distances. On the other hand the way houses are built can be modified. The active involvement of all people living in an area infested by cockroaches is the cornerstone of any strategy aiming at controlling the population of these pests.




<hr>

<H3><a name="birds">Birds</A> in urban environment
</H3>

It is fortunate that birds could adapt to the city. In the same way as flowers or trees, their presence allow the rising numbers of city-dwellers to keep in touch with the nature which they so cruelly miss at this end of the 20th century.
<P>
A bird is an object of beauty which evokes feelings of freedom and thoughts of faraway travels. It brings a touch of happiness, especially to children whom it amuses or surprises, or to elderly people, who might feel less lonely for its presence.
<P>
It is, however, undeniable that birds in a city also create various problems, which are presented in this document.

</H3>
Radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is present everywhere on the surface of the earth. It can accumulate and reach high concentrations in buildings. Studies in recent decades have shown that inhaling radon at high concentrations very greatly increases the risk of lung cancer. The results to date support the view that, in some regions of Europe, radon may be the second most important cause of lung cancer.
<P>
	We have the means of taking action. Local authorities can and must play an essential role. Three main approaches can be identified:
<ul>
<li>gaining a better understanding of the local situation concerning the risk related to radon;
<li>providing the public with information;
<li>helping to implement solutions to the radon problem as soon as it is identified.
</ul>

	The earth's crust contains variable quantities of radioactive elements, including uranium. The basic common feature of all radioactive elements is that they are "unstable": they disintegrate and, in so doing, generate new particles (both radioactive and non-radioactive) and radiation. One of the products of the breakdown of uranium is radon. Radon is a radioactive, odourless and colourless gas. It diffuses from the earth in larger or smaller quantities, depending on the nature and texture of the soil. It is sometimes found dissolved in water.

<H3><a name="radiation">Before, during</A> and after radiation emergencies
</H3>
Serious radiation emergencies are very rare events. Nevertheless when they occur, they can cause serious public health problems.  Radiation cannot be detected by human senses.  It cannot be seen, smelt or touched.  Furthermore, as a rule, the public has no experience of dealing with radiation.
<P>
Radiation emergencies can cause great public anxiety and raise urgent questions on a wide range of issues.  These issues include the optimum course of action for individuals and their families, the prospect of future illness or even premature death, the danger to unborn children and the safety of local food and water.
<P>
In most instances, the public will turn first to the local authority, where they will expect to receive accurate information, suitable advice and appropriate assistance.
<P>
This document describes the range of potential radiation emergencies, the likely consequences for health, some possible remedial actions and the outline of an emergency planning process for a public health response.

Lead is toxic to humans. In children, continual exposure at low
levels has been shown to cause mental retardation and behavioural
problems. Owing to the use of lead in pipes for water distribution,
paint, additives in gasoline and other industrial uses, lead has
become a general environmental contaminant.
<P>
There is no safe level of lead in the body. Urgent action by local
governments will help prevent problems to human health and the
environment. This will involve making a survey of blood lead levels
of the young children in the area and then carrying out the appropriate
intervention required. When blood lead levels are above 15 &#181;g/dl,
action should be taken to reduce exposure.

</H3>

In an age and time when three quarters of the European population, and soon half of the population around the world, lives in a city, local authorities are looking to better understand the evolution of towns and the influence of urban living on health.
<P>
Urban development results from the confrontation of local policy with to factors on which it had little influence, such as demography, the mobility of persons and goods, public health, friction, theoretical models and the cultural identity of a town. The local authority can, however, juggle with certain levers, in order to improve living conditions in the town and the health of its citizens.
<P>
Since the industrial revolution, the history of urban development in Europe shows that the various actors are giving ever greater weight to the issue of health. We can learn from this to implement a coordinated action between the various sectors (environment, society, culture, economy) in order to give to each person the means to lead a fully satisfactory life and to enjoy good health.


<HR>
<a name="contaminated"><H3>Contaminated land</H3></A>

Much of the land now becoming available for development within
the urban environment has in the past been used for industrial
or other economic purposes. Indeed, sites which have not had former
industrial use, for example parks, are often protected for public
leisure access, which puts additional pressure on urban planners
and developers to bring former industrial sites back into economic
use.
<P>
The potential that land is contaminated should always be a consideration
in urban planning. This document seeks to identify why this should
be the case, and suggests appropriate strategies and methodologies
for assessing such sites. This pamphlet is not, on its own, sufficient
to provide the skills and knowledge to conduct site contamination
assessments or remediation. It does provide sufficient information
to allow a superficial audit of work done by others to be carried
out, and may also help professionals with existing expertise in
this area.
<P>
In many parts of the European Region, there were few controls
on industrial land use from the start of the Industrial Revolution
until very recently. This has left a legacy of contamination:

<ul>

<li>on or near many sites which have remained active industrial sites;

<li>on derelict sites now being brought back into economic use; and


<li>on former industrial sites which have already been redeveloped
for other purposes such as housing.</ul>

<hr>
<H3><a name="solid">Solid waste and health</A>
</H3>Most human activities create waste. The majority of those wastes are not, in themselves, a potential threat to health but their correct management can help to minimize or avoid associated risks.
<P>
There is no single "correct" way to collect, handle and dispose of wastes, but rather a range of options. These must be tailored to local circumstances, such as the amount and type of waste, regional and climate, and economic conditions.
<P>
Local authorities must encourage the minimization of both the quantity and toxicity of waste as an important first stage. Sound management of the remaining wastes will help to protect the local and global environment.
<P>
This booklet provides an overview of solid waste management.


<H3><a name="incin">Waste incineration</A>
</H3>
The incineration of waste is an hygienic method of reducing its volume and weight which also reduces its potential to pollute. Not all wastes are suitable for combustion. Residues from incineration processes must still be landfilled, as must the non-combustible portion of the waste stream, so incineration alone cannot provide a disposal solution.<P>

Generating electricity or producing hot water or steam as a by-product of the incineration process has the dual advantages of displacing energy generated from finite fossil fuels and improving the economics of waste incineration, which is the most capital-intensive waste disposal option.

<H3><a name="collec">Waste collection</A>
</H3>
An efficient and comprehensive waste collection system is essential
to protect the health of the population. The entire waste management
plan for a city or region depends on the standard of the collection
service. A modern, well managed waste collection and transport
system not only protects the general public from disease but is
also safe and hygienic for everyone working in, or in connection
with, the system. This includes waste generators; collection,
transport and treatment personnel; children and scavengers; and,
indirectly, all inhabitants of the city.
<P>
Waste collection costs can account for half or even more of the
total waste management budget. Good management is therefore beneficial
in economic terms, as well as in environmental and health terms.

<H3><a name="landfill">Landfill</A>
</H3>
Landfill is the oldest and the most widely practised method of
disposing of solid waste. Properly constructed and operated landfill
sites offer a completely safe disposal route for municipal solid
wastes, typically at the lowest cost compared to other disposal
options. It is not necessary on health or environmental grounds
to invest in other disposal methods if suitable sites are available
for landfills. Uncontrolled dumping of waste, which does not protect
the local environment, however, should be replaced as soon as
possible with controlled sanitary landfilling or other treatment
and disposal methods.
<P>
Most alternative waste treatment and disposal options, such as
recycling or incineration, rely on landfill for the disposal of
wastes that are unsuited to the process, as well as for the process
residues. Some landfill capacity is therefore indispensable for
every region, and will continue to be necessary in the foreseeable
future, despite any technological advances which may be made.



<H3><a name="minim">Waste minimization</A>
</H3>
Minimizing waste conserves resources and helps to protect the environment. Waste minimisation measures should not simply address the visible solid waste left after manufacture or use of an item, but must also address all of the resources which are consumed during those processes.
<P>
While recycling can have a positive impact by diverting waste materials from treatment or disposal, strictly speaking recycling is not a waste minimisation process. Waste minimisation involves reducing to the lowest possible level the amount and the toxicity of waste being created.
<P>
Methods to achieve this include changes in manufacturing procedures by industry,  and changes in habits by the public. In addition, making goods which are designed to last longer,  and making it possible to repair them, can delay them becoming waste.

<H3><a name="drink">Drinking-water disinfection</A>
</H3>
Each year, 3 million people throughout the world die as a direct
result of drinking unsafe water. This colossal figure is particularly
worrying when seen in conjunction with the 120 million people
in WHO's European Region who do not currently enjoy an uninterrupted
supply of microbiologically safe drinking-water.
<P>
Local authorities have the prime responsibility for eliminating
this risk and dealing with instances of contamination, which,
even when minimal, may result in catastrophic epidemics. It is
up to them to do everything in their power to provide the population
with a continuous supply of safe water.
<P>
High-quality water can be guaranteed if certain simple rules are
followed. One of these is disinfection of the resource by chlorine.
This must continue to be a priority in every case, taking precedence
over pre-treatment of water using highly specialized and often
expensive techniques.


<H3><a name="protec">Protection of water sources</A>
</H3>
In general, local authorities are responsible for the quality of water distributed to the population. They must ensure that this water is always fit for consumption.
<P>
It is easier to supply the public with water of a satisfactory quality if you are sure that the resources used are, at the outset, free from pollution. One of the requirements for maintaining the natural quality of water sources is to engage in a pro-active policy of protection of water sources.
<P>
The difficulties encountered when establishing protection zones are very similar from one country to another; they may be technical, administrative or financial. The aim of this document is to provide practical guidance which will make easier to establish such protection zones.
<HR>
<H3><a name="wandh">Water and health</A>
</H3>
At the dawn of the 21st century, and even though a large number of countries of the European Region of the World Health Organization are among the more advanced, the distribution of water still remains a problem :
<UL>
<LI>over 10 million Europeans do not have a water tap in their homes, whether the water be drinkable or not;

<LI>cholera, an illness we thought we had conquered, has reappeared and major epidemics have raged through the Region;

<LI>tens of millions of people are supplied with water which meets neither the WHO guidelines nor the national or international standards.

<LI>most countries, it is local authorities who ensure the distribution of drinking-water. They are therefore endowed with a heavy responsibility in terms of public health.
</UL>
This document aims at:
<UL>
<LI>giving a better understanding of the link existing between water and health;
<LI>helping to establish priorities;
<LI>showing how important it is to guarantee to a population, including the less favoured, a permanent supply of good quality water.

<H4>Environmental health briefing pamphlets<BR>
</H4>


Supported by communication and linguistic specialists, the best
available experts have written a series of concise, technically
accurate pamphlets. They aim to inform you of the nature of environmental
risks, and advise you on the different options open to you and
their costs. They will help you to define environmental health
strategies. They will also help you to quickly assess  a situation
on a particular aspect of environmental health, and so, constitute
valuable decision-making tools.

<P>
About a hundred pamphlets, some translated into 20 languages,
should be available by the end of 1997.

<H4>A daily concern for local authorities
</H4>


Quality of urban air, continual provision of safe drinking water,
waste management, urban planning&#133; these are some of the challenges
which confront local authority decision-makers on a daily basis.
The information available is scanty, sometimes unreliable, and
often incomprehensible to the layman.

<P>
Nevertheless, decision have to be made. These pamphlets, being
readily accessible to a wide range of people, will become an indispensable
tool for local authorities and their technical services.
<P>
In Rio, all the agencies of the United Nations received a mandate
to act more closely with local authorities in the area of environment
and health. For WHO in particular, this has been reiterated during
the Helsinki Conference. These pamphlets are an important step
in responding to this mandate.

Le chauffage et la production délectricité - que ce soit pour les foyers ou à destination de lindustrie - ainsi que la croissance rapide de la circulation routière, tous ont contribué à diminuer la qualité de lair dans de nombreuses villes et cités dEurope. Bien que les méfaits de la pollution sur la santé aient été reconnus déjà au 13ème siècle, il a fallu attendre bien des années avant quaucun progrès en matière de réduction de la pollution ne soit réalisé. Et même, cette pollution fut considérée comme un corollaire inévitable du développement au cours de la révolution industrielle en Europe et ailleurs. En conséquence, bien peu defforts furent déployés pour contrôler les émissions, et bronchites et autres maladies respiratoires se répandirent. Ce nest donc quau cours des 40 dernières années environ que les pays ont introduit des lois sur le contrôle de la pollution, quelle que soit son origine, et ont ainsi contribué à réduire ses effets sur la santé. Malgré cela, lOMS chiffre à 1,6 milliard le nombre de personnes exposées à un air pollué.
<P>
Lorigine de la pollution de lair a changé avec la croissance économique. Autrefois, lutilisation du charbon pour le chauffage domestique était lune des origines principales de pollution; aujourdhui ce sont les fumées déchappement qui sont le principal souci dans de nombreuses villes. Dans plusieurs pays dEurope orientale et dautres parties du globe, le chauffage domestique représente toujours une source importante de pollution, de même que lindustrie. Le développement économique de ces régions entraîne également un accroissement du nombre de véhicules, et cette pollution sajoute aux deux autres problèmes.
<P>
Les autorités locales ont un important rôle à jouer pour réduire les niveaux de pollution de lair et encourager la prise de conscience du public en révélant combien nos activités quotidiennes contribuent à la pollution locale. Ce document fournit une présentation générale des agents de pollution principaux agissant sur la qualité de lair au niveau local, leurs origines et leurs effets sur la santé; ensuite, la surveillance est brièvement décrite, pour finir avec quelques suggestions permettant daméliorer la qualité de lair. Dautres documents viendront en complément de celui-ci, et donneront plus de détails sur certains des points évoqués.

Le "Sick Building Syndome" est une affection m&eacute;dicale dans laquelle les personnes r&eacute;sidant dans un b&acirc;timent souffrent de sympt&ocirc;mes ou  prouvent des malaises sans raison apparente. Plus elles passent de temps dans le b&acirc;timent, plus ces sympt&ocirc;mes s'aggravent; en revanche, lorsqu'elles quittent celui-ci, il se produit une am&eacute;lioration et les sympt&ocirc;mes peuvent m&ecirc;me disparaitre.
<P>
Le "Sick Building Syndome" perturbe l'activit&eacute;  professionnelle des personnes touch&eacute;es, nuit   leurs relations personnelles et est   l'origine de pertes de productivit&eacute; consid&eacute;rables.
<P>
Ce syndrome est très répandu et peut se manifester dans des bureaux, des appartements, des pouponni&eacute;res et des  coles, ce qui se traduit par des d&eacute;penses importantes pour la collectivit . Bien que la relation de cause   effet ne  soit pas &eacute;tablie de fa&ccedil;on claire, on sait comment modifier les b&acirc;timents o  ce probl&egrave;me existe et il y a de bonnes chances pour qu'il ne se pose pas dans les nouveaux b&acirc;timents.
<P>
Les collectivit&eacute;s locales peuvent selon les cas prendre des mesures correctives ou agir de fa on pr&eacute;ventive. L'action men&eacute;e peut aller de mesures simples   des mesures radicales.

</H3>
Quest-ce quun rongeur ?
<P>
Les rongeurs sont des mammifères, dont il existe environ 1700 espèces de par le monde. La plupart dentre elles nentre jamais en conflit avec lhomme.
<P>
Le rongeur commensal appartient à une de ces espèces dont les besoins biologiques sont proches de ceux de lhomme, et qui peuvent sépanouir aussi bien à la campagne que dans les fermes, les villages, les villes et les cités que lhomme crée. Il existe très peu despèces de ce genre en Europe, mais elles peuvent causer un grand nombre de problèmes.
<P>
Tous les rongeurs ont une denture spécifique et en particulier possèdent des incisives adaptées pour ronger. La mâchoire supérieure et inférieure des rongeurs contient une paire dincisives, qui croissent tout au long de la vie de lanimal. Grâce à lexistence dune couche externe démail dur, ces dents développent un bord très coupant.
<P>
Cette denture hautement spécialisée, jointe à leur faculté dadaptation, sont la raison principale du succès des rongeurs.




<HR>
<H3><a name="blatte">Les blattes</A>
</H3>Les Blattes domestiques, souvent appel&eacute;es &#171;&nbsp;cafards&nbsp;&#187;
ou &#171;&nbsp;cancrelats&nbsp;&#187;, suivent l'homme depuis
l'Antiquit&eacute;. Elles constituent aujourd'hui un probl&egrave;me
important en termes d'hygi&egrave;ne et de sant&eacute; humaine
et en termes de nuisances domestiques et industrielles.
<P>
A ce jour, pour des raisons techniques et &eacute;conomiques,
il est tr&egrave;s difficile d'&eacute;radiquer d&eacute;finitivement
des populations de Blattes domestiques. Toutefois, il est possible
de contr&ocirc;ler le d&eacute;veloppement excessif de leur populations.
<P>
La pr&eacute;vention de l'infestation par les Blattes doit &ecirc;tre
mise en oeuvre d'une part en interrompant leurs voies de propagation
&agrave; longue distance et d'autre part en modifiant l'am&eacute;nagement
des locaux. La participation active des habitants des zones infest&eacute;es
est un &eacute;l&eacute;ment essentiel de toute strat&eacute;gie
visant au contr&ocirc;le des populations de Blattes.

<HR>
<H3><a name="oise">Les oiseaux dans la ville</A>
</H3>
Il est heureux que des oiseaux aient pu s'adapter &agrave; la
ville. Leur pr&eacute;sence, au m&ecirc;me titre que celle des
fleurs ou des arbres, permet aux citadins - toujours plus nombreux
- de garder un contact avec cette nature qui leur fait tant d&eacute;faut
aux abords du XXI&egrave;me si&egrave;cle.
<P>
L'oiseau est beau et &eacute;voque &agrave; merveille libert&eacute;
et voyages lointains. Il apporte un peu de bonheur, surtout aux
enfants qu'il amuse et &eacute;tonne ou aux personnes &acirc;g&eacute;es
dont il peut contribuer &agrave; adoucir la solitude.
<P>
Il serait toutefois vain de nier que la pr&eacute;sence d'oiseaux
au coeur des villes s'accompagne aussi de probl&egrave;mes divers,
&eacute;voqu&eacute;s dans la pr&eacute;sente publication.

<H3><a name="radon">Le radon</A>
</H3>
Le radon, gaz radioactif d'origine naturelle, est pr&eacute;sent
partout &agrave; la surface de la plan&egrave;te. Il peut s'accumuler
&agrave; des concentrations &eacute;lev&eacute;es dans les b&acirc;timents.
Durant ces derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, des &eacute;tudes
ont montr&eacute; qu'inhaler du radon &agrave; des concentrations
&eacute;lev&eacute;es augmente tr&egrave;s fortement le risque
de cancer du poumon. Les r&eacute;sultats obtenus &agrave; ce
jour permettent de penser que dans certaines r&eacute;gions d'Europe,
le radon serait la deuxi&egrave;me cause de cancer du poumon.
<P>
Les moyens d'agir existent. Les collectivit&eacute;s locales peuvent
et doivent jouer un r&ocirc;le essentiel. Trois principaux axes
d'action peuvent &ecirc;tre d&eacute;gag&eacute;s :
<UL>
<LI>Une meilleure connaissance de la situation locale vis-&agrave;-vis
du risque li&eacute; au radon
<LI>L'information du public
<LI>L'aide &agrave; la mise en oeuvre de solutions au probl&egrave;me
du radon d&egrave;s lors qu'il est mis en &eacute;vidence
</UL>



<H3><a name="avant">Avant, pendant et après un accident nucléaire</A>
</H3>
Une urgence nucléaire sérieuse néclate que très rarement. Cependant, lorsquune telle catastrophe survient, elle peut causer de sérieux dommages pour la santé publique. La radiation ne peut pas être détectée par les sens humains; elle ne peut être ni vue, ni sentie, ni touchée. De plus, le public na généralement aucune expérience dans le comportement à avoir lors dune radiation.
<P>
Un accident nucléaire peut engendrer une énorme angoisse chez le public, et pose des questions brûlantes dans un grand nombre de domaines. Ceux-ci incluent la meilleure façon dagir pour les individus et leurs familles, les perspectives de maladies ou même de décès dans lavenir, le danger pour les enfants non-nés et sassurer que leau et les aliments locaux ne présentent aucun danger.
<P>
Dans la plupart des cas, la population se tournera dabord vers les autorités locales, auprès desquelles elle sattend à trouver une information fiable, des conseils adaptés et une aide appropriée.
<P>
Ce document décrit lampleur dun accident nucléaire potentiel, définit les conséquences probables pour la santé, indique quelles sont les actions possibles et donne les grandes lignes dun processus de planification durgence pour la santé publique.

<P>
Il n'y a de dose de plomb dans l'organisme qui soit inoffensive. Les collectivit s locales devraient donc prendre des mesures d'urgence pour pr venir les probl mes qui peuvent en r sulter pour la sant  humaine et l'environnement. Cela impliquera de mener des enqu tes sur la teneur du sang en plomb chez les jeunes enfants et, en fonction des r sutats, de proc der ensuite aux interventions n cessaires. Lorsque le taux de plomb dans le sang est sup rieur 15 microgrammes/dl, des mesures doivent  tre prises pour r duire l'exposition

A l'heure où trois quarts de la population européenne, et bientôt la moitié de la population mondiale vit en ville, les collectivités locales cherchent à mieux comprendre le processus d'évolution des villes et son influence sur la santé.
<P>
Le développement urbain est le résultat de la confrontation de la politique locale à des facteurs sur lesquels la collectivité n'a que peu d'influence , tels que la démographie, la mobilité des personnes et des biens, la santé publique, les rapports de force, les modèles théoriques  et l'identité culturelle de la ville. La collectivité peut en revanche jouer sur certains leviers qui lui permettent d'améliorer les conditions de vie en ville et la santé des citadins.<P>

L'histoire du développement urbain en Europe depuis la révolution industrielle montre que la santé est une préoccupation de plus en plus importante pour les différents acteurs qui font la ville.  Aujourd'hui on peut tirer les enseignements de cette histoire, pour mettre en place une action coordonnée  dans les différents champs d'intervention de la collectivité (environnement,  social, culture, économie) afin de donner à chacun les moyens de mener une vie pleinement satisfaisante, en jouissant d'une bonne santé.

<HR>

<H3><a name="contam">Les sols contaminés</A>
</H3>

Les autorités locales se retrouvent de plus en plus souvent confrontées au problème des sols contaminés, héritage dune période prenant sa source à la révolution industrielle, où lutilisation des sols à usage industriel nétait pas contrôlée.
<P>
Il est absolument essentiel pour la protection de la santé de la population de comprendre les effets de la contamination des sols, deffectuer une enquête et une évaluation des sites contaminés, et de connaître les options disponibles pour remédier ou gérer de tels sites.
<P>
Ce document donne un aperçu des problèmes. Il met le problème de contamination des sols au centre des préoccupations des autorités locales lorsquelles établissent leurs systèmes de planification dutilisation des sols, quelles exercent un contrôle sur les terrains "à risque" pour la santé, ou quelles sont propriétaires de terrains.

La plupart des activit s humaines engendrent des d chets. La majorit  de ceux-ci ne constituent pas en eux-m mes une menace pour la sant , mais la mani re de les  liminer peut pr senter des risques qu'il est possible de r duire ou de pr venir par une gestion appropri e.

Il n'y a pas une fa on "correcte" de collecter, de traiter et d' liminer les d chets, mais toute une s rie d'options. Celles-ci doivent  tre adapt es aux circonstances locales, telles que la quantit  et le type de d chets, la r gion et le climat, les conditions  conomiques.
<P>
Dans une premi re  tape importante, les autorit s locales doivent encourager la r duction de la quantit  et de la toxicit  des d chets. Une bonne gestion de ce qui reste permettra de prot ger l'environnement local et mondial. Cette brochure pr sente une vue d'ensemble de la gestion des d chets solides.

<HR>
<H3><a name="incin">Lincinération des déchets</A>
</H3>
Lincinération des déchets est une méthode hygiénique de réduire le volume et le poids de ces déchets, tout en réduisant son potentiel de pollution. Elle ne convient pas à tous les types de déchets. Les résidus du processus dincinération doivent encore être mis en décharge, ainsi que la partie non combustible des déchets: par conséquent, lincinération à elle seule ne peut pas fournir une solution au problème délimination des déchets.
<P>
La génération délectricité ou la production de vapeur ou deau chaude comme produit du processus dincinération présente le double avantage de remplacer lénergie générée par les combustibles fossiles finis et daméliorer le système économique de lincinération, qui est loption délimination des déchets la plus coûteuse.

<HR>
<H3><a name="collec">La collecte des déchets</A>
</H3>
Un syst me efficace et global de collecte des d chets est essentiel pour la protection de la sant . L'efficacit  de tout le plan de gestion des d chets d'une ville ou d'une r gion d pend du niveau de qualit  du service de collecte. Un syst me moderne et bien g r  de collecte et de transport des d chets non seulement prot ge la sant  de l'ensemble de la population, mais est en outre suffisamment s r et hygi nique pour tous ceux qui travaillent dans le cadre de ce syst me ou ont des activit s professionnelles qui y sont li es. Cela vaut pour les producteurs de d chets; le personnel qui assure la collecte, le transport et le traitement des d chets; les enfants et les personnes qui proc dent   la r cup ration des d chets; et,   une  chelle plus large, pour tous les habitants de la ville.
<P>
Les co ts de collecte peuvent repr senter la moiti , voire m me davantage, du total du budget de gestion des d chets. Par cons quent, une bonne gestion des d chets n'est pas seulement avantageuse sur les plans de l'environnement et de la sant , mais aussi du point de vue  conomique.
<HR>

<H3><a name="dechar">Les décharges</A>
</H3>
La mise en d charge est la m thode la plus ancienne et la plus largement pratiqu e pour l' limination des d chets solides. Les d charges construites et exploit es de fa on appropri e offrent un fa on tout   fait s re d' liminer les d chets solides urbains, g n ralement au co t le plus faible par rapport aux autres options d' limination. Il n'est pas n cessaire, pour des consid rations d'hygi ne et d'environnement, d'investir dans d'autres m thodes d' limination des d chets si l'on dispose de sites appropri s pour la cr ation de d charges. Par contre, les d p ts de d chets "sauvages", sans  gards pour l'environnement local, doivent  tre remplac s au plus vite par la mise en d charge contr l e ou d'autres m thodes de traitement et d' limination.<P>

La plupart des autres options de traitement et d' limination de d chets, telles que le recyclage et l'incin ration, impliquent de toute fa on le recours   la mise en d charge pour l' limination des d chets qui ne se pr tent pas au processus choisi, ainsi que des r sidus de ce dernier. Une capacit  de mise en d charge est donc indispensable dans chaque r gion et continuera d' tre n cessaire   l'avenir, quels que soient les progr s technologiques qui seraient accomplis.

<HR>

<H3><a name="mini">La minimisation des déchets</A>
</H3>
La minimisation des déchets permet déconomiser les ressources et contribue à la protection de lenvironnement. Ces mesures ne devraient pas être appliquées uniquement aux déchets solides tangibles résultant de la fabrication ou de lutilisation dun objet, mais sattaquer aussi à toutes les ressources consommées durant ce processus.
<P>
Bien que le recyclage des déchets puisse avoir un impact positif en réduisant la quantité de matériaux envoyée pour traitement ou élimination, le recyclage nest pas à proprement parler un processus de minimisation. En effet, la minimisation des déchets implique de réduire à son plus bas niveau le montant et la toxicité des déchets produits.
<P>
On peut parvenir à ce résultat en changeant les procédures de fabrication dans lindustrie, et en modifiant les habitudes du public. De plus, on peut retarder lapparition des déchets en créant des produits ayant une plus longue durée de vie et en offrant la possibilité de les réparer.

<H3><a name="desin">La désinfection de l'eau</A>
</H3>
On d&eacute;nombre chaque ann&eacute;e dans le monde 3 millions
de d&eacute;c&egrave;s directement li&eacute;s &agrave; la consommation
d'eau non potable. Un chiffre colossal et particuli&egrave;rement
inqui&eacute;tant &agrave; mettre en parall&egrave;le avec les
120 millions de personnes qui, dans la r&eacute;gion Europe de
l'OMS, ne disposent pas &agrave; ce jour et en permanence d'une
eau microbiologiquement potable.
<P>
Les autorit&eacute;s locales sont les premi&egrave;res concern&eacute;es
pour &eacute;liminer ce risque et faire face &agrave; des contaminations
qui, m&ecirc;me minimes, peuvent &ecirc;tre &agrave; l'origine
d'&eacute;pid&eacute;mies catastrophiques. Il leur appartient
de tout mettre en oeuvre pour offrir &agrave; la population une
eau saine, 24 h sur 24.
<P>
L'application de r&egrave;gles simples garantit l'obtention d'une
eau de qualit&eacute;. Parmi celles-ci, et avant d'envisager un
pr&eacute;traitement des eaux par des moyens hautement sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s
et souvent co&ucirc;teux, la d&eacute;sinfection de la ressource
par le chlore reste, dans tous les cas, une priorit&eacute;.


<H3><a name="capt">La protection des captages</A>
</H3>Les collectivit&eacute;s locales sont en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
responsables de la qualit&eacute; des eaux distribu&eacute;es
&agrave; la population. Elles doivent s'assurer que celles-ci
sont, en permanence, propres &agrave; cet usage.
<P>
Il est d'autant plus facile de fournir au public des eaux de qualit&eacute;
satisfaisante que l'on utilise des ressources dont on est s&ucirc;r
qu'elles sont, au d&eacute;part, exemptes de pollution. Une des
conditions pour maintenir la qualit&eacute; naturelle des eaux
est de mettre en oeuvre une politique active et volontariste de
protection des captages.
<P>
Les difficult&eacute;s rencontr&eacute;es lors de l'institution
des p&eacute;rim&egrave;tres de protection sont tr&egrave;s semblables
d'un pays &agrave; un autre : elles sont de nature technique,
administrative et financi&egrave;re. Le pr&eacute;sent document
a pour objectif de fournir des &eacute;l&eacute;ments pratiques
en vue de faciliter leur mise en place.

<H3><a name="eau">L'eau et la Santé</A>
</H3>

A l'aube du XXIème siècle et bien que de nombreux pays de la région Europe de l'O.M.S. figurent parmi les plus développés, la distribution d'eau pose encore des problèmes:
<ul>
<li>plus de 10 millions d'européens ne disposent pas d'un robinet d'eau, potable ou non, à l'intérieur de leur domicile;

<LI>une maladie qu'on croyait oubliée, le choléra, fait sa réapparition et provoque des épidémies majeures ;

<LI>des dizaines de millions de personnes sont alimentées par des eaux qui ne satisfont ni aux recommandations de l'O.M.S., ni aux normes nationales ou internationales.
</UL>
Les autorités locales assurent , dans la grande majorité des pays, la distribution d'eau potable.  Elles  ont à ce titre une lourde responsabilité en matière de Santé Publique.

Ce document a pour  buts :
<ul>
<LI>d'aider à mieux percevoir les relations entre l'eau et la santé ;
<LI>de faciliter l'établissement de priorités;
<LI>de montrer l'importance qu'il y a à garantir à la population - y compris aux plus démunis - une alimentation permanente en eau de qualité.
</ul>

Une série de brochures concises, techniquement erréprochables ont été rédigées par les meilleurs experts conseillés par des spécialistes en communication et en linguistique. Elles sont destinées à éclairer sur la nature des risques et informent sur les coûts des différentes options. Elles permettent de mettre au point des stratégies en matièere de danté et d'environnement. Elles aident à évaluer rapidement une situation sur un aspect donné de santé environnementale et constituent de ce fait un outil précieux d'aide à la décision.

<P>
Une centaine de titres, dont certains seront traduits en 20 langues, devraient être disponibles d'ici fin 1997.

<H4>Une préoccupation quotidienne pour les collectivités locales
</H4>


La qualité de l'air dans la ville, la mise à disposition d'une eau saine en quantité suffisante, la gestion des déchets, lan planification urbaine ... sont autant de défis auxquels est confronté le décideur local. L'information généralement disponible est disparate, parfois peu fiable, ou malheureussement illisible pour une personne qui n'est mas du sérail.

<P>
Et pourtant, les décisions doivent être prises. Ces brochures, directement utilisables par de nombreaux intervenants, deviendront un outil indispensable pour les décideurs locaux et leurs services techniques.<P>
L'ensemble des agences des Nations-Unies à Rio, puis plus specialement l?OMS lors de la Conférence d'Helsinki, ont reçu pour mandat d'être plus proche des collectivités locales dans le domaine de l'environnement et la santé. Ces brochures constituent un premier élément de réponse.

<hr>
Depuis sa parution (Juillet 1995), la
lettre d'information du Bureau de Projets a apport&eacute; r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement
quelques &eacute;l&eacute;ments sommaires sur les activit&eacute;s
d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es, dans le cadre d'un budget sp&eacute;cial,
en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine.
<P>
Compte tenu des &eacute;volutions r&eacute;centes
vers le r&eacute;tablissement de la paix, notamment par la signature
&agrave; Paris des accords pr&eacute;par&eacute;s &agrave; Dayton,
il a paru essentiel de consacrer ce quatri&egrave;me num&eacute;ro
&agrave; la Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine.
<P>
Le pass&eacute; relativement r&eacute;cent
a montr&eacute; que, dans des situations identiques, des financements
(multilat&eacute;raux, bilat&eacute;raux, caritatifs, priv&eacute;s...),
souvent importants, ont &eacute;t&eacute; propos&eacute;s, une
fois la paix revenue, pour la reconstruction des zones sinistr&eacute;es.
En l'absence de projets techniques pr&eacute;cis visant &agrave;
la r&eacute;habilitation des services publics essentiels, ces
budgets n'ont pas trouv&eacute; une utilisation rapide et ont
&eacute;t&eacute; fr&eacute;quemment r&eacute;orient&eacute;s
vers d'autres objectifs et d'autres lieux. Une &eacute;volution
semblable pouvait &ecirc;tre v&eacute;cue en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine.
<P>
Le Bureau de Projets a propos&eacute;
de proc&eacute;der, pendant la <B>p&eacute;riode des hostilit&eacute;s</B>
et en <B>&eacute;troite collaboration </B>avec les instances internationales
et bilat&eacute;rales pr&eacute;sentes sur le terrain ainsi qu'avec
les autorit&eacute;s politiques et les responsables techniques
des villes Bosniaques concern&eacute;es, &agrave; l'identification
de<B> projets techniques</B> pr&eacute;sentant un caract&egrave;re
prioritaire &eacute;vident pour apporter des conditions de vie
acceptables aux populations de ces centres urbains (r&eacute;sidents,
r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s, personnes d&eacute;plac&eacute;es).
<P>
Cette proposition a &eacute;t&eacute;
accept&eacute;e et a re&ccedil;u l'appui financier du Bureau R&eacute;gional
de l'OMS pour l'Europe (105 000 $ US sur deux ans). Les activit&eacute;s
ont pu d&eacute;buter d&egrave;s la fin 1993, par une mission
de reconnaissance et de faisabilit&eacute;, se sont poursuivies
par l'affectation d'<B>ing&eacute;nieurs de sant&eacute; publique
en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine</B> depuis le premier trimestre de
l'ann&eacute;e 1994.
<P>
Ce quatri&egrave;me num&eacute;ro de
la lettre du Bureau de Projets de l'OMS pr&eacute;sente, d'une
part, une synth&egrave;se des actions men&eacute;es depuis un
peu plus de deux ans et, d'autre part, une esquisse des perspectives
attendues pour la reconstruction de la Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine
et le r&ocirc;le que le Bureau de Projets pourrait y avoir.
<H2>Les activit&eacute;s du Bureau de Projets </H2>


Sch&eacute;matiquement, elles sont de trois types:
<OL>
<LI>Identification de projets locaux
de reconstruction des services publics,
<LI>Surveillance de la qualit&eacute;
des eaux distribu&eacute;es,
<LI>Programmation et r&eacute;alisation
des projets de r&eacute;habilitation.
</OL>

<H2>Identification de projets de reconstruction des services publics
</H2>


Cette partie du programme
a eu pour objectif de pr&eacute;parer la transition entre les
activit&eacute;s &agrave; court terme d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es
par les organisations humanitaires d'urgence et le travail, &agrave;
plus long terme, de reconstruction qui sera assur&eacute; par
les organismes de coop&eacute;ration bilat&eacute;rale, les agences
de d&eacute;veloppement et les organisations de financement. Les
premi&egrave;res r&eacute;unions de potentiels bailleurs de fonds
ont officiellement d&eacute;but&eacute; fin d&eacute;cembre 1995
et se poursuivent &agrave; rythme r&eacute;gulier.
<P>
Le Bureau de Projets a
collabor&eacute; avec le personnel municipal de chaque localit&eacute;
visit&eacute;e bien avant la fin des hostilit&eacute;s et identifi&eacute;
plusieurs projets prioritaires dans les domaines de l'<B>ing&eacute;nierie
de sant&eacute; publique</B>, li&eacute;s aux objectifs g&eacute;n&eacute;raux
du Bureau:
<UL>
<LI>syst&egrave;mes de
distribution d'<B>eau potable</B>,
<LI>syst&egrave;mes d'&eacute;vacuation
et traitement des <B>eaux us&eacute;es</B>,
<LI>gestion des <B>d&eacute;chets
solides</B>, et
<LI>r&eacute;habilitation
du <B>g&eacute;nie civil</B> d'&eacute;tablissements <B>hospitalier</B>s.

</UL>


Les <B>crit&egrave;res
de priorit&eacute;</B> appliqu&eacute;s par les ing&eacute;nieurs
sont les suivants:
<UL>
<LI>situation de &#171;&nbsp;vie
ou mort&nbsp;&#187;
<LI>r&eacute;duction des
probl&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; publique touchant une fraction
importante de la population, ou certains groupes vuln&eacute;rables
<LI>pr&eacute;vention
de probl&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; publique importants
<LI>extension des infrastructures
aux zones nouvellement occup&eacute;es et dont il semble que la
population y restera
<LI>meilleurs fonctionnement
et gestion des services
</UL>


Chaque ville &#171;&nbsp;prospect&eacute;e&nbsp;&#187;
a fait l'objet d'un &#171;<B>&nbsp;rapport de ville</B>&nbsp;&#187;
&eacute;tabli selon un mod&egrave;le standardis&eacute;:

les activit&eacute;s ont int&eacute;gr&eacute; &eacute;galement
les secteurs prot&eacute;g&eacute;s par les Nations Unies en Croatie;
par contre, les villes de Sarajevo et de Mostar, &#171;&nbsp;couvertes&nbsp;&#187;
par d'autres structures n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; prises en
compte par le Bureau de Projets ) ont

projets ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tudi&eacute;s: <B>49</B>
dans le domaine de l' <B>eau potable</B>, <B>12</B> pour l'&eacute;vacuation
et le traitement des <B>eaux</B> <B>us&eacute;es</B>, <B>12</B>
pour les <B>d&eacute;chets</B> <B>solides</B> et <B>4</B> pour
le <B>g&eacute;nie civil hospitalier</B>. Leur co&ucirc;t s'&eacute;chelonne
de 20 000 &agrave; 5 millions de $ US, pour un montant global
de <B>79 millions de $</B>.
<P>
 Ces projets r&eacute;pondent
pour 5 % d'entre eux au premier crit&egrave;re retenu (cf. page
pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente), 16 % au deuxi&egrave;me, 39 % au troisi&egrave;me
et 11 % au quatri&egrave;me crit&egrave;re.
<P>
 L' OMS a fait conna&icirc;tre
ces projets d'agences de d&eacute;veloppement et de donateurs
potentiels. Cette m&eacute;thode devrait permettre de lancer la
r&eacute;habilitation le plus rapidement possible apr&egrave;s
la fin de la guerre. Ce travail a fourni une base sur laquelle
d'autres agences oeuvrant en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine, ou au
plan international, ont pu envisager leurs programmes de financement
n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; la r&eacute;habilitation.
<P>
 Pour sa part, un <B>groupe
de travail</B> r&eacute;uni fin janvier 1996 par la <B>Banque
Mondiale</B> a estim&eacute;, pour le seul &#171;&nbsp;secteur
<B>eaux</B>&nbsp;&#187;, &agrave; <B>70 millions de $</B> le co&ucirc;t
des projets &agrave; r&eacute;aliser pendant la premi&egrave;re
ann&eacute;e de reconstruction de la Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine.

<H2>Surveillance de la qualit&eacute; des eaux distribu&eacute;es
</H2>


 Au cours de l'ann&eacute;e
1995, plusieurs changements sont intervenus dans l'&eacute;volution
du conflit et le Bureau de Projets a chang&eacute; ses orientations
et s'est consacr&eacute;e &agrave; l'approvisionnement des villes
de Bosnie Centrale en eau, avec pour objectif de garantir une
qualit&eacute; minimale malgr&eacute; l'absence totale de laboratoire.
Deux &#171;&nbsp;trousses&nbsp;&#187; de terrain ont &eacute;t&eacute;
mises au point, la premi&egrave;re se rapportant aux caract&eacute;ristiques
physico-chimiques et la seconde &agrave; l'analyse microbiologique.

<P>
<B> 15 </B>
trousses de premi&egrave;re type aux services des villes de   Bugojno,
Busovaca, Gorni Vakuf, Kakanj, Kiseljac, Kresevo, Maglaj, Novi
Travnik, Travnik, Tesanj, Vitez, Visoko, Zavidovici, Zepce.

<P>
<B> 9 </B>
trousses du second type ainsi que 9 st&eacute;rilisateurs portatifs
ont &eacute;t&eacute; distribu&eacute;es aux Instituts R&eacute;gionaux
de Sant&eacute; Publique de   Bugojno,
Kakanj, Zavidovici, Kladanj, Zivinice, Srebrenik, Tuzla, Zenica,
Novi Travnik.
<P>
 D  e
plus, l'UNICEF a dot&eacute; 12 camps de r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s
de 2 trousses du deuxi&egrave;me type.
<P>
 Les techniciens charg&eacute;s
de ces &eacute;quipements ont &eacute;t&eacute; form&eacute;s.
<P>
 Ces &eacute;quipements
de &#171;&nbsp;fortune&nbsp;&#187; ont &eacute;t&eacute; une contribution
majeure &agrave; la qualit&eacute; des eaux distribu&eacute;es
et &agrave; la protection g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la sant&eacute;
publique des populations concern&eacute;es.
<P>
 Un programme r&eacute;gulier
a pu ainsi &ecirc;tre lanc&eacute;. Ses r&eacute;sultats ont &eacute;t&eacute;,
et continueront &agrave; &ecirc;tre, utilis&eacute;s pour l'identification
de petites interventions techniques &agrave; r&eacute;aliser par
les ONG ou les services municipaux. Ils ont aussi contribu&eacute;
&agrave; l'&eacute;tablissement ou &agrave; la r&eacute;vision
de priorit&eacute;s parmi les projets du programme de reconstruction.
Enfin, une base de donn&eacute;es sur la qualit&eacute; des eaux
de distribution a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;e.
<H2>Programmation et r&eacute;alisation des projets de r&eacute;habilitation
</H2>


 La signature de l'accord
de paix a ouvert la perspective d'une paix durable dans la r&eacute;gion
toute enti&egrave;re. L'&eacute;lan est donn&eacute; &agrave;
un programme de reconstruction, et toutes les parties prenantes
dans le conflit attendent, d'organismes tels que les Nations Unies,
la Banque Mondiale, l'Union Europ&eacute;enne, les coop&eacute;rations
bilat&eacute;rales et d'autres, des promesses de dons et d'emprunts
&agrave; long terme pour la reconstruction.

<P>
 Les activit&eacute;s d'<B>ing&eacute;nierie
de sant&eacute; publique</B> men&eacute;es par le Bureau de Projets
devraient continuer dans deux domaines:
<P>
 i) assistance strat&eacute;gique
aux autorit&eacute;s gouvernementales Bosniaques; et
<BR>
 ii) poursuite de l'assistance
au niveau local.

<P>
 Un objectif strat&eacute;gique
clair est retenu: poursuivre sur le terrain le travail de r&eacute;habilitation.


<P>
 L'ing&eacute;nieur responsable
de l'&eacute;quipe, maintenant bas&eacute;e &agrave; Sarajevo
o&ugrave; la pr&eacute;sence de l'OMS s'est &eacute;toff&eacute;e,
est impliqu&eacute; dans les activit&eacute;s de <B>planification</B>
et de <B>coordination</B> suivantes:

<ol>
<li>D&eacute;velopper et
participer &agrave; une <B>&eacute;quipe conjointe</B> comprenant
des repr&eacute;sentants techniques du gouvernement de Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine,
charg&eacute;e de pr&eacute;parer les informations n&eacute;cessaires
&agrave; la mise en oeuvre des projets de reconstruction. Le r&ocirc;le
de l'&eacute;quipe consiste &agrave; assurer la jonction entre
des projets d'ing&eacute;nierie de sant&eacute; publique clairement
d&eacute;finis, les pouvoirs nationaux, et les budgets allou&eacute;s
par les bailleurs bilat&eacute;raux et la Banque Mondiale.


<li>Accro&icirc;tre la
port&eacute;e du programme d'ing&eacute;nierie de sant&eacute;
publique en identifiant de <B>nouveaux projets prioritaires</B>
dans des villes du <B>nord</B> et de l'<B>est</B> de la Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine
et en pr&eacute;parant de nouveaux &quot; Rapports de ville&quot;.



<li>D&eacute;finir et justifier
les caract&eacute;ristiques techniques d'une &#171;&nbsp;trousse
OMS N&#176;3&nbsp;&#187; destin&eacute;e au r&eacute;&eacute;quipement
de laboratoires r&eacute;gionaux de sant&eacute; publique et d'analyse
des eaux, qui pourraient &ecirc;tre int&eacute;gr&eacute;s aux
Instituts R&eacute;gionaux de Sant&eacute; Publique.


<li>Int&eacute;grer les
&#171;&nbsp;trousses No 2&nbsp;&#187; distribu&eacute;es par l'UNICEF
(20 au total) dans les r&eacute;gions de Mostar, Bihac et Banja
Luka au programme OMS d'analyse de la qualit&eacute; des eaux,
et assurer une collaboration et une liaison r&eacute;guli&egrave;res
avec l'UNICEF pour l'utilisation des r&eacute;sultats d'analyses
et le r&eacute;approvisionnement en consommables. Pr&eacute;parer
un transfert d&eacute;finitif des responsabilit&eacute;s en mati&egrave;re
d'analyse de la qualit&eacute; des eaux aux institutions locales,
une fois qu'elles auront &eacute;t&eacute; remises sur pied et
r&eacute;&eacute;quip&eacute;es.
</ol>

 Le Bureau de Projets a
particip&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;union des donateurs, organis&eacute;e
les 12 et 13 Avril 1996 &agrave; Bruxelles par la Banque Mondiale
et l'Union Europ&eacute;enne: il a pu ainsi pr&eacute;senter ses
activit&eacute;s aux diff&eacute;rentes d&eacute;l&eacute;gations
pr&eacute;sentes.

<P>
 Enfin, il a &eacute;galement
pris part &agrave; la mission organis&eacute;e, du 18 au 20 avril,
par &#171;&nbsp;Cit&eacute;s Unies France&nbsp;&#187; en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine,
&agrave; l'intention d'une d&eacute;l&eacute;gation de maires
fran&ccedil;ais.

<P>
 En conclusion, les axes
d'activit&eacute;s pour les court, moyen et long termes sont au
nombre de quatre: des investissements importants pour la reconstruction
des infrastructures (financements internationaux et/ou bilat&eacute;raux),
poursuites du programme de surveillance de la qualit&eacute; des
eaux distribu&eacute;es, &eacute;changes d'exp&eacute;rience par
mise &agrave; disposition et accueil d'ing&eacute;nieurs et techniciens,
dons de camions-bennes aux villes bosniaques pour l'enl&egrave;vement
des d&eacute;chets solides et des gravats - il sera trait&eacute;
de cette derni&egrave;re action dans un prochain num&eacute;ro
de la lettre d'information.

<H2>La Lettre d' Information du Bureau de Projets O.M.S.
</H2>
<H2>Juillet 1996 n&#176; 5</H2>

<H1>Centre Européen<BR>
de l'environnement et de la santé</H1>


</center>


Depuis sa cr&eacute;ation (Juillet 1995), la
lettre d'information du Bureau de Projets a apport&eacute; r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement
des &eacute;l&eacute;ments d'information relatifs soit &agrave;
des activit&eacute;s d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es dans le cadre de
projets sp&eacute;cifiques soit &agrave; un Etat-membre pr&eacute;cis
o&ugrave; des projets sont en cours de r&eacute;alisation.
<P>
C'est ainsi que les deux premiers num&eacute;ros
(Juillet et Octobre 1995) ont fourni des informations relatives
&agrave; diff&eacute;rents projets r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans
la zone g&eacute;ographique du Bureau de Projets, les PECO, alors
que les deux suivants (Janvier et Avril 1996) ont trait&eacute;
sp&eacute;cialement de projets mis en oeuvre au Turkm&eacute;nistan
(en collaboration avec le PNUD-Ashgabat qui a apport&eacute; son
appui financier &agrave; hauteur de 485 000 US $) et en Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine
(avec un budget particulier mis &agrave; disposition par le Bureau
R&eacute;gional de l'O.M.S. pour l'Europe).
<P>
Ce <B>cinqui&egrave;me num&eacute;ro</B> reprend
la ligne des deux premiers (informations sur quelques projets)
mais au pr&eacute;alable quelques &#171;&nbsp;nouvelles&nbsp;&#187;
du Turkm&eacute;nistan et de la Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine.
<P>
S'agissant du <B>Turkm&eacute;nistan</B>, les
activit&eacute;s &eacute;voluent positivement:
<UL>
<li>pour ce qui est du projet &#171;&nbsp;d&eacute;chets
solides&nbsp;&#187;: 15 tonnes de pi&egrave;ces d&eacute;tach&eacute;es
ont permis la remise en &eacute;tat progressive de la flotte de
camions-bennes, une &eacute;tude de la composition des d&eacute;chets
domestiques est en cours de r&eacute;alisation et une formation
a &eacute;t&eacute; dispens&eacute;e aux responsables techniques
de la ville d'Ashgabat. L'&eacute;tude pr&eacute;alable &agrave;
la r&eacute;vision des circuits de collecte d&eacute;butera &agrave;
l'automne.
<LI>le projet-pilote &#171;&nbsp;alimentation
en eau&nbsp;&#187; a permis d'&eacute;quiper (surpresseur individuel,
compteur d'immeuble, b&acirc;che de r&eacute;serve, r&eacute;parations
des fuites int&eacute;rieures - canalisations et chasses - d&eacute;signation
d'un responsable par immeuble et mise &agrave; disposition de
num&eacute;ros de t&eacute;l&eacute;phone &agrave; appeler en
cas d'incidents...)  quelques immeubles &agrave; la grande satisfaction
de leurs r&eacute;sidants qui disposent maintenant d'un service
continu. La consommation journali&egrave;re a, dans ces immeubles,
&eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;duite d'environ 30% m&ecirc;me si elle
reste encore &eacute;lev&eacute;e. La sensibilisation des r&eacute;sidents
&agrave; ce probl&egrave;me continue alors qu'une campagne plus
ambitieuse a &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;e par voie de m&eacute;dia
(t&eacute;l&eacute;vision, radio, journaux), bas&eacute;e sur
le th&egrave;me de l'&eacute;conomie de l'eau (&#171;&nbsp;une
goutte d'eau est une goutte d'or&nbsp;&#187;).
</UL>

Le programme du PNUD pour la p&eacute;riode
1997-1999 sera arr&ecirc;t&eacute; courant d&eacute;cembre 1996:
 le Bureau de Projets et le PNUD-Ashgabat pr&eacute;pareront,
courant novembre prochain, de nouveaux documents de projets pour
assurer la poursuite des activit&eacute;s men&eacute;es en commun.
<P>
Pour la <B>Bosnie-Herz&eacute;govine</B>, des
actions de sensibilisation aux projets identifi&eacute;s par le
Bureau ont &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;es &agrave; la suite de
la derni&egrave;re r&eacute;union des donateurs. Un premier r&eacute;sultat
positif vient d'&ecirc;tre obtenu: le Bureau de Projets a re&ccedil;u
d'un &Eacute;tat-membre un budget de 30 000 US $, qui permettra
l'affectation, pendant cinq &agrave; six mois, d'un ing&eacute;nieur
sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; dans la gestion des d&eacute;chets solides
qui travaillera successivement dans deux ou trois villes pour
contribuer &agrave; l'&eacute;vacuation des d&eacute;chets et
gravats qui s'y sont accumul&eacute;s pendant de longs mois et
&agrave; la reprise des services concern&eacute;s de ces villes.
<P>
<CENTER>La lettre d'information du Bureau de
Projets sera prochainement disponible sur<B> Internet</B>; chaque
num&eacute;ro y sera accessible pendant six mois &agrave; l'adresse
suivante:      http://www.who.dk/tech/eh/newslet<B>X</B>.htm </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><o&ugrave; <B>X </B>correspond au num&eacute;ro
de la lettre d'information (le quatri&egrave;me num&eacute;ro
inaugure cette nouvelle forme de communication).</CENTER>
<H2>Un manuel de formation sur les d&eacute;chets miniers: &#171;
Les mines abandonn&eacute;es et la protection de la sant&eacute;
environnementale: une valise p&eacute;dagogique &#187; et un chapitre
sp&eacute;cial consacr&eacute; &agrave; l'hygi&egrave;ne du travail
</H2>
Ce mat&eacute;riel p&eacute;dagogique est le
r&eacute;sultat d'une coop&eacute;ration entre le Bureau de Projets
et le PNUE-Paris. Lanc&eacute;e il y a trois ans, cette collaboration
avait pour objectif de produire un manuel de formation &agrave;
la s&eacute;curit&eacute; de la population et &agrave; la protection
de l'environnement contre les effets des d&eacute;chets miniers.
<P>
Con&ccedil;u comme un guide pratique, ce manuel
apporte des donn&eacute;es, provenant d'exp&eacute;riences r&eacute;elles,
n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; la conception et aux m&eacute;thodes
de r&eacute;habilitation d'anciens sites miniers et de d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts
de d&eacute;chets miniers.
<P>
Les technologies pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es r&eacute;sultent
de recherches sur la pratique de la r&eacute;habilitation, men&eacute;e
par des chercheurs, des ing&eacute;nieurs et des techniciens des
secteurs priv&eacute; comme public de divers pays, y compris du
Canada.
<P>
Les conseils apport&eacute;s sont illustr&eacute;s
par des exercices, bas&eacute;s sur des cas r&eacute;els. Le manuel
est &agrave; la fois un ouvrage de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence et
une valise p&eacute;dagogique destin&eacute;e aux formateurs.
Des op&eacute;rations, mises en oeuvre par le pass&eacute;, permettent
le d&eacute;veloppement d'&eacute;tudes de cas et d'exercices.
Ils sont implant&eacute;s dans un pays imaginaire &#171;&nbsp;Udanax&nbsp;&#187;:
ils sont &eacute;tudi&eacute;s compl&egrave;tement sans que des
pays ou soci&eacute;t&eacute;s soient montr&eacute;es du doigt
pour d'&eacute;ventuelles erreurs commises.
<P>
Les mod&egrave;les de transparents, les exercices
et la structure &#171;&nbsp;pas &agrave; pas &#187; adopt&eacute;e
pour le manuel en font un ouvrage complet de formation des ing&eacute;nieurs
et techniciens d'op&eacute;rations. Il informera &eacute;galement
les gestionnaires et inspecteurs d'installations au sujet des
probl&egrave;mes et options essentiels des actions de r&eacute;habilitation.

<P>
Les principes essentiels de la r&eacute;habilitation,
de l'&eacute;vacuation des d&eacute;chets miniers et de la stabilisation
des barrages sont r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, en insistant particuli&egrave;rement
sur les aspects protection de la sant&eacute; et de l'environnement.
Des r&eacute;f&eacute;rences et une bibliographie importantes
viennent compl&eacute;ter le manuel et fournissent des possibilit&eacute;s
de formation plus approfondie. M&ecirc;me s'il contient une vaste
information scientifique et technique, ce manuel ne doit pas &ecirc;tre
consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un ouvrage de base et n'a pas la
pr&eacute;tention d'&ecirc;tre un manuel de conception. Au contraire,
des r&eacute;f&eacute;rences bibliographiques particuli&egrave;res
permettront aux lecteurs de passer des principes aux d&eacute;tails
d'applications particuli&egrave;res. Les directeurs et les gestionnaires
y trouveront des listes de contr&ocirc;le et des tableaux de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence,
utiles lors de l'engagement d'ing&eacute;nieurs-conseils et d'entreprises,
et de la v&eacute;rification de leurs rapports.
<P>
Les effets des d&eacute;chets miniers sur la
sant&eacute; ont &eacute;t&eacute; pris en consid&eacute;ration
dans un chapitre sp&eacute;cial intitul&eacute; &#171;&nbsp;L'hygi&egrave;ne
du travail li&eacute;e aux activit&eacute;s mini&egrave;res&nbsp;&#187;,
contribution revenant tout naturellement au Bureau de Projets.
Les probl&egrave;mes de l'hygi&egrave;ne du travail y ont &eacute;t&eacute;
examin&eacute;s sous deux angles compl&eacute;mentaires: les impacts
physiques et les effets chimiques.
<P>
Les impacts physiques englobent le bruit et
les vibrations, les temp&eacute;ratures extr&ecirc;mes, les poussi&egrave;res
et particules, et la pression atmosph&eacute;rique. Les effets
chimiques ont mis l'accent sur des sujets particuliers comme les
gaz, les cyanures, l'ingestion et l'inhalation de m&eacute;taux
lourds. L'impact biologique probable sur la sant&eacute; des mineurs
a aussi &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tudi&eacute;.
<P>
L'utilisation d'&eacute;quipements bruyants
et d'outils vibrants peut entra&icirc;ner respectivement surdit&eacute;
ou syndrome de la &#171;&nbsp;main morte&nbsp;&#187;. Ces deux
effets ne sont que des exemples, parmi les plus connus, des risques
encourus par les mineurs et leur sant&eacute;.
<P>
Le chapitre sur l'hygi&egrave;ne du travail
dans les mines d&eacute;crit aussi les &#171;&nbsp;m&eacute;thodes
de r&eacute;duction des risques&nbsp;&#187; et certaines possibilit&eacute;s
techniques de mise en oeuvre.
<P>
Des passages du manuel ont &eacute;t&eacute;
test&eacute;s au Zimbabwe et au P&eacute;rou: les conclusions
ont montr&eacute; que c'est un outil id&eacute;al pour les programmes
de formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des op&eacute;rateurs miniers.
<H2>L'eau et l'assainissement dans quatre villes d' Arm&eacute;nie:
Er&eacute;van, Gumri, Vanadzor et Spitak</H2>
Le Bureau de Projets, associ&eacute; &agrave;
la Banque Mondiale, a r&eacute;cemment &eacute;valu&eacute; les
priorit&eacute;s d'investissement dans les domaines de l'eau et
de l'assainissement dans les quatre villes principales d'Arm&eacute;nie
- Erevan, Gumri, Vanadzor et Spitak - qui regroupent environ 60%
de la population arm&eacute;nienne.
<P>
Les probl&egrave;mes de sant&eacute;
li&eacute;s &agrave; l'eau ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;valu&eacute;s
&agrave; partir des donn&eacute;es disponibles dans ces villes.
L'&eacute;valuation, qui a pris &eacute;galement en compte ressources
en eau, demande en eau, qualit&eacute; et disponibilit&eacute;
de l'eau distribu&eacute;e, eaux r&eacute;siduaires, situation
&eacute;conomique, a conduit &agrave; la d&eacute;finition d'investissements
prioritaires (r&eacute;habilitation et d&eacute;veloppement d'infrastructures).
<P>
Par ailleurs, un d&eacute;veloppement
l&eacute;gislatif tr&egrave;s important de d&eacute;centralisation
semble en cours; il pourrait accro&icirc;tre les responsabilit&eacute;s
des pouvoirs locaux dans la gestion des services d'eau, pour ce
qui concerne par exemple:
<UL>
<LI>la protection des ressources
(lutte contre la pollution de ressources de bonne qualit&eacute;),
<LI>la ma&icirc;trise des d&eacute;cisions
(infrastructures, fonctionnement, maintenance, r&eacute;duction
des fuites, recouvrement des co&ucirc;ts).
</UL>

<P>
La qualit&eacute; de la ressource
(torrents) utilis&eacute;e pour l'alimentation en eau des populations
est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement bonne. Par contre, des syst&egrave;mes
de distribution inad&eacute;quats, associ&eacute;s &agrave; des
p&eacute;nuries d'&eacute;nergie (blocus &eacute;conomique), entra&icirc;nent
une discontinuit&eacute; grave du service chez le consommateur
(importantes pertes dans les r&eacute;seaux).
<P>
 De nouveaux captages et de nouvelles
stations de traitement n&eacute;cessiteraient des investissements
lourds, et induiraient des co&ucirc;ts de fonctionnement et d'entretien
inacceptables.
<P>
 Une autre orientation technique
consisterait &agrave; concevoir les syst&egrave;mes diff&eacute;remment;
par exemple:
<UL>
<LI> certains r&eacute;seaux pourraient
&ecirc;tre gravitaires (g&eacute;ographie des sites), r&eacute;duisant
ainsi les besoins en &eacute;nergie et les co&ucirc;ts de fonctionnement
(50% du co&ucirc;t de l'eau r&eacute;sulte de l'&eacute;nergie
de pompage),
<LI> une meilleure &eacute;tanch&eacute;it&eacute;
des r&eacute;seaux am&eacute;liorerait la qualit&eacute; de l'eau
en pr&eacute;venant la contamination par des eaux pollu&eacute;es.
Si les fonds sont disponibles, l'interconnexion du r&eacute;seau
et sa mise en gravitaire am&eacute;lioreraient l'approvisionnement
des p&eacute;riph&eacute;ries urbaines.
<LI> l'installation de compteurs,
d'immeuble dans un premier temps, et la mise en oeuvre d'une tarification
r&eacute;aliste pourraient r&eacute;duire la demande (abus et
gaspillages). Cette disposition sensibiliserait la population,
fixerait les responsabilit&eacute;s, et faciliterait la gestion.
La d&eacute;signation de responsables d'immeuble pourrait &ecirc;tre
encourag&eacute;e.

<P>
 Dans cette optique, les villes
de Vanadzor, Spitak et certains quartiers de Erevan sont les priorit&eacute;s
premi&egrave;res. Des &eacute;tudes de faisabilit&eacute; et de
pr&eacute;-investissement devront pr&eacute;ciser la localisation
exacte des infrastructures &agrave; am&eacute;liorer (d&eacute;finition
de zones prioritaires comme projets pilotes). Les &eacute;tudes
d&eacute;j&agrave; r&eacute;alis&eacute;es (&agrave; Vanadzor
par  exemple) pourraient &ecirc;tre le point de d&eacute;part
d'investigations plus approfondies.
<P>
 L'am&eacute;lioration et/ou l'ach&egrave;vement
des syst&egrave;mes de collecte et traitement des eaux us&eacute;es
devront &ecirc;tre r&eacute;examin&eacute;s m&ecirc;me si les
rejets ne semblent pas pr&eacute;senter de risque pour la population
en aval. Le risque pourrait venir par contre d'une mauvaise collecte
des eaux us&eacute;es. Pour autant, une r&eacute;habilitation
globale des r&eacute;seaux d'&eacute;gouts n'est actuellement
pas raisonnable.
<P>
 D'un point de vue l&eacute;gislatif,
les normes devraient &ecirc;tre r&eacute;vis&eacute;es pour &ecirc;tre
plus r&eacute;alistes.
<P>
 Les besoins de formation concernent
le diagnostic des r&eacute;seaux et les techniques de r&eacute;habilitation,
le contr&ocirc;le de la qualit&eacute; de l'eau distribu&eacute;e
(situation normale et situations d'urgence) et la ma&icirc;trise
de la demande en eau.

<H1><a name="P01">WHO Scientific Consultation on Human and Animal Spongiform
Encephalopathies</A></H1>


A scientific consultation of experts in the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs) from 14 countries met at the headquarters
of the World Health Organization (WHO), in Geneva, from 14 to
16 May 1996. The consultation examined in detail the clinical,
neurological and neuropathological findings associated with the
newly recognized variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), compared
these findings with data on other human TSEs, and further examined
their relationship to the animal TSEs including bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). In addition, the consultation evaluated
the need for worldwide surveillance of CJD, and reviewed TSE research
to date, including research on diagnostic tests, in order to identify
areas where further research is required.
<P>
After a thorough review of the characteristics of other naturally
occurring and experimental TSEs, the consultation concluded that
the clinical and neuropathological features of the newly recognized
CJD variant do not provide information which could be used to
prove the possible link between this disease and BSE in cattle.
The experts agreed that such a link can only be proven by continued
research to fully characterize the agent causing the disease in
humans so that it can be compared to other TSEs, including BSE,
and by further epidemiological research to establish the risk
factors for human infection. The experts emphasized that, because
naturally occurring TSEs have long incubation periods, epidemiological
studies would be longer than those for many other diseases.

<P>
Based on the recommendations of the consultation, WHO will coordinate
an intensified worldwide system for CJD surveillance and ensure
training in clinical and neuropathological diagnosis on CJD and
the other human TSEs at selected collaborating centres throughout
the world. In collaboration with the International Office of Epizooties
(OIE), WHO will likewise ensure worldwide surveillance for the
animal TSEs. Underlying these activities, WHO will continue to
provide a scientific forum for exchange on research issues related
to the TSEs as well as stimulate and facilitate research.






<H1><a name="P02">New variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (V-CJD), France</A></H1>


The reported occurrence in the United Kingdom of a new variant
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (V-CJD) has led to the re-examination
of cases identified in France in latter years. In 1992-1994, in
addition to cases observed in patients formerly treated by growth
hormone extracts, 135 cases were identified (about 0.8 cases per
million population per year). Of the 5 cases concerning younger
subjects, 2 were genetically determined and 1 was subsequent to
a human dura mater graft; no iatrogenic or genetic risk factor
could be identified in 2 cases:
<UL>
<LI>a 37-year-old male, for whom no specific investigation results
are available;
<LI>a 26-year-old male, who died recently in Lyon and in whom
histopathological observations are similar to those reported from
the United Kingdom. This case is still under investigation and
no new conclusions can be drawn at present.
</UL>


The protective mechanisms set up in France since 1990 are regularly
assessed and relevant WHO recommendations are rigorously applied.
CJD has been included among the compulsorily notifiable diseases;
the creation of an expert committee at the health ministry and
the clinical and neuropathological reassessment of cases observed
in recent years will assist in identifying new or hitherto unsuspected
elements concerning this rare disease.

<H1><a name="P03">Poliomyelitis in Europe: no cases in first quarter 1996 </A></H1>

<H2>The situation</H2>


As of 12 June, no cases of poliomyelitis have been reported from
the WHO European Region in the first quarter of 1996. This is
indeed a unique development in the history of poliomyelitis in
Europe. It brings strong hopes for achieving the goal of interrupting
transmission of wild polio viruses in Europe by 1997, preceding
the certification of poliomyelitis eradication in Europe by the
year 2000.
<P>
The three months' absence of reported poliomyelitis cases in Europe
is yet another indicator of the remarkable success of Operation
MECACAR, the campaign to eradicate poliomyelitis in the Mediterranean
and Caucasian regions and the central Asian Republics. During
1995, almost 60 million children under 5 years of age received
two doses of OPV (live attenuated polio virus vaccine) in 18 countries
of the Eastern Mediterranean and the European regions of WHO.
This resulted in a sharp decrease in poliomyelitis cases in the
participating European countries. As previously reported, in June
to December 1995, following the Operation, the number of cases
was only 17, in contrast to 159 cases reported during the same
period in 1994. Only in Turkey did MECACAR appear to have less
impact on the poliomyelitis incidence level, but this may only
reflect the improved (yet still not satisfactory) level of surveillance
of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) achieved as a result of the Operation.
The number of reported AFP cases in Turkey rose from 52 in 1993
and 63 in 1994 to 110 in 1995.
<H2>Poliomyelitis eradication activities in the Russian Federation,
1996</H2>


The Russian Federation is the key country in poliomyelitis eradication
activities during 1996. As reported in <I>CD News</I> No. 11,
the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation has taken significant
steps to achieve the target of polio eradication in coordination
with Operation MECACAR. In November 1995, the last case of the
outbreak of 146 cases of poliomyelitis in Chechnya starting January
1995 was reported. Actions to initiate AFP surveillance were undertaken
during 1995 and a new reporting system has been operational since
January 1996. So far, 66 cases of AFP were reported to the Ministry
of Health (the rate per 100,000 children under 15 is 0.86).
<P>
The Ministry of Health and the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological
Surveillance (SANEPID) developed good cooperation in preparing
for the National Immunization Day (NID). Three national workshops
were organized to brief, motivate and train health staff at <I>oblast</I>
level in Tula (for the European part of the country), Krasnoyarsk
(for Siberia and the Far East) and Essentuki (for the Caucasian
region). The NID target group was 3.8 million children under 3
years of age. OPV for this action was provided by the Ministry
of Health. The Ministry of Health, SANEPID and the Academy of
Medical Sciences jointly prepared a special appeal to all citizens
to support work for poliomyelitis eradication in the Russian Federation.

<P>
WHO closely monitored the preparation process for NID, providing
training and expertise. An international team of representatives
from WHO and Rotary International visited the country at the end
of January. Special attention was paid to gaining high-level political
commitment for the activity. WHO headquarters and the Regional
Office for Europe jointly issued a letter to the Prime Minister
of the Russian Federation. The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and Basic Support for Institutionalizing Child
Survival (BASICS) helped to plan social mobilization and provided
financial support for some activities. Television spots were prepared
and broadcast regularly on the main channels. A special issue
of the newspaper &quot;Medicine for you&quot;, focusing on poliomyelitis
eradication matters and the NID, was published by the Ministry
of Health. Some press conferences were organized at the federal
level. The President of the Russian Federation called on the population
of the country to vaccinate children against poliomyelitis. &quot;We
would not let the disease return to our country&quot;, he said
in a statement issued before the NID.
<P>
These efforts resulted in an immunization coverage of 99%. The
lowest level of coverage reported from different territories was
95% (Tchukotka). Special attention was paid to mass vaccination
in the Caucasian region, particularly in Chechnya. There are 10
territories in the Caucasian region and the level of coverage
achieved was 98-99%. In Chechnya, 92% coverage was achieved in
Grozny but, in rural areas, the coverage was as low as 58%. There
was no possibility to conduct immunization activities in three
districts of Chechnya.





<H1><a name="P04">Update on epidemic diphtheria in the newly independent states</A>
(NIS)</H1>

<H2>The situation</H2>

<P>
The epidemiological situation of the diphtheria epidemic in the
NIS has begun to show signs of improvement. After rapid rises
every year between 1990 and 1994, reported diphtheria cases in
the NIS increased only 5%, from the 47,802 reported in 1994 to
50,307 cases in 1995. This reflected an 11% decrease in the Russian
Federation but continued increases in all other NIS countries
except Armenia (see Table 1). In the first quarter of 1996, compared
with the first quarter of 1995, cases have decreased in all NIS
countries except for Turkmenistan.

<P>
All countries have made significant strides towards fully immunizing
their child and adult populations. All countries have moved to
lower childhood contraindications and to avoid the use of low-potency
diphtheria vaccines in the primary series, thereby improving the
proportion of children vaccinated on time with a highly immunogenic
primary series. Many countries have re-instituted a booster dose
at school entry. Schedules for subsequent booster doses among
children vary between countries, although many have instituted
a booster at 11 years and one subsequently before adulthood. All
countries have initiated massive adult immunization, with some
countries reaching one-dose adult coverage above 80%, and above
90% in some cases. Various strategies are being used to attempt
to reach the remaining &quot;hard-to-reach&quot; adults. In addition,
some countries have begun campaigns to administer additional doses
to adults. Some are using prophylactic antibiotics for close contacts
without any signs of adverse effects and these have had the most
dramatic declines in disease incidence in early 1996, suggesting
an additive benefit from such treatment.
<P>
Despite signs of improved control of the diphtheria epidemic,
cases are still occurring at unacceptable levels. In order fully
to implement the recommended control strategies, many countries,
particularly in Central Asia, will continue to need outside assistance,
including vaccine, needles and syringes, antitoxin, antibiotics,
and, very important, laboratory support. While needs remain great,
it is equally important to stress the progress made. Changing
trends in the following countries indicate the implementation
of effective diphtheria control programmes.
<H2>Positive trends in diphtheria control</H2>

<H3>Russian Federation </H3>

<img src="cd12rus.gif" align=left>
Since 1990, the annual diphtheria incidence in the Russian Federation
increased continuously, more than doubling from year to year.
A comparison of the reported diphtheria cases by month showed
a similar trend. Since August 1995, the trend has reversed; this
phenomenon seems to be continuing in 1996. This could be the first
sign of the effect of the implemented control strategy but it
is much too early to consider it a stable trend.

<br clear=left>
<H3>Lithuania</H3>
<img src="cd12lit.gif" align=left>

In 1995, the number of reported diphtheria cases (43) increased
only slightly compared to the number reported in 1994 (38). Since
June 1995, the incidence of diphtheria cases reported
each month) has been lower than in the comparable months in 1994,
and this trend has continued during the first quarter in 1996.
<br clear=left>

<H3>Latvia</H3>
<img src="cd12lat.gif" align=left>

The number of diphtheria cases reported in 1995 was 48% than that
in 1994. Since October 1995, however, this increasing trend seems
to have changed, but the implementation process must be strengthened
to make the control programme as effective as possible.
<br clear=left>

<H3>Republic of Moldova</H3>
<img src="cd12mol.gif" align=left>

The diphtheria cases reported in 1995 (419 cases) were 12% greater
than those in 1994 (372 cases). The usual increase during the
winter season did, however, not occur in 1995. Since October 1995,
the incidence of diphtheria (cases reported per month) has been
lower than in the comparable months in 1994, and this trend has
continued during the first quarter in 1996.
<br clear=left>

<H3>Azerbaijan</H3>
<img src="cd12aze.gif" align=left>

In 1995, the number of reported diphtheria cases (867 cases) increased
only slightly compared to those reported in 1994 (841). Since
November 1995, the incidence of diphtheria cases reported
per month) has been lower than in the comparable months in 1994,
and this trend has continued during the first quarter in 1996.
<br clear=left>

<H3>Tajikistan</H3>
<img src="cd12taj.gif" align=left>

In 1995, the reported diphtheria cases (4455) represented a 133
% increase from 1994 (1912 cases). Since December 1995, however,
there has been no further increase in the incidence reported per
month; in January and February 1996, the reported numbers of diphtheria
cases were lower than in the comparable months in 1995. Since
summer 1995, a mass immunization campaign has been extended to
all parts of the country, supported by the international donor
community and mainly funded by the European Union. The changing
trend of diphtheria incidence could reflect the beginning of the
impact of the control programme.

<H1><a name="P06">IV Interagency Immunization Coordinating Committee Meeting,
(IICC) 29-30 April 1996, Brussels, Belgium</A></H1>


The meeting was hosted by the Commission of the European Union.
It was attended by representatives of Canada, France, Italy, Japan,
Norway, USA, BASICS, USAID, the European Commission Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), IFRCS, the Programme for Appropriate Technology
in Health (PATH), Rotary International, the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), WHO headquarters and the WHO Regional Office for
Europe (host of IICC secretariat).
<P>
Reviewing previous efforts and the current situation, the participants
drew the key conclusion of the meeting, that the NIS continue
to face three closely related problems with respect to immunization
and vaccine-preventable diseases: maintenance of basic immunization
services, eradication of poliomyelitis and control of the current
NIS-wide epidemic of diphtheria. All countries face the issue
of maintenance of services and diphtheria control, although the
relative magnitude of each varies within the region. Transmission
of poliovirus has apparently been interrupted in some countries
and they may be nearing certification while others still require
continuing national immunization days (NIDs) and improvements
in surveillance. During 1995 IICC members donated US$20 millions,
but additional funds mainly to cover 40 millions doses of Td vaccine
is in need, in particular for the central Asian republics, Azerbaijan,
Ukraine and Lithuania. Operation MECACAR 1995-96 was also supported
by IICC members, but there is a need forUS$3.2 millions for vaccine
only in 1997.
<P>
The IICC provisionally holds its next meeting in Copenhagen, 25-26
November 1996.






<H1><a name="P07">Meeting on Evaluation of Measures for Poliomyelitis Eradication</A>
and Diphtheria Control, Berlin, 3-5 June 1996</H1>


The meeting was held with the kind hospitality and generous support
of the German government. Taking stock of efforts made in poliomyelitis
eradication and diphtheria control in NIS, it brought together
representatives of all NIS and the supporting institutions and
agencies: the WHO Regional Office for Europe, WHO headquarters,
UNICEF, IFRCS, Rotary International, USAID, BASICS, PATH and the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Atlanta.
<P>
The participants concluded that the current strategy for polio
eradication is expected to achieve eradication of wild poliovirus
by 1997 in the European region. Evidence for this success includes
the significant drops in reported polio cases following mass immunization
in many countries of the European region (Operation MECACAR/Russian
Federation) in 1995-1996.
<P>
Surveillance for AFP/polio is improving in the countries of the
region but is not yet sufficient to support the needs of the polio
eradication programme and to allow for certification of the region.
Current areas requiring further efforts include training of personnel
in AFP reporting and investigation, setting up national expert
committees, fully establishing the reverse cold chain for transporting
stool specimens, and improving laboratory services.
<P>
The WHO/UNICEF strategy for the control of diphtheria is effective
in controlling the epidemic. Evidence for this includes the progress
reported by several countries that achieved high coverage with
diphtheria toxoid. High coverage (more than 90%) among the entire
population, especially if rapidly achieved, controls disease more
quickly. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy of close contacts appears
to accelerate disease control and has been implemented without
adverse effects in several countries.
<P>
A report of the meeting, including recommendations for the strengthening
of polio eradication and diphtheria control activities, is in
preparation and will be available from WHO Regional Office for
Europe.





<H1><a name="P08">WHO/UNAIDS Meeting</A> on the Epidemics of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases (STDs) in Eastern Europe, 13-15 May 1996.</H1>

<P>
In response to the alarming rise in sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) in NIS reported in CD News 11, the WHO Regional Office
for Europe and United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) jointly
organized an action-oriented meeting of experts from the most
affected countries.
<P>
Objectives of the meeting were to exchange information on the
current situation and actions taken, and to identify priority
actions for the control of the epidemic in the areas of programme
management, prevention, case management and surveillance.
<P>
The participants concluded that all participating countries are
experiencing major epidemics of STDs, especially syphilis, mostly
affecting young people and adolescents. The epidemics appear to
rooted in the rapid social and economic changes occurring in recent
years and the effect of the changes on sexual behaviour and attitudes,
and the accessibility, acceptability and effectiveness of clinical
services. Actions to control these epidemics would include an
assessment of the existing systems for STD control, reallocation
of resources among the various activity areas and strong advocacy
addressing the top level of government to strengthen political
commitment and support.
<P>
The absence of effective national coordination of programmes of
health promotion in the area of sexual health and STD/ HIV prevention
is the most important short-coming of the existing situation.
Further, clinical services are faced with increasing workload
and shrinking resources. The traditional form of case management
(characterized by frequent in-patient care regimes, registration
of personal data with lack of confidentiality and anonymity, and
strong legal obligations imposed on the patient) is becoming impractical
and inefficient. Patients are increasingly unwilling to accept
such conditions and there is consequently a rapid growth in self-treatment
and care provided by medical and non-medical practitioners outside
the legally regulated statutory services.
<P>
Consequently, it is a priority to make statutory services more
accessible and acceptable to patients. Clinical services are well
established in terms of expertise and organizational infrastructure,
but suffer from a major lack of resources. Recognizing the reality
of STD management by non-dermatovenereologists, it is necessary
to find ways to ensure that all those managing patients with STDs
provides high quality care. Training of dermatovenereologists
and other sexual health professionals is in general of a high
standard, but additional training is needed to introduce more
rational approaches in clinical management and health promotion
within STD clinics. The present legislation related to STD control
was largely considered not to be useful in controlling the current
epidemics.
<P>
A report of the meeting is in preparation and will be available
from WHO Regional Office for Europe.





<H1><a name="P09">Dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever</A></H1>

<H2>Malaysia</H2>


The dengue season has started in Malaysia, with 2450 cases reported
throughout the country by 1 June 1996 according to information
from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Dengue/Dengue Haemorrhagic
Fever in Kuala Lumpur. The States most affected are the Federal
Territory, Selangor, Perak, Johor and Pahang. The present season
is expected to continue for the next few months reaching a peak
in July/August. Active vector control measures are in place in
all states.
<H2>Indonesia</H2>

<P>
Over the last five months there have been over 5000 cases of dengue/dengue
haemorrhagic fever and 117 deaths in 11 of the 27 provinces of
Indonesia. The highest number of cases occurred in East Java.
Dengue usually occurs in densely populated areas and a campaign
to educate the public on keeping the environment clean and free
of stagnant water, the breeding place for mosquitoes, has been
stepped up.
<P>
Background information on Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever can be found
in WHO Fact Sheet No. 117





<H1><a name="P10">Lassa fever in Sierra Leone - Update</A></H1>


In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and
the Lassa Fever Research project, the WHO support team with a
specialist from CDC has assessed the extent and severity of the
outbreak after making field trips to Kailahun and Kenema Districts
during 26 and 27 May.
<P>
WHO has provided drugs and supplies for hospitalized patients
through the District Medical Officer in Kenema and specialized
nursing support from CDC has been given. Over 40 health personnel
from the two districts affected attended a workshop organized
by the team which reviewed:- basic epidemiological concepts, the
need for surveillance and the epidemiology and control of Lassa
Fever. A demonstration of barrier nursing techniques was also
given.
<P>
The conclusion of the WHO support mission is that a major epidemic
of Lassa Fever has occurred in Kailahun and Kenema Districts and
is continuing as unusually large numbers of severely ill patients
are still being admitted to hospital, with a large number of deaths
still occurring.
<P>
A total of 167 cases and 60 deaths have been recorded during the
period January to 28 May 1996.





<H1><a name="P11">Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis outbreak on an HIV ward,
Madrid, Spain, 1991-1995</A> </H1>


During June 1991-January 1995, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis
(MDR-TB) was diagnosed in 47 patients and one health-care worker
at a 120-bed, infectious disease referral hospital in urban Madrid.
The outbreak was investigated by the Spanish Field Epidemiology
Training Programme. Findings of this investigation suggest that
nosocomial transmission of MDR-TB occurred on a hospital ward
for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

<P>
<I>(Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 04/26/96</I>
<H1><a name="P05">Imported case of rabies, Italy</A></H1>


On 21 January 1996, a 32-year-old man, visiting Nepal with his
wife, was bitten by a stray puppy in the town of Pokara, Nepal.
The physician consulted in Pokara, having ascertained the immunization
status of the patient with regard to tetanus, did not find any
treatment necessary other than the cleaning and disinfection of
the injury. On 23 January 1996, the man returned to Italy. About
30 days after the man was bitten a symptomatology characterized
by hyperpyrexia appeared, followed by laringeal spasms and hydrophobia
on 23 February 1996. On 24 February the patient was admitted to
the Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Venice and died two days
later.
<P>
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Istitutio Superiore
di Sanit&agrave;, which has characterized the viral strain isolated
by the Institute for Zoonosis of Veneto from cerebral specimens
of the patient as an &quot;India type&quot; rabies virus. Post-exposure
rabies prophylaxis has been administered to the wife and to the
relatives of the patient, and to the assistant who had assisted
the patient at home. The health care personnel of the hospital
followed the universal precaution guidelines and no other prophylactic
intervention was considered necessary.

<P>
The Rio conference emphasized the link between health and sustainability. The achievement of sustainable urban development requires attention to economy, environment, sociodemographic and health issues. Although there is a wide recognition of these principles there is a need for more detailed consideration to show clearly how health and urban sustainability are linked and to produce practical guidance and inspiration for local authorities to take action.<P>
This Multi-City Action Plan (MCAP) aims to create guidance for incorporating concerns for health and sustainable development into long-term strategic plans for local authorities. It was proposed by the WHO Healthy Cities project network. It contributes to the <A HREF="eurosust.htm">European Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns Campaign</A> in which Healthy Cities is a partner network.

<H2>Multi-City Action Plan (MCAP ) </H2>
<H3>Goals </H3>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to contents</A>
<P>
The goal of the MCAP is to develop know-how and mutual support so as to incorporate a concern for health and sustainable development into local authorities' strategic urban planning processes.<P>
This MCAP involves a group of local authorities which are committed to:<UL>
<LI>long term planning for health and sustainable development (<A HREF="http://www.erin.gov.au/portfolio/esd/nsesd/Agenda21.html">Agenda 21</A>);
<LI>working together with other local authorities and WHO for a two to four-year period for information exchange and mutual support;
<LI>documenting and sharing their experiences and contributing to joint products.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </CENTER>
<H2>MCAP structure </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to contents</A>
<P>
The MCAP involves a limited number of local authorities with technical support from WHO and others as appropriate. Member local authorities include some belonging to the WHO Healthy Cities project network and a number of others selected firstly on their commitment to work for the objectives of the group and secondly to achieve geographical balance. Preference is given to those local authorities which are signatories of the <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/europe/echarter.html">Aalborg Charter</A> and are part of the <A HREF="eurosust.htm">European Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns Campaign</A>. Currently there are twelve participating local authorities.
<P>
The main focus of the MCAP will be on incorporating health and sustainable development into long-term strategic planning. Ideally local authorities should have started or completed long-term plans (10 years +) or any strategic plan (prior to a City Master Plan). Examples of such plans include:<UL>
<LI>Guidelines to a Poznan City Master Plan 1993-2005
<LI>Lyon 2010: Towards a Eurocity
<LI>The Greater Toronto Area: Concept for the future 2011
</UL>
<P>
Participating local authorities should be committed to a process of creating a <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/la21/eurola21.html">local Agenda 21</A> plan for long-term sustainable development with a strong health dimension. They should also be interested in meeting together with the technical help of WHO over a period of two to four years.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </CENTER>
<H2>City Representatives </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to contents</A>
<P>
Each city designates two people to be involved in the MCAP. Between them the representatives should have the following attributes:<UL>
<LI>membership of the core strategic planning group of the city;
<LI>familiarity with the principles of sustainable development;
<LI>familiarity with the objectives of the health for all strategy as applied to local authorities;
<LI>good communication skills;
<LI>access to resources in the city for contributing to the work of the MCAP.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </CENTER>
<H2>Phase 1: until the end of 1996 </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to contents</A>
<P>
Phase 1 is oriented towards an exchange of knowledge and experience. It gives local authorities a good understanding of what is going on within the other member local authorities and provides the basis for future collaboration.<H3>Meetings </H3>
<P>
The group will meet twice in 1996. The first meeting was held in Maribor, Slovenia in May 1996 and agreed and initiated the workplan and common outputs. Click <A HREF="hcppub.htm#MCAP">here</A> to read the first report.
<P>
It also agreed an important <A HREF="statemnt.htm">statement on health and local Agenda 21</A>.
<P>
The second meeting will take place in Amadora, Portugal in October 1996 before the <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/europe/lisbon.html">Second Conference of European Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns in Lisbon on 6-8 October 1996</A>. It will review progress on the agreed outputs.
<H3>Outputs </H3>
<P>
The main outputs for 1996 are:<UL>
<LI>A collection of case studies:
</UL>
<P>
Local authorities will be asked to provide case studies on activities related to health and local Agenda 21, including urban policy and planning;<UL>
<LI>A short publication describing how to undertake the integration of health and local Agenda 21.
<LI>A resource guide for local authorities to include an annotated bibliography, materials for teaching and for presentations.
<LI>Handbook: &quot;City planning for health and sustainable development&quot;
</UL>
<P>
The handbook on health and sustainable development is a product which will contribute to the <A HREF="eurosust.htm">European Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns Campaign</A>. A first draft of the handbook will be presented at the <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/europe/lisbon.html">Second Conference of European Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns in Lisbon on 6-8 October 1996</A>. Each city in the MCAP should be willing to contribute towards the handbook on some or all of the following elements:
<UL>
<LI>planning process and agreement on a philosophy and vision (how were the philosophy and vision developed?);
<LI>health and environment problems and causes (how were the problems defined, who has participated in their definition, how was the public involved?);
<LI>tools for community participation (which mechanisms are being used, what were the positive and negative aspects regarding committees, public hearings?);
<LI>working structure and participants;
<LI>processes to elaborate goals and objectives;
<LI>assessments of environment and health issues (problems and causes);
<LI>description of existing state of the local urban environment and health.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </CENTER>
<H2>Phase 2: 1997 onwards </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to contents</A>
<P>
Phase 2 will be oriented towards developmental work in strengthening health preoccupations and developing a healthier urban planning process which will help to achieve sustainable development at the local level. Health preoccupations affect individuals as well as the community as a whole. An important goal will be to develop and suggest mechanisms or tools whereby citizens are more involved in health and environmental issues. The following aspects should be analysed and discussed throughout this phase:<UL>
<LI>establishments of networks
<LI>adoption and use of indicators and standards
<LI>formulation and adoption of objectives
<LI>prioritization of problems
<LI>setting of targets and identification of options
<LI>creation of programmes to address targets
<LI>development of action plans
<LI>implementation and monitoring
<LI>evaluation and feedback.
</UL>
<P>
Drafting of documents will be carried out under the supervision of WHO in close consultation with local authorities.<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </CENTER>
<H2>Funding </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to contents</A>
<P>
Funding for the MCAP comes from three main sources:<OL>
<LI>During the first year some financial assistance will be provided through the European Commission as part of its support to the <A HREF="eurosust.htm">European Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns Campaign</A>.
<LI>WHO will provide technical and administrative support to the MCAP.
<LI>All local authorities which are members of the MCAP are expected to contribute in kind, for example to be willing to make a contribution towards some of the costs of participation in meetings, to host meetings and, most importantly, to work towards the goals of the MCAP.
</OL>
<P>
Some limited funds will be available for local authorities to participate in the work of the MCAP. These will be used in the first instance for local authorities with special needs.<P>

<H2>Introduction </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
Agenda 21 - the programme of action for sustainable development - contains a wide ranging and challenging framework for local, national and global action to create a more sustainable future. It has implications for everyone. It is supported by nearly all European member states and there is a large and growing movement for the creation and implementation of <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/la21/eurola21.html">local Agenda 21</A> action plans.
<P>
Human health and well-being are central to the concern for sustainable development. These notes briefly describe the main parts of Agenda 21 which relate to health. Ideally they should be read in conjunction with the actual document itself. They are intended principally for participants in the <A HREF="eurosust.htm">European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign</A> and members of the WHO Healthy Cities Networks.

<H2>Agenda 21 and the Rio conference </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
<I>Agenda 21</I> - the plan of action emanating from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio in 1992 - is a detailed plan of initiatives which has had a great deal of influence on thinking at all levels:
<UL>
<LI>It stresses the importance of local action in bringing about change.
<LI>The document addresses all major areas of development with a particular emphasis on environmental issues but also considers: international co-operation, combating poverty, human health, and population.
<LI>It emphasizes several key aspects of social development including equal rights and empowerment and education.
<LI>Agenda 21 devotes one chapter to the role of local authorities and places local government as one of the main partners in implementation.
<LI>Around two thirds of the recommendations have implications for cities.
<LI>Planning, local capacity building, community and intersectoral involvement and information are highlighted as processes for implementation.
<LI>The document itself is around 300 pages long and is divided into 4 sections and 40 chapters.
<LI>Several guides to Agenda 21 have been produced, some of them specifically for local governments.
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Health_Agenda"><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </A></CENTER>
<H2>Health in Agenda 21 </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
The most significant parts of Agenda 21 particularly relating to the health aspects of sustainable development in cities are:<H4>Chapter 6 - Protecting and Promoting Human Health </H4>
<P>
This which focuses on five main issues - meeting the urban health challenge, reducing the risks from environmental pollution and hazards, protecting vulnerable groups, control of communicable diseases and meeting primary health care needs. It advocates four main groups of activities to meet the urban health challenge. These are to: <UL>
<LI>develop and implement municipal and local health plans;
<LI>to survey where necessary the existing health, social and environmental conditions in cities, including the documentation of intra urban differences;
<LI>strengthen environmental health services;
<LI>establish and maintain city networks for collaboration and exchange of models of good practice.
</UL>
<H4>Chapter 7 - Promoting Sustainable Human Settlements Development </H4>
<P>
This focuses on seven major issues including provision of adequate shelter for all; human settlements management; sustainable land-use planning and management; integrated provision of environmental infrastructure, including water, sanitation, drainage and solid waste management; sustainable energy and transports systems; planning and management for disaster-prone areas; sustainable construction industry; human resource development and capacity-building.<P>
<I>Paragraph 7.20</I> recommends that the WHO Healthy Cities programme and the Sustainable Cities programme should be intensified to support cities to develop and strengthen their activities along a sustainable path.
<H4>Chapter 28 - Local Authorities initiatives in support of Agenda 21 </H4>
<P>
This stresses the importance of local action and coalitions. Objective 28.3 proposes that by 1996 most local authorities in each country should have undertaken a consultative process with their populations and achieved a consensus on a <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/la21/eurola21.html">local Agenda 21</A> for their community. Since Agenda 21 was agreed much more detailed guidance has emerged on how local authorities can go about undertaking a <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/la21/eurola21.html">local Agenda 21</A> process involving all relevant sectors and the community, with the aim of generating a <A HREF="http://www.iclei.org/la21/eurola21.html">local Agenda 21</A>.
<H4>Other chapters </H4>
<P>
Human health is referred to explicitly in most of the other chapters of Agenda 21. The total number of references is over 200 which include the following additional issues:

<H2>Health themes in Agenda 21 </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
Health can be identified within the sustainable development agenda in the following main ways:<H4>Human health as part of the global ecosystem </H4>
<P>
Human health is sustained by the global ecosystem. Unsustainable development and consequent damage to the system will have a direct and negative effect on human health throughout the world. The industrialized cities of the developed world are responsible for a large proportion of global environmental disruption. For example they are collectively responsible for around 80% of global carbon dioxide emissions.<H4>Health as a focus for development </H4>
<P>
The first principle of the Rio declaration makes this point. 'Human beings are the centre of concern for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.' Improving health goes hand in hand with development. In some areas health improvements are a prerequisite to improvements in other aspects of life. <H4>Health as an outcome of initiatives to promote environmental sustainability </H4>
<P>
Initiatives which are principally taken for environmental reasons should in most instances result in an improvement in human health, though this may not be always explicit. Examples include reduction of accidents and improved physical fitness through transport policies which shift away from cars and towards cycling and walking.<H4>Impact of the health sector on the environment (as well as other sectors) </H4>
<P>
The health sector is one of the largest employers and users of natural resources. It therefore has a key role in ensuring environmental and other benefits from better management of its activities - examples include reductions in hospital energy use. The health sector also has a role in other aspects of Agenda 21 including attention to human rights and the role of women.<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Recommendations"><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </A></CENTER>
<H2>Specific recommendations in Agenda 21 </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
There are many specific recommendations in Agenda 21 about health. Some refer to well defined health issues, but of most significance are those which deal with health in the context of overall development.<P>
Key recommendations relate to the development of municipal health plans and the strengthening for city networks for health.<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="Principles"><IMG src="byline.gif" height=13 width=13> </A></CENTER>
<H2>Principles and methods </H2>
<P>
<A HREF="#Top">Return to top</A>
<P>
Agenda 21 recognizes that many of the issues it covers including health need further elaboration. The health for all strategy and the role of WHO in this are explicitly referred to. Essentially the main principles from Agenda 21 and from the WHO health for all strategy are the same. Particularly when these are applied to the main strategies for implementation of action plans at the local level (see table)

This document is intended to provide guidance and a reference framework for cities that are in the process of introducing a Healthy City project or are reviewing and expanding an existing one.<P>
It describes the three phases of development of a Healthy Cities project: start-up, project organization and areas for action and strategic work.
<P>
The document is based on the insights and experience gained from the first implementation phase of the WHO Healthy Cities project.

Comprehensive city health profiles are key products of the Healthy Cities project. They provide the evidence and the credibility for serious efforts to promote health at the local level. They act as the basis for advocacy, the setting of priorities and accountability for health. Profiles are about the health of people and about the conditions in which they live.<P>
Profiles are essential tools for change and must thus be an integral part of local decision-making and strategic planning processes. The preparation of profiles creates unique opportunities for intersectoral work and community and media involvement.<P>
This document is intended to provide guidance and a reference framework to cities, towns and municipalities that belong to the Healthy City movement.

The Healthy Cities project is a fast growing movement. Capturing the tangible edge of the project and documenting cities' activities are essential to its development. This document gives a glimpse of the wealth of activities initiated or brought under the project umbrella in cities that were part of the Healthy Cities network during 1987-1992.<P>
The 49 case studies presented here show in concrete terms how cities can implement the Healthy Cities idea in the main areas of the WHO strategy of health for all.

Investing in the health and the environment of cities means investing in the future, the survival and prosperity of our growing urban societies. This document is about translating theory into practice. The examples are drawn from the experiences and innovative initiatives of cities that participate in the WHO Healthy Cities movement and the OECD Ecological Cities Congress.<P>
The document details the leading edge of international experience and provides insights into the process of change from a selection of case studies and keynote speeches presented at the International Healthy and Ecological Cities conference held in Madrid on 22-25 March 1995.<P>
The document provides concrete examples of good practices and supportive mechanisms for change at local, national and international levels.

The tools presented in this book represent the quantitative and qualitative approaches to data collection that have been reported as useful to selected Healthy Cities researchers and community leaders. Community leaders may recognize their need for information, but may not know how to identify the tools that can help them meet their requirements. This book is designed to help these leaders identify where to focus their initial efforts and information needs.

<H2>Continuing education for change</H2>
<P>
By C.E. Engel, J. Vysohlid and V.A. Vodoratski<BR>
WHO Regional Publications,<BR>
European Series, No. 28<BR>
1990, xv + 93 pages [E]<BR>
ISBN 92 890 1119 X<BR>
Sw.fr. 12.-<BR>
Order No. 1310028<P>
<P>
This book sets out specific principles for continuing education for health professionals
that take account of changing national health needs and emphasize primary health care.
Calling for more than a passive acceptance of information intended to maintain existing
skills, the book urges a more active role for continuing education and the health
professionals who take part; the goal is to gain and use new knowledge and skills to meet
the evolving needs of the health care system and the community.<P>
The book opens with an outline of the key principles of planning, running, evaluating and
organizing multiprofessional continuing education for change. These principles are
followed by a summary of the work that formed their basis. One chapter describes the
insight gained from 19 country reports and 10 case studies of the WHO programme on
continuing education. The next makes recommendations for realizing the promise of
continuing education, through the cooperation of health authorities and personnel to build
well planned programmes with adequate resources and official status. The remainder of
the book comprises summaries of the country reports and case studies and provides a
select bibliography and a glossary of terms.<P>

<h1 align=center>The World Health Organization</h1>
<hr>
is a specialized agency of the United Nations with primary responsibility for international health matters and public health. Through this Organization, which was created in 1948, the health professions of over 180 countries exchange their knowledge and experience with the aim of making possible the attainment by all citizens of the world a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life. <p>

The WHO Regional Office for Europe is one of six regional offices throughout the world, each with its own programme geared to the particular health problems of the countries it serves. The European Region embraces some 850 million people living in an area stretching from Greenland in the north and the Mediterranean in the south to the Pacific shores of Russia. The European programme of WHO therefore concentrates both on the problems associated with industrial and post-industrial society and on those faced by emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In its strategy for attaining the goal of health for all the Regional Office is arranging its activities in three main areas: lifestyles conducive to health, a healthy environment, and appropriate services for prevention, treatment and care. <p>

The European Region is characterized by the large number of languages spoken by its peoples, and the resulting difficulties in disseminating information to all who may need it. Applications for rights of rights of translation of Regional Office books are therefore most welcome.

<H1 align=center>Foreword</H1>
<hr>
Regular monitoring and evaluation of countries' progress towards health for all are an important part of the policy adopted by the WHO European Region in 1984. This book presents the results of the 1993/1994 round of monitoring. Since the large-scale evaluation of 1990/1991, the Region has changed in many ways. This report gives a concise account of the new situation.<P>
The Member States of central and eastern Europe and the former USSR, with hundreds of millions of people, have continued to undergo a dizzying array of political, economic and social changes. These have had profound effects on daily life, health and the stability of society. Some countries are in the throes of armed conflict, which have taken a terrible toll on their health, societies and economies. In addition, the transition to market economies and more liberal social arrangements has continued to create enormous difficulties in health development.<P>
A widening gap in health separates the eastern and western halves of the Region. Health problems in the eastern countries include stagnating life expectancy, more premature deaths from chronic disease, outbreaks of communicable disease (particularly diphtheria) and increasing numbers of accidents. Finally, the standards of living are declining for a large part of the population, particularly elderly people in urban areas. Substandard housing and nutrition and now decreasing health care create conditions threatening the health of many millions of people.<P>
The western countries of the Region have seen a much more encouraging health situation. Most have continued to make progress against both communicable and noncommunicable diseases. Here, the consolidation of the European Union is creating a more stable environment for health development in many countries.<P>
Thus, the underlying structure of national and international interrelations in the Region has changed profoundly, with important implications for health. All countries are searching for new or more effective forms of integration, although the obstacles to, speed of and expected outcomes of this pursuit differ.<P>
The obvious challenge for health authorities is to find an adequate response to this major shift. Policies for health for all provide the overall strategy for future health development. Implementing them, however, requires public health knowledge and techniques to manage change in society. The aim is to achieve optimal health gains through sensible action that targets the determinants of health and that continuously measures the outcomes of intervention in terms of their health impact. This requirement applies to the full range of actions to improve health, from multisectoral efforts to improve health and prevent disease and accidents to the daily work of physicians and other health care providers at the clinical level.<P>
A number of aspects, however, need further emphasis in the years ahead. Health care financing and infrastructures, and public health action should be adapted to sustain minimal economic growth and ease the pressures of social disruption. This requires continuous emphasis on effficiency, effectiveness and quality of care. In addition, building networks and partnerships needs a higher place on the health and social policy agenda. Health policies should become more tangible to citizens, not only providing strong leadership by health professionals but also creating broader understanding and support of health targets in sectors other than health, nongovernmental organizations, communities and the people themselves.<P>
As societies in the Region give increasing importance to information and knowledge as tools for health development, more resources should be devoted to reaching good standards in education, training, research and information systems for health. Investing in these areas is vital for future health development, and Member States and the Regional Office will work together in this direction, as part of their progress towards health for all.<P>

<H1 align=center>Introduction</H1>

<hr>


This is a report on health in Europe. It describes the health status of the people of the WHO European Region, outlines the most relevant determinants of their health and identifies the main public health actions that influence it. The report therefore highlights the progress achieved and the different experiences of countries of the Region in pursuing their policy for health for all.<P>

At the thirtieth session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe, in September 1980, the Member States of the European Region approved their first common health policy: the European strategy for attaining health for all. The Regional Committee adopted 38 specific regional targets to implement this strategy at its thirty-fourth session, in September 1984. In addition, 65 essential regional indicators or groups of indicators, incorporating the 12 global indicators, were proposed to be used as a means of assessing progress towards the attainment of the targets. a) The forty-first session of the Regional Committee, in 1991, approved an updated version of the 38 regional targets and a list of indicators. b)<P>

b) <I>Health for all targets. The health policy for Europe. </I>Copenhagen, WHO Regional Office for Europe, 1993 (European Health for All Series, No. 4).<P>

By asking the Regional Office to carry out a full evaluation of progress every six years and to monitor the situation between these evaluations, the Member States also made a commitment to report and compare their achievements, as they cooperated in a Region-wide public health movement. Several countries have gradually developed capacities for monitoring and evaluating public health policies and action, and produced highly comprehensive and relevant reports. Countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom often facilitate and reinforce this work by the publication of public health reports.<P>

Many Member States in the eastern part of the Region are "new countries". For them, this exercise comes closer to "baseline" reporting than to monitoring of progress towards health for all. This report uses country groupings - such as the countries of central and eastern Europe (CCEE) or the newly independent states (NIS) of the former USSR - to analyse health status in the Region. These terms retain considerable usefulness in describing established socioeconomic and health patterns in the Region, particularly the very significant "east-west gap".<P>

The feasibility of monitoring and evaluation and the precision and validity of the assessments vary extensively, according to the more quantitative or qualitative nature of the issues, targets and indicators concerned, the existence of standardized definitions and rules of procedure for information collection, and the way these are applied in different countries. Ten years of experience in monitoring and evaluation at the regional level has shown that some form of health intelligence system in the Regional Office is vital for assessing and reporting on health in the spirit of health for all. This includes the extensive and systematic use of expert advice and consultation to evaluate, analyse and complement the reporting by countries. In this process, the Regional Office gradually developed an extensive information infrastructure to support an increasingly sharper Regional Office public health knowledge base (Annex 1).<P>
This report summarizes current public health knowledge about Europe. It has been designed to become widely available and accessible, as will the information infrastructure that underpins it. In addition, the Regional Office will issue regular updates. The aim is to increase awareness for public health action in the Region, so that health for all can become a more meaningful goal for all the people of the European Region.

<h1 align=center>1. The prerequisites for health
</H1>
<hr>

<h4><a href="part0h.htm">Go back to contents</A></h4>

<h4><a href="/policy/hfa01.htm#P02">Health for all, target 2</A></h4>

Health and wellbeing are inextricably linked to the overall conditions of life. The prerequisites
for both health and healthy living include feeling free from life's threats, and having meaningful
roles and functions in society, proper education, a decent home, and the necessary earnings to
meet basic needs. These factors have increased their influence on the health of the population in
the European Region more strongly than ever since the launching of the strategy for health for
all.<P>
<H2><a href="/country/members.htm">The 50 countries of the European Region</A></H2>
When the WHO Regional Committee for Europe met for its forty-fourth annual session in
Copenhagen in September 1994, the Region embraced 50 Member States. The 12 CCEE and the
15 NIS can be viewed as having economies in transition from central planning to a market
economy. The Region also contains 21 countries situated in northern, southern and western
Europe. They are highly industrialized and mostly densely populated, and have developed market
economies. Turkey and Israel, although differing in many respects, are also Member States of the
Region.<P>
The countries in the Region vary widely in their level of economic development (Annex 2). With
the gross national product (GNP) per head as a main criterion, 24 countries could be found in the
middle-income group (with a GNP per head of US$ 635-7909) and 18 could be found in the
high-income group in 1991. These differences are likely to continue to shape how people live
and work.<P>



<H2>Aging in Europe: implications for
health</H2>
The demographic background is important for understanding the present and future health
situation in the European Region. Long-term trends in population growth tend to converge.
According to earlier United Nations projections, future increases in the population of the Region
will take place mainly in some NIS and Turkey.<P>
Recent figures show some divergence, however, with growth rates decreasing for the CCEE and
NIS, and increasing elsewhere in the Region. Falling birth rates contributed to very low or
negative growth rates in most of the CCEE and NIS (Fig. 1.1). Age-specific fertility rates also
tend to converge and decline (Fig. 1.2) except in the central Asian republics of the NIS, Albania
and Turkey. If the central Asian republics are not considered, the NIS show fertility patterns like
those of the CCEE.<P>

<h4>See: <a href="fig11.gif">Fig. 1.1 Birth rates in selected countries of the European Region, 1980-1992</A></h4><p>

a) United Nations demographic classification of countries.<p>

A most important development throughout the Region appears to be the further aging of the
population. The proportion of people over 65 years of age, especially the very old, will continue
to rise (Fig. 1.3). The extraordinary reduction in birth rate in most of the NIS, comparable to the
effect of war, has accelerated population aging. The combined effects of aging and declining
fertility influence the conditions under which children are growing up, raise questions about the
claims and social role of elderly people and pose major economic and health challenges for the
future.<P>

<h4>See: <a href="fig13.gif">Fig. 1.3 Estimates and projections of the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in the European Region a), 1980-2020</A></h4>
a) United Nations demographic classification of countries.<p>
Source: <i>World population prospects 1950-2025.</i><p>

In addition to the continuing demographic transformation of the Region, lasting migration from
south to north and east to west continued to create a critical situation with respect to the
prerequisites for health. Migration defies the capacities of social systems to integrate different
ethnic groups and can create imbalances in the availability of appropriately qualified human
resources in the countries that gain people as well as those that lose them.<P>
On the positive side, the feared massive emigration from east to west did not materialize,
according to the reporting system on migration of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development. Rather, the trends point towards organized temporary migration, which
showed little growth or even falling numbers after 1989-1991. Germany was the main destination
of migration from east to west. In addition, the lack of rapid population increase could be seen as
a positive effect, avoiding burdens inflicted on other regions in the world.<P>
<H2>War affecting eight countries of the
Region</H2>
In 1992 alone, wars affected at least eight countries in the Region: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Each conflict involved one or more
governments and caused the death of 1000 or more people per year.<P>
During the past two years, armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia killed more than 150 000
people, wounded hundreds of thousands, and displaced close to 4 million. In other countries, too,
fighting continued to take its toll of suffering and damage. In addition to these obvious and
immediate effects, war and conflict cause the deterioration of the social environment, with a
long-lasting negative impact on people's health and wellbeing.<P>
In most other countries in the Region, including Israel, however, the threat of military
confrontation has decreased, bringing a significant peace dividend. As noted in a recent report
from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), this dividend is the resources saved
by reducing military spending. European nations realized very considerable savings from
reducing military expenditure between 1960 and 1990. The percentage of gross domestic product
(GDP) devoted to military expenditure fell from 4.7% to 2.9% in the countries of the European
Union (EU), from 2.7% to 2.3% in the Nordic countries, and from 11% to 10% in the former
USSR. In addition to reducing direct military expenditure, the ratio of this expenditure to
combined expenditure on education and health largely fell, except in the former USSR.<P>
Unfortunately, there was no easy way to account for the use of these savings. An effective way
should therefore be found fully to harness these funds. This will be an important item on the
agenda of the World Summit on Social Development, to be held in Copenhagen in 1995.<P>
In particular, health authorities in all countries should take a lead in mobilizing the social sector
to develop and discuss, in appropriate fora, coherent and realistic policies for devoting the peace
dividend to national human and health development, and to international assistance needs. It
seems strange that work on social development and health problems in many countries appears to
be more difficult to finance when military budgets are falling than when they were rising.<P>
<H2>Social tension from economic recession
and unemployment</H2>
In general, eastern countries have seen five successive years of falling activity. The aggregate
decline of output since 1989 was over 30% by the end of 1992, and possibly around 40% by 1993
(Fig. 1.4).<P>

<h4>See: <a href="fig14.gif">Fig. 1.4 Percentage change in GDP over the preceding year, 1990-1994</A></h4>
Source: Adapted from <i>Economic survey of Europe.</I><p>


For most western European countries, the economic situation has been marked by a long
recession. Hopes for prompt recovery at the start of the decade proved to be little more than
wishful thinking. Unemployment rates rose from about 8% in 1991 to over 11% in early 1994,
with several countries facing much sharper increases. For example, unemployment grew from
7.5% to 17.7% in Finland and from 16.0% to 22.4% in Spain. In 1993, standardized
unemployment rates over 10% were observed in France (11.6%), Ireland (15.8%), Italy (10.2%)
and the United Kingdom (10.3%). Registered unemployment was 12.3% in Denmark. Among
the almost 35 million unemployed people in the western part of the European Region, particular
concern must be given to the increasing number of long-term unemployed, who risk gradual loss
of skills as well as marginalization: being ostracized as inferior to others, not only in the labour
market but also in society. Long-term unemployment is a particular problem for the Region.
Many people of working age were discouraged from seeking work or had to become parttime
workers, as was often the case for women. Most important, unemployment rates are usually
highest among young people; youth unemployment is around 30% in France, Italy and Spain.
This may have serious implications for wellbeing in the Region.<P>




<H2>Signs of recovery in the west in
1994</H2>
Nevertheless, recent data indicate that the most difficult phase of the economic recession in the
west, and the transition to market economies in the east, is probably over.<P>
Economic growth in the western countries was expected to rise to some 1.5% in 1994. Most
recently, the GDP forecast for Germany was higher than expected, a distinct improvement in an
economy that is very important for the CCEE. In eastern Europe, Poland was first to show a
1.5% increase in GDP in 1992, and 4.0% in 1993. Signs of recovery could also be detected in the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The
situation remains critical, however, in the countries at war and in several NIS.<P>
The situation with respect to the prerequisites for health has worsened in many repects since the
end of the 1980s. In general, however, promising signs of recovery and the initiation of more
favourable conditions for investment in health can be seen. If GDP in 1985 is taken as 100%,
some analysts predict that it will be about 160% in western Europe, about 135% in the CCEE and
about 115% in the NIS in 2005.<P>
<H2>Increased social exclusion, poverty and
homelessness</H2>
Inevitably, the severe consequences of political and economic problems spread across the
Region. Migrants and refugees continued to concentrate in urban areas, where they frequently
joined other socially marginalized people. This situation has resulted in critical sanitary and
living conditions, particularly substandard housing and homelessness. More people in several
underprivileged groups lived below the poverty level. In different eastern European countries,
such people comprised from 11 % to almost 40% of the population; in the EU, the average was
close to 15%.<P>
In addition, inequities in income increased in almost all countries of the Region. Related to this is
an increased uncertainty about social and economic prospects. The mechanisms through which
these trends affect health and wellbeing are very complex and difficult to disentangle, but there is
little doubt that they are related to various kinds of health risks and damage: rapidly eroding
social support structures, declining birth rates (particularly in the east) and a high incidence of
psychosocial and mental health problems.<P>
<H2>Apparent surge in violence</H2>
With economic pressures and social tension, threats against personal security also surfaced
rapidly throughout the Region. Apart from the open fighting mentioned above, violent behaviour
on the streets, and against women, children and the elderly showed disturbing trends.<P>
In almost all countries risk to life was greater than ever before. While this was particularly true
for the CCEE and NIS, the homicide rates also increased rapidly in the Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy and Portugal in the late 1980s. Drug trafficking was widely believed to be
connected to the increase in crime. UNDP reported that drug-related crimes in Denmark and
Norway, for example, were estimated roughly to have doubled in the second half ofthe
1980s.<P>
Although grossly underreported, violence against women was recognized to show alarming
proportions in all countries. Domestic violence and rape cause morbidity and mortality in
women. In industrialized countries, domestic assaults have been reported to cause more injuries
to women than motor vehicle accidents, rapes and muggings combined.<P>
In addition, accidents on the road and at work continued to pose major risks to life and health,
particularly in the NIS.<P>
<H2>More democracy and better prospects for
investing in social welfare?</H2>
The fundamental improvement of the overall social and political climate should be considered if
balanced conclusions are to be reached. Four rather encouraging general conditions need to be
better understood and translated into action to improve the living conditions of those in need.<P>
East-west confrontation having ceased, democracy is being restored in many of the CCEE and
NIS, and political dialogue has been strengthened. Intensified cooperation within the EU may
stimulate improvements to the prerequisites for health.<P>
While the process of transition in the CCEE and NIS brought about new problems, it also offered
opportunities to consider health needs in a much more consistent and determined way, under the
new legislative, political and managerial arrangements.<P>
Reducing military expenditure resulted in substantial savings. Health authorities have an
important role to play in discussing the use of the "peace dividend".<P>
Investing in health by meeting urgent health needs can create jobs, even if not in the traditional
form of employment for health professionals. Here, health authorities can actively stimulate and
promote innovative approaches.<P>
<H2>From prerequisites to health
development</H2>
The links between the main prerequisites for health and development in lifestyles and health are
complex and cannot always be charted. Nevertheless, the practical and scientific evidence is
more than sufficient to show their decisive role in shaping the health experience of different
populations, social groups and individuals. This understanding and perspective form the basis for
the further examination of the trends in health in the Region.<P>

<hr>


<h4><a href="part0h.htm">Go back to contents</A></h4>





<H2>Constraints of data and methods</H2>
The health of people and populations has to be assessed with a wide range of measures, ranging from "hard" data on mortality, through disability and morbidity data, to the subjective perception of health and various aspects of the quality of life.<P>

Although the chances for sufficiently accurate measurement vary widely, the data on mortality and the incidence of infectious diseases, and, to some extent, hospital statistics are still the best available. Mortality data for international analysis are at present available from almost all countries of the Region, except Monaco, San Marino, Turkey and some countries that emerged from the former Yugoslavia. The insufficient availability and comparability of data on noncommunicable diseases or disability, not to mention measures of the quality of life, are major obstacles to the complete assessment of health status. For these reasons, composite indicators, such as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), disability-free life expectancy or health expectancy, could not be used for comparisons in the Region, because the non-mortality components of these indicators are lacking.<P>

Life expectancy at birth is therefore the main global indicator used to assess health, as it summarizes mortality patterns in the population. Available data on morbidity, disability and quality of life are taken into account to cast some light on other aspects of health in the European Region.<P>

Since the last health for all evaluation, in 1990/1991, the European Region has become more heterogeneous, with countries ranging from world-leading market economies, with correspondingly high levels of health, to countries with health indicators that show a pattern close to that of developing countries. In this situation, assessing the health status of the Region as a whole is not always meaningful. Assessments were mostly made of groups of countries with similar health status patterns or trends. The groups were constructed according to purely technical criteria related to the availability and comparability of historical data series<P>

In general, the following groupings were used: the 15 NIS, the CCEE (6 countries: Bulgaria, the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the former Yugoslavia), the 12 EU countries and the 5 Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden). Certain countries are therefore not covered by these group comparisons. The main focus of the analysis is the east-west gap in health and the impact of the current socioeconomic difficulties in the CCEE and NIS.<P>



<a name="t06"><H2>Greater inequities in health: the widening east-west gap in life expectancy</A></H2>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P06">Health for all, target 6</A></h4>

The increase in the east-west gap in life expectancy and mortality started in the 1960s and 1970s. The gap widened further in recent years, mainlv because of the rather sharp deterioration of health in most of the NIS and some CCEE (Fig. 2.1). All countries in southern, northern and western Europe show a further steady increase in life expectancy, although with some variations in growth rate. The average for the CCEE increased very slowly and has been stable since 1990, although the patterns vary within this group.<P>


<h4>See: <a href="fig21.gif">Fig. 2.1 Trends in life expectancy at birth in the European Region, 1970-1992</A></h4>
Source: data from the WHO Regional Office for Europe<p>


Further to the east, the situation is more complicated and dramatic. According to the preliminary 1993 data available for several NIS, life expectancy dropped to the lowest levels seen for decades.<P>
<P>

Considering the long-term increase in the east-west gap in life expectancy, the question is: which diseases contribute most? The answer could point to the possible strategies needed to narrow the gap. In 1992, the average life expectancy for the CCEE and NIS was about 7.3 years less for males, 4.9 years less for females and about 6 years less for both sexes combined; life expectancy for both sexes was 75.6 years in the west and 69.6 in the east.<P>








About half of the gap is due to mortality differentials in cardiovascular diseases in people over the age of 35 years (Table 2.1). External causes of death, particularly in the middle-aged population, are the second largest contributor. Respiratory diseases are a more common cause of infant death in the CCEE. In total, cardiovascular diseases are responsible for more than 50% of the present gap, and external causes and respiratory diseases, for 23% and 16%, respectively. Infectious and parasitic diseases contribute about 7%.<P>

From the point of view of age, the main contribution to the gap comes from the group aged 35-64 years (43%), followed by older people (23%) and infants (15%).<P>

When measuring the east-west health gap in relative terms, virtually all causes of death that are used as health for all indicators show a particularly dramatic widening (Fig. 2.2). Even the "positive" balance in mortality from breast cancer in women aged under 65 years is gradually shrinking.<P>

The significant improvements in Romania were the main cause of the decrease in the east-west ratio of maternal mortality between 1985 and 1992. Mortality from homicide in the east reached a level more than 10 times higher than that in the rest of the Region. Infant mortality and premature mortality from cardiovascular diseases are about three times higher in the east, and premature total mortality is about two times higher.<P>
<H2>Health decline in the NIS</H2>
Detailed mortality data for the former USSR and its constituent republics became available for international analysis in the late 1980s. Historical mortality and life expectancy trends in the NIS are complicated and need special in-depth analysis. The current trends in life expectancy have three components: a long-term secular trend, the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign in the former USSR in the mid-1980s, and the current difficulties of transition. Since the 1960s, life expectancy has stagnated in most NIS. The 1970s saw a continuous slight decline, with some temporary improvement in the first half of the 1980s. In 1985-1987, most probably owing to the anti-alcohol campaign, life expectancy rose sharply. In terms of mortality, the average annual health gain in the former USSR was about 100 lives saved per 100 000 population. For example, life expectancy in the Russian Federation increased by 3.2 years for males and 1.3 years for females between 1984 and 1987. The highest point was reached in 1986/1987 and a subsequent gradual decline started with a sharp fall during 1992/1993, most probably attributable to the socioeconomic crisis (Fig.2.3).<P>

The main difficulty in assessing the net impact on NIS mortality of the present economic crisis is the distortion of secular trends in life expectancy by the anti-alcohol campaign. The simplest assump tion is that all gains above the 1984 or 1985 level (the campaign started on 1 June 1985) are due to the campaign and that the decline below this level is attributable to the current economic difficulties. Using 1985 as a baseline, life expectancy in 1992 was 0.4 years below this point in the Russian Federation (for both sexes), and 0.9 years in Ukraine and 0.1 years in Lithuania. Preliminary data for 1993, however, indicate a further, particularly sharp decline, pushing life expectancy below the levels observed in the 1960s or even the 1950s.<P>
 In summary, the restoration of the previous alcohol-related mortality patterns probably accounts for the decline in life expectancy until about 1991/1992. From 1992, the economic crisis and other problems related to the transition to a market economy are most probably responsible for the further deterioration. Trends in alcohol consumption (including that of unregistered alcohol) support this view; consumption in the Russian Federation in 1992, for example, reached the level of 1984 (Fig. 2.4).<P>


<a href="fig24.gif">Fig. 2.4 Alcohol consumption and mortality in the Russian Federation, 1981-1992</A><p>
Source: data from the WHO Regional Office.<p>



 The analysis of the components of the 1984-1987 gains and the 1987-1992 losses in life expectancy indicates that both were largely attributable to the same causes and the same population group: external causes (accidents, homicide, suicide) followed by cardiovascular diseases, particularly for middleaged men. The mechanisms of such an impact are not clear and need further investigation.<P>

Preliminary 1993 mortality data for Estonia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and the Russian Federation unanimously show unfavourable trends, pushing life expectancy back to levels observed decades ago. This fall affected males most. For example, life expectancy for males in the Russian Federation was estimated to be 59 years, which is below retirement age. The component analysis confirmed that the same causes of death continue to play a leading role. During 1993, out of the total loss of 3 years of life expectancy for Russian males, 1.14 years (38%) were lost to the increase in accidents, homicide and suicide, 0.97 years (32%) to cardiovascular diseases and 0.9 years to all other diseases.<P>

Only a relatively small proportion of the mortality increase in the NIS can be attributed to problems in the health services (such as some of the increase in deaths from infectious and parasitic or respiratory diseases), although shortcomings in these services significantly affected the provision and quality of care. Most of the increased mortality is attributable to socioeconomic and living conditions, combined with lifestyle-related behavioural factors, such as accidents, violence and homicide, suicide, stress and alcohol-related cardiovascular deaths.<P>
See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P07">Health for all, target 7</A></h4>

Taking account of the current extremely low levels of life expectancy in the NIS, some recovery in the near future is more likely than a further deterioration. The main difficulties of the first vears of transition to a market economy also seem to be more or less over, as indicated above.<P>
<H2>The CCEE: a mid-point between east and west</H2>
Health status in the CCEE could be placed between the deteriorating trends in the east and the improvements in the west. Countries within this group vary, however, both in current levels of life expectancy and recent trends. For example, life expectancy in Hungary began to fall in 1989, after a rather significant improvement in 1986-1988. It dropped slightly in the former Czechoslovakia and Poland around 1989/1990, but increased again in 1992. Life expectancy improved in Romania between 1987 and 1991, with some drop in 1992. (The most recent drop in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania may be attributed in part to the noticeably lower post-census population figures provided by these countries.)<P>

The data for 1992 show a rise in life expectancy in Albania and the Czech Republic. For Albania, however, detailed mortality data, on which life expectancy is based, were received for the first time very recently and their completeness still needs to be checked.<P>

In general, the data available on the CCEE point more towards a further slow increase or stagnation than to a significant decline in life expectancy, except perhaps in Hungary. If the economic difficulties of the transition are reflected in life expectancy, this effect is still no bigger than several temporary fluctuations in the past. A more definite answer can only be given in a historical perspective.<P>

<H2>Western Europe's life expectancy: approaching limits for improvement</H2>

Twenty Member States from the north, west and south of Europe, for which mortality data are available, lead the Region in life expectancy. In this group, life expectancy ranges from 78.8 years in Iceland to 74.4 in Portugal. It has constantly improved for the whole group for at least the last two decades, although countries differ in the rate of growth.<P>
Comparing the relative position of countries between 1980 and 1991/1992, Denmark shows the most unfavourable change (falling from tenth to eighteenth place), followed by Norway and the Netherlands (Fig. 2.5). The Danish Ministry of Health launched a special investigation into the reasons for this change. It found that one of the largest contributors to the excess mortality in Denmark was cancer mortality in women. The high rates of smoking (particularly among women), alcohol consumption and unemployment, and the early entry of women into the labour market were reported as the main causes of the relatively unfavourable development in life expectancy in Denmark.<P>

Portugal showed the opposite trend. Life expectancy was rather low in the 1970s but rose rapidly, significantly reducing the gap between Portugal and other western countries.<P>

Since almost all western countries have passed the health for all target of 75 years' life expectancy, what is the potential for further improvement? To answer this question, the current feasible life expectancy was calculated from a life-table that was constructed using the lowest age-specific mortality rates observed in any country of the Region. At present, feasible life expectancy is 77.2 years for males, 83.3 years for females and 79.8 for both sexes combined. Another way of estimating the upper limit to life expectancy is to set premature mortality at zero. Assuming the total elimination of mortality before 65 years and unchanged present mortality at older ages, life expectancy would increase by only 45 years in countries such as Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. This means that a slowing of the rise in life expectancy may be expected. Actually, signs of a reduction of increase can be seen in the above countries when the average annual slopes in the periods 19801985 and 19851991 are compared.<P>

<a name="t07"><H2>Falling infant and maternal mortality: concern about some exceptions</A></H2>

<h4>



Infant mortality ranges from 58 per 1000 live births in most Nordic and western European countries to over 40 in some central Asian republics. Trends show a continuous decline across the Region, although a slight increase took place after 1990 in some of the NIS and CCEE. I'art of the increase, at least in several NIS, can be attributed to the introduction of the international definition of live birth. For the last 2-3 years, most NIS have given very high priority to the issue of child health, and some reinforced this by formulating policies, strategies and programmes.<P>
Maternal mortality has a similar distribution and trend. It ranges from zero in small countries, or about 3 deaths per 100 000 live births in Greece, to over 60 in Kyrgyzstan and even higher numbers in Turkey. While maternal mortalitv shows a general decline, there are signs of increase in some countries, mainly the NIS and CCEE. Particularly noteworthy is the case of Romania, where illegal abortions had led to extremely high maternal mortality. Such deaths declined sharply after the abolition of an anti-abortion law. On average, however, about a quarter of all maternal death is attributable to abortion, and many countries reduced these deaths by improving family planning.<P>


<a name="t09"><H2>Cardiovascular diseases: potential for health gain through prevention</A></H2>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P09">Health for all, target 9</A></h4>


Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in the Region. They cause about half of all deaths and about one third of permanent disability, and are responsible for a large proportion of health care costs. CVD are also the main component in the east-west mortality gap. This means that even a small relative reduction in CVD mortality would yield a noticeable gain in absolute terms.<P>
Many epidemiological studies have shown that risk factors related to lifestyle play a key role in the development of CVD. Smoking, unhealthy nutrition and low physical activity, for example, lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol and overweight. Observation and intervention studies suggest a wide variation in risk factor levels between countries, which is likely to be related to variation in CVD rates. This indicates a large potential for preventive action in the Region (Fig. 2.6).<P>

Although differences in risk factors can largely explain the differences in premature death from CVD, other factors could have contributed to the mortality decline in western countries. These include socioeconomic differences, advances in medical technology and changes in the availability, accessibility and use of hospital and ambulatory care.<P>
The experience of community control programmes, initiated in the 1970s by the Regional Office, for Europe shows that planned, coordinated intersectoral effort can lower risk factors in the community. Further, more and more countries are deve-loping and implementing national strategies to prevent CVD by reducing the levels of these factors.<P>




<a name="t10"><H2>Cancer: some progress in the west</A></H2>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P10">Health for all, target 10</A></h4>



Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality, and is responsible for about 20% of deaths in the Region. Here, too, the CCEE and NIS show trends diverging from those in other Member States (Fig. 2.7). Although past trends in the western countries were unfavourable, the most recent data show a slight improvement for 1991/1992. Since the last evaluation of progress towards health for all, more western countries are experiencing declining trends or steeper declines.<P>


<a href="fig27.gif">Fig. 2.7 Standardized death rates from cancer in the European Region, age 0-64, 1970-1992</A><p>

The diverging trends in cancer mortality between eastern and western countries are largely due to mortality from cancer of the lung, the digestive<P>
organs and the cervix. Higher rates of smoking can explain the higher rates of lung cancer in the eastern countries. Cancer of the digestive organs is decreasing in the western European countries; this can be related to changes in nutritional patterns. Eastern countries show no clear trend.<P>
Cervical cancer in women is a rather special case; it is decreasing in all countries, although much more in western Europe than in the east.<P>
In most countries, deaths from cancer in people under 65 are about twice as high in men as in women. Some north-western countries, however, such as Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom, are exceptions to this rule. They show a high female cancer mortality, comparable to or even exceeding male mortality. As mentioned with regard to life expectancy in Denmark, the most probable reason for this is the adoption by women of some aspects of lifestyle that had previously been considered the province of men, particularly smoking.<P>
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) regularly analyses the recent trends in cancer mortality and incidence. The latest IARC report indicates that tobacco-related cancer is on the increase, particularly among females. All other types of cancer are showing either stable or slightly decreasing trends.<P>

External causes are the third leading cause of death in industrialized countries, and make a special contribution to the east-west health gap. Mortality from external causes is increasing in almost all the NIS and CCEE, and declining in most other countries of the Region.<P>
Accidents are the biggest single cause of death and disability among young people. The transition to a market economy in the NIS and CCEE is associated with increasing social violence, weakening occupational safety measures and growing psychological stress related to uncertainties about and an inability to cope with the new social and economic conditions. All this, combined with the effect of excessive alcohol consumption in some NIS, is reflected in the increase in mortality from external causes of death, particularly from homicide.<P>
According to the latest available data, standardized mortality from external causes ranges from over 200 deaths per 100 000 population in some NIS to about 30 per 100 000 in the United Kingdom. A relatively high mortality rate is also observed in Finland, mainly because of high numbers of suicides.<P>


<a name="t05"><H2>Communicable diseases: </A><BR>
no room for complacency</H2>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P05">Health for all, target 5</A></h4>



The latest reports from a number of countries prove that communicable diseases unfortunately remain major health problems in the Region. Without considering the AIDS epidemic, the resurgence of highly contagious diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria and cholera alarms health authorities in many Member States.<P>
Dying from diphtheria or cholera in Europe in the 1990s seems very improbable. It is a fact, however, and disease could easily spread to the areas with armed conflict, large numbers of refugees or grave economic problems, if public health authorities remain complacent.<P>
In general, immunization coverage remains high and stable in the Region. Recent experience has shown that this is not sufficient to eliminate measles, for example. Protection against pertussis has been insufficient in a number of countries, particularly the NIS. In addition, low coverage of immunization with DPT/DT vaccines in many regions of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine is one of the main causes of the diphtheria epidemic in these countries.<P>
The global goal of a 95% reduction in measles mortality was achieved, although the eradication of the disease is no longer considered a realistic
goal. The reduction in morbidity is estimated to be 81-98%. Owing to a shortage of vaccines in some NIS, the pace of progress towards eradicating poliomyelitis has slowed, but reasonable prospects remain for reaching the goal by the year 2000. Although poliomyelitis occurred in fewer countries in 1993, the actual number of cases rose (Fig. 2.8). The diphtheria situation deteriorated in 1990 and worsened dramatically in 1992 and 1993. Almost all cases were reported from the NIS. The Russian Federation and Ukraine saw most of the sharp rise in incidence in the early 1990s (Fig. 2.9). National action plans for diphtheria control, based on Regional Office recommendations, have been carried out in Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.<P>

In some countries, tuberculosis morbidity has stopped declining in recent years or even increased; this is partly attributable to immigration in western countries. During the 1980s, notified tuberculosis cases declined almost everywhere in the Region. Since 1988, 13 countries have stopped vaccination with BCG vaccine. Tuberculosis notification has levelled off or increased in recent years in many CCEE and NIS. It has also increased in western countries: Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. With the present trend of mass migration, an increasing number of refugees, and the critical socioeconomic situation in many countries, transmission is very likely to increase.<P>
The resurgence of cholera has become another concern. For example, 165 cholera cases were registered in Tajikistan in 1993, and a large outbreak occurred in Dagestan, Russian Federation in 1994. Imported cases from endemic areas outside the Region endangers countries in which sewage and sanitation are still poor.<P>
By August 1994, a cumulative total of 116 000 AIDS cases had been reported in the countries of the European Region. The annual incidence shows signs of slowing down, refiecting the effect of the tremendous preventive efforts undertaken by Member States since the epidemic began. Fig. 2.10 shows increases in cases transmitted by injecting drug use and heterosexual contact.<P>

Mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases varies from 4050 per 100 000 population in the central Asian republics to 510 in western countries, but continues to decrease in most countries of the Region. A slight increase was observed in the NIS in 1990-1993. For example, mortality in 1992/1993 in Lithuania, the Russian Federation and Ukraine has reached the levels observed in the first half of the 1980s. Some increase since the early and mid-1980s has taken place in Denmark, the Netherlands, Romania and Switzerland.<P>


<a name="t08"><H2>Investing in women's health: </A><BR>
unacceptable family and social loss from high maternal mortality in some areas</H2>


<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P08">Health for all, target 8</A></h4>

An assessment of women's health in the European Region, based on selected regional health for all indicators, confirms that women live longer than men: on average, 57 years more in western Europe and about 713 years more in eastern countries. The higher mortality rates of men often draw attention away from the health problems that women face. Women's health has a strong influence on the health of the children they bear and raise. Although women care for the young and often the old, their health and social status are usually worse than those of men. Improving women's health will therefore affect family health in general.<P>
Women have more years of unhealthy life (higher rates of chronic illness and disability), associated to a great extent with their longer survival.<P>
In total, 10 NIS and 1 of the CCEE have maternal mortality rates above 30 per 100 000 live births.<P>
Abortion-related mortality, on average, is responsible for about 2025% of maternal deaths in the CCEE and NIS. This must be regarded as an unacceptably high family and social loss that needs emergency attention.<P>
Abortion remains the principal means of contraception in the CCEE and NIS; countries may have two or three times as many abortions as births. In the western part of the Region, most teenage pregnancies are unwanted, and about one third end in abortion in some countries. In many countries, lack of sex education for the whole population denies people an informed choice; in women, such ignorance endangers their security and causes them bodily harm.<P>
In addition to health problems related to maternity, women have other unique health problems related mainly to reproductive functions and the menopause. The rates of cervical cancer mortality in CCEE are double the average for the Region, and about three times the EU average. The highest mortality rates from cancer of the breast, however, are found in the western part of the Region.<P>
It is feared that the concerted targeting of young people, particularly young women, in tobacco advertising will lead to more smoking among women. Increases in female lung cancer mortality in a number of countries illustrates the danger (Fig. 2.11). Some western European countries are trying to ban cigarette advertising in magazines for young women.<P>

The numbers of prostitutes and other sex workers are increasing rapidly in the Region, and the proportion of AIDS cases in females continues to increase.<P>
Western countries have identified mental and emotional health as a priority issue. Women are more likely than men to suffer from depression and anxiety, and to be prescribed tranquillizers. Addiction to tranquillizers is becoming a problem.<P>
Finally, women's economic situation is in general less favourable than that of men, which has important implications for health.<P>

Western countries reported some signs of improvement in the health of elderly people. Some countries calculate disability-free life expectancy, based on data from health interview surveys; France, for example, reported a marked increase in disabilityfree life, both in absolute terms and in relation to overall life expectancy.<P>
The health and quality of life of the elderly tend to be low priorities in the government policies of most countries of the Region. The situation is particularly bad in the CCEE and NIS, where elderly people, especially those living alone, were the first to suffer from the consequences of the economic crisis. The huge inflation rates of recent years in the NIS have virtually wiped out all the savings the elderly had accumulated. State pensions are too low to pay the increasing prices of housing, heating and food. In addition, the economic crisis affected the institutions for the elderlv funded by the state. International aid was important in helping to meet the basic needs of residents of homes for the elderly.<P>

Many chronic conditions, and particularly their complications, create a major burden of disability and reduced quality of life. Two examples are diabetes and oral health.<P>
The prevalence of diabetes varies between 1% and 4% of the general population in different countries of the Region. The prevalence of complications also varies, but still tends to be high in most countries. For example, a WHO study of vascular disease in diabetic patients in various European study centres indicates that the true prevalence of this severe complication may vary from about 15% to over 40% in males and from about 20% to some 50% in females. More recent studies showed that the prevalence of retinopathy in patients treated with insulin is probably in the range of 4060%. In Lithuania, for example, more than 90% of all insulin-dependent diabetes patients eventually develop retinopathy and about half of these develop proliferative changes threatening their vision. The complication rates are probably slightly higher in Lithuania than in Sweden or Denmark, at least with respect to retinopathy, but are likely to reflect the situation in many countries of the Region. The important fact, however, is that some areas and countries, such as Iceland, have been able to demonstrate very low complication rates.<P>
For this reason, several initiatives were recently launched to reduce the burden of such conditions in the Region. These initiatives are based on the simple principle of sharing information on performance and the best care practices between care providers, hospitals or countries, to encourage and motivate action for improvement. As a result of these initiatives, there is already clear evidence that diabetic complications have fallen in a number of countries, including Croatia and Norway (Fig. 2.12).<P>

ln addition, standardized quality indicators in use at the clinical, regional, national and international levels are increasingly accepted as the basis for further quality development in oral health. Sharing information on these indicators as well as on the best technical solutions or practices has already helped significantly to improve oral health in a number of countries, particularly Denmark.<P>

Mental health and wellbeing could be considered a continuum ranging from severe psychiatric conditions to complete satisfaction with the perceived state of health and quality of life, with disorders, distress and psychological problems of varying severity Iying in between. At least 5% of the population of the Region is estimated to suffer from serious, diagnosable mental disorders (neuroses and functional psychoses), although prevalence estimates vary widely from study to study. At least an additional 15% of the population is estimated to suffer less severe, but potentially incapacitating, forms of mental distress.<P>
As to perceived health, this indicator is closely related to objective health and living conditions, and is a strong predictor of health problems and mortality. Data collected for this report show large and striking differences between countries that need to be better understood (Fig. 2.13) . It is known that the absence of diagnosed disease is not a guarantee of good perceived health, and that many people with chronic conditions nevertheless feel healthy, if they are appropriately treated. This discrepancy, and probably many of the differences between otherwise comparable countries, reflect different cultural attitudes towards health and giving personal judgements.<P>

Mental health and wellbeing became an increasing problem in the Region, mainly as a result of war-related trauma, economic crisis, social deprivation and migration. The unusually rapid and extensive change in social, political and economic structures contributed to the increase in the number of people affected by depression, anxiety and personality adjustment problems. Such conditions always affect the quality of life, but their impact was most likely to increase where adequate care and support structures were missing.<P>
Further, rates of suicides among young people are on the increase in many Member States and the consumption of tranquillizers and antidepressants is large and growing, as shown by recent studies in countries such as Finland and Spain. Rates of homicide and purposeful injury are on the increase in almost all Member States. The Regional Office study on parasuicide provided the first estimates of such behaviour in 13 countries. Although trends are not yet clear, the study shows a higher risk of parasuicide among the unemployed, for example.<P>
Another increasingly used measure is healthy life expectancy. This is a generic term for indicators of the average duration of different states of health within the life-span, which is calculated by lifetable methods. Several calculations have been made for dementia-free life expectancy, for example. Calculations for France showed a difference of just under a year between life expectancy and dementia-free life expectancy, which remains constant at all ages after 65 years. Dementia-free life expectancy is predicted to continue to increase in absolute terms, although it will fall slightly as a proportion of the overall life expectancy. This assessment is likely to be applicable to other countries with comparable mortality patterns.<P>
In addition, a large proportion of people with severe mental disorders continued to be placed in institutions, which indicates a lack of appropriate care and rehabilitation. Nevertheless, some western European countries showed a decreasing use of long-term psychiatric hospital care and improved community-based care and treatment facilities. Since 1985, the number of beds for psychiatric care declined by about one half in Denmark and Finland, one third in Sweden and one fifth in the United Kingdom.<P>
Awareness of and interest in improving the quality of life for physically and mentally disabled people are growing, although only in certain areas. Increasisng difficulty in finding appropriate work for physically and mentally disabled people has been reported, mainly owing to economic conditions.<P>

<H2>Achievement of quantitative targets</H2>



The objective of monitoring progress towards health for all is to assess the level of achievement of the 38 targets for the European Region. A look at the achievement profile of the Region reveals a clear dichotomy. In general, target achievement is far better in western Europe than in the eastern countries of the Region. Table 2.2 describes the level of achievement for the targets that lend themselves to precise quantitative assessment.<P>

<H3>Health for all policy gaining in influence
throughout the Region</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P33">Health for all, target 33</A></h4>



For decades, health seemed a relatively isolated and undisturbed field. Today it is
perhaps the sector most affected by the current political and economic crises. Health
has become a favourite theme of the mass media and public opinion, and is therefore
at the centre of political debates that influence the choice of policies. The outcomes
of these debates are translated into the important reforms of policy and health
systems that are under development in most countries of the European Region.<P>
The severe financial constraints on all Member States have reinforced the need to set
priorities. In response to the prevailing market-oriented climate, many western
European countries, such as Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway and the United Kingdom, have undertaken health reforms in recent years.
The development of an overall public health policy has often accompanied the
implementation of reforms. This offers new opportunities to reorient health services
towards primary care, and to focus on health promotion and disease prevention.
Some western countries that resisted or did not see the relevance of developing
health policies at the national level have recently started to work towards them.<P>
With the legacy of a centralized approach to health policy and health services
management, all the CCEE and NIS focus their health reforms on systems of care:
primary health care, hospital care, personnel and the quality of care. Frequently the
reforms are even broader, encompassing the whole field of health: disease
prevention, health promotion and the environment and health. This is the case in, for
example, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, the Russian Federation and
Ukraine.<P>
From east to west, health policy and health care system reforms often refer to the
regional policy for health for all, particularly when the reforms take an intersectoral
and comprehensive approach. In the CCEE and NIS, new policies are being
formulated, based on health for all but tailored more closely to local
circumstances.<P>
In recent years, many countries have elaborated national health policy documents to
stimulate public debate and to secure ratification of the policies by their parliaments.
The Regional Office has made critical comments on documents prepared for
example, in Croatia, France <I>(Strategie pour une politique de sante),
</I>Luxembourg, Turkey and the United Kingdom (England - <I>The health of the
nation). </I>In addition, the Regional Office made an external review of Finland's
national policy for health for all. A meeting held in late 1992 to consider the value of
the review recognized that it had had a strong impact on health policy development
in Finland.<P>
Approaches on a regional level are increasingly developed in Member States with
centralized health systems, as well as in those with a federal structure. For the first
group of countries, the United Kingdom has set an example of how to translate a
national policy based on health for all into action by creating "task forces" and
"alliances for health" at the community level. In countries with a strong federal
structure, such as Switzerland, the process of policy development started with the
coordination of activities such as collecting data and reporting on health, or sharing
know-how and resources within coalitions tackling particular tasks. In addition, the
autonomous regions in Spain are implementing policies based on health for all.<P>
At the international level, members of the United Nations family, particularly the
United Nations Childrenls Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, have entered the
field of health development in the Region, while European organizations such as the
EU, the Council of Europe (CE) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development have expanded considerably. The EU's mandate in the field of health
policy, until now very limited, has been enlarged, notably through Article 129 of the
Treaty on European Union (often called the Maastricht Treaty).<P>
Despite the efforts of some international organizations, including WHO,
coordinating international development has been difficult. This decreases the
efficiency of international aid. The situation seems to be improving, although only
two organizations active in the Region, the CE and the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, have adopted health for all as a basis for
health policies.<P>




<a name="t01"><a name="t38"><H3>Equity also an ethical issue</A></a></H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P01">Health for all, target 1</A></h4>


<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P38">Health for all, target 38</A></h4>


Equity is an underlying principle of the philosophy of health for all, which all
Member States have endorsed. Variations in mortality and morbidity rates between
and within countries, however, seem to have grown in recent years. There is
evidence of widening gaps in health-related behaviour, access to care and health
service utilization, quality of care and, most important, access to the prerequisites for
health.<P>
As already mentioned, the economic recession has led to poverty, unemployment and
homelessness for increasing numbers of people in many countries. In some countries,
the restriction of public spending has led to a reduction in the health and support
services provided. This seems to have affected people of lower socioeconomic status
more than others. Countries can and must do much: to improve their information
systems in order to reflect inequities in health, to formulate and implement
intersectoral policies to promote equity in health, and to safeguard vulnerable groups
in the present climate of cost constraint.<P>
The health gap between east and west demands urgent measures. It is essential that
Member States, along with WHO, make a very determined effort to reduce
inequities, if the targets for health for all are to be achieved.<P>
<H2>Foundations of public health
action</H2>
<a name="t34"><H3>Emergence and strengthening of a new
model for public health action</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P34">Health for all, target 34</A></h4>



Since the mid-1980s, the European strategy for health for all has been the key
vehicle for the emergence of a new model for public health action that synthesizes
individual responsibilities and rights and purposeful community action. It has
bridged old divisions between disciplines and brought together, into a common
public health framework, social and political scientists, epidemiologists, biomedical
scientists and health care practitioners, health managers and economists. The
emphasis on a broad social commitment to explicit health targets has provided a
sense of cohesion. The focus on effectiveness in public health action, as well as its
requirement for monitoring and evaluating progress towards targets, is profoundly
changing public health thinking.<P>
In the early 1 990s, this action model gained strength throughout and even beyond
the Region. National policies, the Regions for Health Network, and the expanding
Healthy Cities and Healthy Schools movements are being inspired by this model.
Community-based initiatives to prevent and control disease have been moving
beyond mere biomedical intervention programmes. The stronger emphasis on health
effectiveness and outcomes of health care is influencing health care reforms and
work to improve the quality of care.<P>
One of the most significant effects of the model has been the emergence of many
different forms of health partnership. Those of particular importance bring public
and economic interests closer together- in the food industry and commerce, the
pharmaceutical industry, tourism and recreational industries, or the information and
telecommunication industries. These partnerships have heightened the capacity of
public health to cooperate with industry. They have also shown that attempts by
some economic interests to discard or discredit solid scientific evidence are a less
useful course of action than open cooperation.<P>
The current international debate on population and environment issues, the UNDP
agenda on human development, the UNICEF approach to children's wellbeing and
the World Bank's recent report on investing in health have all reinforced this public
health renaissance. The European Commission's framework for public health action,
which addresses some important aspects of public health development in Europe, is
also of great significance.<P>
<a name="t32"><H3>Public health research: a pending
upgrade</A></H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P32">Health for all, target 32</A></h4>



Most countries still do not have a national policy on public health research. Such
research remains centred on traditional public health disciplines such as
epidemiology and individual risk factor models. It has not been sufficiently
reoriented towards emerging priority areas such as economic evaluation and quality
assurance. Public health research needs to extend beyond assessing the population's
health needs to supporting the efficacy of health intervention.<P>
The most important need is for a new type of alliance between policy-makers and the
research community. An effective strategy demands that policymakers and
researchers help each other to fulfil their complementary roles. The central question
for public health research is how to be relevant to the policy process; this is the
major concern of health systems research.<P>
Competent people in health systems research are scarce, especially in the CCEE and
NIS. These countries have no trained generation of younger researchers in social
sciences. In the rest of the Region, too, there are not enough qualified researchers in
health systems and related areas. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, a
research and development strategy is being built into the overall health strategy, to
bring together the existing research so that it influences policy, including identifying
where dis-investment is necessary.<P>
The EU research programme BIOMED is moving towards developing a more
strategic approach to public health and health systems research, particularly through
the establishment of an advisory committee in 1994.<P>
<a name="t35"><H3>Health information: who is becoming
healthier, and why?</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P35">Health for all, target 35</A></h4>



The explosive development of information and telecommunication technology has
reached the health sector through the rapid expansion of information networks such
as the Internet or the development of more health-specific information networks such
as ENS/CARE. The latter was developed by WHO, the European Commission and
their partners.<P>
While the information products available to potential users (such as publications,
databases and presentation tools) have considerably improved and diversified, the
content and quality of the data collected remain basically unchanged. The main
driving force for changing information systems appears to be information-related
industries. Thus, technological innovations have more influence than new concepts
on developments in the type and structure of information that is needed for public
health policy and action. The users of information systems and their products are
insufficiently involved in developing these systems.<P>
Reforms in health services have created a greater demand for information support.
Unfortunately, the lack of information is a bigger stumbling block than ever. The
most striking examples of this are:<P>

<ul>

<li>the continuing failure to report on inequities in health;
<li>the inability to describe the real costs of health services;
<li>the difficulty in agreeing on the common standards needed for international
comparisons;
<li>a lack of explicit links between health care expenditure and health gain 
achieved.
</UL>



The Region continually confronts the contrast between the rapid growth of
knowledge in clinical medicine and health-related industries, and the paucity of
information on who becomes more healthy, and who becomes less healthy, and
why.<P>
In the CCEE and NIS, information systems are in the midst of a crisis of transition.
The decentralization and the redistribution of power have left central administrations
with little capacity to support traditional information systems, which focus on health
facilities and their activities. In addition, several factors exacerbate the shortcomings
of the established information structures in the health sector. These factors include:
limited resources to modernize equipment, the move of trained personnel to the
private sector, a lack of adequate enforcement of (mostly outdated) reporting
regulations and, perhaps most important, the lack of a clear vision of the future of the
health system.<P>
Throughout the Region, ownership of and access to public health information is a
major problem. While ensuring that the health of the population is analysed
according to the best scientific standards is obviously in the public interest, users of
public health data are frequently discouraged when they seek access to such
information.<P>
On the positive side, the profound changes in the socioeconomic environment and
the effort to adapt to the new realities in the Region provide unique opportunities for
gradually arriving at a more flexible, socially effective and user-friendlv information
culture. The experience accumulated in developing the international database of
health for all indicators provides a model of the kind of political process that is
necessary if all parties are seriously to use information as a tool for health
development.<P>
<a name="t36"><H3>Developing schools for the new public
health</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P36">Health for all, target 36</A></h4>



Despite the new roles that public health professionals are expected to play, training
in public health has not substantially changed in the Region. Nevertheless, some
initiatives are underway in most Member States. In a few countries, such as Germany
and Spain, new schools of public health have been established that have adopted the
principles of health for all as a base for learning. Nevertheless, most developments
have taken the form of new programmes, such as those on health economics, health
education and health promotion, which have been added to the existing ones. While
the new programmes are welcome, they reflect a continuation of the trend towards
hyperspecialization.<P>
Most postgraduate training programmes focus on a single discipline and often on a
single type of professional. Public health training programmes are as numerous as
professional careers in public health. This is a major constraint on building up the
interdisciplinary policy-making and planning that are inherent in the strategy for
health for all. The European strategy for health for all notes that:<P>
The overall result of existing training policies and methods has been an
overemphasis on producing specialists with very specific competences and skills,
rather than generalists with broad vision who are capable of integrating their own
work with that of others, both within and outside the health sector.<P>
The persistence of the split between the traditional hygiene role of public health and
the roles of<P>
management of services, and especially of hospital services, is the most difficult
feature of the current situation. Most of the renewed interest in management in the
health sector remains narrowly focused on hospitals. The challenge is to develop
competences in management for health. Otherwise, there is a risk of producing a
generation of hospital managers who do even b'etter what they should not do at
all.<P>
What is needed is a common core curriculum or track for all public health students.
This would provide them with a common understanding of the new public health and
a focus on the health of populations and a global model of health and health gain.
This common track (perhaps the core of a European degree of Master of Public
Health) is the sort of public health training needed to systematize the philosophy of
public health behind the strategy of health for all.<P>
In close collaboration with the Regional Office, the Association of Schools of Public
Health of the European Region (ASPHER) has contributed to the development of the
new schools and programmes.<P>

Policies, structures and programmes to address broad lifestyles issues are being implemented at the national, regional and local levels in a number of Member States. Health promotion continues to be rather narrowly focused on issues such as smoking, drugs and HIV and AIDS. Financial constraints remain the major obstacle to modernizing health promotion infrastructures. A significant development in such modernization, however, is the fast growth of the WHO Healthy Cities and Healthy Schools projects. The former includes 33 cities and 20 national and several regional networks involving more than 600 cities and towns throughout the European Region. The project is expanding to an increasing number of the CCEE and NIS.<P>
With the economic recession, many Member States have to deal with the adverse effects on lifestyles of chronic unemployment and job insecurity. Powerful economic changes are having profound effects on the quality of life of large groups in the Region.<P>
A considerable part of the Region's population still faces obstacles to adopting healthy lifestyles. Changing one's lifestyle is often not economically feasible, in either the western or eastern countries. In some parts of the Region, people are exposed to environmental hazards beyond their control.<P>
In many countries, however, a positive trend is emerging. The public is requiring governments to enact health promoting legislation on smoking, food labelling and the removal of lead from fuel, for example. In several Member States, government and nongovernmental and voluntary organizations increasingly take action to strengthen the national and local infrastructures for health promotion. This is the direction to go in order to implement the principles of health for all. Time will be needed to break the habit of community passivity and to establish a sense of community ownership of health, including an appreciation of the rights, obligations and opportunities connected with health.<P>
Despite the great diversity in delivery systems for health care and health promotion in the Region, most are undergoing some kind of reform. Most current reforms are restricted to issues in the financing and provision of medical services. Only very few Member States are introducing reforms that are firmly based on the type of policies needed to create lifestyles conducive to health.<P>
<a name="t17"><H3>Call for tougher tobacco policies</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P17">Health for all, target 17</A></h4>



Success in reducing the prevalence of smoking has been mixed (Fig. 4.1). While the number of cigarettes smoked has risen, the number of adults who smoke has fallen steadily in all parts of the Region. As this trend has largely applied to moderate male smokers, the improvement hides a worsening situation among females, particularly in the CCEE and NIS. The WHO survey on the health behaviour of schoolchildren revealed increasing levels of weekly smoking, most notably among girls (Fig. 4.2).<P>
<B>See:</b> <a href="fig41.gif">Fig.4.1 Estimates of smoking prevalence in the European Region, early 1990s</A> <p>
Source: data from the WHO Regional Office for Europe.<p>
<B>See:</B> <a href="fig42.gif">Fig. 4.2 Regular smoking among girls aged 11, 13 and 15 years, 1990</A><p>
Source: Kannas et al.<p>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The total number of deaths attributable to smoking is still rising in the Region, and is predicted to reach 1.4 million by 1995. These deaths increasingly affect people of middle age. For instance, tobacco will kill every second Polish man who dies between the ages of 35 and 59.<P>
In recent years, concern has increased about the activities of the tobacco industry, particularly in the CCEE and NIS. The western tobacco industry has invested to take advantage of the considerable opportunities to increase their market share, especially among women. These countries have witnessed aggressive blanket advertising to often inexperienced audiences. Foreign investment in purchasing and building factories, and introducing new technology will undoubtedly lead to a supply of products more attractive to women and young people.<P>
Although national strategies against smoking have proven effective in diminishing lung cancer mortality in Finland and the United Kingdom, the political commitment to setting up national plans for tobacco control and the funding required to implement them are usually low, especially in the CCEE and NIS. In contrast, studies show that public opinion favours tobacco control policy measures such as banning tobacco advertising. Since 1987, about 20 countries have adopted new legislation or programmes for tobacco control; the countries acting between 1990 and 1994 included France, Hungary, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Many countries still seem to overlook the importance of price policies, although the experience of countries such as Sweden clearly demonstrates that a sharp increase in tobacco taxes, accompanied by broad information campaigns, results in substantial drops in sales.<P>
<H3>Drinking: some progress but for how much longer?</H3>
Alcohol consumption has fallen noticeably in southern Europe, where overall consumption was previously high (Fig. 4.3). In northern Europe, with its markedly lower consumption levels, the situation is stable, while alcohol consumption has risen in the CCEE and NIS.<P>
<P><B>See:</B> <a href="fig43.gif">Fig. 4.3 Annual pure alcohol consumption in selected countries, from 1980 to the latest available year</A><p>

Young people's drinking behaviour is a cause for concern because of a widespread increase in consumption, particularly of beer. Girls' drinking is changing faster than boys'. This pattern is also seen in women, who show a trend towards in creasing consumption. The economic recession throughout western Europe is likely to have reduced consumption, although it was falling in some areas even before the recession occurred. When this eases, however, consumption may rise as a result of increases in disposable income.<P>
Indicators of alcohol-related disease show a similar picture: a decline in southern countries, and little change in northern ones. Evidence suggests a worsening pattern in the CCEE and NIS in recent years, however, following some improvements in the former USSR during the 1984/1985 campaign to control alcohol.<P>
Interest seems to be increasing in a public health approach to alcohol control. Most of the CCEE and NIS are preparing new alcohol legislation. Action is particularly noticeable in southern Europe, where alcohol policies had been weaker. France, for example, has introduced a new law on advertising, and strong regional public health initiatives have been taken in Italy and Spain. Italy is the first country to achieve a 25% reduction from the 1980 consumption level. France and Spain also have a good chance of reaching this target if present trends continue. Nevertheless, policies differ widely between countries, as do their enforcement and implementation.<P>
<H3>Psychoactive drugs: the rising tide</H3>
The use of psychoactive drugs has almost certainly increased throughout the Region, but monitoring trends is difficult owing to the lack of reliable and comprehensive information. Young people have been experimenting more than previously. The use of so-called hard drugs, as well as of soft drugs, seems very likely to have risen, particularly in the CCEE and NIS, but also in western countries. This is apparent from the increasing rates of drugrelated deaths in countries with effective monitoring systems, such as Germany.<P>
On the positive side, virtually all countries have mounted action programmes. Some changed their strategy, giving priority to reducing demand rather than supply. Harm reduction schemes involving syringe and needle exchange are widespread. Progressive changes in the practices of treatment services have occurred, including greater use of substitution therapy (with methadone). The public health perspective in dealing with drug problems is now widely accepted and political commitment has been high, as expressed by the pan-European conference of ministers on rehabilitation and drug policy in 1993. Intersectoral collaboration has been considerable, and included high levels of community participation.<P>

Nevertheless, the situation is likely to continue to worsen. In part, this will be due to an increasing supply of drugs from the CCEE and NIS, as well as Asia, where there are real economic incentives to produce. Growing marijuana or opium poppies as a cash crop can be very profitable. There is a great danger of increased trafficking from the east to the west of the Region. In addition, the demand for drugs is likely to increase in the CCEE and NIS as the influence of western lifestyles grows.<P>
The imbalance between the action taken and the return required is leading some countries to reassess their strategies. In Germany, for example, more emphasis is placed on the treatment of drugdependent people than on punishment. Further, many opportunities to integrate work on drugs with that on other public health issues seem to have been missed. Programmes tend to be vertical, with little integration with those on such issues as tobacco, alcohol and especially HIV and AIDS.<P>

Except in countries with armed confiict, the European Region does not face severe malnutrition or suffer from shortages of food. Shortages and economic difficulties, however, prevent many people from eating healthy diets, especially in certain areas of the CCEE and NIS. The problem is more pronounced for women because of the effect of the mother's poor diet on children. In 1990, the prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women aged 25-49 years in the Region was estimated to be 17%. At the same time, a high proportion of the population in most countries is overweight or obese, and this proportion may be rising (Fig. 4.4). The imbalance in the nutritional value of the diets consumed contributes to the high levels of, for example, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.<P>
<P><B>See: </B><a href="fig44.gif">Fig. 4.4 Body mass index (BMI) - percentage of people in selected countries who are overweight (BMI 27-29) or obese (BMI >29), by sex </A><p>
Source: data from the WHO Regional Office for Europe.<p>



In recent years, a regional nutritional pattern has become more visible. In the north, diet-related health is improving. In the south, diet has always been better than in the rest of the Region and this remains the case on the whole. In the east, the situation is worsening: the consumption of cereals and potatoes has declined, while high levels of animal fat are still consumed. Positive elements, however, include the increased intake of fruit and vegetables. The information available provides good evidence that dietary behaviour can change over quite a short period.<P>
Political interest in food and nutrition issues has become stronger, and awareness and activism have increased in national nutrition groups, as well as consumers and the groups that represent them. In addition, the food industry has started doing business on the basis of healthy eating, using marketing and advertising strategies that lay much more stress on the social meaning of food and on nutritional behaviour.<P>
Nevertheless, health campaigns and education programmes, whether on nutrition, sensible drinking or tobacco use, rarely address some important aspects of lifestyle. In a way, health as a behavioural outcome is competing with more immediate "effects" such as self-expression, self-presentation and self-gratification. These are fairly strong determinants of behaviour and potential motivators for change, and should therefore be targeted in health promotion.<P>
<H3>Making physical exercise more attractive</H3>
Despite the well documented benefits of physical activity for physical and mental wellbeing, only few countries of the Region monitor levels of physical activity, and explicit policies on exercise and health do not yet have great prominence. Western Europeans, especially children, spend a ridiculously low amount of time in sporting activities, in comparison with that spent watching television (Fig. 4.5). In the CCEE and NIS, adult levels of physical activity may be somewhat higher, mainly owing to more frequent manual work, but this situation is likely to change.<P>



<b>See:</B> <a href="fig45.gif">Fig. 4.5 Percentage of children aged 13 years who watch television more than four hours per day, by sex, 1990</A><p>

Intensified public health action is therefore needed throughout the Region to prevent an aggravation of the situation. To this end, alliances may be formed with sports associations, clubs and other organizations to carry out activities that are attractive and immediately beneficial. Special efforts should be made to analyse more thoroughly the potential for contributions by other policy areas, and innovative action should be pursued for women, older people and children.<P>


<H3>Sexual health: a continued concern</H3>
Political commitment to the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and unwanted pregnancies has increased over the past decade.<P>
Complacency remains, however, along with the risk of losing the gains made. In spite of continued improvements in preventive approaches and the delivery of services (such as counselling), most people with risk behaviour still do not practise safe sex.<P>
The danger of HIV transmission makes this situation particularly worrying. The incidence of HIV infection is still increasing among intravenous drug users, as well as among heterosexuals and men who have sex with men. Women are at increasing risk. Member States reported a cumulative total of 116 000 AIDS cases by August 1994. It is estimated that 500 000 people in the Region have been infected with HIV. Trends in the incidence of AIDS, however, merely reflect the situation of HIV infection some 10-13 years ago.<P>
Several countries have made progress in developing public policy and strong intersectoral action. Other countries, however, show evidence of a weakening response and reduced funding. In general, the prevention of HIV has not been closely coordinated with that of sexually transmitted diseases, or with programmes on family planning or the prevention of intravenous drug use.<P>
Improvements seem to have occurred in legislation and in the attitudes of the general public towards different sexual orientations and practices (such as homosexuality), particularly in the CCEE and NIS. This is an important prerequisite for the implementation of comprehensive prevention programmes. Sharply increasing numbers of"traditional" sexually transmitted diseases in some of the eastern countries highlight the need for such programmes.<P>

<H3>Agreement on policy: time to act</H3>
The results of the First European Conference on Environment and Health, held in 1989, included the European Charter on Environment and Health. Many countries followed up the most important decisions of the Conference, and several based their policies on health and the environment on the principles laid down in the European Charter. Countries across the Region have made new laws and new or stricter standards for the quality of the environment. The field of environment and health has received new emphasis in the policies of most Member States.<P>
Growing public awareness has played a specific role in these achievements. Economic recession and armed conflict, however, have had serious effects on developments in the environment and health in the whole Region.<P>

According to a WHO survey on environmental health management, most Member States devote much of their infrastructure and human resources to control activities. In contrast, prevention, the response to emergencies and the assessment of the impact of environmental hazards on human health suffer from shortages. In addition, very little information is available about the application, and comparative efficiency and effectiveness of different tools and instruments developed for environmental control.<P>
Despite considerable investment in collecting environmental data and in monitoring by many European countries, comparable data for assessing the status or effects of environmental conditions on human health and wellbeing are scarce (Table 4.1). The WHO European Centre for Environment and Health carried out a comprehensive anaIysis of the state of the environment and health in the European Region. The resulting report, <I>Concern for Europe's Tomorrow, </I>was presented to the Second European Conference on Environment and Health, held in Helsinki in June 1994. It yielded background information for preparation of the Environment and Health Action Plan for Europe.<P>
<P><B>See: <a href="table41.htm">Table 4.1 Estimated exposure of the general population to selected environmental risk factors and their potential health effects.</A></B>
<P>
<P>
The main task of Member States is now to implement the Action Plan adopted by ministers of the environment and of health in Helsinki. Individual countries have to set priorities in environmental health, but action on these priorities requires support from the international community. As part of the necessary machinery, a European Environment and Health Committee will be established with effect from 1 January 1995, with support from the Regional Office.<P>
<a name="t20"><H3>Safe drinking-water and proper sanitation still lacking for over 100 million people</H3>


<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P20">Health for all, target 20</A></h4>


About 12% of the population of the European Region, mainly in the eastern countries, still lacks access to safe drinking-water. Even more people are not served by adequate sewage treatment facilities. Waterborne infections are a major problem, particularly in the CCEE and NIS. The incidence of typhoid, cholera and hepatitis A, and the rising incidence of gastrointestinal and parasitic diseases, particularly in the central Asian republics and the Russian Federation, are causes for extreme concern. They also indicate the need for basic sanitation systems as a top priority in many countries.<P>
Waste disposal sites and increasing pollution threaten substantial proportions of drinking-water resources. Other problems to be addressed include difficulties in providing reliable water supplies, and inadequacies in water treatment and the maintenance of distribution systems.<P>
Finally, armed conflict has resulted in the destruction and disruption of water supplies and other essential environmental health services, threatening the health of entire communities.<P>
<a name="t21"><H3>Air quality improved in the west, often unacceptable in the east</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P21">Health for all, target 21</A></h4>



Progress has been made in all parts of the Region, and particularly in western countries, in reducing pollution with sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and lead from stationary sources. About one third of the Region's population, however, still lives in urban areas where pollution levels continue to exceed the WHO air quality guidelines. Most of these areas are found in the CCEE and NIS.<P>
In addition, the rapid expansion of road traffic in most parts of the Region is increasing air pollution from nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter from both diesel and petrol emissions. Pollution with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds leads to the formation of ozone and the creation of summer-type smogs In many cltles of southern and western Europe.<P>
Air pollution, whether indoors or outdoors, helps to increase ill health, including allergic reactions. Lead emissions from industry and road transport increase the lead burden on children in source areas. Reducing levels of these and other pollutants requires much greater effort to implement comprehensive approaches and strategles.<P>
<a name="t22"><H3>Food: </A>limited progress and marked increase of microbial diseases</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P22">Health for all, target 22</A></h4>


Microbial diseases due to contaminated food have increased markedly in recent years throughout the Region, with the ensuing costs estimated at several billion US dollars per year. Perhaps as many as 130 million people, 15% of the population in the Region, suffer each year from gastrointestinal symptoms of foodborne or waterborne infectious diseases. These diseases are mainly due to <I>Salmonella </I>and <I>Campylobacter </I>spp.<P>
Many of the problems arise during the primary production of food, but more attention needs to be paid to the storage and distribution phases, as well. Centralized food production may increase the likelihood of the wide dissemination of contaminated food.<P>
<a name="t23"><H3>Waste and soil pollution: production and consumption patterns must change</A></H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P23">Health for all, target 23</A></h4>


While some countries have made good progress in separating municipal waste, and in reducing and recycling waste, others lack adequate arrangements. In certain areas, such as those close to metallurgic plants or highways, the sedimentation of air pollutants leads to soil pollution. Moreover, inappropriate waste disposal over decades (from industrial and military activities, for example) has created many "problem sites" throughout the Region. These sites pose many potential environmental health hazards.<P>
Further, Member States have a common major problem in the uncontrolled growth in waste production. Nearly half the countries of the Region, including those at war and most of the CCEE and NIS, show little or negative development in practices for managing waste and soil pollution.<P>
<a name="t24"><H3>Housing situation worsens in urban areas</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P24">Health for all, target 24</A></h4>





The major health risks related to housing remain the lack of safe water supply and sanitation, poor indoor air quality and climate, and construction deficiencies that encourage accidents. In urban areas, problems have worsened in the past few years with hygiene factors, crowding and homelessness, at least partly due to increased migration. Other problems, such as unemployment, loneliness and the weakening of supportive social networks resulting from changes in the social structure, have not yet been adequately addressed. Levels of deprivation and squalor are already unacceptable in many places.<P>
Housing is associated with about 60 000 deaths and around 50 million cases of injury and disability that are treated in clinics each year. About 15-25% of the population of industrialized countries is exposed to levels of noise that cause serious nuisance.<P>
As to ionizing radiation, background radiation contributes most to average human exposure. Background radiation may increase, however, in areas with high amounts of radon. Under routine operating conditions, nuclear power production contributes smaller doses than background radiation, but the safety of certain types of nuclear reactors needs urgent improvement.<P>
<a name="t25"><H3>Health at work: huge potential for improvement</H3>


<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P25">Health for all, target 25</A></h4>


The health impact of exposure to hazards at work remains a cause of great concern. The situation in occupational health varies widely, according to many complex factors such as economic recession, the transition to a market economy, and structures for environmental health and other services.<P>
About 50% of the Region's workforce is estimated to be without access to occupational health services. The main shortcomings are found in smallscale industries, and particularly in the CCEE and NIS. An adequate solution has not yet been found to deal with exposure to psychosocial stresses (such as monotony, overwork and lack of job satisfaction), although the ensuing health problems are increasing.<P>
Across the Region, 25 000 fatal accidents occur at work each year and 10 million workers are estimated to be injured. Data deficiencies prevent Region-wide comparisons of figures other than those for deaths from accidents or particular diseases. Nevertheless, about 2 million cases of occupational disease are estimated to occur each year. Improvements in the work environment would be cost-effective; they would lead to savings from the reduced loss of productivity and social costs (such as those of treatment). In addition, occupational health services provide a unique opportunity for health promotion.<P>
<a name="t26"><H2>Appropriate care</A></H2>
<H3>Health for all principles influence agendas for health care reform</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="/policy/hfa01.htm#P26">Health for all, target 26</A></h4>




Appropriate care is an important part of the European strategy for health for all. The strategy assumes that the analysis of the shortcomings of the Region's health care systems and the current efforts to remedy them focus on promoting health development and health gain. These goals may be easier to achieve, and the outcome is more likely to be properly monitored and evaluated, if the following conditions are met.<P>
<UL>
<LI>A health policy clearly focused on health development and health gain has been adopted.
<LI>The key actors in the health development process (citizens' and patients' organizations, the professional elite, professional organizations, health care managers and administrators, and the health care industrv) have explicitly expressed commitment to the targets of the policy.
<LI>A mechanism has been established that en sures health advocacy and investment in the infrastructures of both the communitv and health services.
<LI>The criteria for analysing health care reform options and "trade-offs" include targets for health, and the indicators for monitoring organizational development are in place.
<LI>A clear link has been established between resource management decisions (on financing, human resources, technological solutions, pharmaceuticals, facilities) and targets for health development and health gain.
</UL>
As mentioned, many countries and regions have produced policy documents based on or making use of the strategy for health for all, including: Finland (in 1987), Wales (1990), the former Czechoslovakia (1992), England (1992), the Netherlands (1992), Turkey (1993), Ireland (1994) and Kyrgyzstan (1994). These initiatives, along with current work on this subject in Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania and by many regional authorities across the Region, are helping to give a sharper focus to health care policy-making and reform. A strong link between health care reform and health policies is more likely when a health policy statement includes explicit policy options for health care. This has not always been the case in the examples given in Table 4.2.<P>



<P><B>See: <a href="tab42.gif">Table 4.2 Assessment of the health policy documents of selected countries</A></B>
<p>




Nevertheless, considerations of health gain can influence the development of health care systems in countries or regions in which political culture, institutional settings and/or administrative constraints hinder the adoption of a comprehensive and explicit health policy. This influence can work through the agenda for health care management or the quality of care.<P>
After an expected incubation period of some years, the philosophy of health for all is influencing health care reform agendas throughout the Region.<P>
<H3>Health care financing: mounting pressure on public entitlement to care</H3>
Factors including economic problems, the aging of the population and continuous developments in health technology have brought the issue of health care expenditure to the top of the policy agenda. In addition, a more general debate on the nature and future of the welfare society and, more specifically, on different sets of beliefs about the merits of public and private health care financing, have helped to focus attention on the public's entitlement to health care.<P>
Public financing of health care is much greater than private financing in most countries of the European Region. As the examples in Fig.4.6 indicate, this predominance is most pronounced in the wealthier countries. In the last several years, however, the share of private financing has risen in many countries, and there are indications that this trend has accelerated in the early 1990s.<P>




<h4>See: Fig. 4.6 Public and private expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP in selected countries of the European Region, 1979-1991<p>
<a href="fig46a.gif">Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Italy</A><p>
<a href="fig46b.gif">United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Turkey</A></h4>
Source: Adapted from <i>New orientations for social policy.</I><p>

Is this a beneficial long-term tendency? Two basic approaches to financing can be identified.<P>
The first is mainly normative and restrictive in character, and uses implicit rationing and explicit cuttmg back. Impliclt ranonlng means that some services are unavailable or limited, resulting in delays and queuing. Explicit cutting back of social protection systems results when the central government introduces a "basic basket" or package of essential services and cost-sharing mechanisms outside a clear health care policy framework, aiming at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system as a whole. Such measures are often seen as the first step towards a more general policy to place further limits on the scope of the social protection systems.<P>
The second trend is mainly linked with the development and empowerment of decision-making at the local level. This requires more rigour and better horizontal integration between the main social protection systems, and between health care and community care. This permits:<P>
<UL>

<LI>general principles and rules on entitlements to services at the national level to be further pursued at the local level;
<LI>negotiations and shared decision-making by health service managers, health care providers and citizens or patients; and
<LI>the agreement and monitoring of explicit local targets on health gain, efficient use of resources, and the satisfaction of patients and providers.
</UL>
An appropriate mix of policy tools at the national and local levels plays a major role in these developments. This allows decision-makers to design market mechanisms that promote choices on: quality and prices, the planning of capital investment, contracting between purchasers and providers, and promoting patients' rights. Important elements of the health care debate in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom focus on these aspects. Countries with more decentralized decision-making structures, such as the Nordic countries, have an added advantage when pursuing this line of development.<P>
It seems clear that the social protection systems of the Region will need reform in depth, rather than simple reductions in their financing and benefits. This may become one of the major political issues of the turn of the century.<P>
<H3>"Insurance reform" in the CCEE: policy tool or a goal in itself?</H3>
Many of the CCEE have set the attainment of a health insurance system as the main policy objective of health care reform. The appeal of insurance reform lies in the belief that it results in a more effective mechanism for mobilizing financial resources for health care. Further, it is thought that health insurance will more readily provide the policy and managerial means for rapidly improving the status and pay of undervalued health professionals, especially physicians. In the current phase of transition to a new political, social and economic environment, insurance reform in health care has come to symbolize the change to a more pluralistic and open society.<P>
Countries have approached this transition in different ways. The Czech Republic has moved rapidly into a more pluralistic model, and the Baltic countries, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia are working rapidly but through a more structured solution. Poland is treating it cautiously as a policy option, while Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are working in a more experimental way.<P>
All countries work within considerable financial constraints. Deep recession and increasing unemployment impede resource mobilization of the magnitude required to replace budgetary funding of health care, and there are not enough mechanisms to regulate escalating costs. The complexity of the health care reform process and the deeplv rooted historical, cultural and political features of each country's health care system have often been severely underestimated. In some cases, as in the Czech Republic, insurance reform has started a substantial change in the national health care culture. Only recently, however, has health insurance begun to be understood as a policy tool, rather than as a goal in itself.<P>
Table 4.3 shows the difficult and rapidly changing situation in the countries moving towards health insurance. Even before legislation comes into force, debates begin about changing or amending it. Some countries have passed laws but been unable to implement them. The countries need a wider consensus and a more realistic view on the implementation of health insurance.<P>

<a name="t27"><H3>Privatization and decentralization: what is the role of market mechanisms in health care effectiveness and efficiency?</A></H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P27">Health for all, target 27</A></h4>




During the 1980s, the notion emerged in many countries that the health sector in modern European society was particularly inefficient. The pursuit of efficiency has taken many forms, including introducing mechanisms for incentive remuneration, increasing competition between providers and adopting policies that foster prevention, primary care and community care. In addition, decentralized responsibility for management and financing, privatized provider services and increased consumer choice and influence in decision-making have all been pursued to varying degrees. They can also be seen as ways of increasing efficiency.<P>
In the European Region, privatization is first and foremost a political concept. In some countries, the privatization of health care facilities entails nothing more than a change of ownership from state to municipal authorities, while health insurance operates with public funds. Some private systems include virtually no competition, and some public systems base salaries on productivity.<P>

Innovations gaining popularity in the western European and Nordic countries with a national health service include: market principles, competition, the purchaser-provider split, mixed remuneration systems (using both fee-for-service and capitation methods), contracting of services, fund holding by general practitioners, and the principles of freedom of choice and of the money following the patient. A serious effort to evaluate these innovations across countries is underway.<P>
Elements of privatization and market mechanisms can have a positive impact (such as reducing queues) on more regulated health care systems, such as those in Germany, the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. The impact so far, however, has been mainly on efficiency, while improvements in effectiveness, cost-containment and equity remain to be proven.<P>
Some areas in central Europe (Croatia, the Czech Republic and the eastern <I>Laender </I>of Germany) have shifted rapidly from a centralized, state-run organization of health care to a health insurance system. With the exception of Germany, where considerable know-how support came from the west, attempts to privatize public health services have been slow, complex and difficult.<P>
Pharmacies in western Europe have traditionally been private, even in countries with national health services. Those in the CCEE were often among the first health facilities to be privatized. I he shortages of more advanced and expensive western drugs disappeared, but the prices skyrocketed almost overnight. In addition, liberal drug registration policies resulted in a proliferation of brand names, causing confusion among consumers.<P>
Decentralization and privatization are concepts that are debated from different perspectives and implemented with different objectives in the countries of the European Region. The regionalization of Europe is already a fact, and this trend seems set to prevail in health service reforms. In some countries, the health care systems of regions differ so much that they have few common features. A key problem with privatization and decentralization is that they are being used as goals in themselves, not as the means to achieve better health outcomes .<P>
<H3>Citizens' voice still squeaking, choice increasing</H3>
Over the past few years, greater freedom of choice for patients has been one of the most common explicit objectives of health care reform in the European Region. Current trends reinforce the belief that empowering citizens and patients to become stronger advocates of their own health care is of paramount importance for the attainment of true patient choice. In addition, well informed and satisfied patients have been proved to have better health outcomes.<P>

The increasing vitality of the European patients' rights movement is important here. At a WHO consultation in March 1994, 35 European Member States adopted a resolution on the promotion of patients' rights that builds on the achievements already attained by countries such as Finland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. This important resolution provides a clear agenda for action on patients' rights in the Region.<P>
Health professionals have usually decided what kinds of health service are good for people. In most countries, health care systems frown on the practice of referring to patients as clients or consumers; they expect patients to be patients.<P>
Nevertheless, the growing importance of consumer movements is clearlv apparent in the health sector. In the CCEE and NIS, this may create problems, especially as these countries have so many unmet needs. On the other hand, paying attention to consumers' views and patient satisfaction seems to be an area in which relatively small investments could achieve considerable improvements. Making services more user-friendly is not a question of money; it depends more on the attitudes of professionals and administrators.<P>
<a name="t28"><H3>Well established role for primary health care</H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P28">Health for all, target 28</A></h4>



The role of primary health care (PHC) in the delivery of health care is well established in the Region. The large amounts of funds devoted to development in the CCEE and NIS by the EU PHARE programme and the World Bank, for example, testify to this.<P>
Countries with a traditional focus on specialized care have made a commitment to PHC in their national policy statements (Sweden) or in recent organizational arrangements (Germany). In addition, countries are clearly shifting from a PHC that is structured and based on input to one that focuses more on functions, output and outcomes. The numerous projects on communications technology in PHC, sponsored by the EU, show the growing information and communication needs in this area.<P>
During the 1980s countries such as Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy and the Netherlands transferred resources into PHC. In southern countries of the region, such as Greece and Spain, no significant increase in PHC financing in relation to hospital care occurred, despite the emphasis placed on health care reform based on PHC.<P>
PHC has shown impressive progress and aroused renewed interest. Nevertheless, a group of key PHC experts from Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom identified barriers to access to PHC services in 1993. These included out-of-pocket co-payments and uneven geographic availability, which particularly affect poorer people, immigrants, members of ethnic groups, and people living in inner cities or remote rural areas.<P>
<a name="t29"><H3>Changing hospital care</A></H3>


<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P29">Health for all, target 29</A></h4>

Today, as hospitals become more like businesses, they are spinning off some of their traditional functions, such as hotel or casualty services (hospitals without beds), and extending some services to the home (hospitals without walls).<P>
Information systems, the use of modern communication technologies, management, quality of patient care and communication with consumers have considerably improved. Hospitals are providing more outpatient services. Very large hospitals are no longer being built. Medium-sized general hospitals and community-based facilities for residential treatment and rehabilitation seem gradually to be replacing specialized hospitals, including mental health institutions.<P>
Three key factors have helped to move hospitals into this position. They are:<P>
<UL>
<LI> greater accountability with associated changes in financing;<P>
<LI> increasing competitive pressures resulting from the purchasing of services, and consumers' greater knowledge of, choice of and demands for health care; and<P>
<LI> the increasing cost of medical technology.<P>
</UL>
Some hospitals are taking steps to increase their work on health promotion for their staff and the surrounding communitv by joining or endorsing the new movement of health-promoting hospitals. More than 20 hospitals from Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have participated in a pilot project since 1993, and national networks are being developed. In addition, the east-west hospital twinning project reflects increasing hospital autonomy and prospects for cooperation.<P>
Modern hospitals are making alliances and developing other, more stable links and networks to search for economy of scale and in better differentiating their products.<P>
<H3>Health care professions in transition: strong movement in general practice, more recognition of nursing</H3>
In most western countries of the Region, general practice has made progress in defining its contribution to health care during the past two decades. This shows how building up a professional profile needs a long-term perspective, to allow acceptance by the public, academics and other professional groups. This necessity should not be underestimated in the countries that have recently adopted strong general practice policies.<P>
In most countries, medical graduates can no longer enter general practice without formal education leading to official recognition as specialists in the field. EU Directive 93/16/EEC requires two years of full-time training in general medical practice as from 1 January 1995 in all member countries. University departments of general practice, professional and scientific associations of general practitioners, academic bodies and scientific journals have all multiplied.<P>
In the CCEE and NIS, general practice is increasingly related to family medicine, and has been recognized as a crucial element of better primary medical services. This implies both more freedom and a broader professional perspective for physicians, who seek to achieve the status of independent contractors and to secure a better income, and more choice for citizens in deciding whom to consult. The introduction of more stringent training and the expanding role of professional associations in this area are other examples of the vitality of the profession.<P>
The role of general practice in the delivery of health care continues to evolve. It is assuming new functions, in addition to its traditional therapeutic ones, to meet communities' needs, along with nurses and other health professionals.<P>
A variety of factors impedes the effective delivery of nursing services in most countries of the European Region. These include the virtual absence of nurses from policy-making and decision-making at all levels of the health care system, shortages of well trained nurses, insufficient resources to support the work of nurses and midwives, and the undervaluation of nursing with its concomitant subordination to medicine. Countries vary widely in the progress made in overcoming these barriers to effective nursing. Recognition seems to be growing, however, of the need to appraise the role of nursing to fulfil its potential in health care delivery.<P>
As nurses' starting points, initial conditions, and professional roles and functions differ widely between countries, so do approaches to each. Nevertheless, some newly emerging trends can be distinguished.<P>
First, nursing is part of the more general trend to increase the cost-effectiveness of health care delivery. This includes efforts to measure the outcomes of nursing interventions, particularly in the United Kingdom and northern Europe. Second, interest is growing in nursing education. Key issues here include: the review and reorientation to PHC of curricula, the development of new programmes (especially in higher education), training of nurse educators, provision of better educational materials, schemes for continuing education, and closer links between nursing education and services. Third, attitudes towards the position of nursing in society and health care delivery are changing. The perception of nursing as a low-status occupation requiring minimal training, and the associated undervaluation of psychosocial elements of care are beginning to shift, though progress is still slow and uneven among countries.<P>


<a name="t31"><H3>Continuous quest for quality of care throughout the Region</A></H3>

<h4>See: <a href="../../policy/hfa01.htm#P31">Health for all, target 31</A></h4>



There is general consensus on the objective of quality assurance activities: to improve the outcome of health care in terms of health functional ability, patient wellbeing, consumer satisfaction and cost effectiveness. There is also consensus on the need to strengthen quality assurance at all levels of the health care sector: among providers of health care, third-party payers, health institutions, and national and international authorities.<P>
Further, it is agreed that making assessment, self-evaluation and comparison with peer results a permanent component of health professionals' activities would achieve quality assurance at all levels of health care.<P>
In collaboration with the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Forum of Medical Associations (EFMA) endorsed a policy on quality of care development in 1992. This has been the cornerstone of such a policy in the Region. National medical associations from 35 countries participated in framing the policy. It recommends that national medical associations take a leading role in quality of care development. Securing the quality of medical care is primarily the responsibility of physicians, and is therefore an ethical, educational and professional responsibility inherent in the independence of the profession.<P>
Some countries have confirmed that quality of care will be included in future legislation. These include Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom.<P>
Countries have carried out considerable research in quality assurance. The work is coordinated at both the international and national levels. Countries still use different parameters, however, which has often prevented the comparison of results.<P>
Nevertheless, significant progress has already been made in identifying common quality indicators in some fields. European consensus meetings have been held that validated indicators for perinatal and obstetrical care, mental health, diabetes, hospital infection and the use of antibiotics, and oral health care.<P>
Pilot European databases on common outcome indicators have been designed for perinatal and obstetric care (to be hosted in Germany and United Kingdom), hospital infection (Denmark),diabetes management (Germany), orthopaedic surgery (Norway) and oral health care (Denmark).<P>
The CCEE and NIS have shown considerable interest in outcome indicators. These countries have a long tradition of data collection although with weaker standardized methodologies and use.<P>
In surgical interventions, a computerized information system using a basic indicator set has been established and widely tested, particularly in Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands. Results in Denmark show a 25% reduction of hospital-acquired infections in general surgery, and over a 50% reduction in wound infection in vascular surgery in the last three years. Belgium and the Netherlands are setting up a joint database to monitor results and achievements.<P>
Progress in diabetes and oral health management based on outcome indicators has been considerable. The European Commission has supported the establishment of a quality network in the EU and some CCEE through its Advanced Informatics in Medicine programme. In addition, active participation and support from industry are important in this area.<P>

<H1 align=center>5. Conclusion
</H1><P>
<hr>
<h4><a href="part0h.htm">Go back to contents</A></h4>



The European Region could be much healthier. Political transition, wide-ranging reforms, shifting public health priorities and unprecedented change characterize the Region today. The combined effects of unfavourable socioeconomic trends, social unrest, migration and war in some parts of the Region have taken their toll on health. The rise of poverty and violence, especially in the CCEE and NIS, has had a serious impact on the most vulnerable.<P>

The health gap between the CCEE and NIS and the rest of the Region continues to widem It is largely due to cardiovascular diseases, external causes and cancer, which are linked to unhealthy lifestyles, and deficient disease prevention services. Many early deaths can be prevented.<P>

Experience in western Europe shows that comprehensive programmes for health promotion and disease prevention pay dividends. Smoking, alcohol abuse and unsafe sex continue to be responsible for substantial ill health and mortality throughout the Region. More and more countries are developing infrastructures and programmes for health promotion.<P>

The main obstacles are not only financial but also an adherence to outdated approaches to promoting health. Anti-tobacco legislation is gaining ground.<P>

Life expectancy continues to improve in western Europe and is perhaps approaching a ceiling. Clearly, appropriate measures are needed to compare improvements in the quality of life across countries. Infant mortality remains high in some central Asian republics of the NIS, exceeding 40 per l000 live births. Maternal mortality is falling. Issues needing more attention include equity and the special needs of women and the elderly, particularly in relation to chronic illness and disability, social support, domestic violence, and access to services .<P>

The policy for health for all has gained influence throughout the Region. A new model for public health action has emerged. Central governments, regions and cities are integrating a broader philosophy of public health into their policies, with emphasis on disease prevention, health promotion and primary care.<P>

There is political commitment to environmental policies. It is disturbing, however, that l 2% of people in the Region (mainly in the NIS) do not have access to clean water, and that one third of the Region's population lives in cities with air pollution levels above the WHO guideline limits.<P>

The strategy for health for all should now influence health service and public health reforms more than ever. The Region is a vast laboratory of experimentation with different ways of financing and supporting health care. The evidence to demonstrate which approaches work, and which do not, is still scarce. The challenge is to ensure a high quality of care and sensitivity to special needs that bring about health gain. Increasing opportunities for citizens and patients to express their rights, exercise choice and influence health care, are of major importance in improving health services and health care outcomes.<P>

The Region today has gained breathtaking momentum for change. The opportunities to make a difference are immense. This is the main challenge for the WHO Regional Office for Europe in its cooperation with Member States.<P>

<H1 align=center>Annex 1</H1>
<hr>

<H2>WHO European Public Health Knowledge Base</H2><P>

The public health knowledge of the Regional Office is based on information from national and international sources and from the databases and information bases of technical units in the Regional Office. These databases are at different stages of development and are maintained either in the Regional Office or by WHO collaborating centres and other key information partners (see Table A).<P>

<H3>Information infrastructure</H3><P>

The European public health knowledge base has been designed according to the structure of the strategy for health for all: prerequisites for health, health status and determinants of health (lifestyles, environment, health care) and support mechanisms. Table B describes its main components.<P>

<H3>Partners and users</H3><P>

The partners and human networks include people in health and other ministries, WHO liaison offices, national
documentation centres, WHO collaborating centres and other specialized centres, or local authorities of areas participating in specific WHO projects. The wide range of users of the Regional Office's information range from national authorities and international organizations to individual citizens and local health care providers.<P>

<H3>Communication strategy</H3><P>

The communication strategy of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, combines the following communication means: personal communication through meetings, conferences, country visits, workshops, etc. and communicating through electronic means. The main development in the latter in the European Regional Office is WHO-CIPHER (Centre for Information on Public Health in the European Region) and its demonstration model. It includes six communication applications (mail, TELENET, mail-list, FTP, Gopher, Web) to illustrate the potential possibilities in these services. These can add a new dimension to the communication between Member States, and between the Member States and the Regional Office.<P>

Units in the Regional Office are linked to each other, to WHO headquarters in Geneva and to selected international
organizations by electronic mail. Some of the Member States (mostly the liaison offices in the CCEE and NIS ) have also been connected through electronic mail facilities, primarily on the Internet. Diskettes with data from the health for all database are widely available. CARE Telematics is a pilot project on an electronic communication network, carried out by different partners under WHO's leadership and as part of an EU initiative. Another example of a pilot project is the telematic system for quality assurance in oral health care (ORATEL).<P>

The Regional Office also communicates through the mass media, building a network with key European media to disseminate information on its policies, programmes and activities. Finally, the Regional Office generates an immense amount of  information in the form of books and documents. The books are sold through WHO headquarters in bookshops around the world, while the Regional Office and its technical units distribute the documents.<P>

<H2><A NAME="A01">Updating the guidelines</A> </H2>

<P>
Since the publication of <I>Air quality guidelines for Europe</I>
in 1987, new scientific data have been gathered on air pollution
toxicology and epidemiology, and risk assessment methodologies
have developed further. These have necessitated the updating and
revision of the existing guidelines.
<P>
Since 1993, experts have gathered at a series of meetings to discuss
a variety of priority chemicals. The updating procedure has been
led by the Operational Division of the WHO European Centre for
Environment and Health in Bilthoven, Netherlands, in cooperation
with the International programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) and
the Commission of the European Communities (CEC).
<P>
The revised <I>Air quality guidelines for Europe</I> will be published
in 1997.

<P>
Since the publication of <I>Air quality guidelines for Europe</I>
in 1987, new scientific data on air pollution toxicology and epidemiology
have accumulated and new developments in risk assessment methodologies
have taken place. These necessitate the updating and/or revision
of the existing guidelines. To initiate the updating procedure,
which will be conducted in collaboration with the European Union
and the International Programme on Chemical Safety, a planning
meeting was held at the Bilthoven division of the WHO European
Centre for Environment and Health. The issues discussed included
criteria for the inclusion of substances or mixtures, strategies
for the derivation of guidelines, ways and means of regularly
updating the guidelines, and the format of publication. A list
of pollutants to be included in the second edition was agreed
on, and it was recommended that working groups be set up to deal
with methodologies as well as with specific groups of air pollutants.
A provisional timetable was also agreed on.<BR>

<P>
Within the framework for updating and revising the WHO <I>Air
quality guidelines </I>for Europe, a meeting of the Working Group
on Methodology and Format was held at the WHO European Centre
for Environment and Health in Bilthoven, Netherlands, from 20
to 22 September 1993 to discuss such topics as the types of health
effect to be considered, the methods to apply in order to assess
the risk of threshold and non-threshold effects, and the effects
of air pollutants at different levels of exposure (and/or dose)
and how these should be demonstrated. The participants also discussed
the structure of the individual chapters of the second edition
of the guidelines, the possibilities for illustrating dose-response
relationships and the methods to be applied in deriving guideline
values or risk estimates for carcinogens and non-carcinogens.
The Group emphasized the need to make a clear distinction between
guidelines and standards and to advise on how to move from guidelines
to standards. They felt that including a separate chapter on standard
setting would be inappropriate, but that an account of the factors
that could be considered in standard setting should be included
in the introductory chapters of the second edition.<BR>

Within the framework for the updating and revising of the WHO
Air Quality Guidelines for Europe, a meeting of the Working Group
on Ecotoxic Effects was held in Les Diablerets, Switzerland, from
21 to 23 September 1994. The meeting was attended by 17 experts
from 7 countries, a representative each from UN/ECE and CEC-DG
XI, as well as staff members of WHO-ECEH and IPCS. The group discussed
ecological effects of airborne pollutants. Draft chapters dealing
with sulfur dioxide (including sulfur and total acid deposition),
nitrogen dioxide (and other nitrogen compounds) and ozone had
been prepared by scientific experts in this field and were circulated
in advance among the members of the working group. The outcome
of the meeting was the finalization of ecological risk evaluations
of the compounds discussed, and the decision on guideline values
(critical levels and critical loads).<BR>

<P>
Within the framework for updating and revising the WHO Air quality
guidelines for Europe, a meeting of the Working Group on &quot;Classical&quot;
Air Pollutants was held at the National Institute of Public Health
and Environmental Protection (RIVM) in Bilthoven, Netherlands,
from 11 to 14 October 1994 to assess the health effects of exposure
to carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone/photooxidants, sulphur
dioxide and particulate matter. The group consisted of 17 experts
from 11 countries, as well as 2 observers from 2 countries, a
representative from the EC, and WHO staff. The group has discussed
working papers prepared for the meeting and circulated in advance,
and has derived, by consensus a set of recommended guideline values
for the reviewed pollutants. No such value has been proposed for
particulate matter; instead, estimates of health impacts related
to various concentration of this type of pollution have been proposed.

Within the framework for updating and revising the <I>Air Quality
Guidelines for Europe</I>, the Working Group on PCBs, PCDDs and
PCDFs met in Maastricht, Netherlands, on 8-10 May 1995. The Group
consisted of nine experts from five countries, as well as WHO
staff. Two working papers, one dealing with polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins
(PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and the other
one dealing with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were discussed.
Although direct inhalation exposure was not a major route of uptake
of these compounds, ambient levels may significantly contribute
to total human exposure. Efforts to reduce current levels should
be continued. A number of recommendations were made that related
to needs for research, risk assessment and risk management.<BR>

<H1>Summary of recent findings</A></H1>
<hr>
</center>

<H2>Major areas of concern</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The environmental and socioeconomic situation have harmed the health status of the Estonian population,
particularly that of vulnerable groups.
<LI>As in Latvia, Lithuania and the Russian Federation, life expectancy and the birth rate fell dramatically in
Estonia during the early 1990s. The gap in life expectancy between Estonia and the average for the European Region
increased from 4.3 years in 1981 to 7 years in 1993. The gap between Estonian males and females grew from 10
years in 1981 to 11.4 years in 1993, becoming one of the widest in the Region.
<LI>Having remained above 2 for 22 years, the total fertility rate (average number of children born to a woman
during her lifetime) decreased from 2.12 in 1985 to 1.7 in 1992 and to 1.45 in 1993. This fact, along with the rising
death rates, resulted in a natural rate of increase of minus 4.0 per 1000 population in 1993.
<LI>Infant mortality rose from 12.3 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 15.5 in 1993, although the increase seems to be
largely explained by the recalculation of figures according to WHO recommendations.
<LI>In 1993, mortality from ischaemic heart disease for both men and women under 65 years was almost three
times as high as the average for the Region. Mortality from external causes of injury and poisoning was the second
highest in the Region.
<LI>As in other central and eastern European countries, abortion has long been one of the main methods of birth
control in Estonia. The high ratios of abortions to births continue to rise. In 1993, there were 1687 abortions per
1000 live births.
<LI>Prices and people's access to food limit and hit vulnerable groups the hardest.
<LI>The high levels of several risk factors, such as psychosocial stress, occupational hazards, smoking, the high
proportion of fat in the diet, undetected arterial hypertension and serious environmental pollution, have contributed
to high morbidity rates in the population.
<LI>Almost 45% of sewage requiring treatment is treated either inadequately or not at all.
<LI>The transition from a planned to a market economy has aggravated problems in the quality of health services.
<LI>Estonia has fewer nurses (507 per 100 000 population) than in any of the Nordic or other Baltic countries
(with an average of 783 nurses per 100 000).

Estonia is the smallest of the three Baltic republics (Table 1). 1)  The terrain is relatively flat, rich in inland bodies
of water and with forests covering approximately 40% of the land. The coastline is characterized by numerous bays,
straits and islets: there are over 1500 islands, the largest being Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. Because of its maritime
location, Estonia has a moderate climate with cool summers and mild winters, and heavy rainfall.<p>

<p>
Estonia became independent on 20 August 1991. The country is divided into 15 counties with an average population
of about 100 000 (ranging from 30 000 to 500 000), 33 towns (including 6 independent municipalities) and 26 urban
areas. There are 265 municipalities. Public administration is organized at the national, county and municipal
levels.<P>
The capital had a population of 502 400 in 1991. Other major cities are Tartu (population 115 300), Narva (87 900),
Kohtla-Järve (90 300), Pärnu (58 600) and Sillamäe (20 700) <I>(4)</I>.


<H2>Population </H2>
Estonians belong to the Baltic-Finnish group of the Finno-Ugrian peoples. The official language is Estonian. The
ethnic composition of the population has changed significantly since the end of the Second World War, when many
people from the USSR moved to Estonia. The right to citizenship is a major political issue. Estonians make up most
of the population (Fig. 1); minorities and other ethnic groups defined by the Government include people of Russian
origin, Ukrainians (3%), Belarussians (2%) and others (3%). The non-Estonian population is concentrated in the
north-eastern industrial areas, comprising 9096% of the population in some towns. The predominant church is the
Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, followed by Russian Orthodox <I>(5)</I>.<P>

<a href="fig01.gif"><H4>Fig. 1. Ethnic composition of the population</A></H4>
<i>Source: Hunter (4)</i>



In 1993, the population was about 1.51 million, 12.8% of whom were aged 65 years and over <I>(1).</I> The
proportion of pensioners (men aged over 60 and women over 55) increased slightly (Fig. 2), from 19.3% of the
population in 1980 to 20.5% in 1991 <I>(5)</I>.<P>

<H4><a href="fig02.gif">Fig. 2. Age pyramid</A></H4>



The crude birth rate decreased from about 15 live births per 1000 inhabitants in 1980 to 14.1 in 1990 and 10.0 in
1993 (Fig. 3). Having remained above 2.0 for 22 years, the total fertility rate declined from 2.12 in 1985 to 1.7 in
1992 and 1.45 in 1993.  The age-specific fertility rate for women aged 2024 years fell by 5% between 1985 and
1990, although it increased by almost 14% for those aged 1519 <I>(5)</I>. The population's natural rate of
increase dropped from 2.5 per 1000 in 1980 to minus 1.3 in 1992 and minus 4.0 in 1993 <I>(1,2).</I><P>

<H4><a href="fig03.gif">Fig. 3. Crude death rate and live births per 1000 population</A></H4>





Between 1979 and 1991, the marriage rate per 1000 inhabitants decreased to 6.6 but the divorce rate remained fairly
stable at 3.7. The marriage rate is one of the lowest in the Baltic republics (<I>3).</I> About 50% of marriages end
in divorce.<P>


<H2>Education</H2>
According to the 1989 census, 45.6% of the population over 15 years of age had a secondary school education. Of
these, 13.5% had a university or other post-secondary education.<P>
The major objective of education reforms is to re-establish a national identity <I>(6)</I>. The 108 schools in which
Russian is the principal language of instruction are updating their curricula and adding a further year, in line with the
roughly 530 schools using the Estonian language <I>(5,6)</I>. All higher education will be in Estonian <I>(5).
</I>There are 41 schools for disabled children, but there appears to be a move towards integrating these children
into primary and secondary schools <I>(5).</I> The Government has recognized that the quality of teachers in
secondary schools and rural areas needs improvement <I>(6)</I>. In addition, some textbooks need to be rewritten
to reflect current views of politics, history and management.<P>



<H2>Economy</H2>

The Government is strongly committed to a market economy and moved early to liberalize prices and modernize the
legal and institutional framework to prepare for the privatization of state enterprises <I>(8</I>). Privatization is one
of the most successful elements in the economic reform programme. The Government aimed to reach its target of
having 40% of the industrial sector in private hands by the end of 1994. The sharp rise in prices however, has forced
the Government to postpone further price liberalization measures, and to retain subsidies on certain food products
for fear of the impact of their elimination on vulnerable groups <I>(8).</I><P>
Nevertheless, in view of the emergence of Estonia from recession, increased privatization and trade with the
Russian Federation are expected to push growth in the real gross domestic product (GDP) up to 5% in 1995 (Table
2). Government success in controlling the money supply and restricting credit means that inflation looked set to
remain at around an annual average of 50% in 1994 before slowing to 20% in 1995 <I>(7)</I>.<P>

<I>Source: Country report Baltic republics (7).</I><P>





GDP is estimated to have grown at an annual rate of about 6% in the late 1980s, but it fell in 1990 - 1993 (Fig. 4),
largely owing to the collapse of the former USSR trade and distribution system <I>(7).</I><P>


<H4><a href="fig04.gif">Fig. 4. GDP per head (purchasing power parities) in the Baltic states</A></H4>







Real private consumption fell sharply in 1991<I> (8)</I>, owing to worsening shortages and a sharp decline in real
incomes. Since 1990, the pace of price liberalization has largely determined inflation. Compensation in the
government sector has lagged behind other sectors, partly because the pay scale is linked to the minimum wage and
does not take full account of inflation. As a result, real wages in the public sector dropped by close to 40% between
1990 and 1991 <I>(8)</I>.<P>
In September 1991, Estonia applied for membership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. At the
end of 1991 and in 1992, several missions from these two organizations, among others, to Estonia reviewed the
situation and provided technical assistance with central banking, fiscal issues and national statistics<I> (8)</I>.<P>
Estonia introduced its own currency, the kroon, in 1992. The exchange rate in November 1994 was 11.9 kroons to
the $1; earlier in the year, it was around 13.




<H2>Unemployment and social security </H2>

Despite the sharp drop in output since 1991, unemployment has remained at under 3% of the labour force.
Unemployed workers receive compensation equivalent to 80% of the minimum wage for a maximum of 180 days.
Vulnerable groups, such as unemployed mothers, pensioners and invalids, are eligible for special assistance. Benefits
for almost all social programmes are paid out of the Social Security Fund, which is financed by a 20% social security
tax paid by employers <I>(8)</I>.<P>



<H2>Current issues</H2>
In 1990, exports were about equally divided between the countries of central and eastern Europe (CCEE) and the
newly independent states (NIS) of the former USSR and western countries, mainly Finland and Sweden. Imports
(principally textiles, processed foods and grain) were also divided between CCEE and NIS and the west, mainly
Finland and the United States <I>(8).</I> The Russian Federation remains the main export customer and the second
source of imports after Finland<I> (7). </I>While the values for major social and health indicators resemble those of
more affluent industrialized countries, the relatively low income per head and the current economic situation in all
three Baltic states more closely resemble those of less developed countries <I>(6).</I><P>
Estonia depends on imported petroleum which was previously purchased at prices far below world market levels.
The rise in prices has led to severe fuel shortages. The restrictions on supplies of heating fuel during the winter make
everyday life very difficult.<P>

<H1>Health status</H1>
<HR>
</center>
<H2>Life expectancy and mortality</H2>
As in the Russian Federation, Latvia and Lithuania, life expectancy in Estonia decreased between 1987 and 1993,
after an increase during 1985/1986 that was possibly due to the anti-alcohol campaign. By 1993, life expectancy was
62.6 years for males and 74.0 for females. As in the other Baltic states, the differences in life expectancy between
men and women (11.4 years) is wider than in most countries of the European Region. The overall life expectancy in
1993 was 68.2 years, 7 years below the European average (Fig. 5). a) This gap continues to widen (Fig. 6). One
suggested explanation for the difference allocates 30% of the gap to socioeconomic conditions, 50% to individual
risk factors, 5% to environmental conditions and 15% to failings in the health services <I>(9)</I>.<P>
a) The figures show averages for different groups of countries in the Region (the European Union (EU), the CCEE
and the NIS).  Averages for the Region are labelled EUR and the acronym EST is used for Estonia.<P>



<h4><a href="fig05.gif">Fig. 5. Life expectancy at birth in some countries of the European Region, around 1992</A></h4>





In 1993, mortality rates for males and females were 1828.5 and 928.1 per 100 000 population, respectively. Male
and female mortality is close to 50% greater than the European average.<P>
The leading causes of death in 1993 were the same as in most other countries of the Region: cardiovascular diseases
(54.8%), cancer (16.3%) and external causes (14%).  As in the other Baltic states, the mortality rate from external
causes is high, more than three times the European average: 308.5 per 100 000 for males and 69.9 per 100 000 for
females. Although mortality from motor vehicle accidents has gone down since 1991, it is still well above the
European average. Between 1990 and 1993, mortality from homicide more than doubled (43.5 per 100 000 for men
and 9 for women in 1993) and suicide went up by one third (66.3 per 100 000 for men and 14.2 for women in
1993).<P>


<H4><a href="fig06.gif">Fig. 6. trends in life expectancy at birth, Estonia and the Region</A></H4>


Cardiovascular mortality remains quite high; the rate for ischaemic heart disease in people aged 064 years was 113
per 100 000 (201.6 for men and 42.0 for women) in 1993, almost three times the European average. The current
situation in Estonia is similar to that two decades ago in the North Karelia region of Finland <I>(5)</I>. Fig. 7-12
show standardized death rates (SDRs) for cardiovascular diseases in Estonia and other countries and groups of
countries in the European Region.

<H2>Major cardiovascular risk factors</H2>
Data from the baseline surveys carried out in demonstration areas in 1982-1987 by the participating countries of the
WHO countrywide integrated noncommunicable disease intervention (CINDI) programme show the prevalence of
important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in people aged 25-64 years <I>(10)</I>. More women (70.9%)
than men (65.5%) had body mass index (BMI) values over 25. Estonia had one of the highest values for both sexes
in the areas studied (Fig. 13).

<H4><a href="fig13.gif">Fig. 13. Percentage of people aged 25-64 with a BMI over 25 in some countries of the European Region</A></H4>
Source: Morgenstern et al. <I>(10)</I><p>




In addition, CINDI data showed that 37.2% of men and 25.8% of women had high blood pressure (over 160/95
mmHg). Estonia had the highest value for men and the second highest for women in the areas studied (Fig. 14).

<H4><a href="fig14.gif">Fig. 14. Percentage of people aged 25-64 with hypertension in some countries of the European Region</A></H4>
Source: Morgenstern et al. <I>(10)</I><p>




Further, 52.2% of men and 19.8% of women smoked.  Here, Estonia ranked in the middle of the CINDI study areas
(Fig. 15).<P>

<H4><a href="fig15.gif">Fig. 15. Percentage of smokers among people aged 25-64 in some countries of the European Region</A></H4>
Source: Morgenstern et al. <I>(10)</I><p>


In view of the current difficult socioeconomic situation, these high levels can be assumed to have risen even
further.<P>




<H2>Other important causes of death</H2>
Mortality from cancer in people aged 0-64 (where the causes of death are better ascertained) is higher than
the European average, and rising (Fig. 16, 17).  This is largely due to higher and increasing rates in males;  these in
turn stem largely from the higher rates of mortality from lung cancer (Fig. 18, 19).  Mortality rates in females are
also increasing, however, in contrast to the European average.<P>

Over the last decade or so, mortality from external causes of injury and poisoning, showed the U-shaped
curve typical for most of the NIS, namely, a decrease that was greatest in 1985-1987, most probably owing to the
anti-alcohol campaign, and a subsequent gradual increase, which accelerated in 1992/1993 (Fig. 20).<P>

<H3>Women's health</H3>
In 1993, the mortality rate for breast cancer was 14.6 per 100 000 in Estonia, below the European average of
19.0 (Fig. 21, 22). Between 1981 and 1992, however, the standardized death rate for female breast cancer in women
under the age of 65 years rose about 15% in contrast to an average increase of about 5% for the Region. This cancer
accounts for 17% of all new cancers found in women; unfortunately, advanced breast cancer comprises 35  40% of
all new cases. The incidence of cervical cancer has decreased but remains rather high and the mortality rate is almost
twice the European average. Screening for breast and cervical cancer and health promotion activities specifically
aimed at women need to be evaluated.<P>

Health services for women are organized according to an outdated medicalized model, with numerous specialized
visits during the antenatal period. Even at this time of financial constraint, this system is systematically adhered to,
and has not been evaluated for efficacy. Under the previous system, women typically visited outpatient antenatal care
facilities 7 - 12 times in each pregnancy, with frequent follow-up home visits. Since this was thought excessive, some
reforms were implemented and pregnant women can now decide the number of visits for themselves.  In addition, the
frequency of follow-up home visits is declining.
<I><H3>Maternal mortality</H3>
</I>For the period 1989  1993, the five-year average maternal mortality rate was about 33 per 100 000 live births,
more than twice the level called for by the health for all target for maternal mortality <I>(11)</I> and three times the
European average of 10.9 per 100 000 live births (Fig. 23). Adequate care can prevent deaths from most of the
reported causes: abortion, haemorrhage and toxaemia (Fig. 24). In addition, the mortality figure indirectly indicates
problems with the health care system in general. An investigation of the causes of maternal death is needed to design
an intervention programme.<P>

<H4><a href="fig23.gif">Fig. 23. Maternal mortality in some countries of the European Region, around 1992</A></H4>
<H4><a href="fig24.gif">Fig. 24. Main causes of maternal mortality in Estonia, around 1992</A></H4>



<I><H3>Family planning </H3></I>
Live births declined from 22 308 in 1990 to 15 170 in 1993: almost 30%. In 1993 there were 169 abortions for every
100 births, up from 132 in 1990 (Fig. 25). The average for the Nordic countries, for example, was around 25 for
every 100 live births between 1990 and 1992. <P>

<H4><a href="fig25.gif">Fig. 25. Ratio of abortions to live births, all ages, in some countries of the European Region</A></H4>



Misunderstandings about the term family planning have prevented changes in policy. Many people have equated
family planning with reducing the number of births, completely overlooking the problem of high abortion rates.
Health education and the training of professionals in family planning vary greatly between different parts of the
country. While these topics were never formally discussed in schools, a new curriculum has now been formulated in
conjunction with the Ministry of Education <I>(5)</I>.<P>
The former practice of charging for contraceptives, but not for abortions, appears to have been reversed recently. For
many years, free abortions have been one of the main methods of birth control in the CCEE and NIS.<P>



<H3>Care of infants and mothers </H3>
Virtually all births take place in hospital. The rate for caesarean section (6.3%) seems low in comparison to the
European average, and that for forceps delivery (0.6%) particularly low, given that the overall service is highly
medicalized. The baby-friendly hospital, including rooming-in of mothers and infants, has been encouraged since
August 1990. There is a shortage of anaesthetic equipment. a)<P>

<H3>Infant mortality</H3>
The infant mortality rate decreased from 17.0 per 1000 live births in 1981 to 12.3 in 1990, and then rose to 13.1 in
1991. In 1993, the main causes of infant mortality were conditions occurring during the perinatal period (47.3%),
congenital anomalies (26%), respiratory diseases (10.9%), external causes (6.3%) and  infectious and parasitic
diseases (4.2%)<I> (2)</I>.<P>

From January 1992, live births were to be calculated according to WHO recommendations. The infant mortality rate
was expected to increase by 20  25% with this stricter reporting requirement <I>(6)</I>. In 1993, it was about
equivalent to the CCEE average but one and a half times the European average (Fig. 26). Many of these deaths could
be prevented. The rate of newborn babies with pathological conditions increased significantly from 109 per 1000
live births in 1985 to 160 in 1990 <I>(5)</I>. The paediatric department of Tartu University estimates the rate of
congenital anomalies in newborn babies to be just under 2% <I>(5).</I><P>

<H4><a href="fig26.gif">Fig. 26. Infant mortality in some countries of the European Region, around 1992</A></H4>



<H3>Children's health</H3>
In 1993, 21.1% of the population was under 15 years of age. According to discharge rates from health care
institutions, children suffer mainly from respiratory diseases. From 1988 to 1990, the three-year average incidence
rate for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in children aged under 15 years was 9.7 per 100 000 for both sexes.  The
figure was higher than those in Latvia or Lithuania but lower than in Finland <I>(5)</I>. These countries are known
to have the highest rates in the Region.<P>
Environmental hazards and the socioeconomic situation in Estonia threaten children's health and wellbeing.
Pollution from the oil-shale industry in the northern part of the country, among other things, aggravates respiratory
problems.  There are an estimated 600 new cases of asthma each year in the Tallinn area <I>(6)</I>. High ingestion
of heavy metals, particularly in the north-east, is one reason for increased baldness among children in kindergartens
<I>(5)</I>. Fluoridation of the water supply is irregular because the machinery is in a poor state. In 1990, the
average number of decayed, missing or filled teeth was 4.1 for children aged 12 years (Fig. 27).  In the Nordic
countries, for example, this figure ranges between 1.2 for Denmark to 2.7 for Norway.<P>

<H4><a href="fig27.gif">Fig. 27. The number of decayed, missing or filled teeth (DMFT) at age 12 in some countries of the European Region, around 1992</A></H4>



The structure of the health examinations of children is being reviewed and rationalized.   Physicians at the Children's
Hospital in Tallinn formerly saw about 4000 children each year; only 2800 are now seen, largely owing to
insufficient transport and fuel for referrals from rural areas and other towns <I>(6)</I>.<P>
The Government intends to abolish the highly institutionalized system of care for orphans so as to integrate them
more fully into society <I>(6)</I>.<P>


<H3>Morbidity</H3>

One way to assess levels of morbidity and access to care is to study differences between countries.  As described by
hospital discharge data, morbidity varies significantly between Estonia and Finland, for example (Table 3). While
differences may be due to differences in their health care systems and need further investigation, there could be
significant undercoverage of the adult population in Estonia. In addition, children's health seems to have worsened,
particularly with respect to respiratory diseases.  <P>
Preventive measures were inadequate in the past <I>(5)</I>. Although classical intervention methods have shown
some progress in reducing common risk factors, the impact on the health status of the population remains minimal.
Innovation is needed to increase the quality and quantity of preventive methods in the current socioeconomic
conditions <I>(5)</I>.<P>

<H2>Infectious diseases and immunization</H2>
Mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases remained fairly constant at just below the average for the CCEE, but
rose slightly in 1993 (Fig. 28). Hepatitis (Fig. 29) often goes un-diagnosed, owing to a lack of diagnostic equipment
and materials<I> (5)</I>.

The incidence of diphtheria, measles and salmonellosis increased between 1990 and 1993.
Officials have expressed the need for a programme of vaccination against rubella to reduce the relatively high
incidence of congenital birth abnormalities <I>(6).</I> In 1993 there were 11 cases of diphtheria, 312 of measles,
23 446 of rubella and 2470 of mumps. No cases of poliomyelitis were reported in 1990 - 1993 and there was only
one case of tetanus in 1993. The incidence of tuberculosis has been steadily decreasing since 1981; it was 26.8 per
100 000 in 1993.<P>
By 1993, the immunization situation had improved. Coverage by type of vaccine was about 80% for tetanus,
diphtheria, pertussis and poliomyelitis, over 70% for measles and 99% for tuberculosis (Fig. 30). Rubella and
mumps vaccines have been introduced.<P>

<H2>Alcohol and drug abuse </H2>
Available data on related problems and unrecorded consumption give reason to estimate that total alcohol
consumption increased in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Russian Federation and most
probably the other CCEE and NIS, at the beginning of the 1990s <I>(12)</I>. In 1993, the annual
consumption of pure alcohol per head in Estonia was estimated to be around 1214 litres, one of the highest
rates in the Region <I>(12)</I>. Epidemiological research indicates that the prevalence of alcohol-related
mental health problems is 2% of the population. Before 1990, alcohol-dependent patients were mainly
treated and cared for in hospital. Since then, treatment has been provided in polyclinics but the statistics on
patients are not accurate. Only limited preventive care is available. There are no data on the prevalence of
drug abuse in the population, but experts estimate that there are 10 000 drug abusers in Estonia. In the
complete absence of specific services for the prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers, the
mental health services provide limited care.

<H2>Tobacco</H2>
In 1992, 19.7% of women and 49% of men aged 16 years and over smoked daily, an increase from the 1990
rates of 15% and 45%, respectively. Table 4 gives more detailed information on smoking prevalence in
different age groups in Estonia and Finland.<P>
Smoking has mainly increased among women aged 2534 years and men aged 3544 years. Some small
local investigations in 1993 revealed that the percentage of weekly smokers among young people aged up to
15 years was about 10% and among those aged 15 years and over about 40% <I>(13)</I>.<P>

In 1990 the number of deaths attributed to smoking was 2400 in men and 300 in women. For all ages,
tobacco use accounted for as much as 26% of premature deaths in men and 3% of premature deaths in
women, or 28% of all cancer deaths. In the group aged 3569 years, 38% of all male and 6% of all female
deaths were due to tobacco. People dying in this age group have lost, on average, 20 years of their lives
<I>(14)</I>.



<H2>HIV infection and AIDS </H2>

According to the most recent AIDS surveillance figures, 33 people with HIV were identified by 30 June
1994. The virus had apparently been transmitted by sexual contact, and three cases of AIDS were confirmed
<I>(15)</I>. The National Centre for AIDS Prevention and the Research Institute for Preventive Medicine
conduct HIV surveillance and verify enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results nationwide. By
August 1992, 800 000 HIV tests had been conducted, covering almost half the total population and about
two thirds of the adult population. The Centre has drawn up a national programme for the prevention of
HIV/AIDS <I>(5)</I>.<P>
After a decrease in the 1980s, the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly syphilis and
gonorrhea, has returned to the 1980 level. This may be due to both changing lifestyles and changes in
notification (Table 5).<P>

<H2>Mental health</H2>



Mortality from suicide in the Baltic States is one of the highest in the Region and almost three times the
European average (Fig. 31). After declining until the mid-1980s, the mortality rate began to increase
(Fig. 32). Officials note an increase in suicide and violence among teenagers and unemployed people
<I>(5)</I>. At the same time, the awareness of stress-related psychosomatic illness seems to have grown
<I>(5,6)</I>. New cases of mental and behavioural disorders increased by 50% in all age groups, from
1014 cases per 100 000 in 1991 to 1565 cases in 1993 (1491 males and 1618 females per 100 000
population). A survey conducted in 1991 showed depressive disorders in 11.8% of women and 5.1% of men
in the districts around the Tartu Psychiatric Hospital <I>(16)</I>.<P>
People with mental disorders receive medicalized care, emphasizing inpatient and institutional facilities. No
comprehensive preventive, curative and rehabilitative care is offered for this most vulnerable group
<I>(5)</I>. The Government plans to reform the relevant laws to develop a mental health policy that will
cover the rights of patients, lay down the main principles of psychiatric care, improve the organization of
mental and psychiatric care and improve the psychosocial rehabilitation of people in institutions

<H2>Nutrition and the availability of
food</H2>

Most of the countries that are changing from a planned to a market economy are experiencing problems in
balancing the supply of and access to food, the limiting factor being price <I>(6)</I>. The nutritional status
of the Estonian population has worsened considerably over the past few years, especially in vulnerable
groups such as elderly or disabled people, families with a large number of children, and pregnant and
breastfeeding women <I>(5)</I>. Diet includes a high intake of fats and carbohydrates and 90% of the fats
consumed are animal fats <I>(5)</I>.<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that the extremely pale appearance of children and
some women indicated the likelihood of folate and/or iron deficiency <I>(6)</I>. Food items previously
imported from other NIS, such as fresh vegetables, are in short supply. The Government issues vouchers for
milk for children up to the age of two years. There is only one supplier in the capital, and many people buy
milk from farmers in rural areas.<P>
Infant formula for premature and normal newborn babies is not available. About 30% of infants are breast-
fed up to the age of three months. The low prevalence of breastfeeding underscores the importance of
obtaining infant formula in the short term and influencing breastfeeding practices in the long term
<I>(5)</I>. UNICEF estimates that US $50 000 is needed to buy milk powder for sick children
<I>(6)</I>.

treatment, is the main source of water pollution. From the early 1980s to the 1990s, the proportion of
samples from the water supply system that did not meet national standards rose according to chemical
indicators, but decreased according to bacteriological indicators (Fig. 33). Many towns and settlements,
such as Tartu, have no sewage treatment facilities and the facilities in others, such as Tallinn, are inefficient.
In 1990, some 56% of sewage needing purification was adequately treated, 36% was inadequately treated
and 8% was not treated at all.


<H4><a href="fig33.gif">Fig. 33. Percentage of water samples not meeting national standards, 1980s and 1990s</A></H4>



<H2>Waste management and recycling</H2>
Estonia has a special problem with solid waste, arising from oil-shale mining and processing, and previous
uranium mining and military activities <I>(17)</I>. Hundreds of millions of tonnes of waste are estimated
to be stored in fills, ash hills and dumps, most of which do not meet environmental protection or
maintenance requirements. So far, the authorities have systematically dealt with household waste only.
Formerly, industrial manufacturers were left to solve their own problems, which were mainly to do with
poor management and the lack of modern treatment technologies.   Reusable timber and plastic waste is still
being dumped. The Government is trying to induce responsibility through a package of reforms imposing
taxes on waste, transferring responsibility for it to individual firms and citizens, and encouraging the
development of a private waste management industry.


<H2>Air</H2>
The chief causes of environmental contamination are the chemical compounds and particulate matter
released in manufacturing and the burning of oil-shale in north-eastern Estonia. Morbidity in children from
respiratory diseases, allergies and anaemia is higher in this region  than in other parts of the country.
Correlations have been suggested with harm to health in adults, especially pregnant women <I>(17)</I>.
Altogether, stationary sources emit about 600 kilotonnes of air pollutants annually. Motor vehicle exhaust
gases contribute an additional 500 kilotonnes. Emissions of hazardous elements and compounds often
exceed permissible levels, owing to outdated technology and lack of purification equipment. Owing to the
collapse of large enterprises and the lack of raw materials and fuel, however, the amount of pollutants from
stationary sources decreased in 1992 (Fig. 34).


<H4><a href="fig34.gif">Fig. 34. Total air pollution from stationary sources in Estonian towns and districts, 1991 and 1992</A></H4>

<H2>Radiation</H2>
The distribution of sources of radiation in Estonia is similar to normal global patterns. After the Chernobyl
nuclear accident, however, cesium-137 doubled in some areas to 4.81 TBq (130 mCi) per km2 <I>(5)</I>.
In the north-east, where bedrock and sediments contain uranium, 5% of dwellings are estimated to have
high concentrations of radon. The full impact of occupational exposure to radiation associated with uranium
mining and processing is still to be assessed <I>(17)</I>.



<H2>Occupational health </H2>
Of the 796 000 workers in Estonia 1990, 33% were employed in industry <I>(5)</I>. The Health
Protection Service is responsible for assessing environmental risk factors and workplace safety in each
county and major city. At least 90 000 workers are exposed to several health risks at work, 25% of them
through direct contact with chemical substances. The concentrations of toxic substances found in workplace
air samples are often 520 times the levels set in the standards, and sometimes even higher. In 1990 the rate
of certified sick leave was similar to rates in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia and the Republic of Moldova, and
the leave lasts a relatively long time. About 15% of sick leave is due to accidents and injuries resulting from
alcohol intoxication at the workplace. The overall impression is that Estonia has environmental problems
found not only in developing countries (hygiene and sanitation) but also in countries in the early stages of
industrialization.<P>

<H2>Health care reform</H2>
Since becoming independent, Estonia has been changing the basis of its health care system from
centralization and state control to decentralization and health insurance. The strategic objective is to
improve the health of the population through the design and implementation of an integrated system, based
on primary care, that emphasizes health promotion, disease prevention and environmental health.<P>
In line with the WHO strategy for health for all, Estonia is developing a service delivery system that
emphasizes the control of avoidable mortality and substantial reductions in current rates of morbidity. It will
integrate the health and social services, the latter being conceived and organized as a complementary
support system at the primary care level.<P>

Among the basic principles underlying the directions for change were:
<UL>
<LI>the right of every inhabitant to health protection, medical aid and compensation in case of loss of
ability to work;
<LI>more rational use of facilities, including more appropriate use of hospital capacity and resources and
health personnel, and the development of general practitioners;
<LI>a more comprehensive and integrated approach to health promotion, health protection, medical aid and
social maintenance; and
<LI>more joint action by the population, professionals and state authorities.
</UL>
The Health Insurance Law on decentralized public health management based on health insurance came into
force in January 1992. It defines the meaning and objectives of health insurance as  follows:  'Health
insurance represents a state warrant system for paying compensation to the people of the Republic of
Estonia for retaining health, paying the expenses caused by temporary disability and health care expenses
and paying compensation in case of pregnancy and childbirth'. The Law covers the organization of
mandatory health insurance, health service fees, the expenses of maintaining health and treating people, and
compensation payments in the case of temporary inability to work.<P>
The Health Care Organization Law provides the legal framework for the health care system and its
institutions.  It defines the responsibilities of the Ministry of Social Affairs, local government and county
and community physicians, and came into force on 1 January 1994.  The Law specifies that every resident
of Estonia has the right to emergency care (treatment that cannot be postponed without endangering a
person's life or health) and to receive an account of his or her health status from the responsible
physician.<P>
Other bills covering health reform that were to be presented to Parliament before the end of 1994 included
laws on:
<UL>
<LI>social welfare, laying down the administrative, organizational, economic and legal basis of social
welfare;
<LI>protection of the unemployed, setting up employment bureau to help people who have become
unemployed;
<LI>health protection, organizing a system of national and municipal measures for health protection and
health promotion;
<LI>pensions;
<LI>occupational accident insurance;
<LI>medicines, regulating the manufacture, import, export, marketing, distribution and use of medicines;
and
<LI>infectious diseases, regulating and prescribing methods for the epidemiological investigation of
outbreaks of infectious diseases, procedures for disease prevention and the registration and treatment of
patients.
</UL>
<H2>Structure and administration of public
health</H2>
Health and social services and health insurance are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The
three major divisions of the Ministry focus on health care and social services employment and income, and
insurance (Fig. 35).  The health care and social services division consists of four departments.   <P>
Under the 1994 Health Care Organization Law, primary and secondary care is organized at municipal level,
individually or jointly by the community or city councils and community physicians. Tertiary care is
organized at the national level by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and county physicians refer patients to it
from secondary care. Patients enter the system through primary care and move to other levels by referral.

<H4><a href="fig35a.gif">Fig. 35a. Organization of the Ministry of Social Affairs</A></H4>
<H4><a href="fig35b.gif">Fig. 35b. Organization of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Medical care</A></H4>
<H4><a href="fig35c.gif">Fig. 35c. Organization of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Employment and Insurance</A></H4>

The Health Care Organization Law introduced a national health council and county health councils. The
national council protects the interests of the population, gives opinions and expert advice on health
problems, helps to prepare draft legislation and regulations and makes evaluations. The statutes and
structure of the national health council are determined by the Government. A county health council advises
the county governor (Fig. 36).

<H4><a href="fig36.gif">Fig. 36. Planned organization of health system</A></H4>

Estonia inherited a social welfare system based on institutional care. This is being transformed into an open,
decentralized system based on home care and relying largely on  individual responsibility and resources.
The present system of specialized inpatient care provided by large institutions will be substantially reduced
and reorganized.<P>
The Health Care Organization and Health Protection Laws provide for a public health network formed by
three main services:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the health protection service, including environmental health and surveillance and control of
communicable diseases;
<LI>the health promotion and health education service, including health education, secondary and tertiary
prevention and health programmes for special groups such as mothers, children or elderly people; and
<LI>the occupational health service (Fig. 37).
</UL>


<H4><a href="fig37.gif">Fig. 37. The public health network</A></H4>







The main public health institutions at national level are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the National Centres for Health Protection, Health Promotion and Education, and Occupational
Health;
<LI>the Public Health Department in the Ministry of Social Affairs; and
<LI>the National Institutes for Preventive Medicine, Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Traumatology
and Cardiology.
</UL>



The national centres are headed by general directors accountable to the Ministry of Social Affairs and
appointed by the Minister. This structure allows them a certain degree of independence. The Department of
Public Health in the Ministry of Social Affairs ensures that their programmes agree with national health
priorities.<P>
The structure and functions of the health protection service follow those of the sanitary epidemiological
services. It has functions in environmental health and the control and surveillance of communicable diseases
and immunization. The National Centre for Health Protection in Tallinn acts as a coordination and reference
centre.  It issues guidelines and supports county health protection offices and national and regional
laboratories.<P>
The National Centre for Health Promotion and Education was set up in 1994. Its proposed functions are the
surveillance and development of health programmes for noncommunicable diseases and for special care
groups (such as mothers and children, mentally and physically handicapped people, elderly people),
including health education, screening and rehabilitation activities. These programmes will be run by public
health physicians at the county level and community physicians at the municipal level.<P>
The national institutes conduct research for the Ministry of Social Affairs. Their funding comes from a
scientific council of the Ministry of Social Affairs and research grants from various institutions. Their main
focus of the Institute of Preventive Medicine is research on environmental health issues. There are plans to
merge it with the National Centre for Health Protection.


<H2>The health system</H2>
<H3>Financing</H3>
At the outset of the change process, the Minister of Social Affairs decided to spend a maximum of 33% of
the total government budget on social affairs, 20% on the social safety net and 13% on health (Fig. 38).

<H4><a href="fig38.gif">Fig. 38. Financing the health system, 1994</A></H4>




The ceiling on public health expenditure, which can be recalculated or reconsidered annually, represents a
fixed sum per year that cannot be increased by additional taxation. Within these limits a health insurance
system is to be introduced. To introduce insurance as a basis for financing the health system, the
responsibilities of the state and of employers and their employees must first be separated. Employers should
pay to the insurance funds a flat rate of 13% that they deduct from their employees' salaries. The central
fund, which is still part of national government, acts as a clearing-house, with duties that include shifting
surpluses in some counties to those with shortages. The state has guaranteed a benefits package.
Unfortunately, the funding for this package covers only 50% of expenditure; in other words, the guaranteed
benefit package costs more than the country can afford. <P>
Community taxation is still very limited, and private insurance may not exceed 0.1%. The insurance funds
pay the pharmacies for medicines per prescription and per prescribed item. Patients pay 5 kroons per
prescription, but all children aged under 3 years and all people aged over 65 get their medicine free.<P>
The insurance funds also pay for all health services to patients, including ambulatory and hospital care.
There is practically no cost-sharing by patients and only a nominal copayment of 3 kroons per
consultation.<P>
The municipalities own the health services and thus pay the maintenance and running costs of all facilities.
They are expected to make all necessary investments in equipment and building as well. In case of financial
shortages, the state may make adjustments.<P>
The social safety net and the social welfare services are funded from the central government budget. When
the new law on social welfare is passed, the social welfare services should be funded by the municipalities.
Institutions at the national and county levels also receive funds from the budget of the Ministry of Social
Affairs. Public health has so far been financed entirely from the state budget. In June 1994, however, the
decision was made to fund public health partly from social insurance on the basis of a rate of 0.5% of total
revenue.<P>
Some 1.4 million people were covered by the health care financing arrangement in 1994. The remainder
were covered from state or municipal budgets.<P>
<H3>Expenditure on health care</H3>
Total national expenditure on health care was estimated at 4.4% of GDP in 1993, an increase over 1990 -
1992 when it comprises 2.7%, 3.0% and 3.5%, respectively <I>(18)</I>.  Under the 1994 budget, 87% of
total funding should be contributed by the health insurance system (Table 7).<P>


<H3><a href="table07.gif">Table 7. Profile of the strategy of health care
financing </A></H3>


<H3>Care delivery</H3>
Hospital care and primary health care are provided at the municipal level. Primary health care based on
general practitioners or family physicians functioning as gate-keepers, assisted by public health nurses, will
replace the current ambulatory facilities and polyclinics.  The health and social welfare services will be
linked at the local level. Community physicians will be appointed to coordinate and organize all health
services and health-related activities at this level, and to control the quality of care. <P>
County administrations are part of the central government. All public health functions are organized and
carried out at this level, coordinated by the county physicians. The health insurance funds are also
organized at county level. These funds purchase health services, including hospital and primary health care.
Utilization rates for ambulatory and institutional care are high in comparison with those for western Europe,
but average for the CCEE.


<H3>Human resources</H3>
At the beginning of the reform process, Estonia employed over 7000 physicians and 15 000 medium-level
medical personnel, too many for the needs of the changing health system. At the same time, the country has
a severe shortage of trained public health professionals, general practitioners and nurses (Table 8).

<H3>Health care facilities</H3>
Table 9 shows the number of hospitals, hospital beds and other health care facilities in Estonia.<P>
In the current reform, some hospitals will be closed, upgraded or renovated and some will serve other
functions. Primary health care facilities based on general practice should replace the ambulatory
institutions.<P>

<H2>Quality of care</H2>
The Medicines Centre has spearheaded reform by stating its aim to "guarantee the use of effective and safe
medicines for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of diseases". In 1992, a rational classification system
of medicines based on the anatomical, therapeutic and chemical classification (ATC), an essential drugs and
drug benefit scheme, a national formulary, and a plan for the quality control of drugs were all drawn up.
The enactment of legislation concerning drugs is being delayed, however. <P>
Differences in therapeutic traditions between Estonia and western countries meant that new scientific
information was difficult to obtain. There are now three small pharmaceutical enterprises in Tallinn: two
joint ventures with Norwegian and Danish companies and the reorganized state producer Vagos. All three
produce high-quality generic drugs.

<H2>Satisfaction and equity issues in health
care</H2>
Elements of the health reform in Estonia that directly influence the satisfaction of its citizens could be:
<UL>
<LI>a free choice of physician;
<LI>the decentralization of administration, which allows the population to participate in decision-making
on the organization, further development and quality of health services;
<LI>the decentralization of the health insurance system, giving people the freedom to take out voluntary
insurance in addition to their mandatory insurance contributions; and
<LI>improvements in the quality of care through the accreditation and licensing system,
<LI>education and training.
</UL>
Since all residents of Estonia have the right to emergency care, and the new system of health care delivery
and financing offers equal access to the entire population, no particular equity issues have been
identified.

Profound and rapid changes are under way in the countries of central and eastern Europe
(CCEE) and the newly independent states (NIS) of the former USSR. These changes have
led to social and economic hardship and, in some cases, to war.  The result is a widening
gap in health between the eastern and western halves of the WHO European Region: a
serious inequity.  A closer look at the CCEE and NIS reveals a particularly disadvantaged
group in these countries: women. While women bear more of the burdens imposed by
change, they also comprise an invaluable, largely untapped resource for the response to
change.<P>
Recognizing both the problem and the opportunity, the WHO Regional Office for Europe
created the Investing in Womens Health Initiative. Its goal is to provide governments in
the CCEE and NIS with information and policy options, through a European Womens
Health Forum. Governments can then use these tools to address womens needs
throughout life, and make use of womens strengths in this difficult period of
transition.<P>
This book is one of the first fruits of the initiative. Coordinators from 11 pilot countries
and 1 pilot city in the eastern half of the Region gathered data for the first-ever country
profiles on womens health and the factors that influence it. This book makes a
comparative analysis of the profiles. It describes not only health status and health care
services but also womens position in society and the influences of daily life and the
environment on their health.  It concludes by indicating the directions for future action
which should include improving the amount and quality of the data on women.<P>
This book makes gripping and vital reading for anyone interested in womens health,
health in the CCEE and NIS, equity, healthy public policy, or the opportunities for
beneficial change in the eastern countries of the European Region.

In the WHO European Region, alcohol production and trade are big business, and
harmful drinking has high costs to health and society. Because many of the problems
related to alcohol use can be prevented, the WHO European Alcohol Action Plan
promotes comprehensive policies to reduce harmful consumption in all countries of the
Region. WHO is producing a series of nine publications to support the Action Plan and
the making and implementation of policies in countries.<P>
<P>
The nine booklets address many of the issues involved in policy-making and action to
reduce harmful drinking and its consequences for drinkers, their families and society.
They cover a range of topics, including:
<ul>
<li>approaches to policy and their economic aspects
<li>taking and evaluating action on alcohol at different levels
<li>treatment approaches
<li>special groups and settings, such as young people, the mass media and the
workplace.
</ul>
Each booklet discusses both problems and opportunities for action in the subject area.<P>

The series offers useful and interesting reading for anyone concerned with health
promotion, substance use and particularly responses to the harm caused by alcohol use.  It
will make an important contribution to the success of the European Alcohol Action Plan
and thus to progress towards health for all.<P>

Monitoring health is an essential task of country systems for
health information and of measuring the European Region's progress
towards achieving health for all. The European policy for health
for all includes internationally agreed indicators for countries
to use. Health interview surveys provide the best -in some cases
the only - means to collect data on some of the indicators that
reflect more recent public health concerns, such as health-related
behaviour and quality of life. The surveys mirror the information
that only properly approached individuals may be able to provide
and ensure the coverage of all subgroups of the population. Yet
they enjoy a long tradition in only a few countries.<BR>

<P>
Moreover, information on indicators is sometimes not comparable.
The methods and instruments of data collection have often been
developed without international coordination, or adapted from
those in use in other countries, usually with substantial changes
to meet local requirements. In addition, countries lacking a tradition
of health interviewing are often uncertain about the best way
to conduct surveys. The WHO Regional Office for Europe and Statistics
Netherlands organized a series of meetings to tackle these problems.
The result was the internationally agreed methods and instruments
for health interview surveys that are set out in this book. These
are likely to become standards, and thus improve the comparability
of information.<BR>

<P>
The book provides practical guidance on health interview surveys.
It describes their role in health for all monitoring, the development
and use of methods and instruments, and the prospects for harmonizing
the surveys across the European Region. It is thus essential reading
for all concerned with planning and making such surveys, whether
in national statistics offices or in public or private interviewing
agencies. It will also be useful to the public health community,
including students and academics.<BR>

The environment can have an important influence on health. The
European Environment Agency (EEA) and the WHO European Centre
for Environment and Health (ECEH) developed this publication as
a joint effort to draw attention to some environmental issues
that have a significant impact on the health of the people of
Europe. It represents the logical complement and continuation
of their cooperative work.

<P>
 Pooling the immense amounts of data that they have gathered,
EEA and ECEH have distilled the resulting knowledge into a brief
discussion of the contribution of environmental factors to the
main causes of death in Europe, and an examination of three particularly
significant issues. These issues meet important criteria. Each
is a widespread problem that causes significant damage to the
health of many people throughout Europe, and all are amenable
to coordinated action that would result in both improved environmental
quality and health benefits within a short time. Delaying this
action would increase the damage and make these problems harder
to solve in the future. This book not only identifies these issues
- air pollution with suspended particles, the microbiological
contamination of drinking-water and road traffic accidents - and
sketches the harm that they do, but lists goals and strategies
for action now.

<P>
 This book offers useful reading for everyone interested a healthy
environment, health protection and sustainable development. It
offers practical suggestions for action to make Europe a safer
and healthier place to live, for today's Europeans and tomorrow's.

<P>
The WHO Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) Study
is a collaborative cross-national research study, designed to
increase understanding of the health-related attitudes and behaviours
of young people. It has attracted a growing number of participating
countries. This particular report gives the results of the fourth
survey carried out since 1982, on schoolchildren in 24 countries
in the European Region and Canada. 

<P>
This publication will be essential reading for health policy-makers,
health educators and researchers in health promotion.
<p>

The survey looks at 11-, 13- and 15-year-old children's attitude
towards and experience of  a wide range of health-related behaviours
and lifestyle issues including: smoking, drinking, exercise, diet,
health and illness, injuries, and school and social life. While
children's use of tobacco and alcohol increases with age, they
exercise less as they grow older.  Many children's diets are unhealthy
and worsen with age.  Injuries from leisure activities are high,
particularly among those who play sports.  More positively, a
majority of students do not usually feel lonely, helpless and
out of things; they reported making friends easily, having at
least two close friends, and talking easily to their mother.
Girls find their teenage years more difficult than boys.  However,
girls like school more than boys do.  The school setting appears
to contribute to the perceptions students have about their health
and happiness: those who are satisfied with school tend to show
positive attitudes in several areas and reported less damaging
behaviours. 
<P>
The implications for health promotion policies and programmes
include: 
<UL>
<LI>legislation on the sale of tobacco and alcohol to young people
should be strengthened and more actively enforced;
<LI>health promotion programmes against tobacco and alcohol should
start early and be extended to all pupils;
<LI>school and leisure-related policy in areas such as sport and
exercise, nutrition and injuries should be further examined;
<LI>the working and living conditions offered by schools should
be improved;
<LI>health promotion initiatives should combine health-enhancing
behaviours and positive experiences for students and should simultaneously
address schools, families and leisure settings.
</UL>



These implications will be of great interest to health-policy
makers and health educators, while the continuing expansion of
the HBSC Study will give researchers valuable insight into how
to carry out a cross-national survey.  

<P>
The report includes appendices on the school system in each country,
the methodology used in the survey and the names of the principal
investigators.

The prime objective of the Healthy Cities project is to develop
city health strategies based on health for all. All project cities
have committed themselves to develop such a strategy before 1997.

Alcohol arouses increasing concern in the WHO European Region, owing to the large scale of
production and trade and the high costs of consumption to health and society.  Because many of
the problems related to alcohol use can be prevented, the WHO European Alcohol Action Plan
promotes comprehensive policies to reduce harmful consumption in all countries of the Region.
This booklet contributes to the monitoring and evaluation needed to make such policies effective.
It is the first of nine in a series to support the Action Plan.  One of the first priorities of work
under the Plan is to set targets, choose indicators and create systems to monitor and evaluate
action on alcohol at the international, national and local levels.  The booklet proposes targets and
indicators - and indicates sources of useful data - for just this task.  It thus provides both a useful
"menu" from which authorities at all levels can choose and a basis for valuable international
comparisons.<P>
This booklet offers useful and interesting reading for anyone interested in health promotion,
substance use and particularly responses to the harm cause by alcohol use.  It makes an important
contribution to the success of the European Alcohol Action Plan and thus to progress towards
health for all.<P>

<HR>

The forms and range of alcohol control by the international, national, regional and local state
authorities vary greatly from country to country and also from one period of time to another.  At
one end of the scale may be seen the system of total prohibition in some Islamic countries.  At
the other end is perhaps the provision of lighter alcoholic beverages in those countries where
wine and beer are perceived as ordinary foodstuffs without many special control measures.  In
many countries there is almost a continuous political debate on dismantling or establishing
different control measures.  The measures used in at least some counties include regulating the
purchase and consumption, pricing, marketing, wholesale and retail sale, import, export and
production of alcohol, and the production of raw materials for making alcohol.  The purpose of
this booklet is to describe the various alcohol control measures that have been used for public
health purposes, and to review research undertaken on the effectiveness, consequences and
conditions of these measures.  Emphasis is placed on legislative and fiscal policy measures used
in alcohol control policy.<P>

The WHO European Alcohol Action Plan notes the economic costs of alcohol-related problems to drinkers, their families and society, and suggests the use of price and taxation policies to reduce them. Further, everyone involved in debates on alcohol policies uses economic arguments to support his or her views. While economic calculation cannot replace these debates, sound data on the costs and benefits of alcohol can give policy-makers vital support by easing the discussion and clarifying the issues.<P>

This booklet - the third in a series of nine supporting the Alcohol Action Plan - shows how economics has been and can be used to assist policy-making. It:

<UL>
<LI>gives a conceptual framework for an economic analysis of alcohol policy;
<LI>estimates the economic costs and benefits of alcohol production, distribution and consumption;
<LI>shows the links between price, taxation and consumption; and
<LI>describes the opportunities to use cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate alcohol policies.
</UL>

The booklet offers valuable reading for anyone interested in health promotion, substance use and the role of economics in the making of healthy public policy. It makes an important contribution to the success of the European Alcohol Action Plan and thus to progress towards health for all.

Europe is a major producer and consumer of alcohol, and alcohol-related problems make a major impact on health, social welfare and the economy. Despite these costs, many communities continue to regard alcohol problems solely as a medical or even a narrowly psychiatric issue.  Community programmes and local action of all kind are one important way of supporting healthier lifestyles, as well as of securing public and political support for modifying the sale and use of alcohol. In addition to the development of local policy, local action can exert a powerful influence on national and even international policy. Every community has the potential for preventive action. Homes, schools, workplaces and health care establishments offer opportunities to encourage healthy behaviour, improve social support, and strengthen attitudes that favour lighter drinking.<P>

These guidelines are essentially practical and contain approaches that can be adapted to different settings. They can serve as a template around which to build the methods and experiences that are unique to particular communities.  They are designed to stimulate local interest and the creation of a detailed local action plan. The book comprises chapters that address specific areas of community life where there are good prospects for developing effective alcohol policies.

<H1>Treatment approaches to alcohol problems</H1>

Alcohol problems and approaches to their treatment vary widely. While alcohol problems exact heavy costs from the individual and society, treatment services must compete with other areas of health care for scarce resources. The need for cost-effective services is growing. This gives increasing importance to one question. What approaches are most efficient and effective in helping problem drinkers to change their lives and reducing the damage done by excessive drinking?
<P>
This well written book answers the question, using the only reliable guide: well designed scientific research. It examines a host of issues  the client groups, goals, settings and staffing of various treatment approaches, as well as their underlying philosophies and theoretical foundations  and clearly states the available research evidence for and against their effectiveness. (Surprisingly, this research shows some of the most popular and expensive approaches to be ineffective!) The book uses this evidence to advocate a comprehensive treatment service, spelling out its principles and main components, which countries can use to build services that suit their needs and circumstances.
<P>
This book provides stimulating vital reading for the planners, managers and providers of treatment for alcohol-related problems at all levels throughout the WHO European Region. The application of its findings could improve the outcome of alcohol treatment and the allocation of resources, thus making an important contribution to the success of the WHO European Alcohol Action Plan and, through it, to health for all.

Despite all preventive efforts, a minority of young people uses alcohol, drugs and tobacco.
While this may not harm the users very much, the inappropriate use of substances causes harm to
society that demands action from all sectors. The question is, what approaches are most
successful in preventing substance use by young people?<P>
This booklet  the eighth in a series of nine  tackles this question by:
<UL>
<LI>examining the literature on substance use and its effects describing various preventive approaches and
programmes in schools and communities
<LI>describing various preventive approaches and programmes in schools and communities
<LI>giving guidelines for preventive work.
</UL>
 
<b>Approaches that involve peer leaders and address the influences on
substance use are the most effective in changing behaviour.  All preventive measures,
however, no matter where they are taken, need reinforcement and support from
society.</b>
<p>
This booklet offers interesting and useful reading to anyone interested in preventing
substance use by young people.  It is particularly valuable to health, education and other
professionals active in this field.  Helping young people to promote their health by avoiding
substance use is an important contribution to health for all.

This report highlights some of the most interesting, innovative and effective activities of
the WHO regional Office for Europe in the past two years. The title summarizes WHOs
approach. Guided by the regional policy for health for all, with its primary goal of equity
in health, the Regional Office has developed new tactics and alliances to meet the needs
of the 50 diverse countries that comprise the WHO European Region.<P>
The report begins by sketching the health divide between the western and eastern halves
of the Region. Western countries continue to show improvements, while social, economic
and political transformation, sometimes accompanied by war, have revived old threats to
health and created new ones in the east. The remainder of the report describes WHOs
response to this situation, its development of methods and partnerships, and its notable
successes.<P>
Focusing on the countries in greatest need - the eastern half of the Region - the Regional
Office, with its partners, has tackled the resurgence of communicable diseases,
humanitarian assistance in the former Yugoslavia, high rates of maternal and infant death,
and the needs for integrated management of the environment and health, training in
nutrition, better training for nurses and health care system reform. Addressing issues
affecting the Region as a whole, the Regional Office has also done valuable work to
promote health through schools, to reduce smoking and drug abuse, to improve the
quality of health care and to help countries use the health for all approach to make health
policies of optimal effectiveness, efficiency and equity. Finally, the Regional Office has
fulfilled its role as an international centre of health information, providing the data
needed to guide its activities and those of governments and other organizations interested
in health. Here its activities range from surveying health in the Region as a whole to work
on more specific topics, such as early warning of communicable diseases and making the
first-ever profiles of womens health.<P>
This report gives an insight into the work of the WHO Regional Office for Europe as it
faces the challenges of working for health in the new Europe.<P>

Everyone knows that the WHO European Region is undergoing profound, sometimes
violent, political, social and economic change, particularly in the central and eastern
countries and the former USSR.  This book tracks the effects of these changes on health
and some of the ways in which countries are responding. <P>
Regular monitoring and evaluation are vital parts of the European strategy for health for
all.  While the 1990/1991 evaluation took place just as the wave of change struck the
Region, the 1993/1994 monitoring exercise could measure its effects on health.  This
book gives the results of the exercise, including a brief and easily understood
summary.<P>
This book is essential reading for professionals, researchers and policy-makers in health
and related fields, and anyone interested in the tides of health in Europe.<P>

The European Community comprises 15 Member States, united in an effort to safeguard peace and promote economic and social progress. It began with the Coal and Steel Community (Treaty of Paris, 1951), which was soon joined by an Economic Community and an Atomic Energy Community (Treaties of Rome, 1957). Under the Single European Act (1986) the Community undertook to abolish its internal borders. The Treaty on European Union, signed in Maastricht in 1992 and incorporating selective opt-outs for Denmark and the United Kingdom, created a European Union combining a Community moving towards economic and monetary union with intergovernmental cooperation in certain areas.
<P>
     The Community is managed by common institutions: a democratically elected Parliament, a Council representing the Member States and composed of government ministers or, more rarely, heads of State or government, a Commission which acts as guardian of the Treaties and has the power to initiate and implement legislation, a Court of Justice which ensures that Community law is observed and a Court of Auditors which monitors the financial management of the Community. In addition, there are a number of advisory bodies which represent economic, social and regional interests. As part of the preparations for enlargement, the Member States have decided to review the Communitys operational procedures in 1996.<P>

Set up in 1949, the Council of Europe is a political intergovernmental organization, which groups 36 European pluralistic democracies. It has its permanent headquarters in Strasbourg, France.
The principal objectives of the Council of Europe are to:
<UL>

<LI>Protect and reinforce pluralist democracy and human rights
	<LI>Seek solutions to the social challenges of today
<LI>	Favour the emergence of a genuine European cultural identity
<LI>	Assist central and eastern European countries with their political, legislative and constitutional reforms
</UL>
The Council works to harmonize policies and adopt common standards and practices in member states. Its activities cover any subject concerning European society with the exception of defence. It operates by bringing together, at different levels, parliamentarians, ministers, government experts, local and regional representatives, youth associations and international nongovernmental organizations to pool their knowledge and experience.<P>
     The Committee of Ministers is the decision-making body comprising the Foreign Ministers of the 36 member states or their Permanent Representatives. The Parliamentary Assembly is a democratic forum composed of representatives from the 36 national parliaments. The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities is a consultative body whose purpose is to strengthen democratic structures at local level. An international secretariat serves these bodies.

  <P>   The decisions of the Committee of Ministers take the form of Recommendations to governments proposing a common course of action: European Conventions and Agreements binding on the States that ratify them; and reports analyzing current problems.<P>
     The European Health Committee is the body responsible for encouraging closer European cooperation on the promotion of health under its various aspects - health policy, preventive measures, education for health and staff training.

<H1>Investment in Health and Noncommunicable Diseases Prevention</H1>
<hr>
</center>
The investment in health and noncommunicable diseases prevention
programme provides expertise in two complementary areas: health
promotion and the prevention of chronic, noncommunicable diseases.
The goal is to increase the capacity of Member States to assess,
formulate, implement, sustain and evaluate comprehensive approaches
for the maintenance and promotion of health. The programme advocates
placing health promotion and the prevention of chronic, noncommunicable
diseases higher on the health policy agenda in the European Region.
<P>
Within the programme, the health promotion and investment programme
focuses on projects for investment for health and <a href="../inv/hps.htm">health promoting
schools,</A> and the chronic disease prevention programme focuses
on the countrywide integrated noncommunicable diseases intervention
<a href="../inv/cindi01.htm">(CINDI) programme</A> and projects for cardiovascular diseases monitoring
and stroke management.
<p>
Within the investment in health programme, the <a href="../inv/aging.htm">aging and health programme</A> assists Member States to prepare appropriate policies and programmes for an aging population. The programme focuses on: maintaining autonomy, minimizing dependence and emphasizing the promotion and maintenance of health.

<H2>Mission and objectives </H2>


The WHO countrywide integrated noncommunicable disease intervention
(CINDI) programme, initiated in 1982, has the overall aim of improving
community health and quality of life by reducing premature death,
disease and disability. It applies WHO's health for all principles
to the specific area of noncommunicable diseases to reduce the
burden of these diseases by controlling their major risk factors.
Priorities include: smoking, nutrition, alcohol abuse, physical
activity, psychosocial stress and enhancing the preventive practices
of health professionals.
<P>
The programme seeks to support the development of comprehensive,
integrated policies in participating countries for the prevention
of noncommunicable diseases and to alleviate their consequences
by combining health promotion and disease prevention efforts and
developing intersectoral collaboration and community involvement,
enhancing the role of health professionals, and making better
use of existing resources.
<P>
Two of CINDI's main characteristics are its use of epidemiological
data to provide a scientific background for health policy decisions,
and the mobilization of health professionals.
<H2>Structure and organization </H2>


CINDI functions as a network of 24 countries (including Canada);
the programme operates at national level in some and at demonstration
area level in others. The aim is to move towards countrywide programmes.
<P>
The key organizational components of CINDI are:
<UL>
<LI>the Council of Programme Directors (the highest decision-making
body of CINDI), comprising programme directors designated by the
health ministry in each country;
<LI>the Programme Management Committee, comprising three programme
directors (on a rotational basis, elected by the Council of Programme
Directors), two representatives of WHO/Europe, one representative
of WHO headquarters and one representative of the CINDI Data Management
Centre;
<LI>CINDI working groups, which cover different areas of the programme,
and include representatives of the countries interested in the
area in question; and
<LI>the CINDI Data Management Centre (Germany) which is responsible
for the management of the core data of the CINDI programme.
</UL>

<H2>Funding </H2>


CINDI is funded in part through the WHO regular budget, as well
as through voluntary donations.
<H2>Resources </H2>


CINDI's resources include: a policy framework agreed by the participants;
a protocol and guidelines for the establishment of the programme
on a national or local level; a WHO Collaborating Centre on Policy
Development for the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases (Canada);
a newsletter, <I>CINDI Connection</I>; an annual publication,
<I>CINDI Highlights</I>; a number of publications and reports;
a very large database for monitoring process and outcome; and
the capacity for mobilizing both primary care and public health
services.

<H1>The Heidelberg guidelines for promoting physical activity
among older persons </H1>
<hr>
</center>

<H3>World Health Organization Ageing and Health Programme, Division
of Health Promotion, Education and Communication
</H3>

These guidelines were prepared by a scientific committee, submitted
to the of participants at the 4th International Congress meeting
on Healthy Ageing, Activity and Sports, August 1996 in Heidelberg,
Germany, and finalized at WHO/AHE.
<H2>Target: older persons </H2>


Physically active lifestyles benefit individuals throughout the
life-span. These guidelines were however developed primarily for
promoting physical activity in the latter half of the life course.
Although much of their content equally applies to individuals
in other age groups, the scientific committee in charge of developing
these guidelines selected those aged 50 years and above as the
most appropriate target.
<P>
Age 50 marks a point in middle age at which the benefits of regular
physical activity can be most relevant in avoiding, minimizing,
and/or reversing many of the physical, psychological, and social
hazards which often accompany advancing age. These beneficial
effects apply to most individuals regardless of health status
and/or disease state.
<P>
Within these guidelines, physical activity is operationally defined
as all movements in everyday life, including work, activities
of daily living, recreation, exercise, and sporting activities.
The proposed guidelines recognize that the preventative and rehabilitative
effects of regular physical activity are optimized when physical
activity patterns are adopted early in life, rather than when
initiated in old age.
<P>
The guidelines focus on the impact of regular physical activity
for both sexes. However, due to historical differences in the
prevalence of physically activity lifestyles between the sexes,
as well as the greater proportion of women in the older adult
population, the scientific committee is careful to emphasize that
the guidelines are universal and apply equally to all. Similarly,
it is also clear that the guidelines must be sufficiently flexible
to be of meaning to a wide variety of social and cultural groups.
<P>
The aim is to provide guidelines for facilitating the development
of strategies and policies in both population and community-based
interventions aimed at maintaining and/or increasing the level
of physical activity for all older adults.
<H2>Evidence </H2>

<P>
&quot;Appropriate physical activity can be fun and is good for
you!&quot;
<P>
Most people who engage in recreational physical activity do so
because it is fun and enjoyable, however, there is ample evidence
to show that physical activity is associated with significant
improvements in functional ability and health status and may frequently
prevent certain diseases or diminish their severity. However,
it is important to note that many of these benefits require regular
and continuous participation and can be rapidly reversed by a
return to inactivity.
<H3>Scientific evidence </H3>


Regular physical activity:
<UL>
<LI>enhances general wellbeing;
<LI>improves overall physical and psychological health;
<LI>helps to preserve independent living;
<LI>reduces the risk of developing certain non-communicable diseases
(e.g. CHD, hypertension, etc.);
<LI>helps in the control of specific conditions (e.g. stress,
obesity) and diseases (e.g. diabetes, hypercholesterolemia);
<LI>helps to minimize the consequences of certain disabilities
and can help in the management of painful conditions;
<LI>may help change stereotypic perspectives of old age.
</UL>

<H2>The benefits of physical activity </H2>

<H3>Individual </H3>


Physiological:
<OL>
<LI>immediate benefits:


<UL>
<LI>glucose levels: physical activity helps regulate blood glucose
levels;
<LI>catecholamine activity: both adrenalin and noradrenalin levels
are stimulated by physical activity;
<LI>improved sleep: physical activity has been shown to enhance
sleep quality and quantity in individuals of all ages;
</ul>
<LI>long-term effects:
<ul>

<LI>aerobic/cardiovascular endurance: substantial improvements
in almost all aspects of cardiovascular functioning have been
observed following appropriate physical training;
<LI>resistive training/muscle strengthening: individuals of all
ages can benefit from muscle strengthening exercises; resistance
training can have a significant impact on the maintenance of independence
in old age;
<LI>flexibility: exercise which stimulates movement throughout
the range of motion assists in the preservation and restoration
of flexibility;
<LI>balance/coordination: regular activity helps prevent and/or
postpone the age associated declines in balance and coordination
that are a major risk factor for falls;
<LI>velocity of movement: behavioural slowing is a characteristic
of advancing age. individuals who are regularly active can often
postpone these age-related declines;
</UL>
</ol>
<P>
Psychological:
<OL>
<LI>immediate benefits:
	<UL>
	<LI>relaxation: appropriate physical activity enhances relaxation;.

	<LI>reduces stress and anxiety: there is evidence that regular
physical activity can reduce stress and anxiety;
	<LI>enhanced mood state: numerous people report improvement in
mood state following appropriate physical activity;
	</ul>
<LI>long-term effects:

<LI>general wellbeing: improvements in almost all aspects of psychological
functioning have been observed following periods of extended physical
activity;
<LI>improved mental health: regular exercise can make an important
contribution in the treatment of several mental illnesses, including
depression and anxiety neurosis;
<LI>cognitive improvements: regular physical activity may help
postpone age related declines in central nervous system processing
speed and improve reaction time;.
<LI>motor control and performance: regular activity helps prevent
and/or postpone the age associated declines in both fine and gross
motor performance;
<LI>skills acquisition: new skills can be learned and existing
skills refined by all individuals regardless of age.
</oL>

<P>
Social:
<OL>
<LI>immediate benefits:
	<UL>
	<LI>empowering older individuals: a large proportion of the older
adult population gradually adopts a sedentary lifestyle which
eventually threatens to reduce independence and self-sufficiency;
participation in appropriate physical activity can help empower
older individuals and assist them in playing a more active role
in society;
	<LI>enhanced social integration: physical activity programmes,
particularly when carried out in small groups and/or in social
environments enhance social and intercultural interactions for
many older adults;
	</UL>

<LI>long-term effects:
	<UL>
	<LI>enhanced integration: regularly active individuals are less
likely to withdraw from society and more likely to actively contribute
to the social milieu;
	<LI>formation of new friendships: participation in physical activity,
particularly in small groups and other social environments stimulates
new friendships and acquaintanceships;
	<LI>widened social networks: physical activity frequently provides
individuals with an opportunity to widen available social networks;
	<LI>role maintenance and new role acquisition: a physically active
lifestyle helps foster the stimulating environments necessary
for maintaining an active role in society, as well as for acquiring
positive new roles;
	<LI>enhanced intergenerational activity: in many societies, physical
activity is a shared activity which provides opportunities for
intergenerational contact thereby diminishing stereotypic perceptions
about aging and the elderly.
	</UL>
</ol>
<H3>For society </H3>


Physical inactivity and sedentary living contribute to a decrease
in independence and the onset of many chronic diseases. Physically
active lifestyles can help postpone the onset of physical frailty
and disease thereby significantly reducing health and social care
costs.
<P>
Older individuals have much to contribute to society. Physically
active lifestyles help older adults maintain functional independence
and optimize the extent to which they are able to actively participate
in society.
<P>
The third benefit is promoting a positive and active image of
older persons. A society which promotes a physically active lifestyle
for older adults is more likely to reap the benefits of the wealth
of experience and wisdom possessed by the older individuals in
the community.
<H2>Who should be physically active? </H2>

&quot;Physical Activity and Sports for All&quot;
<P>
Individuals of all ages can begin to enjoy physical activity at
any age and reap the benefits.
<P>
Regular physical activity has significant physical, psychological,
social and cultural benefits for individuals of all ages, including
those with specific limitations and disabilities.
<P>
There are individuals and groups with special needs who may have
particular requirements which will have to be met in order to
optimize the effectiveness of both acute and long-term physical
activity (e.g. need for special access, reduction of environmental
obstacles, modified programs and equipment). Implementation strategies,
policies, and educational programmes must take into consideration
the exceptional needs and requirements of these populations.
<P>
Specific physical activity needs will vary as a function of the
individual's position along a health-fitness gradient (see Fig.
1).

<H3>Group 1: physically fit - healthy </H3>

These individuals regularly engage in appropriate physical activity,
they can be described as physically fit and can participate in
all activities of daily living.
<H3>Group 2: physically unfit - unhealthy independent </H3>

These individuals are not engaged in physical activity. While
they are still living independently, they are beginning to develop
multiple chronic medical conditions which threaten their independence.
Regular physical activity can help improve functional capacity
and prevent loss of independence.
<H3>Group 3: physically unfit - unhealthy dependent </H3>

These individuals are no longer able to function independently
in society due to a variety of physical and/or psychological reasons.
Appropriate physical activity can significantly enhance the quality
of life and restore independence in some areas of functioning.
<H2>Promoting and facilitating increased physical activity </H2>


There is a need to develop strategies which will lead to increased
levels of physical activity throughout all segments of the population.
Such a healthy public policy can only be achieved by influencing
the following.
<H3>Health policy </H3>


There is a need to stimulate greater appreciation for the importance
of regular physical activity among policy makers at all levels
of administration:
<UL>
<LI>international
<LI>national
<LI>regional
<LI>local.
</UL>

<H3>Educating, disseminating, and creating conducive environments
</H3>


There is also a need to involve a wide variety of sectors in the
dissemination of information on healthy aging and in supporting
favourable environments in the promotion of physical activity,
such as:
<OL>
<LI>family support
<LI>peer support groups (e.g. national councils on aging)
<LI>community and social service providers
<LI>the media
<LI>nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
<LI>self-help groups
<LI>health care providers in primary care teams, hospitals, nursing
homes
<LI>health insurers
<LI>universities
<LI>adult education institutions
<LI>rehabilitation and therapeutic centres
<LI>residential facilities
<LI>private and public sector organizations (e.g. workplace)
<LI>sporting and social clubs.
</OL>

<H2>Implementing physical activity </H2>

<H3>The setting </H3>


It is not necessary to have expensive facilities and equipment.
Physical activity can be effective in environments with limited
space and resources (e.g. home environments). The workplace can
be an appropriate site for providing physical activity programmes.
<H3>Safety issues </H3>


Medical advice may be desirable for some individuals before beginning
an activity programme. Appropriately training at all levels (participants,
trainers, programme planners and evaluators) is recommended. Safe
environments are important (e.g. ensuring adequate lighting, ramps),
as is the reduction of environmental obstacles.
<H3>The motivating factors </H3>


Motivating factors include:
<UL>
<LI>physical activity can be fun
<LI>companionship
<LI>enhanced control over one's own life
<LI>lifelong activity (sport biography)
<LI>improved health status and wellbeing.
</UL>

<H3>The barriers </H3>


The barriers include:
<OL>
<LI>lack of information about physical activity and aging: among
the elderly, among family members, among primary care givers and
other health service providers, and in society;
<LI>stereotypic images of aging;
<LI>low social support;
<LI>inadequate environmental support for physical activity (e.g.
transportation, access, urban planning);
<LI>life history/biographic aspects, including bad experiences
with sports;
<LI>negative attitudes towards sports and exercise;
<LI>imbalance of expected effort and perceived gains;
<LI>social obstacles towards a healthy lifestyle;
<LI>inappropriate social and cultural settings;
<LI>certain medical conditions may require modified activity programmes.

</OL>

<H2>The types of physical activity </H2>


Many individuals have a physically active lifestyle without necessarily
participating in formal exercise programmes. Through usual activities
of daily living - such as working, shopping, cooking and cleaning
etc., one can maintain an adequate level of activity, even without
a high degree of aerobic performance. The first message to be
given to individuals as they age is that they should be active
in their everyday life. However, in industrialized societies,
lifestyles are often associated with a level of physical activity
below adequate levels.
<P>
Structured activity programmes provide ways for individuals to
promote a physically active lifestyle. The recommendations for
these programmes include the following.
<OL>
<LI>Individual and/or group activity, need not necessarily be
performed in supervised settings.
<LI>There are benefits associated with various types of physical
activity including stretching, relaxation, calisthenics, aerobic
exercise, and strength training among others .
<LI>The focus should be on simple and moderate forms of physical
activity (e.g. walking, dancing, stair climbing, swimming, cycling,
chair exercises, etc.).
<LI>Important components to consider in an exercise program include:
aerobic exercise, muscular strength, flexibility, and balance.
<LI>Exercise must meet individual and group needs and expectations

<LI>Exercise should be relaxing and enjoyable. Have fun!
<LI>Exercise should be regular, if possible daily.
</OL>

<H2>Research </H2>


Additional research for the promotion of physical activity in
older persons is required. This implies appropriate levels of
funding. Research of special interest include outcomes assessment,
and evaluation of interventions which reflect the different dimensions
specified in these guidelines.

The need for cost containment, the implications of advanced technology
together and the aging of the population and developing discernment
in service users are forcing the health services to change. As
a result, new philosophies of care are emerging, which include
care being provided in different locations, a wider range of professionals
and empowerment of consumers. The health care delivery programme
focuses on developing policies and strategies that facilitate
the development and implementation of new forms of health care
delivery. Key areas to be addressed include community care, emergency
services, substitution policies (for example, moving from hospitals
to home health care) and <a href="hphbroc.htm">health promoting hospitals</A>.

The lifestyles and health programme helps Member States to develop
policies and programmes on nutrition, alcohol, drugs and tobacco.
The programme has a strong focus on community action  and on mobilizing
primary health care for the promotion of healthy lifestyles (with
an extensive integrated training programme).
<H2>Nutrition Policy, Infant Feeding and Food Security</H2>

Training in the assessment of nutrition status and food intake
assists the development of nutrition information systems in the
central and eastern European countries by identifying links between
nutrition and health. Summer schools on public health nutrition
provide training within intervention projects aimed at reducing
illness and death from diet-related noncommunicable diseases.
The nutrition programme also supports projects combating iodine
deficiency disorders, promotes breastfeeding through the joint
WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital initiative, and encourages countries
to prepare for a nutrition emergency, thus minimizing impact and
preventing famine and long-term dependency on food aid.

<H2>Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco</H2>
<ul><li>
<a href="oslo.htm"><H4>Alcohol and health, Oslo, 1995</H4></A>
</ul>
The programme implements European action plans on alcohol and
tobacco and a special programme on illicit drugs. The programme
maintains a database on alcohol, drugs and tobacco, with information
from all countries in the Region on consumption, harm and policy
responses. A series of publications provides policy and programme
tools for effective intersectoral action.
<P>
The European Alcohol Action Plan was launched in 1992 and provides
a framework for action to prevent the harm done by alcohol use.
The European Charter on Alcohol, listing ethical principles and
effective strategies, was adopted at the ministerial Conference
- Health, Society and Alcohol in 1995.
<P>
The Action Plan for a Tobacco-Free Europe was first launched in
1987 and provides a framework for Europe-wide action against tobacco.
The Charter Against Tobacco was adopted at a ministerial conference
on tobacco policy in 1988.
<P>
The special programme on illicit drugs supports research coordination,
guidance to prevent AIDS among drug users, and training of health
care professionals, especially in the countries of central and
eastern Europe. There is regular cooperation with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Abuse and with the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe.

A working group on alcohol and health, convened
by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, met in Oslo from 9 to 13
October 1995. The group considered the effects of alcohol on health
both for the individual and the population as a whole and some
of the policy implications that can be derived from these. Its
conclusions are summarized below. 
<OL>
<LI>Alcohol is used in most, although not all, countries. The
meaning of drinking varies in different contexts - from cultures
where traditional patterns are occasional and celebratory to those
in which alcohol has played a role as part of the diet.
<LI>Alcohol can bring both benefit and harm to the individual.
These effects can occur in both the short and the long term. Most
of  the scientific evidence about benefits as well as harm derives
from industrialised countries and cultures where alcohol consumption
is largely accepted. Any possible benefit from alcohol should
therefore be considered in its sociocultural context and cannot
be projected into those cultures and societies where drinking
is not acceptable and abstention is the norm.
<LI>Alcohol has significant adverse effects on the physical, psychological
and social health of individuals, families and communities throughout
the world. The effects are felt in both industrialised and developing
countries. The effects are diffuse and costly and are not confined
to a minority of easily identified heavier drinkers. In all cultures
in which alcohol has been freely available both formal and informal
policies have been developed to reduce the harm associated with
its use.
<LI>Alcohol is a dependence producing drug and this dependence
is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
Alcohol is also an intoxicant and drunkenness is associated with
an increased risk of injury and mortality, both to the drinker
and to others.
<LI>Some drinkers report that alcohol adversely affects a number
of aspects of their lives, including harm to health, happiness,
home life, friendships, work, studies, employment opportunities
and finances. These self-reported adverse effects, where the level
of severity is not known, are more frequent among heavier drinkers
but can occur across all levels of reported average alcohol consumption,
although they are likely to be affected by different patterns
of drinking.
<LI>Alcohol consumption can be a significant cause of harm to
the health of others especially in the cases of victims of alcohol-related
traffic accidents and assaults.
<LI>Alcohol consumption is often a significant cause of harm to
the health of family members, particularly women and children,
through family violence and the diversion of financial and other
resources to alcohol consumption and other associated behaviours.
<LI>In research conducted both at the societal and individual
level, alcohol has been found to increase the risk of death from
a number of specific causes including: injury from traffic accidents
and other trauma, violence, suicide, liver cirrhosis, cancers
of the upper aerodigestive tract, cancer of the liver, breast
cancer, haemorrhagic stroke, alcoholic psychosis, alcohol dependence
and  pancreatitis.
<LI>Alcohol consumption has been found to reduce the risk of coronary
heart disease (CHD) and ischaemic stroke, a finding supported
by an understanding of plausible biological mechanisms. The reduced
risk for CHD has been found at the level of one drink every second
day and there is little additional reduction of risk beyond consumption
levels of about one to two drinks a day.The impact of alcohol
on all-cause mortality is affected by the prevalence of different
diseases and injuries, the age structure of the population and
the level of alcohol consumption at the societal level. It is
therefore culturally and temporally specific.
<LI>At younger ages deaths from traffic accidents and violence
(which are increased by alcohol consumption) predominate, while
CHD deaths (which are reduced by alcohol consumption) are rare.
The position is reversed at older ages.
<LI>There is a positive, largely linear relationship between reported
usual alcohol consumption and total mortality in populations or
groups with low CHD rates (which includes younger people everywhere).
On the other hand there is a J or U shaped relationship between
reported usual alcohol consumption and total mortality in populations
with high rates of CHD.<BR>
While probably not invalidating the relationship between alcohol
consumption and mortality a number of methodological issues (including
the presence of confounders, unrepresentative samples and measurement
problems) may result in bias in the estimates of the extent of
alcohol's effect on mortality and the consumption level at which
the reduced risk of CHD occurs.
<LI>Alcohol policy seeks to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol
use whilst recognizing its real and perceived benefits. The reduced
risk of CHD with the consequent reduction of mortality for some
people in middle and older age is one such benefit.
<LI>A number of policies have been demonstrated to be effective
in the reduction of alcohol-related harm, at least in industrialised
countries. These are: enforcement of a minimum drinking age;
drink drive deterrence, particularly the use of random breath
testing; enforced prevention of intoxication in public drinking
places; controls on access to alcohol, including restrictions
on numbers of licensed premises and hours and days of sale and
taxation policy to regulate the affordability of alcohol.
<LI>The drinking population in general has been found to behave
in a collective manner.  Increases or decreases in overall consumption
are likely to result in shifts across the entire spectrum of drinkers,
except when alcohol is rationed. In general, it appears that decreases
in consumption are not associated with substantial changes in
the number of abstainers.
<LI>Because of the apparent stability in the shape of the consumption
distribution in populations, the mean level of per capita consumption
which could lead to the lowest mortality rate in the population
may be much lower than might be assumed from consideration of
dose response effects in the individual. These differences need
to be taken into account when determining alcohol policy.
<LI>The level of consumption associated with the lowest mortality
rate for the population will vary depending on patterns of ill
health and causes of death. In countries with high rates of CHD
the per capita level  may be in the order of about three litres
of absolute alcohol per year among drinking adults. In countries
with low rates of CHD, the level is likely to be substantially
lower. Many countries in which alcohol is readily available are
consuming at a level substantially above three litres per capita
of drinking adults per year and in these countries public health
policy should continue to advise action to reduce per capita consumption.
</OL>

<H2><a name="preface">Preface</A> </H2>


Public policies for promoting health and preventing
ill health are more effective when they are based on reliable
information about the hazards of certain exposures and the proportion
of the population who are exposed to them. Once reliable scientific
information is available and there is a consensus about its public
health policy implications, policies and programmes to reduce
negative health effects can be effectively implemented by direct
government intervention and by forming alliances with advocacy
groups and non-governmental organizations. We have observed that
such evidence-based policies have successfully reduced the health
effects of major epidemics, such as HIV infection and tobacco
use, in some European countries. 
<P>
It was with this need for scientific consensus in mind that the
World Health Organization convened a group of experts in October
1995 to debate what was and was not reliably known about the effects
of alcohol on health. Alcohol is a major public health concern
in various populations, including those of Europe and to be most
effective in reducing alcohol related harm, policies must take
all the scientific evidence into account. This evidence suggests
that alcohol can both cause and prevent deaths. The protective
effect of alcohol against ischaemic vascular disease seems to
be qualitatively established, although its extent remains uncertain.
The protective effect has led some governments to review or establish
low risk drinking guidelines for their populations. While it is
important to provide information on the effects of alcohol, the
evidence presented in this report (and elsewhere) brings into
question the basis for the formulation of these guidelines. Essentially
these guidelines aim to provide the public with the answer to
the question &quot;how much can I drink without incurring a health
risk over and above that of a non-drinker&quot;.  With increasing
evidence of a J or U shaped risk curve for alcohol and total mortality,
the appropriate public health response is surely to encourage
the public to ask the question &quot;how much can I drink before
my risk curve begins to rise&quot;. This is a very different issue
and, as this report shows,  needs to take into account the age
and mortality patterns of the population concerned. Guidelines
also need to consider not only the risks of physical ill health
but also the risks of intentional and unintentional injury and
the risks of alcohol to family and social life.
<P>
Another important finding to emerge from this report relates to
the evidence on alcohol-related harm to those drinkers who might
be considered to be at low risk in relation to their average quantity
of drinking. Public policy needs to take into account that harm
is not restricted to heavy drinkers while recognizing that most
harm among low or average drinkers of alcohol arises due to episodes
of intoxication or heavy drinking on isolated occasions. Policies
to strongly discourage such behaviour in light drinkers must therefore
also receive sufficient priority in implementing the public health
response to alcohol problems in society.

Alcohol is used in many, although not all,
countries. The meaning of drinking varies in different contexts
- from cultures where traditional patterns are occasional and
celebratory to those in which alcohol has played a role as part
of the diet. 
<P>
Alcohol can bring both benefits and harm to the individual. These
effects can occur in both the short and the long term. Most of
the scientific evidence about benefits as well as harm derives
from industrialised countries and cultures where alcohol consumption
is largely accepted. Any possible benefit from alcohol should
therefore be considered in its sociocultural context and cannot
be projected into those cultures and societies where drinking
is not acceptable and abstention is the norm.
<P>
Alcohol has significant adverse effects on the health of individuals,
families and communities throughout the world. Its effects are
felt in both industrialised and developing countries. The effects
are diffuse and costly and are not confined to a minority of easily
identified heavier drinkers. In all cultures in which alcohol
has been freely available, policies, both formal and informal,
have been developed to reduce the harm associated with its use.
<P>
Alcohol is a dependence producing drug and this dependence is
associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality. Alcohol
is also an intoxicant and drunkenness is associated with a high
risk of injury and mortality, both to the drinker and to others.
<P>
The World Health Organization is committed to reducing the global
burden of disease and injury resulting from alcohol. The health
policy for Europe calls for a 25% reduction in alcohol consumption
with particular attention to reducing harmful use (World Health
Organization 1993).
<P>
At the individual level, a basis has been established for understanding
the relationship between alcohol and health through risk curve
analysis, a technique which relates a particular aspect of drinking
to a particular health or social problem. Rather than a question
being put in terms of, for example, 'does alcohol cause cancer
?' or 'how much can an individual drink without incurring a risk
of cancer ?', the question posed should be 'what level and duration
of alcohol consumption leads to what risk of cancer?'
<P>
A basis for understanding population problem occurrence has been
established through the interaction between individual risk and
distribution of consumption levels within the population.
<P>
The conclusions of individual and population analyses indicate
that alcohol policies should be shaped within an awareness that,
except for a reduced risk of mortality from coronary heart disease
and ischaemic stroke which begins at low levels of intake, more
drinking by the individual is likely to put that person at greater
risk of incurring alcohol-related harm, while more drinking by
a population will carry an added burden of societal alcohol-related
damage.
<P>
A working group on alcohol and health, convened by the World Health
Organization, met in Oslo, Norway, from 9 to 13 October 1995.
The working group considered some of the effects of alcohol on
health, at the level of both the individual and the population
and some of the policy implications that may be derived from these.

<H2><a name="2">2. Alcohol and personal health </A>
</H2>

<H3>2.1 Physical Health </H3>


In general population surveys from North America
and New Zealand, health was the life area most often reported
as adversely affected by the individual's own drinking (compared
with five other life areas: friendships; happiness; home life;
work, studies and employment opportunities; and finances) (Wyllie
et al., 1993; Room et al., 1994). A dose-response relationship
was found in both surveys with more than one in five of Canadian
respondents reporting that their health was adversely affected
at an average consumption of between two and three drinks per
day (Room et al., 1994). 
<P>
Alcohol has serious consequences for physical health due to its
potential to damage nearly every tissue and body system (English
et al., 1995). Higher levels of alcohol consumption have been
associated with: oropharyngeal cancer; oesophageal cancer; liver
cancer; laryngeal cancer; female breast cancer; alcoholic psychosis;
alcohol dependence; epilepsy; alcoholic polyneuropathy; hypertension;
alcoholic cardiomyopathy; supraventricular cardiac dysrhythmias;
haemorrhagic stroke; oesophageal varices; gastro-oesophageal haemorrhage;
alcoholic gastritis; alcoholic liver cirrhosis; acute pancreatitis;
chronic pancreatitis; psoriasis; ethanol toxicity; methanol toxicity;
road injuries; alcoholic beverage poisoning; other ethanol and
methanol poisoning; fall injuries; fire injuries; drowning; aspiration;
occupational and machine injuries and suicide. Alcohol's impact
in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is considered
in section 4.1.
<P>
It has been estimated that alcohol consumption in excess of 40g
of pure alcohol per day on average for men and 20g for women contributed
to 2.5% of hospital episodes and 4.4% of hospital bed days in
Australia in 1992. Mental health conditions due to alcoholic psychosis
and alcohol dependence utilised a large proportion of hospital
bed days, followed by injuries from falls (especially among women),
road injuries and strokes.
<P>
Evidence from developing countries has also demonstrated the impact
of alcohol on physical health (Saxena, 1995). For example, in
India, cancers of the oral cavity and oesophagus are particularly
common and alcohol use has been implicated in their occurrence
along with tobacco smoking or chewing. Alcohol-related liver diseases
and alcohol-augmented hypertension are also found in India. There
are additional risks to health that are seen less often in industrialised
countries which arise from contaminants in illegally produced
alcohol (Saxena, 1995; Acuda, 1995).
<H4> 2.1.2 Alcohol and dependence </H4>

Alcohol is a dependence producing drug, with
dependence occurring and leading to significant ill health in
industrialised and developing countries. Dependence on alcohol
can supervene with heavy alcohol use and then perpetuate heavy
drinking with a further risk of associated health and social problems.
Survey data have shown a positive relationship between self-reported
levels of alcohol consumption and reports of dependence indicators
such as withdrawal, tolerance, craving and impairment of control
over drinking  and also when using the ICD-10 diagnosis of current
alcohol dependence (see Edwards et al., 1994). The proportion
of respondents meeting a diagnosis of dependence in US data has
been shown to be significantly associated with the proportion
of drinking occasions on which five or more drinks were consumed
(Midanik et al., 1994). 
<P>
A pattern common to many cultures is a reduction in drinking with
increasing age. If this pattern does not occur, perhaps as a result
of dependence and particularly for those who drink heavily per
drinking occasion, then chances of survival into older age are
reduced (Fillmore, 1995).
<H4> 2.1.3 Injury from Trauma </H4>

Much of the alcohol-related trauma injury
occurs from traffic accidents. The evidence for alcohol as a causal
factor in these accidents is available from a variety of methodological
approaches and numerous studies have found remarkably consistent
findings of a strong monotonic and highly statistically significant
association of risk of accidents with increasing blood alcohol
concentration, an association with a biologically coherent explanation
(English, et al., 1995). Alcohol has adverse effects on human
performance for the many perceptual and motor tasks necessary
for driving; measurable effects are demonstrated at the level
of one drink and the dose response relationship is broadly exponential
(see Edwards et al., 1994). A number of studies have also indicated
that alcohol-affected drivers have a lowered ability to assess
risk in the driving environment although these drinkers are often
confident that performance has improved. 
<P>
Studies at the societal level have also demonstrated the impact
of alcohol on traffic accidents (see Edwards et al., 1994). There
are negative relationships between the price of alcohol and the
level of alcohol consumption as well as the level of traffic fatalities.
An analysis of monthly data from the state of Michigan showed
a significant relationship between proxies of alcohol consumption
and the number of alcohol-related traffic accidents. The relationship
in Scandinavia is not as strong, with more mixed results from
Denmark and a negative finding from Norway (see Norstr&ouml;m,
1995).
<P>
Alcohol has also been found to be implicated in traffic accidents
in developing countries. In Brazil, for example, during the period
1966 to 1975, 25% of the drivers involved in car crashes had some
level of alcohol in their blood and in Chile alcohol was involved
in 42% of traffic deaths. (Pacurucu-Castillo, 1995). Alcohol was
found to be involved in up to 38% of cases of injury from trauma
treated in a public hospital in Cape Town and in 49% of trauma
cases in a rural public hospital. Most of the injuries resulted
from assaults or traffic injury (Acuda, 1995). Several studies
from Tanzania and Zambia have also highlighted the involvement
of alcohol in injuries due to assaults or accidents (see Acuda,
1995).
<P>
Being the victim of assault is linked to alcohol consumption in
industrialised countries. A study of alcohol in violent events
in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada derived its data from a general
population survey, with respondents reporting on the most recent
event (if there was a relatively recent event) in which they had
been victims of violence (Pernanen, 1991). Drinking by both the
assailant and the victim was found to be common in violent events.
This was particularly true for male assailants and victims.
<P>
In the English et al. (1995) review, 19 case series were identified
in which blood alcohol levels were reported for victims of assault.
The majority of these studies came from the United States and
the United Kingdom and five came from Sweden, Denmark, France
and South Africa. A criterion of a blood alcohol level greater
than 1g/L was applied and an estimate was made that in 43% of
the cases the victim of the assault had had a blood alcohol level
at that level or above.
<P>
Injury from falls is another prominent way in which alcohol contributes
to injury (English et al., 1995). There is substantial evidence
that alcohol impairs cognitive and psychomotor performance. A
case control study in Finland established that the relative risk
of falls for individuals with blood alcohol levels of 0.05 - 0.10%
was three times greater than those with no exposure to alcohol
and 60 times greater for those with a blood alcohol level of 0.16%
or more (see English et al., 1995).
<H2><a name="3">3. Alcohol and others</A> </H2>


 In addition to the effects of alcohol on the
drinker there is considerable evidence of the effect of alcohol
consumption on the health of people other than the drinker in
the areas of road traffic injuries, assault and spouse and child
abuse. The public health impact of alcohol on others is of very
great importance and some of the most prominent effects are considered
below. 
<H3>3.1 Injury from trauma </H3>


One such area relates to traffic accidents
where the victims may be killed or injured largely as a result
of others' drinking.  
<P>
Another is the role of alcohol in aggravating violence. The exact
nature of this relationship is likely to differ markedly between
cultures, reflecting as it does culturally formed expectancies
about alcohol's effects and the excuse value of drinking as well
as alcohol's psychoactive effects (Edwards et al., 1994). However,
as with the increased risk of traffic accidents, there is research
evidence derived from different methodological approaches which
suggests a causal link between alcohol and violence (English et
al., 1995).
<P>
There is a large body of evidence linking alcohol with assault
(see Edwards et al., 1994, Room 1995). One of the clearest causal
relationships in the literature is between drinking and some forms
of victimisation.  Robbery and rape can be predatory crimes in
which the intoxicated person becomes an easy victim.  More often,
the violence arises from drinking in a tavern or other context
where both the assailant and the victim have been imbibing. A
national survey in Canada found a corresponding rise in the probability
of having been &quot;pushed, hit or assaulted by someone who had
been drinking&quot; in the last year as the respondent's volume
of drinking rose (Room et al., 1994).  Respondents who drank five
or more drinks in one sitting at least once a month were much
more likely than others with the same volume of drinking to have
been assaulted by another drinker. Even for those who did not
drink this much, the probability of being assaulted by another
drinker rose monotonically with the volume of drinking.
<P>
Five clinical case series from Denmark, Sweden, the United States
and the United Kingdom were used to estimate the contribution
of alcohol to assault based on case histories and other evidence;
here the pooled estimate of alcohol contribution was 47% (English
et al., 1995).
<P>
Important evidence of the link between alcohol consumption and
aggression also comes from the relationship found in time series
analysis at the aggregate level (see Edwards et al., 1994). In
an extensive study of time series data from France and the Nordic
countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) assault rates
rose with per capita consumption of alcohol for all countries
except Denmark (Lenke, 1990). In Sweden the relationship between
alcohol and the murder rate was also estimated and found to be
significant. A series of natural experiments pertaining to Sweden
provide further evidence for the conception that changes in per
capita consumption affect violent criminality (Norstr&ouml;m,
1995). It was demonstrated that a one litre change in per capita
consumption was associated with between a 2-10% change in male
violent criminality. At a consumption level of six litres per
drinking adult, 45% of criminal violence would appear to be related
to alcohol.
<P>
The relation of the amount of drinking to death from violence,
both accidental and intentional, is stronger than any other relation
between drinking and death in many younger populations (see Edwards
et al., 1994 and Romelsj&ouml;, 1995). The extent of the effect
can also be illustrated by survey data. For example, in a general
population survey carried out in one Californian city in 1981
15% of males and 12% of females reported having been assaulted
by someone who had been drinking (Fillmore, 1985). In a Canadian
survey carried out in 1989 reported rates of assault related to
drinking were obtained (Eliany et al., 1992) and showed that 7%
reported having been physically assaulted in the last year as
a result of someone else's drinking. Younger respondents, heavier
drinkers and the less educated were more likely to report such
experiences, while results for men and women were not very different.
<H3>3.2 Health of women and children 
</H3>


In developing countries expansion of the commercial
alcohol market has often coincided with major sociopolitical and
economic change which has resulted in rising unemployment, migration
to urban centres, breakdown in the traditional extended family
system and structures, intense competition for limited educational
facilities in schools, massive price increases and abolition of
free medical care for some sectors (e.g. Acuda, 1995). Malnutrition
and poverty are common. 
<P>
In these conditions alcohol consumption may lead to significant
effects on the health of the drinker's family. Most often it is
drinking by the primary earning male member that affects  the
health of women and children. This can happen through the financial
difficulties caused when a large part of the family income is
used to purchase alcohol, leaving insufficient money to cover
basic necessities. Financial difficulties are further aggravated
by lower wages due to decreased interest in work, accidents and
injuries, minor convictions and deteriorating health, all of which
may lead to a total job loss. Less money also means poor living
conditions and the need for women and children to work for wages,
often in unhealthy and dangerous environments (Saxena, 1995).
<P>
This effect of alcohol on family wellbeing is not limited to developing
countries. Clinical case studies from the United States also suggest
that alcohol contributes to violence against children in industrialised
countries (English et al., 1995). In the population survey in
Canada mentioned earlier, just under one in ten of the respondents
drinking between two and three drinks per day said that their
drinking had adversely affected their home life and more than
one in ten said their finances had been adversely affected (see
Edwards et al., 1994).
<P>
In relation to the adverse effect of alcohol on women's health
it may be that the contribution made by their own drinking is
significantly added to by the effect of others' drinking, primarily
that of their male partner. Approximately three quarters of the
alcohol consumed in most industrialised societies is consumed
by men and the role of alcohol in intentional violence and the
prevalence of violence against women by an intimate male partner
suggest the likelihood of this as a contributor to the effects
on women's health.
<P>
The role of alcohol in assaults by men on women has been reviewed
by Romelsj&ouml; (1995). A study which analysed police reports
on 411 alcohol-related marital assaults shows that both persons
had been drinking in 43% of the cases, while the offender had
been drinking in 44% and only the victim in 13%. In an interview
study of male factory workers physical conflict with wives was
acknowledged by 44% of those who met the criteria for alcohol
dependence and by 14% of those who did not. In a New Zealand general
population survey 7% of women said they had been assaulted during
the past 12 months and, of these, 80% judged their assailant to
have been drinking.
<H2><a name="4">4. Alcohol and mortality </A>
</H2>

<H3>4.1 Individual level studies 
</H3>


There is a consistent finding of a linear
dose response relationship between alcohol consumption and risk
of death from homicide, suicide, traffic and other accidents (English
et al., 1995). These deaths are of particular importance because
they generally occur among younger people.  
<P>
Alcohol has an even greater proportional effect on death from
liver disease and on cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract
and liver. The relationship between alcohol consumption and risk
of liver cirrhosis is exponential, whereas for cancers the relationship
is more linear, but with an upward curvature at higher drinking
levels. These deaths generally occur in middle or older age.
<P>
There are other conditions that are specifically caused by alcohol,
such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy and alcoholic psychosis and others
for which there may be a dose response relationship, such as cerebral
haemorrhage and female breast cancer.
<P>
The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is, however, somewhat
reduced by alcohol use. The reduced risk of CHD is associated
with reported alcohol consumption at a range of from one drink
every other day to up to six drinks per day (McClure, 1993; Edwards
et al., 1994). Much of the reduction in risk occurs by reported
consumption levels of about one drink every other day. The reduction
in risk is not dose responsive, resulting in an L shaped curve,
with no substantial further reduction in risk occurring beyond
reported consumption of about one to two drinks a day (McClure,
1993; Thun et al., 1995). There is some evidence that the protective
effect is greater when alcohol consumption is spread throughout
the week than when consumption is concentrated on one occasion
during the week (Criqui, 1994). Epidemiological studies have not
shown convincing evidence for a differential effect of different
types of alcohol beverages (Criqui 1994).
<P>
The mechanisms underlying the reduced risk of CHD from alcohol
are likely to be an elevation of HDL cholesterol, which is strongly
protective for CHD and interference in coagulation mechanisms,
thereby providing some protection from the thrombotic occlusion
of atherosclerotic coronary arteries (Criqui, 1994). Multivariate
modelling of alcohol's effects on coronary heart disease has suggested
that the effect on HDL cholesterol probably contributes at least
50% of the reduced risk. Alcohol's impact on coagulation mechanisms
is likely to be immediate and since lipid modification in older
age groups produce significant benefit, the impact mediated through
elevation of HDL cholesterol can probably be achieved by alcohol
consumption in middle and older age.
<P>
When examining the relationship between alcohol consumption and
total mortality, the shape of the curve depends on the distribution
of causes of death amongst the population studied and on the level
and patterns of alcohol consumption within the population.
<P>
In populations where coronary heart disease is rare, the relationship
between alcohol consumption and total mortality is likely to be
linear. In populations with a high rate of coronary heart disease,
the relationship is likely to be J-shaped, with the exact relationship
depending on age. In younger age groups, with low rates of coronary
heart disease, the relationship is likely to be linear, whereas
amongst middle and older aged groups, the relationship is likely
to be J-shaped or U-shaped respectively. The exact age when the
relationship changes from linear to a J or U shape will depend
on the  distribution of causes of death, but in most industrialised
countries this probably occurs at about an age of death of 50
to 60 years.
<P>
The studies that have examined the relationship between alcohol
consumption and all-cause mortality have come from industrialised
countries, largely from British or North American populations.
A number of studies have used samples which do not represent the
general population, thereby leading to systematic bias and limiting
the applicability of the results to other populations.
<P>
The association between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality
was investigated in analyses of a longitudinal study in the United
States (Rehm and Sempos, 1995). The study employed data from a
representative sample of nearly 14,500 white Americans (aged from
25 -75) and followed participants over 15 years controlling for
a number of potential confounders including age, education, smoking
status, body mass index, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fat
intake and history of heart disease.
<P>
The study showed a linear relationship between alcohol consumption
and total mortality for death below 60 years of age and a J-shaped
relationship between alcohol consumption and total mortality for
death at 60 years of age or older.
<P>
There have been few studies amongst younger populations. The Swedish
conscripts study followed up nearly 50,000 18 to 19 year olds
for 15 years and found a positive association between alcohol
use and mortality (Andreasson et al., 1988). Violent death accounted
for three quarters of all deaths and increased in a linear dose
response relationship with increasing alcohol consumption.
<P>
A meta-analysis of three studies of male youth (two from the United
States plus the Swedish conscripts study) demonstrated homogeneity
amongst the three studies and found that the significant linear
relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality was attenuated,
although still present when demographic and psychosocial characteristics,
such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, health perception, depression
and lifetime marijuana use were taken into account (Fillmore,
1995).
<P>
Studies of populations with death at middle age have consistently
demonstrated a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption
and risk of total mortality. In the first American Cancer Society
Prospective Study, just over 275,000 men aged 40-59 were followed
up for 12 years and a J-shaped relationship was found between
alcohol consumption and risk of total mortality. Data were adjusted
for age and smoking and the relationship remained when excluding
subjects with poor health or a history of chronic disease at enrolments
as well as those who died during the first six years of follow-up
(Boffeta and Garfinkel, 1990).
<P>
Studies of populations with death at older age have tended to
find a U-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and total
mortality. For example, the British doctors study followed up
over 12000 doctors with an average age of 62 years for 13 years
(Doll et al., 1994). The sample was homogenous with low rates
of current cigarette use. During follow-up, 3328 deaths occurred
at a median age of death of 75. A U-shaped relationship was found
between total mortality and self-reported alcohol consumption,
with those reporting consumption of one to three drinks a day
having lower rates of death than either abstainers or heavier
drinkers.
<P>
The American Cancer Society Prevention Study II (Thun et al.,
1995) followed up over 500,000 people with a mean age of  56 years
for nine years. The results showed, at a median age of death of
70 years, a lower rate of all-cause mortality in men and women
who reported drinking one drink per day compared with both abstainers
and heavier drinkers. Controlling for the main known potential
confounders weakened but did not eliminate the reduction in all-cause
death rates associated with moderate drinking.
<P>
When examining the relationship between alcohol consumption and
total mortality, a number of potential confounders could influence
the shape of the curve, the size of the effect and the level of
alcohol consumption associated with the lowest risk of mortality.
The relationship between alcohol consumption and mortality persists
when controlling for diet, cigarette smoking and the exclusion
of people with existing coronary heart disease at baseline (Boffetta
and Garfinkel 1990, Doll, et al., 1994, Rehm and Sempos, 1995
and Thun et al., 1995).
<P>
Differences in psychosocial characteristics between abstainers
and lighter drinkers are potentially relevant confounders. For
example, light drinkers tend to be of higher social status than
long term abstainers who are of higher social status than ex-drinkers.
Male former drinkers are more likely to be depressed than male
long-term abstainers (Fillmore, 1995). These differences are not
homogeneous across all studies, suggesting the importance of cultural
and historical contexts in these relationships.
<P>
However, when studies have differentiated between long-term abstainers
and former drinkers (e.g. Rehm and Sempos, 1995; Doll et al.,
1994) and have controlled for some of the demographic differences
between abstainers and drinkers (e.g. Doll et al., 1994) the relationship
between alcohol consumption and mortality from ischaemic vascular
disease persists.
<P>
Few studies have been able to address the issue of social integration,
which can itself be related to the risk of mortality (Ritter,
1988). It has been argued theoretically that this is likely to
be lower in both abstainers and heavier drinkers relative to lighter
drinkers and there is some empirical support for this (Skog, 1995).
In analyses which fail to control adequately for this influence
there will be an exaggeration of the size of the protective effect
of alcohol on CHD and a bias towards a reduced risk at higher
consumption levels.
<P>
In general, alcohol consumption measures are prone to underestimation
for a number of reasons. The impact of underestimation (and overestimation)
at different drinking levels is not well understood. A further
problem will occur if there is a misclassification of abstainers,
which is likely to be influenced by measurement factors such as
the time period asked about (Fillmore, 1995). Inaccuracies in
alcohol consumption measures, misclassification of abstainers
and the temporal instability of alcohol consumption could all
affect the observed relationship between benefit and harm at different
consumption levels.
<H3>4.2 Estimates of attributable risk
 </H3>


In societies with relatively low levels of
violence, the numbers of those dying from alcohol-related causes
in the younger sector of the population is low relative to alcohol's
contribution to mortality in the older age groups (among whom
death is a much more common occurrence). However, when looked
at in terms of the numbers of preventable potential years of life
lost the societal impact is seen more clearly.  
<P>
Estimates of alcohol-related mortality in Australia have been
made by English et al., (1995). The method relied on the determination
of the aetiologic fractions of deaths (and morbid events) caused
by alcohol from individual level studies taking into account possible
age and sex differences. A comparison was made between the impact
of higher levels of alcohol use compared with lower level drinking.
The aetiologic fractions were calculated for alcohol use of more
than 40 grams of absolute alcohol per day for men and more than
20 grams for women. The decision to compare higher with lower
levels of alcohol consumption meant that the  impact of alcohol
on coronary heart disease was not included in the estimates as
there was inadequate evidence that the marginal exposure between
lower and higher alcohol intake had an impact on CHD (English
et al., 1995).
<P>
Using these aetiological fractions it was estimated that in 1992,
consumption of alcohol above the 20 and 40 gram per day levels
caused the loss of 3,660 lives (2.9% of all deaths) and 55,450
person years of life (7.3% of all person years) before 70 years
in Australia's population of 17 million. The largest contributors
to the potential years of life lost in this analysis were: road
injuries, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, suicide, assault, alcohol
dependence, stroke, alcohol cardiomyopathy and deaths from falls.
<H3>4.3 Societal level studies  
</H3>

Societal level data provide a complementary
way of assessing the relationship between alcohol and mortality.
Societal estimates have the advantage of not being subject to
selection bias and provide information about the impact of alcohol
at the population level. There have been a number of recent aggregate
level analyses which have examined this relationship using modern
statistical tools for time series analysis (see Norstr&ouml;m
1995). A positive relationship between alcohol consumption and
all-cause mortality has been found in France (1885 - 1958), in
Prussia (1875 - 1918) and in Sweden (1860 - 1913). During these
years the aggregate level of alcohol consumption varied from between
15 and 29 litres of absolute alcohol per adult in Prussia; between
12 and 25 litres in France and between 7 and 10 litres in Sweden.
According to these findings, a 1 litre change in adult consumption
was associated with a 1% change in mortality among middle-aged
men. At an adult per capita consumption level of 18 litres of
pure alcohol, 20% of deaths amongst males aged 35-59 were attributable
to alcohol. During these years coronary heart disease was not
as common a cause of death as it has been in recent decades.  
<P>
Between 1930 and 1980 there was no relationship found between
aggregate levels of alcohol consumption and male mortality from
all causes in Norway (see Norstr&ouml;m, 1995). This may have
reflected the lower levels of aggregate consumption in Norway,
from two to six litres, which could have meant that the adverse
impact of alcohol on mortality was balanced by the reduction in
CHD. An analysis of CHD's relationship with aggregate alcohol
consumption in Norway between 1950 and 1980 was suggestive of
an inverse relationship with CHD mortality in the<BR>
60-74 age group but was borderline in terms of statistical significance.

<H4> Specific causes of mortality </H4>


Other aggregate analyses have demonstrated
alcohol's impact on mortality from specific causes. For example,
an analysis of alcohol-related mortality which included liver
cirrhosis, alcoholic psychosis, alcoholism, pancreatitis and cancers
of the upper digestive tract and of the pancreas showed a positive
relationship between male mortality from these causes and aggregate
alcohol consumption of alcohol in Norway, Sweden and Denmark (see
Norstr&ouml;m 1995). A one litre change in alcohol consumption
was associated with a 20 to 40% change in mortality. The estimate
of the attributable fraction for this group of alcohol augmented
diseases in a country with a consumption of six litres of absolute
alcohol per capita was 70%. 
<P>
Fatal injuries, many of which were due to traffic accidents, have
been found to be positively linked to alcohol in Sweden. The attributable
fraction for male fatal injury in the context of a country with
six litres of absolute alcohol per capita was 40% (see Norstr&ouml;m,
1995).
<P>
Suicide is a cause of death which has also received attention
in aggregate level analyses (see Edwards et al., 1994). Two US
studies reported positive relationships between consumption and
suicide rates both temporally and cross sectionally. Significant
relationships have also been established in a fairly large number
of time series studies (see Norstr&ouml;m, 1995). These analyses,
which have been performed in a standardised way to facilitate
comparisons, include Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Norway,
Sweden and Portugal. There is a general pattern from these studies
which suggests that the higher the alcohol consumption in society,
the weaker the alcohol effect on suicide (Norstr&ouml;m, 1995).
A one litre change in per capita alcohol consumption was associated
with a 10% change in male suicide rates for Norway and Sweden.
A one litre change was associated with a 3-4% change in suicide
rates for France and Portugal. The estimates suggest an attributable
fraction for men of about 45% for a consumption level of six litres
of absolute alcohol per capita.
<H4> J-shaped functions at the aggregate level 
</H4>


As has been already pointed out, at the individual
level several studies suggest that the risk function between alcohol
consumption and overall mortality may be J-shaped. A J-shaped
risk function implies that there is, for the individual, at least
among older adults,  a consumption level where the risk of death
is at a minimum level.  
<P>
It is important to consider what kind of relationship one would
get at the aggregate level, if the individual level relationship
is J-shaped. What would happen to population mortality rates if
the aggregate consumption level increased? This would depend to
a large extent on the distribution of drinking within the population.
If those who consumed less than the minimum risk level increased
their intake, while those who consumed in excess of the minimum
risk level cut back, the mortality rate must decrease.  However,
this is not a likely outcome, for it would imply that everybody
adjusted their alcohol intake so as to maximize life expectancy.
The drinkers who are today drinking at such a level that their
health and social functioning is endangered are unlikely to reduce
their drinking solely on the evidence for a minimum risk level
of alcohol consumption. On the contrary, one could argue that
if a substantial fraction of the population (the light drinkers)
started to drink more heavily, then those who already drank above
the minimum risk level might be induced to drink more, since they
would find themselves living in an environment with more opportunities
to drink. In the psychological literature on modelling, as well
as in the sociological literature on small groups, there is evidence
to suggest such a contagion effect (see Edwards et al., 1994).
<P>
The idea that one could ever engineer society so that an entire
population drank at one uniform level pegged at the individually-defined
minimum risk level is, of course, highly unrealistic and estimates
of potential benefit based on that kind of conjecture are fictional.
Drinking habits vary substantially from one individual to the
next and this would in all probability remain so even if everybody
knew of the existence of a minimum risk level. So in the real
world some people will undoubtedly drink less than any such level,
while others drink more. Thus, at a mean level equal to the minimum
risk for an individual, the mortality rate in the population would
not be reduced by as large an amount as would be suggested by
calculations based on individual risk. The aggregate level benefit
would therefore be considerably smaller than predicted by analysis
restricted to individual level understanding.
<P>
In setting public health policies in the presence of a J-shaped
risk function, it is crucial to make a distinction between the
minimum risk level of intake for the individual and for the population.
 Due to the long tail of the consumption distribution, it is likely
that the minimum risk consumption level for a population will
be considerably lower than that for an individual. How much lower
will depend on the shape of the risk function and on changes in
the distribution of alcohol consumption as the consumption level
of the population changes. In not too unrealistic circumstances
(proportional changes in consumption), the minimum risk consumption
level for the population could be less that that for an individual
drinker by a factor of as much as five (Skog, 1992). In countries
with high rates of coronary heart disease the per capita level
associated with minimum risk for mortality may be in the order
of about three litres of absolute alcohol among drinking adults.
In countries with low rates of coronary heart disease, the level
is likely to be substantially lower. This would imply that most
Western countries are already consuming in excess of the minimum
risk level for populations. If this is the case, then an overall
increase in intake that is triggered by the prospects of health
benefits for light drinkers could in fact result in an overall
increase in the mortality rate.  However, a substantial change
in the whole distribution of alcohol could, if it occurred simultaneously
for example through rationing, theoretically prevent this from
happening (see Edwards et al., 1994).
<H2><a name="5">5. Implications for alcohol policies</A> 
</H2>

<H3>5.1 Risks and benefits </H3>

Policy development is always a process of
resolving conflicting demands. In the alcohol field, where policy
issues are often hotly contested, the conflicting demands include
those of the market and those of the public good. They also involve
finding a balance between the perceived benefits and enjoyment
of drinking and the costs associated with alcohol use. 
<P>
It can be seen from the discussion in this report that the adverse
effects of alcohol use are many and varied and that placing the
reduced risk of ischaemic vascular disease into a broader perspective
is a complex matter. Perception of the balance between risks and
benefits will differ depending on what aspects are attended to.
Relevant to these judgements is whether attention is focused only
on delayed mortality among the older population or on the facets
of the issue revealed by measures of potential years of life lost
and alcohol's impact on community and family safety and well being.

<H3>5.2 Dose response relationships 
</H3>

The precise nature of the dose response relationships
found between alcohol and different aspects of harm is also relevant
to policy development. Some relationships, such as that between
alcohol and liver cirrhosis, show an exponential curve with no
effect on the pattern of drinking. In response to this kind of
dose response relationship the targeting of effective strategies
at heavier consumers only would result in a reduction of harm,
since the heavier drinkers contribute a much larger fraction of
all cases than the light and moderate drinkers.  
<P>
Other relationships show moderately curved risk functions such
as those between alcohol intake and both suicide and trauma injuries
(see Edwards et al., 1994). The majority of these kinds of negative
experiences are found among lighter and more moderate drinkers
(when characterized by volume of drinking over time) because the
majority of all instances of drunkenness (which underlies these
harms) are found among these groups (Stockwell et al., 1995; Skog,
1995). In relation to alcohol-related harm of this sort the targeting
of prevention strategies only at heavier drinkers, even if effectively
applied, would not succeed in minimizing the harm.
<P>
Effective strategies which affect the drinking population more
generally will, however, influence alcohol-related harm when the
risk function is both moderately and very curved. This is because
they have the potential to affect all of the drinkers who contribute
to the experience of alcohol-related harm. If they could be effectively
applied, preventive strategies targeted at occasions of harmful
alcohol consumption would minimize harm resulting from episodes
of intoxication.
<H3>5.3 Effectiveness of strategies 
</H3>

Appropriate response strategies should be
related to an assessment of their likely effectiveness. In general
there are two differing approaches to the reduction of alcohol-related
harm. The first attempts to persuade the individual to drink in
a certain way by the provision of information and advice. The
second attempts to change the drinker's environment to help shape
the drinking patterns and contexts. 
<P>
Educational programmes, when conducted in isolation in schools
or via the mass media, have been found to be ineffective in changing
drinking behaviour. There is a considerable evaluation literature
of school-based education and mass media campaigns almost all
of which have shown no short-term impact on drinking or alcohol-related
harm (Montonen, 1995).
<P>
With far fewer resources alcohol education has had to compete
with messages about alcohol from the commercial producers. The
latter contradict the emphasis of the educational efforts and
are likely to reinforce the cultural and social patterns of drinking.
<P>
A number of strategies concentrating on the drinker's environment
have been shown empirically to have an effect on the experience
of alcohol-related harm. There is a reasonable consensus within
the research community about a set of policies which aim to achieve
environmental change and which have been found to be effective,
at least in the contexts of the industrialised countries in which
they have been evaluated (Edwards et al., 1994). These are: enforcement
of minimum drinking age;  drink drive deterrence, particularly
the use of random breath testing; prevention of intoxication in
public drinking places; restricting access to alcohol and taxation
policy.
<P>
In the light of findings of the reduced risk of CHD it is relevant
to examine the various environmental strategies for reducing harm
in order to assess the likelihood of them influencing drinking
which might reduce the risk of CHD among the older sector of the
population. Many of the environmental strategies seem unlikely
to a have a major direct effect on drinking relevant for reduced
risk of CHD (Casswell, 1995). For instance, taxation policy, a
strategy for which there is evidence of effectiveness, has a disproportionate
effect on younger and heavier drinkers (see Edwards et al., 1994).
<P>
There remains, however, the possibility that even without a direct
effect on drinking patterns that reduce the risk of coronary heart
disease, any decrease in heavier drinking amongst the population
could have an indirect effect on lighter drinking older consumers.
The extent to which a pattern of light drinking for 'medicinal'
reasons among older people at risk of CHD might emerge independent
of the usual social network influences on drinking is not known.
<P>
In large part continued commitment to the population level policies
is based on their effectiveness in contrast to the ineffectiveness
of the alternative strategies available. This effectiveness is
related to the greater direct impact of shaping the collective
environment to make healthy choices easier choices, compared with
attempts to persuade individuals to change their drinking while
leaving the environmental influences unchanged (see Edwards et
al., 1994).
<P>
Any impact of the effective available environmental strategies
on the drinking of older people which might reduce the risk of
coronary heart disease must be interpreted within the perspective
of the competing policy goals in the alcohol arena. In the final
analysis this may be a comparison between an increase in the life
expectancy of the older sectors of the population by a few years
and the loss of many years of potential life of the younger heavy
drinkers who are killed in traffic accidents or as a result of
alcohol-related violence. Another comparison has to be drawn with
the effects of heavier drinking on the family, friends and work
environment of the drinker, in particular the effect on women
and children of alcohol-related family violence.
<P>
While the evidence of an association between alcohol use and reduced
risk of CHD has introduced an important new element into the policy
equation the conclusion to be drawn is that the new CHD data do
not provide an argument against the use of population level policies
known to be effective to reduce alcohol-related harm (Casswell,
1995). Even in those jurisdictions in which CHD is a major contributor
to premature mortality, the significance of these strategies for
reducing the totality of alcohol-related harm suggests that they
remain a priority for effective public health policy.

The health care systems programme deals with health care reforms.
As more value for money spent on health is expected, hospitals
and practitioners must demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness
to third-party payers (health insurance, or central or regional
government). The health care systems unit raises these questions,
analyses the lessons learned and works countries to find ways
to implement new systems to secure health gain. This is done though
country consultation, networking and setting up a knowledge base
for health care systems.

<H1>EUROHEALTH</H1>
<hr>
</center>

In September 1990, the WHO Regional Committee for Europe established
the EUROHEALTH programme for assistance to the countries of central
and eastern Europe (CCEE) and the newly independent states (NIS).
EUROHEALTH assistance aims to ensure health gains in CCEE and
NIS during their economic transition, and provides a basis on
which donor countries can collaborate with WHO. EUROHEALTH emphasizes
promoting self-reliance, building capacity and strengthening management
support.

<P>
The EUROHEALTH priorities are:
<UL>
<LI>health policy
<LI>health care reforms
<LI>women's and children's health
<LI>control of communicable diseases
<LI>control of noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of better
health
<LI>environment and health
</UL>


The programme's main functions are:
<UL>
<LI>to draw up, coordinate and monitor implementation of medium-term
programmes of cooperation between the CCEE and NIS and WHO/Europe;
<LI>to manage WHO offices in countries (currently 24 WHO Liaison
Offices and some 4-5 public health advisers/health policy advisers);
<LI>to manage the WHO European <a href="ismsmain.htm">Information Service on Medical
Supplies</A>, a service that collects and analyses data on needs for
medical supplies from some CCEE and NIS;
<LI>to manage the WHO fellowships programme.

The sexual and family health team provides technical assistance
and information on all aspects of women's issues, maternal and
child health and reproductive health; the aim is to enable Member
States to build national family planning programmes and services
suited to their circumstances and needs. Through country projects,
financed mainly by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
but also by WHO and other donors, the team focuses on the countries
in greatest need of good family planning services: those with
high rates of abortion and maternal illness and death. The team
produces information for family planning professionals, for example,
through the production of the European family planning magazine,
<I>Entre nous</I>.

</center>
The epidemiology, statistics and health information programme
helps to make existing health and health-related information more
widely known, accessible and used in support of health policy
formulation, and the planning, monitoring and management of health
services. An important tool is the regularly updated <a href="../../country/country.htm">health for
all statistical indicator database</A>, which is available on diskette
and the Internet. Others are triennial reports evaluating progress
towards the regional targets for health for all and highlights
on health in countries.
<P>
The programme helps Member States, particularly the those in the
eastern half of the Region, make better use of routinely collected
health data at national and subnational levels, and works with
Member States and other international organizations to improve
comparability of data.

<H2>Quality of Care and Technologies
</H2>
The quality of care and technologies programme concentrates on
improving the outcome of health care in Member States through
the continuous development of quality of care. At present, it
focuses on:
<UL>
<LI>the prevention of late complications in diabetes mellitus,
implemented in all Member States through the St Vincent Action
Programme;
<LI>perinatal care, with a database with over 4 million births
from 39 countries;
<LI>the development of national policies for quality of care in
at least 15 countries; and
<LI>a preventive programme in oral health care, mainly targeting
schoolchildren.
</UL>
<H2>Pharmaceuticals</H2>

The programme for pharmaceuticals assists Member States, particularly
those in the eastern half of the Region, to develop and implement
national drug policies. The aim is to ensure access to essential
drugs for the whole population at an affordable cost to the individual
and the society, while promoting the rational use of drugs. The
programme focuses on drug regulation, strategies for rational
drug use, schemes for financing of pharmaceuticals and logistical
aspects, pharmacy practice and the development of human resources
in the pharmaceutical sector.

</center>
The communicable diseases programme helps countries to develop
effective programmes for surveillance and prevention of emerging,
re-emerging and other communicable diseases. The focus is on programmes
in the countries of central and eastern Europe (CCEE) and the
newly independent states (NIS) of the former USSR.
<P>
The programme provides the secretariat for the Interagency Immunization
Coordinating Committee (IICC - involving about a dozen agencies
and countries), which coordinates donor support aimed at ensuring
primary immunization in children, disease control through immunization,
and vaccine self-sufficiency in the NIS. Other priority areas
include: the eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000, and
the struggle against AIDS and the recent upsurge of other sexually
transmitted diseases in the NIS, tuberculosis, and diarrhoeal
diseases and acute respiratory infections.

<HR>

<P>
The <A href="../../tech/hcp/index.htm"><B>Healthy Cities</B></A> programme
provides guidance on urban health at the national and local levels
and coordinates the Healthy Cities project, which supports the
network of 35 participating cities and the 23 national networks
(with about 500 cities) in the European Region. Healthy cities
implement the health for all strategy at the local level. They
emphasize equity, sustainability, multisectoral action and community
participation. The project cities act as field laboratories. The
programme collects and analyses their experience, and disseminates
to other project cities and the national networks. The Healthy
Cities project cooperates with the European Union campaign for
sustainable cities and towns.
<H2>Public Health Infrastructures </H2>

<P>
The programme to develop public health infrastructures:
<UL>
<LI>aims to disseminate an understanding of the role and potential
of a modern public health infrastructure;
<LI>is developing a template to assess the public health action
at the national and local levels.
</UL>

<P>
This helps policy-makers identify strengths and weaknesses in
the development of their public health infrastructures.
<H2>Country Health Policies and Equity in health </H2>

<P>
This programme supports countries in developing intersectoral
policies for health, with clear objectives and targets, and based
on principles of equity and participation in decision-making.
Its consultation and advisory services provide tailor-made support,
building on local assets, expertise and structures as far as possible
to ensure effective and sustainable processes for policy development.
The programme provided information on what works and what does
not through publications, policy reviews and analysis. It develops
tools for decision-makers, including discussion papers that use
easily understood language to clarify the concept of equity in
health, how to measure it, and policies and strategies that promote
a fair chance for all.
<H2>Regions for Health Network </H2>

<P>
The aim of <A href="region01.htm"><B>the Regions for Health Network</B></A>
rapidly growing network, which already has more than 20 members,
is to develop the health for all policy at the level of regions
and, through networking, to facilitate an exchange of information,
know-how and mutual support for this purpose. Information exchange
is secured through a newsletter, electronic mail links, regular
meetings, on-site visits, training seminars and the <B>&quot;Leading
Edge&quot; series (<a href="edge1.pdf">No. 1</A> and <a href="edge2.pdf"> No. 2</A>) (in Acrobat format)</B> of documents, describing innovative
activities.
<H2>Health Care Policies and Systems </H2>

<P>
The health care policies and systems programme was established
in 1994. It aims to build capacity in country health care reforms,
to develop health care policy, to offer technical advice and to
help countries coordinate their reform efforts. To achieve these
aims, initiatives are developed at three levels: Region-wide,
sub-Regional and national.
<P>
Region-wide work deals with issues concerning all countries such
as contracting in health services to increase the chances of modifying
health care systems towards more rational infrastructures oriented
to health gain. Some initiatives respond to the requests of groups
of countries, such as the establishment of the Central Asian Republics'
Network for Health Care Financing and Management (CARNET). Work
in countries includes: programmes for health care reform in Kyrgyzstan
(the MANAS Health Care Reform Programme) and Turkmenistan (the
Lukman Health Programme) and the health reform and reconstruction
programme in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which WHO/Europe leaders
the Health Sector Task Force.

New systems of health care delivery require health professionals
to perform new tasks and functions. This demands a reorientation
of current practice and appropriate education. The human resources
development programme is developing educational policies and materials
for nurses and physicians focusing on primary health care services
with a multidisciplinary perspective. A charter of general practice
will provide the guiding principles in developing general practice/family
medicine.

<h1>Overview</H1>
<hr>
</center>
The Swiss health system is based on a federalistic structure characterized by a complex
division of responsibilities between the federal and cantonal authorities on one hand, and
the private sector on the other hand.<P>
In Switzerland, there is no Ministry of Health at federal level. The Federal Office of 
Public Health (FOPH) and the Federal Social Insurance Office are part of the Federal 
Department (Ministry) of the Interior. Depending on the canton in question, one or several
Departments are responsible for health. The Conference of Cantonal Directors of Health
Affairs (CDS), which acts as an intercantonal coordinator, deals, among others, with
problems relating to the planning and management of the health system which are
common to all the cantons.<P>
The decentralized, federal structure of the Swiss health system, explains why there is no
single body responsible for health service provision and planning <i>(Sommer 1987).</i> The
private sector plays a very significant role, without however observing purely market
economy rules. Some authors have referred to a "paradox of ungovernability and efficacy"
of the Swiss health system in this context (Lehmann et al. 1989).<P>


<H2>Making health for all a reality</H2>
<H3>Strengths of the health care system</H3>
<UL>
<LI>From 1980 to 1990, Switzerland's position among the other European countries
improved on almost all health indicators.
<LI>Life expectancy at birth is the second highest in Europe and has risen 4.6 years over
the last two decades. Life expectancy free from disability is 67 years for males and 73
years for females. Considerable progress has been made with respect to the health of
people aged 65 and  over.
<LI>Excellent progress has been made in reducing mortality due to cardiovascular
disease. In particular, a drastic reduction in cerebrovascular mortality has taken place.
<LI>Progress has also been made in reducing the relative incidence of motor vehicle
traffic accidents and mortality due to certain types of cancer.
<LI>Although federal authorities lack the formal competence to adopt a national HFA
strategy, HFA principles are increasingly being taken into account at cantonal level.
<LI>National health promotion/prevention policies and strategies have been established
by the Federal Office of Public Health (AIDS,'drugs, alcohol and tobacco) and the Swiss
Foundation for Health Promotion (health at the workplace, adolescent health and cancer
prevention).
<LI>Professionals, patients, policymakers and experts tend to agree that quality care is
available for everyone from birth to death throughout the country. There are no waiting
lists or rationing; there are, however, indications of over-and under-utilization.
<LI>The first Swiss Health Report <i>(Weiss 1993)</I> is currently in the course of publication
and major efforts are underway to strengthen the Swiss health information system.
</UL>



<H2>Pointers for action
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Social Inequality in health status and life expectancy is still considerable.
<LI>The rate of suicide and self-inflicted injury not only remains some 30% above the
European average, but Switzerland's position has also  deteriorated in comparison with
other European countries. Public awareness of this societal phenomenon should be
promoted and appropriate prevention programmes targeted at adolescents set up.
<LI>Although the role of the family is well recognized, there is no central strategy,
programme or organization in Switzerland aimed at fostering the health supporting
functions of the family.
<LI>Between 1975 and 1990, health costs increased at a much faster rate than
GDP. Compared to other European countries, Switzerland's overall spending on health is
average as a percentage:of its GDP, but highest per capita. As health care costs are rising,
they are becoming an increasing burden on household budgets, particularly in the low-
and middle-income brackets :
<LI>Whereas:there is a shortage of nurses of Swiss nationality, the number of doctors
continues to grow. Since the early 1970s, the number of physicians has almost doubled. In
1990 there was a practising physician for 340 inhabitants.
<LI>As doctors in private practice are gatekeepers of the health system, their growing
numbers are at least partially responsible for a supply-induced demand and consequently
the spiralling costs of health care as a whole.
<LI>The average length of stay in acute care hospitals -13 days- is considerably higher
than in other European countries, partially due to the lack of adequate outpatient facilities.
<LI>Financial coverage favours the expansion of care in both hospitals and private
doctors' surgeries. Preventive counselling, outpatient home care and social services for the
handicapped and chronically ill -though expanding- remain underdeveloped.
<LI>Fragmentation of responsibility and the strong position of both health insurance
companies and the medical establishment make the design and implementation of
fundamental reforms extremely difficult.
<LI>Despite growing awareness of the need for health promotion and disease prevention,
only very limited resources are allocated to this area. The creation of the Swiss Foundation
for Health Promotion in l989, the very successful Swiss AIDS prevention strategy and the
establishment of many new health promotion programmes at cantonal and community
levels are steps in the right direction.

<UL>
<LI>In 1990, foreign nationals constituted 18.1% of the resident Swiss population. In a few cantons this
percentage is much higher: 36.6% in Geneva, 25.6% in Ticino and 25.4% in Vaud.
</UL>
<H3>Language</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Switzerland is a multilingual society divided into three major linguistic regions: German, French and
Italian speaking.
<LI>Swiss residents think and speak predominantly in one of the four national languages: German (63.6%),
French (19.2%), Italian (7.6%) and Rhaeto-Romanic (0.6%), other (8.9%).
<LI>Other languages widely spoken: Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and English.

<LI>The resident population is almost equally Roman Catholic (47.6%) or Protestant (44.3%), but with
great variations from canton to canton. The remaining belong principally to other Christian denominations
(3.2%) and 4.9% indicate no religious affilialion.

<H3>Population                 </H3>
<UL>
<LI>In 1990, the total resident population was 6 873 700 (foreign nationals: 1 246 600).
<LI>The steady growth of the Swiss resident population is due to the following factors:
<UL>
<LI>a still significant proportion of women in child bearing age groups;
<LI>a continued increase in life expectancy;
<LI>a strongly positive migratory balance.
</UL>
<LI>Over the last decades the number of people at the age of retirement and of persons of very old age has
considerably increased. At the same time the number of young people has decreased in absolute numbers and
in proportion to the population as a whole.
</UL>
<H3>Family and Households                   </H3>
<UL>
<LI>While marriage rates have been stable since the 1960s, first marriages are concluded at increasingly
later ages.
<LI>The divorce rate is increasing: 34% in 1990 versus 15% in 1970.
<LI>Between 1860 and 1980, the number of households has increased at double the rate of the population;
as a consequence, the average household size has decreased from 4 persons in 1930 to 2.5 persons in 1980.
<LI>In 1980, 42.3% of the 2 449 800 households were family households with children (11.6% of which
were headed by a single parent comprising about 10% of children and youngsters below 20 years of age).
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Education                   </H3>
<UL>
<LI>The educational level of the Swiss population has steadily increased over successive generations: the
proportion of people having received only basic education has decreased from 57% to 19% over the last thirty years;
<LI>Less than 10% of people in the 30 to 65 year age range hold a university degree. In all age groups men
have received a higher level of formal education as compared to women; however, the admission rates of
women into higher educational institutions are improving rapidly.

<H3>Politics                   </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Switzerland is a federal state comprising 26 cantons. The Federal Assembly (Parliament) is composed
of two Chambers: the National Council (220 members) and the Council of States (46 members). The federal
government has 7 members elected by the Federal Assembly, one of the seven is elected President of the
Swiss Confederation each year and for one year.
<LI>The main political power is in the hands of the people. Any change in the Swiss Constitution has to be
accepted by the Swiss people and the majority of the cantons (mandatory referendum). By the rights of
optional referenda and initiatives, almost any issue may be submitted to popular vote.
<LI>Switzerland is a member of EFTA and submitted its candidacy to the European Community in 1992.

<LI>Health costs are an ever increasing percentage of the Gross Domesic Product (GDP): 3.3% in 1960, 7% in 1975 and 8.4% in 1990.
<LI>The intenational comparison shows that Swiss health expenditure is in line with what can be expected on the basis of its economic wealth.
<LI>While accidents and disabilities are covered by central public institutions, about 270 private companies share the sickness insurance market. Nearly every resident in Switzerland is affiliated to such a company on a voluntary basis.
<LI>Public subsidies benefit mainly hospitals and to a lesser extent institutions for the elderly and home care.
<LI>Households contribute directly (cash payments and mandatory 10 percent co-payment on ambulatory care bills) or indirectly (insurance fees) approximately two-thirds of total health costs.
<LI>Since the mid-1970s,diminishing public subsidies and raising health care costs have put an increasing
burden on households, particularly for those in the low and middle income brackets.

<H2>Trends in cardiovascular mortality </H2>
In Switzerland, age and sex standardized death rates (SDR) from diseases of the circulatory system (ages 0-
64 years) are traditionally well below the average of the European Region (second best position). <P>
Nevertheless, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death (40.2% of all male deaths and 47.8% of
all female deaths in 1990). Cardiovascular mortality rates have been decreasing over the last 20 years:

<H2>Risk factors</H2>

<P>
Switzerland ranks quite favourably with regard to risk factors in cardiovascular mortality <I>(Weiss 1993).</I><P>
<H3><a href="monic1a.gif">Smoking</A></H3>
In 1990, about 34% of Swiss people above 15 years of age smoked regularly (males: 39%; females:
29%). Over the last decade the proportion of regular smokers has significantly declined among males (-5%)
and has remained constant among females. There has been no favourable trend in heavy smoking (20
cigarettes or more per day): stable at around 20% for males and an increase of 8 to 12% for females.<P>
<H3><a href="monic1c.gif">Serum Cholesterol</A></H3>
The proportion of people with high serum cholesterol levels (&gt 6.5 mmol/l) increases with age. Data taking
into account HDL, show that males are at highest risk at the age of 45 to 54 years and that females are at
lower risk at all ages.<P>
<H3><a href="monic1b.gif">Body Mass Index</A></H3>
Weight excess (Body Mass Index &gt =30) increases significantly with age for both sexes. For all ages, the
proportion of people with normal weight (BMI&lt 25) is higher among females than males.<P>
<H3><a href="monic1d.gif">Blood Pressure</A></H3>
The proportion of people with high systolic blood pressure (&gt = 160 mmHG) is rather low if compared to
other European countries. For both sexes, this proportion increases with age, but is smaller for females than
males, at all ages.

Malignant neoplasms constitute the second leading cause of death in Switzerland: 28% of all male deaths and
24% of all female deaths in 1990. More than 80% of all deaths by cancer concern men and women aged 60
or more.<P>
Over the last 20 years, mortality rates due to malignant neoplasms under age 65 have considerably decreased
among men. This significant change is mostly due to the flattening of the epidemic of lung and other tobacco
related cancers and the persisting favourable trend in cancer of the stomach.<P>

elsewhere in Europe.


<H3><a href="cervix.gif">Mortality from cancer of cervic & breast, females, 0-64 years</A>    </H3>
In the 1970's, Swiss mortality rates from breast cancer were about 20% higher than the European average. In

European countries. The current rate is about 30% below the European average.                   <P>

There has been a substantial reduction in mortality from external causes, but the Swiss rate remains
consistently higher than the European average.          <P>

accidents and suicide.                   <P>
<H3><a href="traffic.gif">Mortalitry from motor vehicle traffic accidents
</A></H3>
As in other countries of the European Region, standardized mortality from motor vehicle traffic accidents
has been falling slowly. This decline is even more impressive if one takes into consideration the
simultaneous increase in motor vehicles and road traffic. In 1990, close to 1 000 people were killed and 30
000 injured.               <P>
<H3><a href="suic.gif">Mortality from suicide & self-inflicted injury
</A> </H3>
Mortality from suicide and self-inflicted injury steadily increased during the 1970s, levelled off in the early
1980s and has shown a slight downward trend since then. Switzerland still has one of the highest suicide
rates in the European Region. Prevention efforts in this area should be given high priority.

<H2>Health promotion
 </H2>
Up to the early 1980s, the activity of public bodies (Confederation and Cantons) was limited to traditional
tasks of public hygiene such as surveillance of food quality, vaccinations, etc. Health education was carried
out by private agencies in the areas of road accident prevention, alcohol, cancer. In 1982/83, on the basis of
their competence in the area of public health, the cantons rejected the introduction of a federal law on health
prevention. A number of initiatives have nevertheless been taken at the national level:
<UL>
<LI>In 1983 and 1986, the Swiss Society for Social and Preventive Medicine elaborated a concept "Health
Promotion and Prevention in Switzerland" recommending the creation of a prevention unit at the Federal
Office of Public Health and the establishment of a special fund for health promotion. Both these
recommendations have  been followed.
<LI>The Swiss Foundation for Health Promotion was created in 1989 by the Cantons, the Confederation, the
Swiss association of private insurance companies and the Federation of health insurance companies. Despite
a very modest annual budget of some 2.4 million Swiss francs, a number of projects have already been
subsidised (prevention in the areas of alcoholism, smoking, sexual abuse of children, health education). The
Foundation has just issued proposals for a concerted national action in the field of health promotion for the
years 1993-97. National priority topics approved by all relevant public and private institutions are: health at
the work place, adolescent health and cancer prevention.
<LI>The Confederation focuses its activities on infectious diseases, AIDS, illegal drugs, tobacco and
alcohol. In particular, the Confederation has funded the well-known national STOP AIDS campaign since
1987 and another national campaign aimed at the prevention of illicit drug use since 1992.

Despite growing awareness of the need for health promotion and disease and accident prevention, only very

<LI>Fat represents about 42% of the total energy intake. This proportion lies well above the European
average (36%) and has not changed over the last two decades.

<H2>Exercise and sport
</H2>
For Switzerland as a whole, there are no recent data available regarding physical exercise and the practice of
sports. Partial results from local studies tend to indicate that 30 to 40% of young adults get enough exercise
from a prevention point of view, while 70% of people between 55 and 74 years lack sufficient exercise. <P>

<LI>Weekly practice of a sport has considerably increased since the late 1970s.
<LI>While gender differences tend to narrow, the percentage of those practising a sport at least once a week
is much lower among people older than 45 years.
<LI>Among adolescents (16 to 19 years), 58% of boys and 46% of girls practise a sport regularly
(Müller/Béroud 1987); these proportions appear to be somewhat smaller than the ones observed in other
European countries <I>(Aaro/Wold 1987).</I>
</UL>
<hr>
<H2>Tobacco consumption</H2>
<H3><a href="cigar.gif">Annual cigarette consumption
</A></H3>
<UL>
<LI>In 1990, an estimated 1.7 million Swiss people smoked, that is about 34% of the population above 15
years of age smoke regularly (males: 39%; females: 29%).
<LI>Over the last decade the proportion of regular smokers has significantly declined among males (-5%)
and has remained constant among females.
<LI>There has been no favourable trend in heavy smoking (20 cigarettes or more per day): stability around
20% for males and increase from 8 to 12% for females.
</UL>
<P>
TV advertising is prohibited and no smoking zones have been progressively introduced in public places
(restaurants, hospitals, public administrations). <P>
Since 1992, a national campaign under the slogan "New pleasure without tobacco" has been launched and
aims at preventing youngsters from starting and helping women to give up smoking.



<hr>

<H2>Alcohol consumption
</H2>
<H3><a href="alcoh.gif">Annual pure alcohol consumption
</A></H3>
Despite the fact that Switzerland ranks very high on alcohol consumption, there appear to be fewer
consecutive problems than elsewhere (low mortality rate by cirrhosis of the liver, moderate social
marginality). At least inpart, this may be explained by the fact that moderate alcohol consumption is
culturally acceptable, by strong social control and widespread medical treatment of alcoholic illness. <P>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol consumption in Switzerland (11 litres of pure alcohol per person) is about twice the European
regional average. Together with France, Spain, Luxembourg and Germany, Switzerland holds the top
position.
<LI>Heavy consumers (about 10% of the population) account for half of total alcohol consumption.
<LI>In 1987,15 to 20% of adults reported having had an alcohol related problem <I>(Fahrenkrug/Malla
1989</I>).
<LI>Amongst adolescents (16 to 19 years) 58% of boys and 46% of girls drink alcohol at least once a week
<I>(Maller/Beroud 1987).</I>
<LI>Various representative studies conducted between 1975 and 1987 indicate a clear tendency towards a
reduction in the frequency of alcohol consumption and the quantities consumed by the Swiss. More  people,
however, consume moderately (women, young people).
</UL>
<hr>
<H2>Illicit drugs
</H2>
Drug consumption by intravenous injection (heroin and cocaine) is a major public health problem. There
seems to have been a steady increase in intravenous drug consumption between the early 1970s and the late 1980s. Since then the number of drug consumers has remained relatively stable.
A policy promoting medical and social assistance has been developing alongside the traditional policy based
on penal repression.<P>

<H1>Environment</H1>
<HR>
</center>
Swiss legislation contains strict regulations on the protection of the population and the environment (animals,
plants, water, nature, etc.). Awareness and involvement of the population regarding environmental issues are
strong and a considerable number of non-governmental organizations are active in this area.

<H2>Water and sanitation</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The water network in urban and rural areas fully meets the requirements for clean drinking water.
<LI>Connections to the sewage network are mandatory (98% of all buildings, the only exceptions being
remote rural settlements).
<LI>Approx. 90% of the Swiss population is connected to a central water purification station.
</UL>




<H2>Air pollution
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>In comparison to many other European countries, air pollution in Switzerland is relatively moderate
<I>(Ackermann-Liebrich 1993).</I>
<LI>Sulphur dioxide concentrations in densely populated areas and along motorways often exceed permitted
limits.
<LI>Ozone concentration is parlicularly high in rural areas and during summer smog episodes. It exceeds
WHO standards.

<H2>Waste disposal and recycling
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Of a total of 3.7 million tonnes of urban waste,2.2 million tonnes are incinerated and 850,000 tonnes
recycled (paper, glass, compost).
<LI>Some 350,000 tonnes of special waste (not disposable by normal means) are produced yearly, 110,000
tonnes of which are shipped abroad. Transportation of special waste is strictly regulated and monitored.
<LI>In the years to come, special waste disposal sites will have to be selected and many new incineration
facilities built. Strong popular opposition to such projects is difficult to overcome.
</UL>
<P>
<H2>The state of the forests
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Forest decline is on the increase. Between 1985 and 1990, the proportion of trees having lost more than
25% of their leaves or needles increased from 12% to 17% and trees with losses over 10% from 43% to
61%.
</UL>
<H2>Farmland soil
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Soil pollution caused by heavy metals exceeding permitted levels is estimated to affect approx. 10% of
the national territory; zones of heavy pollution are located principally in densely populated areas.
<LI>Switzerland so far lacks reliable statistical data on soil quality. Recently, a National Network for soil
observation (NABO) was set up: some one hundred representative sites are to be periodically examined for
pollutants.
</UL>



<H2>Food poisoning
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Approx.12,000 cases of food poisoning induced by pathogenic agents such as micro-organisms are
annually reported to the Federal Office of Public Health; it is however estimated that these reported cases
include only about 10 percent of all cases.
<LI>In Switzerland, there is high level of safety for food additives. The presence of substances such as
colouring and food preservatives which may cause allergies has to be clearly indicated.
</UL>
<H2>HOUSING       </H2>
<UL>
<LI>The average number of persons per room was estimated at 0.60 in 1990. Some 70% of dwellings have
central heating, and 99% kitchen and cooking facilities.
<LI>Compared to the other European countries, Switzerland has one of the lowest rates of owner occupancy
(30%).
<LI>Recent sharp increases in mortgage rates and subsequent rent increases have led to frequent conflicts
between tenants and landlords. Those groups of the population already at a social disadvantage (migrant
workers, single-parent families, elderly people) have suffered most from thisdevelopment.
<LI>The proportion of people who felt distressed by traffic (noise, combustion gases) increased during the
1980s.
</UL>
<H2>Occupational health
 </H2>
<UL>
<LI>In Switzerland, over 350,000 work-related accidents and about 5000 cases of work-related illnesses
are recorded each year. This represents 130-140 cases per 100,000 employed persons.
<LI>Close to half of the injured (46%) are unable to work for more than three days; 10 work-related
accidents per 100,000 employed persons have a fatal outcome.
<LI>Men have three to four times mole accidents than women. The risk of accidents occurring is particularly
high in the industrial and construction sectors and among workers hired through temporary employment
agencies.

<HR>
</center>
<H2>Health care and health services
</H2>
<H3>Structures</H3>
The Swiss health system is organized on a decentralized and federal basis in which the private sector plays a 
very significant role. It is essentially the cantons which determine the level of the 
services of their own public health systems.          <P>
In Switzerland, there is no ministry of health at federal level. 
The Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Federal Social Insurance Office are part of the Federal
Department (Ministry) of the Interior. Depending on the canton in question, one or several Departments are
responsible for health. The Conference of Cantonal Directors for Health Affairs (CDS), which acts as an
intercantonal coordinator, deals, among others, with problems relating to the planning and management of
the health system which are common to all the cantons. <P>
The decentralized, federal structure of the Swiss health system, explains why there is no single body
responsible for health service provision and planning <I>(Sommer 1987).</I> The private sector plays a very
significant role, without however observing purely market economy rules. Some authors have referred to a
"paradox of ungovernability and efficacy" of the Swiss health system in this context <I>(Lehmann et al.
1989).</I><P>




<H3>Resources </H3>
Switzerland is characterized by an extensive network of out- and in-patient care services catering for its
entire population. The high density of doctors and hospital beds, the small size of the country and its high-
quality transport network guarantee excellent accessibility to the services and care units of the health system.
More than 96% of the population can reach a doctor in less than 30 minutes or at a distance of less than 15
kilometers and 62% in less than 19 minutes <I>(Gutzwiller 1988).</I>


<H3>Health Expenditure   </H3>
<a href="bhexp.gif">Breakdown of Health Expenditure, 1990 </A><P>

<I>Swiss Federal Statistical Office 1993 </I>

<UL>
<LI>In 1990 health expenditure in Switzerland amounted to a total of 26 billion francs (OFS February
1993).
<LI>More than one half (51.4%) of this expenditure is generated by health care establishments (hospitals,
homes providing medical  care and institutions for the care of the disabled) and 40.8% by out-patient
services (doctors,pharmacies,etc.). Administrative costs (social insurance and the state) account for 6.1%,
whereas only 1.6% of overall expenditure is earmarked for prevention.
<LI>The participation of the various payers varies considerably, depending on the type of service in
question: the public authorities (municipalities and cantons) subsidize heavily hospitals and medical home
care services. In contrast, there is virtually no public sector contribution for visits to medical surgeries, 70%
of expenditure being covered by insurances and 30% by the patients themselves. More than 90% of dental
care costs are directly defrayed by the patients.
</UL>





<H3><a href="payers.gif">Proportional share of payers according to type of
service, 1990.</A>  </H3>

<I>Frei/Hill 1992: Thc Swiss health system</I><P><I>
</I><UL>
<LI>Over 90% of cases of illness are dealt with in the framework of out-patient medical care:of 100 cases
of illness, only 6% (compared with 8.3% in 1966) resulted in hospitalization in 1989.
<LI>Approx. one million hospitalizations are recorded annually. The average rate of hospitalizations is 13.7
per 100 insured persons; there has been a substantial increase in this rate in the course of the last 25 years
(8.6% in 1966).
<LI>In 1990, overall medicine sales ran at some 3 billion Swiss francs; this represents an average
expenditure of over 400 francs per person. Between the years 1980 and 1990, there was a 39% rise in
medicine sales in real terms (Pharma Information 1992, p. 77).
<LI>The Swiss health system currently employs over 300 000 persons, i.e. 8% - 9% of the entire working
population of the country. This figure does not only include doctors, nursing and para-medical staff, but also
the personnel of certain institutions (e.g. special schools, rehabilitation centers) and administrative and back-
up services (e.g. hospitals, health insurance).
<LI>In 1990, Switzerland had a total of approx. 21 000 physicians, 5000 dentists, 13 000 physiotherapists
and 133,000 persons working in the field of hospital and non-hospital care <I>(Gilliand et al. 1991).</I>
<LI>Among the members of the Swiss Medical Association(FMH),just over 10,000 doctors are established
in private practice, 37% of whom are general practitioners and 63% specialized physicians. The number of
specialists varies considerably from canton to canton and is higher in cantons with a higher degree of
urbanization.
</UL>
<H3>Out-Patient Health Care        </H3>
Out-patient health care services are the backbone of the Swiss health system. <P>
<UL>
<LI>Medical surgeries provide some 75 million consultations per year. This means that each inhabitant
consults a doctor on average eleven times a year as an out-patient <I>(FMH 1992).</I>
<LI>Physicians in private practice carry out 95% of out-patient medical consultations <I>(Hausser et al.1990);</I> the remaining 5% take place in hospitals.
<LI>An unknown number of non-hospital services and care (SPITEX): home nursing care, home and
family help services, household assistants, meals on wheels.
</UL>




<H3>In-patient care        </H3>
The majority of hospitals in Switzerland are institutions under public law which receive substantial subsidies
from the public authorities. Approx.100 private clinics - which receive no or very few public subsidies - provide approx. 10% of the total number of available beds. Highly specialised health services are provided
by the university hospitals of Zürich, Basle, Berne, Lausanne and Geneva.<P>

<UL>
<LI>In 1990, a total of 305 hospitals provided short-term treatment (physical illness) in Switzerland,
alongside 90 psychiatric and 10 geriatric clinics <I>(VESKA 1992).</I>
<LI>The estimated total number of hospital beds is 58,600: 44,000 for acute care, 13,000 in psychiatric care
and 1,600 in geriatric care. 11 hospitals, including the five university establishments, offer more than 500
beds.
<LI>The occupancy rate is 80% for hospitals providing short-term treatment, 83% for psychiatric clinics and
92% for geriatric clinics.
<LI>The average length of stay in hospitals providing short-term treatment is 13.7 days, 132.8 days in
psychiatric clinics and 64.4 in geriatric clinics. The average length of hospitalization in acute care has fallen
from 26 to 13 days over the last three decades.
<LI>In 1990, Swiss hospitals employed a total of some 106,000 persons (full-time equivalents): 89,000 in
short-term establishments, 14,000 in psychiatric clinics and 2,500 in geriatric clinics <I>(VESKA 1992).</I>
</UL>
<P>
Non-hospital health care establishments include homes for the elderly (irrespective of their degree of
medical or nursing care), institutions for the disabled, drug addicts or alcoholics and thermal, spa,
convalescent, dietic, climatic, preventive and psycho-social treatment centres (including post-cure) <i>(Swiss
Federal Statistical Office 1990).</I><P>
<UL>
<LI>The 2 132 so-called "non-hospital" establishments offer approx. 109,700 beds or places, whereas the
medico-social establishments for the elderly and institutions for the disabled provide 71% of the total
number of beds or places available.
<LI>In 1988, more than 72.000 persons (or 55,500 full-time equivalents) were employed by the non-
hospital establishments. The majority of these were care staff(38%), caterers (27%) or those in social
occupations (17%), specialized therapeutic personnel (5%), doctors (1%) and administrative and technical
(11%) functions accounting for a much smaller proportion.
</UL>
<H3>Health care reforms</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The steady growth of the elderly population as well as the continuing rise in unemployment and poverty
will generate an even higher demand for medical services. The Swiss population is unlikely to accept a
reduced provision of services and a lower quality of care. Rationing access to care will remain highly
unpopular.
<LI>The shortage of nurses of Swiss nationality is likely to grow in the long run. In the course of the process
of European integration, the number of foreign nurses working in Switzerland is expectec to decline.
Domestic recruitment efforts will have to be accompanied by wage increases and improved working
conditions to compewte with professions such as teaching and social work.
<LI>The number of phycisians will continue to increase, even if access to medical schools is restricted by
the possible introduction of a numerus clausus.
<LI>A few cantons are attempting to contain hospitalization costs by means of fixed annual budgetary
allocations. While hospital administrators are under pressure to reduce the length of patient stay, cantons and
local communities are starting to set up alternative structures to avoid unnecessary hospitalisation of
chronically ill and social welfare patients.

<H2>Recent policy development
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Although federal authorities lack the formal competence to adopt a national HFA strategy, HFA
principlcs are increasingly being taken into account at cantonal level <I>(Florio 1992).</I>
<LI>National health promotion/prevention policies and stralegies have been established by the Federal
Office for Public Health (AIDS, drugs, alcohol and tobacco) and the Swiss Foundation for Health Promotion
(health at the workplace, adolescent health and cancer prevention).
<LI>Debates over the last decade have focused on thc financial situation of the health insurance companies.
There is widespread agreement that the practice of picking out 'good risks' must be stopped in order to
maintain socialsolidarity. Although the pace of reforms is slow, recent proposals include:
<UL>
<LI>a general obligation for all Swiss residents to subscribe lo health insurance;
<LI>a single basic coverage premium for all adults, irrespective of age or gender,
<LI>a common fund providing financial compensation among insurance companies with different risk
structures (limited to ten years);
<LI>an increase in patient co-payments for ambulatory medical care from 10 to 15%;
<LI>individual subsidies for those in the lower-income brackets.
</UL>
<LI>If implemented, the proposed measures could help to reduce the heavy insurance burden on low and
middle-income households, but are unlikely to curb the growth in heallh care expenses.
<LI>Despite widespread opposition, the Federal Parliament recently decided on several urgent measures:
compulsory risk compensation payments among insurance companies, a maximum premium increase of
10% perannum and a nominal patient participation of about 7 US Dollars per day of hospitalisation.
<LI>Since the early l990s, a few Health Maintenance Organisations (HMO) have been progressively setup
in Zurich, Basle and Geneva on a experimental basis. They have some 10,000 members nationwide.
</UL>
<H2>Research</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The Swiss Confederation supports medical research via the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)
and direct contributions in areas such as illicit drugs, AIDS, cancer and rheumatism.
<LI>Four National Research Programs (NRP) are currently underway:
<UL>
<LI>NRP 26: "Population, environment and health" (influence of the physical environment on health,
chronic diseases, psychosocial aspects of AIDS).
<LI>NRP 29: "Changing life styles and social security" (consequences of poverty and social insecurity on
the utilization of health care and social services).
<LI>NRP 32: "Ageing" (social integration and health of elderly people).
<LI>NRP 34: "Complementary medicine" (diagnostic and therapeutic methods, efficacy and economic
aspects).
</UL>
<LI>Various Swiss Federal Offices promote and fund research in the following fields:
<UL>
<LI>cancer, AIDS and drug addiction <I>(Federal Office of Public Health).</I>
<LI>national reporting on health and health system analysis. Under the shared responsibility of the Swiss
Federal Statistical
<LI>Office and the Swiss Institute for Public Health, health surveys were conducted in five cantons in 1989
and the first Swiss National Health Report was issued in 1991 <I>(Weiss 1993).</I>
<LI>A first nationwide comprehensive Health Survey commissioned by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office
will be completed in 1993.

Switzerland actively participates in the elaboration and implementation of the "Health for all by the year
2000" targets for the European Region (Swiss Federal Statistical Office and Swiss Institute for Public Health
1992). It works in close cooperation with the Council of Europe in projects concerning prevention, health
education, health manpower planning and guidelines and recommendations in the fields of blood transfusion
and organ transplantations formulated by the European Health Committee and its subsidiary bodies. In this
area, it also works within the Pompidou group, which fosters European cooperation in the fight against drug
abuse and illegal drug trafficking. Switzerland further cooperates closely with the specialized agencies of the
UN. Finally, Switzerland participates  in a number of bodies of the WHO/FAO Code Alimentarius.  <P>
<UL>
<LI>Switzerland is involved in various special WHO programmes (Global Programme on AIDS, Special
Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, Special Programme of Research, Development
and Research Training in Human Reproduction, Action Programme on Essential Drugs, Diarrhoeal Diseases
Control Programme, Safe Motherhood Programme, training courses in immunology).
<LI>Switzerland collaborates with the WHO Regional Office for Europe in the following fields:
<UL>
<LI>the European Charter on "Environment and Health": Switzerland makes a special financial contribution
to the implementation of the European Charter, adopted by the Ministerial Conference on "Environment and
Health" in December 1989. The contribution benefits the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as a
priority;
<LI>nuclear accidents and public health - The consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident The WHO
programme "Nuclear Accidents and Public Health", concluded in the autumn of 1991, permitted the
elaboration of a new concept for health measures in the event of serious nuclear accidents and the
establishment of a notification system for a rapid exchange of information between national authorities and
international organizations in cases of nuclear emergency. This collaboration is currently being  pursued in
the form of support for scientific meetings and in the field of research with a view to reducing the impact of
Chernobyl;
<LI>the process of reform in Central and Eastern Europe: Switzerland supports the efforts of the WHO
Regional Office for Europe in the field of public health (funds to support visits of experts appointed by
WHO to Countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the introduction of the joint WHO EURO-, Council of
Europe and EC - Programme on Health Promoting Schools and AIDS prevention programmes).
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The responsibility for the cooperation with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the newly
independent states is divided between the Political Directorate, Cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe
(technical cooperation) and the Federal Office of Foreign Trade (financial aid). Only projects proposed by
the recipient countries themselves are selected for support. Funds are made available for a number of areas,
including health. Priority areas in the health sector are reorganisation and improvement of health care
services, in particular ambulatory care and prevention (aids, drug abuse).
<LI>In Switzerland, responsibility for cooperation with developing countries, including the health field, lies
with the Directotate for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DDA), attached to the Federal
Department (the Ministry) of Foreign Affairs. The efforts of the DDA are aimed at helping the countries in
question to help themselves. In the health field, this policy may take two different directions:
<UL>
<LI>grant of financial and technical assistance for the elaboration of a "Health for All" strategy in the
country in question and the promotion of training and implementing measures for the application of this
strategy,
<LI>consideration of social and health aspects in cases of structural adjustment
</UL>
<LI>Approx.20 Swiss institutes and bodies have the status of "active WHO collaborating centres", mainly in
the field of medical or clinical biology.
