<p>

Suppose you go outside and throw an apple straight up into the air. The Earth's
<A HREF="#gravity"><i>gravity</i></A> slows the upward speed of the apple until it finally stops--and then
starts falling back down.
<p>
But suppose you could throw the apple so fast that Earth's gravity could never
quite make it stop and fall back down. That speed is called <A HREF="#escape"><i>escape velocity</i></A>-- for
Earth, the escape velocity is 25,000 miles per hour. On planets or stars with
more gravity, the escape velocity would be even higher. Some planets and stars
have the same mass but different sizes. In that case, the smallest one will have
the greatest gravity at its surface.
<p>
Stars can change size (and gravity) very dramatically. A star's gravity works not
only on objects outside the star but also among the particles that make up the
star. These particles attract one another and the star would collapse if it
weren't for the nuclear energy pushing outward. When the nuclear fuel runs out,
there is no more energy to keep the star from collapsing into a very small and
dense sphere.
<p>
The ultimate size of this sphere depends on the original mass of the star. Oddly,
the largest stars result in the smallest spheres. If a star has a mass less then
1.4 times the sun's, gravity among its particles will not be able to overcome the
tendency of the electrons, protons, and neutrons to remain separate. The forces
will balance when the star has become a white dwarf the size of a small planet.
If a star has between 1.4 and 3.6 solar masses, the gravitational force is so
great that electrons combine with protons to form neutrons. The resulting neutron
star will be only a few miles in radius.
<p>
For stars with more than 3.6 solar masses, even the forces that hold elementary
particles apart cannot overcome gravity and the entire star shrinks until its
radius is essentially zero. In the region very near this pinpoint of matter,
gravity becomes almost infinite. Even four or five miles from this <A HREF="#singularity"><i>singularity</i></A>,
gravity is so great that the escape velocity equals the speed of light.
Einstein's general <A HREF="#theory"><i>theory of relativity</i></a> showed that light, though it does not
react to gravity in the same way as ordinary matter, is nevertheless affected by
strong gravitational fields. In fact, light itself cannot escape from inside this
region. The imaginary surface at this radius is known as the "event horizon."
<p>
From outside, the event horizon would appear perfectly dark (since no light can
escape) and hence would appear to be a <A HREF="#black"><i>black hole</i></A> in space. How do astronomers
observe black holes?
<p>
When charged particles accelerate, they emit electromagnetic radiation (like
visible light or X rays).   Astronomers look for regions in the sky with
radiation consistent with charged particles accelerating toward a black hole.
Researchers attempt to rule out other possible causes of this radiation to prove
that black holes really do exist.

<h1><b>FIND A BLACK HOLE</b></h1> 
<b>Pretend you are an astronomer and shoot a light beam into space
to locate a black hole.</b>
<p>


<h2><b><A NAME="main">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2></b>
<p>
Much of science involves making inferences about things that you cannot see. If
there is nothing falling into a black hole, there is no way to see the black
hole. Could we still find it? In this activity you will simulate trying to find a
black hole by shooting "light beams" through a region of space and inferring the
position of the black hole from the deflections of the beams.
<p>
<b>Materials</b> 
<ul>
<li> graph paper 
<li> protractor 
<li> ruler 
<li> pencil
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Find a partner. One player operates the "black hole"; the other is an
astronomer.
<p>
<li> Each player draws a large square 20 cm (about 8") on a side. The black hole
player secretly marks the hole's position in her/his square.
<p>
<li> Using a ruler, the astronomer draws a light beam through her/his square.
<p>
<li> The black hole player uses the protractor to deflect each beam. Here's how: 
<ul>
<li> Copy the beam from the astronomer's paper to your own. 
<li> Measure how close the beam comes to the black hole. 
<li> From the point of closest approach, bend the beam according to the following table:
<p>
<br>0-1 cm 	The beam is absorbed by the black hole. It doesn't come out. 
<br>1-2 cm	Deflect 60* 
<br>2-3 cm	Deflect 30* 
<br>3-4 cm	Deflect 15* 
<br>4-5 cm	Deflect 5* 
<br>>5 cm	No deflection 
<p>
<li> On the astronomer's paper, mark where the beam comes out (not how close the beam came).
Repeat steps 3 and 4.
</ul>
<p>
<li> When the astronomer knows where the black hole is, that player marks the place
(or the region) where it must be and gives it to the black hole player to check.
Take turns hiding the black hole.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Extensions</b> 
<ol>
<li> Use coordinates to give your hypothesis and receive your result:
"My beam goes in at (0, 7) and is heading for (18, 20)." "Well, it actually comes
out at (11, 20)." 
<li> A teacher can draw the "astronomer's map" on the blackboard
for all to see.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b> 
<ol>
<li> What do you know after one move of this game? 
<li> What strategies can you use to find the black hole? 
<li> This activity is really "science fiction"
since this method couldn't really be used to find black holes. An authentic
search would require an array of astronomers to cover a large part of the galaxy
(or many galaxies) on the other side of the black hole from the origin of the
light beam. Second, given the finite speed of light, even if such an array could
be put in place, the experiment would require hundreds, if not thousands of years
to complete. Given this information, if we were really doing this in space, what
would be needed? What light beams could be used?

<b><A NAME="try"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></A></b><p> Stretch a piece of cloth over a round garbage can. Use rubber bands
to hold the cloth in place, like a drum head. Have a partner depress the center
of the cloth with the eraser end of a pencil to make a gravitational "well."
Shoot marbles or Ping-Pong balls around the well. If they don't fly off, they'll
"orbit" as they fall in. How many times can you get them to go around before they
hit the pencil? (Wear goggles to do this activity.)
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Invite an astronomy teacher or student from a local college or

<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> In a group, develop a skit about a black hole. Try to make it
interesting and also scientifically accurate. For example, if you fell in, you

of your skit or perform it live.

<h1>Blood Typing</h1>
What makes different blood types different?<br>
<hr>
</center>
David gives a pint of blood and finds out about blood typing.<BR>
Segment length:  7:45
<P>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
By simply looking at a sample of human blood, it wouldn't seem like anything more 
than a red liquid.  The truth is that blood is a complex fluid made up of many 
different components, each with a specific job.  The first analysis of blood was 
carried out by Marcello Malpighi in 1661, who discovered that much of blood is 
composed of large red cells that have no nucleus.  These cells are called erythrocytes,
and we now know that they are responsible for gas exchange within the tissues of our 
body.
<p>
Almost 200 years later, Joseph Davaire discovered that blood also has large white 
cells that move about like amoebas.  Outnumbered by red cells by a ratio of 650:1, 
these white cells-leukocytes-help protect our bodies from foreign agents, such as 
bacteria and viruses.  In addition to red and white cells, most human blood contains 
<a href="#five">platelets</a> and <a href="#six">proteins</a> that help clot the blood.  All three of these components can be
separated from the blood after donation and used for different purposes.
<p>
The first successful human blood <a href="#seven">transfusion</a> was accomplished in 1818 by James 
Blundell.  In 1900, Karl Lanstreimer observed that the blood of one individual, when 
mixed with the blood of another, might cause hemolysis, the visible clumping of red 
cells.  This observation resulted in the establishment of blood typing:  the 
distinction of four blood groups-A, B, AB, and O.
<p>
These different blood types are caused by the presence of a chemical marker-an 
<a href="#two">antigen</a>-on the surface of the type-A and type-B red blood cells.  When mixed with the 
wrong blood type, these antigens are picked up by <a href="#three">antibodies</a> that cause the cells to 
clump.  Someone with type-AB blood can receive any type blood with no ill effects, 
while people with type-O blood can only take their own type. People with type-A blood 
can receive A or O, and people with type-B blood can take B or O.  This makes type-O 
blood the universal donor.  Blood donors and recipients must be typed and matched 
very carefully before transfusions are given.
<P>
<h4>Connections</h4>

1.  Why is it important for hospitals to have a ready supply of many different blood 
types?  What kinds of tests are done on blood donations before they are used in 
transfusions?<BR>
2.  Why is it important to know your own blood type?<BR>
3.  For how long can different blood components be stored?  What use does each of the 
components have?

 Main Activity</h4></a>
<p>
<center>
<h1>What's Your Type?</h1>
Find out how your blood type fits in with that of the general population.
</center>
<P>
By classifying blood types, you can find out what type of blood is most common among 
your students, and whether this information is similar to national statistics.<P>
<b>Materials</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>removable sticky notes<BR>
<li>graph paper<BR>
<li>pencils
</ul>
<P>
<ol>
<li>Have each student find out his or her blood type by asking at home, consulting 
a birth certificate, or reviewing a recent blood test.<p>
<li>Pass around the note paper and have each person record his or her blood type on a 
separate sheet.  Collect the notes and post them on a wall, sorting them by groups to 
form a simple bar graph.  <p>
<li>Record the number of individuals in each group.<p>
<li>Based on the class population and the information in the segment, calculate how 
many potential donors are present for each blood group.  (For example, those with 
type-A blood can receive blood from either type-As or type-Os.)
</ol>
<P>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  Are the blood types evenly distributed throughout the group or does one type 
dominate?  Expand the population to include other classes or the whole school and see 
if the distribution changes.  From your data, can you predict the general blood group 
distribution for your region?<p>
2.  Which blood type has the most potential donors in your group?  Which blood type 
is most limited when it comes to donors?<p>
3.  Does the blood-group distribution for your class/area match the national 
distribution?  What factors might influence the local patterns of blood types?

You can get an idea of how blood is separated into its various components by using 
centrifugal force to separate chocolate milk.  Try to relate the different components 
of chocolate milk to the different components of blood.  Use powdered chocolate-milk 
mix to make about a cup of chocolate milk.  Punch or drill two holes on either side 
of a clean, plastic, one-liter soda bottle about two inches down from the top and 
pass a wire or rope through the holes; securely tie the ends of the wire or rope 
together.  Pour about half of the freshly-made chocolate milk into the bottle.  
Tighten the cap on the bottle and swing the bottle around (in an area clear of 
people!) by the rope or wire for 30 seconds.  After spinning, compare the chocolate 
milk in the bottle to the reserved mixture.

Inside your bones is a thick mass of cells called bone marrow. Every
hour, a small number of <A HREF="#eight">stem cells</A> in it create all other kinds of blood cells
that exist in your body, including <A HREF="#five">leukocytes, <A HREF="#three">erythrocytes</A>, and <A HREF="#six">platelets</A>. These
cells are essential to your health - leukocytes fight infection, erythrocytes carry
oxygen, and platelets help the blood clot.<p>When a person has a blood disease,
such as <A HREF="#one">aplastic anemia</A> or <A HREF="#four">leukemia</A>, doctors may perform bone marrow transplants
to re-establish a healthy blood supply. Many transplants occur after a patient
has received <A HREF="#two">chemotherapy</A> or <A HREF="#seven">radiation treatment</A> to destroy cancerous or other
disease-causing cells. Both abnormal and normal cells are killed by these
treatments, including stem cells. A bone marrow transplant starts the blood
production process from scratch with normal stem cells.<p>
An allogeneic
transplant - where another person's bone marrow is given to a patient - doesn't
always work because of rejection or because of graft-versus-host disease.
Rejection of the donor's marrow occurs because our bodies fight off invading
foreign cells. If a donor's marrow doesn't match perfectly, the recipient's
immune system may identify the new cells as foreign and destroy them, leaving the
patient unable to create new blood. <p>Graft-versus-host disease occurs because
the new immune system from the donor's marrow may identify the patient's body as
foreign and try to destroy it. When the donor's immune cells in the marrow attack
the patient, many symptoms may result and, in severe cases, the patient could
die.<p>Doctors decrease these risks by trying to select a patient/donor pair
whose immune cells will identify each other as &quot;self.&quot; An identical
twin's cells will see the other twin's cells as self. But most patients do not
have an identical twin. So doctors look at a person's human leukocyte antigens
(HLA) to match donor and patient bone marrow. These are proteins present on the
surface of our cells. They play a big role in telling immune cells that other
cells are either foreign or &quot;friendly&quot; self cells.<p>Doctors will look
at HLA antigens on your siblings' cells, because you have a 25 percent chance of
having an HLA match with a brother or sister. Among unrelated people, only one in
20,000 people will be an acceptable match.<p>

<font size=+5>What Are the Odds?</font>
<br>
Find the connection
between rolling dice and a genetic match.<br>
</center>
 
<BR> <p>
What are the chances of getting a
match at random from an unrelated donor? In this activity, you will learn about
probability using a pair of dice.<p>

<b>Materials</b><BR> 
<ul><li>pair of dice<BR>  
<li>paper<BR> 
<li>pencil<BR> 
<li>calculator<p>

</ul>
1.  If you rolled a pair of dice, what
chance would you have of getting matching numbers? Write down how many times you
think you'd have to try before you got a match.<BR> 
2.  The first concept you
need to know is that the probability of something happening is expressed in this
simple equation:<p>probability = <br>
number of favorable outcomes <BR>
 - divided - by -<br>
number of possible outcomes<BR>
 In this example, you're trying to get an outcome where the
two dice match. A die is a cube with six possibilities: you can roll either a 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So with one die, your probability of rolling a 5 is:
<p>
1 (number of favorable outcomes)<BR>
-<br>
6 (number of possible outcomes)<p>
3.  Next, you have to figure out how your probability
changes when you roll a pair of dice. First, consider what the new number of
possible outcomes is. Before, there were six. Now, there are many more
combinations possible. Below is a chart listing all the possible rolls for your
dice, naming them Die A and Die B. We started the chart to help you figure it
out. Fill in the missing numbers to complete all the possible die
rolls.<BR>
<pre>
Die A Die B   Die A Die B   Die A Die B   Die A Die B   Die A Die B   Die A Die B
  1  &  1       1  &  2       1  &  3       1  &  4       1  &  5       1  &  6
  2  &  1       2  &  2       2  &  3       2  &  4       2  &  5       2  & ( )
  3  &  1       3  &  2       3  & ( )      3  & ( )      3  & ( )     ( ) & ( )
  4  &  1      ( ) &  2       4  & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )
  5  &  1       5  & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )
  6  &  1      ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )     ( ) & ( )

</pre>
4.  Count how many possible outcomes you can have when
rolling two dice. If we wanted to calculate our chances of rolling a 5 on either
or both dice, we would have to rewrite our probability equation:<p>

probability = <br>
??? (Number of times Die A=5, Die B=5, or both=5 -- fill in your count from above)<BR>
---<br>
??? (Number of all possible rolls -- fill in your count from above)<p>
<img align=right hspace=5 src="illustrations/bonmrw.gif">
5.  Now
use what you've learned and the chart you've completed to calculate the chances
of rolling matching die.<p>

<b>Questions</b><BR> 
1.  The HLA proteins are determined by
genes on chromosome 6. Each parent has two of these chromosomes, and these four
HLA types are almost always different. You inherited one HLA type from each
parent, as did your siblings. What is the probability that one of your siblings
inherited the same HLA types that you did?<p>

<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif"></a>
<br clear=left><BR> There are four
different blood types: O, A, B, and AB. Try to find out the blood type for
everyone in your family, including yourself. To whom could you donate blood? Who
could donate blood to you?<p>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left><BR> Create a simple model showing how your
blood cells are suspended in plasma, making blood. Fill a glass jar with corn
syrup to represent plasma and add tea leaves, bits of confetti, and pepper to act
as blood cells. Put the lid on tightly and shake the jar to get an idea of how
blood cells travel in plasma through your system. What happens when you let the
&quot;blood&quot; sit for a while? Does the heart's pumping action do more than
just transport blood?<p>

<h1>Broken Bones</h1>
What can cause a bone to break?<br>
<hr>
</center>
David gets wrapped up in a cast to learn about broken bones.<br>
Segment length:  7:30
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
The human skeletal system is designed to support the human body, offer it
protection, and provide a means of locomotion.  Bone is the essential framework
to which muscles are attached.
<p>
Bone is constructed in layers.  The outside layer is known as the periosteum.
This is where blood vessels and nerve cells are located.  The next layer is the
compact bone.  This area has <a href="#two">collagen</a> and crystals of calcium and phosphorus.
The next layer is of spongy bone, with shock-absorber qualities.  Then the
medullary cavity, filled with <a href="#four">marrow</a>, forms the inside of the bone.  This
layered-tube architecture allows the bone its <a href="#three">compressional strength</a>, while
keeping it very light.
<p>
However, forces on bones are not always compressional.  Lateral forces,
twisting stresses, and powerful impacts may cause the bone to break, or
fracture.  There are two types of fractures:  closed and open.  A closed
fracture occurs when the skin is not broken.  An open fracture is when the skin
has been broken and involves an open wound.  This type of fracture is more
serious because of the increased risk of infection and shock caused by blood
loss and damaged tissue.
<p>
Keeping the broken body part stationary -- immobilizing it -- will stabilize the
injured area and prevent the bones from shifting until further treatment is
available.  Splints are used to immobilize an area.  They can be made from
cardboard, newspapers, sticks, or any other rigid material.
<p>
When a <a href="#one">cast</a> is needed, the doctor first checks that the bones are in correct
alignment to promote proper healing.  A cast is then placed over the fractured
area to immobilize it, allowing the bones to grow back and heal in the desired
configuration.
<p>
Although fractures are an unfortunate occurrence, most of us can take
precautions to avoid them.  There are certain diseases, however, that make some
people more susceptible to fractures.  Diseases of the bone, including
<a href="#six">osteoporosis</a>, <a href="#seven">rickets</a>, and <a href="#five">osteoarthritis</a> can cause bone deterioration or
fragility.  This can increase the likelihood or severity of a bone fracture.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>
1.  What are the effects of nutrition on bones?<br>
2.  Invite an orthopedic surgeon to your classroom to discuss some of these
topics:  high-technology materials used in joint replacements; the effects of
aging on bones; and the healing process of bones.  <br>
3.  Have you ever broken a bone?  What did it feel like?  What was it like to
wear a cast?

</ol>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  List other types of materials that can be used for splinting.<p>
2.  Discuss possible ways people may break a bone.<p>
3.  Which is easier to splint, the arm or the leg?
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Go to a butcher shop and ask for some bones with the joints attached.  Use
these as a visual aid to learn about the construction of the bone, joints,
tendons, and ligaments.  Draw pictures or write summaries about the structure
of bones.  (Bones can spoil, so make sure you refrigerate them!)
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Obtain two different X-rays of a broken bone:  one of the bone before the cast
was applied and one of the healed bone.  Study each X-ray.  Is the break
visible in the X-ray?  Does the bone change in size or appearance after it has
healed?  (It may appear thicker in the area of the break.)  Arrange for a trip
to the X-ray department of an area hospital, or invite an orthopedic surgeon to
visit your classroom to help in this study of X-rays.
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Not all broken bones are treated in the same way.  New medical techniques have
improved the outcomes for those with broken bones, including better healing and
increased mobility.  Research the different methods for treating injured bones,
such as the uses of different types of casts, the application of electronic
equipment to relieve pain, or the use of artificial materials to create
replacement bones and joints.
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Have a chicken dinner and save the bones.  Wash them and clean off any
remaining meat.  Let them dry thoroughly.  Place half of the bones in a jar of
vinegar and store the other half in a dry area until needed.  The bones in
vinegar should sit for three to four days.  At the end of this time, drain the
vinegar.  The bones that were submerged in the vinegar should be flexible
compared to the bones that have been left to dry.  Compare the two different
sets of bones, making sure you have an ample supply of each type.  What is the
difference between the two sets of bones?  Find out what causes a bone to be
hard.  Why isn't one bone hard?  What important mineral does the vinegar
deplete?  What other parts of your body are made of this type of material?

<i>Why is the sky blue?</i></center><p><hr>

David finds out how the atmosphere makes different colors.<p>
<ul>
<li>Where does color come from?  
<li>Why isn't the sky blue at night?  
<li>Is the sky always the same shade of blue?  
<li>What does the sky look like on the Moon?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Why is the sky blue?  People have been asking this question for centuries.  The
generally accepted scientific 
explanation for blue sky was first proposed by Lord Rayleigh, a British physicist
and mathematician of the late 1800's.
<p>
Rayleigh's theory was unique.  He agreed with other scientists of the time that
dust and other large particles in the 
atmosphere could scatter light, and that when this occurred, the <A
href="#spect">spectral </a>colors red and <A href="#blue">blue</a> were revealed.
 Rayleigh 
also agreed that no light was absorbed by large particles, but he took this
concept of scattering in the atmosphere 
one step further.  
<p>
Rayleigh concluded that as light traveled from the Sun to an observer, it
encountered molecules, mostly of nitrogen and
oxygen, in the atmosphere.  Rayleigh then calculated a mathematical formula that
demonstrated that, even in an 
atmosphere without smoke and dust, gas molecules like oxygen could redirect
sunlight and scatter it in many directions.
Sunlight is a form of visible light that contains all of the colors.  When it is
scattered, it is perceived by the 
human eye as having a specific color.  When sunlight encounters gas molecules in
the atmosphere, high <A href="#freq">frequency</a> blue 
light is scattered out first.  The most intense blues are usually seen between
10:00 a.m. and 
3:00 p.m. on cloudless days, if we look at the sky about 45 degrees above the
horizon with our with our backs to the 
Sun.<p>  As the Sun begins to set, the sky at the horizon often appears to be
red.  Sunlight entering at the horizon level
travels through more atmosphere than sunlight entering overhead.  Most of the
shorter wavelength light has been 
scattered out, allowing longer <A href="#wavel">wavelengths </a>of light to reach
our eyes.  When particles of dust provide additional 
opportunities for scattering, sunsets have a red glow.  The brilliance is often
enhanced in the sky by clouds.<p>

<B>Weather or Not?</B><p>
How does a change in weather affect the color of the sky? <p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
By keeping daily records of weather conditions, you will be able to study how
particles in the atmosphere scatter light
and change the color of the sky.
<p>


Materials:<ul>
<li>Log book
<li>Weather news or reports</ul>
<p>
1.  Begin a two to four week log to record your daily observations of the sky
where you live.<p>
2.  Choose two times per day that you will record your observations in the log. 
Always look at the sky with the sun 
behind you, and choose two areas of the sky to monitor.  Your observation points
should be at a 45 degree angle above 
the horizon.  Never look directly into the sun!<p>
3.  Decide what words you will use to describe the different hues you may see. 
Pick a number to correspond to the 
intensity of the various hues.  Include descriptions of the clouds and their
brightness.<p>
4.  Write a brief description of what you see at both observation points each
time you observe the sky.  Include your 
notes about the weather at the bottom of each day's entry.<p>
<p>
<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  How did the sun's angle in relation to the horizon affect what you saw at
each viewing point?  How was it different
on sunny and rainy days?<p>
2.  What did you notice about the brightness of the thick and thin clouds?<p>
3.  When and where did you see the most intense colors?  How might the cloud
cover have contributed to what you 
observed?<p>
4.  Did the hue and and the intensity compare to what you expected at the time
you begin the activity?<br>
<b>NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN WHEN YOU ARE EXPLORING THE SECRETS OF
LIGHT!</b><p>

Over the course of a month, look for examples of sunlight that has been
scattered.  Note the conditions that might 
have caused the sunlight to be redirected.  Examples might include dew on a
spider's web, oil on the ground after a 
rainstorm or light through a chandelier or glass ornament.<p>

Find two pairs of polarizing sunglasses or pieces of polarizing filters.  Between
10 a.m. and 3 p.m., look at the sky, 
away from the sun, through the glasses or filter.  Place the second pair of
glasses or piece of filter in front of the 
first.  Rotate the polarizers and look through them again.  How has the image
been altered?<p>

Build your own spectroscope to study the colors of the spectrum.  You will need a
covered shoebox or oatmeal box and a 
piece of diffraction grating (available through Edmund Scientific Company listed
in the Resource section) that 
measures five centimeters by five centimeters.  Cut a two and a half by two and a
half centimeter square in one end of

<p>

We often see the negative side of explosives on the news--images of twisted metal
on damaged buildings or debris and rubble in a war zone. But explosives also help
us construct tunnels, mine underground, remove obstacles during road
construction, extinguish oil well fires, inflate automobile air bags, and destroy
hazardous wastes.
<p>
An explosive is a stable material that, upon stimulation, very rapidly changes
from a solid or liquid into a hot, expanding gas. The sudden release of energy
and the accompanying pressure exerted on the surrounding materials by the
expanding gas constitute an <A HREF="#explosion">explosion</A>. If you confined an explosive, you would
increase the likelihood of the <A HREF="#detonation">detonation</A> by increasing the speed of the
reaction. For example, when gunpowder is confined within the paper wrapping of a
firecracker, it explodes when ignited. However, the same powder sprinkled in the
open simply burns when ignited. In the confined state, the heat generated at the
point of ignition will immediately ignite a large amount of surrounding material.
The expanding gases from all the "burning" gun powder will act together,
resulting in an explosion.
<p>
Explosives fall into two categories: detonating and <A HREF="#propellant">propellant</A>. Detonating
explosives are further classified as initiating (primary) or secondary.
<A HREF="#initexplosives">Initiating explosives</A>, the more sensitive of the two, must be handled with
extreme care. They require only a low energy stimulus, such as being touched with
a hot wire or tapped with a hammer, to explode. For that reason, they are put
into <A HREF="#blastcap">blasting caps</A>.
<p>
Secondary explosives are less sensitive and can burn without producing an
explosion. They only detonate by means of a severe shock, delivered by another
explosive (usually a blasting cap) placed in or near them. Since they are
relatively stable, large amounts can be moved and handled safely.
<p>
The velocity at which explosives detonate determines their function. Explosives
of low detonating velocity supply a slow push or heave. Explosives with a high
detonating velocity have a bursting or shattering effect.
<p>
Propellant explosives are used for firearms, rockets, general engineering, and
demolition work. They differ from detonating explosions in that an avenue of
escape is provided for the expanding gases. For example, when the explosive
propellant in the space shuttle solid rocket boosters is ignited, all the gases
from the resulting continuous explosion escape out the bottom, providing upward
thrust. Unlike a detonating explosive, not all the explosive material is burned
at once in a propellant explosive.
<p>
Industries rely on small explosive charges for a number of purposes. In
metallurgy, for example, metals can be pressed into dies, extruded, or welded
together by means of such explosions. New metal alloys have been created that
way.

<p>
Imagine what your own brain looks like inside your head. It is
pinkish gray on the outside, yellowish white on the inside, and
covered with ripples or convolutions. The brain has a delicate
consistency, like soft ice cream, and requires the shell-like
skull to protect it from injury.
<p>
Although it may not seem like it, you have just performed an
amazing feat. You have used your brain to think about itself.
As far as we know, human beings are the only animals on Earth
who can contemplate their own brains.
<p>
If you take a close look at a human brain, you'll find it has
three main parts. By far, the largest is the <A
NAME="cerebrum"><I>cerebrum</I></A>
on top. The intricate surface of the cerebrum is called the <A NAME=cerebral
cortex"><I>cerebral cortex</I></A>. Although only 0.3 centimeters (1/8") thick,
the cerebral cortex is critical to your ability to move as you please, to
understand what you see and hear, and to do the complex process
called thinking--making decisions, learning, analyzing,
remembering, planning, and contemplating.
<p>
Your cerebrum is divided into two halves. Each has specialized 
functions. An "electric highway" of nerve fibers, the corpus 
callosum, connects the two, allowing information to pass between. 
<p>
At the back of your brain and beneath the cerebral cortex is 
the <A NAME="cerebellum"><I>cerebellum</I></A>. It coordinates 
skilled movement, giving you the ability to juggle, dance, 
type, walk without stumbling, and drink without slobbering. 
Located at the base of the brain is the brain stem, a stalklike 
structure that connects it to the spinal cord. The brain stem 
takes care of basic, involuntary functions, such as breathing, 
blinking, and keeping your intestines churning.
<p>
Every part of the human brain is made of billions of nerve cells 
called neurons. Each neuron has connections to thousands of other 
neurons. For you to read this (or even to daydream), millions of 
your neurons must communicate with one another.
<p>
A neuron accepts signals from other neurons through branchlike 
structures called <A NAME="dendrites"><I>dendrites</I></A>. 
Whenever enough messages arrive from neighboring neurons to 
excite it, a neuron sends an electrical impulse down its trunklike 
<A NAME="axon"><I>axon</I></A>. When the impulse arrives at the 
end of the axon, it causes little sacs to release chemical 
messengers. These chemicals, called <A
NAME="neurotransmitters"><I>neurotransmitters</I></A>
, then travel across tiny gaps called <A NAME="synapses"><I>synapses</I></A>
to arrive at and excite other neurons. 
<p>
When you learn something new, your neurons actually grow more 
dendrites to reach other neurons. The more you practice, the 
stronger these connections become. With 100 trillion possible 
connections, your brain is one of the most complex regions in the 
universe.<br>

Santiago Ramon y Cajal, a Spanish artist and neuroscientist, was 
the first person to figure out what a neuron looks like. Using a 
cell-staining substance called silver salts, he was able to 
observe and draw the intricate patterns of neurons in the brain 
and spinal cord. Through his research, he concluded that synapses 
provide the means for communication between nerve cells. In 1906 
he won the Nobel Prize for his work. Use artistic and research 
skills to create your own model of a neuron.<p>

try another. Work with your model until you feel it represents the
basic structure and ideas you want it to represent. 
<LI> Extending the model: If you haven't already, try extending 
your model to include neurotransmitters, both those that excite 
and those that inhibit another neuron from firing. Have several

<p>

Bread baking transforms an ordinary kitchen into a laboratory of earthy sights, 
smells, and tastes. A recipe, after all, reads like a scientific experiment. The 
baker combines flour, yeast, liquid, and salt in a bowl, shapes it all into a dough, 
lets the dough rise, and bakes it in a hot oven.<p>

Flour, which gives bread its structure, is made by milling cereal grains such as 
wheat, barley, or rye. In this process, the grain seeds are crushed, releasing starch 
and proteins.<p> 

Starch molecules are long, gangly <A NAME="polymer"><I>polymers</I></A> of simple sugars linked head to tail by 
<A NAME="chemical"><I>chemical bonds</I></A>. Proteins are more complex--a single protein may contain hundreds of 
<A NAME="amino"><I>amino acids</I></A> strung together like beads on a necklace. <p>

What gives bread its light, fluffy texture? The answer is gliadin and glutenin, two 
proteins found in flour. When flour is added to water and kneaded, these proteins 
swell up like sponges and form a tough elastic substance called gluten. Gluten can 
stretch and trap the bubbles of gas that make dough rise.<p>

That gas comes from the <A NAME="leavening"><I>leavening</I></A> action of tiny one-celled fungi called yeast. When 
you combine yeast with flour and water, you'll end up with a sticky white dough. 
Inside the dough, <A NAME="fermentation"><I>fermentation</I></A> is occurring and molecules are on the move. Enzymes 
from the yeast cells attack starch, breaking it down into glucose. Other <A NAME="enzyme"><I>enzymes</I></A> 
transform glucose molecules into carbon dioxide and ethanol. The carbon dioxide (CO2) 
gas then bubbles up through the mixture, causing the dough to rise.<p>

Breads which are leavened by baking powder instead of yeast lack the tasty molecules 
of fermented bread. That's because when baking powder gets wet, a <A NAME="chemicalr"><I>chemical reaction</I></A> 
occurs that releases only carbon dioxide, salt, and water. <p>

In breads leavened with yeast, however, the yeast cells grow under <A NAME="anaerobic"><I>anaerobic</I></A> 
conditions and cannot convert glucose molecules completely to gas. Some sugar 
molecules get sidetracked and are converted into alcohols, acids, and 
esters--substances which add to bread's flavor. <p>

Salt strengthens gluten by slowing down the enzymes which <A NAME="catalyze"><I>catalyze</I></A> the breakdown of 
proteins. If you add too little salt, the dough is tough and sticky. If you add too 
much, water flows out of yeast cells by osmosis. Then nutrients are lost and 
production of carbon dioxide slows down. <p>

After dough rises a couple of hours in a warm place, it's ready to go into the oven. 
There, heat causes pockets of gas in the dough to expand. Eventually the crust 
becomes toasty brown--and soon you're enjoying a slice of warm, home-baked
bread.<p>

Baking powder is a chemical leavening agent. Read the label on a baking powder 
product to learn what ingredients are present. Place a tablespoon of baking powder 
in your left hand. Now pour a tablespoon of water over the powder. What did you 
see, hear, and feel? Repeat this activity with baking soda and vinegar and compare 
the results.

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
The longest loaf of bread on record in the United States was baked in 1987 and 
was 718.4 meters (2,357' 10") long. Using a grocery store loaf as a model, 
estimate how many slices you could cut from this large loaf. How many sandwiches 
could you make? Compare how you arrived at your estimate with the methods used 
by other people in your group. With a calculator, find the actual number of 
sandwiches. How close was your estimate?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Chemical leavening depends on the neutralization between an acid and a base 
to make carbon dioxide gas, water, and a salt.  
ACID + BASE -----> CO2 + a SALT + H2O
Add a scoop of baking soda to a plastic cup and begin adding vinegar drop 
by drop until the solid has disappeared and bubble formation has stopped. 
Decide when the neutralization (end point when the acid and base are equal) 
is complete. How many drops did it take to neutralize the acid? Try other 
acids (lemon juice, soda, buttermilk) and compare. What does the number of 
drops say about acid concentration? Repeat the activity using milk instead 
of vinegar. What happens? What do the results say about the nature of milk?<p>

<p>

"London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down." We all know the first 
verse to that nursery rhyme. But have you ever heard this one: "Set a man to watch all 
night, watch all night, watch all night"? People once felt that a bridge required a 
human spirit. They sometimes buried a human sacrifice in the bridge's foundation, so 
that the spirit could "watch all night." Fortu-nately, we no longer sacrifice a night 
watchman when we build these structures. But there is still more to bridges than meets 
the eye.<p>

Bridge builders choose from one of several types of bridges or combine two or more. 
Three basic types are the arch, span, and suspension. The structural elements in a 
bridge are subjected to various <I><A NAME="compression">compression</A></I> and <I><A NAME="tension">tension</A></I> forces. Something bearing 
weight or being pushed together is under compression while something being pulled apart 
is under tension.
<p>
In an arch bridge, compression pushes the weight away from the arch and against the 
side walls and the stones of the arch itself. The Romans were first to build arch 
bridges, and some of their bridges and aqueducts still stand today. <p>

Span bridges consist of beams and/or trusses resting on supports or piers. When the 
<I><A NAME="span">span</A></I> length would require a very large or heavy beam to support the loads, a <I><A NAME="truss">truss</A></I> 
system is often used. Since a truss is composed of triangles (the strongest polygons 
because their shapes cannot be distorted), a truss bridge can support heavy loads with 
its relatively small weight.
<p>
A suspension bridge hangs from cables firmly anchored at each of its ends. Towers 
positioned at regular intervals along the span also support it. The main elements of 
suspension bridges, the cables, are in tension. The trusses hang from the cables and 
the trusses, in turn, support the deck. Trusses in these bridges provide stiffness to 
their <I><A NAME="deck">decks</A></I>. Suspension bridges are generally used for long spans.
<p>
<I><A NAME="engineer">Engineers</A></I> need to accommodate <I><A NAME="torsion">torsion</A></I> in their bridge designs. What causes a bridge to 
twist? Wind. An example of torsion was the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the state of 
Washington. A suspension bridge without open trusses, this bridge twisted in the breeze. 
One day, the bridge twisted so violently in the wind that its center span collapsed. 
Since then, engineers test bridge models in wind tunnels prior to construction and 
build their decks more stiffly. <p>

When determining what type of bridge to build, engineers evaluate terrain and length of 
span. In addition, bridges change as our needs and resources change. Engineers 
constantly look for ways to improve bridge designs and materials. During the recent 
earthquakes in California, for example, engineers analyzed highway overpasses to find 
ways to make them stronger. <br>

tension or  compression?

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
Engineers first create a blueprint and model of a bridge before they begin construction.  
Models enable them to test the design of their bridges. Often, engineering companies 
must compete to win a contract. For their presentations, they explain features of 
their designs with blueprints and models.<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<uL>
<li>  graph paper
<li>  pencils
<li>  poster board (2' x 3')--one sheet per group
<li>  scissors
<li> glue
<li>  tape
<li>  string</ul><p>
<ol>
<li>  Each group will design and build a freestanding bridge for a transportation system 
of the future. First decide what type of transportation will cross the bridge and what 
type of bridge you will build. Create a blueprint of the bridge on graph paper.
<li>  Using your blueprint, create a model of your bridge from the poster board. Each 
group is only allowed one sheet of poster board, so measure carefully before you cut. 
The only other materials you can use in the construction of your bridge are tape, glue, 
and string. 
<li>  Present your bridge to the large group. Explain the rationale behind your design. 
<li> With all the groups together, test the bridges for length, height, and
strength.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="bridges.gif">
<p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
For the individual groups:<ol>
<li>  How did you come up with the initial design for your bridge?
<li>  Did your design change as you built your bridge?
<li>  Which geometric shapes did you use in your bridge? Why?
<li>  How does the strength of the bridge compare to the weight of the bridge?
<li>  Would you make any changes in the design of your bridge?</ol><br>

For the large group:<ol>
<li>  Which bridge was the longest? Tallest? Strongest? Heaviest? Why?
<li>  What materials do you envision being used in future bridges?
<li>  How can computers help design bridges?</ol><hr>
<A NAME="try this"></A>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
The longest cable suspension bridge is 1,410 meters (4,626'). Because its towers stand 
exactly perpendicular to Earth's surface, they are 3.49 cm (1 3/8") out of parallel to 
allow for the Earth's curvature. In a plane, two lines perpendicular to the same line 
are parallel. Why does this change when you work with a curved surface? By the way, t
he Akashi-Kaikyo bridge in Japan, which will open in 1998, will be 1,990 meters (6,528'
) long!<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Test compression, tension, and torsion on different materials. First, take a strip of 
Styrofoam 10 cm x 38 cm (4" x 15"). Ask someone to hold the ends so you can press down 
gently on top to test compression. Hold each end and pull it apart to test tension. 
Hold the two ends and twist to test torsion. What were the results of your tests? Find 
materials that are strong in tension, weak in compression, and vice versa.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Concrete supports many of our bridges and overpasses. How is it holding up? Ice and 
road salt affect concrete bridges. Read "Concrete Solutions" by Gary Stix (Scientific 
American, April 1993) and "Inside the lab and out, concrete is more than it's cracked 
up to be" by Richard Wollomir (Smithsonian, January 1994). What are the pros and cons 
of building bridges with concrete? Why is it better than steel? What is reinforced 
concrete?
<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Invite a civil engineer to talk to your class about bridges. What types of bridges 
exist in your area? Which mathematics and science courses did the engineer take to 
prepare for a career in engineering? What tools do engineers use to design bridges and 
other structures?

<hr><center><B>DISCUSSION</B></center><p>
Ninety percent of cancers develop because of complex interactions between our
bodies, our lifestyles, our genetic makeup and our environment.  Scientists
have discovered different factors that cause cancer.  Research shows that
tobacco is estimated to cause 30 percent of all cancer deaths, poor diet 35
percent, reproductive and sexual behavior seven percent, work-related causes
four percent and the environment itself causes three percent.
<p>
Scientists believe that genetic changes, whether inherited or acquired, are the
basic cause of cancer.  Some scientific theories do suggest that cancer may be
a hereditary disease because each individual's make-up may make them more
susceptible to certain cancers.  About 50 of the more than 120 different types
of cancer occasionally run in families.
<p>
Most of the current scientific evidence indicates that a normal cell can become
transformed into a cancer cell when certain genes become activated.  Recent
work in cancer biology concerns the study of oncogenes, a specific gene that
participates in changing a normal cell into a cancer cell.  It is thought that
an oncogene might be present in an inactive form in normal cells and is some
way activated to create cancer cells.
<p>
As mentioned, the nature of a person's work or the working environment can also
be a factor in developing cancer.  The chart below identifies several
cancer-causing agents, occupations where this exposure occurs and the types of
cancers that can develop.

disease and the extent that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body.<p>

Most cancers are usually treated with a combination approach.  The main cancer
treatments include surgery to remove the cancerous cells, radiotherapy,
<A href="#chemotherapy">chemotherapy</A> and immunotherapy.  <p>

Surgery and radiotherapy are local treatments.  Both are used early in the
treatment of cancer or in combination later with other treatments. They work
best when the cancer cells have not spread too much within the body.  Surgery
may even be used after the cancer has advanced to relieve some of the symptoms
and reduce the mass of malignant cells.  Radiotherapy
uses X-rays and radium to
kill cancer cells.  Accelerator and betatron machines beam these rays at the
patients.<p>

Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are called systemic treatments because they can
act on cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy uses a variety of
anti-cancer drugs that keep the malignant cells from multiplying.  Effective
treatments involve finding the best combination of drugs to treat the patient.
Immunotherapy, also called biologic therapy, involves different types of
treatments that rely on manipulating a patient's immune system.  A relatively
new approach to cancer treatment, immunotherapy procedures increase the body's
natural ability to destroy malignant cells.<p>

Prevention and early diagnosis, however, will probably continue to be the most
effective ways to control cancer. There are a few strategies you can use to
lower your risk of cancer.  Eat a diet low in fat and high in fruit and grains,
refrain from tobacco products and avoid too much exposure to the ultraviolet
rays of the sun.<p>

<h3><center><b>
Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P>
In the "Newton's Apple" segment there are several people who have or have had
various forms of cancer.  Some people may not know exactly how to treat someone
who has cancer, especially at school.  Talk about how you would want to be
treated if you were diagnosed with cancer or some other illness.  Would you
want to talk about your illness and share your feelings with your
friends?</ol>

<B>Grow!  Stop Growing!</B><p>
With just the right combination you can control the growth of a foreign
substance.<p>
<p>
<B>Main Activity</B><p>
You can simulate how cancer develops by growing molds and then finding ways to
control their growth like cancer researchers do when they develop new
treatments for cancer.
<p>
Materials<p><ul>
<li>Several slices of white bread
<li>Orange sections
<li>Strawberries
<li>Jack or cheddar cheese
<li>Cantaloupe pieces
<li>10 small glass jars
<li>Penicillium
<li>Eye dropper</ul>
<p>
1.  Separate the jars into two groups of five each.  One set will be used for
the control group of samples which will not receive any special treatment.  The
other group will be used for the experimental group.  Label each group's jars
as "control" or "experimental".<p>
<img align=left src="Images/cancer.gif" hspace=10>
2.  Put a piece of each of the five foods into the five control jars and then
into the five experimental jars.  Label each jar with the name of the food that
is in it.<p>
3.  Make sure the experimental group of foods are kept under the same
conditions as the control group both before and during the activity.  Treat the
food in each of the five experimental jars with ten drops of penicillium.  The
jars should be left open.<p>
4.  Observe what happens to the food over a period of several weeks.  Check the
jars each day for changes and record your observations.  What effects does the
penicillium have on the mold growth on each food?<p>
5.   Analyze both the experimental and control groups.  Prepare a report
summarizing your findings.<p>
<p>
<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  How does your experiment with growing mold compare to how scientists try
and control cancer growth?  What medications can be used for controlling cancer
growth?<p>
2.  What type of foods contain molds that are not harmful?  Are other moldy
foods harmful and cancer-producing?<p>
4.  What types of experimental conditions are necessary to find cancer cures?<p>
5.  What branches of science are involved in the search for cancer cures?<p>
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
Find out how a patient's state of mind has an effect on the progress of the
disease and the success of the treatment.  Contact your local hospital to see
if you can visit an oncology ward. Learn about support groups and activities
for people with cancer.  What is the purpose of these programs?  Are they part
of the medical treatments of cancer?<p>
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
Discover how the study of genetics and the discovery of DNA made significant
contributions to the early detection of cancer and helped to develop treatments
for malignant cells.  What other diseases and treatment have been discovered as
a result of these scientific advances?<p>
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
Conduct a classroom panel discussion of different points of view concerning
effective and ineffective cancer treatments.  Find out if other countries have
different cancer treatments than the United States.  Why might U.S. physicians
choose not to use these other treatments?<p>
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
Invite an oncologist or cancer specialist from your community to come to your
class for a discussion of cancer treatments.  Find out which kind of cells are
affected by chemotherapy.  When might radiotherapy be chosen as a treatment?
Learn how early detection of cancer is important to successful treatment.  Ask
the doctor about steps you can take to prevent cancer.<p><p>

How do tightrope walkers keep their balance?<br>

Dave tries to find his balance for a high-wire act.<BR>
Segment length: 6:15<P>

<img align=Middle hspace=0 src="../stills/apples.gif" width=30 height=37 alt="*">
<a name="1"><font size=+2>Insights</font></a>
<p>

Imagine yourself 20 meters (66 feet) above the ground on a platform, as thousands
of faces watch and wait for you <A HREF="#55">to style</A>. Now imagine taking a step, with only a
1/2-inch metal wire between you and the ground. Welcome to the world of high
wire.<P>
High wire's roots are as old as ancient Egypt and first century China, where the
art of &quot;rope dancing&quot; was performed over knives. In the 1850s, Jean
Francois Gravelet received world acclaim for cooking and eating an omelette
(complete with stove and neatly set table) on a high wire stretched over Niagara
Falls.<P>
Three different types of <A HREF="#22">funambulism</A> have evolved. Slack wire, where the rope or
wire hangs a bit loose, is popular for juggling, clowning, and sword fights.
Sloped wires are attached to the ground at one end and to a pole at the other,
creating an angle of about 40 degrees. The most popular of all is the high-wire
act, where a taut, springy wire is used to launch dizzying acrobatic tricks and
phenomenal feats of balancing. <P>
One way to view the high-wire act is to see the wire as an axis and the center of
mass of the performer as having the potential to rotate about the axis. If the
<A HREF="#11">center of mass</A> is not directly above the wire, gravity will cause the performer
to begin to rotate about the wire. If this is not corrected, the performer will
fall.<p>
The artist often carries a balancing pole that may be as long as 12 meters (39
feet) and weighs up to 14 kilograms (31 pounds). This pole increases the
rotational <A HREF="#33">inertia</A> of the artist, which allows more time to move his or her
center of mass back to the desired position directly over the wire. This effect
can be magnified by making the pole as long as possible and by weighting its
ends.<P>
The pole also helps balance the funambulist by lowering the center of gravity.
High-wire artists use drooping, rather than rigid, balance poles. It's possible,
in fact, to have such heavy weights attached to the ends of a long, drooping pole
that the center of gravity of the performer/pole system is below the wire. In
this case, the performer would require no more sense of balance than a person
hanging from the wire.<P>
Acrobats train for years and use <A HREF="#44">mechanics</A> to safely develop routines. Although a
high-wire performance may seem like a combination of courage and magic, remember
that there's a lot of work and good, old-fashioned physics thrown into the
balance as well!<P>

<BR>

<P>
Make your dreams of running away to join the circus come true-at least for a
little while. In this activity, you'll construct a tightrope setup, learn the
basics of tightrope walking, and understand a little more about the physics
behind balancing! Get an adult to help you build the setup, as well as to
double-check cushioning and spot you as you learn.<P>
Materials<BR>
<ul>
<li>one 8'-long two-by-four board<BR>
<li>two 4'-long two-by-four boards<BR>
<li>two smooth poles, one about 3' long, the other about 6'
(The length doesn't have to be exact, so long as the two sticks have about 3' difference between them.)<BR>
<li>sandpaper<BR>
<li>hammer<BR>
<li>3&quot; nails<BR>
<li>soft, grassy area or cushioned mats<BR>
<li>2 half-gallon plastic jugs filled with water<BR>
<li>broom<BR>
<li>50 cm (20&quot;) of string or cord cut into two equal
lengths<P>
</ul>
<img align=right hspace-5 src="illustrations/hgwire.gif">
<ol>
<li>Place the two-by-fours on their thinner edges, forming an H (see
illustration). Center and nail the shorter boards onto the ends of the longest
two-by-four. Sand down the entire surface, making sure there are no rough edges
or slivers.<BR>
<li>Place your &quot;tightrope&quot; on the soft, grassy area. If you put it on
cushioned mats, make sure there is enough padded area to protect your entire body
if you fall. <BR>
<li>First, try walking from end to end very slowly. Where do you find yourself
holding your hands and arms? Try holding them still-first straight out from your
body, then overhead, then stiff by your sides. How do these different positions
affect your balance? Why? Try these same positions holding a filled plastic milk
jug in each hand. Does the added weight make balancing easier or harder? Why?<BR>
<li>Try walking your tightrope with your longer pole. Move your hands together
until they touch in the middle of the pole and walk the tightrope holding the
pole horizontally. Now spread your hands as far apart as possible on the pole and
walk the tightrope again. Does your hand position affect your ability to balance?
How? Why? Try the two hand positions again with a broom. Is there any difference?
Why?<BR>
<li>Using the hand position you found to be the best for balancing, try walking
your tightrope first with your short pole, then with your long pole. Which length
helps you balance better? Why?<BR>
<li>Tie the filled plastic milk jugs to the ends of your long pole and walk the
tightrope again. Do the weights affect your balancing ability? How? Why?<BR>
<li>Using the short pole, walk across your tightrope. What happens to the pole
when you start to lose your balance? What happens to your body? Can you use the
pole to deliberately make yourself lose your balance?<BR>
<li>Add some tricks to your repertoire. Try walking backwards from end to end,
balancing on one foot, or turning around on one foot. Can you think of other
tricks you can add with practice? (Here are a couple ideas-try stepping over your
balancing pole, or playing with a hula hoop.)<BR>
</ol>
Question<BR>
1.  What combination of factors gave you the best balance? Why? <P>

<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif"></a>
<br clear=left>

Here's a simple model to help you understand how center of balance and
counterbalances work: Take a piece of string about 30 cm (1') in length and form
it into a circle. Take a ruler and a hammer and assemble them together as shown.
Balance the end of the ruler against the edge of a table with the hammer hanging
below. Where is the center of balance? Why does this look like it shouldn't
work?<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
Hold a large book in your hands. Have a friend gently try to disturb your
balance. Now hold the book in different locations. Which location makes it
easiest for you to keep your balance? Why?<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
Stand on a pillow in a safe, open, soft area. Can you balance on one foot? Now
put on a blindfold. How does that affect your sense of balance?<P>

<h1>Cockroaches</h1>
How do they get into our houses and how can we get them out?<br>
<hr>
</center>
David goes to new depths to explore the life of a cockroach.<br>
Segment length:  7:36<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Cockroaches.  We humans consider them the "rats of the insect world," yet
cockroaches could be considered one of the most successful creatures on earth.
<a href="#five">Entomologists</a> have found fossilized cockroaches that are more than 300 million
years old.  Amazingly enough, these fossilized cockroaches look very similar to
the ones scurrying around in our yards and homes today.
<p>
There are over 4,000 species of cockroaches.  As one of nature's recyclers,
they are often found eating natural forest debris.  A few find their way into
our kitchens, basements, and bathrooms, coming up through the drains, sneaking
in through cracks, or carried in on grocery bags.  These cockroaches are
usually looking for warm, moist, dark places to call home.
<p>
Cockroaches, by design, are survivors.  They are <a href="#six">nocturnal</a>, making them hard to
spot.  If they are discovered, their flat bodies make it easy for them to
escape into small crevices.  Their <a href="#one">antennae</a> and <a href="#four">cerci</a> help them detect changes
in vibrations and air pressure, making it difficult to even step on them.
Cockroaches are <a href="#seven">omnivorous</a>.  They eat anything from dog food to plaster.
Internal <a href="#two">bacteria</a> help cockroaches digest these unusual meals.  If necessary,
cockroaches can live for three months without food and one month without
water.
<p>
Although cockroaches preen regularly, they are still suspected of transmitting
diseases such as salmonella, dysentery, and typhus.  They are also suspected of
causing allergic reactions in half of the 17 million people afflicted with
asthma.
<p>
Have cockroaches appeared in your home?  Implement an Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) program.  First, start by making the site less attractive to
cockroaches by storing food in tight containers and maintaining high sanitary
standards.  Then, if you must use pesticides, read the warning labels
carefully.  Traps and <a href="#three">boric acid</a> can be used instead of highly-toxic sprays.
Although an IPM is a safer approach for the environment, following it probably
won't enable you to get rid of cockroaches completely.  Remember, cockroaches
have been around for 300 million years.  They are sure to be around for a long
time to come.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>
1.  Most cockroaches originated in Africa.  Now they are found in all parts of
the world.  How might this spread of cockroaches have occurred?<br>
2.  You have just found cockroaches in your home.  What will you do?

its side.  Create a miniature ramp using the cardboard strip or tongue
depressor, extending the ramp from the floor to the container.<p>
<li>If you catch a few cockroaches, quickly screw the lid on tightly.  You
don't want any cockroaches to escape.  Notify the building authorities of your
discovery.
<p>
</ol>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  What plan would you suggest to help get rid of the cockroaches at your
specific site?  What experiments can you devise to see how well your plan
works?<p>
2.  Compare your cockroaches with those caught by your classmates.  Are they
the same types of cockroaches or are they different?  Try to identify them.

What repels a cockroach?  Experiment by putting a piece of bread in one end of
a box and adding a cockroach.  How long does it take for the cockroach to start
eating the bread?  Then, place a piece of peeled garlic into the box.  Observe.
Is the cockroach attracted to the garlic or repelled by it?  Try bay leaves or
cucumbers.  Does your cockroach say "No thanks!" to these?  Experiment with
other foods.

Get out the calculators.  A female German cockroach reproduces four to eight
times in its life cycle, laying seven to eight egg cases, each case containing
35 to 40 eggs.  About how many offspring might one female German cockroach
have?  Divide students into groups to solve the problem.  Give each group a
package of kidney beans to predict how many cockroaches their female would
produce.  Put all the beans together to see the effects of cockroach
reproduction.<p>

Find out how smart a cockroach can be.  Design a cockroach maze.  Start with a
baking pan half-filled with water.  Build a maze using several
6-oz. cans and strips of cardboard.  Arrange the cans in the pan and place the
cardboard strips on top of the cans to create two pathways.  One pathway leads
to the cockroach's home, the other leads to a dead-end.  Put your cockroach at
the start of the maze and observe.

<p><BR>

It's been used as a medicine and an ingredient in wine. It's been linked with
revolutionary ideas. First a food, later a beverage, coffee contributed
significantly to the economic health of countries that controlled it. The
coffeehouses in the Middle East and Europe that sprang up because of it became
centers of intellectual ferment, often frowned upon by the authorities.<P>
Native to Ethiopia, this crop is now grown around the world and is a major
<A HREF="#one">commodity</A> in the world economy. The principal species, Coffea arabica, thrives at
high elevations in a moist, mild climate where there is partial shade. That's why
most of the big coffee producers are located in mountainous countries near the
equator. <P>
The coffee tree is a shrublike plant with glossy, dark-green leaves and small,
white, fragrant flowers. The fruit, or cherry, is initially green and gradually
ripens to a dark red. Although people used to eat the coffee cherries or chew the
coffee leaves, the principal interest now is in the coffee seeds or beans.<P>
Removal of the fruit from the beans requires several steps and considerable water
because the inner part of the fruit is so sticky. Processors first pulp and wash
the cherries, and then allow them to ferment before washing them again. During
<A HREF="#two">fermentation</A>, microorganisms act on the sticky inner layer of the cherry to break
it down. Finally, the seeds are dried, and a <A HREF="#three">hulling</A> machine crushes the
remaining parchment covering so it can be removed. The seeds-now called green
coffee beans-can be roasted in several different ways. <P>
To prepare coffee, people brew the ground-roasted beans with hot water, a process
that extracts flavor and fragrance chemicals. Only those chemicals that are
soluble in hot water dissolve to make the coffee. The coffee grounds are left
behind. One chemical naturally present in coffee is caffeine, which is a mild
stimulant. But many different chemicals are manufactured by the coffee plant, and
other chemicals are created in the <A HREF="#four">roasting</A> process.<P>
Most coffee flavor comes from roasting-green coffee beans smell and taste
completely different from roasted ones. Caffeine can be extracted from the beans
to make decaffeinated coffee without altering the flavor much, since caffeine
itself has very little flavor.<P>

Extract and blend fragrances to make one that appeals to you.<br>

<BR>
<P><BR>

<BR>
<P>
Flavors and fragrances play a large part in our daily lives. We add spices to
food to make it taste and smell good, and put perfume on ourselves to make us
more attractive. We tend to avoid unpleasant odors. Most flavors and fragrances
are not single chemicals but mixtures of several substances. Coffee is usually
blended from various types of beans to obtain a pleasant taste. Experienced
coffee tasters can tell where specific kinds of coffee come from just by
taste.<P>
<img align=right hspace-5 src="illustrations/coffee.gif">
Flavor and fragrance experts talk about &quot;notes&quot; of scent-fruity,
flowery, aromatic, earthy, musky, and so on. Some odors are unpleasant in large
amounts, but smell good in small amounts or when mixed with other scents. Coffee,
for example, contains sulfur compounds that are unpleasant by themselves, but
that smell pleasant in the aroma of coffee. Most perfumes are specific blends of
fragrance notes. <BR>
<b>Materials</b><BR>
<ul>
<li>odoriferous materials such as flowers, spices, pine needles
or chips, sage and mint leaves, and fruits (Caution! Not all
of these materials are edible, so stick to fragrance, not
taste.)<BR>
<li>hot water<BR>
<li>mortar and pestle<BR>
<li>small beaker<BR>
<li>funnel<BR>
<li>filter paper<BR>
<li>medicine droppers<BR>
<li>small screw-top bottles for storing the extracts<P>
</ul>
1.  Using the mortar and pestle, grind the material you are testing into a
pulp.<BR>
2.  Place the material in the beaker and soak with hot water. Be careful when
handling the hot water.<BR>
3.  After stirring the material in the hot water, set up the funnel with filter
paper. Pour the mixture into the filter paper and collect the filtrate (extract)
in a screw-top bottle. Label the bottle with the source of the extract.
Manufacture as many different extracts as time allows.<BR>
4.  Mix small portions of various extracts to make new fragrances. Experiment
with a variety of combinations. Can you design your own personal fragrance with
particular &quot;notes&quot;?<BR>
5.  Health food stores often sell essential oils from various plants. What other
scents would you like to obtain to add to your mixture?<P>

Too much caffeine makes people jittery and irritable. In larger quantities it can
be poisonous. Decaffeination removes the caffeine from coffee and other
beverages. One type uses carbon dioxide under so much pressure that it becomes a
semi-liquid called a supercritical fluid. Find out about other decaffeination
processes. How will you plan your research?<P>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">

<BR>

Try your hand at economic botany. By studying back issues of the Wall Street
Journal, Business Week, or other financial publications, track the weather in
Brazil and the price of coffee. Can you graph these two things on a yearly or
semi-annual basis? Does there seem to be a relationship between weather and
price? What other environmental events might influence the price of coffee or
other commodities?<P>

<p>

You may have heard milk described as "nature's most perfect food."
That's because it contains three main nutrients--protein, calcium, and
riboflavin--essential for bones and teeth to grow, body tissues to
repair themselves, and antibodies to form.
<p>
Milking techniques and <A HREF="#milkprocessing"><i>milk processing</i></A> have changed a lot since
Christopher Columbus brought the first cattle to the Western Hemisphere
in 1493. Advancements such as automatic milking machines and computers
have improved milk production, safety, and availability.
<p>
Milk production begins with the cow. A mature cow eats, on average, 50
pounds of silage and drinks 25 to 50 gallons of water a day. A cow
initially chews just enough to swallow. The food goes into the first
chamber (called the rumen) of its four-part stomach. Later, the cow
burps up small amounts of food and chews it again. The food then goes
into the next chamber (reticulum) before passing through the final two
chambers (abomasum and omasum), where bacteria and stomach acids work on
it. Food provides cows with protein, energy, vitamins, minerals, and
bulk. It is also the raw material that makes milk. However, to begin
producing milk, a cow must first give birth. The hormones released at
birth and the sucking of the calf stimulate the cow to lactate (produce
milk) for her calf. Cows produce the greatest amount of milk right after
they give birth. If a cow is not milked, she will stop producing milk.
<p>
Milk is made and stored in the cow's udder, which is divided into four
separate quarters, each having its own milk supply. When laden with
milk, each section can be drained through one <A HREF="#teat"><i>teat</i></A>. First the farmer
spray-washes the cow's udder with a warm iodine solution to control
diseases. The milking machine cups are then attached and draw the milk
from the udder into a system of pipes that transports the warm milk to a
large storage tank for cooling. This milk is known as <A HREF="#rawmilk"><i>raw milk</i></A>.
<p>
A trucker comes to the farm to collect and transport the raw milk to a
processing plant. At the plant, milk is tested for acceptable levels of
bacteria, and <A HREF="#pasteurization"><i>pasteurized</i></A> by heating it to 77*C (170*F), then cooling
it. This kills any harmful bacteria that may be in the milk.
<p>
During processing, butterfat is skimmed from the milk. The butterfat is
then forced through small holes. This breaks it up into very tiny
globules which will stay mixed evenly with the milk. <A HREF="#butterfat"><i>Butterfat</i></A> is then
added back into the milk in proper proportions to produce skim, 2%,
whole, and other types of milk. This process is called <A HREF="#homogenize">homogenization</A>.
<p>
Once homogenization is completed, the milk goes into big storage tanks
where it is cooled. It is agitated and then put into bottles or cartons
for delivery. The total time from cow to shelf is 48 to 96 hours!

 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Cryogenics is a branch of physics concerned with very low temperatures:  how to
produce the lowest temperatures possible (below minus 30oC), and what effects
these low temperatures have on organisms or materials.  The prefix cryo is
derived from the Greek word kryos, meaning "cold."
<p>
The person considered by most to be the originator of modern experimental
science, Francis Bacon, died as a result of a spontaneous experiment he was
conducting on the effects of low temperatures.  In 1623, while traveling on a
cold and snowy day, Bacon decided to "experiment" to see whether snow would
delay the putrefaction of flesh.  He stuffed a fowl with snow to observe the
effects.  In the process, he caught a sudden chill.  Over the years, this
turned into acute bronchitis, which contributed to his death in 1626. <p>
Although some animals are able to lower their body temperatures during
<a href="#one">hibernation</a>, most animals, like people, cannot tolerate freezing temperatures
within their body tissues.  Normally, when an organism is exposed to
below-freezing temperatures, ice forms in smaller blood vessels and either
bursts the blood vessels or stretches them beyond the point where they can
function normally.  In addition, ice in the blood vessels "captures" the water
content, making it impossible for the blood cells to survive.  Other types of
cells are also damaged during freezing.  Frostbite is a common malady caused by
cold temperatures;  frozen skin and blood cells are damaged from the
dehydration due to freezing.  
<p>
Scientists have discovered, however, that some varieties of frogs and turtles
can actually survive being frozen.  When these animals sense ice on the
outsides of their bodies, their livers produce extra glucose (blood sugar),
which floods into their cells to protect the cell from freezing and from
damage.  This also holds the cell's shape so it doesn't collapse upon itself.
Nucleating proteins "guide" water out of the cells, allowing the water to go in
between the cells and the organs.  This allows the water to freeze, but in
small pieces, without "spears" that could puncture the cell membrane.
<p>
Scientists know of only one mammal, the Arctic ground squirrel, that seems to
be able to tolerate ice crystals in its bloodstream during a physiological
state that falls somewhere between hibernation and freezing.
<p>
Scientists are studying the "cryoprotectants" of these animals to see whether
they have application for the freezing of human organs for transplants.  So far
they have been successful in freezing only single cells (e.g., sperm cells) and
corneas for transplants.

<h1>Diabetes</h1>
What is type I diabetes?<br>
<hr>
</center>
Peggy travels to the Mayo Clinic to learn about diabetes.<br>
Segment length:  6:08
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
<a href="#four">Diabetes mellitus</a> and its complications affect over 12 million people in this
country -- that's one in 20 Americans -- and five million adults don't even know
they have the disease.
<p>
The segment shows Dane, who has type I diabetes, the kind of diabetes in which
the pancreas secretes little or no insulin.   Dane's body breaks down
<a href="#two">carbohydrates</a> into <a href="#three">glucose</a>, but because he 
doesn't have enough <a href="#five">insulin</a>, the
glucose can't leave the bloodstream and get into his body's cells.  The blood
carrying this excess sugar passes through the kidneys and causes an increased
loss of body fluids.  This need for replacement fluids leaves Dane feeling
excessively thirsty.  To feel good and live an active life, Dane injects
insulin twice a day, tests his blood sugars, and balances his diet and
exercise.
<p>
The cause of type I diabetes is not known for certain.  The greatest evidence
points to an autoimmune process that destroys the insulin-producing <a href="#one">beta cells</a>
in the <a href="#seven">pancreas</a>.  It is unclear whether diabetes is inherited, but it is
believed that some individuals may be genetically susceptible to getting
diabetes.  In these susceptible individuals, an environmental factor such as a
viral infection may trigger the autoimmune process that leads to type I
diabetes.  Type II diabetes, in which the body makes insulin but not enough, is
associated with advancing age and obesity.
<p>
Almost all cases of type I diabetes occur before the age of 40, with a peak
incidence of around age 14.  However, of all the people who have diabetes, only
about 10% are type I;  the rest are type II.  Many people with type II diabetes
don't have to inject insulin, but can control it by eating properly or taking
medications that stimulate insulin production.  Both types of diabetes,
however, require balancing acts:  Diet must be varied; food intake must be
scheduled; and sugar consumption must be moderate.
<p>
Promising medical advancements may make life for those with diabetes easier and
less restrictive.  Pancreatic transplants and <a href="#six">Islets of Langerhans</a> 
transplants might eliminate the need for insulin injections for some patients;
computer-controlled blood-sugar monitoring and insulin administration may
improve the day-to-day lives of many people who have diabetes.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>
Consider this statement from Diabetes Management:  The Balancing Act  (see
Resources):  "Diabetes, in the end, plays no larger a part in the lives of . .
. people than they have chosen to give it.  They choose instead to live their
lives in balance."
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>

biochemical structure containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; includes sugars and
starches<br>
<b><a name="three">glucose</a></b> the sugar derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates and

<center>
<h1>It's Not My Fault!</h1>
Find out more about the causes of diabetes.
</center>
<p>
This card game will help students understand the cause-and-effect relationships
of diabetes, that those with type I diabetes are not responsible for having
diabetes, and that there is treatment.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>3" x 5" notecards OR a pad of removable sticky notes<br>
<li>pencils or pens<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>On separate cards, list plausible causes of diabetes, symptoms, statements
for understanding it, and treatments, along with some inaccurate ideas about
the causes of diabetes.  Use the INSIGHTS and VOCABULARY sections as resources
for your listings.  Here are some examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>I ate too much sugar.<br>
<li>White blood cells didn't attack a germ that got into my body, so the germ
was able to attack my pancreas.<br>
<li>I didn't behave in class.<br>
<li>My stomach stopped making insulin.<br>
<li>I am overweight.<br>
<li>I caught it from another diabetic.<br>
<li>Islets of Langerhans are clusters of cells found in the pancreas that
secrete insulin<p>
</ul>
<li>Make enough cards so that there is one for each student.  You may duplicate
information on more than one card, but do not make more than three cards with
any one fact.<p>
<li>Divide the class into four teams.  Have each student chose a card and take
it back to his or her team.  The objective is for each team to gather a set of
cards that correctly explains how diabetes comes about, its symptoms, and
treatment.  <p>
<li>RULES:  Any member may trade a card with a member of another team.  There
can be only one member per team on his or her feet at any one time.  Set a time
limit, or play until one team gets a complete set of cards and wins.  The
winning team must explain the statements on its set of cards.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  Why is it important to realize that type I diabetes is not caused by a
person's actions or by "catching it"?  What health problems are a direct result
of individual behaviors and choices?<p>
2.  If you had diabetes, what would you have to do differently?  What if you
had just taken your shot of insulin and had eaten your dinner, and then you
were invited out for pizza?  What if you were so tired, you wanted to sleep
until noon on Saturdays?
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Many people who have any kind of permanent disease or ailment don't like to be
labeled with the name of the disease.  They may prefer to say, "I have
diabetes," rather than, "I am a diabetic."  Why is this semantic difference
important to consider?  How might this be extended to "epileptics,"
"paraplegics," or "asthmatics"?
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Invite some people who have diabetes into your classroom to view the segment
with the class.  If possible, your guests might be willing to show how they
inject insulin and test for blood-sugar levels.<p>
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
List on the board the following famous people who have or had diabetes:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bret Michaels, rock vocalist <br>
<li>Jackie Robinson, major-league baseball player<br>
<li>Ernest Hemingway, writer<br>
<li>Mary Tyler Moore, actress<br>
<li>Wade Wilson, professional football player
</ul>
Are there more?  Are there famous people with epilepsy?  Arthritis?  Learning
differences?  Does this information matter?

<h1>Diet and Nutrition</h1>
What is the nutritional value of different foods?<br>
<hr>
</center>
David gets some nutritional advice to help answer every mother's question, "Are
you eating right, Honey?"<br>
Segment length:  6:50
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
"You are what you eat."  There's a lot of truth to this old clich&eacute;.
What we eat and how much plays a big role in how healthy we feel.  Culture also
plays a role in how we feel about our bodies.  Although healthy bodies come in
a variety of shapes, many Americans hold ideal body images few can match.
Teenagers are particularly susceptible to the myth of the perfect body, e.g., a
thin body, or a muscle-bound physique.<p>
For many teenagers, this is the time of rapid growth, yet the rate of eating
disorders such as <a href="#one">anorexia nervosa</a> and <a href="#two">bulimia</a> for this age group have
increased at alarming rates.  Understanding basic nutrition and accepting our
individual bodies are critical steps to good health.<p>
<a href="#five">Carbohydrates</a>, <a href="#six">fats</a>, <a href="#eight">proteins</a>, 
<a href="#nine">vitamins</a>, and <a href="#seven">minerals</a> are the basic nutritional
building blocks that provide the fuel our bodies need to function and perform.
Carbohydrates, such as breads, cereals, and sugar, are our main source of quick
energy.  Fats, whether solid or liquid, are our primary slow-burning energy
sources.  Proteins, both complete and incomplete, are the body's chief building
materials.  Essential vitamins and minerals are also found in many of the foods
we eat.<p>
Obtaining the right proportion of nutrients is critical to our health.  Eating
the right number of <a href="#three">calories</a> is just as important.  Ideally, our caloric intake
should equal the total amount of energy our bodies need for growth and repair.
Using a <a href="#four">calorimeter</a>, nutritionists have calculated the caloric energy of
particular foods.  This information, and the product's ingredients, are listed
on most food packages.<p>
Keeping your body healthy is a personal balancing act.  The goal is to get the
essential nutrients you need, while eating no more calories than your body
expends.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>
1.  What influences you the most in what you eat?  Friends?  Television?
Family patterns?  Societal ideals?<br>

<h1>Lunch at Fast-Food Freddy's</h1>
Find out the nutritional value of fast-food.<br>
</center>
<p>
One fast-food meal, heavy in calories and fat, can be balanced by eating other
nutritious meals during the day.  But, too many fast-food meals can throw your
body out of balance.  You will figure out the nutritional values of foods to
understand the nature of a healthy diet.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>nutrition-information pamphlets from national fast-food restaurants<br>
<li>graphic of Fast-Food Freddy's cash register<br>
<li>calculator (optional)<br>
<li>description or illustration of the food pyramid<br>
<li>calorie-count information for males and females by age group<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Select some students to collect nutrition information from their favorite
fast-food restaurants.  Or, refer to the Resources section for books that
contain this information.<p>
<li>Share the cash-register graphic with your students and ask them to order
their favorite lunch from Fast-Food Freddy's.  Make a list of each order.<p>
<li>Using the fast-food restaurant's nutrition information, have students
determine the approximate number of calories, fat, protein, and carbo-hydrates
from their imaginary lunches.<p>
<li>Review the food pyramid.  Which foods should eat the most of on a daily
basis?  Which foods the least? <p>
<li>Referring to the fast-food nutrition pamphlets, ask students to reorder
their lunch from Freddy's, substituting foods with fewer calories and fats.<p>
<li>Divide students into groups.  Assign each group a popular fast-food
restaurant and determine a nutritional meal using the actual nutrition
information from that restaurant.  Remind students to pay particular attention
to the amount of fat and calories for each food item.  Have students present
their menus to the class and explain their choices.<p>
</ol>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  What fast foods do you eat regularly?  What are the calorie and fat
contents of these foods?  What satisfying substitutes might you choose that
have less fat and fewer calories?  <p>
2.  If you ate a fast-food lunch everyday, what would you have for breakfast
and dinner to make your entire daily-food intake well-balanced and
nutritional?
<p>

<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Does advertising influence your choices of foods?  Record on audio tape or
videotape a food commercial.  As a class, listen to or watch the tape, and then
discuss the commercial's effectiveness.  Buy the advertised food and study the
nutritional label on the package.  Is it really as good as the commercial says
it is?
<p>

<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Compare the nutritional value of meals from various cultures.  Calculate the
total calories and nutritional content of a typical American meal.  Look
through ethnic cookbooks and create dinner menus that reflect Chinese, Mexican,
and Italian meals.  Tally the total calories and nutritional content of these
dinners.  Which meal might be the healthiest?

<p>
Trying to understand why the dinosaurs became extinct has become one of the great 
geological detective stories. Some recent findings from the small Mexican village of 
Chicxulub have given scientists new hope that the answer may soon be known. <p>

The story starts a little over 15 years ago in the town of Gubbio, Italy, where 
geologist Walter Alvarez was collecting sediment from a layer of rock which marked the 
boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary time periods. Geologists had long known 
that this boundary was important because it marked a period in the Earth's history, 
some 65 million years ago, when almost half of all known species suddenly disappeared, 
including the dinosaurs.<p>

Walter brought some of his sample back to the United States and his father, Nobel 
prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, analyzed it for any unusual chemicals. To their 
surprise, the sample showed a high concentration of the element iridium, a substance 
rare on Earth but common in <A NAME="meteorite"><I>meteorites</A></I>. To make
sure there was nothing unusual about  the Gubbio sample, they analyzed other
K-T boundary <A NAME=""strata><I>strata</A></I> from around the world. They 
found extra iridium in these samples as well. Using the average thickness of the clay 
as a guide, they calculated a meteorite would require a diameter of about 10 
kilometers (6 miles) to produce this much iridium.<p>

If a meteorite that size had hit Earth, the results could explain the extinction of 
dinosaurs. The dust thrown up in the air would have caused major climatic changes to 
which many animals could not rapidly adapt. A major problem with this theory, however, 
was that a 10-kilometer meteorite would leave a very large <A NAME="crater"><I>crater</A></I>, between 150 and 200  kilometers (93-124 miles) in diameter. While Earth has many impact craters on the 
surface, few are even close to this size. <p>

Because 65 million years had passed since the hypothetical impact, scientists decided 
to shift the search underground. A crater that old would almost certainly have been 
filled in. Just by chance, a Mexican oil company drilling off the coast of Yucatan 
discovered what appeared to be a crater about one kilometer (0.6 miles) under the 
surface near the village of Chicxulub. When <A NAME="core"><I>core</A></I>
samples were analyzed, they showed  the crater to be about 180 kilometers (112 miles) in diameter and 65 million years 
old. Was this the cause of the dinosaurs' extinction? The jury is still out, but 
evidence strongly suggests that the case of the disappearing dinosaurs may finally be 
solved.<br>

Because many geological features like craters are buried, geologists must find ways of 
probing beneath Earth's surface to understand what's there. Since it would be too 
expensive to simply dig one big hole, geologists do the next best thing--they drill 
long, slim holes and correlate the sections. In this activity, you can try your hand 
at unmasking a hidden geological structure.

<h3>Materials</h3>
<UL>
<LI>a cardboard shoe box
<LI>4 or 5 colors of plastic modeling clay, about 1 lb of each
<LI>25 wide plastic straws
<LI>small, sharp scissors
<LI>a metric ruler
<li>2 blank pieces of paper and a pencil</UL>

<ol><li>  Before starting this exercise, someone must create a geological
structure in   the  shoe box. Begin by placing layers of clay, each a different color, one on top of each 
other in the box. Vary the thicknesses of the layers. In the middle of the box, either 
create a crater by cutting out a circular depression or make a dome by burying a big 
ball of one clay color in the different layers. Once the structure has been completed, 
give it to the students doing the drilling.
 <li> To "drill" the structure, slowly insert one plastic straw into the top
 and   push it  down all the way to the bottom of the box. Before removing the straw, measure the 
exact location of the core relative to two sides of the box and mark that point on 
the blank paper. Label it "core 1."
 <li> After marking the core location, slowly remove the straw. The clay should
  stay  inside. With the scissors, carefully cut the straw lengthwise, starting at the bottom. 
Try not to disturb the clay inside. Using the ruler, start at the bottom of the straw 
and measure the thickness of each color of clay. Draw this on the second piece of 
paper and label it "core 1."
 <li> After marking the first core, take a second straw and repeat steps 2 and
 3   in a  second location. Continue until you have drilled, located, and measured 20 cores. 
Based on the location of the cores and the clay layers in each one, see if you can 
reconstruct a three-dimensional model of the geology in the shoe box. When you think 
you have done it, peel away the sides of the box and see how close you
came.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="dinoextn.gif"><p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<OL>
<LI> Based on this exercise, how might increasing or decreasing the number of straws 
you use change the accuracy of your coring model?
<LI> When you are cutting open your straws, what error factors must you consider?
<LI> Besides coring, what other methods might geologists use to "look inside" Earth?
<LI> What hazards might a drill team encounter if they were drilling rock instead of 
clay?</OL><hr>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Go to a local museum or planetarium and check out some meteorite exhibits. How do the 
meteorites differ? What's the largest one researchers have found and where is it 
located?

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Meteorite impact is only one theory used to explain the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
Do a little research and see what other extinction theories are being offered. Are 
any of them valid? Hold a debate with your friends and discuss these

While the Chicxulub crater is a large one, it's not the only impact site on Earth. 
Research other impact sites in the United States and the world. Are any of these 
possible candidates for a dino crater as well? Do any of them support the idea of a 
multiple meteorite impact?<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Try making a model meteorite bombing range by using marbles of different sizes and a 
large baking dish filled with about an inch of flour. Try dropping the marbles from 
different angles and at different speeds and see what types of patterns develop. How 
might this activity be used to tell the age of craters on the moon?<hr>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Paleontology is the science of discovering and analyzing <A href="#fossil>fossils</A> to decipher
the history of life on earth.  Most often a fossil is the hard part of an
animal like its bones, teeth or shell.  Sometimes, the fossil is just the hard
parts and sometimes it is the hard or soft parts hardened by minerals.<p>

Paleontologists invented a special calendar called a geological time chart to
outline the history of the Earth.  During most of the Mesozoic era-between 200
million and 60 million years ago-great animals called dinosaurs were the
dominant land animals.  <p>

Dinosaur fossils are often found when rock is mined, when nature exposes them
by land movements and erosion, during scientific <A href="#excavation">excavations</A> and by amateur
fossil-hunters, who stumble onto something curious.  Skulls and teeth are more
frequently found than other parts because of their solid and hard
characteristics.  Sometimes softer parts, such as ribs, bones or skin can be
found if they have been protected from rapid decay and mineralization.<p>

To excavate a fossil, scientists establish coordinates over an excavation site.
Using a variety of techniques from dynamiting and digging, covering the entire
area in a plaster cast for transport to laboratories and cleaning with small
picks and brushes, they preserve the dinosaur's fossils.<p>

Dating the fossils is an important aspect of the scientist's work.  There are
three ways paleontologists determine the age of a fossil.  One is studying how
deeply the fossil was buried.  Another is using chronometric techniques
(chrono=time, metric=measurement) which include Carbon-14 and Potassium-Argon
dating.  The third dating method looks at the Earth's magnetic field and its
patterns in history.  When these fields are preserved in rock, they leave a
pattern that is unique for each span of geologic time.<hr>

<B>Dig It!</B><p>
Investigate ways paleontologists discover and analyze fossils to decipher the
history of life on Earth.  <p>
<B>Main Activity</B><p>
You and your fellow students will work cooperatively as "paleontologists" to
investigate and excavate "fossil" bones in a miniature classroom dig site.
Prepare several boxes as dig sites (approximately five students per box) by
compacting successive layers of soil and placing bones within soil layers.
Exchange dig site boxes so each group is working on a different box than they
prepared. 
<p><img align=right src="Images/digit.gif" hspace=10>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Bones and/or pieces of bones (or you could use pieces of a puzzle)
<li>Pencil and paper
<li>Magnifying lens
<li>Small cardboard or wooden box (minimum of two feet long by two feet wide by
one foot deep)
<li>Small hand shovels
<li>Paint brushes
<li>Soil
<li>String
<li>Thumb tacks</ul>
<p>
1.  Prepare the boxes for the dig sites.<p>
2.  Attach string over the top of the box containing your group's dig site at
six inch intervals with thumb tacks to represent your coordinates.  Letter or
number string locations (see Figure A).   <p>
3.  Dig and brush carefully to locate and remove any "fossils."  Record the
locations of where you found the bones on a paper diagram that has the same
coordinates as your box.  You also should record the depth of the find.<p>
<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  How is the classroom dig similar to and different from a scientific dig?<p>
2.  Why are coordinates important to a dig site?<p>
3.  Why do you think fossils are more often found in sedimentary rock
formations?<p>

<li>Where do scientists find dinosaur bones?

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
The rocks where fossils are found can be soft and crumbly or very hard.  Often
both the rocks and the fossilized bones contain minerals that help protect the
bones from weathering.  Exposed bone, however, is sometimes very fragile.  To
prevent the bones from breaking, <A href="#paleontologist">paleontologists</A>,
the scientists who study
<A href="#dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>, use certain procedures to protect a fossil during its excavation and
shipment to the laboratory.  <p>
<p>
Once a specimen has been carefully exposed and examined for minerals, it is
prepared for removal.  First, the fossil is brushed with a type of glue or
plastic and then covered with strips of wet paper and burlap dipped in Plaster
of Paris for protection and support.  The most critical part of this
preparation is when the fossil has to be carefully turned over and the
underside is also covered and protected.  After the plaster sets, the fossil is
numbered and examined to determine what structural part of the animal has been
recovered. <p>

Back in the laboratory, each bone is cleaned and strengthened.  Knowledge of
today's animals' skeletons can help the scientists investigate the dinosaur's
remains.  By comparing features of bones, a paleontologist may be able to
identify the fossil and its function.  Bones along the back, from the skull or
in the jaw are very distinctive and often used to identify the fossil's
remains. <p>

Most or all of the skeleton can then be pieced together if enough bones have
been found.  Paleontologists may have to estimate the size and shape of missing
bones to complete a full skeleton.  Once all the pieces are identified, a model
of the animal is built to assist the scientist in rebuilding the entire
skeleton.  Then a large metal framework is welded together to support the
fossilized bones.  The bones are then free mounted to the framework.  If a
simpler mount is desired, scientists will fasten the fossils to a slab and use
a  bas-relief mounting.  Bas-relief mountings display the fossil as it was
buried.  Either method preserves the dinosaur's structure for further
observation and research.<hr>

<B>Build your Own Dinosaur!</B><p>
You can create the same kind of models scientists use in their study of
fossils!<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
Using similar techniques of mounting that paleontologists use, you will create
a scale model of your favorite dinosaur.  Make sure you know as much as you can
about the dinosaur you choose to assemble.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/dino3.gif" hspace=10>
Materials<ul>
<li>Various lengths of 3 cm and 6 cm-wide lumber
<li>Saw
<li>Hammer
<li>Nails
<li>Light wire or plastic mesh
<li>Newspaper
<li>Plaster of Paris
<li>Trowels
<li>Paint</ul>
<p>
1.  After gathering information and pictures, select your favorite dinosaur.<p>
2.  Begin building a framework for your dinosaur model out of the wood, hammer,
and nails.<p>
3.  Now cover your framework with mesh to begin creating the dinosaur's
structure.<p>
4.  Dip newspaper in the plaster of Paris and begin wrapping it around your
framework.  If you want to add details like feathers, scales or other features,
try carving them into the structure while the plaster is drying.<p>
5.  Once the plaster is completely dried, paint your dinosaur to make it look
as realistic as possible.<p>
6.  Start a "dinosaur zoo" for the class's models.<p>
<p>
<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  How does your model compare to the actual height, size and weight of a real
dinosaur?  Calculate ratios of your comparisons.<p>
2.  How did your procedure for assembling a dinosaur compare to the work of a
paleontologist?  What things did you do that was  your own idea?<p>
3.  What kind of environment did your dinosaur live in?  What did  it eat?
Find out who its enemies were.  You may want to build a diorama of its
environment as a place to put your model.<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
Create a dinosaur's world.  Investigate how their structure, function and
behavior were adapted to their environment.  Make a chart that highlights their
name, type, style of locomotion, choice of food, habitat and methods of
protection.  Does fossil evidence show what dinosaurs needed to survive?  What
are the theories about what may have happened to the dinosaurs?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
You can build a real animal skeleton.  Save the bones from a chicken dinner.
Carefully boil and bleach the bones and analyze which parts belong together.
Using a framework, begin rebuilding the chicken by gluing its bones together.
You may want to look at drawings of chickens and their skeletons to help you.

It is a dark and stormy night. A <A NAME="tyrannosaurus rex"><I>Tyrannosaurus rex</I></A>
wildly rips through an  electrified fence,then roars. The dinosaurs in the megahit 
movie <A NAME="Jurassic Park"><I>Jurassic Park</I></A>Jurassic Park  made
history as the most realistic-looking movie stars ever  created on a computer. Dozens 
of animators,artists, software programmers, and technicians collaborated on the 
project.<p>

They developed a galloping herd of ostrich-like <ANAME="Gallimimuses"><I>Gallimimuses</I></A>
entirely on computers.  But most dinosaur scenes blended footage of robotic models, 
puppets, and  cutting-edge computer graphics. For example, a full-body view of a 
computer-generated, gentle <ANAME="Brachiosaurus"><I>Brachiosaurus</I></A> switched seamlessly 
to a shot of a  hand-controlled, puppet dinosaur head.<p>

To bring the <A NAME="tyrannosaurus"><I>Tyrannosaurus</I></A> to life on a computer screen, animators first built a 3-D 
<A NAME="wire frame"><I>wire frame</I></A> skeleton on their
computers, based on photographs of dinosaur bones. But  how did a T-rex run and how fast could it go? To find out, the moviemakers consulted 
<A NAME="paleontologist"><I>paleontologists</I></A> and
examined fossilized footprints and other dinosaur remains. They  also observed wild animals, studying how giraffes eat and how elephants shift their 
weight as they walk.<p>

The animation team practiced pantomime so they could understand how to create more 
compelling performances from their dinosaur stars. To help, technicians invented the 
Dinosaur Input Device, a T-rex puppet connected to a computer. <A NAME="stop motion"><I>Stop-motion</I></A> 
animators--experts in animal movement--manipulated the robotic T-rex puppet with their 
skilled hands. Every time they moved it, the image on the computer screen moved too. 
When they opened the puppet's mouth to roar, the T-rex on the screen mirrored the 
movement, and the computer recorded it.<p>

The animators used a special <A NAME="scanner"><I>scanner</I></A> made
by Cyberware to capture the surface  dimensions for the computer-generated dinosaurs. The scanner moved a laser beam around  a sculpture model of the T-rex, capturing its form as a 3-D computer model.

One of the most difficult jobs was adding the skin. Computers are good at making shiny, 
smooth surfaces. But real animals are covered in varied wrinkles with shadows. The 
animators spent weeks determining how the skin of the T-rex should look as it
moved.<p>

Two years of painstaking work resulted in a total of six minutes of computer-generated 
dinosaur footage in the final film. The crew made great strides, improving computer 
animation technology and technique. Before long, expect to see computer-generated human 
actors appearing at a theater near you. Now, <A
NAME="that's"><I>that's</I></A> really frightening! <p>

<LI>The creators of Jurassic Park referred to dinosaurs model as "actors" and

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
To develop an understanding of how its dinosaurs could give expressive performances, 
the Jurassic Park computer animation team took lessons in pantomime. They hid their 
faces behind Balinese masks and tried to express a variety of emotions, using only 
their bodies. Try this technique in the following variation on the game
charades.<p>

<H3>Materials</H3>
<UL>
<LI> 8 index cards
<LI> two full-face masks (or 8 1/2" x 11" pieces of paper)</UL><p>

<ol>
<LI>  Set-up:  On the front of each index card, write down an emotion or
attitude. You  can use the words from the following list, or come up with your own. 
Leave the reverse side of each card blank.
<pre>aggressive
playful
bewildered
depressed
annoyed
excited
peaceful
nervous</pre><p>
Select one person to be the referee and give the referee the cards. Divide the 
remaining players into two teams, with two to ten players on each team. Each team 
should have the same number of players. Number the players on each team, from one on 
up.<p>
<LI>  Playing the game:  The referee picks a card from the stack and calls out
a   number corresponding to one of the player numbers. The players with that number 
on each team approach the referee. Both players get a chance to look at the card, 
then each takes a mask to cover her or his face. On a signal from the referee, the 
two players then return to their respective teams and begin acting out the attitude 
written on the card, using body language only (no symbols or sign language allowed).  
<LI>  Scoring: The first team to correctly guess each attitude scores a point.
A one-point penalty is subtracted if players acting out an attitude reveal
their faces. The game continues until one team scores five points or until the cards 
are used up.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="movie.gif">

<H3>Questions</H3>
<OL>
<LI>  Did you find it difficult to convey an attitude without using facial
  expressions? Which attitudes were hardest to convey? <p>
<LI>  Why do you think that the Jurassic Park computer animation team spent
 time behind masks and behaving like dinosaurs?<p></OL>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
The animators for Jurassic Park used both 2-D (flatbed) and 3-D scanners to capture 
images for the computer. Use a photocopier to scan your hand. What details of the 
hand does it capture? What does it miss? Do you recognize your own hand as 
distinguished from someone else's hand? If possible, compare the image of your 
hand to one captured using a computer flatbed scanner or a video camera attached 
to a computer. How might a 3-D scanner differ from these 2-D input devices?

<p>

The O.J. Simpson trial has generated much interest in <A HREF="#one">DNA</A>. Formerly used only in
research labs, DNA fingerprinting (called <A HREF="#two">DNA profiling</A> by scientists) has
entered an intense public spotlight, where lawyers, crime investigators, and
scientists constantly discuss its merits and pitfalls. Although usually used to
establish paternity, DNA profiling is such good evidence that prosecutors are
relying on it more and more to help convict suspects in criminal cases.<P>
A DNA molecule resembles a long, twisted ladder. The supports of the ladder are
the same for everyone, but the rungs are what make us all different. Each rung is
made of a pair of organic molecules called nitrogen bases-adenine, thymine,
cytosine, and guanine-usually symbolized as A, T, C, and G. The sequence of the
rungs is important. The bases constitute a code for different proteins, much like
the letters of an alphabet form words and sentences. Certain areas of the DNA
molecule have no currently understood function, but they appear to vary widely
among individuals. The most common form of DNA profiling, abbreviated RFLP, is a
way of showing the unique patterns of bases in some of these areas.<P>
Before the &quot;fingerprint&quot; analysis, the DNA must be sampled and stored
properly. Even blood or semen that has soaked into a rug or dried in the sunlight
can be a source for sample cells. An analysis can be done from as few as 100
cells but requires several steps:<BR>
<ol>
<li>Scientists extract DNA from the cells.<BR>
<li><A HREF="#five">Restriction enzyme</A>s cut the DNA into pieces of various sizes.<BR>
<li><A HREF="#three">Gel electrophoresis</A> separates pieces by size.<BR>
<li>Separated pieces are transferred to a nylon membrane, and some sequences are
labeled with a radioactive substance called a probe.<BR>
<li>X-ray film is exposed by the radioactive emissions of only the labeled
sequences. The developed film, called an autorad, shows the familiar track
pattern of a DNA profile.<P>
</ol>
To eliminate any possibility of a mistaken identity, analysts use several
different probes to look at several different DNA fragment patterns in a sample.
More than one person might have a particular RFLP pattern, but it becomes less
likely that multiple people will have two or more sequences in common.
Statisticians call this the <A HREF="#four">multiplication rule</A>, because the individual
probabilities of a mistaken identity for each pattern are multiplied together to
find the overall probability. <P>

<font size=+2>Connections</font><p>

1.  Should an individual have the right to refuse to give a blood sample for DNA
analysis, or should the authorities have the right to take such samples without
permission?<BR>
2.  Biotechnologists want to map the DNA of the entire human population. How
would this help us? What problems could it create?<P>

<BR>
<P>
You can separate different mixtures of chemicals by using chromatography, a
technique similar to the electrophoresis that scientists employ to separate DNA
fragments. These techniques depend on matching a standard mixture with the
unknown mixture and producing a visual representation of the components. A band
that appears at the same location for the sample and the standard is likely to be
the same substance.<P>
Materials<BR>
<ul>
<li>2 freezer storage boxes or other tall, square,
flat-bottomed containers with lids<BR> 
<li>filter paper, cut into rectangles just narrow enough to fit
into each storage box and about 1/2&quot; taller than the box (Coffee filters or other absorbent
paper may be substituted, but the resolution will not be as good.)<BR>
<li>water<BR>
<li>isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol<BR>
<li>toothpicks<BR>
<li>food coloring in a set of four different colors (preferably
the three primaries-red, blue, and yellow-and one
secondary color, such as green or purple, that is
a mixture of those primaries). The box should give the dye
names on the back, so the food colorings can serve as
standards.<BR>
<BR>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Pour about 1/4&quot; of rubbing alcohol into one freezer box and cover it.
Keep the lid on as much as possible, since the alcohol evaporates readily. Pour
about 1/4&quot; of water into the other freezer box and cover it.<BR>
<li>Use the toothpicks to make four spots of different food colorings evenly
across a piece of the filter paper, in a horizontal row about 1/2&quot; from the
bottom. Repeat on a second piece of the paper. Allow the spots to dry.<BR>
<li>Make a fold in the filter papers about 1/2&quot; from the top and place one
in each freezer box. The top fold should hook over the side of the box, and the
bottom 1/4&quot; of the paper should be dipped in the liquid. Cover the box. Do
not immerse the spots in the liquid.<BR>
<li>The alcohol and water will crawl up the papers, pulling the components of the
food coloring along. When the liquid reaches an inch from the top of the paper,
remove it and, with a pencil, mark how far the liquid traveled. Dry the papers.
Did the secondary color separate into two primary colors? Did similar colors
travel the same distance?  <P>
</ol>
Questions<BR>
1.  What other artificially colored food items could you analyze in this way?<BR>
2.  If someone used a black felt-tipped pen to scrawl graffiti on a building,
could you use chromatography to identify the ink? How would you design the
experiment? What might interfere with the analysis?<P>

You're hiking in the woods with a friend one evening when a wind kicks up and
rain starts to pour down. Suddenly you realize your friend isn't with you
anymore. You shout, but your voice gets lost in the storm. Taking out your
flashlight, you signal &quot;SOS&quot; in Morse Code. A few hundred feet away you
see your friend's flashlight signaling, &quot;I'm coming.&quot; <P>
Humans and animals both communicate in many ways. Humans use almost 6,000 spoken,
written, and code languages and also depend on <A HREF="#one">body language</A>, sight, touch, and
smell to relay messages. Animals communicate with many sounds, actions, and cues
as well. <P>
Dolphins, toothed whales, and porpoises depend on <A HREF="#five">vocalization</A>, <A HREF="#three">echolocation</A>, and
<A HREF="#four">ultrasound</A> to communicate with each other and navigate. With echolocation,
dolphins emit and process up to 700 clicking sounds per second to detect the size
and location of an object hundreds of meters away. Researchers at the Living Seas
exhibit at the Epcot&reg; Center in Orlando, Florida, found that dolphin
echolocation is sensitive enough to detect a three-inch steel ball from 100 yards
away.<P>
Another experiment at EPCOT Center involved a communications keyboard. Each key
on the keyboard had a word written on it, and each key had a related cubbyhole
containing an object that represented the word. Humans activated the keyboard by
touching a key. Dolphins activated it by inserting their beaks into one of the
cubbyholes. Inside each cubbyhole was an infrared beam. When that beam was broken
by a dolphin's beak, the human word was heard on an overhead speaker. Dolphins
used vision and echolocation to determine which cubbyhole to select when the
keyboard was activated.<P>
The dolphins seemed to expect certain behaviors from the trainers. When a human
touched the key, the dolphins would swim ahead, then turn to make sure their
trainer was following them to the right place.<P>
Scientists don't know if the dolphin's interaction with humans is sophisticated
communication or a <A HREF="#two">conditioned response</A> motivated by a reinforcer (food). It may
be a long time, if ever, before we can speak &quot;dolphin&quot; and find out
what's on their minds.<P>

<BR>
<P>

Many animal communication systems depend on matching scents or sounds to identify
friends and enemies. Explore what it would be like to use your nose to find out
who your friends and enemies are.<P>
Materials<BR>
<ul>
<li>1 plastic film canister or similar small container per
person <BR>
<li>poster board	<BR>
<li>yarn or string<BR>
<li>scissors<BR>
<li>cotton balls<BR>
<li>spoons<BR>
<li>a variety of strongly scented materials, such as vanilla
flavoring, peppermint flavoring, pine-scented room freshener,
lemon-scented cleaning liquid, cedar chips,
freshly chopped or pressed garlic, vinegar, oregano, cloves, bubble
gum, peanut butter, and cinnamon<BR>
 <BR>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Make a scent bracelet for each participant by poking two holes opposite each
other about 1 cm (3/8&quot;) from the top of each film canister. Cut a 25-cm
(10&quot;) length of string or yarn to pull through the holes. Tie a knot in the
yarn to complete the bracelet. <BR>
<li>Poke several holes in the canister lids to allow the scent to escape. <BR>
<li>Place the same scent in pairs of canisters to create matching sets of
scent-filled canister bracelets. For the liquid scents, such as vanilla or
peppermint flavoring, pour a small amount of liquid onto a cotton ball and place
it in the canister. Cover each canister with a lid to hide the contents.<BR>
<li>Distribute the bracelet sets at random to the participants.  <BR>
<li>Instruct the participants that they may use only their noses to find the
other person with the same scent. No words, sounds, or gestures are allowed. When
they find their friend, they should report to you.<BR>
<li>Record on a poster board which pairs were easiest or hardest to find. <BR>
<li>Repeat the exercise, but be sure that each participant has a different scent.
</ol>
<P>
Questions<BR>
1.  What factors could have affected the discovery process?<BR>
2.  Is it easier for the new pairs to locate each other after learning to use
their noses in the first session? Why is that the case?<P>

Cut out pictures of faces that show different expressions. Mount each on a
separate piece of poster board. Ask several friends, one at a time, to look at
each and tell you what emotion they see. Record each person's answers. How do the
answers compare? Did everyone see the same thing in each picture?<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>

Use a dictionary of American Sign Language (ASL) to learn to communicate a short
story. Ask a friend who doesn't know any ASL to watch you tell the story. Ask
that person to write down what your story is about. Then teach your friend what
you learned about ASL and try telling the story again. Did your friend understand
it better?<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>

Humans speak almost 6,000 different languages. Make a list of 10 important words
or phrases and find out how to say them in five other languages. If you have
friends who speak other languages, ask them (or their parents or grandparents)
for help in pronouncing the words correctly.<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>

The same sound produces different echoes in different locations. Try making the
same set of noises (a whisper, a loud shout) in different places. You might try
standing in a large room with a high ceiling, a bathtub or shower, outside next
to a building, outside in the middle of a field, and in a car. What does the
sound tell you about the environment?<P>

<hr><center><B>Discussion</B></center><p> If you have ever bounced around on a
"moon jump" at the fair or slept on an air mattress, then you know that fabric
filled with air can support hundreds of kilograms of weight.  This same principle
is used at the Hubert H. Humphrey Stadium, also called the Metrodome, in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. <p> The stadium is an air-supported structure.  The
structure is covered with 10 acres of <A href="#teflon">teflon</A>-coated
fabric.  This flame-retardant coating on the outside is strong enough to protect
the
fabric from <A href="#ultra">ultraviolet radiation</A> from the Sun, air
pollution, acid rain and other sources of physical damage. <p> The stadium has 20
electric
air fans to maintain a positive air pressure inside the structure, although only
three usually operate at one time.  A computerized <A href="#pneumatic
">peumatic</A> system continually monitors the air pressure and engages extra
100-horsepower
fans when the air pressure drops.  These fans can blow air into the structure at
about 100,000 cubic feet per minute.  While positive air pressure keeps the
Metrodome up, 26 cables are connected to the fabric to keep the entire structure
in place. <p> Full-sized, air-supported sports stadiums are no longer being built
in the United States.  Too many problems with wet snow conditions and inadequate
heating systems have had architects reconsider the design of large
fabric-enclosed structures.  Cable-supported or <A href="#tensile
">tensile</A> structures are currently the preferred design for stadiums. <p> But
designers
have found other extremely practical uses for air-supported structures.  They are
used for temporary buildings and small sports facilities.  The most exciting
design is for hazardous waste clean-up sites.  The air-supported covers prevent
the sites from emitting toxic material into the environment. <p>

<p>

Picture it. You're sitting on the sofa watching another fun-packed episode of Newton's 
Apple when out of nowhere, you hear a dull roar. The room starts to shake, pictures 
fall off the wall, and for a few seconds it seems you've lost your sense of balance. 
Suddenly, all is quiet. Was it an explosion? Did a truck crash into your house? 
Finally, the announcement comes over the television--you have just survived an 
earthquake.<p>

Could this really happen to you? If you live in California, it happens fairly often. 
But what if you live in places like North Dakota, Florida, or New York? Are you safe?
<p>
Well, don't get too comfortable. Earthquakes can happen in many places, although they 
are concentrated in certain areas. 
<p>
An earthquake occurs when two parts of Earth's <I><A NAME="litho">lithosphere</A></I> slide past, away from, or 
into each other. According to current theory, Earth's surface is made up of many large 
slabs of crust called plates, which ride like giant rafts on semifluid rock below. 
Geologists believe that the plates are driven by large <I><A NAME="convection">convection currents</A></I> created by 
heat generated deep within Earth by the radioactive decay of certain elements. While 
most earthquakes happen at plate boundaries, some occur in the middle of a plate. 
<p>
Just as the continents have moved, plate boundaries have also changed. Over the years, 
Earth's lithosphere has been split up and put together many times, leaving millions of 
scars or <I><A NAME="fault">faults</A></I>. Many of these old faults are static, but every so often stresses build 
up because of rock movement in the <I><A NAME="mantle">mantle</A></I>, causing a fault to rupture and an earthquake 
to occur.<p>

Today, geologists use two different scales to measure how strong an earthquake is. The 
Richter scale measures the actual size (or amplitude) of the wave generated by a 
particular earthquake on a <I><A NAME="seis">seismograph</A></I>. This is an indirect measure of the amount of 
energy released by the earthquake. A one-point increase on the Richter scale equals a 
tenfold amplitude of wave increase, which equals approximately 32 times more earthquake 
energy. 
<p>
A second type of scale, the modified Mercalli intensity scale, measures the amount and 
type of damage that earthquakes do to buildings and other structures, and their effects 
on humans. Because of these differences in measurements, an earthquake with a low 
Richter magnitude reading that occurs in a densely populated area like Los Angeles can 
actually have a higher Mercalli value or intensity than a high-magnitude quake in a 
desolate region like Antarctica.<p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think would happen to your community if it were hit by a
Richter magnitude- 8 earthquake? 
<li>What structures would be damaged?

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
One of the main causes of damage in an earthquake is the collapse of buildings not 
strong enough to withstand the shaking. Engineers and architects try to design buildings
rigid enough to withstand the shock, but flexible enough to give a little under the 
stress. By building and testing different models, they can "shake down" their ideas and 
see which one "stands" the test of time.

<h3>Materials</h3>
<uL>
<li>  40 coffee stirrers or cocktail straws
<li>  40 mini marshmallows  
<li>  a metric ruler   
<li>  2 shallow cardboard boxes (the trays used for cases of soda cans work well)  
<li>  a pair of scissors  
<li>  10-20 marbles  
<li>  4 short rubber bands  
<li>  stapler</ul><p>
<ol>
<li>  Before building your models, you must first build a shake tray. Place one cardboard 
box on a table and, with the scissors, cut the bottom out of the second box so that it 
fits inside the first box with a 2-cm clearance around each side. Place the marbles in 
the first box and rest the cut piece of cardboard on top of them. Use the stapler to 
attach one rubber band to each inside corners of the first box and then to the corners 
of the cardboard insert. The rubber bands should be taut, but not overstretched. To 
start the tray shaking, pull the insert toward one side of the box and let it go.
<li>  Using the marshmallows and straws (or stirrers) as building elements, assemble a 
structure that measures at least 50 cm high.
<li>  Place the structure on the middle of the shake tray and see how it stands up to 
your quake. Try building several different designs to see if one particular shape 
stands up better than the rest.
<li>  Hold a design competition with your friends. See who can build an earthquake-proof 
structure using the least amount of material.
<li>  Try varying the amount of time and the strength of the shaking by how hard you 
pull on the insert and how tight you stretch the rubber bands.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="earthquake.gif"><p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<OL>
<li>  What structural shapes seem to survive quakes best? Can you think of any
existing  buildings that use this type of design?
<li>  What type of earthquake motion was your shake tray simulating? Are there other 
motions in a quake? How might you duplicate them?
<li>  Do you think that it is possible to build an earthquake-proof structure? Why or why 
not?
<li>  How does the amount of shaking time affect building damage?
<li> How does the strength of the shaking affect building damage?</ol><hr>

Make a plate tectonic model of Earth by tracing the present-day outlines of continents 
from a map onto a piece of heavy construction paper. Cut out the different land masses 
and see if you can put them back together again. If you try really hard, you might be 
able to reunite Gondwanaland.<hr>

 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Reading or hearing about the results of a public opinion poll has become a
common everyday experience for many.  Everyone from political candidates to toy
manufacturers seems to be trying to find out what people are thinking by
polling the general population.  The question is, can any of these surveys be
trusted?<p>
While many people don't think of surveys as being scientific, the
implementation and interpretation of surveys belongs to a branch of mathematics
called <a href="#four">statistics</a>.  Professional statisticians use very strict rules in
designing and evaluating these surveys, much like a physicist uses specific
techniques to collect data from an experiment.<p>
The two most important aspects of conducting an accurate survey involve <a href="#two">random
sampling</a> and bias.  Random sampling is a technique used to ensure that each
member of a specific target population has an equal chance of being selected.
There are a number of ways to get a random sample.  A simple method would be to
put into a hat many pieces of paper on which are written the names of the
people in the target population.  From this sampling, a certain number of names
are literally "pulled out of a hat."  This is the same technique used in
lottery drawings in which numbered balls are randomly selected.  The drawback
is obvious:  If the population is large, the mechanics of taking the sample
become unwieldy.  Today, computers can be used to generate a table of random
numbers -- an electronic version of "shaking up the balls."<p>
The second important factor in surveys is bias, which can creep into the
selection process of the person who is to answer the questions, or into the
design of the questions that are to be asked.  <a href="#three">Selection bias</a> usually occurs
when a part of the target population is inadvertently excluded.  One example
would be selecting individuals from a town by drivers' licenses.  Since some
people don't drive, they would be automatically excluded from the target
population.
<p>
Bias also becomes a factor by the way in which the questions are written and
presented.  The wording of the questions and the choices of the answers must be
structured so that all questions and answers are of equal value.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4><p>
1.  What is the relationship between the size of a sample and the margin of
error in a survey?  Why does increasing the sample size give better results? <br>
2.  Most political opinion polls are conducted through telephone surveys of
likely voters.  Discuss if this kind of selection results in a biased survey.
What criteria would you use to select individuals from your town for a survey
that didn't have any selection bias?

<h1>Poll Position</h1>
Learn the ins and outs of being a pollster.<br>
</center>
<p>
You will discover how bias in questioning affects the outcome of a poll.  By
asking two sets of questions, you might get two different conclusions.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>pencil <br>
<li>plain paper<br>
<li>graph paper<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Prepare two questionnaires that will poll your schoolmates about their
favorite foods to have in the school lunchroom.  Design one set of questions
with a minimal amount of bias (e.g., "On Mondays, which would you rather have:
pizza, hamburgers, or fried chicken?").  Design the second set of questions so
that they place substantial bias (e.g., "Wouldn't you rather have pizza for
lunch instead of a boring hamburger?").<p>
<li>Select one grade level to be polled and get permission to poll two
classrooms, one with the bias survey and the other with the unbiased one.
Conduct the polling so that the two groups of students don't know that they are
getting separate questionnaires.<p>
<li>Compile the results of the two polls and graph the results.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  How did the results of the two surveys differ?  In which survey were the
answers more predictable?<p>
2.  What elements of bias may have entered into the selection of the students
in this survey?<p>
3.  When professional research firms conduct surveys, they often ask for the
same information two or three times, each time worded differently, during the
course of the survey.  Why might they do this?<p>
Gather together a number of survey questions from magazines and journals.
Analyze each of the questions for bias.  Try rewriting the questions so that
they have little or no bias in them.

Put yourself in the position of a corporate market-research specialist.  Your
company has just come up with a new fast-food idea but before you spend
millions of dollars promoting it, you want to get some idea as to whether or
not people are going to eat it.  Develop a market research poll that not only
describes the product, but targets specific parts of the population.

Recently, there has been a debate on whether news organizations should release
the results of election exit polls from the East Coast of the United States
while residents of the West Coast have yet to vote.  Some people say this
influences the election outcome, while others say there is no harm.  What's
your opinion?

<h1>Electric Cars</h1>
How can a car run on electricity alone?
<hr>
</center>
Peggy goes around in circles trying to find out what fuels an electric car.<br>
Segment length:  5:50
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Electric cars offer many advantages when compared to gasoline-powered cars.
Electric cars run without burning gasoline, and therefore, produce no exhaust
pollution.  They are relatively quiet during normal operation and nearly silent
when idling; therefore, they produce much less noise pollution than
gasoline-powered cars.  <p>
Electric cars don't have many of the parts that gasoline-powered cars do -- parts
that need continual upkeep at best, and that often fail (e.g., fuel injectors,
carburetors, mufflers, distributors, water pumps, etc.).  There are no tune-ups
or oil changes for electric cars.  Required <a href="#one">battery</a> maintenance is minimal.
There is no emission-control system, which is one of the most complex and
expensive parts of a car that uses gasoline.  Most of the components in an
electric car are electrical or solid-state, with no moving parts.  The overall
costs for maintaining an electric car average about 30% of that for gas-powered
cars.  <p>
So, if electric vehicles are so great, why don't we see many around?  There are
several reasons for this, the primary one being the relative efficiency of
gasoline as a fuel.  Gasoline is fairly inexpensive to produce; because it's a
liquid, it's cheap to store and transport; and it has a very high energy
content per unit of weight.  Batteries, by comparison, have a low energy
content per unit of weight.  Several hundred pounds of batteries are needed for
some electric cars.  These batteries store as much energy as a single gallon of
gasoline, which weighs only about five or six pounds.  In addition, an electric
vehicle gets only about 100 miles to a charge and can take hours to fully
<a href="#five">recharge</a>.<p>
There are developments in electric cars that might eliminate some of the
disadvantages.  One example was seen in the Newton's Apple segment.  This style
of car is fueled by electrical metal strips laid within the roadbed.
Electrical energy is provided from a central source through the metal strip.
These electric cars do not require a battery source, only an <a 
href="#three">electric motor</a>. <p>
The electric-vehicle industry continues to grow.  By the year 2000, any
manufacturer who wants to sell gas-powered cars in the state of California must
also have electric cars available.  The cost of an electric car is
approximately $17,000.  Many "do-it-yourselfers" are converting their
gas-powered cars to electric cars, thus saving money. <p>
Our dependence on the internal combustion engine is costing us in many ways,
including monetarily and environmentally.  Electric vehicles can bring us
cleaner air and greater energy independence.
<p>

<h1>Making The Connection</h1></a><br>
Investigate how different materials can produce electrical energy.
</center>
<p>
Test different substances to determine whether they can produce an electrical
current.
<p>
<ul>Part I</ul>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>#6 dry cell<br>
<li>knife switch OR push button<br>
<li>compass<br>
<li>15 feet of 28-gauge (or finer) insulated wire
</ul>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Wind the insulated wire about 10 times around the compass at the north- and
south-pole markings.  The compass should be rotated so that the compass needle
is also aligned in a north-south direction.<p>
<li>Connect the wires in a complete circuit.<p>
<li>Use the knife switch or push button to close the circuit only for a moment
at a time.<p>
 CAUTION:  Leaving the circuit closed will result in a short circuit with the
wires becoming very hot!<p>
<li>Now make your own batteries using household items and test them in the next
investigation.  Use the "compass" galvanometer to detect an electric current
after constructing it in steps 1 through 4.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  What happened to the compass needle when the circuit was closed?<p>
2.  How do you know that the deflection of the compass indicates a current
flow?  Try showing that a straight wire can also cause the compass to deflect
when near a current-carrying wire.
<p>
<ul>Part II</ul>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>lemon<br>
<li>vinegar<br>
<li>orange juice<br>
<li>wire from Part I<br>
<li>compass from Part I<br>
<li>copper strip approximately 3/4" wide and 5" long<br>
<li>zinc strip approximately 3/4" wide and 5" long<br>
<li>wide-mouth glass jar
</ul>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Carefully squeeze or roll on a hard surface the unpeeled lemon until it
feels very soft.  Be careful not to break or puncture the skin.  Push the
copper and zinc strips into the lemon.<p>
<li>Wrap the ends of the wires from the compass galvanometer around the metal
strips as illustrated.  What happened to the compass needle when the circuit
was closed?  Was the compass needle deflected?  What does that indicate?<p>
<li>Now repeat the procedure using a jar of vinegar and then a jar of orange
juice.  Be sure to wash the metal strips with water before testing a new
substance.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  What would happen if you used a non-conducting liquid, such as milk?  What
needs to be present to cause a current to flow?<p>
2.  Look at and identify the parts of a battery.  What components in your
circuit correspond to these parts?<p>

<i>How Can the Sun Help Power a Car?</i></center><p><hr>

Peggy learns how a solar car is made and follows the General Motors Solar Car Sunrayce.<p>
<ul>
<li>What are the benefits and drawbacks of solar powered cars?  
<li>Would people save money and energy if more were on the road?  
<li>Would you want to take a trip across the country in one?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
<A href="#solar">Solar</a> power comes from the energy of our Sun, a yellow dwarf star located 93 million miles from the Earth.  It is a 
middle-aged, mid-size star compared to the billions of other stars in the universe.<p>

The interior of the Sun is a region very high in temperature and filled with dense gases.  The Sun's core is estimated 
to be approximately 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.  Heat and light from the Sun are produced through a process called 
<A href="#nuclf">nuclear fusion</a>.<p>

Sunlight is an excellent energy source and the future of using solar power is very exciting.  The Sun's energy can be 
used to heat and cool buildings, generate electricity, operate communication and navigation systems and even power 
solar cars, like the ones in the General Motors Solar Car Sunrayce featured in the Newton's Apple segment!<p>

Solar-powered cars all get their fuel from the same place - the Sun.  The cars use hundreds of photovoltaic cells to 
convert sunlight into electricity.  Each cell produces about one-half volt of electricity.<p>  

When the Sunrayce teams design their electrical systems they have to allow for variations in sunlight.  The Sun's 
energy powers the car's motor and charges a battery for use when the Sun is hidden by a cloud.  If a car is designed 
to put all of its energy toward driving and keeps nothing in reserve, it will stop completely in cloudy weather.  If 
too much energy is diverted to the battery, the engine runs too slowly to keep up in the race.<p>  

Engineers and scientists still have many questions and problems to tackle before solar power becomes an efficient and 
economical way to fuel vehicles.  But as the demand on <A href="#fossfu">fossil fuel</a> resources increases, research will continue to 
search for alternative energy sources, including harnessing the Sun's energy to drive a vehicle.  The most exciting 
part of using solar power as an energy source is that it is pollution free and inexhaustible.  If research continues, 
one day solar energy may replace today's combustion engine cars!<p>

Investigate other uses of solar power.  Contact your local utility company and ask them about solar heating and cooling
systems. Compare the costs of using solar power to natural gas and electricity.  Prepare an annual budget and see which
energy source is the most economical.<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Discover how light and heat can be used as energy.  Try filling one pie pan half full with white sand and another half 
full with dark soil.  Insert a thermometer in each pan with the bulb just below the surface.  Record the temperatures 
for both pans.  Place pans at an equal distance under a lamp with a 150-watt light bulb.  Turn the light on and wait 
for five minutes.  Test the temperature in both pans and record your findings.  Are the pans the same temperature?  
What would happen if the pans were further away from the light?  How could scientists use this energy?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

A radiometer is an instrument that measures radiant energy.  See if your school has one you can use to study light.  
What happens if it is put in front of a light source?  If you block the light with your hand, what happens?  What kind 
of energy do the moving vanes have?  Why are the vanes black and white?  What powers the radiometer?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Color can change the amount of light and heat that are absorbed. Find out which colors are the most receptive.  Paint a
few tin cans different colors.  Make sure you use matt paints or ones that aren't too shiny.  Fill each can with equal 
amounts of water.  Using a thermometer, record the temperature in each can.  Allow them to sit in the sun for a few 
minutes.  Test the temperatures in the cans and then arrange them in a rainbow from coolest to hottest.  Now that you 
know which colors are coolest, what colors will you wear in the summer from now on?  What about the winter?  What color
would you pick to paint your house to save energy?<p><p>

David conducts a study of electrical circuits.
Segment length: 9:01

When it comes to understanding electricity, to get to the heart of the matter you must 
literally get to the heart of matter--the atom. Atoms are the building blocks of matter 
and they are composed of three particle types. The central core of the atom is called 
the nucleus and it contains positively charged particles called protons and neutral 
particles called neutrons. The movement of many charged particles in the same direction 
is called an electric <I><A NAME="current">current</A></I>.<p>

Charged particles flow most easily through <I><A NAME="conductor">conductors</A></I>, such as metals, or through some 
liquids, such as salt water. Electrons in metals are loosely attached to the atoms, so 
they can move easily. The human body (which is mostly salt water) is also a good 
conductor, which is why electric shocks can be so dangerous. <I><A NAME="insulator">Insulators</A></I>, on the other 
hand, do not conduct electricity well. Their electrons are tightly bound to their atoms 
and do not move easily. Typical insulators include rubber, wood, glass, and most 
plastics.
<p>
Electricity will only flow when a power source, such as a battery or a <I><A NAME="gener">generator</A></I>, sets 
the electrons in motion and when the electrons can complete a full circle. Consider 
this example--electrons flow from a battery down a wire to a light bulb, through the 
filament of the bulb, and then back up another wire to the battery. This closed loop 
is called a <I><A NAME="circ">circuit</A></I>. No electrical device, whether it's a
simple flashlight or a  complex computer, will work unless the circuit that delivers the electric current is a 
complete loop.
<p>
Electricity becomes dangerous to you when you become part of the electrical loop--when 
the electrons have enough energy and make adequate contact to pass through your body. 
You can touch both ends of a flashlight battery and feel nothing, but if you're wet and 
in contact with household electricity, water can make a very good path through your 
skin and your body, making you part of the electrical circuit!
<p>
Electrical energy always seeks the shortest route around the circuit back to the source,
which in the above example is the battery. If the wires both touch a conductor, such as 
a metal tabletop, the electrons will take that shorter route back to the battery, 
rather than travel to the light bulb. (Conveniently, scientists call this a "short 
circuit.")<p>

So why don't birds get electrocuted when they sit on power lines? The power lines that 
are suspended in pairs between power poles are analogous to the wires that run between 
the battery and the light bulb. As long as birds sit on only one, they offer no 
"shortcut" to complete the circuit. But if their wings accidently touch both adjacent 
power lines, the electrons take a new path and complete the circuit through the 
unfortunate bird's body! <br>
<ul>
<li>Imagine a world without electrical power. How would you cook, clean, and
entertain  yourself? 
<li>Even though electrical energy is useful, its production often causes
environmental  problems. Acid precipitation from burning coal and disposal of nuclear waste are just 
two of them. What are some alternative power sources and how can conservation help 
minimize the damage?</ul><hr>

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
Which common objects are insulators and which are conductors? To test it for yourself, 
you can build a simple, battery-powered conductivity tester.<p>

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
<li>  flashlight with one fresh D cell
<li>  3 pieces of insulated wire, each approximately 15 cm (6") long with the ends stripped
<li>  roll of masking or duct tape
<li>  penny
<li> comb
<li>  several pieces of fabric
<li> metal fork or spoon
<li>  several different rocks
<li>  various objects for testing</ul><p>
<ol>
<li>  To build your tester, unscrew the top of the flashlight which has the bulb assembly 
in it. Take one wire and tape it to the metal tip of the light bulb and tape a second 
wire to the metal ring that touches the side of the bulb.
<li>  Tape the other end of the wire connected to the tip of the light bulb to the (+) 
end of a D cell and touch the free end of the second wire to the (-) end of the cell. 
The light should go on because you have completed a circuit. If it doesn't, make sure 
all the connections are taped tightly and make good contact.
<li>  Tape one end of the third wire to the (-) end of the cell and touch its free end to 
the free end of the wire coming from the bulb holder. Again, the light should go on. 
Try touching the two free ends of the wires to the penny at the same time. The bulb 
should light because the penny is made of copper, a good conductor.
<li>  Collect your objects to be tested and predict if they are insulators or conductors. 
Then try them out with your tester.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="birdwire.gif"><p>

<h3>Questions</h3><ol>
<li>  In general, what types of materials make the best conductors?
<li>  Look inside the body of the flashlight. How does the switch control make
the light  go on and off?</ol><hr>
<A NAME="try this"></A>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Build an electromagnet using a D cell, a large steel nail, and about 50 cm (20") of 
insulated wire. Strip the insulation off two ends of the wire and carefully wrap the 
wire around the nail to form tight coils. Don't overlap the coils and make sure that 
you leave at least 6 cm (2.4") of wire free at each end. Connect the two ends of the 
wire to the two ends of the D cell and bring the tip of the nail very near some metal 
paper clips. The magnet will only attract if the circuit is complete.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Examine your family's electric bill. What is a kilowatt? How much does the electric 
company charge for one kilowatt hour? Is that a constant rate? Make a list of the 
appliances that you think use the most electricity. Contact the electric company to see 
if you are correct. Does your family use the same amount of electricity each month? Why 
or why not?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Static electricity can do more than make your socks stick together. You can use it to 
light a fluorescent tube. Get a small fluorescent bulb and a balloon. In a darkened 
room, rub the balloon on your hair a few times. Bring the charged balloon near one end 
of the bulb and you should see some light flashes.<hr>

<p>
Medical personnel call it <A HREF="#trauma"><i>trauma</i></A>. Lay people call it injury. Regardless of the
term used, it represents the leading cause of death for people under the age of
44.
<P>
Every six minutes, an American dies from an injury. Automobile accidents are the
leading cause, with alcohol a frequent contributing factor. Other major causes
include guns, fire, falls, and drowning.
<P>
The medical response to trauma often begins with a call to 911, the emergency
response phone system. When a caller reports an accident to 911 dispatchers,
specially trained <A HREF="#paramedics"><i>paramedics</i></A> or mobile emergency medical technicians (EMTs) rush
to the scene of the injury.
<P>
Paramedics stabilize and transport the victim to the hospital as quickly and
safely as possible. Because the brain cannot be deprived of oxygen or blood flow
for even a couple minutes, the EMT first attends to the ABCs (airway, breathing,
and circulation). Blood, secretions, false teeth, food, vomit, or other
obstructions in the victim's airway must be cleared first. If the patient is not
breathing adequately, technicians perform artificial respiration. They then check
pulse and blood pressure to see if circulation is adequate. Because many trauma
victims suffer blood loss, technicians usually put an intravenous (IV) line into
the patient's vein and infuse it with a solution of salt water to help prevent
shock.
<P>
To avoid additional injury on the way to the hospital, paramedics splint or
immobilize broken or potentially broken bones. Victims who remain alert can help
them by telling them if something hurts. The unconscious victim--who likely has
suffered a head injury--requires special care so the neck and spine are protected
from irreversible injury.
<P>
In regions well prepared to handle accident victims, the police, paramedics, and
hospital personnel work in close cooperation. Often a helicopter speeds the
victim to the <A HREF="#center"><i>trauma center</i>.</A>
<P>
At the hospital, a trauma team of <A HREF="#emergency"><i>emergency medicine</i></A> physicians,
anesthesiologists, surgeons, and nurses takes over. They evaluate the patient, do
another check of the ABCs, and then proceed with the necessary diagnostic and
treatment measures.
<P>
Studies show that with good trauma systems in place, a city's trauma death rate
tends to drop dramatically.

David dispels some misconceptions about life at the African equator.<BR>
Segment length: 6:00<P>


<p>
<img align=Middle hspace=0 src="../stills/apples.gif" width=30 height=37 alt="*">
<a name="1"><font size=+2>Insights</font></a>
<p><BR>

Run your finger along the <A HREF="#44">equator</A> on a globe. What do you see in your mind's eye
as your finger passes over continents and oceans? Tropical rain forests? Houses
on stilts? Blazing temperatures? Stop your finger on the east African country of
Kenya and be prepared for new impressions. Lying on the equator in the
southwestern corner of Kenya is the <A HREF="#9">Maasai Mara National Reserve</A> - a nature
preserve that defies the usual image of the equatorial tropics.<P>
This reserve is a part of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. Here you will find not
rain forests, but woodlands and <A HREF="#7">savanna</A>. Two million years ago, volcanic and
<A HREF="#8">tectonic activity</A> pushed up the lush forest floors of this region, creating a
plateau 1,520 meters (5,000 feet) above sea level. At this elevation, the warm
ocean winds were cut off, forests disappeared, and volcanic ash settled over the
highlands, creating the rolling plains of today. Temperatures can reach 38 C
(100 F) and cool to 10 C (50 F).<P>
Dramatic volcanic action also produced Mount Kenya. Once higher than Mount
Everest, Mount Kenya now stands 5,200 meters (17,000 feet) high and is crowned
with snow. Snow! On the equator? <P>
Why doesn't the snow melt? First, as one ascends from sea level, the temperature
decreases. In fact, according to the <A HREF="#11">adiabatic lapse rate</A>, for every thousand
feet, the temperature drops approximately 3.1 C (5.5 F). Second, the shiny
surface of the snow reflects the sun's rays, keeping the snow frozen. (This
effect is called the <A HREF="#22">albedo</A>.) Third, the snow is so densely packed at the peak
that the lower layers of snow cool the surface layer, counteracting the warming
effects of the sun.<P>
Life in the shadow of Mount Kenya may defy our equatorial image, too. For a
thousand years, the nomadic <A HREF="#55">Maasai</A> have shared their home with wildebeest, lion,
and giraffe. More precious to the Maasai are the herds of cattle upon which their
livelihood, wealth, and prestige depend. The Maasai villages are built with the
materials at hand-mud, cow dung, and sticks. Women are responsible for the
construction of the family <A HREF="#33">boma</A>. Life in the <A HREF="#6">manyatta</A> follows traditional
patterns, and the roles of its members are clearly defined. Boys take care of the
cattle, girls help their mothers, and elders enjoy their honored roles as village
leaders. Although life in nearby cities offers modern conveniences, many Maasai
prefer the path of their ancestors under the direct rays of the equatorial
sun.<P>

latitude to find out how far north you are from the equator.<P>

<b>Materials</b><BR>
<ul>
<li>one 15 cm x 15 cm (6&quot; x 6&quot;) piece of poster board
 <BR>
<li>one plastic drinking straw<BR>
<li>small weight such as metal sinker or washer<BR>
<li>paper clip<BR>
<li>transparent tape<BR>
<li>protractor<BR>
<li>pencil <BR>
<li>scissors<P>
</ul>
<img align=right hspace-5 src="illustrations/Equatr.gif">
1.  Draw two lines, each 1.25 cm (1/2&quot;) from the edge of the poster board,
so that the lines make a right angle at the corner of the board. <BR>
2.  With your protractor as a guide, draw an arc between the two lines.<BR>
3.  Using the protractor, mark off every five degrees from 0 to 90 and label each
mark. Trim off the extra poster board along the arc.<BR>
4.  Make a hole at the right angle as shown and thread the piece of string
through it. At one end, tie a paper clip so that the string doesn't slip through
the hole. Tie the weight to the other end so that it hangs straight down.<BR>
5.  Tape the straw to the edge of the poster board closest to the 90 degree mark.<BR>
6.  On a clear night, go outside and find the constellation Ursa Major (also
known as the Big Dipper). Using your sextant, sight the North Star through the
straw. Notice you are actually measuring the angle from the horizon to the North
Star. Write down the degree of the angle as marked by the string on the sextant.
This shows your latitude from the equator. Check your answer using a map or
globe.<P>


<b>Questions</b><BR><p>
1.  One degree latitude is approximately 110 km (69 miles). How far are you from
the equator? <BR>
2.  Why is it possible to calculate the latitude by sighting the North Star?<P>

The shiny surface of the snow on Mount Kenya reflects light, keeping the snow
from melting. Try this activity to see why. Take two identical glass jars and
fill them with equal amounts of water at the same temper-ature. Cover one jar
with a piece of foil. Cover the other with a sheet of black paper. Place the jars
outside on a sunny day. After an hour, measure the water temperature of each jar.
Which one is cooler? Why?<P>

Want to find north without a compass? Pound a stick into the ground at an angle
so that it is pointing directly toward the sun and not casting a shadow. Wait
about an hour until the stick casts a shadow about 15 cm (6&quot;) long. The
shadow will be pointing east from the stick. Why? Stand with your right shoulder
pointing in the direction of the shadow, and you will be facing north. Now, which
direction is the equator?<P>

Have you ever wondered how astronauts brush
their teeth in space? You don't see any sinks in spacecraft, do you? And in zero
gravity, how can they rinse and spit out after brushing?<p>Astronauts can brush
in space thanks to a very clever invention. They use a foamless toothpaste that
doesn't need water, has a pleasant taste, and is perfectly safe to swallow.<P>
Edible toothpaste is just one example of <A HREF="#33">ergonomics</A> at work. Ergonomics is a term
taken from the Greek word "ergon", meaning work, and "nomos";
meaning natural laws. In other words, ergonomics refers to the natural laws of
work. It's the science of designing the job, products, and place to fit the
worker. <p>Ergonomics enters into the design of everything from equipment for
space missions to the most comfortable car interior or athletic shoes. The idea
behind it is simple. If you use a tool to do something it wasn't designed to do,
then the tool can be damaged. In the same way, if you perform tasks beyond your
physical capabilities,  then you can get &quot;damaged,&quot; too. <p>Many
work-related injuries develop gradually over time. Called cumulative trauma
disorders (CTDs), or repetitive motion disorders, they can be caused by repeated,
constant, or excessive stress on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and nerves.
If your job requires you to continually bend, lift, or stretch, you could end up
with a back sprain. If you need to constantly bend, twist, or make repetitive
motions with your hands and wrists, such as typing on a keyboard, you might
acquire <A HREF="#22">carpal tunnel syndrome</A>. <p>To prevent injuries, ergonomists first
determine the needs and capabilities of the people who will use a work site or
product. (These are called the <A HREF="#44">human factors</A>.) To do this, they conduct many
tests to find out the typical body size and common physical tendencies of the
workers, such as muscle movement and vision. They use instruments like
<A HREF="#11">anthropometers</A> and <A HREF="#55">sliding caliper</A>s to measure the human body, as well as
workplace surveys to collect data. They also have volunteers test products and
they conduct workplace simulations to watch how people do their jobs.<p>Based on
this research, ergonomists design work areas, products, and equipment to fit the
needs of workers. Because of them, people can work more safely, comfortably, and
efficiently.

Create a comfortable environment for three-headed, scaly, thirsty
Zorbagians.
</center>
<BR>
<P><BR> <p>
Congratulations! You're a famous ergonomics expert, so famous that
your reputation has reached the Galaxy Zorbag where a group of friendly,
superintelligent space aliens live. They've always planned to visit Earth one
day, but they've worried about how they would adapt to an environment like ours.
<p>Hearing about your skill and creativity in designing tasks, tools, and
settings for human beings, they've just communicated with you telepathically and
told you they'll be coming soon for a yearlong stay. They'll need a place to live
and work during their visit. They know how to access our "primitive"
computers, so they'll need comfortable workstations as well. Since they'd like to
do some sightseeing, they'll also need transportation.<p>The problem is, like
most space aliens, the Zorbagians have some peculiarities:<BR> . 
<ul>
<li>They have three heads, with one eye stalk in the middle of each and one antenna on top of each stalk.<BR> 
<li>They have three tentacles with four fingerlike digits and retractable claws.<BR>
<li>They have three legs.<BR>
<li>They have short, scaly tails.<BR>
<li>They're allergic to the sun and the color red.<BR>
<li>They require a constant, ongoing supply of
water.<p></ul>
Your mission is to come up with ideas to help them adapt to this
environment. You want them to be comfortable and productive as they live and work
here. You need to protect them from any problems they may encounter, and still
make them feel at home. Since this is such an important intergalactic visit, you
have unlimited access to manufacturing plants and production facilities. All you
have to do is come up with the design ideas. So go to it! The Zorbagians are
coming soon!<p>
<ul>
<li>Work in teams of four.<BR>
<li>Focus on one problem or one setting at a time. Group major and minor problems.<BR>
<li>List any additional Zorbagian information you would like to have before you
begin your design work.<BR> 
<li>Try to imagine yourself as a Zorbagian in each setting. Have you overlooked 				any possible
problems? <BR> 
<li>Draw sketches of the Zorbagians and the settings
and products you've designed for them.<BR> 
<li>Share your design ideas with the other teams in your class. <p>
</ul>

<center><img src="illustrations/Ergnmc.gif"></center>

Questions<BR> 
1.  Did any teams come up with similar ideas? Work as a class to select what you think
are the most workable design ideas.<BR> 
2.  What kind of process did your team go through when working on this project? What were the main problems you
encountered? How did you solve them?<p>

Ergonomics is a relatively
new science, although its basic principles are as old as the first humans who
adapted a tool for their environment. Go to the library and research when and why
ergonomics was first used in industry. (Here's a hint: World War II and
aircraft.)<p>

<p>

Corn has always played an important role in the lives and culture of the Maya people. 
In fact, the Maya creation story states that the flesh of humans came from sacred ears 
of <A NAME="maiz"><I>maiz</I></A>. According to this story, the Creators saw people as a milpa, or cornfield, 
ready to serve them. <p>

But apart from information we can gather through Maya legends and traditions, how do we 
know that corn was indeed an integral part of this culture and made up 80% of the Maya 
diet thousands of years ago? To answer questions like this, many scientists, including 
anthropologists, archaeologists, chemists, biologists, botanists, and ethnobotanists, 
must work together.<p>

<I><A NAME="ethnobotany">Ethnobotanists</A></I> are scientists who study the role of plants in a society. To better 
understand how a particular culture interacted with plants in the past, ethnobotanists 
look for clues in many places. They can learn a lot by finding out how an area's 
current society uses plants.  <p>

When you visit the areas of Mexico and Central America populated by five million Maya 
descendants, it's easy to see that corn continues to be the most important food in the 
Maya diet. Maya cooks soak kernels of dried field corn in water and lime and then grind 
the mixture with a <A NAME="mano"><I>mano</I></A> and <A NAME="metate"><I>metate</I></A> to make the thick <A NAME="zacan"><I>zacan</I></A>, just as their ancestors 
have done for thousands of years. They pat the zacan into <A NAME="tortilla"><I>tortillas</I></A> or fill it with 
meat, fruit, or chiles, and then wrap it with corn husks or banana leaves and steam it 
to make <A NAME="tamale"><I>tamales</I></A>. They even use ground corn to thicken atole, a drink often sweetened 
with fruit or <A NAME="chocolate"><I>chocolate</I></A>.<p>

But ethnobotanists need to examine information from sources other than present-day 
society. Paintings, carvings, figurines, and other art discovered at ancient Maya 
temple ruins reveal that corn played an important role in religion as well as diet, 
confirming that the Maya revered the maize god.   <p>

Since plants exposed to the elements decompose quickly, ethnobotanists also analyze 
soil samples taken from archaeological sites. They look for pollen, charred seeds, or 
food remains stuck in the bottom of broken pots. Then they study these fragile remains 
to analyze the plant's DNA and to compare it with that of the plant's contemporary 
descendants.  
<p>
Ethnobotanists contribute much to our understanding of how the Maya have interacted 
with the plants in their environment for thousands of years. These scientists can show 
us how ancient customs translate into modern life and suggest methods to conserve the 
traditional ways of a proud culture such as the Maya.  <br>
<ul>
<li>What other peoples in the world rely on corn as a dietary staple? 
<li>How important is corn in your own diet?
<li>Popped kernels of corn several hundred years old were discovered with
mummies buried in  the ruins of a community in Paracas, Peru. What foods other than corn have been around 
that long? 
<li>Ask grandparents or friends how their diets have changed over the past 50
years.</ul><hr>

Ethnobotanists make many discoveries by studying soil samples. As you work through 
several rounds of soil and water separation, try to imagine that you are working at an 
archaeological site and that your findings could reveal the way people lived and ate 
thousands of years ago.<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>

<UL>
<LI>  notebook for observations
<LI>  pencil
<LI>  clear plastic 2-cup containers with lids
<LI>  water
<LI>  bag of soil--allow about 1 kg (2.2 lbs) per person
<LI>  1 paint tray per person (the kind used with roller brushes)
<LI>  about 1 cup each of dried corn, dried green and yellow peas, lentils, rice, and beans
<LI>  flower seeds
<LI>  grass seeds
<LI>  pepper
<LI>  sand
<LI>  glitter
<LI>  paper towels, coffee filters, cheesecloth, or screen material
</UL><p>
<ol>
<li>  Work in teams to create at least six different mixtures to analyze. They
might  include combinations of soil and grains, sand and glitter, pepper and grains, grass 
seeds and soil, etc. Try to include different weights. 
<li>  Place each mixture in a different container and secure the lid. Label each mixture 
with a letter or number that doesn't reveal the contents. Keep track of the contents of
each mixture in your notebook.
3.  Trade mixtures with another team. Your goal will be to determine the contents of 
the mixture in each jar. 
<li>  Shake each container well. Remove the lid and check the mixture. Has anything moved 
to the bottom or top of container? Record your observations.
<li>  Add enough water to make a soup the consistency of broth. Secure the lid and shake 
well.
<li> Pour each mixture into a paint pan. Heavier matter in the mixture should filter out 
of the liquid and remain at the higher level in the pan. Liquids should flow to the 
deeper end of the pan and lighter matter should float on top of the liquid. Use paper 
towels, cheesecloth, or a screen to filter the liquid into another container. What's 
left in the filter? What's left in the liquid? Record your observations.
<li>  After you have repeated this process of separation for each mixture prepared by the 
other team, draw conclusions about the contents of each mixture. Ask the other team to 
check your findings.
<li>  Now that you've tried this activity indoors with mixtures you created, take your 
ethnobotany skills outside and collect real soil samples. Determine what methods of 
soil separation to use and record your findings.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="ethnobot.GIF"><p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<OL>
<li>  How does soil and water separation work? Can you think of substances that
could not  be separated using water?
<li> Ethnobotanists use soil separation in their research. What other
scientists use  this process as well?</ol><hr>
<A NAME="try this"></A>

<IMG SRC="leaf.gif"><H3>TRY THIS!</H3>
Look at pictures of Maya art. Look for representations of corn and other plants. Create
a clay figure or a drawing that represents foods most important in your own
culture.<p>

<IMG SRC="leaf.gif"><H3>TRY THIS!</H3>
How much do you know about the ethnic groups that live in your community? Visit a large
grocery store and list as many products as possible that come from other countries. 
Visit local ethnic markets and note which plant foods seem to be most prevalent. 
Talk to the store owner about how the foods are prepared. You may need to ask someone 
in the store to translate the labels for you.<p>

<IMG SRC="leaf.gif"><H3>TRY THIS!</H3>
The ancient Maya numeration system used base 20, unlike the Hindu-Arabic system which 
uses base 10. Research the Maya numeration system, as well as other systems, and 
compare them with the system you use. Two good references are Multicultural Math

<p>
Would you know what to do if a fire suddenly broke out in your home? You
need to understand how fire burns, how heat energy is transferred in a
fire, and how to protect yourself and others from it.
<p>
Imagine a <A HREF="#triangle"><i>fire triangle</i></A>--one side is <A HREF="#oxygen"><i>oxygen</i></A>, one side is fuel, and one
side is energy. Fire needs a source of oxygen (air, ozone, etc.) which
chemically combines with fuel at a high enough <A HREF="#temperature"><i>temperature</i></A> to maintain
the fire's <A HREF="#combustion"><i>combustion</i></A> process. If one of these three factors is missing,
fire cannot exist. Fire fighters extinguish fires by removing one or
more of the sides of the triangle.
<p>
Burning releases chemical energy, resulting in increased molecular
motion and emission of electromagnetic waves. This increased molecular
motion is detected as a rise in temperature. The energy is removed as
heat by conduction, convection, and radiation. To occur, chemical
reactions like burning often require a high molecular agitation--that
is, a high temperature.
<p>
Conduction is the transport of heat through solids by direct contact.
This transfer goes from molecule to molecule down the chain, like a row
of dominos.  You feel the effect of conduction whenever you touch a hot
object.
<p>
Convection is the transfer of heat in fluids. The process begins by
heating a fluid. As the fluid warms, it becomes less dense and rises.
Colder, denser fluid then sinks down and takes the place of the warmer
fluid, creating a <A HREF="#cell"><i>convection cell</i></A>.
<p>
Radiation is the transfer of energy through empty space or transparent
materials. The energy travels in waves from the source, such as the
energy that travels from the sun to Earth or the heat you feel coming
from a stove. Radiation causes the temperature of materials around a
fire to rise. If the temperature increases, the material may reach its
ignition temperature and burst into flames, adding more fuel to the
fire.
<p>
Almost 70% of fatal house fires occur at night. Smoke is the most
frequent cause of death, since it displaces the oxygen we breath and
fills the air with poisonous toxins. After only a few seconds in a
smoke-filled room, you can become disorientated and experience distorted
judgment.
<p>
You should know what to do in the event of a fire. Plan escape routes
from your apartment or home and practice using them. Install smoke
alarms and maintain them by cleaning and testing them monthly. Learn
fire prevention and safety procedures so you know what to do if a fire
breaks out.

<h2><b><A NAME="MAIN">Main Activity</a></h2></b>
<p>
The greatest threat to individuals in a fire is the smoke and toxic
fumes generated from burning materials within a structure. Smoke quickly
and easily moves upward through passages and openings, such as stairs
and heating ducts. To understand why smoke rises so quickly, you must
first understand the heat transfer process known as convection.

<li>incense stick 
<li>matches 
<li>a tall, 1-quart, large-mouth canning jar or mayonnaise or spaghetti
<li>sauce jar with screw-top cap  three small blocks of wood or other
<li>suitable replacements  cup of sand
</ul>
<b>Caution: This activity involves an open flame. All participants must
use safety glasses and follow safety procedures. This should be done with
adult supervision.</b>
<ol>

<li>Form into a group of four and gather your materials.

<li>Arrange the wood on a flat stable surface so that a triangle forms in
the center of the three pieces. Allow a slight opening at one corner of
the triangle.

<li>Remove the cap from the jar and place the jar upside down on the
wood, making sure air can flow into it.

<li>Practice placing the unlit incense stick through the opening between
the wood blocks. Hold it under the mouth of the jar. 5. Have your
instructor light the incense stick. Place the lit incense under the
middle of the jar's opening.

<li>Allow the incense to burn under the jar for two minutes. Observe how
the smoke behaves.

<li>Next, screw the cap on the jar and place the lit end of the incense
in the cup of sand.

<li>Draw a diagram of the convection cell.

<p>
It's hard to believe that a small, slow-running stream could cause harm. During a flood, 
however, even the calmest brook can become a torrent and cause unforeseen misery and 
damage. <p>

Many people like to live near a body of running fresh water. Rivers and streams provide 
recreation, food, and, of course, drinking water. But when rain or melting snow 
produces large amounts of water, rivers and streams may flood, causing problems for 
those who live nearby. Although we describe floods as disasters, they are, in fact, 
natural phenomena.
<p>
Floods occur when a <A NAME="watershed"><I>watershed</I></A> receives so much
water that its waterways cannot drain it  off properly. A watershed is an area of land (usually quite large) that drains into a 
river or stream. A small river will drain several thousand or hundreds of thousands of 
<A NAME="acre"><I>acres</I></A> of land. Within any one watershed, excess rain
will cause increased water levels  downstream. What occurs at any point along a river can affect not only that point but 
also the entire watershed.<p>

To minimize the effects of a flood, engineers build <A NAME="levee"><I>levees</I></A> to constrict the overflow of  rivers. As more communities build levees, the water in a river is forced to run at a 
higher level because it cannot spread out. As the water runs at a higher level, it 
deposits sediment and raises the <A NAME="riverbed"><I>riverbed</I></A>. The
situation worsens as the water rushes  downstream. The water level can only continue to rise, eventually spilling over the 
levees. During prolonged periods of flooding, many levees give way because they are 
under pressure from the swollen river and are being undercut by water seepage. <p>

Floods in <A NAME="undeveloped"><I>undeveloped areas</I></A> are not as
damaging as the floods in <A NAME="developed"><I>developed areas</I></A>. First
of all, many natural areas have thousands of acres of <A NAME="wetlands"><I>wetlands</I></A> which act as giant  sponges to soak up excess water. 
Second, many rivers overflow into the <A NAME="floodplain"><I>floodplain</I></A>--a low,  flat area on either side of the river. <p>

If a river is allowed to spread out onto its floodplain, the flow downstream is slowed. 
A river's floodplain can accommodate huge amounts of water which are <A
NAME="divert"><I>diverted</I></A> from the  main channel and held back. Allowed to flood in this way, the river creates less damage 
downstream. If humans do not interfere with it, a stream or river produces its own 
flood control system.<br>

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
The presence of a natural floodplain is crucial to the management of floods. When water 
is allowed to spread out away from the main channel of a river, the river can 
accommodate more water. If, on the other hand, a river's flow is prevented from 
spreading, the only place for the water to go is up. An increase in water height means 
higher water pressure and an increase in damage. How does the spreading out of river 
water make a difference?  How does it decrease water pressure? Try the following 
activity to get the "feel" of water at different depths. <p> 

<h3>Materials</h3>
<UL>
<LI>roll of clear plastic (poly), 6 mil or thicker, wide enough to produce at least two 
3.7 meter x 3.7 meter (12'x 12') sheets
<LI>garden hose
<li>supply of water</UL><br>

Number of people:  Eight or more. If you have fewer, cut down on the size of the 
plastic sheet.
<ol>
 <li>Find a level, soft surface outdoors that is close to an outdoor water
 spigot.  Lay  the plastic sheet flat on the ground. Depending on the thickness of your plastic, you 
may want to use two sheets to increase strength.
<li>Organize participants around the perimeter of the sheet so that everybody
is at  equal distances from each other.
<li>Each participant should firmly grab the plastic sheet with both hands. 
<li>All participants should come together towards the center to form a large
"bowl" out  of the plastic. Come together as close as possible. You can bunch up the plastic a  little on your legs. There should be about 1.2 meters (4') between you and the person 
directly across from you on the plastic sheet.
<li>Begin filling the plastic with water from the hose.
<li>From here on, the goal is to put as much water as possible into the plastic
without  letting any escape. You can move about in any way you want to increase the capacity for 
water. See what you learn about the force of water. How much water can you
hold?</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="floods.GIF"><p>

<h3>Questions</h3><ol>
<li> How does this activity compare to actual watershed problems? What are the 
similarities and differences?
<li>What is the best arrangement to hold the greatest amount of water? What
arrangement  requires the least effort? How deep a pool of water can you create? Can you devise a 
way to estimate the total number of gallons you can hold?

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
What are the sources of water pollution in your area? One of the largest pollutants 
could be city sewage. Call the local sanitation utility to find what is done to sewage 
before it is dumped back into the stream or river. Visit a sewage treatment
plant.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Where does the water you drink come from? Does it come from a river? A lake? 
Underground? Call the city water department to find out. Ask to visit the water 
treatment plant.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Does a river run through the city where you live? Look on a map and see whether you can 
find any large cities that do not have rivers. List them. Where would their sewage go? 
Where would their water supply be?
<p>

<p>

As you go through an average day, how many sounds around you do you actually hear? 
Every time you close a door, do you listen for the click of the lock? Do you hear the 
clink of a glass as you set it down? Although you may not actively hear these sounds, 
if they weren't there you'd wonder what was missing. Foley, the process of creating 
incidental sounds, is the art that completes a film--all by adding sounds for which you 
never really listen.<p>

Whether they're tearing heads of cabbage for a paper shredder in The Temp or 
<A NAME=the temp><I>The Temp</I></A> "smooshing" gelatin in T-shirts for
E.T.'s wobble, foley artists add sounds that  make the experience more real for the audience. The process is named for radio and 
movie sound pioneer Jack Foley, a technician at Universal Studios in the 1950s who 
became famous for synchronized sound effects.<p>

Foley artists begin their work by watching the film to determine which sounds need to 
be replaced, which need to be enhanced, and which just simply need to be added. At 
this time, the sound on the film includes all of the <A NAME="dialogue"><I>dialogue</I></A> and sound effects  created during the actual
production of the film. These sounds are recorded on a  production track or guide track.<p> 

Later, technicians may add crowd noises (also called <A NAME="walla"><I>walla</I></A>), the musical <I><A NAME="score">score</A></I>,  rerecorded dialogue or ADR (automated dialogue replacement), sound effects, and 
sound-designed effects. It's not unusual to have 80% of a movie's sound track added 
and altered in some way after the movie is shot.<p>

Some sound effects are common and can be pulled from prerecorded audio libraries. But 
many are unique to each movie--footsteps, for instance. As they watch the film, the 
artists identify which sounds they need to create and start thinking of ways to make 
them. In addition to the noises themselves, the foley artists must consider other 
factors, such as who makes the sound and in what environment. Some sounds are too 
complex for one take, so the foley artists carefully combine different noises to 
fully represent a single sound. In some cases, foley editors can digitally alter 
recorded sounds to fit a scene exactly.<p>

In a foley studio, you'll find different surfaces for walking on, a 
<A NAME="splash"><I>splash tank</I></A>, <I><A NAME="echo">echo chambers</A></I>, and a 
mixing booth where the sound engineers record and mix everything.  Foley artists 
spend hours huddled around a microphone, reading <A NAME="cue sheet"><I>cue sheets</I></A> and watching a huge  screen as they
meticulously synchronize their noises to the action.<p>

So the next time you see a movie, listen very carefully. If you don't notice a thing, 
you've got a foley artist to thank.<p>

How many different sounds can you create with just ten items and your tape recorder?
For starters, you'll experiment with each individual material and see how many sounds 
you can make. Then start combining them. As you become more familiar with the 
properties of different materials, think about other sounds you can create with them.


<H3>Materials</H3>
<UL>
<LI>  ball bearings
<LI>  balloons (uninflated)
<LI>  bottle of carbonated water
<LI>  bottle of noncarbonated water
<LI>  cellophane
<LI>  cylindrical oatmeal carton
<LI>  Popsicle sticks
<LI>  rubber bands
<LI>  sandpaper
<LI>  stiff pieces of cardboard
<LI>  tape recorder</UL><p>
<ol>
<LI>  Experiment with each of the above items to create different noises. Try
  creating  new sounds by manipulating two or more items in combination or changing the environment
you are in. Feel free to cut things apart, glue them together, or do whatever else 
inspires you. Decide what actual sounds your sound effects could represent. 
Tape-record your sounds. When you finish, write out a list of what each sound on the 
recording represents, as well as how you created it.<p>
<LI>  Now, your debut as a foley artist! Play the sounds for a few friends. Do
  they  recognize what you intended the sound to be? If you like, draw pictures or add 
dialogue to the sound effects to make the noises more recognizable.<p>
<LI>  Using your new sound effects as inspiration, write a short scene for the
  radio.  See how many different sound effects you can incorporate. How would you write this 
scene differently if sound effects weren't available to you? Record and share your 
scene. And when famous Hollywood producers want to hire you to do foley on their 
films, remember the folks at NEWTON'S APPLE who gave you your start!</OL>

<h3><A Name="try this"><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</A></h3>
In the NEWTON'S APPLE foley segment, Peggy learns that there are several different 
sound elements in the dinosaur egg hatch--the cracking egg, the sticky membrane, and 
the motion of the baby dinosaur. Can you identify the different elements of other 
sounds? For instance, listen to a watermelon being cut open. Or a box of cereal being 
opened. How would you categorize the different types of sounds?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Silent films depended on an organist in the movie theater to add the music and mood 
to make a movie complete. Rent a silent Charlie Chaplin film. Treat it as a rough cut. 
Watch the entire film with the sound turned off. What sound effects would you add? 
How would you do them?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Take a tape recorder on a walk with you. Really listen to the sounds around you and 
record sounds that you hear every day, but typically ignore. Choose your top ten 
favorites and play them for friends. How many do they recognize? How many stump them? 
You can make it tougher by editing out part of longer sounds. (Here are two to get you 
started--a parking meter and a light bulb being screwed in.)<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
In the early days of live radio, John Dennis invented a way to create the sound of 
thunder. His method of rattling a large piece of thin copper sheeting suspended by 
wires became so popular with others in the field that an irate Dennis accused another 
producer of "stealing my thunder!" Dig through your kitchen. How many ways can you 
steal some thunder? (Hint: Don't do this before 10 a.m.)<hr>

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
The case of the northern spotted owl points out why we need forest management
focused more on <A HREF="#ecosystem"><i>ecosystem</i></A> values than we've had in the past. Studies in Oregon
show that this owl's population declined by a third between 1976 and 1987. The
U.S. Forest Service estimates only 3,000 to 6,000 northern spotted owl pairs
remain in North America.
<p>
Each pair requires a range of 4,000 to 9,000 acres for hunting and foraging and
can nest only in the broken tops of dead "old-growth" firs. Because the spotted
owl was declared an endangered species, a court injunction halted most timber
sales in national forests where old-growth firs are found.
<p>
But the importance of the complex ecosystem of an old-growth forest extends far
beyond the preservation of the spotted owl. Old-growth forests in the Pacific
Northwest are full of ancient standing trees, fallen trees, <A HREF="#snags"><i>snags</i></A>, and decaying
vegetation (fungi, lichen, and moss) which provide shelter and food to plants and
animals that cannot live elsewhere.
<p>
At least 118 known vertebrate species live primarily in old-growth forests; 41 of
these species cannot nest, breed, or forage anywhere else. New-growth forests are
managed <A HREF="#monoculture"><i>monocultures</i></A>--containing only a few species of trees that were planted at
the same time. These areas do not offer the same <A HREF="#habitat"><i>habitat</i></A> diversity for plants and
animals. For example, only nine mammal species make their home in <A HREF="#second"><i>second-growth</i></A>
forests of young firs and hemlocks, compared to 25 in old-growth forests.
<p>
The classic old-growth forests contain redwoods, cedars, Douglas fir, hemlock, or
spruce. These forests have at least eight big trees per acre that are older than
300 years or more than a meter (40 inches) in diameter at breast height.
<p>
Only 4.3 million acres of our old-growth forests remain, about one-third of it
protected in designated national wilderness areas in parks. The loss of the
old-growth Douglas fir is similar to the loss of the giant redwoods, originally
the greatest old-growth forest on earth. Less than 4% of the giant redwoods still
stand, mostly in roadside parks.
<p>
Loggers, environmentalists, and scientists have started to hammer out a new form
of forest management that protects the environment but attempts to endanger fewer
jobs. A better understanding of the value of forests will help them arrive at a
solution.

<h1><b>RING AROUND THE TREE</b></h1>
<b>Count the rings on a tree's trunk to estimate its age.</b>
<p>
<pre>
</pre>
<h2><b><A NAME="main">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2></b>
<p>
Trees grow both in height and in girth. The rings on the stump of a tree indicate
how many years have passed in the tree's life. Spring wood can be recognized as
light rings; summer wood as dark. One set of light and dark rings represents one
year. Paleoclimatologists trace climatic changes and other disturbances by
studying the ring patterns in old trees.

<p>
<b>Materials</b> 
<p>
Obtain a variety of cut round sections from large tree trunks. A local
tree service might provide pieces from different types of trees.
<ol>
<li> Make a sketch of the flat cut face of each trunk, showing all the rings that
appear.

<li> Count the number of rings across the surface of the trunk. (Count from the
center out; do not count the bark.) This corresponds to the tree's age. Label
each drawing.

<li> Post the sketches next to each other.

<li> Label the rings in your sketch to show several important historical events as
well as major occasions in your life. Is the tree as old as you are?

<li> Measure each trunk's diameter.

<li> Research why some rings are farther apart than others. Remember that wide
rings show periods of strong growth and narrow rings indicate adverse conditions.
</ol>
<img align=right src="Images/outgrowth.gif" hspace=10>
<b>Questions</b> 
<ol> 
<li> Does the diameter of the tree always correspond with its age? Why or
why not? 
<li> What are the oldest trees in the world? In the United States? 
<li> What environmental factors might have encouraged growth? What might have hampered the
growth of the tree? 
<li> Can you think of an environment where it would be
difficult to determine the age of a tree because there were no growth rings?
</ol>

Exposing the hidden world under a log can be a revealing experience!
The damp, rotting underside of a log can provide a home to a whole community of
creatures--caterpillars, mites, snails, slugs, spiders, termites, beetles, ants,
wood lice, and millipedes. If you find a dead tree, peel away some bark to look
for tunnels underneath it. (Never remove bark from a living tree!) Do any
insects, worms, or grubs live under the bark? Find some dead logs and sketch the
variety of life you find under them. What is the largest creature you found? The
smallest? How do these creatures return nutrients to the soil to feed the plants
and trees? What animals rely on dead matter to survive? How can we protect these
small creatures?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
You can make a terrarium out of a big jar with a lid. Place the jar
on its side in a small rack with slots to keep the terrarium from rolling
sideways. Place a layer of small stones on top of a layer of sand in the jar and
then lay down a layer of forest soil or potting soil. Collect some specimens from
the forest. (Be sure to obtain permission first.) For example, a fresh acorn will
sprout into a small oak. Wrap specimens in newspaper until you can plant them in
the terrarium. After you've planted them, spray two or three squirts of water
over them. Replace the lid after punching several holes in it. Why shouldn't you
water the terrarium very often?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
You'll find biodiversity in many environments. Collect a leaf from
each type of tree in a small, natural setting (your neighborhood or a local
park). Make a leaf print of each to record texture, contour, and detail. To do
this, place each hard, thick-veined leaf between two pieces of strong, thin
paper. Rub one piece of paper with a thick pencil or graphite stick, or even a
crayon. You can also make rubbings of tree bark to record variations in bark
patterns. Tie lightweight paper around the tree with a string and rub over the
paper with a dark wax crayon, from which you've peeled the paper wrapping. Rub
steadily in one direction. (Smooth barks produce the best rubbings.) Don't strip
bark from trees--this will injure or kill the tree.

<i>How does physics play a role in Frisbee flying?</i></center><p><hr>
<p>
<ul>
<li>How does a Frisbee fly?  
<li>Why is a Frisbee shaped the way it is?  
<li>What would it be like to compete in a world championship Frisbee competition?  
<li>How fast and how far can a Frisbee go?
</ul>
David learns the many different ways that Frisbees fly and the mysteries of disc physics.
<hr><CENTER><B>Discussion</B></CENTER><p> 
In the late 1940s Fred Morrison performed some experiments with flying discs.  Some of the 
discs he experimented with were made out of metal while others were formed out of a new 
material called plastic.  In 1955 the Wham-O Company purchased the rights and molds from 
Morrison.  It wasn't until the early 1960s when Frisbees became the rage.  Whamo-O's former 
General Manager Ed Headrick provided the organization and groundwork for the growth of the 
Frisbee craze.  Today organized competitions take place each year around the world 
culminating in the World Frisbee Competition in California.<p>

Two factors influence the flight of a Frisbee, <A href="#gravity">gravity</a> and air.  Gravity acts on all objects 
the same way, accelerating their mass towards the center of the Earth at 10 meters/second.  
Once in the air, <A href="#lift">lift </a>and <A href="#angular momentum">angular momentum</a> act on the Frisbee giving it a ballet-type 
performance.  Lift is generated by the Frisbee's shaped surfaces as it passes through the 
air.  Maintaining a positive <A href="#angle of attack">angle of attack</a>, the air moving over the top of the Frisbee 
flows faster than the air moving underneath it.  Under the Bernoulli Principle, there is 
then a lower air pressure on top of the Frisbee than beneath it.  The difference in pressure
causes the Frisbee to rise or lift.  This is the same principle that allows planes to take 
off, fly and land.  Another significant factor in the Frisbee's lift is Newton's Third Law 
which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  The Frisbee 
forces air down (action) and the air forces the Frisbee upward (reaction).  The air is 
deflected downward by the Frisbee's tilt, or angle of attack.<p>  

Spinning the Frisbee when it is thrown, or giving it angular momentum, provides it with 
stability.  Angular momentum is a property of any spinning mass.  Throwing a Frisbee without
any spin allows it to tumble to the ground.  The momentum of the spin also gives it 
orientational stability, allowing the Frisbee to receive a steady lift from the air as it 
passes through it.  The faster the Frisbee spins, the greater its stability.<p><hr>  

<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>  Does the thick rim of the Frisbee affect its flight?  
<li>  What happens when you throw a Frisbee straight up?  How do you aim a Frisbee? 
<li>  What other sports use spin for better performance?</ol>

<b>Flying on Paper!</b><p>
Discover the best conditions for Frisbee distance flying!<p>

<b>Main Activity</B><p>
By graphing the results of various tosses you will be able to calculate the average distance
you can make a Frisbee fly and discover the best conditions for distance flying.<p>

Materials: <ul>
<li>Frisbee
<li>Tape measure
<li>Paper
<li>Pencil</ul><p>
<p>
1.   Divide your class into equal teams.  Take turns throwing the Frisbee.<p>
2.   Measure the distance from where you began to toss the Frisbee to where it hits the 
ground.  Record your distances in a log.<p>
3.   After everyone has recorded the distances of a few tries, calculate the average distance
of your team's throws.<p>
4.   Compare your average to the other teams.  Record the averages in your log and create a 
graph to represent your data.<p>  

<b>Questions</b><p>
1.   What caused the Frisbee to fly the farthest? The shortest?<p>
2.   What could be done to improve the flight of the Frisbee?  Experiment with your ideas to 
see if you can make it fly farther.<p>
3.   What would the best weather conditions be for distance flying? How might strong winds 
affect the distance a Frisbee could fly?  Why?<p>

Learn more about the three axes of motion.  Stand with your arms extended straight out from 
your sides like the  wings of a plane.  Bend over at the waist and then bend backwards to 
imitate pitch.  Lean your body from side to side to simulate a roll.  Now rotate  or twist 
your body at the waist to do a yaw.  What other moves can you imitate?  Which ones are the 
hardest to do?<p>

lift?  Build a paper airplane and fly it.  What physical forces affect its flight?<p>   

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
What would it be like if you were a Frisbee?  Would you like to live on a Frisbee or travel

What would you do if there was a strong storm coming?  How would you navigate?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
Invite a couple friends to help you calculate the velocity and acceleration of a Frisbee 
toss.  Take turns acting as the time keeper, data recorder and tosser.  Use a stop watch to 
time how long the Frisbee is in the air and a tape measure to determine the distance it 
travels.  Record the data from each toss.  Try calculating different kinds of throws like 
ones into the wind, with the wind and across the wind.  Which direction works best?  Does a 
fast flying Frisbee travel farther than a slower one?<p><p>

Why make maps of the galaxies?<br>

 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Edwin Hubble's proof that the universe is dynamic and that our Milky Way is not
the lone <a href="#three">galaxy</a> provoked a renewal of questions and theories.  Understanding
the positions, distances, and distribution patterns of other galaxies not only
provides mapping information; it gives perspective on what the earth's
relationship is to the overall universal plan;  it provides clues about the
earth's origin; and it gives a type of structure to an indistinct concept.
<p>
The <a href="#two">Doppler effect</a> can explain the <a href="#five">red shifts</a> found in the light 
from galaxies. According to the Doppler effect, the more that light is shifted to 
longer wavelengths (meaning toward the red end of the spectrum), the faster the source
of the light is moving away from the observer.  Edwin Hubble found that the
farther away the galaxy, the more its light is red-shifted.  This means that
the farther the galaxy, the faster it is moving away from us.  In other words,
the universe is expanding. 
<p>
Consider the universe as a huge ball of bread dough, speckled throughout with
raisins, each raisin denoting a galaxy.  There is no definite boundary or edge,
however. As this model universe is baking in the oven, yeast is making the dough 
expand.  The expanding dough carries the raisins farther and farther apart from each
other, but the size of each raisin does not increase.  In the same way, space
expands the distance between galaxies in the universe, but the galaxies
themselves do not get larger.
<p>
We are on the threshold of new discoveries about the galaxies.  Using the
latest technology, Margaret Geller and John Huchra are able to analyze "slices"
of the universe.  If the ball of raisin-bread dough represents the universe,
Geller and Huchra so far have mapped only four very thin slices of bread
that don't even go all the way through the loaf. Their mapping illustrates a 
definite pattern to galaxy distribution.  Galaxies appear to be positioned in a 
network of thin, curved walls that surround huge, nearly empty voids.  How empty 
the voids are and how they arose, no one yet knows.
<p>
The "Great Wall" of the universe is the largest structure known to humans, yet
its size, 500 million light years by 200 million <a href="#four">light years</a>, poses a challenge
to cosmological theories.  No one can explain how, if only known forms of
matter and known forces were at work, such a large structure was formed in the
time since the <a href="#one">Big Bang</a>.   Newer technologies and continued 
research promise to introduce new insights into the universe.

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
It's hard to imagine scientists having much to do with garbage. But as the solid
waste crisis grows, simple garbage disposal will require some high-tech
solutions.
<p>
While getting rid of garbage has always been a problem, it only recently has hit
epidemic proportions. For almost 7,000 years, people disposed of solid waste by
gathering it up, carting it out, and dumping or burying it in an isolated place.
Crude as it was, this system worked because most of the solid waste consisted of
biodegradable organic compounds that easily decomposed. In addition, the volume
of trash was much lower than now because there were fewer people and less
packaging waste.
<p>
Over the last 50 years new synthetic materials have been introduced into the
waste stream, complicating the problem. These materials are not biodegradable and
some produce toxic residue. This has led to tighter environmental controls on
landfills. With open space in short supply, many communities are literally
drowning in <A HREF="#solid"><i>municipal solid waste</i></A>.
<p>
Before a community can decide how to safely and efficiently dispose of solid
waste, it needs to define exactly what solid waste is. It may sound funny, but
all garbage is <i>not</i> created equally. Waste from industrial centers is very
different from the waste generated on farms. Urban apartment garbage bears little
resemblance to the household waste from suburbs.
<p>
Before composting, <A HREF="#recycling"><i>recycling</i></A>, or waste-to-energy systems can be considered,
scientists must analyze the waste stream in detail. First, investigators
calculate how much of the waste from many different samples falls into basic
categories, such as glass, plastics, metals, paper, and food waste. They can then
predict the <A HREF="#btu"><i>BTU</i></A> value of the garbage, the volume of recyclable material, and how
much of the waste is biodegradable.
<p>
Scientists also evaluate the effectiveness of different disposal techniques. If
you add up the amount of food, yard, and paper waste generated by a typical
American family, landfills appear an ideal option. After all, these
materials--which are biodegradable--make up almost 70% of the garbage.
Unfortunately, little oxygen or water exists inside a landfill  to help the
decomposition process. Scientists have found that even after 50 years, much waste
in landfills is still quite fresh. By monitoring decomposition rates and end
products from other disposal techniques, they can create disposal systems that
are safe, efficient, and economically viable.
<p>

<h1><b>GARBOLOGY</b></h1> 
<b>Discover if your garbage is "typically American" by conducting your own
waste stream analysis.</b>
<p>
<h2><b><A NAME="main">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></b></h2>
<p>
According to 1988 figures from the Environmental Protection Agency, the typical
American throws away about five pounds of trash each day. Of that amount, 40% is
paper, 17.5% is yard waste, 8.5% is metals, 7.0% is glass, 8.0% is plastic, 7.5%
is food waste, and 11.5% is miscellaneous materials. By analyzing your own
household waste stream, you can see how you compare.
<P>
<b>Materials</b> 
<ul>
<li> kitchen scale 
<li> bathroom scale 
<li> large plastic bucket 
<li> rubber gloves
</ul>

<ol>
<li> Set up a data chart with the categories listed in the solid waste breakdown
above. To be accurate, you must weigh your waste every day for a month. (Note:
Adapt time frame to fit your schedule.) For even greater precision, place
cardboard, magazines, and newspapers into a separate category from other paper.
If you currently recycle or compost any household waste, include the material in
the weight analysis, and then keep a separate column for items recycled.  This
line will serve as a credit on your final garbage balance (so subtract this
weight from your total garbage weight).
<p>
<li> Each day, separate your garbage into the various components to be weighed.
Wear plastic or rubber gloves. To minimize mess, store and weigh organic food
waste in a plastic bucket.  Make sure you subtract the weight of the bucket each
time you weigh the materials in it and wash it out each night.  Weigh other
materials like cans, bottles, and plastic containers when they are empty and dry.
You can use a box to weigh them, but make sure you subtract the box's weight. For
yard waste and larger bulk items, use the bathroom scale and record the weight to
the nearest kilogram or pound.
<p>
<li> After recording the data for a month, add up the total weight for each
category. Then add up all of the category subtotals to get the number of pounds
of solid waste generated by your family in one month. Divide this number by the
number of people in your household. Remember, babies count as a whole person!
<p>
<li> Divide each category subtotal by the total weight of garbage produced to get
the weight percent for each category. If you do recycle or compost, divide that
amount by the total amount produced to determine how much you are saving. Make a
chart or graph of each category.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b> 
<img align=right src="Images/garbage.gif" hspace=10>
<ol>
<li> How do your numbers compare with the national averages? What factors
might account for the differences? 
<li> How would your numbers compare if you kept
track of your garbage for a whole year? Are there any seasonal variations in
waste generation? 
<li> How much could you effectively reduce your household waste
by using a source-management program, such as composting yard waste and recycling
newspapers, bottles, and cans?

<p>

Garlic is often called "the stinking rose." That's because it contains <I><A NAME="molecule">molecules</A></I> 
composed of the same <A NAME="atom"><I>atoms</I></A> that lurk in burnt matches and rotten eggs.
<p>
But if you put a whole clove of garlic right up to your nose, you won't smell much. 
The molecules that create the garlic smell are not actually present in natural garlic.
They are synthesized in a reaction that occurs when garlic is cut or crushed. When a 
knife slices through garlic, cell membranes rupture, releasing an <A NAME="enzyme"><I>enzyme</I></A> called 
allinase. Allinase can chemically change a tiny, odorless molecule called alliin into 
allicin. Allicin is the <A NAME="pungent"><I>pungent</I></A>, sulfur-containing molecule that can alienate friends 
who get too close and add zest to bland food.
<p>
During any chemical reaction, atoms rearrange themselves into new substances. But all 
chemical reactions do not proceed in the same way. Some transformations occur 
spontaneously and explosively while others are hard to initiate and proceed as slowly 
as a rusting fence. The ease and speed with which molecules change or undergo chemical 
reaction depend on how often they collide and the energy needed to get the reaction 
started. 
<p>
Molecules are surrounded by negatively charged <I><A NAME="electron">electrons</A></I> which repel the electrons in 
other molecules. For each reaction, molecules must move fast enough to overcome these 
repulsive forces. This energy barrier is like crossing a mountain. Just as an ocean 
wave may have enough energy to knock you off your feet, a molecular collision must 
have enough energy to break chemical bonds. If the <A NAME="reactant"><I>reactant</I></A> molecules have enough 
energy, they can climb the energy mountain, react, and fall down the other side as 
<A NAME="product"><I>products</I></A>. 
<p>
Usually you can give molecules extra energy and make them collide more often by 
heating them up. But alliin and allinase only need to meet at room temperature to 
create allicin.
<p>
The secret is in the structure of the allinase enzyme. One section of the molecule is 
called the <I><A NAME="active">active site</A></I>. In a typical enzyme, the active site looks like a dent or 
crevice in the side of the molecule. The shape of the crevice in allinase exactly 
matches the molecular shape of alliin. The enzyme and <I><A NAME="substrate"></A></I>substrate fit together like a 
key fits a lock. At the active site, alliin is stretched and twisted until chemical 
bonds holding it together snap and allicin is formed. Allicin, which no longer fits 
the enzyme, drifts away, leaving allinase unchanged and the whole process starts again.
The enzyme facilitates the reaction by reducing the energy needed to break chemical 
bonds. Alliin and allinase have found a low-energy tunnel through the energy mountain. 
<p>
After ingestion, the <A NAME="odoriferous"><I>odoriferous</I></A> sulfur molecules circulate in the bloodstream and 
escape from your body through exhaled air and perspiration--as any nose will tell you.<BR>

ordinary hydrogen peroxide molecules into water and oxygen gas. Can catalase break 
down other molecules? Do all plant or animal products contain catalase? Let's find out.<p>

<LI>  potato, bread, apple, turnip, cheese, vinegar, and milk</UL><p>

<ol><LI>  Cut off the end of a small potato to expose the inner surface. Do not peel

Draw a Venn diagram to represent how many of your classmates enjoy cooked garlic and 
how many like it raw. Where do you place the students who do not like garlic at all? 
Next, create and conduct a survey to see which garlic-flavored foods your classmates 
enjoy. Organize this information on a histogram (bar graph) and a circle graph. Which 
graph do you believe will best represent the information? Why?<p>

Usually an increase in temperature will increase the rate of a chemical reaction. 
You can demonstrate this effect with two Alka Seltzer tablets. Alka Seltzer tablets 
contain dry chemicals that react in water to release bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. 
Pour cold water into one jar and hot water into a second jar. Now drop a seltzer 
tablet into each jar. What happens?<p>

Garlic odor can be controlled by cutting. In a group, separate a garlic bulb into 
individual cloves. Now peel three of the cloves. Place one of the cloves on a paper 
plate. On a second plate, cut a clove into four sections. On a third plate, crush or 
mush a complete clove. Invite the members of your group to smell each sample and 
compare observations of odor intensity.<hr>

<h1>Glass Recycling</h1>
What happens to my glass bottles after I put them in a recycling bin?<br>
<hr>
</center>
David finds out how his soft-drink bottle ends up on the grocery-store shelf
again.<br>
Segment length:  5:13
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Given the overcrowding of our landfills and the impact they have on the
environment, fewer and fewer landfills are being built.  Of the ones that are,
very tight regulations are imposed.  Communities across the country are
reacting to this by developing and encouraging the use of recycling programs.
The goal is to preserve our natural resources and save precious space in our
landfills.
<p>
Jars, bottles, and other containers are some of the everyday objects made from
glass that can be recycled.  Not all glass is recyclable.  Glass found in light
bulbs, cookware, and window panes is made by incorporating ceramics with the
glass.  This type of glass is not recyclable because doing so would introduce
impurities into the recycling process.
<p>
Once the glass is picked up by a recycling truck, it is separated by colors.
Amber and green glass is made by adding a coloring agent during the original
glass-manufacturing process; this color cannot be removed.  Therefore, brown
bottles can only make other brown bottles.
<p>
When the glass is taken to a manufacturing or recycling plant, it is broken up
into smaller pieces called <a href="#one">cullet</a>.  The broken pieces are crushed, sorted,
cleaned, and prepared to be mixed with other <a href="#two">raw materials</a> in the glass-making
process.  The cost savings of recycling is in the use of energy.  When glass is
made from scratch, high temperatures are needed to melt and combine all the
ingredients.  Since cullet melts at a lower temperature, the more of it you add
to a batch of raw materials, the less energy you will need to melt it.<p>
Recycling glass is not only cost-efficient; it benefits the environment in
several ways.  Glass produced from recycled glass instead of raw materials
reduces related air pollution by 20% and related water pollution by 50%.
Throwaway bottles consume three times as much energy as reusable, returnable
containers.  And, recycling glass reduces the space in landfills that would
otherwise be taken up by used bottles and jars.  <p>
<p>
Ten to twelve percent of the glass used in the United States is recycled.  Much
of the glass used is not recycled.  According to the Earthworks Group, about 28
billion bottles and jars are thrown away every year.  That's enough to fill
both towers of New York's World Trade Center every two weeks.<p>
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>
1.  What kind of recycling program do you have at your school or home?<br>
2.  Some recycling doesn't include destroying the old product to make a new
product, rather, it involves reusing the old product in a new way.  What kinds
of things are good candidates for reuse?  (e.g., milk cartons, detergent
bottles and boxes, clothing, toys)

 Main Activity</h4></a>
<p>
<center>
<font size=+4>Less Volume = More Space</h4>
See how compacting a container affects how much space it takes up.
</center>
<p>
You will find out how the volume of a container can be measured.  Using your
calculations, you will see the significance of compaction as it relates to
landfills.<p>

<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>glass, aluminum, and plastic softdrink containers (with tops or lids) of
various volumes, shapes, and sizes<br>
<li>large pail<br>
<li>pan or tray<br>
<li>water<br>
<li>graduated cylinders (250 ml or larger)<br>
<li>sand<br>
<li>tape measure<br>
<li>calculators (optional)<br>
<li>paper and pencils<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Divide your students into three groups.  Each group will have the task of
figuring out how to get the most containers into a 2-foot square area (your
"landfill").<p>
<li>Have each group select one type of container to conduct its tests on.<p>
<li>Each group can use any method it can think of to find out how much volume
its container has, i.e., how much space the container would take up in a
landfill.  Using the materials provided, have the students calculate the volume
of the containers and record their findings on a data sheet.  (Some ideas for
calculating volume include immersing the container into a bucket of water and
measuring the "overflow"; filling the container with sand and measuring that
amount; or using a measuring tape and calculating the container's
dimensions.)<p>
<li>Next, have each group compact its container to its smallest form and repeat
step 3.<p>
</ol>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  Which type of container had the least volume for a given size?  The
greatest ?<p>
2.  Which compacted container had the greatest volume?  The least?<p>
3.  Which type of compacted container could you fit more of in a landfill?<p>
4.  Which type of container was the easiest to compact?  Why?

Develop a glass-recycling project for your classroom, school, or home.  Discuss
what procedures need to be established, what products you want to recycle, how
they will be collected and recycled, and how the project will be organized.
Determine what your community already does for recycling.  Start a new
community project or add to the existing one.

Track for one week the type of glass you throw away or put into the recycling
bin.  Track the total number of pieces and the color of the glass.  Develop a
chart to record this information.  Learn how to calculate the percentage of
brown, green, and clear glass that you throw away.  Expand this activity by
counting other garbage you throw away or recycle.

Stores used to sell soft drinks in returnable glass bottles.  Some states
currently require that a deposit be paid on beverage containers; this five- to
ten-cent charge is reimbursed when the container is returned to the store.
Other states have programs that encourage consumers to recycle the containers.
Discuss or debate these practices.  Which one do you think is most effective
for encouraging people not to throw away recyclable materials?

Your fuel gauge is below empty. Both engines of the cargo plane you're piloting 
have just sputtered and gone silent. The nose of the plane points down and you begin
 a terrifying dive toward Earth. In a panic, you make your way out of the cockpit and
  into the back of the plane where your parachute is stored. But a 2,000-kilogram 
  crate is blocking your path. What do you do?
<p>
No problem! Since the weight of the crate on the plane's floor is actually zero, you
 would not have to lift it in opposition to <I><A Name="gravity">gravity</A></I> or slide 
 it in opposition to its friction with the floor. The <I><A Name="force">force</A></I> required to overcome the inertia of the crate
   would be small enough to allow you to move it by pushing hard with your feet braced
    against a wall. How is this so?
<p>
Let's look at the crate under normal flight conditions. The weight of the crate pushes
 down against the floor of the plane. What you might not realize is that the floor, 
 which is supported by the airplane's wings and the forces that keep the airplane 
 aloft, also pushes up against the crate. It pushes up with a force equal to the weight
  of the crate, so inside the plane, you're aware of how heavy the crate is.
<p>
When your plane goes into free-fall, the crate is still pulled by gravity just as 
during a normal flight. But the floor is no longer pushing up on the crate, since it
 and the crate are now falling freely toward the earth. Gravity is still acting on both
  the crate and the plane, but inside the airplane, without the upward push from the 
  floor, the crate now seems to be weightless. Both the crate and the pilot will float
   freely inside the airplane until something--like Earth--stops them.
<p>
Astronauts in <I><A Name="orbit">orbit</A></I> experience <I><A Name="weightlessness">weightlessness</A></I>
 just like objects in the falling aircraft. A space shuttle in orbit is actually in a state of free-fall as it travels
 around Earth. 
<p>
Hard to imagine? Picture yourself in a small spaceship a few meters above the ground.
 Now face the setting sun and go in a straight line for about 100 kilometers 
 (62 miles). If you go in a perfectly straight line, you should notice that Earth is
  curving away from you. 
<P>
A shuttle in orbit goes so fast that Earth curves "away" just as much as the shuttle
 falls. The shuttle falls, but never hits the ground! 

<p><ul>
<li>Falling appears to be different for different objects. For instance, which falls 
faster, a pen or a piece of paper? Why might one fall faster than the other? 
<li>In real life, when do you experience something like free-fall? For how long?

You have probably noticed an empty feeling in your stomach when an elevator starts 
its descent. That feeling is a result of a decrease of pressure against your feet and
 a corresponding change in the tightness of the muscles in your abdomen. Your feet 
 feel less pressure, because the floor of the elevator is going out from under you 
 momentarily. Find out how you could measure this feeling in more concrete terms, and 
 learn which elevator has the fastest acceleration.<p>

<p>
Usually, when somebody tells you to "take a flying leap," they don't really expect you
to fly. But you can if you know what you're doing and have a hang glider strapped on. 
Hang gliders work on the same principle as any winged aircraft. As the wings move 
forward, air is deflected above and below. The air traveling over the curved wing must
travel farther--and faster--than the air below. When air speeds up, it drops in pressure,
creating a low-pressure zone above the wing. This in turn gives the air traveling 
below greater relative pressure and the strength to push up the wing.
<p>
To become airborne, a hang glider's <I><A NAME="airspeed">airspeed</A></I> must
equal about 20 mph. Airspeed is a combination of the pilot's running speed and the 
speed of the wind coming toward the pilot. Many different combinations are possible. 
If a pilot is running at 20 mph, no wind is necessary. (But this is unlikely, since 
the world's fastest sprinters run only about 23 mph--without carrying hang gliders.) 
If the wind is blowing at 15 mph, the pilot need only run at 5 mph. A combination of 
a 10 mph wind with a 10mph run is considered ideal. 
<p>
As a wing lifts a glider up, gravity pulls it down. The two forces combine to create 
the gliding action, which is measured by the lift to drag (L/D) ratio. For instance, 
the average glider L/D ratio of 13:1 means that for every foot of drop, the glider 
sails 13 feet forward. However, pilots need to find constant upward forces to stay in 
the air for longer periods.
<p>
Thermals, huge masses of rising warm air, are what hang gliders ride to stay aloft. 
These thermals are formed near Earth's surface and depend on warmth from the ground. 
Flat fields, dark pavement, and low lying towns create heat early in the day, while 
wooded areas heat up more slowly and stay warm longer. Ridge lift is another power 
source. When a ridge or a hill deflects wind upward, gliders can "catch the wave!"
<p>
While suspended in the harness system, the pilot steers a hang glider by shifting his 
or her center of balance. Leaning forward and backward causes the glider to dive or 
climb. This motion changes the <I><A NAME="angle of attack">angle of
attack</A></I> and is used to take off and land, as well as to control speed during 
the flight. Shifting from side to side causes the glider to bank into turns. Pilots 
use a control bar to move their weight in relation to the wings. Other recommended 
equipment includes a helmet, parachute, <I><A
NAME="variometer">variometer</A></I>, and <I><A
NAME="altimeter">altimeter</A></I>.
<p>
Breaking gliding records is difficult, but designers are always trying to glide 
farther, faster, and higher. The new boomerang shaped SWIFT (swept wing with inboard 
flap) is capable of an incredible L/D ratio of 25:1 and has a top airspeed of 80 mph.
<br>

<LI>How would the altitude of your launching point affect your flight and the
equipment you would need? 
<LI>What sort of research could a pilot do before a flight to identify possible
thermal locations? 
<LI>You've seen hang glider pilots running into the wind to take off. Hang

<h2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2>
In this activity, you'll make a model of the countryside and a simple glider. Then, 
using a blow dryer as a wind source, you'll recreate the air currents and thermals 
that a hang glider would encounter.<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<UL>
<LI>  pieces of paper about 20 cm x 25 cm (about 8" x 10"). Get a few different
  thicknesses. 
<LI>  a room with open floor space
<LI> blow dryer with extension cord
<LI>  measuring tape
<LI> items to create different structures and landmarks. Be creative! You can
use  books standing on end to be buildings 	or lying propped open for cliffs. Cereal 
boxes, milk cartons, and teapots can be city skyscrapers. Pillows can be mountains, 
and so on.</UL><p>
<ol>
<LI>  Drop the pieces of paper just as they are to the floor from a height even
  with your chest. What happens? The air pressure below the paper is being released 
  in random spurts. Now fold the pieces of paper in half to be 20 cm x 12.5 cm 
  (8" x 5") and spread them open again. What happens now when you drop them, with the 
  fold crease down? The fold is dividing air pressure equally on either side of it. 
<LI>  Open the creased pieces of paper on a table and fold a long edge back about 2 cm
 (3/4"), creating a sort of lip. What happens when you drop the paper again? Keep 
 folding this edge over onto itself, 2 cm at a time, and keep dropping it until you 
 get a smooth gliding action. Why does this cause a forward motion? Can you figure 
 out a way to calculate the lifttodrag ratio, using the measuring tape? (Remember 
 the L/D definition--as the glider drops, how far does it move forward?) What thickness
 of paper has the best L/D ratio? Why?
 <LI>  Using the blow dryer on a low, cool setting, turn your floor into a hang
   glider's paradise. Have a friend sit on the floor and hold the blow dryer even with
   a structure, while you fly your gliders over, around, and through your buildings 
   and mountains. Create turbulence by shaking the blow dryer. Does a warmer setting 
   cause different flight patterns? Create the ultimate thermal by pointing the blow 
   dryer straight at the ceiling. Experiment using two blow dryers at once.
   Have fun!</OL><p>

(Hint: If you have trouble keeping the paper gliders aloft long enough to see the 
flight effects caused by your classroom countryside, try using air-filled balloons 
instead.)<hr>
<A NAME="try this"></A>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
The world records for distance in hang gliding are 488.49 km for men set by Larry 
Tudor in 1990, and 335.96 km for women set by Kari Castle in 1991. Matching these 
distances, where could you go if you were able to travel by hang glinder from your 
school?<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Get a topographical map of your city, as well as an aerial photograph. Plan a flight 
over the city in a hang glider. Can you identify which parts of the city will have 
thermals rising from them and which will be cooler? What areas would you want to fly 
over at 8 a.m.? Noon? 6 p.m.?<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Hang gliding pilots learn to "see" the air while they are flying. Stand outside on a 
breezy day. How many different ways can you determine what the air is doing? Pay 
attention to things such as how sound travels, how sun and shadows look on the ground,
dust and blowing objects, plants and trees, etc. As you do this, can you anticipate 
what the wind will do next, even before you feel a shift in the breeze?<p>

Headlines about hazardous material
<A HREF="#33">spills</A> can be scary. Sometimes entire communities must be evacuated until a spill
is cleaned up. Who performs this sometimes dangerous work? They're called
<A HREF="#11">emergency response teams</A>, and they have to be ready for just about anything.<P>
<A HREF="#22">Hazardous</A> materials are chemicals (such as paints or bug killers), biological
agents (such as disease-causing materials), or physical agents (such as
radioactive materials) that are dangerous to humans or to animals and plants.
Hazardous waste is unusable hazardous material that results from the activities
of human society. Research institutes, industrial plants, individual households,
and government agencies all generate chemical waste. About one percent is
classified as hazardous.<p>A hazardous spill occurs when hazardous material or
waste gets into the environment in an uncontrolled fashion. Many manufacturing
processes use hazardous materials or generate hazardous waste, but a hazardous
spill doesn't always come from a chemical plant or a factory. Any substance in
the wrong place at the wrong time in too large an amount can cause harm to the
environment. What if a tank truck dumps milk into a small stream, for example? Or
a giant vat of mayonnaise splits open at a food processing company? Those spills
may be classified as hazardous, too.<p>The response to a spill depends on the
situation. When the emergency response team is notified of a spill, it must
quickly decide what sort of danger is likely. Members of the team collect
appropriate clothing and equipment and travel to the scene. There they try to
contain the spill, sometimes testing a sample to identify it. If necessary, they
decontaminate themselves before leaving the area. Once the material has been
identified, other personnel arrive to remove it.<p>In the past, hazardous wastes
were buried in special landfills. Some industrial and government operations also
used fields, pits, ponds, and lagoons as disposal sites. Over the years many of
these leaked, contaminating soil and drinking water. Spill cleanup can take many
more permanent forms, including incineration, neutralization, and vitrification
(sealing the waste at high temperature in glass). New techniques look very
promising. For example, certain bioengineered organisms can digest specific
hazardous chemicals. Some of these organisms have already been used on oil slicks
from ocean spills.

<font size=+5>Stop the Spill</font>
<br>
Build a lakeshore and try to stop
hazardous waste from spreading through it.
</center>
<BR>
<P>
 
<BR> <p>A hazardous waste spill might look
or smell bad, but often the worst problem for cleanup crews is finding out where
it goes after it gets into the ground. How far do you think a hazardous waste
spill can spread? How can it be stopped, at least temporarily?

<P><b> Materials</b><BR> 
<ul>
<li>materials for simulating the geology of a lakeshore, such as
sand,aquarium gravel, clay,	 chalk, and a few
large stones (Try to obtain materials as lightly
colored as possible, to ensure 	clear observation of the
colors.)<BR> 
<li>large rectangular glass or clear <BR> plastic baking dish<BR>
<li>four colors of food coloring<BR>
<li>water<BR>
<li>miniature shovel (a toy or one
<BR> for house plant gardening)<BR> 
<li>a spray-type watering can to <BR> simulate
rain<BR> 
<li>narrow drinking straws, cut in 7.5 cm (3")
lengths<p>
</ul>
<img align=right hspace-5 src="illustrations/hazmat.gif">

1.  With the materials, build a model of a lakeshore in the baking
dish. Leaving a space for the lake water, build up the geology first with the
gravel and large stones. Add a partial layer of clay and then the sand and chalk.
Carefully pour water into the lake and allow it to seep under-ground. Add more
water if necessary to make it about .6 cm (1/4") deep.<BR> 
2.  Spill several drops of food coloring on your model, using different colors in different places.
Take core samples with the drinking straws in various places on the model to
track the progress of the spill, recording the results of the core analysis on a
chart. (These core samples will work best if the land parts of the model are
slightly moist.)<BR> 
3.  Spray water on the land part of the model, and evaluate
how this affects the spread of the spill.<BR> 
4.  Try various methods of cleaning
up or blocking in the spill, such as plastic wrap, clay, digging, etc.<P>

<b>Questions</b><BR> 

1.  What geological features does the spill spread through fastest?
In what direction does the spill spread? Does it get into the groundwater? How
long does it take to reach the lake? Are there geological features that prevent
it from spreading? How do you think the spill would spread if no water were
present? Do some of the spills meet underground and mix together?<BR> 
2.  How could you change the model to make it more realistic? What would you add or
delete?<p>

<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif"></a>
<br clear=left>
<BR> Take an inventory of the potentially hazardous chemicals
in your home and school. (Don't forget the art department-they use many paints
and solvents that are potentially hazardous.) Are the chemicals stored properly?
What can you get rid of? How can you get rid of them?<p>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
<BR> Study the
hazard warnings in a chemical supply catalog or on the labels of chemical reagent
bottles. Under what conditions would each of these chemicals be considered a
hazard? What specific problems would be caused if each of them spilled? Would the
location of the spill matter? How does the labeling differ between chemicals sold
for home use and for laboratory use? What would the best cleanup procedure be for
each one?<p>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">

<p>

Have you ever heard a ringing in your ears after a loud concert? Did sounds seem
muffled? These could be early signs of permanent hearing loss. Constant or even
occasional loud noises can damage your hearing beyond repair. More than 35
percent of the 28 million cases of hearing loss in the United States are caused,
at least in part, by exposure to hazardous noises. <P>
Hazardous noise can be anything from loud music to the sounds of a lawn mower. To
find out how hazardous a sound is, we measure its loudness in <A HREF="#33">decibels</A>, which
tell us its power or intensity. The decibel scale is logarithmic - each 10-dB
increase is a factor of 10.<P>
The normal human ear can hear sounds down to 0 dB. The roar of a rocket lifting
off registers over 140 dB. Experts consider noise levels above 85 dB hazardous,
particularly when you're exposed to them for long periods. The louder the noise,
the less time it takes to damage your hearing. Many rock concerts are 110 dB or
more. If you attend often, you can damage your hearing before you know you are in
danger. <P>
The ear has three parts - the outer, the inner, and the middle ears. The outer ear
includes the visible part outside our head and the ear canal, which ends at the
<A HREF="#44">eardrum</A>. The middle ear contains three tiny bones called <A HREF="#55">ossicles</A>. The inner ear
contains the <A HREF="#11">cochlea</A>, housing thousands of hair cells and nerve endings.<BR>
When sound waves travel down the ear canal and strike the eardrum, it vibrates.
This causes the ossicles to vibrate. The sound is then transmitted to the inner
ear. Vibrations set the fluid within the cochlea in motion, stimulating the hair
cells. The movement of the hair cells stimulates the auditory nerve endings,
which send the sound pattern to the part of the brain that interprets it.<P>
Hearing problems in the outer and middle ears can cause <A HREF="#22">conductive hearing loss</A>.
An example is otitis media, fluid in the middle ear caused by infection. These
problems can often be corrected with medicine or surgery. Sensori-neural hearing
loss is usually permanent and is caused by damage to hair cells in the inner ear.
When hair cells or auditory nerves are destroyed, they cannot be repaired. Loud
and persistent sounds can damage hair cells and cause permanent hearing loss and
<A HREF="#6">tinnitus</A>.<P>
Next time you listen to music, keep the volume low and rest your ears often. Use
earplugs at concerts. Remember, once your hearing is damaged by loud noise, it's
gone forever!<P>

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
We all value the muscles in our legs and arms. But the <A HREF="#heart"><i>heart</i></A> is the most
important muscle that keeps our bodies functioning. It pumps blood to
the brain and the rest of the body. And since blood transports the food
and oxygen our body cells need to survive, it's extremely important to
keep it flowing. 
<p> 
The average heart is about the size of an adult
fist and weighs 250-350 grams (9 ounces). It normally beats about 70
times per minute. Each beat represents a coordinated muscular
contraction conducted through a complicated nerve network. To beat
properly, the muscles of the heart must get an adequate blood flow
through the <A HREF="#coronary"><i>coronary arteries</i></A>. 
<p> 
Like soot in a chimney, <A HREF="#plaque"><i>atheromatous plaque</i></A> can build up in the coronary arteries, narrowing them and
reducing their blood flow. The heart then becomes "thirsty" for more
oxygen and nutrients, particularly when under demand for increased
output. The earliest symptom of this problem is mild chest pain, or
<A HREF="#angina"><i>angina</i></A>. When the blood supply to the heart becomes critically deficient
or blocked, a person suffers a <A HREF="#attack"><i>heart attack</i></A>. 
<p> 
Symptoms of a heart attack include severe, prolonged chest pain or pain that travels to the
shoulders, arms, neck, or jaw; shortness of breath; perspiration;
nausea; light-headedness; and irregular pulse. Immediate medical care
can greatly increase a patient's chances of surviving a severe heart
attack. Every second is crucial when a heart attack strikes. 
<p> 
If a person's heart stops, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)  may keep the
victim alive until emergency care arrives. At the hospital the victim
receives medicine to dissolve the clot that is blocking blood flow to
the heart muscle. Other medicines can relieve the chest pain and
strengthen the pumping force of the weakened heart. If the heart stops
or begins beating erratically, physicians often restart it with an
electrical shock called defibrillation. 
<p> 
A diseased heart can be treated surgically or medically. Common surgical methods include
coronary angioplasty, coronary bypass grafts, and pacemakers. Physicians
do these surgeries to improve blood flow and stabilize the heartbeat.
<p> 
With medical management of coronary artery disease, physicians try
to prevent the development of atheromatous degenerative trouble. They
might put patients on a diet to lower their cholesterol level or to lose
weight. They may recommend exercise and stress reduction programs.
Doctors often prescribe medicines as well to control the pain of angina,
prevent irregular heartbeats, and strengthen a weakened heart muscle.

Obtain a cow's heart from a butcher or slaughterhouse. It is
virtually identical to a human heart. Use an anatomy book to identify
and label the important parts. These should include the aorta, pulmonary
artery, left and right atria, left and right ventricles, left and right
coronary arteries, and the four heart valves. Explain what happens
during a heart attack.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
High blood pressure (hypertension) contributes to more than
a million heart attacks every year. Invite your school nurse to come in
and speak about the dangers of high blood pressure. Ask that person to
take the blood pressure of some students and explain how blood pressure
is measured.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
Stress can cause heart disease. In a class discussion,
define stress, identify some stressful situations, and come up with some
possible ways to avoid them.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
Measure your heart rate per minute. Using figures from your
classmates, calculate the class average. At home, find the heart rates
of young siblings, parents, and grandparents. Share these with your

According to the Department of Agriculture, heart disease
can be linked to the consumption of partially hydrogenated oils in
margarine and vegetable shortening. Discuss alternatives to these foods.
Look at the ingredient labels on the containers of cooking oils,
margarine, or butter used in your home. Read the labels for ingredients
and analyze the fat content, calories, and sodium level in these food

<center><h1>HIGH JUMP</h1>
<i>How do high jumpers set new records?</i></center><p><hr>

David learns how physics helps high jumpers break records.
<ul>
<li>Would you like to be able to jump higher?  
<li>How do you feel when you figure out ways to improve your performance?  
<li>What are the benefits of combining science with sports?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>Discussion</B></CENTER><p>
The jump style called the "Fosbury Flop" dramatically revolutionized the high
jump.  Dick 
Fosbury's movement technique involves racing toward the bar in a curved approach,
lifting 
off with the left foot, pivoting the right leg backwards and sailing over the bar
backwards,
stretching the back and flipping the legs upward.  In 1968, Fosbury set a
personal and 
Olympic record of seven feet and four inches - a full two and a half inches
higher than the 
964 Olympic record.  By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic high jump finalists used the
Fosbury Flop.
<p>
All three phases of the high jump require allowing for and using different
physical forces. 
The approach involves accelerating the body along a curved path that leads up to
the bar.  
At that point, the jumper is actually leaning away from the bar, allowing for the

centrifugal force that will pull him or her into a vertical position for the
jump.<p>

The lift-off requires the jumper to overcome <A href="#gravity">gravity</a> by
launching directly upwards while 
pushing against the ground.  The greater the force applied to the ground, the
greater the 
force that returns to the jumper.<p>

Bar clearance requires careful management of the human center of gravity.  The <A
href="#cgrav">center of 
gravity</a> is that point where an object <A href="#balance">balances
</a>perfectly.  The force of gravity pulls down 
vertically and is concentrated at each object's center of gravity.  For an object
to remain 
balanced, the center of gravity must be on a vertical line with the point of
suspension, 
above or below it.  The ideal high jump position involves draping the body over
the height 
of the crossbar at the peak of the jump.<p><hr>

<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li> How would you practice balancing your center of gravity?  Why do you need to
go over the
bar backwards?  How does the center of gravity affect different animals when they
are 
jumping?
<li> In the 'Newton's Apple' segment on the high jump, Tom Ecker said that the
high 
jumper's center of gravity always follows a <A href="#parab">parabola</a>.  Is it
the same for a ball, a pen or 
a shoe?  Why or why not?</ol>

<h1><center><B>Activity Page</h1></center></b>

<b>Get Pushy!</b><p>
Experiment with biomechanics to improve the height of your jump.<p>

<b>Main Activity</b><p>
You can jump higher, too.  Experiment with different positions, styles and
techniques to 
find ways to jump higher.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/high.gif" hspace=10>
Materials:<ul>
<li>2-3 feet of butcher paper
<li>Colored chalk
<li>Tape</ul>
<p>
1.  Tape the paper up on the wall so it is about two feet above the jumper's
head.<p>
2.  Take turns standing with the right shoulder perpendicular to the sheets of
paper.  Hold 
a piece of chalk in your hand.<p>
3.  Jump from a standing position and mark the paper with the chalk at the high
point of 
your jump.<p>
4.  Experiment with different jumping styles to see if you can jump higher.<p>  
<b>Suggestions:</b><p><ul>  
<li>Start your jump from a squat position, with your arms above your head.
<li>Start your jump from a squat position, using your arms to pump.  
<li>Start your jump from a standing position, then squat, then jump.
<li>Take a running start then jump.
<li>Try your own style, using combinations of the above suggestions, or using
your own 
jumping techniques.</ul><p>

5. Record the success of the different styles you tried.<p>

<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  What ways can athletes combine their knowledge of physical forces to improve
their 
performances?  What ways can technology be used in this kind of research?<p>
2.  Why is the curved approach used in high jumping?  Are there any other track
events that 
use it?<p>
3.  How can high jumpers get the best use of their leg muscles?  How could they
add more 
power to the lift-off?<p>
4.  Find out what the "stretch reflex mechanism" is.  How is this helpful to
jumpers?  Is 
it helpful in any other sports?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>
Bend over and pick up something from the floor.  Describe how your center of
gravity 
changes.  Stand against the wall.  Without letting your feet or buttocks move
away from the 
wall, try to pick something up.  What happens?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Observe other sports that use physical forces.  Look at pictures or films of
sporting 
events.  Can you find the athlete's center of gravity in the pictures or in the
freeze 
frame shots of the film?  Invite a karate instructor to your class and ask him to
discuss 
the "physics of karate".  How do karate experts combine their centers of gravity
with 
momentum?<p>

Go to a basketball game and watch how the players lift-off and use their center
of gravity 
for balance.  Talk with the coach and ask how players can improve their styles by

consolidating physical forces in one direction.  What happens if the players are
blocked by 
the other team when jumping up with the ball?  How are forces used during free
shots?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430

Try some experiments with the balance beam in the gym.  Take some friends and try
balancing 
on the beam.  Discuss what is involved during a balancing act.  Try balancing by
holding a 
pole horizontally in front of you.  Does this affect how you stay on the beam? 
What 
happens if you use a shorter pole?  A longer pole?  How do tightrope walkers use
their 
center of gravity when performing feats on the wire?<p><p>

<center><h1>HIP REPLACEMENT</h1>
<i>How do artificial implants work in the body?</i></center><p><hr>

David learns how orthopedic surgeons are replacing diseased joints.<p>
<ul>
<li>How important is the hip for walking?  
<li>Why would someone need their hip replaced?  
<li>Would an artificial hip interfere with any normal activities?  
<li>How long will a new hip last?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>Discussion</B></CENTER><p>
The hip joint is located where the upper leg bone or femur meets the pelvis.  At the tip of the femur is a femoral 
head which is ball-shaped to fit into an opening in the pelvis called the <A href="#acetabulum">acetabulum</a>.  This ball and socket mechanism 
at the hip must be stable enough to bear the weight of the upper body and rotate freely enough to give the femur a 
free range of motion.  The bones of the acetabulum and the femoral head are separated by both <A href="#cartilage">cartilage</a> and a 
syrup-like lubricant called <A href="#synovial fluid">synovial fluid </a>which surrounds it to cushion the bones and keep them from rubbing together.
<p>
When walking and other simple movement requiring rotation of the hip become painful, or when a hip joint is traumatized 
or dislocated, an <A href="#orthopedics">orthopedic</a> surgeon will examine the patient and take X-rays of the hip joint.  A common cause of 
joint pain in middle or old age is osteoarthritis which causes deterioration of the cartilage and the growth of bone 
spurs.  When cartilage can no longer cushion the joint and is combined with the additional bone material, the grinding 
of bone against bone becomes very painful.
<p>
The practice of orthopedic surgery has evolved through the centuries from just physical manipulation of the 
musculoskeletal system to actual replacement of muscles, bones and cartilage with synthetic materials.  Total hip 
replacement has been used in the United States since 1971.  Today, hip replacement has become a routine operation with 
artificial hips designed and manufactured by computer.
<p>
During the hip replacement procedure, the head of the femur is removed and replaced with a titanium <A href="#prosthesis">prosthesis</a> or 
small metal ball.  The new metal femoral head is made stable by attaching it to a metal stem which is inserted into 
the thigh bone.  The acetabulum is then replaced by a metal cup.  While the range of motion after recovery from the 
surgery does not match that of the original hip, the constant pain of bone-to-bone contact is permanently relieved.  
<p><hr>
<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>Why do doctors use titanium for replacements?
<li>What other joints can orthopedic surgeons replace?

By taking a close look at animals' skeletons you will see how your pelvis and femur work together for movement.<p>

<b>Main Activity</B><p>
Other animals' joints work similarly to ours.  By investigating their skeletons we learn about the placement and 
functions of our own bodies.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/hip.gif" hspace=10>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Owl pellets (available from science supply stores)
<li>Tweezers
<li>Paper towels
<li>Vegetable oil
<li>Sand paper</ul>
<p>
1.   Place the owl pellet on a paper towel.  Gently pull it apart with the tweezers and your fingers.<p>
2.   Separate the bones and sort them by size and shape.  Look for the ball joints of the hind legs and the sockets of 
the hip bones.  Compare the size of the femur of your pellet with your classmates'.<p> 
3.   Fit the femur into the socket.  Move the leg around in the socket.  Add a few drops of vegetable oil and move the 
ball and socket again.  Use the sand paper to sand down the ball end of the femur and try it in the socket again.<p>
4.   Look for other joints that connect to form the skeleton.<p>

<b>Questions</b><p>
1.   What happened when you added the oil?  How did sanding the ball joint change the motion of the femur?  
What do you think happened to the cartilage?<p>
2.   What other joints did you find?  Was the movement the same?<p> 
3.   Could you rebuild the whole skeleton?  How could you display it?  (See Newton's Apple's "Dinosaurs: Assembly" for 
extra hints!)<p>


<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Interview a physical therapist about orthopedic surgery.  How do they help hip replacement patients recover?  Are there
special techniques used to build muscle tone or recover motion?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Look for evidence of man-made joints in common objects.  Make a list of all you find.  Does the joint restrict or 
enhance their movements?  What human joints are similar to a door hinge? <p> 

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Find out how much  we rely on joints to move.  Try walking without bending your knees, eating without bending your 
wrists and writing with only one bent finger.  Can you think of other joint challenges?<p><p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Explore the hip's range of movement with a friend.  Lie down on the floor face up and bend one of your knees to your 
chest.  Have your friend measure and record the distance from the middle of your kneecap to the end of your nose.  Now 
rotate your knee toward the middle of the body and measure the distance to the other kneecap.  Finally, rotate your 
knee away from your body and measure back to the other kneecap.  Repeat these procedures again but this time lift your 
leg of the floor and stretch it out to the side.  Measure from the ends of both big toes.  Switch places with your 
friend so you can compare your measurements.<p><p>

<h1>Hollywood Stunts</h1>
How do scientific principles "protect" stunt performers as they perform
dangerous feats?  What kinds of protective gear do stunt people use?  Why is
timing so important in stunts?<p>
<hr>
</center>
David "goes Hollywood" as he applies the principles of science to learning
about movie stunts.<br>
Segment length:  11:30
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</a></h4>
<p>
Hardly a movie made today is without some kind of amazing stunt work.  We all
are held breathless when a person falls out of a 20-story building or when a
heart-stopping car chase ends in a spectacular crash.  While these may seem to
be spontaneous events, every moment of every stunt is carefully planned and
controlled by the scene directors, who have an understanding of the basic
scientific principles at work.<p>
In falls, bodies obtain their speed because of the net <a href="#one">acceleration</a> due to the
forces of <a href="#four">gravity</a> and air <a href="#two">drag</a>.  On the earth, the acceleration rate of a
free-falling body is 32 feet per second per second of fall (9.8 meters per
second squared).  This means that for each second the body is falling, its
<a href="#seven">velocity</a> increases 32 feet per second, up to a limiting velocity of
approximately 125 miles per hour.<p>
As the velocity of a falling body increases, so does its momentum.  Momentum is
calculated by taking the <a href="#six">mass</a> of a body and multiplying that number by its
velocity.  When two things crash, it's the rate of change of momentum that
determines the <a href="#three">force</a> (or "wallop") and does the 
damage.<p>
To reduce the chances of damage or injury, stunt designers use devices that
stretch out the time it takes to stop a body's momentum.  These devices "soften
the blow," so to speak, both figuratively and literally.  The longer the period
of time used in changing the <a href="#five">momentum</a>, the less force will be released upon
impact.  Air bags are one of the devices used because they slow down the impact
of the falling body by allowing the body to displace a large volume of air.
The greater the displacement, the slower the final impact, and the less chance
of injury.  For very long falls of several hundred feet, stunt people often use
decelerators:  long elastic ropes that serve as a brake to limit the maximum
velocity.  <p>
In addition to having the proper equipment, stunt people must know about human
anatomy; they must practice a lot; and they must wear the right protective
gear.  Even with all this knowledge and training, however, stunt people can get
injured -- the scientific principles they use to their advantage can be just as
effective against them.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4><p>
1.  What are some of the ways that the human body naturally absorbs energy
during exercise?  <br>
2.  Why is it important that stunt people fall on their backs instead of face
down?<br>
3.  What properties should a material have in order to reduce impact or to
prevent a stunt person from being injured by fire?

<h1>Household Chemistry</h1>
What is a chemical reaction?  How can I do chemistry experiments at home?  What
is pH?  How can I tell if something is an acid or a base?
</center><hr>
David learns about chemistry from some household items and some uninvited
guests.<br>
Segment length:  7:15
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Chemistry is the study of the ways various substances are put together and
their reactions under different conditions.  It is a science that involves all
of one's senses:  seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, and smelling.  <p>
Chemistry is the study of matter.  <a href="#five">Matter</a> can be found in three basic "states"
or forms:  liquid, such as water, oil, and saliva; solid, such as wood, bone,
and stone; or, gaseous, such as oxygen, helium, and methane.<p>
The basic building blocks of matter are the <a href="#two">elements</a>.  Elements cannot be
broken down into simpler matter.  Whether in nature or in the laboratory, two
or more elements combine chemically to form a <a href="#one">compound</a>.  The combined form may
have different properties from the original elements.  For example, when the
element oxygen, a gas, combines chemically in one way with the element
hydrogen, also a gas, one compound that can be formed is water.  As a liquid,
it looks and behaves differently from the gaseous forms of hydrogen and oxygen.
A chemical change has caused this difference.  <p>
Two large and important groups of chemical compounds are acids and bases.
Water (H2O or H-OH) is both an acid and a base.  As its chemical <a href="#three">formula</a>
indicates, pure water has equal concentrations of H+ (hydrogen <a href="#four">ions</a>) and OH-
(hydroxide ions).  When the concentrations of those two ions are equal, a
substance is called neutral.  When there are more hydrogen ions than hydroxide
ions, that substance is an acid.  The opposite condition (more hydroxide ions)
makes a material a base.  <p>
Whether a compound is an acid or a base is indicated by its pH or "power of
hydrogen," which represents the amounts of acid or base in a solution.  Pure
water is neutral, and so registers 7 on the pH scale.  The lower the reading
below 7, the more acidic a solution is.  The higher the reading above 7, the
more basic a solution is.  The pH of lemon juice is about 2.3 -- acidic; the pH
of seawater is about 8.3 -- basic.  <p>
The cabbage-juice mixture used in the Newton's Apple segment contains compounds
that change color as the pH changes.  Therefore, it can be used as an indicator
to show different levels of the pH scale.  Litmus paper, which turns red for
acidic solutions and blue for basic solutions, or the pH kits used to test
aquariums, can also be used as indicators.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4><p>
1.  Be a chemist at home.  What are acids used for in your home?  How are bases
used in household items?<br>
2.  What are some of the signs of a chemical reaction occurring?  What kinds of
chemical reactions happen when you cook?

<p>

Is there anybody out there? Just as ancient explorers ventured out onto uncharted seas, 
astronomers have devised clever ways to explore space. Up until the early 1600s, the 
only tools people had for observing the night sky were their eyes and navigational 
instruments like sextants, astrolabes, and cross staffs. A major breakthrough came in 
1609 when Galileo borrowed an idea from a Dutch <A NAME="lens"><I>lens</I></A> maker and created the
astronomical telescope.<p>

With it, Galileo determined that Venus went through phases like our moon, that Jupiter 
had moons orbiting it, and that Saturn had protuberances of some kind. Based on these 
discoveries, he challenged Aristotle's Earth-centered model of the universe and the 
science of astronomy took a quantum leap forward. 
<p>
Over the next hundred years, telescope-making became a well-established art. Late in the 
1600s, Isaac Newton discovered that <A NAME="refracting"><I>refracting</I></A> lenses weren't the only way to bring 
distant objects close. By placing a <A NAME="concave"><I>concave</I></A> <A NAME="mirror"><I>mirror</I></A> at the base of a hollow tube, he 
could concentrate more light with much less distortion. Using these new <A NAME="reflecting"><I>reflecting</I></A> 
telescopes, astronomers like Caroline Herschel, George Hale, and Edwin Hubble pushed the
limits of the visible universe even farther.<p>

By the early twentieth century, reflecting telescopes grew to mammoth proportions. 
Because Earth is blanketed by a layer of air over 100 kilometers (62 miles) thick, 
ground-based telescopes must "see" through a soup of air currents, water vapor, and dust
in the atmosphere. This distorts the light passing through the atmosphere and ultimately 
the image collected by the telescope.<p>

The only way to get rid of distortion caused by the atmosphere is to place a telescope 
in orbit above it. In 1990, NASA used the space shuttle to place the Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST) in orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 613 kilometers (380 miles). 
HST is actually a combination of both optical and spectrographic instruments which 
capture light that is collected by HST's primary mirror. These instruments use computers 
to digitize images and send them back to Earth via radio transmissions. The digitized 
images are reassembled into pictures by computers on the ground. The primary mirror of 
HST is only 2.4 meters (8 feet) in diameter, which is small compared to many ground-
based scopes. But because it's above the atmosphere, it can capture light from a volume 
of space almost 300 times greater than Earth-bound scopes.<p>

Unfortunately, soon after its launch, project scientists found that the HST primary 
mirror had a slight imperfection which impaired its focusing power. In optical terms, 
this imperfection is called <A NAME="sper"><I>spherical aberration</I></A>. Shuttle astronauts repaired the 
problem and gave HST better <I><A NAME="focus">focus</A></I>. By having HST in orbit above Earth's atmosphere, 
astronomers have now seen further than anyone has seen before.<br>

<ul>
<li>Many critics argue that the money for government-funded space projects
could be better  spent here on Earth. Do the spin-offs and scientific knowledge gained from space 
programs justify their expense, or are they a waste of resources? 
<li>Do you think there is life on other planets? If so, how might we go about
contacting it?</ul><hr>

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
Have you ever wondered why the side mirror on your car says "objects in mirror are 
closer than they appear" or why your reflection always looks strange in fun house 
mirrors? This activity gives you the opportunity to experiment with several different 
types of mirrors to shed light on how they focus.<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<UL>
<LI>  flashlight
<LI>  comb
<LI>  small, flat mirror
<LI>  three 8 1/2" x 11" sheets of plain white paper
<LI>  darkened room
<LI>  pencil
  <li>large, shiny spoon</UL><p>
<ol>
<LI>  Lay the flashlight flat on a table on top of a piece of white paper. Make the room 
as dark as possible and turn on the light so that the beam spreads out across the sheet 
of paper. Take the comb and place it in front of the light so that the beam shines 
through the teeth. You should see a series of light rays spreading out from behind the 
comb.
<LI>  Take the flat mirror and hold it up on edge so that it is facing the light rays 
coming from the flashlight. Use your pencil to trace the pattern of light rays as they 
strike and reflect off the flat mirror.
<LI>  After tracing the pattern, label the page "flat" and put it off to the side. Put a 
new sheet of paper under the light and place the spoon in front of the light rays so 
that the back of the spoon is facing the flashlight. Trace this reflection pattern on 
the second sheet and label it "convex." (Note: To be able to draw the light rays 
reflected from the spoon, you must place the paper and spoon at the edge of the table so 
that the rays are reflected from the center--not the edge--of the spoon.)
<LI>  Place the third piece of paper under the light and this time, have the light rays 
shine into the bowl of the spoon. Trace this pattern on the paper and label it 
"concave." Turn on the lights and compare the three reflection
patterns.</ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="hubble.GIF">
<p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<OL>
<LI>  Compare the convex pattern with the flat pattern. How are they different? How might 
this explain why convex mirrors spread out the light from an object?
<LI>  Compare the concave pattern with the flat pattern.  How does this pattern explain 
why concave mirrors concentrate the light from an object? Can you identify the focal 
point?
<LI>  Based on your experiment, why do you think wider-diameter concave mirrors are used 
to gather light from very distant astronomical objects?</ol><hr>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Organize a star party for you and your friends. It's easy to do! All you need is a 
current star map available monthly in magazines like Sky and Telescope, Astronomy, or 
Natural History and a relatively dark place to view the night sky. You may want to 
contact a local amateur astronomy group to find out if they have regularly planned 
events. Or start your own club at school!<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Try your hand at building a simple reflecting telescope. Simple, inexpensive plans are 
available in various science project books found in most libraries. Many basic parts 
can be obtained from local hardware stores or from a source like Edmund Scientific (see 
resources).<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Contact a local observatory and see if they have any public viewing nights. You'd be 
surprised how many planetariums, colleges, and universities have facilities that are 
open to the public at little or no charge. If you have never seen the rings of Saturn 
or the Horsehead Nebula, it's well worth the trip.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Most people can see how dust, pollution, or even lights can interfere with viewing 
objects in space, but how can clear air obstruct a view? To see how simple heating and 
cooling of the air can cause you to see ripples through a telescope, try observing 
objects on the far side of a radiator when the radiator is hot. Another option would be 
to set up a hot plate on a table, turn it on high, and look over it at a small piece of 
aluminum foil taped to the wall behind it. If you're lucky, you should see the foil 
twinkle just like a distant star at night.

<BR> 

Life is full of ups and downs. Sometimes, though,
moving between these extremes can be quite entertaining. Just check out the human
slingshot-or ejector seat-ride. <p>The ejector seat ride has its roots in <A HREF="#two">bungee
jumping</A>. Both depend on the <A HREF="#four">elasticity</A> of bungee cords to provide a <A HREF="#five">force</A>. In
bungee jumping, the elastic force is used to negatively accelerate (decelerate)
and halt a jumper's body as it plummets toward the ground. The ejector seat works
in reverse. Elasticity overcomes gravity by yanking upward and positively
accelerating (propelling) the riders sky-high. <p>Riders are strapped into a
cage that has been pulled down to the ground, stretching the bungee cords
connected high above to maximize <A HREF="#eight">potential energy</A>. Then the entire unit is
released skyward, converting the potential energy of the bungee cords into the
<A HREF="#seven">kinetic energy</A> of the riders, shooting them 45 meters (150 feet) into the air. At
the moment of release, the rider feels the maximum <A HREF="#one">acceleration</A>. Of course,
energy is <A HREF="#three">dissipated</A> with each pass as heat is generated by friction between the
bungee cords and air and within the cords themselves. <p>The <A HREF="#six">g-forces</A> caused by
the bungee acceleration are the very same forces that affect race car drivers and
astronauts. Even when we're just standing around, our bodies experience the force
of 1g, as gravity pulls our bodies toward the center of Earth. On the ejector
seat, force due to the ride alone may be up to 2g, but the force your body feels
is actually 3g, once you add in gravity as well.<p>The sudden shifting of your
body's position upsets the fluid in your inner ear, affecting your sense of
balance and triggering responses such as an increased heart rate and tightening
of your stomach muscles. Your body seems incredibly heavy as g-forces push you
and the blood in your body back in the direction you started from. Your heart
works harder to get the oxygen- and nutrient-bearing blood back to the brain and
overworked stomach muscles. This creates a temporary chemical imbalance resulting
in faintness or queasiness.<p>At the moment acceleration stops and the bungee
cords stop pulling on you, the only force from then on is gravity-you actually
experience free fall. Somehow, your body adapts and often you even enjoy the
experience.<p>

<font size=+2>Connections</font><BR> 

1.  On the ejector seat, when gravity cancels out
upward motion, the rider returns in a brief free fall and is actually weightless.
On what other rides would you experience this? <BR> 
2.  In what ways do you
experience g-forces in your everyday life? (Hint: G-forces only occur during
acceleration-a change in speed.)

1.  First, go for a couple of rides. Pay attention to
when you feel heavy and when you feel light, when you feel your body pressed hard
against the seat, and when you feel disoriented or dizzy. <BR> 
2.  Next, sit
where you can watch the roller coaster go through its ride. Sketch out as best
you can a side view and an overhead view. <BR> 
3.  On your overhead view, color
in red the parts of the ride where you felt heavy, coloring darker and heavier at
the most forceful parts. This is where you were experiencing positive
g-forces.<BR> 
4.  Color in blue the parts of the ride where you felt light, as if
the restraining bar on your car was the only thing keeping you from flying out of
your seat. This is where you were experiencing negative g-forces.<BR> 
5.  How does this color map compare to your side view? Do positive and negative g-forces
correlate with altitude? Do they seem to be associated with certain parts of a
turn or an incline or descent? Now mark some dizzy or disoriented spots on your
color map. Are they associated with the positive or with the negative g-force
experiences?<BR> 
6.  Extra credit: If you hold a penny in the flat palm of your
hand (facing toward what is originally upward) throughout the entire ride, it
never falls out. Why? Is this due to g-forces or others?<p>

Both bungee jumping and the ejector seat ride depend on the

rubber bands of different sizes and lengths. Using the ruler as a launcher, shoot
the rubber bands into an open area where there is no danger of hitting anyone. Do
wide bands travel farther than thin bands of the same circumference? Why? How

Grab your board and hit the beach - it's surfing time again. But instead of baggies
and a tank top, you might want to put on a parka and thermal socks, because the
kind of surfing we're talking about only happens on solid water. That's right,
the topic is ice surfing, and it's the hottest sport on frozen lakes around the
world.<P>
Ice surfing is really a hybrid sport, mixing the speed of ice boating with the
agility and power of wind surfing. The ice surfing board is similar in size and
shape to a big skateboard. Most boards have two blades in the back for stability
and either one or two blades in the front to control the steering. Just like the
wheels on a skateboard, the blades on an ice surfing board are mounted on
flexible &quot;trucks&quot; so the rider can control the steering by leaning
forward or backward while standing sideways on the board.<P>
As with ice skates and ice boats, the blades on the ice board are quite sharp on
the bottom, putting a great deal of pressure on the ice below. This pressure,
combined with the friction between blade and ice, causes some of the ice to melt
directly below the blade. A thin film of water lubricates the ice under the
blade, which helps it glide smoothly over the ice. This really cuts down on the
<A HREF="#22">drag</A> and means that the ice surfer is actually riding 
on liquid water, not solid
ice. Because there is far less friction involved, ice surfers can go much faster
than wind surfers, often approaching speeds of 113 kilometers (70 miles) per
hour.<P>
Just like wind surfers, ice surfers <A HREF="#33">power up</A> on an ice 
board by using a sail. In
fact, most ice boards use the same type of sail as wind surfing boards. But
because there is less friction on the ice, an ice surfer can get away with a much
smaller sail. To make the board go, the rider sets her or his back to the wind
and sheets in by pulling in on the <A HREF="#11">boom</A> - a bar attached 
to the bottom of the sail.
As the sail catches the wind, the board starts moving forward. The highest speeds
are attained when moving nearly perpendicular to the wind. By trimming the sail
at the correct angle, the ice surfer can actually move almost three times faster
than the wind itself. It's not possible to sail directly into the wind, but by
<A HREF="#44">tacking </A>at an angle, surfers can zigzag across the 
wind, heading upwind little by little.<P>

<font size=+2>Connections</font><p>

1.  How do you think an ice surfing board would work if it were fitted with skis
instead of blades? <BR>
2.  Do you think it would be possible to adapt the design of an ice board to make
a two-passenger commuter vehicle? How might you do it?<P>

While it is impossible to sail directly into the wind, it is possible to move
upwind by sailing at an angle across the wind. This is called tacking. Construct
a simple model sail and test it to see what your minimal tack angle is.<P>
Materials<BR>
<ul>
<li>small lump of clay<BR>
<li>protractor<BR>
<li>pair of scissors<BR>
<li>transparent tape<BR>
<li>metric ruler<BR>
<li>unsharpened pencil<BR>
<li>clear plastic wrap<BR>
<li>plastic straw<BR>
<li>kite string about 30 cm (1') long<BR>
<li>blow dryer<P>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To construct your sail, cut a piece of plastic wrap into an equilateral
triangle whose sides are each 15 cm (6&quot;) long. Cut the straw to <BR>
14 cm and roll the clay into a ball. Insert the pencil into the clay so that it
is standing vertically. This will be your mast. Wrap one side of the triangle
around the pencil so that it overlaps about 1 cm and tape it in place. Thread the
string through the straw and tie one loose end around the base of the pencil
where it sticks into the clay. Hold the straw out from the mast and tape the
bottom edge of the plastic wrap to it. The straw will be your boom.<BR>
<li>Place your protractor with the zero point directly under the mast and press
the clay down to hold it in place. (The boom should line up parallel with the
zero line on the protractor.) Place your hair dryer's barrel 30 cm (1') in front
of the mast. Turn it on low and aim it directly at the mast. The sail should
luff. If the sail and mast blow over, move the dryer farther back.<BR>
<li>Slowly pull the loose end of the string out at right angles across the
protractor and watch the sail. As soon as the sail begins to fill with air,
measure the angle that the boom makes with the zero line on the protractor.
Repeat this so you get an accurate reading, and then average your readings.<BR>
<li>Place the hair dryer directly behind the sail at the same distance that you
had it in front of the mast. Start with your sail out perpendic-        ular to
the barrel of the hair dryer and slowly use the string to pull the sail in until
it ends up parallel with the wind direction. Watch the sail and mast and feel the
tug of the string as you do this.<P>
</ol>
Questions<BR>
1.  At what angle did the sail first fill with air when you were running into the
wind? What does this tell you about the minimum angle at which you can sail into
the wind?<BR>
2.  When you were sailing with the wind, at what angle did the sail appear to
have the most power? <BR>
3.  Can you calculate how far you would have to sail to move directly upwind one
kilometer?<BR>
4.  Why do you get maximum power out of a sail when it is at an acute angle to
the wind?<P>

<p>
When we talk about <A HREF="#infrared"><i>infrared radiation</A></i>, we're really talking about a particular
kind of light. If you combine infrared radiation with radio waves, microwaves,
<A HREF="#visible"><i>visible light</i></A>, ultraviolet radiation, X rays, and gamma rays, you'll end up with
a broad band of radiation frequencies called the <A HREF="#spectrum"><i>electromagnetic spectrum</i></A>. All of
these types of <A HREF="#radiation"><i>electromagnetic radiation</i></A> transfer energy through space via waves
of oscillating electromagnetic fields. What distinguishes them from each other
are the frequency of the oscillation and, consequently, the <A HREF="#wavelength"><i>wavelength</i></A>.
<p>
An object's molecules and electrons are always in motion, vibrating and radiating
electromagnetic waves. When the object heats up and its temperature increases,
the motion will increase and so will the average <A HREF="#wavefrequency"><i>wave frequency</i></A> and the intensity
of the radiation. You can see this at work in a toaster oven. When you turn the
toaster on, you can feel some heat, but you see no light. As more electric energy
is supplied and the wires get hotter, they begin to glow red. If you could really
turn up the power so that the temperature reached about 3,000*C, the wires, like
the filament in a light bulb, would glow white. The only problem is that they
would probably burn up before they reached that temperature.
<p>
British astronomer Sir William Herschel discovered infrared radiation around
1800. He used a prism and a sensitive thermometer to detect "invisible" light
found just below the red portion of the spectrum. The term infrared (meaning
"below red") came into use because it describes where you find it on the
electromagnetic frequency spectrum.
<p>
Any warm object gives off infrared radiation. But remember, warm is a relative
term. An ice cube in a cooler is warmer than a flask of liquid nitrogen, so it
gives off more infrared radiation. Using special infrared scanners, a
<A HREF="#thermograph"><i>thermographic</i></A> scanner takes these differences in radiation intensity, codes them
by color, and maps them out so that "hot spots" can be detected. With this
technology, engineers can find heat leaks in buildings, doctors can find hidden
tumors in the body, and biologists can even find diseased vegetation in a forest.
<p>
Infrared imaging can even have applications in space. Astronomers use infrared
imaging to detect warm dust around new stars not "hot" enough to give off visible
light. This gives them a more complete picture of the whole universe, seeing
where no one has seen before!

<h1><b>REMOTE CONTROLLING</h1></b> 
<b>You will discover how infrared radiation behaves compared to
visible light.</b>
<p>
<h2><b><A NAME="main">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2></b>
<p>
Most television remote control units work by means of infrared radiation rather
than visible light. That's why you can't see the beam go on when you change
channels. Because infrared radiation has a longer wavelength than visible light,
it behaves differently when it encounters objects that get in its way.
<p>
Using your television's remote control as a source of infrared radiation, you
will compare the behavior of a beam of infrared radiation to that of a beam of
visible light. You will see how each reacts when different materials are placed
in its path.
<p>
<b>Materials</b> 
<ul>
<li> television set and remote control unit 
<li> flashlight 
<li> cornstarch baby powder 
<li> clear glass of water
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Clear all obstructions between you and the television set. Darken the room as
much as possible. Stand about 3 meters (10') away from the set and test your
remote control unit to make sure it is functioning properly. Test your flashlight
by shining it against the dark television screen.
<p>
<li> Have a friend stand about halfway between you and the television, directly in
front of the screen. Try turning on the television using the remote control. Then
try shining the flashlight onto the television screen.  Observe what happens in
each trial. Have your friend move around and notice how both "light" beams
behave.
<p>
<li> Have your friend blow some cornstarch baby powder in the air between you and
the television and attempt to turn on the television through the dust. Repeat,
using the flashlight, and observe what happens when you aim it at the screen.
<p>
<li> Place the glass of water directly in front of the remote control unit and try
to turn on the television. Now shine the flashlight through it. Note what happens
in each case.
<p>
<li> Hold the remote control in your right hand and place your left hand at several
distances and angles relative to the remote control. Determine the conditions
under which your hand motion prevents the signal from reaching the television.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b> 
<ol>
<li> Which of the objects interfered with the flashlight beam? Which
stopped the infrared beam? 
<li> Why do you think infrared sensors are good at
detecting hot spots in forest fires, yet have problems detecting warm bodies in
the fog? 
<li> How does the longer wavelength of infrared radiation help to explain
your observations?
</ol>

<b><A NAME="try"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></A></b><p> Kodak has developed infrared film that works in a standard 35-mm
camera. This type of film can often be purchased at a well-stocked photography
supply store. You can set up a test experiment by selecting several different
targets and photographing them in both infrared and visible light. You'll be
amazed at what develops!
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Go into a dark room that has an incandescent light bulb controlled by
a dimmer switch. Observe the spectrum it produces through a diffraction grating
when the light is fully turned on. (See resources for diffraction gratings.)
Slowly turn the dimmer switch down while observing through the grating. What
happens to the spectrum? What connection does this have to infrared radiation?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> For over 10 years, NASA has photographed Earth in the infrared range
from satellites to measure long-term environmental changes. Contact NASA (see
resources) to obtain LANDSAT infrared images of your community and see how the
different "heat" colors show the commercial and residential developmental
pattern.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Radiometers--those things that look like light bulbs with a weather
vane inside--not only measure the intensity of visible light but react to infrared
as well. Conduct an infrared survey by placing the radiometer near a variety of
warm objects to see which has the most effect. The faster the "weather vane"
spins, the more intense the radiation. (See resources for radiometers.)

Push and glide. Push and glide. Faster and
faster, until you're cruising along somewhere near 25-32 kilometers (15-20 miles)
per hour. The wind whistles around your helmet. The wheels on your in-line skates
whisper as you race along. Science and math are a long way from your mind. But
they aren't a long way from the sport. Side-surfing, crossovers, backward
skating, swizzling, arabesques, and roller hockey all depend on physics.<P>
Physics is the science that tries to explain things like matter and energy.
Energy added to matter can produce motion. Motion can be changed by <A HREF="#three">force</A>. And
when you're having fun skating, serious forces come into play. <p>For starters,
you push and glide to increase your speed. But you aren't just moving, you're
moving in a certain direction-hopefully forward, though backwards works and
"down" happens a lot when you're first learning. Motion in a particular
direction is <A HREF="#six">velocity</A>. You increase your speed while trying to pass the slowpoke
on the bike in front of you, decrease your speed to let the five-wheeled in-line
racer pass you, or swerve to avoid a pothole. All of these actions involve
changes in velocity and are therefore <A HREF="#one">accelerations</A>.<p>Still not convinced that
something so popular could have anything to do with physics? Then how about
<A HREF="#two">center of gravity</A>? You may not realize it but you're finding your center of
gravity every time you try to keep your balance while you're slaloming, tweaking,
or wall-riding. And if you don't find it, you experience the forces of gravity
(and <A HREF="#four">friction</A>) firsthand. Ouch!<p>When you're stair-riding or checking someone
into the boards during a roller hockey game, you're dealing with another
principle of physics-<A HREF="#five">inertia</A>. Newton's first law of motion talks about inertia,
which is the tendency of a moving object to maintain a constant velocity. It's
the principle you benefit from in the "glide" part of "push and
glide." After you push, you'll keep on going until friction within the
wheels' bearings, between the wheels and the ground, and between you and the air
rob you of your forward motion.<p>The physics of motion - acceleration, velocity,
center of gravity, inertia, and friction - are all part of every in-line race,
hockey game, or zing around the park. Who knows - understanding the science better
may help you become a faster, better, and more powerful skater!<P>

<p>
<center>
<font size=+5> Be a Force on Wheels!</font>
<br>
Find out how many newtons you can generate with
your in-line skates.<br>
</center>
<BR>
<P><BR>
Arnold Schwarzenegger is a powerful human being, no
doubt about it. But how much force do you think he can generate in newtons? When
he holds a 300-pound barbell above his head, he's exerting 1,336 newtons of
force. Here's an activity that lets you figure out how much force in newtons you
generate on a pair of in-line skates.<p>
<b>Materials</b><BR>
<ul>
<li>in-line skates<BR>
<li>stopwatch<BR> 
<li>masking tape or chalk<BR>
<li>meter stick<BR>
<li>calculator<BR>
<li>human weight scale<p>
</ul>
1.  Weigh each person in your class.<BR> 
2.  For this
activity, you need to know the mass of each person. To do that, divide the weight
in pounds by 2.2. This is each person's mass (m) measured in kilograms. Record
the mass of each person on a chart. (For example, if Emily weighs in at 88
pounds, her mass is 40 kilograms.)<BR> 
3.  Predict which students in your class
will be able to generate the greatest amount of force (F) on a pair of in-line
skates.<BR> 
4.  On a gym floor (with masking tape) or in a parking lot (with
chalk), mark a starting line and another line (your distance, or d) 20 meters
away.<BR> 
5.  Have someone stand at the finish line with a stopwatch. Signal the
skater to go, pushing as hard as she or he can for the full 20 meters. Make sure
the skater and the stopwatch start at the same time.<BR> 
6.  Stop the stopwatch
when the person crosses the 20-meter mark. That number (in seconds) is that
skater's time (t).<BR> 
7.  Do this for as many students as you want, keeping
careful records. When everyone is done, you're ready to figure the average
acceleration (a). Acceleration can be calculated using the following formula: a =
(2 x d)/t^2. (If Emily covers 20 meters in 5.0 seconds, her average acceleration
is 1.6 meters per second squared. This means that she is adding one meter per
second to her speed every second.)<BR> 
8.  Now you're ready to figure the force
generated by each skater. Force is measured in newtons. One newton is the amount
of force you'd need to get one kilogram (2.2 lb) of mass accelerating at one
meter per second squared. You can figure out the force by using this formula: F =
ma. (Emily's force would be 64 newtons.)<BR> 
9.  Once you've figured out the
<img align=left hspace-5 src="illustrations/Inlins.gif">
force measured in newtons, convert newtons to pounds (newtons x 0.22 = pounds).
Remember that these are very rough calculations. We are assuming that
acceleration is constant and that all the force exerted by the skater goes to
increase speed (rather than to overcome friction and to push downward to avoid
slipping).<p>



<b>Questions</b><BR> 
1.  What do the final numbers mean? What does it mean
to have generated a force of so-many newtons or pounds? Compare this to your
weight in pounds. <BR> 
2. Who generated the greatest amount of force? Why? Were
your predictions correct?<BR> 
3.  Did each person's mass affect his or her
acceleration? How?<p><P><P><BR><BR>

<p>

You hear about a new, world-class biology research laboratory and decide to visit it. 
You look around the lobby, then find your way into the chemistry lab where you pick up 
a carbon atom. After you change the number of protons and adjust the number of electrons 
and neutrons, the atom informs you it's become oxygen. Suddenly, you notice that two 
biochemists have entered the room and are discussing an article from the latest issue of 
Science magazine. You greet them, then change the atom further so it becomes nitrogen 
before you head toward the library.<p>

The lab you have just visited is called the BioMOO biology center--and it only exists on 
a computer. You reach the lab through the <A NAME="internet"><I>Internet</I></A>, an electronic network that connects 
computers around the world. Scientists (and anyone else who is interested) can meet at 
the BioMOO labs without leaving their desks, simply by guiding their computers to make a 
connection through the "information superhighway."<p>

The Internet is sometimes called the information superhighway because it provides 
electronic pathways for transporting vast quantities of information from place to place 
all over the world. There is so much information available on the computers connected to
 the Internet that you could never look at it all. Students, researchers, hobbyists, 
 business executives, and other "net surfers" are constantly adding to it.<p>

The Internet is actually a rapidly growing network of networks. Thousands of 
universities, businesses, and other organizations have their own computer networks. 
These networks are connected to each other over high-speed data lines. Together, the 
computer networks form an information and communication web known as the global Internet.
More than 15 million people worldwide have logged onto the Internet, and approximately 
two million new people log on every month! <p>

Besides visiting world-class "virtual" biology labs, you can also get information on 
almost any subject area, from how to make recycled paper to what the President is 
scheduled to do that day. You can communicate by exchanging electronic messages (called 
<A NAME="e-mail"><I>e-mail</I></A>) delivered within minutes to people in almost any place in the world. You can 
meet enthusiasts interested in the same things you are--whether it's rap music or chess--
and join them in a conversation or a cross-continent computer game. You can join in 
collaborative experiments and share results with other students and teachers throughout 
the world. You can gather pictures, sounds, and software from space shuttle missions, 
science museums, or amusement parks. The possibilities increase daily.<p>

our society?

Newsgroups are electronic forums for discussing a topic. Through newsgroups, people with 
common interests can share information and ideas over the Internet. Thousands of 
Internet newsgroup topics exist, ranging from dance to artificial intelligence, from 
comic books to Brazilian culture. Anyone with a computer connected to the network can 
read or post messages to a newsgroup. <p>

In this activity, you will start and maintain a bulletin board to get a sense of the 
potential and pitfalls of on-line newsgroups.<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<uL>
<li>a bulletin board 
<li>pens and paper (recycled, if available)
 <li>pushpins or thumb tacks</ul>
<ol>
<li>Choose a topic for your bulletin board, such as football, music,
gymnastics, book  club, comic books, horseback riding, etc. Choose one that you find interesting or 
important and that you feel others would like to discuss. Give your board a name and 
label it so that others can see what the topic is.
<li> Begin your bulletin board by posting a message that you think will get
people  talking about the topic. Decide whether to moderate your board or leave it unmoderated. 
If you moderate it, anyone who wants to post a message needs to submit the message 
first to you. You then decide to post it, keep it, or give it back to the sender. If 
you decide on an unmoderated board, anyone can post a message directly onto the board. 
<li>Now, hang your board in an accessible place and invite others to add to
it.  
<li> As your bulletin board progresses, develop a list of frequently asked
questions  (FAQs) on your topic. Write up brief, straightforward answers for each question and 
post the list on your board. 
<li> Find out what it takes to keep people reading and contributing to an
interactive  bulletin board. </ol><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="internet.gif"><p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>How did your bulletin board evolve? Did it meet your expectations?
<li> What problems did you encounter in running your bulletin board? Do you
think the same  types of problems might develop in Internet newsgroups?
<li> How might your bulletin board benefit from being on the Internet and
allowing  participation from anyone in the world? What difficulties might develop?
<li> How might the way people participate in a bulletin board be different if
it's  electronic rather than on a wall with cards?</ol><hr>

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
Ever hear the phrase "test-tube baby"? Then you may know that it is a misleading way of referring to a baby conceived through in <i>vitro</i> fertilization.
<p>
All babies develop from two different cells that join together- the <A HREF="#sperm"><i>sperm</i></A> and the <A HREF="#ovum"><i>ovum</i></A>. Women are born with about a million reproductive ova that are produced and developed in the ovaries, organs which are located within the abdominal cavity. Men produce millions of sperm each day in organs called the testes. Knowing this, it seems that couples who want to become parents should have no problem doing so. But one of every 12 American couples who want to have a baby cannot. 
<p>
Infertility can be caused by any number of medical problems. Low sperm counts or poor-quality sperm sometimes cause infertility in men. Problems that affect <A HREF="#ovul"><i>ovulation</i></A> or the ability of the ovum to enter the <A HREF="#Falloptube"><i>fallopian tube</i></A> and move to the proper place for <A HREF="#fertil"><i>fertilization</i></A> can cause infertility in women. 
<p>
A couple is considered infertile if they do not conceive a baby after one year of sexual intercourse using no birth control. At that point, one of the options open to them is <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF). Normally, conception takes place inside a woman's body, in the fallopian tube. However, when a couple has difficulty conceiving in the traditional manner, in vitro fertilization allows for conception outside the body.
<p>
During IVF, a physician collects ova from the woman at the time of her ovulation, using a high-tech procedure called laparoscopy. The ova are put in a petri dish (or test tube) and sperm, provided by the man, are added to them. Because ova and sperm are so tiny, the physician handles them through a process called micro-manipulation, using microscopic tools. The sperm and ovum remain in the dish or test tube for a few hours to fuse together. (This is how the misnomer test-tube baby came about. It is misleading because babies cannot grow in test tubes.)
<p>
The next step is for the fertilized ovum to be transferred into the woman's <A HREF="#uterus"><i>uterus</i></A>. If the fertilized ovum becomes implanted inside the uterus, the woman becomes pregnant. 
<p>
While the very early stages of an <i>in vitro</i> conception take place in an unusual manner, the rest of the pregnancy, including the delivery of the baby, can be expected to take place normally. Even though conceived differently than most, the baby doesn't look any different and, in fact, is no different from other babies. The very first IVF baby was born in 1978. Since then, IVF has become a quickly growing field of medicine, showing how medicine and technology join together to overcome an obstacle of nature.

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>

People have always wanted to fly. Leonardo da Vinci, who often dreamed about
flight, drew intricate designs for several different flying machines. Among the
many scientists whose discoveries made human flight a reality are Sir Isaac
Newton (1642-1727) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782). Both are credited with
developing the scientific principles that explain how an airplane flies. However,
it was not until many years later, on December 17, 1903, that Orville and Wilbur
Wright actually applied these principles to successful airplane flight. Their
first flight lasted only 12 seconds, and they traveled only 120 feet. The entire
trip could have taken place inside of a 747.
<p>
Whether a single-seat propeller plane or a giant 747, there are four fundamental
forces at work in airplanes. Thrust is the forward movement of the airplane,
provided by the propellers or jet engines. Drag  is the opposing force of the
displaced air, the same force you feel walking into a strong wind. Gravity acts
on the airplane, pulling it down toward the earth, and <A HREF="#link"><i>lift</i></A> counteracts the force
of gravity, keeping the airplane up in the air. The lift force is equal to the
force of gravity when an airplane is in level flight.
<p>
<A HREF="#bernoulli"><i>Bernoulli's principle</i></A> helps to explain lift.  Bernoulli demonstrated that the
faster a <A HREF="#fluid"><i>fluid</i></A> moves, the less <A HREF="#pressure"><i>pressure</i></A> it exerts. An airplane wing is shaped so
that air (which is a fluid) moves faster over the top of the wing than it moves
under the bottom of the wing. As a result, there is greater pressure underneath
the wing than there is on the top of the wing, resulting in a net force which
"lifts" the wing.
<p>
The angle at which the wing meets the air (the angle of attack) also contributes
to lift. You can easily demonstrate this when you hold your hand out the window
of a moving vehicle and change the angle at which your palm meets the oncoming
air.  If the surface of an airplane wing meets the air at an angle, the wing
exerts a force on the air and the air exerts an equal force on the wing--an
effect which Newton described in his third law of motion. There are many other
factors that influence lift: the shape and area of the wing, the <A HREF="#velocity"><i>velocity</i></A> of the
airplane, and even the density of the air.
<p>
Pilots and aeronautical engineers use the forces involved in lift to help them
design and fly planes of all sizes and shapes. With the right lift, even a
870,000-pound jumbo jet can head for the sky.

<b><h1>PLAYING BERNOULLI BALL</b></h1>
<b>With a stream of air and Bernoulli's principle, you will
hold a ball in midair before hitting it into a target.</b><pre>
</pre>
<h2><b><A NAME="MAIN">Main Activity</a></h2></b>
<p> (also see the activity for Windsurfing: Show 1106)

Challenge your friends to a game of Bernoulli Ball. The game looks easy, but you
will quickly see that there are subtle forces at work which require shrewd
analysis and manipulation for accurate shooting.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><ul> 
<li> hair dryer with a cylindrical nozzle 
<li> Styrofoam ball, 4-5 cm in diameter (1 1/2" - 2") 
<li> a couple of cardboard boxes of different sizes
</ul>
<ol>
<li> The player sits in a chair or on a stool with the hair dryer "gun" about 1
meter (1.1 yds) away from the target box.

<li> Place the smaller cardboard box inside a larger cardboard box to serve as the
target. (Or cut and shape cardboard into curved sections and place in box, as
illustrated below.) If you position the back of the box against a wall, you won't
have to chase as many stray balls.

<li> Scores for each part of the target are:<br><ul>
<li>inner box 3 <br>
<li>outer box 1 <br>
<li>outside of boxes 0 <br>
</ul>
<li> Use the hair dryer on the cold-air setting. If there are low- and high-speed
settings, use the low speed.

<li> Each player is allowed five practice shots and five shots for official score.

<li> To start the game, turn the dryer on and point the nozzle straight up. Place
the Styrofoam ball in the airstream about 30 cm (1') above the nozzle.

<li> The player shoots the ball by smoothly tilting the dryer so that the ball
falls out of the airstream and continues on a curved path toward the target.

<li> If the ball hits the dryer, the player gets to try again.
</ol>
<b>Questions</b><ol>
<li> Why does the ball stay in the airstream when the dryer is pointed
straight up? 
<li> Does the ball fall out of the airstream as soon as you start to
tilt the gun? 
<li> Why does the ball leave the airstream when you continue to tilt
the hair dryer? 
<li> After playing the game, do you have any suggestions for
someone who has never played it?</ol>

Words like "jungle" and "survival" mean one thing in
cities and towns, but they mean something entirely different in the humid forests
of Belize. Show up for a trip into the jungle along <A HREF="#four">la ruta Maya</A> with
&quot;essentials&quot; such as chocolate bars, soda, and a CD player, and your
Maya guide would make you leave it all behind. The guide knows that to survive,
you need only four things-water, food, shelter, and fire. Each can be found in
the jungle, but you must know what to look for and how to use it.<p>
First, a few
safety tips. Never run from a jaguar - walk toward it, shouting and clapping.
Always run away from dangerous snakes like the wowla (boa constrictor) and the
poisonous coral snake and <A HREF="#three">fer-de-lance</A>. Stay away from most insects - many have
special defense systems, like the machacha, which emits a foul spray, and the
acacia ant, whose alarm <A HREF="#five">pheromone</A> can be smelled two meters away. Learn from the
natives, who rub garlic on themselves to ward off bugs and snakes.<p>Need water?
Springs, rivers, and lakes are obvious sources. But don't forget the water vine,
which grows throughout rain forests. It holds several gallons of <A HREF="#six">potable</A>
water - just cut off a meter or so and swallow the liquid as it pours out. You can
use large leaves on tropical plants to collect rainwater or dew. Or you can
collect water with a solar <A HREF="#seven">still</A>.<p>The rain forests are full of biologically
active <A HREF="#two">compounds</A>, many of which you can use for food or medicine. You can eat
edible tubers, such as potato, yuca, and boniato, but be sure you can distinguish
edible tubers from poisonous ones. For cooking and for warmth, you'll want to
gather firewood, leaves, and grass (all as dry as possible).<p>Local weather and
predators determine your shelter needs. Do you need warmth or just a roof? Are
there animals or insects to avoid? The Maya use <A HREF="#one">cohune palm</A> fronds to build
<A HREF="#eight">thatched</A> roofs on their huts. These roofs withstand rain and wind and last up to
15 years.<p>The sun and stars are reliable navigational tools. You might want to
brush up on your stargazing skills to figure out where you are.<p>Survival
requires that you use all your senses to know what resources - and dangers - are
around you. When you think about it, maybe jungle survival is not so different
from survival in your corner of the world.<p>

<font size=+2>Connections</font><br>
1.  Think about all
the things you own. Which are vital to your existence? Which could you live
without, and for how long?<BR> 
2.  What images does the phrase "living in
the tropical rain forest" conjure up? What about "jungle
survival"? What makes them different?<p>

<br>
Create an all-purpose
survival kit to keep in your family car or at home.<br>
</center>
<BR> <p>What situations might
leave you and your family temporarily stranded without electricity, food, and
shelter? How would you survive if you were stranded outdoors? In this activity,
you'll decide what you'd need in a survival kit to help you stay safe and
healthy.<BR><p>
<b>Materials</b><BR>
<ul>
<li>waterproof container(backpack or plastic box)
<BR><li>chart paper <BR>
<li>markers<BR>
<li>scale<p></ul>
1.  Make a chart with columns
for water, food, shelter, fire, and other needs.<BR> 
2.  Break up into small
groups. Choose a season of the year. Then brainstorm with your group to list
whatever each person thinks you might need in each column to survive for at least
a week in the outdoors during that season. (Remember that a brainstorming
session is not the time to criticize ideas - just write them down.)<BR> 
3.  For each item in your list, assign a number to indicate its priority. For example,
"1" could mean that the item is essential on a scale of 1 to 5, with a
"5" meaning that the item is probably not important. Allow time for
discussion.<BR> 
4.  Decide on the volume and weight of the survival kit. Estimate
the weight of each item that you want to include in your kit, and decide whether
you can include it. Would several people have to share carrying the weight?<BR>
5.  Make a list of items to include in the kit.<BR> 
6.  If possible, gather or
purchase the materials you selected, and make a sample survival kit. Weigh the
kit and make a note of how much space the kit will take up. Where will you store
it?<BR> 
7.  If you live where severe weather (hurricanes, snowstorms, flooding)
could cut you off from electricity, water, and food, put together a list of basic
supplies to keep on hand in case of emergency. Think about the little things,
too, such as a can opener and a good supply of batteries for your radio and
flashlight.<p>

Collect water by building a simple solar still. Dig a
hole about 1/2 meter (20") deep and 1 meter (40") wide. Place a clean
cup at the bottom of the hole. Sprinkle grass clippings or leaves on the side of
the hole. Cover the hole with plastic wrap (you may have to tape several lengths
together to cover the hole completely). Use rocks or sticks to hold the plastic
wrap in place. Place a marble-sized stone on top of the plastic. It should be
heavy enough to create a point where the condensation can collect and drip into
the cup. Now let the sun do its work. How long does it take to form condensation
on the plastic? Where is the water coming from? How long does it take to get 2 cm
(3/4&quot;) of water?<p>


<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
<BR> Humans develop survival skills for
different environments. List the skills needed by the following: a baby, a
soldier, a person in a wheelchair, a person who is blind, a person who can't
read, a prisoner of war, a person who is homeless, a person living near the
Arctic Circle, members of a tribe living in the Amazon jungle, a member of that
tribe forced to move to the city, a person forced to move to a new country.
Choose one of these people and write a story about survival from that person's
perspective. Read the story to your class.<p>


<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
<BR> Any sailor,
backpacker, or person who spends time outdoors will attest to the importance of
knowing how to tie different kinds of knots. Find a book on knots. Get a meter of
thin and thick rope for each person in the group. Practice making at least five
different knots. What is each one used for? Which one should you use to tie two
different kinds of rope together? Which is easiest to pull apart? Which would you
use to build a rope bridge?<p>

<p>
Ron McNair raises his hand and brings it quickly down onto a pile of concrete bricks. 
As he pulls back his left hand, his right hand smashes through the concrete, sending 
it crumbling to the ground. An exciting picture, but what is it doing in <I><A
NAME="Scientific American">Scientific American</A></I> magazine?
<p>
That powerful <I><A NAME="karate">karate</A></I> chop might remind you of the
superhuman feats found in Hollywood action movies. But the ability of karate experts 
to break bricks has an easy explanation in the principles of physics and physiology. 
In fact, karate experts view breaking bricks and boards as a demonstration of form and 
concentration. The true nature of karate involves a complete mental and physical 
discipline that goes far beyond simple hand strikes.
<p>
One key to understanding brick breaking is a basic principle of motion: The
more <I><A NAME="momentum">momentum</A></I> an object has, the more <I><A
NAME="force">force</A></I> it can generate. When it hit the brick, McNair's hand had 
reached a speed of 11 meters per second (24 miles per hour). At this speed, his hand 
exerted a whopping force of 3,000 <I><A NAME="newton">newtowns</A></I>--or 675
pounds--on the concrete. A slab of concrete could likely support the weight of a few 
people weighing a total of 675 pounds (306 kilograms). But apply that amount of force 
concentrated into an area as small as a fist and the concrete slab will break.
<p>
Another key to brick breaking lies literally in the palm of your hand. Feel the bone 
on the edge of your hand, directly below your little finger. This bone (known as the 
fifth <I><A NAME="metacarpal">metacarpal</A></I>) bears the brunt of McNair's
hand strike. Human bones can actually resist 40 times more <I><A NAME="stress">stress</A></I> than concrete.  (Picture a piece of concrete the size of a bone, and imagine how easily it would 
break.)  The natural engineering of the human hand also lessens the severity of the 
impact. The muscle, <I><A NAME="tendon">tendons</A></I>, 
<I><A NAME="ligaments">ligaments</A></I> and other soft tissue in the hand provide a
natural cushion, dispersing the impact energy up through the arm.
<p>
<I><A NAME="If you attempt brick breaking without proper training, you'll end
up with an injured  hand and possibly serious nerve damage!">If you attempt
brick breaking without proper training, you'll end up with an injured hand and
possibly serious nerve damage!</A></I> You must be instructed by an expert in proper 
technique. Proper training protects your hand because regularly striking a striking 
pad or post causes your skin to develop calluses, your muscles to strengthen, and your 
bones to thicken. Extensive training is also necessary to train your brain and muscles 
to bring your hand down just right--exactly as it reaches its full speed and right 
smack in the center, at the brick's weakest point.<br>

Use pretzel sticks as a testing ground to understand better what causes materials to 
break. Eat the leftovers!<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<UL>
<LI>  pretzel sticks of varying thicknesses
<LI>  several pieces of uncooked spaghetti
<LI>  paper cup
<LI>  2 rolls of 50 pennies each, plus 50 loose pennies
<LI>  empty plastic film container or small squeeze bottle with top removed
<LI>  thick string or wire approximately 6 cm (2.5") long
<LI>  craft knife or scissors with points
<LI>  pair of tweezers or chopsticks
<LI>  pencil and piece of paper</UL><p>
<OL>
<LI>  Build a pretzel strength-testing machine. Start by cutting a large hole out of 
the bottom of the paper cup. Set the cup on a table, bottom side up. Rest a pretzel 
stick across the center of the cup. 
<LI>  Now create a weight bucket to hang on the pretzel. Take the empty plastic
container and make two holes approximately  1 cm (0.4") from the top rim and directly 
across from each other. Thread the string or wire through the holes and tie the end at
each hole. You'll want to make sure the bucket will hang on the pretzel without 
touching the table.
<LI>  Start testing: With the bucket hanging on the pretzel stick, begin adding
pennies. See how many pennies the pretzel can hold without breaking. Find the average 
number of pennies one type of pretzel stick can hold. 
<LI>  Gaining momentum: Test to see if it makes a difference if you drop the pennies 
in the bucket or if you place them in gently, using the tweezers or chopsticks. Record 
your results.
<LI>  Breaking point: Test to see if the weakest point of the pretzel is really
at the center. 
<LI>  Length and width test: Try pretzels of various lengths and widths to see
what size and length hold the most and least pennies. 
<LI>  Compare with other materials: Do you think a pretzel or an uncooked piece
of spaghetti is stronger when bent? Try testing uncooked spaghetti to see how it holds 
up in comparison to the pretzel sticks.</OL><p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="karate.gif"><p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<OL>
<LI>  Look at the ends of a broken pretzel with a magnifying glass. Does its
structure tell you anything about its bending strength?  
<LI>  What foods break by stretching but not by bending? What foods crush
easily that would be hard to break apart? Do you think bending, crushing, and 
stretching involve different forces? 
<LI>  Can you figure out a way to spread weight out across the entire length of
the pretzel? Can it hold more weight when the weight is distributed over a larger
area?</OL><p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
If you have a friend who studies karate, ask that person to explain to you what the 
classes are like. How much repetitive training is involved? Does the sensei 
(instructor) expect the students to practice often on their own? Call a local karate 
or other martial arts school and ask if you can observe a class. Can you see how 
karate practice trains both mind and body?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Think of some skill that has taken you a long time to learn. How did you learn it? 
Were you training your mind or your body or both? Do you still need to practice it to 
keep up your skill? Write down your answers and compare results with those of your 
classmates. Which types of skills require frequent practice?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Karate practitioners develop thickened skin, or calluses, on their hands from 
practicing strikes on pads and straw-covered posts called makiwara. Notice which 
areas on your body have calluses. Do you know how you got them? Figure out what 
purpose they serve at each spot.<hr>

No other animal captures the image of strength and
majesty like the lion. Thousands of years ago, these powerful <A HREF="#four">felines</A> were found
from the Mediterranean to India. Today the &quot;king of beasts&quot; is largely
restricted to Africa, south of the Sahara desert, where some live in the
woodlands and <A HREF="#six">savannas</A> of protected reserves. <p>Like all cats, the lion is a
muscular hunting machine. Unlike the cheetah, the lion is built for strength, not
speed. A male lion often weighs between 160 and 180 kilograms (350 to 400 pounds)
and is 3 meters (10 feet) long, including the tail. The female lion weighs about
150 kilograms (330 pounds). The shoulder and forelegs are well developed,
enabling lions to clutch prey and pull it to the ground. If its prey is small,
the lion may bite through the skull or neck with its powerful jaws. Larger
animals (like the zebra or wildebeest-the lion's preferred prey) are usually
strangled with a throat bite. Of its 30 teeth, the four <A HREF="#one">canine</A> teeth are used to
hold and puncture, while the four <A HREF="#two">carnassial</A> teeth cut through tough skin and
meat. With no teeth for chewing, this carnivore swallows its food in chunks,
eating about 7 kilograms (15 pounds) of flesh a day.<p>Lions live in <A HREF="#five">prides</A>,
often consisting of four to twelve adult females, their cubs, and one to six
adult males. The lionesses are usually related to each other and stay together
for their lifetimes. They are the main hunters of the pride. The males leave the
pride when they grow up and are replaced by newcomers, sometimes in deadly
fights.<p>Lions are <A HREF="#seven">territorial</A>. The size of the territory is largely determined
by the number of pride members and the amount of prey. It is the male's role to
roar and mark its territory by urinating. The roar is often heard at dawn or dusk
as a warning to intruders. It is produced by the vibration of <A HREF="#three">cartilage</A> in the
back of the lion's throat, and the frightening sound may carry five miles (eight
kilometers).<p>Tracts of land, such as Kenya's Maasai Mara Game Reserve and the
Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, have been set aside to protect lions and
other wild animals. But as the human population grows, there will be more
pressure to turn parkland into farmland. And now lions face an additional threat.
Many suffer from distemper, a viral disease which causes anemia, blindness,
seizures, muscle spasms, and even death. Veterinarians from around the world are
trying to isolate the virus and discover how the animals are exposed to it. <P>

<font size=+5>Cat's Eyes</font>
<br>
Shine some light on why
cats see so well in the dark.
<br>
</center>

<BR> <p>


Like all cats, lions have excellent eyesight and
see almost as well at night as during the day. The feline's pupils have evolved
to quickly adjust to the amount of light needed for the hunt. A cat's pupils can
open wide to allow in the faintest moonlight. The same pupil can close to the
size of a pinhole during the day to shade out bright rays. Felines need only
one-sixth the light humans do to make out the same details of movement and shape.
When you compare your eyes to a cat's eyes, you will be learning about a lion's
eyes, too.<p>

<img align=left hspace-5 src="illustrations/linvet.gif">
<b>Materials</b><BR> 
<ul>
<li>naturalist's notebook and pencil<BR>
<li>flashlight<BR>
<li>cat <BR> 
<li>mirror (optional)<BR> 
</ul>
1.  In a brightly lit room,
study a partner's eyes or look at your own eyes in a mirror. Sketch them, noting
the size of the pupils in relation to the iris.<BR> 
2.  Now dim the lights for
five minutes. Sketch your partner's eyes or your eyes. Again, draw the size of
the pupils in relation to the iris. Compare the two sketches.<BR> 
3.  Next,
observe a cat under the same conditions. Draw what the cat's eyes look like when
the room is brightly lit. Sketch the cat's eyes when the room is dimly lit. In a
nearly dark room, shine a flashlight at the cat until you can see its eyes
glow.<p>

<b>Questions</b><BR> 

1.  What are the differences in the pupil size of a
human's eyes in various amounts of light? Why do the pupils change size? Can you
explain the difference between human eyes and those of the cat?<BR> 
2.  Why do a
cat's eyes glow in the dark? (Hint: Research the term tapetum lucidum.)<BR> 
3.  A
cat's pupils dilate at dusk to hunt, but why do they dilate in a flight-or-fight
situation?<p>

<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif"></a>
<br clear=left> 

With a friend, observe and record the activities of a
cat every 15 minutes over a period of several hours. For each 15-minute segment,
write down the primary activity of the cat. What proportion of the cat's time is
spent eating, drinking, playing, exploring, or just plain sleeping? How does a
cat's routine compare to that of a lion? How does it compare to yours?<p>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left><BR> Research as much as you can about lions. Then invite a local
veterinarian to visit your class and share information about cats, their
anatomical structures, common diseases, behaviors, etc. Find out what pet cats
and lions have in common. What are their differences? For example, can a cat roar
or a lion purr?<p>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left><BR> With a friend, write down as many members of the
cat family as you can, listing them by continent. Try to find pictures of them.
Make your own field guide of cats by doing research on each one. Page through a
field guide first to find out the consistent characteristics to research, such as
appearance, habitat, range, and food.<p>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left><BR> Observe a cat. How many
claws does a cat have? How do the back feet differ from the front feet? How many
whiskers does a cat have? Can you find the backward barbs on a cat's tongue?
These are used for grooming and scraping meat off bones. Can you tell the canine
teeth from the carnassial?<P>

How big is an average chemical factory? How big is a chemical factory that not
only produces new chemicals, but also recycles old ones and turns them into more
new chemicals? What if this factory also regulates other factories down the road
and stores spare parts? <p>We're obviously talking about a very big and quite
complex factory. Yet the tiny hepatic cell of the liver handles all these tasks
and more, occupying a space so small that several hundred cells could fit on the
head of a pin!<p>Located on your right side under the lower rib cage, the liver
is actually the biggest <A HREF="#five">gland</A> in your body. It weighs about 1,600 grams (3.5
pounds) and contains millions of cells. Every single cell is its own complete
factory, performing every job that needs to be done. <p>Here is a partial list
of what one of these amazing cells can do:
<BR><ul>   
<li>Make <A HREF="#two">bile</A> and send it down the
bile <A HREF="#three">duct</A>. Bile is important for dissolving fats in the digestive tract.<BR> 
<li>Collect <A HREF="#eight">nutrients</A> from the <A HREF="#nine">portal vein</A>.<BR>
<li>Synthesize important proteins for
the blood, such as albumin, which is essential to the blood-clotting process.<BR>
<li>Convert extra <A HREF="#six">glucose</A>, the body's primary source of stored energy, into
<A HREF="#seven">glycogen</A>.<BR>
<li>Clean <A HREF="#ten">toxins</A> from the blood.  
</ul>
<BR>
 
Because of all this activity, the liver needs to be well-connected to the rest of the 
body. Two highways go into the liver: The portal <A HREF="#eleven">vein</A>, which carries nutrient-laden 
blood from the stomach and intestines, and the hepatic <A HREF="#one">artery</A>, which carries 
oxygen-rich blood from the heart and lungs. Two different kinds of highways lead out 
from the liver: The hepatic veins, which drain the blood from the liver, and the bile
ducts, which take bile from the liver cells to the <A HREF="#four">gall bladder</A>. Every single
cell is in close contact with all four of these highways. To get to each cell,
each highway must divide into smaller and smaller branches. <p>The liver is
truly a marvelous example of natural engineering. Next time you hear someone talk
about recycling or chemical manufacturing, think about the recycling and
manufacturing plant in your own body - the liver. 

<p>

1.  Alcohol abuse can cause serious damage to the liver. Illicit drugs in the 
bloodstream can create other liver problems. Why might the liver be especially 
sensitive to the presence of drugs in the bloodstream? <BR> 
2.  Do you see any advantage in the liver's location? 
Could you find a better location? <BR>

<font size=+5>Breaking Up Is Easy to Do</font>
<br>
Mix detergent, oil, and water to show how bile breaks down fat.<br>
</center>
<BR>
<p>
 
The gut uses bile to physically break down fatty substances into smaller pieces. In
this way, enzymes can more easily turn the fat chemically into fatty acids, which
the small intestine can absorb for body needs. Simple dish detergents act on oils
in a manner similar to the way that bile acts on fat. In the following activity,
you will get a chance to see this process in action.
<p>Materials<BR> 
<ul>
	<li> 2 see-through glass or plastic cups, 240 ml (8 oz) in size <BR> 
	<li>dish detergent (for hand dish-washing)<BR> 
	<li>small amount of vegetable oil<BR> 
	<li>water<BR> 
	<li>2 stirring rods or spoons<p>

</ul>	
1.  Pour about 120 ml (4 oz) of water into each cup.<BR> 
2.  Slowly and gently pour a small amount of vegetable oil into each cup. Pour enough so that there is a layer of about one
or two centimeters of oil on top of the water. The exact amount is not crucial,
but try to pour so that both cups contain about the same amount.<BR> 
3.  Take some time out to examine the way that the oil reacts with the water. Does the oil
stay together as you pour it in? What happens to the oil if you wait two or three
minutes?<BR> 
4.  After the oil has collected itself together (approximately five minutes), add a small amount (about seven drops) of the detergent to one of the
cups.<BR> 
5.  Gently but quickly stir both of the cups with the stirring rods or
spoons. Be careful to keep each stirring device in its own cup. Stir for about 15
seconds.<BR> 
6.  Observe what happens during the first five minutes after the cups have been stirred. Examine the contents in a bright light. <BR> 7.  If you
can, come back an hour later to observe any further changes in the cups.
<P>

<img align=right hspace-5 src="illustrations/liver.gif">

Questions<BR> 
1.  How did the oil behave in the water before any detergent was added? What effect did the detergent have on the oil after the cups were
stirred?<BR> 
2.  What possible benefit is there in breaking up fats physically
into smaller pieces before any kind of chemical breakdown occurs, which changes
the fat into its simpler components?<BR> 
3.  What use are detergents in washing dishes? Why do they make washing easier?

<h1>Locks and Dams</h1>
How does a lock and dam make an unnavigable part of a waterway navigable?<br>
<hr>
</center>
Peggy finds out how the flow of the mighty Mississippi can be altered with the
push of a button.<br>
Segment length:  8:00
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Much of our folklore has explored the possibility of "escaping" on the river.
Before the advent of the car, many a youth dreamed of traveling cross-country
by water.  Today there are 25,500 miles of navigable inland waterways in the
United States; the Mississippi River, featured in the segment, accounts for
approximately 9,000 miles of this system.
<p>
Equally appealing to youth is building a pint-size version of a dam by piling
up sticks and debris to alter the flow of rainwater that is running down
street-side curbs toward sewer drains.  Dams are fascinating and useful; ruins
of the world's oldest dam in Egypt along the Nile date to 2,700 B.C.  (It was
37 feet high and 348 feet long.)  More recently, the United States has built
more than 5,000 dams, Japan has built about 2,000, and India has more than
1,000.
<p>
Universally, humans need water, but nature delivers water in imperfect amounts
due to climate and weather.  (Humans also contribute to problems of water
availability; for example, deforestation can create desert-like climates in
places where water was once abundant.)  Some areas have too much water, some
not enough, and some have both conditions at different times.  Because of this
irregularity, dams can be built to make water supplies more useful.  Dams have
many functions:  diversion dams control the supply of water to prevent floods;
storage dams reserve water for use during dry periods; power dams generate
electricity; and navigation dams provide navigable waters.
<p>
Some river areas may be unnavigable by commercial boats and barges because of
shoals, rapids, waterfalls, or low water.  The riverbed itself may change in
elevation, which may prohibit reliable and economical navigation.  Finally,
some rivers have been dammed.  A <a href="#two">lock</a> can help make navigation possible in each
of these situations.
<p>
The technology of locks looks complex, but the principle is simple:  The river
is an inclined plane whose water moves in and out of locks by <a href="#one">gravity</a>.  Think
of locks as a flight of "water stairs" going up and down a hill.  Water is
drained from the first lock (using gravity) until the water level is even with the
second one.  The downstream gate is opened to allow the vessel into the lower
lock, and the process is repeated.  The lifting and lowering of vessels, some
weighing up to 60 tons, is done without a great use of energy.

 Main Activity</h4></a>
<p>
<center>
<h1>Under Pressure</h1>
<a href="#three">Pascal's law</a> is demonstrated in this water-pressure 
demonstration.
</center>
<p>
A cubic foot of fresh water weighs 62.4 pounds.  Water weighs more than a heavy
wood such as oak, but half as much as bricks.  The point is, of course, that as
the elevation of water behind a dam is increased, the height and density of it
causes high pressure at the bottom of the dam.  In this activity, you will
observe what happens to the flow of water when it is under pressure.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>2 tall empty juice cans <br>
<li>nails<br>
<li>adhesive tape<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Punch three holes horizontally at the bottom of one can, about 1/2" to 3/4"
apart.  Cover the holes with adhesive tape.  Ask your students to predict what
will happen when you fill the can with water and remove the tape:  Will any of
the streams be longer than the others?  <p>
<li>Punch three holes diagonally in the side of another can.  Cover the holes
with adhesive tape.  Ask your students to predict what will happen when you
fill the can with water and remove the tape:  Will any of the streams be longer
than the others?<p>
<li>Fill both cans with water, and then tear off the tape on the can with the
horizontal holes.  Observe what happens.  <p>
<li>Now, remove the tape from the can with the diagonal holes.  Observe what
happens. <p>
</ol>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  What happened when the tape was removed from the can with the horizontal
holes?  (All the streams are the same length because, according to Pascal's
law, water pressure at a given depth is the same in every direction.)<p>
2.  What happened when the tape was removed from the can with the diagonal
holes?  (The longest stream of water shoots from the bottom hole because the
deeper the water, the greater the pressure.)<p>
3.  Would this same principle of water pressure work with a balloon?  Try it!<p>
4.  What household devices or appliances use the principle of water pressure to
function?

<center><h1>LUGE</h1>
<i>How do engineering and technology play a role in the Olympics?</i></center><p><hr>

Peggy learns how gravity, friction and wind resistance all play a role in the sport of luge.<p>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to take a ride on the luge?  
<li>Why would athletes want to analyze their movements?  
<li>How important is the start of the race?  
<li>What kind and amount of strength does running a luge require?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
The Olympic luge event was introduced in 1964 at Innsbruck-Igis, Austria.  The word luge  is French for "racing sled." 
Lugers careen down the course feet first while lying on their backs.  The luge sled was originally controlled by a 
hand-held strap which guided the front of the runner.  Now luges are steered by the lugers exerting pressure on the 
sides of the car with their feet and shoulders.<p>  

Sliders have limited visibility because of their body position combined with speeds of up to 80 miles per hour.  
Hairpin turns in the course and rules requiring one of the four runs to be run at night make this event one of the 
most dangerous in the Olympics.  It is so dangerous, in fact, that in 1964 a Polish-born British slider named 
Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski was killed in a luge accident, and later, two other German lugers were severely injured.<p>  

Several physical forces are demonstrated by a luge event.  One is <A href="#friction">friction</a>, the force that slows down moving objects 
when two surfaces rub together.  Of course, the ice on the luge course minimizes the potential for friction on the 
surface.  Lugers attempt to further reduce the force of friction by using the most slippery materials possible to 
construct the luge itself.  The <A href="#weight">weight</a> of the luger places pressure on the ice, melting it and creating a slippery 
layer of water that further reduces friction.  But there are rules about overcoming friction.  In 1968, the German 
Women's Olympic Team was disqualified for heating the runners on their sleds!<p>

Another physical force involved with luge is gravity.  Gravity causes <A href="#acceleration">acceleration</a> and helps the luge move.  The 
forward motion is balanced by the friction of air pushing against the luge.  Because of this air friction, designers 
must use aerodynamic principles to reduce the wind drag to a bare minimum.  Often they use tight rubberized suits, 
special helmets with rounded face shields or smooth sleds designed with a low center of gravity.<p><hr>
<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>

<li>Oftentimes, lugers are filmed on high speed video that is then converted to computer graphics to analyze performance.  
The use of this technology is a trend in modern sports and in the Olympics.  By knowing more about physics and how it 
affects their performance, athletes can modify their training and practice sessions to improve their performance.  
What would you expect computer analysis to tell you about your favorite sport?</ol>

<b>CONSTRUCT A LUGE</b><p>
You can design your own luge and luge course.  Try and find ways to make your luge car travel faster and then start 
racing!<p>
<B>Main Activity</B><p>
By applying the physical forces of friction, the force that slows objects down when they rub together, and gravity, 
which helps the luge accelerate, you can design super fast luges and exciting luge courses.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/luge.gif" hspace=10>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Graph paper
<li>Card board
<li>Rubber bands
<li>Waxed paper
<li>Butcher paper
<li>Aluminum foil
<li>Several toy cars of different shapes and sizes  (Or, try to make your own luge with popsicle sticks, tongue depressers 
and glue)
<li>Stop watch</ul>
<p>
1.  Have the class discuss what kind of course to build for your cars or luge.  Choose what kinds of variables you want
in your course, like the number of curves, angle of turns, elevation or length of the course.  You may want to add a 
drop hole so the car or luge could drop through to another chute below.<p>
2.  Once your class has chosen a plan, divide into two teams.  One team will design and build the course, the other 
will select the best cars or build a miniature luge.<p>
3.  Once the chute is constructed and the cars are ready, begin timing how long it takes the cars or luges to complete 
the course.  Run several time trials and record your observations.  Graph the results.<p>
4.  Try to modify the cars or luges to make them go faster.  Record and graph the times of these modified trials.<p>
5.  Discuss your modifications, observations, and graphs.  Select one car or luge for the course and invite other 
classes to enter a luge contest.<p>
<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  What effect does a sharp curve have on the speed of your vehicle?<p>
2.  Should a luge course be designed so that the car's speed increases continuously?  Should there be parts of the 
course that level the luge out?  Why or why not?<p>
3.  What factors increase or diminish speed?<p>
4.  Find out what drag means.  Is there drag in water?  What effect might it have on aquatic animals?<p>
5.  What affects your speed when you are sledding?  How could you find ways to go faster?  Could you find better ways 
to control the turns?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Split up into several groups and discuss how friction helps us and how it hinders us in the things we do.  See if you 
can find pictures that illustrate the effects friction has on our daily lives.
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

You can demonstrate the effects of air resistance when it interacts with gravity.  Construct a paper parachute and 
attach it to a large iron washer.  Hold another iron washer in your other hand.  Drop the  parachute with the washer 
and the solitary washer at the same time.  Which washer reaches the floor last?  Why?
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Videotape a friend playing a sport or performing an activity.  Using freeze frame or slow motion, analyze the 
performance in terms of physical forces like gravity, friction and drag.  Help your friend improve his/her performance.
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Sports like tobogganing and bobsledding are similar to the luge.  Split the class into teams and have them investigate 
the similarities and the differences between each sport.  Pay particular attention to how each sport allows for 
physical forces like gravity, friction and air resistance.  Go sledding if there is snow in your area.  Each team 
should prepare a report to present to the class.<p><p>

<p>
Beware the Minotaur! This fearsome mythical creature, half man and half bull, lurked in the dark corners of the Cretan labyrinth, waiting to devour young people sent by King Minos. But Theseus conquered the Minotaur and, guided by a golden thread, emerged from the labyrinth a victor!
<P>
Like the legend of the Minotaur, <i><a href="#maze">mazes</i></a> and labyrinths have long fascinated us. Ancient civilizations left stories of enormous labyrinthian buildings with up to 3,000 rooms. Hedge mazes have decorated gardens for centuries, providing entertainment and secret meeting places. Psychologists use mazes to study how animals learn.
<P> 
What is the difference between a maze and a labyrinth? Actually, the two names are synonymous. However, maze is used more often, perhaps because of the popular hedge mazes. Labyrinthian describes something that has maze-like qualities-your thumbprint or a house with many rooms to wander through.
<P>
What should you do if you become lost in a maze? That depends on the maze. A unicursal maze has only one path to follow, and while it may feel like you are getting lost as you twist and turn, you will eventually reach the goal. A  multicursal maze has branches and forks that require you to guess the best path. If lost, you apply the "right-hand rule"-keep your right hand against the maze wall as you walk. You are guaranteed an outalthough it may be the entrance instead of the exit!
<P>
With a diagram of a maze, you can apply <i><a href="#topology">topology</a></i>, a branch of mathematics created by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) as he solved the Konigsberg bridge problem (see illustration on back). Located on the Preger River, Konigsberg contained two islands connected by seven bridges. The citizens wanted to know if they could walk through their city while crossing each bridge only once. 
<P>
Euler drew a diagram-or <i><a href="#network">network</a></i>-of the problem and, as a topologist, studied the <i><a href="#arc">arcs</a></i> and <i>vertices</i>. He discovered that  for a network to be <i><a href="#traceable">traceable</a></i>, it can only have two odd vertices. A vertex is considered odd or even depending on the number of arcs that intersect it. In the Konigsberg network, there are four odd vertices, making it impossible to cross each bridge only once. By examining arcs and vertices, you can determine the most efficient path through your maze. 
<P>
Networks are commonplace in our world-from electricity and phone lines to computer systems and computers themselves. When you think about it, the impact that labyrinths and their study have on our lives is truly "a-maze-ing"!

<center><h1>MEDICAL QUAKERIES</h1>
<i>Can this machine cure me?</i></center><p><hr>

David explores numerous medical quackery  gadgets.<p>
<ul>
<li>Have medical quackeries always been around?  
<li>How can a consumer know if they are buying a good product?  
<li>What do doctors think about these "treatments"?  
<li>Can these products cause harm?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
The word <A href="#quack">quackery </a>usually brings to mind old-time
fast-talking medicine peddlers who conned their listeners into 
buying cure-all bottled syrup.  It reminds people of flowery and curious
advertisements promising miracles like 
"Certain cure for all contagious diseases without drugging the system!"  But as
Abraham Lincoln said, "It is true that 
you may fool all of the people some of the time, you can even fool some of the
people all of the time, but you can't 
fool all people all of the time."<p>

Have these <A href="#altertr">alternative treatments </a>gone the way of
horse-drawn wagons, put out to pasture by medical advances and the 
regulations of the government?  Most medical and advertising experts say no.  In
fact, today's medical quacks, 
fraudulently earning millions of dollars, would be the envy of early
practitioners.  As fast as medical research 
debunks the quack claims, con artists invent profitable new packaging that simply
draw on the latest words in medicine,
like electronic and hormonal, or with references to new discoveries of wonder
drugs.  There is also an explosion of 
less threatening, yet still fraudulent, methods of self-medication from diet and
cold remedies to hair restorers and 
wrinkle removers.<p>

Quack medicine refers to any worthless treatments while medical <A
href="#fraud">fraud </a>implies an intent to deceive the consumer.  False
or misleading health claims for a food, drug, device or cosmetic are all forms of
medical quackery.  These products 
use human hope, fears and ignorance to make a profit.  Only critical examination
and careful consideration by consumers
can limit the success of practitioners of these quack alternative therapies.<p>

<hr>
<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>Have you ever bought something only to find it doesn't live up to its
advertised claims?  How did you feel when 
you realized you had been taken?  
<li>How should producers of medical quackeries be punished for misleading
people?</ol>

<h1><center><B>Activity Page</B></center></h1>

<B>Reading Between the Lines</B><p>
Discover ways you can evaluate the medical products and treatments you see
advertised on TV and radio and in magazines 
and catalogs.<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
Some promoters sincerely believe in their quack products while others
deliberately deceive consumers for profit or fame.
Learn how to protect yourself and your family from these worthless products.<p>  

Materials:<ul>
<li>Tabloid newspapers
<li>Magazines
<li>Mail order medicine catalogs
<li>Natural health magazines
<li>Health-related mail offers</ul>
<p>
1.  Look through the materials you have collected.  Pay particular attention to
ads for aspirins, cold remedies, 
vitamins, weight-loss and weight-gain products, hair restorers and cosmetics.<p>
2.  Create a check list of questions to use in evaluating each advertised
product.  Try to determine if each claim 
about the product or treatment is believable or if it sounds suspicious.  Does
the advertisement contain words like 
secret, revolutionary, ancient, overnight, miracle or breakthrough?  Has the
promoter promised never to reveal the 
secret of their product?  Does the advertisement claim there is a conspiracy
among doctors to keep the product off the 
market?  Does the advertisement claim that it can cure a long list of problems
with no side effects?  Does the promoter 
claim to be the only person who can help?<p>
3.  Make a list of all the suspicious claims you find.  Analyze each statement to
see if there are any real facts in it.
Describe what you think makes the product sound legitimate and what makes it
appear misleading.<p>
4.  See if you can find several different types of products or treatments.  Post
your advertisements and analyses in 
the classroom.  Compare yours with your classmates'.<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  What kinds of problems can quack medical products and treatments create? 
Could they delay someone from seeking 
legitimate medical help?<p>
2.  Look at a few advertisements for legitimate medicines.  Do these ads use any
of the same selling techniques?  What 
are the best ways to tell which are real medicines and quack ones?<p>
3.  Some medical quacks have legitimate credentials and others have
self-proclaimed or mail order education degrees.  
How could you investigate someone's credentials?  If you found them to be
illegitimate, what would you do?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Contact your local consumer protection agency and ask if any quack remedies or
devices are popular in your area.  
Survey your friends and families to see if any of the products they use are
actually quack remedies.  Where do they 
find these products?  Do they know they may not be legitimate medical treatments?
 If so, why do they keep using them?
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Sometimes medical quackery seems to work by relying on the placebo effect.  Gain
a better understanding of how this 
effect works.  Which of the following would you call placebos:  a pill made of
sugar; penicillin to cure pneumonia; 
chicken soup; a warm bath; and a Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtle bandage.  Can you
find other examples of placebos?  
<p>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

The next time you have the hiccups, try some of these folk cures.  Place your two
little fingers in your ears and hold 
your breath.  Or, hold both of your ears tightly closed and have someone else
give you a drink of water.  You also 
could try wearing some nutmeg around your neck.  Have you heard of other ways
that you can cure the hiccups?  Make a 
list of folk medicine cures for other common ailments like warts, baldness and
nosebleeds.  Can you find information 
on the origins of these folk techniques?<p><p>

<p>
<A HREF="#memory"><i>Memory </i></A>is such a complicated process that no universally accepted theory exists
to explain how it works. Scientists don't even agree on where individual memories
are stored.
<p>
However, they do agree on some general information about memory. The brain's
cerebral cortex receives nerve messages from eyes, ears, and touch sensors. This
sensory stimulus is held for a fraction of a second in the sensory memory. Unless
an individual pays attention to the image for about eight uninterrupted seconds
to encode the stimulus into short-term memory, it will be lost. The slightest
interference at this stage can displace newly acquired information from our
consciousness.
<p>
<A HREF="#short"><i>Short-term memory</i></A> (STM) is the brain's system for remembering information "in
use." But as indicated above, STM doesn't reliably hold on to information. It
also has limited storage capacity--seven items, plus or minus two. If STM tries to
acquire more items than it can handle, the middle items will often be displaced.
Storage seems to increase if we pronounce the names of the items out
loud--especially if they are grouped rhythmically. Grouping items into threes or
fours also seems to aid recall.
<p><dl>
<A HREF="#chunk"><i>Chunking</i></A> also expands STM. A "chunk" is a unit of information that corresponds to
some familiar pattern. Try reading this sequence and then recall it:
<dd> i g d b f d n o n u c a <p>
<dt>Next, try the same exercise on these letters:
 <dd>c o u n f b a d d i n g<p>
<dt>Chunking it into a word you can pronounce made the difference.
<p>
<dt>Try the same process with this list of numbers:
 <dd>2 8 3 4 9 6<p>
<dt>Next, try remembering this:
 <dd>28 34 96 </dl>
Instead of six numbers, you only need to recall three.
<p>
To understand its function in the brain, think of STM as a circular tape loop.
Once a complete loop is made, three things can happen: (1) the information can be
"rehearsed" (repeated) silently or aloud, which will provide auditory cues; (2)
the information goes into <A HREF="#long"><i>long-term memory</i></A> (LTM); or (3) the information will be lost.
<p>
Certain foods, aerobic exercise, and stress reduction can improve STM. On the
other hand, marijuana users experience subtle STM deficits that continue for at
least six weeks after their last usage. Stress or accidental trauma to the head
can also affect STM.
<p>
The trick to improving memory is to plant information in STM and then transfer it
into LTM. Many books, classes, and tapes offer suggestions for training STM. If
you could just remember where you left that flyer...

<h1><b>DON'T FORGET TO REMEMBER!</b></h1> 
<b>Apply your observation skills in this test of memory.</b>
<p>
<h2><b><A NAME="main">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2></b>
<p>
Memory depends so much on observation. This activity will exercise both memory
and observation skills!
<p>
<img align=right src="Images/1103M.gif" hspace=10>
<b>Materials</b> 
<ul>
<li> As many age-appropriate clothing accessories as you can gather.
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Divide into two groups ("A" and "B"). Each person will then pair with a member
from the other group.
<p>
<li> "A"  group members will take two to three minutes to observe "B" group members
carefully, noting all their accessories and how they are dressed.
<p>
<li> After "A" members seem sure they know what "B" members are wearing, "B"
members will go into an area where they can't be seen by "A" members.
<p>
<li> "B" members will change five things about their clothing, including trading
accessories with other "B" members and using the additional accessories provided.
For example, transfer a watch to the other hand. Untie a shoelace. Remove or add
a belt.
<p>
<li> Return to the original observation place. Does the "A" member of the pair
remember what the "B" member originally was wearing and notice all the changes?
<p>
<li> Switch roles.
<p>
<li> Try this activity again, but allow several hours to elapse between the
original observation and the second observation after the change.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b> 
<ol>
<li> Was there a difference in what observers noticed? Did minor changes
go unnoticed and major changes stand out? 
<li> How can understanding this attention
to detail help you in your other school work, such as writing?
</ol>

<p>
<hr>
<b><A NAME="try"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></A></b><p> Your local library probably has several books on improving memory.
Some common techniques include using rhymes, acronyms, acrostics, repetition,
linking, story creation, or creation of bizarre or unusual mental pictures.
Research a particular mnemonic system. Find some material to remember and devise
a mnemonic device for the list.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Memory is a function, but it is also a skill you can develop. Natural
mnemonic devices can help you do that. Research some popular mnemonic devices,
such as these two phrases for remembering the colors of the rainbow (red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet):  "Roy G. Biv" or "Richard of York Gains
Battles in Vain."
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> 7 +/- 2--the magic memory number! The human mind can remember seven
(give or take 2) "chunks" of information, whether single digits or pieces of
data. Pair up with a partner. Create a list of ten grocery items and read them
slowly to your partner. How many can your partner remember? Take turns with
different lists and record the results on a graph. Try your experiment with
different age groups.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> We often learn skills slowly, by repetition, until they become a
habit. "Unlearning" habits can be hard, as this exercise will show. In a group,
have one person dictate a paragraph of very short sentences as fast as possible.
The rest of the group should write down the sentences as fast as they can,
without using capital letters or periods. Were the writers able to break the
habit of punctuating? Try this experiment on young people and on adults. Do you
notice a difference in their ability to break these habits?

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
Most of us see <A HREF="#meteor"><i>meteors</i></A> by chance. You're out with a friend on a dark
night, and suddenly you see a bright object streak across the sky. You
shout, "Look at the <A HREF="#shooting"><i>shooting star</i></A>," but by the time your friend looks,
it's gone. If you're lucky, you see it together.
<p>
But can you <i>try</i> to see a meteor? You bet. Simply go out at night and
watch and wait. Lie on your back, and look up at the sky. If you don't
get too cold and you don't fall asleep, you'll probably see about five
meteors an hour, though you can't predict exactly where or when they'll
appear. These <A HREF="#sporadic"><i>sporadic meteors</i></A> are just chance collisions between a bit
of space dirt and Earth's atmosphere.
<p>
A typical meteor has a mass that is only a fraction of a gram. When it
hits the atmosphere, it is probably going 10-40 kilometers per second
(20,000-90,000 miles per hour). When it enters Earth's atmosphere, its
surface heats up because of friction. Bits of matter fall away, and
atoms evaporate from the surface to form a hot, gaseous envelope around
the tiny particle. This hot envelope, which may be a foot or more in
diameter, hurtles through the atmosphere, making a streak of light in
the sky. The meteor usually burns up in the atmosphere--and the envelope
dissipates--by the time it's within 60 kilometers (200,000 feet) off the
ground.
<p>
If you're really lucky, you'll see a much larger meteor. The bigger the
piece of dirt, the longer and brighter the streak in the sky. Fewer than
one in a thousand visible meteors are fireballs or <A HREF="#bolide"><i>bolides</i></A>, which are
especially bright and can make explosive or hissing noises.
<p>
If the meteor slows down enough, it will stop evaporating before it has
been completely obliterated. These <A HREF="#meteorite"><i>meteorites</i></A> actually will fall to the
ground.
<p>
If you don't like waiting around for a chance encounter with a sporadic
meteor, you should go out on a night when astronomers are expecting a
<A HREF="#showers"><i>meteor shower</i></A>. Several times a year, Earth passes
through a known cloud of space dirt, usually debris from a comet. In these clouds, the
<A HREF="#meteoroid"><i>meteoroids</i></A>--the bits of matter in space--are about 50 kilometers (30
miles) apart.
<p>
Because meteor showers occur as Earth moves through a particular region
of space, they happen at the same time every year. Here are a few of the
most reliable meteor shower dates:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Quadrantids	January 1-3 
<li>Perseids	August 11 
<li>Orionids	October 20
<li>Geminids	December 13

<b><h1>CRATER CREATION</h1></b>
<b>Find out what the size of a crater can tell us about the meteorite
that made it.</b><pre>
</pre>
<h2><b><A NAME="MAIN">Main Activity</a></h2></b>
<p>

Make craters like David did in the Newton's Apple segment. Measure what
factors make a difference in how big a crater is.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><ul> 
<li> a sandbox (the finer the sand, the better) 
<li> various objects: a marble, a large ball bearing, rocks of different sizes 
<li> a ruler 
<li> paper and pencil for recording data 
<li> a scale, such as a kitchen scale, for weighing the objects (optional) 
<li> a ladder (optional)</ul>
<ol>
<li> Make a recording sheet with two columns--one for recording
information about your "meteorite" and another for information about the
craters it produces.
<li> Prepare a smooth, flat surface in the sandbox at least 30 cm (1') on
a side. Be sure the sand is loose and dry beneath it.
<li> Pick an object to act as your meteorite. Measure and record its
length and, if you have a scale, weigh your meteorite and record that
figure, too.
<li> Make sure no one is in the way!
<li> Throw the meteor down into the middle of the sand as hard and as fast
as you can.
<li> Look at the crater you made. Measure its diameter (to the nearest
millimeter, if you can) and its depth.
<li> Repeat steps 4 through 6 at least two more times to get three or more
measurements from your meteorite.
<li> Repeat steps 3 through 7 using different objects as meteorites.
<li> (Optional)  Repeat the steps, substituting flour for sand and
dropping the objects instead of throwing them. This will remove the
added variable of velocity. Observe how your results differ when you
drop the object into flour instead of throwing it into sand.
</ol>
<b>Questions</b><ol> 
<li>What problems did you encounter as you tried to measure the
craters? How did you deal with those problems? 
<li>How did your craters vary? Did the same meteor always produce a crater of the same size? How
did changing the meteor change the crater you made? Did you see any
patterns? 
<li>How could you change this investigation? Can you think of
other materials that would make good craters? Can you think of other
things you might measure? 
<li>How does making craters in a sandbox helps
us understand real meteorite craters? 
<li>Based on the final pattern, can
you tell which craters were made first? How can astronomers estimate the
age of meteor craters on other planets?</ol>

<A NAME="TRY"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></a><p> 
Go out with a friend to a dark place at night--during a
meteor shower if you can--and try to see some meteors. Bring a
flashlight so you can find your way safely. While you watch, see if you
can identify the path the meteors take.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Get a topographic map of Meteor Crater, Arizona. How do they
indicate the depression on the map? Find where Meteor Crater is on a map
of the United States. Using the topographic map, make a model of Meteor
Crater with clay or plaster of paris.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Thousands of meteorites fall on our planet each year. They
are small and usually harmless. Read "The Science of Doom" in Newsweek
(Nov 23, 1992) to learn about the probability of a much larger meteorite
making contact with Earth. When was our last "big hit"? Stage a debate
regarding the use of tactics to divert an approaching meteor.

MICROWAVE OVENS</h1>
<i>What is the science behind microwave cooking?</i></center><p><hr>

      <p>

<UL> <LI>How does a microwave oven cook food? <LI> Why doesn't the oven get hot? <LI> How does special packaging speed up the cooking times? <LI> Why shouldn't you put metal objects in a microwave oven?
</UL>
<hr><center><B>Discussion</B></center><p>
Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic energy, like light waves or radio waves, and occupy a part of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Microwaves are used to relay long-distance telephone signals, television programs and computer information across the earth or to a satellite in space.  They are even used for a type of medical treatment called diathermy.<p>

The microwave is most familiar as the energy source for cooking food.  Every microwave oven contains a magnetron, which generates microwaves at just the right frequency to interact with the molecules in food and heat it directly.<p>
All wave energy changes polarity from positive to negative with each cycle of the wave.  In microwaves, these polarity changes happen millions of times every second.  Food <A href="#molecules">molecules</a> - especially the molecules of water - have a positive and negative end, in the same way a bar magnet has a north and a south pole.  When microwaves at the right frequency bombard food, they cause the polar molecules to rotate at the same frequency, millions of times a second.  All this agitation on the molecular level creates friction, which heats up the food.  Because microwaves don't interact with molecules of glass, plastic or paper, only the food is heated.  <p>

Metal containers can produce dangerous arcing in a microwave oven.  However, many food packages actually contain thin films of metal that speed the cooking process.  For example, new packaging techniques use metalized polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film laminated to paperboard as a heat <A href="#susceptor">susceptor</a>.  This surface absorbs microwaves, and becomes a miniature "frying pan" to brown or fry the foods in the package.
<p>
<hr><h3><center><B>Things to Talk About</B></h3></center><p>
<ol>
<li>  Have you eaten microwaved food in the last 24 hours?  Listened to the radio?  Made a long distance telephone call?  What do all these activities have in common?
<li> Why might you want to rotate foods cooking in a microwave oven?  What foods would cook best in a micro-wave?  What foods might not cook well at all?  What kinds of containers would you not want to use in a microwave?  Why?
<li>  How long are microwaves?  How long are light waves?  Radio waves?</ol><p><hr>

<B>Cooking By the Numbers!</B><p>
See the differences in how microwave ovens and conventional ovens heat different substances.<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
Although both microwaves and conventional ovens ultimately use thermal energy to cook food, the molecules in the food respond differently when exposed to an energy source.<p>

Materials<p> 
<ul>
<LI>Microwave oven
<LI>Conventional oven
<LI>500 milliliters of water
<LI>500 milliliters of sterile sand
<LI>Two microwaveable containers
<LI>Two oven-safe containers
<LI>Thermometer
*Use safety measures with the ovens.</ul><p>
1.    Pour 250 milliliters of water into one of the microwaveable containers.  Measure and record the temperature of the water.
2.    Pour 250 milliliters of sand into a similar container.  Measure and record the temperature of the sand.
3.    Place the container of water in the microwave oven and run the oven at its highest power setting for two minutes.  Remove the container of water.  Measure and record  the new water temperature.
4.    Place the container of sand in the microwave oven and run the oven at its highest power setting for two minutes.  Remove the container of sand.  Measure and record the new temperature of the sand. 
5.    Preheat the conventional oven to about 100 degrees Celsius or 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
6.    Pour 250 milliliters water into one of the oven-safe containers.  Measure and record the temperature of the water.  Make sure that the temperature of this water is the same temperature that you recorded for the water that you put in the microwave oven.
7.    Pour 250 milliliters of sand into one of the conventional oven containers.  Measure and record the temperature of the sand.  The sand, too, should be the same temperature as the sand used in the microwave oven.
8.    Place both containers in the preheated oven.   Heat the two pans for about 10 minutes.  Remove both containers from the oven.  Quickly measure and record the temperature of both the water and the sand.  
9.    Develop a table that lists your results.<p>

<B>Questions</b><p>
1.    What was the temperature change of the  water and the temperature change of the sand in each oven?  Which material had the greatest increase in temperature for each type of oven?  Why do you think these results happened? 
2.    How would your results change if the water was left in the conventional longer?  Try it!
3.    What kinds of food cook best in a microwave oven?  In a conventional oven?  What are you basing your choices on?</ol>
<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Many terms are used in describing electromagnetic waves.  Investigate the following terms:  wavelength, amplitude, cycle and frequency. How can these terms be used when describing a stone dropped into a tray of water?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Different waves affect the human body.  Ask your school nurse about waves used in the study of human physiology.  Invite a radiologist to your class.  Ask him/her about brain waves and X-rays.  Investigate biorhythms.  How are they measured?<p> 

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Purchase several microwaveable products and dismantle the packaging.  Compare the packages.  How have theories of energy absorption been combined with cooking?  Do any packages look like they might release adhesives into the product at high temperatures?  Do any use heat susceptors?<p><p>

You've heard the expression "Money doesn't grow on trees." So where does it come from? 
<p>
Got a dollar bill in your pocket? Take a look at it. Notice the intricate artwork, the 
color of the ink, the texture. Take a minute and think about where and how your dollar
 bill was made.
<p>
Today your U.S. dollar bill, or <I><A Name="bank note">bank note</A></I>, is the most recognized and sought-after 
money in the world. But the United States did not invent paper money. Most <I><A Name="notaphilists">notaphilists</A></I>
 and <I><A Name="numisatists">numismatists</A></I> credit the Chinese with the idea. From China, the concept of paper
  money to replace heavy coins spread to the rest of the world.
<p>
Paper notes have circulated in the United States since Colonial days. By 1836, at 
least 7,000 varieties of paper currency were in circulation, issued by state banks. 
But in 1862, the United States found itself in need of issuing government paper money
 to finance the Civil War. To accomplish this, it created the <I><A Name="bureau of engraving and printing">Bureau of Engraving and
  Printing</A></I> in Washington, DC.

The design of the current dollar bill is a process of 65 complicated and distinct 
steps. It begins with highly skilled engravers who hand-cut portraits, lettering, and
 ornamentation into soft steel to make the original <I><A Name="die masters">die masters.</A></I> 
<p>
Look at your dollar bill again. Notice that the images are a series of fine lines, 
dots, and dashes. This process of engraving is the first step of <I><A Name="intaglio printing">intaglio printing.</A></I> 
Next, the images of the die master are transferred to a <I><A Name="printing plate">printing plate</A></I>. Printing plates
 are then chromium-coated and readied for the high-speed presses. 
<p>`
Sheets of paper made of a special cotton-linen blend speed through the presses under 
14 tons of pressure per square inch. This pressure forces the paper into the recessed 
lines of the plate where it picks up the ink. First the backs of the bills are printed
 with green ink, and then the faces are printed with black ink. Serial numbers and the
  Treasury and the Federal Reserve District seals and numbers are <I><A Name="overprint">overprinted</A></I> onto the
   notes. 
<p>
The sheets are cut into smaller units, packaged into <I><A Name="bricks">bricks</A></I>, and distributed to the
 Federal Reserve Bank Districts. They, in turn, distribute them to individual banks.
  Eventually, the dollar bills wind up in our pockets. Right where you found yours!

If you could design your own paper money, what would it look like?  What images and 
symbols would you incorporate into your design?  What security features would you 
provide to prevent counterfeiting?  What paper would you use?  Give this project a try
 and see how inventive you can be.<p>
 
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul><li>acetate or plastic sheet at least 1/8" thick
<li>sharp scissors
<li>rubber roller or wood burnisher
<li>damp paper of various types
<li>cheesecloth
<li>plate ink
</ul><p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss the distinguishing features and symbols of U.S. bank notes and bank notes
 from other countries. Design your own bank note on paper before engraving your plastic.
<LI>Cut the plastic to the size of your bank note. Using pieces of wire or a 
straightened pin, engrave your sheet. This approach roughly simulates the intaglio 
printing process used at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. 
<li>Next, coat the surface of the sheet with ink, making sure that the engraved lines 
are filled. Wipe the ink off the surface with the cheesecloth without wiping the filled
 engraved lines. 
<li>When you are ready, lay damp paper over the sheet and roll the rubber roller over
 the paper to pick up the images. The most effective method is to rub a wood burnisher
  over the area where the design is located. Do not use a wooden roller. Cut your 
  printed "bank notes."
<li>Repeat the process for the backside of the "bank note." 
</ol><p>
Extend the activity. Have committees design denominations of bank notes for class 
currency. Discuss the worth of each set of bills. Use the currency for payment of 
"goods and services" in the class to simulate the role of money in society.

<A Name="try this"></A>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif>TRY THIS!</h3>
Invite a local notaphilist or numismatist to show his or her collection to your class. 
Discuss the process of collecting money and determining the quality of individual 
pieces. Start a class penny collection to incorporate some of the concepts discussed.
<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif>TRY THIS!</h3>
How does U.S. paper money compare to the paper money of other countries? Start a class
 collection. Invite your classmates to share money from around the world that they may
  have at home. Compare and contrast the sizes, designs, counterfeiting prevention 
  techniques, and qualities of the material. Make enlarged copies of this paper money
   and put them on display.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Research the symbolism of "The Great Seal of the United States" as displayed on the
 back of the one-dollar bill. What is the meaning of "E Pluribus Unum"?  What is the
  eagle holding and how many stars are above its head? What is the date in Roman 
  numerals at the base of the pyramid, and what does the eye signify at its top? 
<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Plan an imaginary trip to a foreign country. Look at the "foreign exchange" chart in
 the business section of the local newspaper. How much money should you bring along 
 in U.S. dollars? Convert that amount of money into the currency of the country you
  have chosen to visit.<p>

 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
Since the earliest days of Hollywood, movie fans have been enthralled by the
transformations made by actors when they don makeup to become out-of-this-world
characters.  In those early days, a makeup artist had to be as much a scientist
as an actor, experimenting with materials not nearly as sophisticated as we
have today.  <p>
The first true makeup magician was Lon Chaney Sr., often called the "man of a
thousand faces."  Doing all his own work, Chaney used materials such as fish
skin, mortician's wax, and grease paint to accent his facial features for
different parts.  At one point, he even cut off the tips of cigar holders and
inserted them into his nose to appear more authentic for a character role.<p>
One of the most important makeup artists, Max Factor, was also a <a href="#two">chemist</a>.  He
developed makeup that would not melt under the hot lights.  In 1914 he invented
"Supreme Grease Paint" that helped reduce the glare of the makeup under the
harsh lighting on the set.  In 1937 he developed <a href="#four">Pancake makeup</a>, which not only
became the industry standard for use in color films, but revolutionized the
entire cosmetics industry.<p>
Jack Pierce and Maurice Seiderman were two famous makeup artists who worked in
the 1930s and revolutionized the movie business.  Both men studied human
anatomy in an effort to make their non-human characters more lifelike.  In
Frankenstein, Pierce transformed Boris Karloff into the mummy and the monster,
and he turned Bela Legosi into the menacing Count Dracula.  Seiderman perfected
the human aging process so well that he successfully created 37 distinct looks
for Orson Wells in Citizen Kane.  Whereas their predecessors used wax as their
primary makeup ingredient, both Pierce and Seiderman had the advantage of
working with latex rubber, invented in 1929.  <a href="#three">Latex</a> had many advantages over
wax because it didn't crack and could be applied in thin coats to make the skin
more lifelike.<p>
Even though things have come a long way since the days of Lon Chaney Sr., the
one constant that all makeup artists use is time.  To create the most lifelike
characters, layer after layer of makeup is applied; each layer must be allowed
to dry before applying the next.  During the filming of Elephant Man, actor
John Hurt needed 13 different <a href="#one">appliances</a> and eight hours in the makeup room to
prepare for each day's shoot.

<h1>You've Got the Look!</h1>
Use science, math, and creativity to transform your face.<br>
</center>
<p>
Create your own "creature feature" using makeup.  To get a realistic yet
fearsome look, you must employ some geometry, build on your anatomy, and design
the proper color contrast.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>assorted makeup items including mascara, lipstick, powder, rouge, and
pancake foundation<br>
<li>assorted appliances, such as artificial fingernails and teeth, wigs,
etc., available at costume shops<br>
<li>sketch pad<br>
<li>drawing pencils and pastels<br>
<li>tape measure<br>
<li>camera and film<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Start your creation by making a life-size drawing of your face, carefully
measuring the placement of your eyes, nose, mouth, etc.<p>
<li>Sketch the type of look you want by drawing in angles, hair, teeth, and
color contrast.  Write down the steps that you will follow to build your
face.<p>
<li>After you have drawn the type of features your monster face will have and
have written down the procedures you will follow, begin applying makeup and
appliances on your own face or the face of a friend.  Modify your steps if
things don't go as planned so that you will have a formula for recreating the
face in the future.  Once you have finished your creation, take a photograph of
your creature.<p>
</ol>

You can create authentic-looking scars by using unflavored powdered gelatin.
Mix about one teaspoon of gelatin with one teaspoon of hot water.  Stir until
gooey and apply to the body quickly to prevent hardening.  Try to make the scar
as irregular as possible.  To make a bloody scar, add some red food coloring,
and touch up with face powder when dry.

Find a makeup book that describes what was done in the movie Little Big Man to
age the title character, played by Dustin Hoffman.  For example, foggy contact
lenses were used to make the actor's eyes lose their bright, youthful
appearance.  What changes occur on a person's face as he or she ages from 20
years old to 80 years old?

Movie-makeup artists do more than just work on monster faces.  They are often
responsible for making actors appear as though they have just been through a
horrible accident.  Experiment with making fake blood by using a variety of
household items like catsup, powdered-drink mixes, and cornstarch.  One recipe
combines one ounce of red food coloring with one pint of clear corn syrup.  To
this, add one or two teaspoons of yellow food coloring and about an ounce of
water (recipe from D. Smith's book -- see Resources).

Poll your friends on who their favorite movie monsters are.  What aspects of
their makeup made them particularly scary, gross, gruesome, or funny?  Collect
still photos or videotapes of movie monsters and assemble a "rogues gallery."
What techniques did the makeup artists use to create their creatures?

The sculpted heads of Washington,Jefferson, Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt measure 60 feet from chin tohairline. Noses are 20 feet long, and mouths stretch 18 feet. Had thepresidents been carved full-body, they would stand 465 feet tall. (TheStatue of Liberty stands 151 feet tall; the statue of President Lincolnin the Lincoln Memorial is 20 feet tall.)<p>In 1927, South Dakota commissioned sculptor Gutzon Borglum to create amassive tourist attraction, "...colossal art, in a scale with the peoplewhose life it expresses." Borglum chose to create his work from MountRushmore, knowing that it was a solid mass of granite.<p>Granite is a tough, hard <A HREF="#rock"><i>rock</i></A> because it consists of interlockingcrystals of the minerals quartz, feldspar, and mica. This granite formedat great depth, about 13 kilometers (7.8 miles), when a body of moltenrock (magma) rose and cooled slowly, pushing up a dome-shaped structurenow known as the Black Hills. This dome measures about 200 kilometers(120 miles) long and 95 kilometers (57 miles) wide.<p>Weathering breaks rock down into smaller pieces. Granite resistsweathering more than layered and bedded sedimentary rocks do. Rockoutcrops are constantly subjected to the elements, which gradually causechemical changes in the rock's minerals. Oxygen and carbon dioxide inrunoff waters produce <A HREF="#chemical"><i>chemical weathering</i></A>. <A HREF="#physical"><i>Physical weathering</i></A> occurswhen water, lodged in <A HREF="#fracture"><i>fractures</i></A> in the rock, freezes and expands in alldirections, forcing the sides of the fractures apart. Tree roots havethe same effect. Rocks exposed to long periods of alternating heat andfreezing disintegrate into sand and clay.<p>To preserve the Mount Rushmore sculpture, experts needed to predictwhich of the granite blocks would shift. They conducted a $250,000high-tech checkup, which included <A HREF="#photogrammetry"><i>photogrammetry</i></A> and 3-D, AutoCADimaging. First, they shot a series of 300 overlapping photographs of themonument from precision cameras mounted on an airplane and a helicopter.From data provided by these photographs, a computer created 3-Dprojections of the internal fracture system.<p>With these images, preservationists can estimate the potential fordamage to the monument.  They can determine which fractures are stable,which will need to be filled with <A HREF="#silicone"><i>silicone</i></A>, and which will eventuallyhave to be held together with steel pins to prevent movement.<p><h2><b>CONNECTIONS</b></h2><p> Water and wind, the two most powerful agents of erosion, candestroy the grandest human-created structures.

Imagine that you could step through a time portal and get a firsthand look at
what daily life in ancient Egypt was like. For decades, <A HREF="#one">archaeologists</A> have been
taking just these types of journeys, and their tour guides have been the
mummified remains of individuals who died centuries ago. Even though their lips
are silent, <A HREF="#five">mummies</A> speak volumes to those who know how to ask the right
questions.<P>
When most people hear the word &quot;mummy,&quot; they usually think of ancient
Egypt. But mummies have been found all over the world, including China, Europe,
Peru, and Mexico. In fact, many mummies have formed naturally without any human
preparation at all.<P>
For mummification to occur, all water must be removed from the body. Little or no
decomposition from bacterial action can take place. As you might expect, most
mummies have been discovered in desert environments. But they have also been
found in peat <A HREF="#two">bogs</A>, where the water is extremely acid and has little or no
oxygen, and in the tundra, where individuals have become trapped in glacial ice.
In both environments, bacteria cannot break down the body tissue. Some scientists
argue whether &quot;bog men&quot; and &quot;ice men&quot; are true mummies, but
these bodies still can reveal a great deal about the world they lived in.<P>
The earliest Egyptian mummies date back to around 3200 B.C. By interpreting the
text on the walls of tombs, scientists have learned that the mummification
process evolved over time. In early days, preparers would simply treat the body
by covering it with a natural salt, called <A HREF="#six">natron</A> (now called baking soda), to
help dry it out, and then wrap it in bandages soaked in a type of resin. By about
1500 B.C., the art of mummification reached its peak. Before treating the body,
morticians would remove the brain and many vital organs. Then they would pack the
abdominal cavity with natron, sand, or sawdust and immerse the body in more
natron for about 40 days. After that, the body was washed, repacked with spices
and more natron, and wrapped in bandages. The whole process took about 70
days.<P>
People were often buried with food, tools, jewelry, clothes, and even pets. By
studying these artifacts and using modern-day clinical analysis on the mummies,
scientists have unlocked many mysteries about diet, health, and even grooming
habits. With the help of <A HREF="#three">CAT scans</A>, <A HREF="#seven">X rays</A>, <A HREF="#four">MRIs</A>, and other clinical techniques,
these silent sentries of past civilizations tell us much about how they lived.<P>

1.  Some believe that opening tombs to study mummies shows disrespect for the
dead. Others feel that it is justified for the valuable information it reveals.
Does the need for scientific knowledge outweigh the rights of the dead? <P>

<li>large box of table salt<BR>
<li>large box of Epsom salts<BR>
<li>large box of baking soda<BR>
<li>knife<BR>
<li>eight 12-oz disposable plastic cups<BR>
<li>measuring cup<BR>

<li>roll of masking tape <BR>
<li>sensitive balance or food scale<BR>
<li>piece of graph paper and pencil<P>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Slice the two apples into quarters so that you have eight slices similar in
size. Place a piece of tape on each cup and write the words &quot;starting
weight.&quot; Select one slice, weigh it, and record the weight on the outside of
cup 1. Follow the same procedure with the other seven apple slices until each cup
has been labeled with the appropriate starting weight.<BR>
<li>Add exactly 1/2 cup of baking soda to <BR>
cup 1, making sure to completely cover the apple. Write the words &quot;baking
soda only&quot; on the outside label. Fill cup 2 with 1/2 cup Epsom salts. Fill
cup 3 with 1/2 cup table salt. Make sure you label each cup.<BR>
<li>Repeat the same procedure for cups 4-6 using a 50:50 mix of Epsom and table
salts in cup 4, 50:50 mix of table salt and baking soda in cup 5, and a 50:50 mix
of baking soda and Epsom salts in cup 6. Again, make sure each cup has the
correct label.<BR>
<li>In cup 7 make a mixture of 1/3 baking soda, 1/3 Epsom salts, and 1/3 table
salt. Leave cup 8 alone as a control. Place the cups on a shelf out of direct
sunlight and let them sit for seven days. After a week has gone by, take out each
apple slice, brush off as much salt as possible, and reweigh. (Do not rinse the
apple off because that will rehydrate it.) Compare the starting and ending
weights of each slice and calculate the percentage of weight which is moisture
lost for each by dividing the difference in weight by the starting weight.<P>
</ol>
Questions<BR>
1.  Which compound would seem to work best at making an apple mummy?<BR>
2.  Would you have achieved the same results if you used a whole, unpeeled apple?
Try it and find out.<BR>
3.  What was the point of leaving one of the apple slices in a cup without any
salt at all?<BR>
4.  Where did the moisture in the slices go? How could you confirm this?<P>

Salts and special drying solutions played important roles in preserving mummies,
but they also served another purpose. Before refrigerators and freezers, people
had to preserve food by pickling, drying, salting, and smoking. Visit a local
food store and see how many foods you can find that have been preserved the same
way as mummies. Try your hand at drying different fruits. How do the textures and
tastes compare?<P>

Find out how hard it is to reconstruct pottery at an archaeological site.
Assemble five or six old clay flower pots and decorate them on the outside with
either magic marker or paint. Try to make each design distinctive. Now, place all
the pots into a large paper bag and close the top. With a hammer, gently bang on
the pots inside the bag until they are all broken into pieces. Next, shake the
bag several times and dump out half the pieces. Using white glue, try to
reassemble as many of the original pots as you can.<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>

How do you look inside something without opening it up? This is a problem that
archaeologists face every time they find a new mummy. To get an idea of how tough
this really is, try the following activity. Take an old shoe box with a lid and
have a friend place a &quot;mystery object&quot; inside. Tape the lid closed and
try to figure out what's inside by sliding it back and forth, shining a light in
it, tapping on it with a pencil, etc. The only thing you can't do is open it up
and look inside!<P>

<i>How do forensic scientists help solve murders?</i></center><p><hr>

<p>
<ul>
<li>What is the first thing the police do when they arrive at a murder scene?  
<li>What kind of evidence are they looking for?  
<li>How is evidence gathered and stored?  
<li>How important can crime scene material be in court?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Whenever a person is murdered, the police initiate a thorough investigation into the crime, crime scene and friends 
and family of the victim.  Each aspect of the investigation is important, but often it is the physical evidence of the 
crime that catches and convicts the criminal.<p>

Criminal investigations involve a variety of scientific fields and complex instrumentation.  Chemistry, physics and 
biology are used in combination when detectives and laboratory technicians investigate a murder.  Special tests 
include determining blood alcohol levels, using chemicals to make almost invisible blood stains very visible and 
typing blood to identify possible suspects.  Geometry and trigonometry help the investigators evaluate critical 
evidence like the angles of lethal blows and the <A href="#trajectory">trajectory</a> of bullets.  The tools of criminal investigations include 
computers, sophisticated photographic equipment, lasers, microscopes and other scientific equipment.<p>  

The study of both <A href="#forensic">forensics</a> and <A href="#criminology">criminology</a> require excellent observation skills and objectivity.  The first official 
who arrives at the crime scene works quickly to seal off the area and preserve the scene as much as possible.  Usually 
no one enters until the field investigator has had a chance to look about and collect every piece of evidence like hair 
and fiber samples, pieces of clothing or other personal belongings.  Only then do other police officers or medical 
personnel enter the area.<p>  

When a piece of evidence is found at the scene of the crime, investigators are always careful to keep it in a labeled 
and sealed package until it can be safely stored in the police vault.  It is only opened again when the case goes to 
court.  This kind of evidence care-taking is especially important in drug-related cases when drugs are seized.  
Regardless, it is against the law to tamper with any kind of evidence.<p>

<h1><center><B>Activity Page</B></center></h1>

<B>Step Right In!</B><p>
Learn how you can capture foot prints and simulate your own criminal investigation.<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
Scene investigators are always on the lookout for finger and foot prints.  These clues can be essential in identifying 
or eliminating murder suspects.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/murder.gif" hspace=10>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Plaster of Paris
<li>Water
<li>Hair spray</ul>
<p>
1.  Divide your class into investigation and criminal teams.  Have the "criminals" go outside and make footprints in 
some soft soil.  Have some people wear their shoes and have others take them off.<p>
2.  While the "criminal" team is outside, the "investigation" team should mix the Plaster of Paris with water.   Try 
to keep the consistency thick so that the impressions can retain small details.<p>
3.  The "investigators" should then locate the "criminals" footprints and spray each with the hair spray.  This will 
keep the soil in place when you begin to make your mold.<p>
4.  Pour the Plaster of Paris into the prepared footprints.  Pour slowly from the sides and be careful not to disturb 
the area.<p>
5.  Allow the mold to set. <p> 
6.  Have the investigation team try to match the footprints to the correct member of the "criminal" team.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/murder2.gif" hspace=10><p>

<B>Questions</B><p>

1.  What types of soil would tend to make better prints?<p>
2.  Would an actual footprint or a print from a shoe or boot be more distinctive? Why?<p>
3.  What conditions could keep the footprints from showing up very well?  What properties does hair spray have that 
makes it useful for shoe printing?<p>
<br>
<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

The orientation and placement of objects can be very important in criminal investigations.  Learn about drawing to 
scale to make your own representative drawings.  Measure your class room and any large pieces of furniture in the room.
If one foot equals one half inch, how could you draw the room on graph paper.  Ask someone to lay down in the room.  
Using their height and location can you draw them into your paper crime scene?<p>  

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Collect a couple of pine cones or sea shells.  Have several other people select one and study it for two minutes.  
Collect the pine cones or sea shells.  Have everyone try to draw their particular object.  Look at the group of items. 
Can you identify yours?  After looking at someone else's drawing can you identify their item?<p>  

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Have a person very quickly run into the classroom unexpectedly for about 10 seconds.  They should be dressed in an 
unusual way.  Write down everything you remember about the person including his/her size, hair color, clothing, or 
other details.  Compare your list with other classmates.  How many clues could you list?  How could you improve your 
observation skills?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>

Practice fingerprinting by using an ink pad and white pieces of paper.  Each finger should be rolled from side to side 
to make a good print.  Be careful with the ink and your clothing.  (If some of your friends do not want to take their 
fingerprints, be sure that you respect their privacy.)  Compare everyone's fingerprints.  What kind of differences do 
you see?  Are there differences between your fingers' fingerprints?<p><p>

<p>
When we step outside each morning to pick up our newspaper, most of us don't
consider the technology needed to produce it. From the moment a reporter starts
on a story to the point when you read the headlines, anywhere from several dozen
to several hundred people have applied the latest technology to put the news in
your hands. Gone are typewriters and mechanical typesetting machines. Modern
newspaper staffs depend on computers, digital imaging, satellite technology, and
even robots to get the job done.
<p> 
Reporters write their stories on computerterminals tied into a central computer network. From it, editors can access the
stories, edit them, and electronically format them for layout on a page. The
final edited story is then photo-printed and passed to a designer, who creates a
full-page layout on a <A HREF="#compsheet"><i>composing sheet</i></A>. At large national papers and wire
services, a story may be <A HREF="#digitized"><i>digitized</i></A> and sent via satellite to another location for
typesetting. <p> To reproduce color photographs and illustrations in print,
technicians scan the image with a laser sensor that separates it into four
process colors--yellow, magenta, cyan,  and black. Each color separation consists
of a series of closely spaced dots of varying sizes. The larger the dot, the more
dense that color ink will appear on the final printing. 
<p>
This information goes into a computer and is later retrieved to produce proofs and negatives. The
production department combines the <A HREF="#colorsep"><i>color separation</i></A> negatives with the typeset
story to make the <A HREF="#printplates"><i>printing plates</i></A>.
<p> At most newspapers, printers make plates from negative film by coating thin aluminum sheets with chemicals sensitive to
ultraviolet light. They then place the negatives against the sheets and expose
them to ultraviolet light. The chemicals react and burn an image onto the plate.
Before printing, the plates receive additional chemical treatment so that the ink
only sticks to places where letters and pictures appear. 
<p> 
The press operator mounts the plates onto the press. Rotating drums are used for each color to do
the actual printing. The first, onto which the plates are mounted, is coated by
rollers with ink and water. This action passes the negative image onto a
rubber-coated <A HREF="#blanket"><i>blanket</i></A> drum.  The blanket then presses the image onto the paper to
create a new positive image. Since the metal plate offsets the image onto the
blanket first, this printing device has become known as an <A HREF="#offpress"><i>offset press</i></A>. <p>

<h1><b>IN LIVING COLORS</h1></b> <b>Discover how only four colors of ink can
produce an entire spectrum of colors on a printed page.</b> <pre> </pre><h2><b><A
NAME="MAIN">Main Activity</a></h2></b> <p>

Anyone who has ever mixed paints knows that a few primary colors in combination
can produce a whole rainbow. When newspapers and magazines reproduce color
images, they pass a prepared image over four different presses, each one adding a
different color ink. If the proportions of ink and the preparation of the images
are just right, the final picture will appear in full color. In printing, the
four colors used are yellow, magenta, cyan, and black. In this activity, you will
blend colors to produce your own full-color images.
<p> <b>Materials</b><ul> 
<li>several sheets of white bond paper 
<li>red, blue, and yellow water-based,fine-point markers 
<li>good-quality magnifying glass 
<li>color picture from a newspaper or magazine</ul>
 <ol> 
 <li>Look at a color picture in a newspaper under
the magnifying glass. You'll see that the picture is really made up of many dots
of different colors. With high enough magnification, you'll see that the dots are
actually only four colors:  yellow, magenta (red), cyan (blue), and black. These
small dots are closely spaced and occasionally overlap each other. From a
distance, they appear to blend together into continuous colors.

<li>Begin your drawing by using the red marker to make a random pattern of
closely spaced dots on the paper.  Make sure that you leave some space between
the dots and make the dots as small as possible.

<li>Take the blue marker and fill in about one-half of the spaces between the
red dots. Continue off to the other side of the red dots to make a pattern of
blue dots on the white paper. Again, remember to keep the dots as small as
possible.

<li>Examining the pattern closely, you should see only red and blue dots. Take
the paper and hold it at arm's length from your face. The greater the distance
from your eye, the more you should start to see purple in the area where the dots
overlap. That's because your eyes blend the dots and interpret them as a new
color.

<li>Add some more red dots to the white background and then fill in one-half of
the spaces with yellow dots. What color do you expect to appear? If you said
orange, you'd be right.  Experiment by blending all three colors in different
concentrations, and soon you'll be creating full-color images. </ol><p>
<center><img src="Images/newspaper.gif" width=250 height=150></center>

<b>Questions</b><ol> <p>
<li>Newspapers aren't the only things that blend color
by using tiny dots. Can you find other objects in your house that work in a
similar way? Hint: You'll need a magnifier and an electron beam to see them! 
<li>When the dots on your picture created other colors, they did so using the optical
receptors in your brain. How does this compare to mixing paints to get different
colors? Your eyes can only see red, blue, and green, yet the primary pigments are
red, blue, and yellow. How can you explain this? </ol><p> <hr> 

<b><A NAME="TRY"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></a></b><p> Predict which section of your newspaper has the
largest percentage of advertisements. Then take each section of the newspaper
(world news, style, sports, and so on) and calculate the area of each newspaper
page. What percentage of each section is advertising? Was your prediction
correct? What do the percentages of advertisements and types of advertisements
tell you about the readers of that newspaper section? Next, calculate the area
devoted to advertisements. 
<p> <img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Contact a local newspaper to
arrange a trip to see the different departments in action. Most large dailies
offer organized tours for school classes, groups, and organizations.
 <p><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> One picture is worth a thousand words. To see how effectively
pictures can tell stories, take several photos of people, places, and events.
Write a short caption for each, describing the situation. Give the photos to
friends to see how much information they can gather from just looking at the
photos. Compare their answers to your captions to see if every picture does
indeed tell a story! <p>

<h1>Oil Spills</h1>
How do you clean up an oil spill?<br>
<hr>
</center>
Peggy gets a progress report on the clean up of one of the most well-known oil
spills, the Exxon Valdez.<br>
Segment length:  9:30<p>
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
When an oil spill occurs, often due to a ruptured oil tanker or leaking oil
rig, people around the world are awed by the damage to the environment.  Many
oil spills are caused by human error, but there are also naturally-occurring
oil spills, such as seepages from oil deposits beneath the ocean floor.
Regardless of their origins, oil spills have an impact on the environment.
<p>
The initial impact of an oil spill on the environment is familiar to those who
hear about the event and see its effects on the evening news:  a film of oil
spreading across the surface of the body of water; oil-stained beaches and
shorelines; waterfowl and marine mammals coated with oil, struggling to
survive; and the carcasses of wildlife littering the shoreline.
<p>
The environment sustains some of its most visible damage within the first few
days or months of the spill.  But what are the long-term effects of a large
spill?  Some evidence suggests that the oil from the Exxon Valdez spill may
have entered the food chain, and that the crude oil itself could continue to
wreck havoc with the environment.  Since oil floats and crude sinks, both the
surface and the bottom of the ocean ecosystem could be affected for a long
time.
<p>
Cleaning up an oil spill is no small task.  Exxon to date has spent over two
billion dollars on the Valdez cleanup operations.  There are many methods used
to clean up the oil, including <a href="#one">cold-</a> and <a href="#seven">warm-water washing</a>,
<a href="#six">storm-berm relocation</a>, and manual removal.
<p>
Nature is sometimes capable of handling the oil on her own terms.  The
spreading out of the oil slick increases its surface area, allowing many
natural processes to begin.  Low- to medium-weight crude will start to
<a href="#three">evaporate</a>.  Solution <a href="#two">emulsification</a> and 
<a href="#five">photo-chemical</a> <a href="#four">oxidation</a> also assist in the
cleanup.  All of these processes, however, require much time.
<p>
Acts of nature and acts of humans contribute to the likelihood of oil spills.
Nature's fury may twist a ship, rupture a storage tank, or prevent cleanup
operations.  Human factors such as poor judgment, lack of organization, and
quest for fossil fuels can lead to decisions that trigger accidents.

 Main Activity</h4></a>
<p>
<center>
<h1>Oil Slick</h1>
Use a small-scale model of an oil spill to observe its effects on the
environment.
</center>
<p>
You will create an oil-spill simulation, and observe the characteristics and
effects of an oil spill.  Record your observations by keeping track of how the
oil spill changes in size and appearance.<p>
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul><li>large shallow pan
<li>water
<li>dirty automotive oil
<li>drinking straw OR electric fan
<li>string
</ul><p>
1.  Pour water into the pan so that it is 2/3 filled.  Gently pour a small
amount of oil into the pan.<p>
2.  Loop the string around the "oil spill."<p>
3.  Mark the length of the string, measure it, and record the length on a data
table.<p>
4.  Wait five minutes, repeat the string measurements, and make any
observations.<p>
5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 for a total of six readings.<p>
6.  Using the straw, lightly blow on the spill to spread it out; record
observations and repeat every five minutes.  If your spill covers the entire
pan, start over.  (If you use an electric fan for this step, exercise
caution.)<p>
7.  Now, shake or vibrate the pan to create light wave action; record your
observations.<p>
Additional observations could be made by making a "shoreline" of sand and
rocks.  Note the effects of oil on these materials.<p>
<p>
Questions<p>
1.  Left alone, did the oil spread out in an organized way?  How did the oil
spread?<p>
2.  How did you promote the spread of the oil?  What kinds of conditions were
you simulating?<p>
3.  What effect did the wave action have on the spill?<p>
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"><br clear=all>
Bring in a few stuffed animals, ones that won't shrink.  Put some salad oil on
them to simulate what happens when wildlife gets covered with oil from a spill.
Try different ways of cleaning the animals.  Use dish detergent, laundry soap,
carpet cleaner, water, hair dryers, towels, and other devices to assist in the
clean up.  Devise the most efficient way to clean them.<p>
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"><br clear=all>
Fill your room with confetti, polystyrene- foam packing peanuts, or popcorn.
Develop an ingenious way (or use a fan) to distribute the material all over the
room to illustrate how haphazard and uncontrolled a spill can be.  How can the
"spill" be cleaned up quickly and efficiently?  What kind of organization or
chain of command is needed?  Have vacuum cleaners, brooms, and bags available
for the cleanup.  Now that the mess is cleaned up, what do you do with the
material?<p>
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"><br clear=all>
Conduct a debate that represents the concerns of the people or organizations
that are affected by an oil spill like the Exxon Valdez.  Interests may include
government, oil companies, the shipping industry, citizens living in the area,
fishing industries, the tourism board, and environmentalists.  Divide into
teams to research and prepare the various sides of the issue.  Focus on
specific questions, such as: "Should the government relax environmental
restrictions and encourage off-shore oil exploration in U.S. coastal waters?"
Find actual position statements from organizations to use in your arguments.<p>

<center><h1>OLYMPIC TRAINING CENER</h1>
How can biomechanics help an athlete?</center><p><hr>
David and Peggy travel to the Olympic Training Center.<p>
<UL>
<LI>What does it take to be an Olympic athlete?  
<LI>How important is training and practice for good performance?  
<LI>Do different sports require special training programs?  
<LI>How can science help Olympic athletes?</UL>

<hr><center><B>DISCUSSION</B></center><p>
Scientists have developed many devices to analyze every detail of an
athlete's performance.  Advanced sports technology employs high-speed
cinematography, force and torque measurement equipment, <A HREF="#ergometer">ergometers</A>,
electromyography, wind tunnels, mathematical modeling and many other
devices.  Athletes also employ biomechanics in their training. 
Biomechanics is the study of how the laws of physics can be applied to
the human body.<P>


The biomechanics of swimming were ignored for years because it was very
hard to quantify results in a open pool.  But with the flume, a kind of
treadmill for swimmers, scientists can now bring high-tech measurement
and analysis to the Olympic swimmer.<P>


To understand how the flume helps the swimmer improve the "streamlining"
of a stroke, involves a basic understanding of hydrodynamics.  Swimming
differs from land sports in that energy must be expended to overcome
drag forces which oppose forward movement of an object through a fluid. <P>



The swimmer pushes down into the water with the hand.  The water resists
this motion, and this force, called drag, is transmitted through the
swimmer's arm to propel the swimmer through the water.  If the swimmer
curves the hand and arm, an additional force comes into play:  lift. 
The flow of water over the hand creates the same kind of lift force
generated when air flows over an airplane wing.  The goal of a winning
swimmer is to maximize both the drag and the lift forces.  This can be
achieved with the assistance of the scientific measurements and analysis
made possible by the flume.<P>


Even non-Olympic exercisers now have access to much new technology: 
weekend joggers or bikers can have a videotape of their performance
analyzed for biomechanical advice.  Fitness clubs have stationary
exercise equipment that offers instant feedback on current and average
speeds, distance traveled and calories expended.<P>


<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P>
<OL><LI>Why would athletes want to see videos of how they perform?  
<LI>What other applications does this technology have?  Could it be used in physical therapy?  
<LI>Would you want to see movies of your performance in gym class?

Activity Page

Lights, Camera, Action!
Capture your athletic prowess on film!

Main Activity
You can learn more about your musculoskeletal system and improve your
athletic performance by watching yourself participate in sporting
activities.

Materials
-Video camera
-Blank videocassettes
-Television
-Videocassette Recorder (VCR)
-White Paper and Pencil

1.  Decide on an activity like running, swimming or skating for your
performance analysis. 
2.  Have friends or family members videotape you as you exercise.
3.  Use the still frame on your VCR to look at specific points in the
action.  Diagram the motion by tracing a sequence of these still-frames
on a single sheet of paper.
4.  Invite your gym teacher or coach to view the tape and help you
analyze the biomechanics of your performance.
5.  Compare your tapes to your classmates'. 

Questions
1.  After watching your performance, think of ways to improve your
techniques.  How else could videotaping activities be useful?  
2.  What would you watch for in an opponents tape?  What might you learn
about your own winning strategies?
3.  What other Olympic biomechanical equipment would you like to try?

TRY THIS...
Invite a marathon runner or long-distance biker or swimmer to come talk
to your class.  Ask them about the issues of pacing, fluid replacement,
mileage, speedwork and motivation.  What is the longest distance you've
ever gone in any of these sports?  How did you prepare for competition? 
How did you feel after the activity?  What damage do you think you could
do without adequate preparation?

TRY THIS...
Look into the future and try to predict the kinds of technology sports
may be using then.  Will there be new technologies or new sporting
events?  Can you create a new sport that uses both physics and
biomechanics?  Write the rules for the event and invite your friends to
compete.  What recent events have been added to the Olympic games?

TRY THIS...
Find out about the sports curriculum at your local university.  See if
they offer any classes or programs on <A HREF="#kinesiology">kinesiology</A>, exercise physiology,
sports medicine, biomechanics or the physics of sports.  Ask them for
course descriptions or typical assignments.  Discuss these programs and
try to do a few assignments with your friends.  Could these programs
help you improve your performance?  

TRY THIS...
Sometimes other people can put a lot of pressure on an athlete to
compete and win.  Think about the following information attributed to
the father of an Olympic swimmer:  "The greatest motivating factor in my
son's life has been his mother and myself. ...  There was a point when I
pushed him. ...  Swimming isn't everything; winning is."  How does this
compare to De Coubertin's philosophy of the Olympics?  Did this father
really motivate the Olympian or did he have to motivate himself?  What
effects can parental or peer pressure have on athletes?

<h1>Omnimax</h1>
How is a giant-screen movie made and projected?<br>
<hr>
</center>
David gets a wide-angle view of filmmaking when he visits a large-screen
projection facility.<br>
Segment length:  5:40
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
IMAXreg. and OMNIMAXreg. are counterpart motion picture systems using
state-of-the-art technology to project huge images of tremendous clarity.  The
projected picture, which is up to 10 times the size of a conventional screen,
extends beyond the human <a href="#three">peripheral</a> vision on all sides and puts the viewer in
the middle of the scenes as it zooms between microcosmic and macrocosmic views.
It tends to have <a href="#four">subliminal</a> effects on the viewers as well, often giving them
the feeling of motion sickness, as if they were actually taking part in the
event they are watching.
<p>
The first giant-screen IMAX showing premiered at EXPO `70 in Osaka, Japan.  The
IMAX image is projected on a vertical flat screen that is eight stories high
and 70 feet wide.  The sister OMNIMAX system premiered in 1973.  This system
projects images to fill 86% of a surrounding dome screen.  The OMNIMAX screen
is four stories high and 76 feet in diameter, with views of 180 degrees that
wrap around a tilted tier of seats.  The projected images fill the entire field
of vision, creating a three-dimensional (3-D) illusion of being transported through
any environment.  Eighty-four speakers project music and sound.  The movie reel for 
an average feature of 34 to 45 minutes is 48 inches in diameter and weighs 150 pounds, so heavy that two
people must load it into the projector.
<p>
The secret to creating the clear, big-screen imagery of the IMAX and OMNIMAX
theaters begins with the film itself.  The specially-designed IMAX and OMNIMAX
cameras photograph the largest frames ever used in motion pictures:  70<a href="#two">mm</a> wide
and 15 perforations per frame compared to a standard 35mm, 4-perforation
motion-picture frame.  The large film size is necessary because the image is
projected over such a large area.
<p>
The projection process also requires special adaptations.  The high performance
and reliability of IMAX and OMNIMAX projectors come from the unique way the
film loops, or "caterpillars," through them.  This "Rolling Loop" projector
advances the film horizontally, instead of vertically as does a regular film
projector.  This gives the super high-speed film flexibility and helps prevent
shredding.  To keep the projected image steady during projection, each frame is
positioned on fixed registration pins, and the film is held firmly against the
rear element of the lens by a vacuum.  The resulting picture and focus are
steady and clear.
<p>
The future of IMAX and OMNIMAX rests in the development of computer <a href="#one">animation</a>
and 3-D technology, already underway.
<p>

<h1>Make a Flickerbook</h1>
Create your own version of an animated movie.
</center>
<p>
Animation is made possible because our eyes perceive two slightly different
pictures, one after the other, as a moving image.  It is a physiological fact
that an image is registered onto our retina, remaining there for a bit even
though the source of the image is out of view.  The eye can register 12
pictures per second as separate images, so if the pictures appear more quickly
than this, the eye perceives them as moving pictures.  Motion pictures appear
at the rate of 24 photographs (frames) every second.
<p>
Films today consist of a strip of transparent acetate with a series of small,
sequenced frames, each representing a visual record of a moment in time.  When
the series of pictures is projected rapidly onto a screen, the illusion of
continuous action is created.
<p>
Before motion pictures were invented, people created the illusion of moving
pictures by drawing a slightly different image on each page of a book, and then
flipping through the book with a thumb.  The pictures appeared so quickly that
the eyes "saw" a steady movement.  The first "flickerbook" appeared around
1890.
<p>
Invite your students to create a small flickerbook.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>If you are making your small books from scratch, use the paper, needle and
thread, or staples to create some books of your design.  If you are using a
notebook or a pad of sticky notes, these can be your "books."<p>
<li>Have each student think of a simple story he or she would like to
illustrate.  <p>
<li>On the back side only of each page, draw a picture (close to the cut edge
of the paper) in which the action is slightly different than the action in the
previous picture.  When the picture story is finished, hold the book in the one
hand and flip the pages from front to back with the thumb of the other hand.

<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  Are there certain actions or pictures that are particularly well-suited to

the projection booth, or ask a theater owner or manager to visit your classroom
to answer some questions about theater projection.  How many rolls of film are
there in a two-hour film?  Why are so many films about two hours in length?
How do movie theaters avoid a "break" in projection when they switch
projectors?  What changes have occurred in the technology in the last five
years?  What changes do they predict?  How does standard projection differ from

Depletion of the ozone in the atmosphere can have severe consequences on earth.
Plants, animals, and humans all suffer when exposed to higher levels of
ultraviolet rays.  Food crops have stunted growth; marine phytoplankton can die
off; and humans are more vulnerable to skin cancer.
<p>
Atmospheric research in the mid-1980s indicated a serious thinning of the ozone
shield, upsetting a natural balance between oxygen and ozone in the
stratosphere.  This thinning was evident from satellite pictures and showed up
as a dark area; thus the term "ozone hole" was coined.  It was apparent to
scientists studying the ozone depletion that chemicals called
<a href="#two">chloroflourocarbons (CFCs)</a>, used in spray cans, refrigerators and air
conditioners, foam, plastics, and cleaning solvents, might be contributing to
the problem.  After being released, either during the manufacturing process or
from consumer use, CFCs reach the stratosphere.  There, chemical reactions
break apart the CFCs.  The <a href="#one">chlorine</a> then breaks down the ozone.  A single
chlorine atom can destroy 100 thousand molecules of ozone.
<p>
The degree of ozone depletion has followed an annual cycle that corresponds to
the amount of sunlight that reaches the Antarctic.  The cycle begins every year
around June when the vortex winds develop in the Antarctic.  Cold temperatures
produced by these winds create polar stratospheric clouds that capture the
floating CFCs.  For the next two months, a reaction occurs on the cloud surface
that frees the chlorine in the CFCs but keeps the chlorine contained within the
vortex area.  In September, sunlight returns to the Antarctic and triggers a
chemical reaction, causing chlorine to convert ozone to normal oxygen.<p>
Measured ozone levels usually are lowest in October.  November brings a
breakdown in the vortex that allows the ozone-rich air to combine with the
thinning ozone.  Wind currents carry this mixture over the southern hemisphere
and carry the "hole" over other areas of the earth.

Analyze and interpret the same ozone TOMS images as those used by NASA.<br>
</center>
<p>
Before information about ozone is released to the general public, scientists
spend many hours analyzing ozone data from earth and space.  Here's your chance
to be an ozone-research analyst.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>NIMBUS-7 TOMS Images:  The Twelve Octobers.  Order one for each two
students by lithograph name and number (HqL-308) from: <br>

        (301) 286-8955<br>
<li>paper<br>
<li>pencil<br>
</ul>
Note:  Instructor may wish to make photocopies of the TOMS lithographs so that
the information on the back is not available until students have interpreted
the data.
<p>
<ol>
<li>Divide students into research-analyst pairs.<p>
<li>Discuss why the Dobson Unit key will be important and note the range of the
value for each color.  (If paper copies have been made, allow time for the
students to color in the key.)<p>
<li>Use the questions below to analyze this data and to formulate
predictions.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b>
<p>
1.  Which year had the lowest ozone concentration?  Which had the highest?  Did
the level always drop from year to year?  Explain possible reasons for this.<p>
2.  What is the geographic location of the thinnest concentration?  The
thickest?  Why might this be?  Have maps or globes available to aid in
answering these questions, or superimpose lines of longitude and latitude on
the TOMS maps.<p>
3.  Why were the images taken in October?  What differences would you expect in
images taken during November, December, and January?<p>
4.  How important is the use of color in these images?   <p>
5.  Based on the October images, what predictions can you make for ozone levels
in 1995?  Justify your predictions.  <p>
6.  What information might appear in a news article reporting this data?  How
could it be presented to help the general public understand its importance?

<p>
The <A HREF="#permafrost"><i>permafrost</i></A> tunnel 10 miles north of Fairbanks, Alaska, is called a "chilly,
smelly time machine" because it exposes permafrost layers dating from 11,000 to
more than 30,000 years ago. These layers contain plant and animal remains whose
decay creates the smell.
<p>
Permafrost underlies an estimated 20%-25% of the world's land surface; it occurs
in more than 50% of Russia and Canada, 82% of Alaska, 20% of China, and probably
all of Antarctica. Permafrost in northern Siberia is 1,600 meters, (5,250 feet)
thick and it is 650 meters (2,100 feet) thick in northern Alaska.
<p>
The active surface layer of permafrost is a thin slice of tundra vegetation that
thaws every summer and freezes in winter. A frozen sublayer keeps the water on
the surface. The active layer is vulnerable to environmental damage. For example,
tracks from a passing vehicle will tear up the fragile insulating tundra,
allowing the soil to thaw into scars that may remain for hundreds of years.
<p>
Underground, permafrost consists of frozen soils ranging from gravel to silt.
Silty soil is made of fine, powdery sedimentary particles. They possess great
"wicking" capacities, enabling water to migrate and accumulate in large bodies of
ice in the permanently frozen silt. If the ice melts, the resulting silt mixture
resembles soup!
<p>
Construction disasters can be caused by such a thaw and the resulting subsidence,
or settling, of surface features. Entire megaprojects-such as the Jenpeg dam
diversion in Canada-have also been affected by the unpredictable behavior of
permafrost.
<p>
<A HREF="#thermosiphons"><i>Thermosiphons</i></A> offered one solution to permafrost on the Alaska pipeline. Other
options exist. To avoid settling, engineers try to build on bedrock or coarse,
well-drained soil with a low ice content. Builders can also maintain stable soil
by insulating structures to prevent permafrost thawing. Small, lightweight
structures may need only an airspace between floor and soil surface, created by
raising the building on stilts. Larger structures require the support of
insulated pilings driven deep into the permafrost. This technique allowed the
Russians to build entire cities on permafrost in Siberia.
<p>
Permafrost's capacity to preserve plants and animals for centuries gives
scientists a window into the past to help them assess how rapidly greenhouse
pollutants may be warming the Earth. Ground temperatures indicate past climatic
conditions and current changes in world ambient temperatures, providing an
understanding of the complex interactions of human-induced global warming, ice
melting, and potential sea level changes.

<p>
The speed with which ice melts in permafrost depends on how much heat and
pressure are applied to it. You can demonstrate these principles with coffee
cups, water, and ice.
<p>
<b>Materials</b> 
<ul>
<li> large, flat cake pan filled with water 
<li> 5 identical ceramic coffee cups with bottom rims that would make an indentation 
<li> hot water 
<li> ice water 
<li> sponge for insulation 
<li> a freezer
</ul><p><ol>
<li> Fill the pan with about 1" (2.5 cm) of water. Place it in a freezer, along
with one of the empty cups.
<p>
<li> When the water is frozen, remove the pan and cup from the freezer.
<p>
<li> Place the empty cup on the ice.
<p>
<li> Fill another cup with ice water and place it on the ice.
<p>
<li> Fill a third cup with very hot tap water and place it on the ice. (Be sure to
place all cups so that they do not touch each other.)
<p>
<li> Fill a fourth cup with heavy rocks and place it on the ice.
<p>
<li> Fill the last cup with hot tap water. Put the sponge on the ice and place the
cup on top of the sponge.
<p>
<li> If possible, place the pan with the five cups back into the freezer.
<p>
<li> Every five minutes, remove the cups that originally had hot water and refill
them with hot water.
<p>
<li> After 15 minutes, remove the pan from the freezer. Remove all five cups from
the pan. Feel the surface of the ice. Can you tell where the empty cup sat? Can
you tell which ring was created by the cup with hot water that sat directly on
the ice? How does the ice look under the insulating sponge? What about the cup
containing the rocks and the cup containing the ice water?
<p>
</ol>
<img align=right src="Images/permafrost.gif" hspace=10>

<b>Questions</b> 
<ol> 
<li> What construction techniques could minimize heat transfer from a
building to the permafrost?
<li> What construction techniques could minimize damage to a structure if permafrost melted and the surface level collapsed? 
<li> Do construction techniques for permafrost environments resemble those in earthquake zones?

<b><A NAME="try"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></A></b><p> If you must build on permafrost, you have three ways of dealing with
it--keep it frozen, thaw it out, or let the building move. Devise a plan to keep
the ground frozen, create a thawing program, and design a structure that can move
with ground subsidence. Display the plans and structure.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company was concerned about permafrost
underlying three-quarters of the 800-mile, trans-Alaska pipeline. It drilled
12,000 holes to test for permafrost. You can "drill" a test sample of your
playground. (Be sure to obtain permission.) Drill a vertical hole to create a
core, using tools like copper tubing, plastic tubing, or gardening tools for
digging bulbs. Call a local soil-testing firm for literature to share with your
class.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Ice wedges form in the permafrost tunnel when water seeps into a
crack in the frozen ground. The water freezes and ice expands, pushing out in all
directions. The wedge partially melts during its formation, allowing more water
to fill the void and expand the size of the wedge upon refreezing. Simulate the
ice wedging by packing a shoe box with dirt (preferably some fairly impermeable
soil, such as clay). Make a small crack and line it with plastic so it will hold
water. Place water in the lined crack. Freeze the box. Did the soil move? Melt
the ice, add more water to fill the plastic lining, and then refreeze the water.
The size of the space will increase, as it does in the case of an ice wedge. Is
this what happens between your house foundation and yard in winter if you live in
a cold climate?

You may have heard that photography is a "snap." That's because every picture begins 
with the snap of a shutter. When the shutter opens, light is captured and recorded on 
photographic film. It doesn't matter if the film you're shooting is black-and-white or
 color--the same chemical processes are at work.
<p>
Black-and-white film is made by suspending billions of tiny silver halide crystals in 
<I><A Name="gelatin">gelatin</A></I> and coating a clear sheet of plastic with the gelatin. Each tabular-shaped 
crystal contains silver and bromide<I><A Name="ions">ions</A></I> held together by 
strong <I><A Name="electrostatic forces">electrostatic forces</A></I>.
<I><A Name="photons">Photons</A></I> of light with the right amount of energy can change 
these crystals, producing silver ions, bromine atoms, and free <I><A Name="electrons">electrons</A></I>.
 An electron wanders through the crystal until it is captured by a silver ion. In the 
 process, silver ions are changed into black metallic silver. 
<p>
The number of silver atoms formed depends on the amount of light each crystal receives.
 In an exposed crystal, as few as four silver atoms may form. These atoms usually clump
  together in tiny dark specks too small to be seen even with the most powerful 
  microscopes. Although the silver specks remain invisible to the naked eye, they form
   a pattern that depicts the photographed subject. This is called a latent image.
<p>
In a darkroom, you immerse the film in <I><A Name="developer">developer</A></I> 
to make the latent image visible. The developer acts by pushing electrons into the film. The silver specks channel 
electrons into the exposed crystals, where more silver ions are changed to black 
metallic silver. Unexposed crystals react slowly or not at all with the developer. 
In this way, film exposed to light becomes darker than unexposed areas of the <I><A Name="emulsion">emulsion</A></I>.
 This produces a negative. 
<p>
Then you put the negative into a stop bath, where silver ions stop changing into 
silver atoms. That's because the stop bath contains a weak <I><A Name="acids">acid</A></I> that shuts off the 
supply of electrons from the developer. Next, the negative goes into the fixer. The 
fixer contains a solution (<A Name="hypo">hypo</A></I>) that dissolves silver bromide salts from the negative,
 leaving behind a dark silver image. After a final rinse in water to remove chemicals,
  the negative is ready to dry and print.
<p>
Color film is made by stacking three layers of black-and-white emulsion. Each layer is
 sensitive to one of the three primary colors of emitted light (red, blue, and green).
  When exposed to light, color film forms a latent image just as black-and-white film
   does. But during development, the developer reacts with other chemicals to form 
   colored dyes. The dyes form in the emulsion at the exact location of the exposed 
   crystals. Later, the exposed and unexposed silver is bleached out, leaving dye 
   molecules that reproduce the color of the photographed object.

<ol>
<li>Cut a 2.5-cm (1") square in the top of a shoe box. Line the inside of the shoe box 
and its cover with black construction paper attached with glue stick to help cut down 
on stray light reflections. Next, cut a 5-cm (2") square of aluminum foil and press 
it smooth on a flat surface. Use a straight pin to prick a small hole at the center 
of the aluminum foil.
<li>Now tape the aluminum foil over the cutout opening in the shoe box. Then cut a 
7.5-cm (3") square of black construction paper.  
<li>You must load your camera in a darkened room. With the room darkened, cut a sheet
 of photo-enlarging paper to fit the bottom of the shoe box. Secure the paper, 
 emulsion (or shiny) side up, by taping the four corners to the bottom of the box. 
 Replace the cover on the box and use two rubber bands to hold it in place. Insert 
 the 7.5-cm square of black construction 
paper under the rubber bands and over the pinhole to act as the shutter. Now you are 
ready to take a picture.
<li>Take your pinhole camera out on a sunny day and make a picture by sliding the 
shutter (black paper) to one side of the pinhole. A good exposure time is 10 minutes 
but you may need to try other exposure times to get the best results with your camera. 
Don't bump or move your camera while the shutter is open.  Do not hand-hold the camera--
instead, support it on an object such as a rock or chair. After the exposure, close the 
shutter and remove the exposed paper in a darkened room. To reveal the latent image, 
the paper must be developed.
<li>In a room that is either totally dark or illuminated by red light, slide the paper
 into a tray of paper developer and agitate the solution for two minutes. Remove the
  paper and allow it to drain. Next, slide the paper into a tray of fixer to make the
   image permanent. Agitate the fixer solution for four minutes, then remove the paper.
    Finally, wash your negative in a tray under running water for five minutes.
     Blot (do not rub) the negative dry with a paper towel and leave it to dry 
     overnight.</ol><p>

<center><h1>PHOTOSYNTHESIS:</h1> 
<i>How do plants make food?</i></center><p><hr>

David learns why plants are green and how water is transported in plants.<p>
<ul>
<li>What happens inside plants when the sun is shining or when it is raining?  
<li>How do plants in the desert survive?  
<li>How important are plants to our environment?  
<li>What might happen if there were none?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Of all the organisms in the natural world, green plants are the only ones that
manufacture their own food.  This 
process is called <A href="#photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and begins when
light strikes the plant's leaves (both sunlight and artificial 
light can power this process).  Cells in the plant's leaves, called <A
href="#chloroplast">chloroplasts</a>, contain a green pigment called 
<A href="#chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a> which interacts with sunlight to split the
water in the plant into its basic components.<p>  

Carbon dioxide enters the leaf through holes called <A
href="#stomata">stomata</a> and combines with the stored energy in the
chloroplasts 
through a chemical reaction to produce a simple sugar.  The sugar is then
transported through tubes in the leaf to 
the roots, stems and fruits of the plants.  Some of the sugar is used immediately
by the plant for energy; some is 
stored as starch; and some is built into a more complex substance, like plant
tissue or cellulose.<p>

Fortunately for us, plants often produce more food than they need, which they
store in stems, roots, seeds or 
fruit.  We can obtain this energy directly by eating the plant itself or its
products, like carrots, rice or 
potatoes.  Photosynthesis is the first step in the food chain which connects all
living things.  Every creature on 
earth depends to some degree on green plants.<p>

The oxygen that is released by the process of photosynthesis is an essential
exchange for all living things.  Forests 
have been called the "lungs of the earth" because animals inhale oxygen and
exhale carbon dioxide in the process of 
breathing, and plants take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen in the process
of photosynthesis.<p>  

But every year, over 28 million acres of tropical forest are cut and then burned
to clear land for farming.  
Deforestation is also blamed for the "greenhouse effect" (global warming) which
results from the build-up of carbon 
dioxide and other gases.<p>
<hr>
<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>The Newton's Apple segment on photosynthesis talks about a few of the
implications of rain forest destruction for 
people around the world.  What are other possible implications?  What do you
think should be done?
<li>How is the carbon-oxygen cycle between animals and plants like a battery that
powers our biosphere?
<li>Why is the term "food chain" a good metaphor?  Would the metaphor "food web"
work as well?</ol>

<B>LIGHTS OUT!</B><p>
Discover what happens if you change the patterns of a plant's 
light source.<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
Without enough sunlight, plants cannot use the process of photosynthesis to
produce food. <p> 
<img align=right src="Images/photosynthesis.gif" hspace=10>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Small shrub, tree or house plant
<li>Cardboard or aluminum foil
<li>Scissors
<li>Paper clips</ul>
<p>
1.  Pick a shrub, tree or houseplant that you can use for an experiment.<p>
2.  Using the cardboard or aluminum foil, cut out some geometrical shapes like a
circle, square or triangle.  Make 
sure your shapes are big enough to make a patch that will cover nearly half of
the plant leaf.<p>
3.  Paperclip each shape on a different leaf.<p>
4.  If you use a house plant, place it near a south, west or east window were it
will get plenty of sunlight.  Make 
notes about the weather each day and add them to your observations.<p>
5.  After four days, remove the shapes from the leaves and observe each of the
leaves that had a shape covering it.<p>
6.  Compare the areas on the leaf that were covered with the shape to other parts
of the leaf.<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  What has happened to the leaves?  Describe the effects that the lack of
sunshine has on leaves.  What has or 
hasn't happened in the different parts of the leaf?<p>
2.  What is the best environment for a house plant?  Why?<p>
3.  Where have you seen effects like these in nature?<p>
4.  Where would you expect to find fewer plants outside because of a lack of
sunlight?<p>

It is the year 2040 and you are a research scientist.  The amount of sunlight
that reaches the earth has been reduced 
because of some major event like pollution, volcanoes or global fires.  Farmers
are asking you for help to save their 
failing crops.  Figure out ways that you might help.<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430

Design a way that you can make grass grow faster.  Mark off two
10 cm x 10 cm boxes of grass and vary the amount of light each square gets.  How
did light affect the grass?  What 
other changes could you make that would help grass grow faster?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430

Take a trip to a local greenhouse to observe how they raise plants.  Find out how
they use light, water or other 
elements to increase growth and productivity.<p>

Discover if plants need soil for photosynthesis.  Try growing a sweet potato just
in water.  Put the bottom third of 
the potato in a glass or jar of water.  If you need help keeping the rest of the
potato out of the water, you may want 
to insert toothpicks in the potato so that they rest on the rim of the glass. 
Add water every two to three days to 
keep the water level the same.  Make sure the potato receives a lot of light, and
watch it closely.  Do roots start to 
grow in the water?  Will the potato be able to sprout leaves or produce
potatoes?<p><p>

<H2><B><A Name="insights">INSIGHTS & CONNECTIONS</A></B></H2>
<p> 
<I><A Name="raptor">Raptors</A></I> are majestic birds that can vary greatly in size 
and <I><A Name="habitat">habitat</A></I>. But they have one thing in common--they 
feed on <I><A Name="carrion">carrion</A></I> or meat taken by hunting.
<p>
Although a large raptor like a bald eagle can have a wingspan up to 8 feet long and 
body length up to 31/2 feet, it and other raptors are nevertheless vulnerable animals. 
Birds of prey may encounter many things in their environment that could harm them--often 
because of their proximity to humans. The birds may be poisoned by eating prey that 
has consumed poison. They may get hit by a car or caught in a leg hold trap. They 
could become ill from disease or parasites.
<p>
When people find an injured bird of prey, they often contact a veterinarian, a raptor 
center, or their local conservation department. Commonly, raptors that come to a 
veterinary center have injuries to bone or flesh. Through expert care, many of them 
can be nursed back to health and returned to the wild.
<p>
A veterinarian thoroughly examines the injured raptor to assess its illness or injury. 
The examination might include blood tests and radiographs, pictures taken with X rays 
that show the bird's bones and internal organs. Depending on what the doctor finds, 
the raptor may need to be kept in captivity and treated with medication, surgery, and 
bandages. To repair a broken bone, the veterinarian may fix the break surgically, 
applying a pin, a plate and screws, or an external splint. A cast or bandage prevents 
the broken bone from moving. The injured bird is confined and fed its natural diet. 
Meanwhile, caretakers monitor its health and recovery.
<p>
While it is recovering, the bird loses some muscle strength due to its limited activity. 
Once it is healthy again, its <I><A Name="rehabilitation">rehabilitation</A></I> takes
 a new course, shifting to a program that prepares it for reentry into its natural habitat. At the raptor center, the bird 
receives physical therapy appropriate to its specific injury. For a broken wing, for 
example, the program would help restore the bird's range of motion and coordination 
and prepare its muscles, heart, and airways for the physical exertion critical to its 
survival in the wild.
<p>
Controlled practice flights are an important part of rehabilitation. Outdoor flights 
lengthen as the raptor's strength improves. Once the bird has gained endurance, the 
center's staff releases it into its natural habitat. From there, it reestablishes 
itself in its environment, hunting and soaring overhead. Hopefully, it will reproduce, 
ensuring its species' place in the ecosystem.

<pre><h2>The Rap on Raptors</h2>
<h3>You can identify various raptors as they fly through the sky.</h3></pre> 
<p><hr>
<img src="rap.gif">
<h2><A Name="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2>
We often see raptors only as they are flying through the sky. By studying raptor 
silhouettes, you can learn to identify different species from the ground. Although 
raptors may have different outward appearances, they share many features that help 
them catch their prey. Discuss which features various species of raptors share and 
learn about the food chain leading up to a bird of prey.<p>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>transparencies of various raptor silhouettes. (Downoad GIF file of raptor 
silouhettes. Several are included as illustrations on the page. You can also find more 
silhouettes from books listed in the resource section.)
<li>transparencies of drawings showing details of the anatomy of different raptors. 
(You'll find these in reference books listed in the resources.)
<li>overhead projector
<li>paper
<li>pencil
</ul>

<ol><li>Enlarge and make transparencies out of the three silhouettes on this page. 
Project the silhouettes on the overhead projector. 
<li>Study each silhouette and try to identify each type of raptor. 
(The three pictured are identified at the bottom of the page.)
<li>Project the detailed drawings of various types of raptors on the overhead 
projector. Observe the different parts of the bird's anatomy. Take note of the similarities among
 various raptor species. 
<li>Sketch a bird of prey's food chain. Start with a raptor at the top of the food 
chain and work down. Where does each "layer" in the food chain get its food?  
</ol><p>
<pre><img src="bird2.gif"><img src="bird3.gif></pre>
<img src="bird1.gif"><hr>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<ol><li>Discuss the parts of a raptor's anatomy that are crucial for it to catch prey. 
How do these parts differ from nonraptor bird species?<p>
<li>What factors in a raptor's food chain could contribute to the decline or health 
of a raptor species? Have these factors changed over time?
</ol><p>
<hr>
<A Name="try this"></A> 

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Plan a trip to a zoo to visit the raptors. Schedule a period with the zoo's raptor 
specialist to learn why the birds are in captivity, what foods they eat, and what 
role they serve as examples of raptors in the wild.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
If you have a raptor center nearby, schedule a tour of its facilities. Or ask a special
ist to bring a raptor to class for close inspection. Have the tour guide or specialist
 explain what people should do when they find an injured raptor, and what steps the 
 center takes when a bird is brought to the facility.<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Invite a wildlife specialist from your state conservation department to discuss the 
types of nests in which various raptors hatch and care for their young. What are the 
nests made of and  where are they located? Will nesting raptors adopt young birds that
 are not their own?<p>

<p>
They are the giants of the earth, bigger than dinosaurs or whales. They tower over 67 
meters (220 feet) high, outlive most other forms of life, and have inspired pioneers, 
poets, and presidents alike. They are the redwoods of California. <p>

Actually, the term "redwood" refers to several species. For example, the towering 
coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) grow in the mild, misty climate along the 
Pacific coast of California and southern Oregon. The oldest among them is 2,200 years; 
the tallest measures 113 meters (370 feet). Their cousins, the giant sequoias 
(Sequoiadendron giganteum), live in the harsher climate of the Sierra Nevada mountains. 
These trees are more massive and live even longer. Although all redwoods are valuable 
natural resources, the coast redwoods are the focus of this Newton's Apple
segment. <p>

Like all trees, the coast redwoods have developed a highly successful root, trunk, and 
leaf system using air, water, and sunlight to live and reproduce. The shallow roots 
of the redwood can spread laterally over 75 meters (250 feet) as they collect and send 
water and minerals to the leaves. The leaves, in turn, create food through 
<I><A NAME="photo">photosynthesis</A></I> and send the nutrients back down through the trunk to the
roots.  <p>

The unusual characteristics of the redwood's trunk have enabled it to survive the 
centuries. The outer layer of a tree's trunk, or bark, is made up of dead cells. In 
redwoods, the bark is fibrous and thick, often measuring 30.5 centimeters (one foot). 
The thickness of the bark and its lack of <I><A NAME="resin">resin</A></I> help redwoods resist damage from

redwood? <p>

<H2><A NAME="main activity">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></H2>
<li>  a tree
<li>  ruler
<li>  tape measure
<li>  graph paper and pencil
<li>  twine measuring at least 100 meters (328')
<li>  several friends</ul><p>
<ul>
<li>  Select a tree to measure. 
<li>  Standing near your tree, press the ruler horizontally against the bridge of your 
nose, holding the ruler at its end.
<li>  Flip the ruler vertically, making sure to keep it at a distance of one ruler's 
length from your face.
<li>  Walk backward until the top of the ruler lines up with the top of the tree. 
<li>  Using the tape measure, calculate the distance between the tree and where you are 
standing. Add the measurement of your height to this calculation to find the 
approximate height of your tree.
<li> Make a graph of the redwood tree, your tree, and your friends' trees.
<li>  To visualize your graph, try this. Find an open area outside. Using twine, measure 
the length of the 65-meter redwood. First measure the length of your stride. Have a 
friend hold the ball of twine. Holding the other end of the twine, count your strides 
to measure the length for the redwood. Once you reach 65 meters, have a friend stand 
in that spot.  Follow the same directions to measure the length of your tree. Imagine 
your tree next to a giant redwood as you compare the two lengths of
twine.</ul><p>

<A NAME="try this"></A>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Trees send water through their trunks and out their leaves. Fill two cups with the 
same amount of water, mark the water levels, and tape paper covers over the cups' 
tops. Take two twigs, removing the leaves from one. Place one twig in each cup, poking 
the stems through the covers. Wrap a plastic bag around a few leaves to catch the 
moisture. Which cup loses the most water?<p>

<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Water comes up through the tree's trunk and out to the leaves. Does moisture evaporate 
through a conifer's needles as it does through leaves of a broadleaf tree? Find out. 
Tie a small plastic bag over the needles of a conifer. Do the same for a broadleaf 
tree. Check the bags after a few hours and observe the amount of moisture in each bag.
<p>
<h3><img src="leaf.gif">TRY THIS!</h3>
Take a trip to a lumberyard. Collect various wood samples, including a piece of 
redwood. Interview a lumberyard employee about the desirability and availability of 
redwood. Finally, identify the woods and compare their characteristics. Try driving a 
nail through each wood sample and compare and contrast the densities of each sample.

<p>

Sneezing, coughing, and blinking are simple reflexes. But they aren't as simple
as they seem. <P>
It's true that reflexes have a simple definition. They're involuntary actions or
movements that occur in response to a stimulus. And you may not think that much
goes on when you yawn, for example. But you might be surprised.<P>
Each reflex action can involve countless complex communications and intricate
coordination among nerve cells called neurons. These neurons are found in the
<A HREF="#two">central nervous system</A>, which includes your brain and spinal cord, and the
<A HREF="#five">peripheral nervous system</A>, which includes all the nerves that reach your body's
extremities. Not all neurons are alike, however. <p>
<ul>
<li>Sensory (or <A HREF="#one">afferent</A>) neurons carry messages to the brain and spinal
cord.<BR>
<li>Motor (or <A HREF="#three">efferent</A>) neurons carry messages away from the brain and
spinal cord. They tell muscles to contract or relax and spur glands into action. <BR>
<li><A HREF="#four">Interneurons</A> send messages between nerve cells within the brain,
spinal cord, and the periphery. These busy characters make up over 99 percent of the more than 10 billion neurons in our nervous system.<P>
</ul>
But why is the brain involved in reflex actions at all? As part of the nervous
system, the brain has specialized functions, only some of which control thought
or voluntary movement. The brain stem, for example, manages involuntary reflexes
such as breathing and keeping our balance. We don't consciously decide to do
these things. But a part of our brain is still involved.<P>
Reflexes serve as primitive responses that protect our bodies from danger and
help us adjust to our surroundings. We cough, for example, when an irritant
enters our windpipe and we need to expel it through our mouth.  We sneeze when we
need to clear our nasal air passages of irritants and allergens. We blink when
danger threatens the sensitive tissues of the eye and when we need to moisten and
clean the cornea. (This reflex occurs 900 times an hour!) We yawn when nerves in
the brain stem find there's too much carbon dioxide in the blood. A yawn makes
the muscles in our mouth and throat contract and forces our mouth wide open,
allowing us to expel carbon dioxide and take in a large amount of oxygen-rich
air.<P>
Without these reflex actions, we would be unable to survive. So even though they
may be simple, these reflexes are a really big deal.<P>

<font size=+2>Connections</font><p>

1.  What other reflex actions do we have? How do they protect us? Which reflexes
can we control more than others?<BR>
2.  If you could design new reflexes for yourself, what would they be?<P>

How fast do your nerves send and receive messages? Involuntary reflexes are very
fast, traveling in milliseconds. The nerve impulses in the neurons that control
these reflexes travel an express route. In fact, the fastest impulses reach 520

takes a much longer route. See just how fast your brain and nerves respond to

<p>
Although rock climbing does not draw large crowds, it claims an annual growth
rate of 50%, with women accounting for one-quarter of all climbers. Before
beginning, however, climbers should get professional instruction so they
understand how to use ropes to protect themselves against the forces of <A HREF="#gravity"><i>gravity</i></A>. 
<p>
Climbers choose nylon ropes because they stretch and absorb the shock of a fall.
Good climbing ropes will stretch to double their original length before breaking
and have a breaking strength of over three tons of force. Ropes are used in two
ways. In "top roping" (the safest method), climbers fix webbing to an immovable
object at the top of a cliff--usually a tree or a rock. They attach the webbing to
a <A HREF="#carabiner"><i>carabiner</i></A>. Then they pass a rope through the carabiner, letting the two ends
dangle down the side of the cliff. One end is tied to the climber. The other is
tied to and held by a person at the bottom, who keeps the rope taut to stop a
fall.
<p>
Sometimes top roping is impossible because the climb is longer than one-half a
rope length or because the climbers don't have access to the top of the cliff to
fix the webbing. In that case, someone must "lead climb" and place <A HREF="#protect"><i>protection</i></A> in
the cracks in the rock. The rope is clipped into the protection. The second
climber <A HREF="#belay"><i>belays</i></A> the lead climber.
<p>
Biomechanics are crucial to climbing. Bones, joints, and muscles combine to
provide wedges and levers--all the simple tools necessary to make it to the top.
The most sophisticated climbing "gadget" is the human hand. Hand jams allow
climbers to grab holds in seemingly impossible places. Climbers also manipulate
their <A HREF="#center"><i>center of mass</i></A> by working their bodies away from the rock face. This puts
more force onto their feet. High-tech climbing shoes make good use of that force.
Their rubber soles conform to the surface of the rock and create enough friction
(or stickiness) to hold on to steep angles. 
<p>
Climbing techniques put a variety of forces to work. In "face climbing," the most
common technique, climbers pull down on handholds and push up on footholds to
advance up the rock. By keeping their weight balanced over their feet, the
climbers remain stable. In "stemming," climbers push their legs outward against
the two opposing rock faces. Their outward push forces their shoes into the walls
and the shoes generate an upward frictional force which opposes gravity and
allows the climbers to ascend.
<p>
Climbing is basically applied physics. Grace, rhythm, balance, concentration, and
flexibility count more than strength.  Although incorrect techniques, bad
weather, and misuse of equipment can produce some dangerous situations, climbing
is a safe sport when proper procedures are followed.

<p>
Friction is the force that causes resistance when we try to slide one surface
over another. Friction helps us walk, run, and jump. Without it, a climber would
have a very difficult time going up a steep slope.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/1101.gif" hspace=10>
<B>Materials</B><ul>
<li> a few bricks
<li> a board or piece of plywood
<li> two sheets of sandpaper of different grade
<li> blocks of wood
<li> gym shoes
</ul>
<OL>
<LI> Pull a brick across the board three times, turning the brick each time to use
a different face. Is the friction the same for each face?

<LI> Now put one brick on top of another and pull them both across the board. What
happens? When you pull the two bricks, you will need to exert twice the effort
you needed to pull one brick. Try this with wooden blocks or other materials.
You'll find that the ratio of friction to load is the same for identical bodies.
It varies, depending on the mass and the surface characteristics of the material.

<LI> Place an object on the board and raise one end of the board. Eventually the
object will slide off the board. The higher you can raise the board before the
object slides off it, the greater the friction force is between the object and
the board.

<LI> Glue sandpaper to a board. Place shoes and other objects on the sandpaper.
Raise one end of the board and notice how high you can raise it before the shoes
slide off the board. The higher you can raise the board, the greater the
friction. Find out whose shoes have the highest friction.

<LI> Place the sole of one of the gym shoes in water and then try to pull each shoe
across the inclined board. How does the water affect the movement?</OL>
<p>
<B>Questions</B><ol>
<li> Look at the soles of several types of gym shoes. What sort of friction devices
have been built in?
<li> Friction creates heat. A rope running through the hands of a climber creates
heat. What other examples can you think of where friction creates heat?</ol>

Climbers climb on different types of rock: quartzite, limestone, sandstone,
granite. How do these rock formations differ?  How might that affect climbing
techniques? Find some exposed bedrock near your house. Examine the rocks and
holes. 
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
To help you understand a belay, wrap a medium thick rope (over 1/4" thick) two
times around a flagpole and have a one-way tug of war. One person should try to
pull the rope with both hands while the other person holds the rope with one
finger. The friction of the cord wrapped around the flagpole acts as a belay. The
belay increases the force exerted by one finger so much that the person pulling
on the rope with both hands is unlikely to be able to pull much rope at all. This
is how a belayer can counteract the large forces generated in a rock climbing
fall.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
Climbers are constantly exposed to the elements and must devise their own
protection. What does this involve? Focus on different types of adaptation, such
as clothing, bedding, and sun protection.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
Some mountaineering or outdoor stores have rock walls and many cities are
acquiring rock gyms. Find out whether there are any climbing areas near you and
take a field trip to learn more about rock climbing principles.

The human hand is our prime manipulative tool. It has an opposable thumb, which
gives us a great deal of dexterity. Think of the ways you use your hands as
tools. Tape one of your thumbs to the side of your hand to immobilize it. You'll
soon understand why the thumb makes your hand such an effective tool.

<h1>Satellite Technology</h1>
What will future satellite technology bring?<br>
<hr>
</center>
Peggy gets an explanation of satellite technology from Isaac Newton himself.<br>
Segment length:  4:37<p>
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</h4></a>
<p>
The post-World War II era ushered in the development of satellites and their
launch systems, and with it, the communications revolution.  In 1958, the
"space race" began when the Soviets launched Sputnik.  The first American
communications satellite, Telstar 1, was launched in 1962.  It could handle 600
telephone conversations simultaneously.  Today, over 200 international
communications satellites, similar to the Intelstat VI family, can carry 33,000
telephone calls at once.  This capability will again be exceeded with the
development of future satellites.<p>
Isaac Newton first discovered how <a href="#two">gravity</a> keeps satellites in <a href="#three">orbit</a> when he
observed how the moon orbits the earth.  Any object, be it the moon or a
communications satellite, is pulled toward the earth by the force of gravity.
But, if it is moving fast enough and is moving perpendicular to the pull of
gravity, it falls in a curved path and circles the earth.  Although it's always
falling, it stays in orbit.  (It's similar to a ball on a string:  if you swing
it fast enough, it will travel in a circle around your hand.)  If a satellite
does not move fast enough, it eventually spirals closer and closer to the earth
and burns up in the earth's atmosphere.<p>
Satellites are sent into space and placed in orbit in one of two ways.  The
first way is with an expendable rocket that launches the satellite out of the
earth's atmosphere.  A smaller rocket attached to the satellite then places the
satellite into the proper orbit.  The second way of getting a satellite into
space is on board a space shuttle.  After the shuttle reaches a low earth
orbit, astronauts release the satellite.  The shuttle backs away and a transfer
engine on the satellite places it in its proper orbit.
<p>
Satellites orbit the earth primarily in four ways:  polar orbits,
geosynchronous orbits, low earth orbits, and molniya orbits.
In a polar orbit, a satellite orbits the earth from pole to pole.  It covers
different parts of the earth as the earth turns beneath it.  This orbit is used
for observing the weather and mapping earth resources.
Most communications satellites are put into a geosynchronous orbit.  This kind
of orbit positions a satellite over the equator; the satellite orbits the earth
at the same speed as the earth is turning, giving the satellite the appearance
of being stationary.
Low earth orbits vary with the type of satellites and their primary purposes.
The uses of satellites in low earth orbit may range from scientific research to
surveillance.
Molniya orbits are highly <a href="#one">elliptical</a> and are used primarily by Soviet
communications satellites.<p>
Satellites will continue to grow in popularity, complexity, and uses, limited
only by the imaginations of those involved in the technology.
<p>
<h4>Connections</h4><p>
1.  What do satellites allow you to see "live" on TV that you would not see
otherwise?  What are some current events that you have seen on TV either as
they happened or shortly after?<br>
2.  Why do communications-satellite orbits need to be so far from the earth?<p>

 Main Activity</h4></a>
<p>
<center>
<h1>Digital Art</h1>
Combine art and science in this communications experiment.<br>
</center>
<p>
You will learn how digital images are made, and how signals are sent and
received.<p>
<b>Materials</b><br>
<ul>
<li>graph paper, 5 squares to the inch OR plain paper on which you have drawn
lines vertically and horizontally, creating 5 squares to the inch <br>
<li>pencils<p>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Pair your students; one will be the "sender," the other the "receiver."<p>
<li>Distribute graph paper to each student, and have each student draw a 10" x
10" square on the paper.<p>
<li>Within this 10" square, have the sender draw a simple picture.  The
receiver should not be able to see what the sender has drawn.<p>
<li>Direct the sender to "read" her picture to the receiver, using a digital
code:  If a square is blank, the sender says, "Zero"; if the square is filled
in, the sender says, "One."  Using this code, start with the top row and read
from left to right.<p>
<li>The receiver, upon hearing this code, transfers the information to his 10"
square on his graph paper.<p>
<li>At the end of the first row, the sender says, "End row 1," and repeats this
at the end of each row.<p>
<li>At the end of the 10th row, look at the picture on the receiver's paper.
Check the results to see how accurate the transfer was.<p>
<li>Change roles and repeat steps 1 through 7.  Try this activity using larger
or more complex drawings.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  What was the most difficult part of the activity to do?<p>
2.  Can you think of a better way to transmit and receive information?<p>
3.  Describe how a digital image is formed based on your experiment.  <p>
4.  Can you figure out how the information is coded electronically?  (Hint:
Using a light switch on the wall, assign a number to the switch when it is on.
Assign a different number when the switch is off.)<p>
5.  What are some other devices or systems that communicate this way using 1s
and 0s?<p>

Find out about space laws, specifically those governing geosynchronous orbits.
(This kind of orbit is highly preferred, and for that reason, a branch of the
United Nations governs the placement of satellites in this area of space.)  How
is geosynchronous space divided up?  How is it determined who gets what?  What
if two sponsors wanted the same area in space?  How could a conflict be
resolved?<p>
<p>
<p>
<a name="5"><img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This"></a>
<br clear=left>
Find out about the parts of an electromagnetic wave:  wavelength,
height/amplitude, frequency, cycle, nodes, etc.  Use a piece of rope (15- to
20-feet long) to demonstrate how electromagnetic waves are generated.  Lay the
rope out on the floor and have two people hold each end.  Have one person move
the rope side to side in quick motions; you have generated "waves,"
specifically, transverse waves.  Stop the motion and the waves will stop in
their form along the floor.  Measure the wavelength, amplitude, and frequency.
Sketch what you see.<p>

<b>Try these experiments and observe what happens. Guess why it happens and compare your results to those on the back of the page.</b>       
<b>Now you can try Newtons Apple experiments at home!</b><p>


<img src="Images/tryit1.jpeg"><p>
Find a small-necked, corked bottle and balance an ice cube on top of it. Cut a 15-inch piece of thin, strong wire and tie a hammer to each end. Balance the wire across the middle of the ice cube. What do you think will happen? Try it!
<p>
<center><img src="Images/tryit1p.jpeg"></center><p>
<img src="Images/tryit2.jpeg"><p>
Tie one end of a long piece of string to the middle of a matchstick. Pull the other end of the string up through the hole in the center of an LP record (so the matchstick is centered underneath the hole). Try to swing the record back and forth like a pendulum in smooth, even movements. Now give the record a spin. What will happen when you try to swing the record again? Try it!
<p>
<center><img src="Images/tryit2p.jpeg"></center><p>
<img src="Images/tryit3.jpeg"><p>
Poke a hole in the bottom left hand corner of each of the four faces of a half-gallon, paper milk carton. Poke an additional hole in the top flap of the carton and tie a string through it.  Suspend the carton from the string. Cover the holes with your fingers and pour water into the carton. What will happen when you remove your fingers from the holes? Try it!
<p>
<center><img src="Images/tryit3p.jpeg"></center><p>
<img src="Images/tryit4.jpeg"><p>
Carefully break off the small end of four eggs and pour out the insides. Wind a piece of cellophane tape around the center of each eggshell. Cut through the center of the tape to make four dome-shaped shells (discard the broken end of each shell). Lay the four domes on a table with the cut sides down arranged in the shape of a rectangle. Next, guess how many telephone books you can lay on top of the shells before they break. Try it!
<p>
<center><img src="Images/tryit4p.jpeg"></center><p>
<img src="Images/tryit5.jpeg"><p>
Light a candle and hold a cylindrical container in front of it (e.g. small oatmeal or salt package). Take a deep breath and blow against the other side of the container, keeping your mouth even with the flame of the candle. Can you blow out the candle? Try it!
<p>
<center><img src="Images/tryit5p.jpeg"></center><p>
<img src="Images/tryit6.jpeg"><p>
Using a nail, make five holes in the side of an aluminum can. The holes should be made close to the base of the can and should be spaced 1/4 apart. Hold the can under a kitchen faucet or hose and fill it with water. Pinch the streams of water together with your thumb and forefinger. What happens? 
<p>
<center><img src="Images/tryit6p.jpeg"></center><p>
<p><p>

<img src="Images/tryit7.jpeg"><p>
<b>How can the wire cut right through the ice cube without breaking it into two pieces?</b><br>  
The pressure of the wire causes the ice to melt beneath it. The wire sinks easily through the melted ice, while the ice above the wire, which is no longer subjected to pressure, refreezes. This scientific principle also applies to ice skating. The pressure that your skates exert on ice causes a layer of water to form under the blades, creating a slick and slippery surface for sliding.
<p>
<b>What happens to the carton?</b><br> 
Newtons Third Law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Water shoots out the holes, and pushes back on the carton with equal force. A turbine is formed as the energy of the moving liquid is converted into rotational energy.
<p>
<b>What makes the record swing smoothly?</b><br>
Gyroscopic inertia is the property of a rotating object to resist any force which would change its axis of rotation. Once the record is set spinning at an angle perpendicular to the string, it will resist any forces (such as gravity) that try to change that angle. 
<p>
<b>How can fragile egg shells support heavy books?</b><br>
Archeseven those made of eggshellsare strong because they exert horizontal as well as vertical forces to resist the pressure of heavy loads. The crown of an eggshell can support heavy books because the weight is distributed evenly along the structure of the egg.
<p>
<b>Why are you able to blow the candle out?</b><br>
The Coanda Effect is the tendency of a fluid to follow the wall contour of a curved surface. In this case, air acts like a fluid and follows the contour of the round container. When the streams meet on the other side, they combine to blow out the candle. 
<p>
<b>Why do the streams knot together?</b><br>
The streams of water are held together by the waters stickiness, or surface tension. Surface tension is the tendency of the surface of a liquid to behave as though covered with a skin. This is due to the cohesive forces between the molecules at and near the surface.

<i>Where does sewage go?</i></center></p><hr>

Peggy takes a journey down her kitchen drain to explore the <A href="#sewe">sewer</A> system.<p>

<UL>
<LI>Where does our drinking water come from?  
<LI>What happens to waste water and sewage after it goes down the drain?  
<LI>Why is it important to treat wastewater before it returns to the environment?  
<LI>Does all <A href="#slud">sludge</A> need to be destroyed, or can it serve a purpose?
</UL>
<hr>
<center><B>Discussion</B></center><p>
Clean water is one of our most precious natural resources.  Yet every time we flush a toilet, pour oil down the drain or clean with strong household chemicals, we contaminate our supply.  Before wastewater can be released into our waterways, it must go through a process called sewage treatment to be decontaminated.
<p>
A network of underground pipes collects the millions of gallons of waste material created by a community.  When the waste and water arrive at the sewage treatment plant, large objects are filtered out with screening devices.  The flow of the wastewater is then slowed to allow the sludge to settle.  Oils and grease are skimmed off the surface of the effluent sewage.  The effluent is then treated with chlorine to kill specific <A href="#micr">microorganisms</A> that cause disease before the water is returned to the waterways.  This process is called primary treatment.  Unfortunately, this treatment only removes about 50 percent of the pollutants found in wastewater and most sewage treatment plants must use a second stage of treatment.
<p>
In secondary treatment, <A href="#effl">effluent</A> and sludge are exposed to oxygen in an aeration tank.  Here, valuable microorganisms consume the organic matter and even some of the poisonous or toxic materials.  Then chlorine is added before the water is released into the waterways.
<p>
Sludge from both primary and secondary treatments is pumped into oxygen-free digestion tanks and then dried.  This processed sludge is often used as a fertilizer or as fuel.  Sludge contaminated with toxic material must be incinerated or buried in a landfill.
<p>
One way or the other, water returns to the environment.  That is why sewage treatment is so important.
<p>
<hr><h3><center><B>Things to Talk About</B></h3></center><p>
<ol>
<li>What are the potential dangers if waste water and sewage are not properly treated?<br>
<li>Did you know that by turning off the tap while you brush your teeth, you can save one to two gallons of water?  How else can you conserve water at home, school, or work?
<br><li>During the making of the Newton's Apple segment on sewers, we learned that a small car engine was once found in the water in a waste treatment plant.  How do you think the engine got there?  
<br><li>Where does your drinking water come from?  What do you now put down the drain, that you might think twice about, knowing you may have to drink that water after treatment?</ol><p>

<p>

Have you ever tried one of those motion <A HREF="#six">simulator</A> rides at an amusement park? How
do the designers manage to fool you into thinking you're on an incredible
journey?<P>
For the answer, look at how your own eyes play tricks on you. Anthropologists
believe humans developed <A HREF="#five">peripheral vision</A> to survive in the wild-we needed to
see predators out of the corners of our eyes. Designers of simulators and <A HREF="#seven">virtual
reality</A> rides make use of this to create illusions. When the lights go off, your
seat moves in conjunction with peripheral images projected around you.<P>
Ride designers also take advantage of our ability to sense the distance of
objects as we move. Our eyes perceive nearby objects moving more than objects in
the distance. This visual cue to depth is called <A HREF="#four">motion parallax</A>. Sixty years
ago, Disney Studios developed a camera to make cartoon characters look real. They
placed several layers of <A HREF="#one">celluloid</A> drawings at different distances from the
camera lens. When the layer of objects in front of a character was moved to the
right and the layer behind to the left, the viewer's eyes sensed the characters
moving in three dimensions. Today, designers use motion parallax in rides.<P>
Another visual trick involves persistence of vision. Your brain retains an image
for about one-tenth of a second after the image is gone. If you see 10 still
pictures per second, your brain will tell you that you're seeing moving pictures.
When you watch a movie, you're seeing at least 24 individual pictures per second.
<P>
Even your ears can be fooled. In your inner ear, three semicircular canals
contain fluid and tiny hairs connected to nerve endings of the auditory nerve.
Rapid movement causes the fluid to move back and forth through these canals,
bending the hairs. This triggers the nerve endings, sending electrical signals to
the brain that demand you move your eyes and head to adjust to rotating
movements. <P>
Some nerve endings are very sensitive to gravity, helping the brain know what
postion your body is in. On a ride that uses <A HREF="#three">hydraulic lifts</A> to move your seat or
that spins your body, your inner ear adjusts to provide a sense of orientation
and movement. After you've stopped moving, the <A HREF="#two">Coriolis illusion</A> causes you to
feel like you're still spinning for awhile. That's why it's hard to walk-your
brain is trying to adjust to the spinning or abrupt movements rather than the
ground.<P>
<font size=+2>Connections</font><p>
1.  What makes your favorite ride scary? <BR>
2.  Nerves in your ears that are sensitive to gravity send messages to your brain
about your body's position. Do you think astronauts in space would feel better
floating or attached to a corner of the spacecraft?<P>

<p>
<center>
<font size=+5>Eye Witness</font>
<br>
Look out of the corner of your eye to see why you need both rods and cones.<br>
</center>
<BR>
<P>
<img align=right hspace-5 src="illustrations/simrde.gif">
Your inner eyeball is lined with a light-sensitive membrane called the retina,
which is connected to the brain by the optic nerve. The retina has lots of
cells-120 million rods and 8 million cones. The periphery of the retina contains
rods and does not see images clearly but sees motion and where things are. The
fovea of the retina contains mostly cones, and you use it to see what something
is. Try this activity to see how these two areas of your retina differ.<P>
Materials<BR>
<ul>
<li>partner<BR>
<li>chair<BR>
<li>several objects of different colors<P>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Ask your partner to sit on the chair and look straight ahead. You should
stand behind the chair.<BR>
<li>Raise two fingers and, starting from behind your friend's head, slowly bring
your hand into view.<BR>
<li>Ask your partner to say &quot;stop&quot; as soon as she or he sees your hand.
Stop moving your hand, and ask how many fingers you have raised. The number will
probably be wrong because the periphery only sees the movement of the hand-the
fovea can see how many fingers.<BR>
<li>Keep moving your hand forward until your partner can count the fingers
correctly.<BR>
<li>Switch roles, and see how you do.<BR>
<li>Switch again. This time, as your partner stares straight ahead, slowly bring
a colored object forward from behind that person's head.<BR>
<li>Tell him or her to say &quot;stop&quot; as soon as he or she sees the object.
Ask what color it is. The rods of the periphery see motion, but not color. Only
the cones, found in the fovea, can see color.<BR>
<li>Continue moving the object forward until your partner can tell you the
correct color.<P>
</ol>
Questions<BR>
1.  The rods in your retina see movement better in the dark, but they don't see
as clearly as the cones. You think you are focusing on the pattern, but your eyes
may be moving enough to make the pattern seem to move. Think about the scary
things you may have imagined seeing in the dark. Does this help explain why you
saw them? <P>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>

Get a book of drawings by M. C. Escher. Study the illusions in the drawings. Do
you see connections between the animals that turn into other animals, or people
that seem to be suddenly walking up the down stairs, or down the up stairs? Try
to create a pictorial illusion of your own. (First you might have to copy one of
his.)<P>
Test your peripheral vision and find your blind spot with the apple and the 3M
logo on opposite ends of this page. Turn the page so that the apple is on the
left and the 3M logo is on the right. Hold the page in front of your face; your
nose should face the middle of the page. Cover your left eye with your hand and
stare at the apple. Slowly move the page closer to your face. At some point you
will no longer see the red 3M. Next, cover your right eye and repeat the
exercise. Now, hold the page about one foot in front of you. Cover one eye and
focus on the apple. Move the page from right to left and back to find your blind
spot, the place where the 3M logo disappears.<P>

<center><h1>SLINKY PHYSICS</h1>
<i>How Do Toys Work?</i></center><p><hr>

David discovers that the slinky and many other toys aren't as simple as they may
look.<p>
<ul>
<li>Who invented the Slinky?  
<li>How does it walk down stairs?  
<li>Is it as simple as it looks?  
<li>What other kinds of tricks can a Slinky perform?  
<li>Are there other toys that work the same way? </ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
When the Slinky's inventor Richard James, a naval engineer, and his wife decided
to demonstrate their new toy at 
Gimbels Department Store in Philadelphia in the early 1940s, they feared that no
one would buy it because it was so 
simple.  They were so worried they gave a close friend a dollar to buy one.  An
hour and a half after the first 
demonstration, they had sold a total of  400 Slinkys!<p>  

The Slinky, whose design has been modified only once to crimp the ends for
safety, remains the same today as it did at 
Gimbels.  Not only is the Slinky an excellent toy, its action also demonstrates a
variety of physical forces and 
principles.<p>

The Slinky, like all objects, tends to resist change in its motion.  Because of
this <A href="#inert">inertia</a>, if it were placed at the 
top of the stairs it would stay at rest without moving at all.  At this point it
has potential or stored energy.  But 
once it is started down the stairs and gravity affects it, the potential energy
is converted to the energy of motion or
kinetic energy and the Slinky gracefully tumbles coil by coil down the stairs.<p>

The physical properties of the slinky determine how quickly it moves under the
influence of gravity.  Although its 
movement may look simple, from a scientific point of view the motion is quite
complex.  As the slinky moves down the 
steps, energy is transferred along its length in a <A
href="#longw">longitudinal</a> or compressional wave, which resembles a sound
wave 
that travels through a substance by transferring a pulse of energy to the next
molecule.  How quickly the wave moves 
depends on the spring constant and the mass of the metal.  Other factors, such as
the length of the slinky, the 
diameter of the coils and the height of the step must be considered to completely
understand why a slinky moves as it 
does.<p>

James originally developed the Slinky for the Navy as an anti-vibration device
for ship instruments.  When the Slinky 
failed to work for the Navy, it became one of the most successful toys of all
time!<p>

<hr>
<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>Why can't a Slinky go upstairs?  Would it work on a circular staircase?  Is
there any difference between plastic 
and metal Slinkys?  
<li>What are all the factors that might make one slinky move faster than another?
 Which factors are the most 
important?  How would you test your answers?</ol>

<B><A Name="longw">Longitudinal Wave</a></B>--A wave in which the vibration is in
the same direction as that in which the wave is traveling, 
rather than at right angles to it.  Sound waves are longitudinal waves.<p>
<B>Transverse Wave</B>--A wave in which the vibration is at right angles to the
direction in which the wave is traveling.  
Waves in the stretched strings of musical instruments, upon the surfaces of
liquids, and the electromagnetic waves 
which make up radio waves and light are transverse.<p>
<B><A Name="inert">Inertia</a></B>--A property, or quality, that tends to keep
objects in motion in a straight line, or to keep objects at rest 
motionless, unless either one is acted upon by an outside force.<p>  
<B>Friction</B>--The force that acts when two surfaces rub against each other. 
Friction always acts to slow movement and if 
no other force is applied, it will bring motion to a stop.<p>

<B>Let 'em Roll</B><p>
Find out how you can convert potential energy into kinetic energy!<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
You can overcome an object's inertia and watch physical forces act on it as it
moves.  You will also be able to create 
energy transfers.<p>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Empty spool of thread
<li>Small rubber band about the same length as the spool
<li>Metal washer
<li>Tack or pin 
<li>Match stick
<li>Paper
<li>Pencil</ul>
<p>
1.  Slip the rubber band through the hole of the empty spool.<p>
2.  Attach the end of the rubber band to the end of the spool with the tack or
pin.<p> 
3.  Pull the loose end of the rubber band through the metal washer.<p>
4.  Slip the match stick through the open end of the rubber band.  Wind the
rubber band around the match stick several 
times until there is no slack left in the rubber band.<p>
5.  Let go of the match stick and watch what happens!<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  Does the number of twists in the rubber band affect how far the model goes? 
What would happen if you used a longer
rubber band?<p>
2.  Can you modify the design of your toy so that it can travel faster?  Could
you design it to go around corners?<p> 
3.  What happens if you run the toy on a sloped surface?  Does this affect the
speed of the toy?<p>

<li>Why do their space vehicles look identical to NASA's?  
<li>How many different solutions to scientific challenges are there?  
<li>What might the next space missions explore?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Achievements in space exploration have had an impact on science and technology
around the world.  The study and 
exploration of space is a quest for excellence and adventure, as well as a thirst
for unlocking the secrets of the 
unknown.<p>

The first decade of space exploration was marked by many Soviet and American
firsts.  In October 1957, the Soviets 
launched Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite to circle the Earth.  A month
later, Sputnik II rocketed spaceward 
carrying a dog, Laika, the first space traveller to orbit our planet.  In
following years, dozens of American and Soviet
satellites were launched, with several probes exploring even more distant regions
of space.<p>

The real challenge of space exploration was to rocket people into space, and then
toward the Moon. The first human to 
orbit the Earth was Soviet <A href="#cosmo">cosmonaut</a>, Yuri Gagarin.  He flew
in the Vostok I spaceship for one circuit of the globe in 
April 1961.  During the 1960s, many Soviet cosmonauts and American astronauts
mastered space flight.  Only U.S. 
astronauts achieved the goal of landing on the faraway Moon.<p>  

In 1975, The Soviet Union and the United States worked together to link their
respective spaceships above Earth  the 
U.S. Apollo and the Soviet Soyuz 19  a historic first in space cooperation.<p>

Today, U.S. space shuttles routinely take astronauts on voyages in Earth's orbit
to experiment in <A href="#microg">microgravity</a>.  The 
Soviet Union uses their Space Station Mir to study the effects of long durations
of weightlessness on the cosmonaut 
space travellers.  Built of many modules, the Mir was first launched in 1986.  On
one expedition aboard the Mir, the 
cosmonaut team of Musa Manarov and Vladimir Titov spent a total of 366 days, 18
hours and seven minutes in space  the 
current world's record.<p>

In recent times, the Soviets have opened up their space program to more and more
cooperation with other nations.  They 
also want to commercialize their space program to help reduce its cost.  In
upcoming years, U.S. astronauts and Soviet 
cosmonauts are expected to once again fly together in space, forging friendships
that could lead to a joint mission to 
the distant dunes of Mars.<p>

<B>Toys In Space</B><p>
How does gravity affect the operation of toys?<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
You will observe the physics of selected toys on Earth, and predict the physics
of the same toys in a microgravity 
environment like that of the space shuttle.<p>

Space travellers have to learn to live, work and play in a weightless
environment.  In April 1985, the Space Shuttle 
Discovery transported 11 familiar toys into the weightlessness of space for the
Toys In Space Project.  This project 
was known simply as TOYS (Testing Of Youth Science).  The TOYS Program included a
selection of toys like those below.  
Find as many of these toys as possible.<p>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Toys In Space video (available from NASA CORE, see resource section)
<li>Paper airplane 
<li>Yoyo 
<li>Set of ball and jacks 
<li>Slinky 
<li>Magnetic marbles 
<li>Wheelo 
<li>Wind-up car 
<li>Paddleball 
<li>Metal top 
<li>Gyroscope 
<li>Flipping mouse ("Rat Stuff")</ul>  
<p>
1.  Work with each toy to see how it responds to gravity and motion.  Try
different actions with each toy like flying 
the plane or pushing the car backward and forward.<p>
2.  Write down your predictions of what you think would happen if you played with
these toys aboard the Space Shuttle 
Discovery.<p>
3.  Match your predictions with what happened on the "Toys In Space" video.<p>
4.  Talk about the reasons these activities might be valuable to space
exploration.<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  How might you change each toy to work better in space?<p>
2.  Will a toy car go backward in space?  If so, why?<p>
3.  What might happen if someone blew on the paper airplane in space?<p>

Compare the United States' Space Program with the Soviet Union's.  Find out about
both programs from 1957, when the 
Soviets launched Sputnik, and 1958, when NASA was formed, (including joint
ventures) to the present.  Create posters or 
pictorial time lines of space history to share with the class.<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Find out more about Star City.  Divide the class into two groups with one
representing the Soviets and the other the 
Americans.  What kind of questions would the cosmonauts and astronauts have for
each other?  What does each team like 
and dislike about the others' space program?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

The U.S. space program uses a lot of acronyms, or initials, to describe various
parts of the space program.  Do you 
know what these acronyms stand for?  How can you find out?

ESA?		MMU?
SRB?	EVA?
NASA?	UV?

Now make a list of more acronyms and their meanings.  Try to stump your friends
with your new list.<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Design your own spacesuit for a lunar mission.  First, find out about the space
suits of both the Americans and the 
Soviets.  Then split up into small groups to work on your own design.  Create
drawings and write a proposal of what you 
team's suit should look like.  Compare your design with the other teams and
discuss the differences.  What materials 
would build the best spacesuit?  What would make a good visor? What are important
human characteristics to keep in mind 
while designing the suit?  You may want to try to construct part of your suit,
like a glove, visor or boot.  Or, you 
might want to construct the entire suit in miniature.<p><p>

<p>

<UL> <LI>What effects do steroids have on the body? <LI>Are there
differences between natural steroids and manufactured steroids?
<LI>Would you risk your health to look better or be stronger?</UL>

<hr><center><B>Discussion</B></center><p> <A href="#anab">Anabolic</A>
steroids are male sex <A href="#horm">hormones</A>, or androgens, that promote
<A href="#musc">muscle</A> growth.  Your body produces them naturally, but they
can also be produced synthetically in a laboratory.  Both men and women produce these steroids.  Men produce
more steroids than women which tends to make men's muscles larger and
stronger.  Synthetic steroids are very similar to natural ones.<p>

Physicians can use anabolic steroids as a treatment for a variety of
conditions.  In very small and controlled doses, steroids can, among
other things, encourage people with muscle-wasting conditions to gain
weight, control certain breast cancers, treat blood disorders, heal
severe burns and relieve bone pain for people who have osteoporosis. Not
all steroids are made from hormones, nor are all hormones made of
steroids.  Physicians use another steroid called corticosteroid, also
known as <A href="#cort">cortisone</A>.  This catabolic steroid helps
reduce swellings in the body.<p>

Some people use anabolic steroids to build their muscles and increase
their endurance and speed.  Since the 1950s, some athletes have used
anabolic steroids to enhance their performance in competitions.  But
using steroids like this can cause side effects that are very serious.<p>

Steroids can cause liver disorders, stunted growth in children and
teenagers, personality changes, ulcerous acne and high cholesterol
levels.  Because steroids are made from synthetically-produced
testosterone, which imitates human sex hormones, they can also cause
wasting of the testicles, impotence and negative changes in sexuality. 
Sometimes, when steroids are used illegally, they are injected with
needles.  Sharing these needles can also pass on the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV, that causes the deadly disease AIDS.<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p> Before people can make rules and laws about
certain activities, they collect scientific data, evidence and opinions.
 Here's
your chance to state your opinion and compare it to other opinions at

disagree?  Record your answers and your friends' answers next to the
statements.<p>
<B><center>Sports Opinion Poll</B></center><p>
1.  All high schools
should have drug information programs for their athletes.<p>

Fitness and Sports test.<p><p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
 Just like smoking, overeating or using drugs,
steroids can be habit-forming.  Are you "hooked" on anything like chocolate,
soda, or television?  Whatever it is, try to stop doing it for one week.  What
does it feel like going without it?  Do you act differently?  Have you
replaced one habit with another?<p><p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430 height=15><br>
<p> How strong are you?  Some people who do not
have large or strong muscles can out perform people who do by using a little
technology.  Have two people with brooms stand about 60 cm apart with
the brooms held upright in front of their bodies.  Grab the two brooms
and try to pull them together.  The two people holding the brooms can
easily keep them apart.  Now tie a rope securely to one broom and wind
the rope around both brooms three or four times.  Be sure the rope does
not cross itself.  Ask the broom holders to try to keep the broom apart
while you pull on the rope.  What happens?  Were the broom holders
surprised?  Where else have you seen technology like this in use?<p><p>

<p>


<b>STREET SMART</b>
<p>
<h2><b>ANSWERS</b></h2>
<p>
<b>Stomach Growls?</b><br>
Air in your stomach moves around and bumps against the contents of your stomach. The sound resonates through your tissues and comes out sounding like a growl. When youre hungry, the resulting muscle contractions in your stomach increase the growling. It
s not like a dogs growl, but a hot dog or two would probably quiet it down.
<p>
<b>Sleep?</b><br>
Humans can go longer without food than without sleep. After several days without zs, insanity will set in. More than 10 days without sleep can be fatal. So get a good nights sleep!
<p>
<b>Cooties?</b><br>
Cooties are real organisms. They are a small, parasitic type of body louse similar to bird lice. They may even carry diseases like typhus. Thinking about cooties may give you the willies... but dont worry, willies arent real.
<p>
<b>Counting to a Billion?</b><br>
If you could count at the rate of one number each second, without stopping to eat or sleep, it would take nearly 32 years (or 384 months) to count to a billion.  So youd better get started!
<p>
<b>Sea Shell Sounds?</b><br>
It is the sound of the seayour own internal sea. Its actually the sound of your own blood coursing through your body that you hear.
<p>
<b>Edible Clothing?</b><br>
Your leather shoes. Shoe leather can actually provide enough nutrients to keep you alive for a short time. Talk about putting your foot in your mouth!

<h2><B><A NAME="insights">INSIGHTS & CONNECTIONS</A></B></h2>
<p>

You step outside on a crisp, clear night and gaze up at a sky full of sparkling stars.
You wonder which one to wish upon--they're all beautiful, but so far away.<p> 

Why not try wishing upon the star that's closest to our own planet Earth, the one we
see almost every day, the one that provides the light and heat we need to
survive?<p>

Our sun is just one of the 100 billion or so stars in our <A NAME="galaxy"><I>galaxy</I></A>, and there are billions of other galaxies in the universe. It may seem like the sun is close to us, 
but it's about 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) away. It's bigger than 
anything we can imagine--about 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) in diameter. 
A million Earths could fit inside it!<p>

The sun may be only one among billions of other stars in the universe, but it's the 
one that makes our life on Earth possible. How? By providing energy in many 
forms--solar power, fossil fuels, <A NAME="wave"><I>wave power</I></A>,
wind power. Without heat and light from  the sun, Earth would be just another dark, 
cold place in space where life as we know  it couldn't exist.<p> 

Where does the sun get all this energy? The sun's <A NAME="mass"><I>mass</I></A> is approximately 300,000 times  more than Earth's, and the
greater an object's mass, the greater the pressure at its  center. <A NAME="Charles's law"><I>Charles's law</I></A> 
tells us that when you squeeze--or compress--a gas, it gets hot. 
Most of the sun's mass is composed of hydrogen gas atoms, and about 100 years ago, 
physicists came up with the hypothesis that the sun's tremendous mass squeezed the 
<A NAME="hydrogen"><I>hydrogen</I></A> atoms until they ignited, releasing heat and light energy that eventually 
made it through space to us. Based on calculations of the mass of the sun, they 
figured that the sun would burn itself out in 6,000 years.<p>

<A NAME="evo"><I>Evolutionary biologists</I></A> and geologists knew from their own studies that life on Earth 
had been around much longer than 6,000 years, so the research continued. Decades 
later, a new hypothesis arose. Think about the hottest oven you can imagine, then 
turn up the temperature to about 25,000,000*F. That's how hot it gets in the center 
of the sun. At that temperature the hydrogen nuclei are moving so fast that when they 
crash into each other they stick together to form <A NAME="helium"><I>helium.</I></A>nuclei. <p>

The "fallout" from this crash is a tremendous amount of energy, released mainly in 
the form of heat and light. This reaction at the nuclear level is called <A NAME="nuclear"><I>nuclear fusion</I></A>. Scientists calculate that there is enough hydrogen in the sun to continue the 
fusion reaction and provide heat and energy for at least another five or six billion 
years.<p>
<UL>

<LI>What is the range of temperatures on Earth? Compare this with temperatures
on other  planets in our solar system. Do any other planets have a similar range that 
would allow for human survival?

<LI>What kinds of energy resources do we have on Earth? How are they related to
the sun?  Are any of our energy resources in danger of being used up? How can we conserve our 
energy resources?</UL>

Just how much bigger is the sun than Earth? And how far away is it? If you can't get 
a reservation on the next space shuttle flight, you'll have to go out to a field 
with a few friends and a few supplies to find the answers. You'll be amazed at what 
you observe when you compare the size of Earth with that of the sun and see how far 
you'd have to travel to get from one to the other.<p>

When we talk about the sun, we must use extremely large numbers. When working with 
very large or very small numbers, we use scientific notation, which means rewriting a 
number as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. For example, 
the sun's diameter, approximately 1,391,000 km, would be written as 1.391 x 106 km. 
Write some other large numbers in scientific notation.<hr>

Simulate the transfer of energy that takes place in a nuclear reaction and recycle 
sheets of paper at the same time! Get a group of at least six people to form a circle, 
each wearing safety glasses. Give each person two sheets of used paper 
(everyone should have the same size and weight of paper) and ask them to crumple the 
sheets to make two paper balls. Each person in the circle should hold a paper ball in 
each hand, and be ready to toss them in the air. The leader tosses (don't throw) a 
ball at one person. Whoever is hit by the ball quickly tosses the two balls she or he 
is holding at the group. The two people that person hits in turn toss their papers 
balls at the group. This continues until everyone has tossed their paper balls. The 
process should only take a few seconds. Observe how the tossing action speeds up as 
more people get involved!<p>

Sunlight looks colorless until it is refracted (bent) by water molecules in the air 
(raindrops), and displayed in the sky as a rainbow. There are many ways to capture 
white sunlight and create your own rainbow. Cut a slit that is 1 cm (3/8") wide and 
20 cm (8") long out of the middle of a sheet of opaque white paper or cardboard. Tape 
this sheet to the side of a clear glass of water so the sheet is standing vertically 
next to the glass. Place an 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of white paper on a table next to a 
sunlit window. Position the glass of water and the slit paper on top of the other 
sheet so that the paper with the slit is between the glass and the window. The room 
must be darkened except for a small beam of sunlight. As sunlight passes through the 
slit, it will be refracted by the water, creating a spectrum of colors that you'll 
see on the plain sheet of paper.<hr>

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
Have you ever wondered why food loses its flavor when you have a cold? It's not
your taste buds' fault. Blame your stuffed-up nose. Seventy to seventy-five
percent of what we perceive as taste actually comes from our sense of smell.
Taste buds allow us to perceive only bitter, salty, sweet, and sour flavors. It's
the <A HREF="#odor"><i>odor molecules</i></A> from food that give us most of our taste sensation.
<p>
When you put food in your mouth, odor molecules from that food travel through the
passage between your nose and mouth to <A HREF="#olfactory"><i>olfactory</i></a> <A HREF="#receptor">receptor</A> cells at the top of
your nasal cavity, just beneath the brain and behind the bridge of the nose. If
mucus in your <A HREF="#nasal"><i>nasal passages</i></A> becomes too thick, air and odor molecules can't
reach your olfactory receptor cells. Thus, your brain receives no signal
identifying the odor, and everything you eat tastes much the same. You can feel
the texture and temperature of the food, but no messengers can tell your brain,
"This cool, milky substance is chocolate ice cream." The odor molecules remain
trapped in your mouth. The pathway has been blocked off to those powerful
perceivers of smell--the olfactory bulbs.
<p>
Of all our senses, smell is our most primal. Animals need the sense of smell to
survive. Although a blind rat might survive, a rat without its sense of smell
can't mate or find food. For humans, the sense of smell communicates many of the
pleasures in life--the aroma of a pot roast in the oven, fresh-cut hay, a rose
garden. Smells can also signal danger, fear, or dread.
<p>
Although our sense of smell is our most primal, it is also very complex. To
identify the smell of a rose, the brain analyzes over 300 odor molecules. The
average person can discriminate between 4,000 to 10,000 different odor molecules.
Much is unknown about exactly how we detect and discriminate between various
odors. But researchers have discovered that an odor can only be detected in
liquid form. We breathe in airborne <A HREF="#molecule"><i>molecules</i></A> that travel to and combine with
receptors in nasal cells. The cilia, hairlike receptors that extend from cells
inside the nose, are covered with a thin, clear mucus that dissolves odor
molecules not already in vapor form. When the mucus becomes too thick, it can no
longer dissolve the molecules.
<p>
Animals depend on odors secreted from their bodies to communicate. For humans,
odors communicate a variety of messages, depending on the odor and the person
receiving it. The aroma of a baking apple pie sends one message when someone is
hungry and quite another when that person has just finished a six-course meal!

<h1><b>WHERE'S THE FLAVOR?</b></h1> 
<b>Challenge your taste buds and nose to a flavor competition.</b><pre>
</pre>
<h2><b><A NAME="MAIN">Main Activity</a></h2></b>
<p>
Test your classmates' senses of taste and smell to find out which sends the
clearest message to the brain.<p>

<b>Materials</b><ul>
<li> 6 small paper bags 
<li> 6 small scoops of mini jelly beans in three different flavors (lemon, grape, cherry) 
<li> marking pen
</ul>
<ol>
<li> With the marking pen, identify the bags as either taste or smell bags. Write
"taste #1," "taste #2," and "taste #3" on three of the sacks and "smell #1,"
"smell #2," and "smell #3" on the other three sacks.
<p>
<li> Divide jelly beans among the bags so that you have a "taste" bag and a "smell"
bag for each of the three flavors. Taste #1 and smell #1 jelly beans should be
the same, taste #2 and smell #2 should be the same, and so on. Crush a few of the
"smell" jelly beans so the odor molecules can escape into the bag. Close the bags
by folding down the top.
<p>
<li> Before Testing: Choose three of your classmates as testers and give them each
a sheet of paper. Instruct them to draw a data table with three columns and three
rows. The columns should read: "smell only"; "taste only"; and "taste and smell."
The three rows should read: "flavor 1"; "flavor 2"; and "flavor 3."
<p>
<li> Taste Test: Instruct the testers to close their eyes and plug their noses.
Choose one of the taste bags and instruct each tester to chew on a sample from
this bag. In five seconds, ask them to record on their data table what flavor
they believe the sample to be. Repeat the procedure for the remaining taste bags.
A small sip of water between samples will help clear away the previous flavor and
provide a more accurate test. If they cannot tell the flavor, have them record
"unknown."
<p>
<li> Smell Test: Choose one of the "smell" sample bags. Have testers close their
eyes, open the bag, and inhale the aroma for 10 seconds. Remove the bag and close
the top tightly. Have your testers record the flavor of the sample on the data
table. Make sure each of them repeats this procedure for the other two samples.
<p>
<li> Smell and Taste Test: Use the "taste" bags again. Repeat the procedure as in
step # 4, "Taste Test," but do not have your testers hold their noses shut. Be
sure, however, that they have their eyes closed. Ask them to record their guesses
in the appropriate column on their data table.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><ol>
<li> Which sense, taste or smell, identified the correct flavor most
often? 
<li> How were the "taste" messages your brain received different from the
"smell" messages? 
<li> How do you think candy makers simulate fruit flavors? 
<li> Why do you taste more flavor when you chew a jelly bean than when you suck on it? 5.
If you took the Smell and Taste Test with your eyes open, do you think you could
recognize the flavor of a purple jelly bean that has an orange flavor? What data
from your tests support your conclusion?
</ol>

<hr><p>
<b><A NAME="TRY"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p></A></b> Recapture a "smell" memory. Put a number of different, fragrant items
in separate paper bags--a pine bough, broken cinnamon sticks, mothballs, a cloth
sprinkled with baby powder, lemons. Sniff each bag until one brings a strong
memory to mind. Write about this memory.
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>Create a survey to identify the favorite smells and tastes of your
friends. Conduct your survey and display the results on a graph. Which smells and
tastes were most popular?  Now place your results in a Venn diagram. Do you see
any overlap between favorite smells and favorite tastes?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p> Can you tell the difference between an apple and a potato by using
only the sense of taste? Cut an apple and a potato into the same size pieces.
Close your eyes, plug your nose, and lick one of the pieces. Can you tell what it
is? Next, unplug your nose and eat the piece. Can you identify it now?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>Animals and insects use smells to send messages. Cats and dogs, for
example, put their own personal smell stamp on objects to communicate the message
"no trespassing." Ants lay down odor trails to mark the pathway to food. The
monarch butterfly and ladybug produce odors that say, "I don't taste as good as I
look." Research an animal by reading and thinking about how it uses smell to
communicate.

<center><h1>TEARS</h1>
<i>Why Do We Cry?</i></center><p><hr>

     <p>
<ul>
<li>What does it feel like after you've been crying?  
<li>Are the tears we cry when chopping onions different from the tears we shed
while watching a sad movie?  
<li>Do we produce tears when we're asleep?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Tears flow from tear glands into your eyes through tiny tear ducts.  The tear
glands are located under your upper 
lids, and when stimulated, produce tears to form a thin film over your eyeballs. 
Every time you blink the film 
spreads over your eyes to keep them moist and free of dust and other irritants. 
Whether you are awake or asleep, 
happy or sad, this salty fluid is always flowing from the tear glands.<p>

Besides protecting your eyes, the tear glands produce more fluid when your eyes
are irritated.  These extra tears 
are called <A href="#reflex">reflex</a> or irritant tears.  And, when something
makes you happy or sad, your tear glands will produce 
<A href="#emotio">emotional</a> tears.  Used tears then drain down into two tiny
openings on the brim of your upper and lower eyelids at 
the inner edge of your eyes, which lead to the nasolacrimal tear ducts next to
the bridge of your nose.  From there, 
they are channeled into your nasal cavity where they are swallowed or blown out
with other nasal fluids.  If there 
are too many tears, they will overflow your lower lid and run down your
cheeks.<p>

Some people have to help stimulate the production of natural tears.  This disease
is called Dry Eye Syndrome or 
<A href="#syndro">Sjogren's Syndrome</a>.  People who have diseases like
rheumatoid arthritis or lupus often have this condition.  They 
must use artificial tears up to every 10 to 15 minutes, and apply other
medications to their eyes before going to 
bed as part of the treatment to improve the condition of their eyes.<p>

<hr>
<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>In the "Newton's Apple" segment on tears, a woman talked about having Dry Eye
Syndrome.  During the daytime, she 
must put special eye drops (artificial tears) in her eyes about every hour. 
Think about the things you do and the 
places you go where your eyes need protection.  How would they change if you had
Dry Eye Syndrome and had to use eye 
drops that often?  What would it feel like to do something very often that other
people don't even have to think 
about?
<li>If Dry Eye Syndrome goes untreated it can cause blindness.  What other
seemingly insignificant things, such as not 
being able to cry, could result in such dramatic results?
<li>Humans are the only animals that cry emotional tears.  Do you think these
tears have any other biological purpose?  
What might this purpose be?
<li>What does someone who's been crying look like?</ol>

<h1><center><B>Activity Page</B></center></h1>

<B>Tears and Blinking</B><p>
Find out how much your eyes work in a minute of blinking!<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
In this activity, you will determine the average number of times humans blink in
one minute and the range of how the 
number of blinks per minute varies from one person to another.<p>
<img align=right src="Images/tears.gif" hspace=10>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Stopwatch or clock with a second hand
<li>Pencil/paper
<li>Chart for data collection</ul>
<p>
1.  Ask at least 10 people to help you gather information (data) on blinking. 
You will want to observe everyone under 
the same conditions.  This is called controlling the variables.  You should
control for time, temperature and location.<p>

2.  Count how many times each person blinks in a minute.  Enter your data in a
chart.<p>
3.  Add the number of blinks from all the people you observed.  Divide the sum by
the total number of people observed to
determine the average number of blinks.<p>  
4.  To find the range, look for the person with the lowest number of blinks and
the person with the most blinks per 
minute.  The difference between the fewest and the most is called the range.  For
example, if George had five blinks 
and Juanita had 13, than the range is from five to 13.<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  How does your data compare to other studies done by your class?<p>
2.  What might happen if people blink twice as much as the average?  If they
cant blink at all?<p>
3.  Why do you blink?  What might cause you to blink more often?  Are these the
same reasons your classmates or family 
have?  How are their reasons different?<p>

Should people try not to cry over onions?  When peeled or cut, onions release a
chemical that reacts with tears on the 
surface of your eyes.  The chemical reaction produces sulfuric acid which
irritates your eyes.  Interview friends, 
family and neighbors to see what methods they use to keep from crying.  Do they
cry or try not to cry when they peel or 
slice onions?   Experiment with other vegetables and fruits to determine if
peeling, slicing, or chopping any of them 
makes you cry.<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430

Most animals that live in air produce tears to keep their eyes moist.  Many have
eyelids and lashes that also help 
protect their eyes.  Read about different animals like turtles, owls and snakes
and find at least three that do not 
have eyelids.  How do they protect their eyes?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430

The act of shedding tears is referred to as "weeping" or "crying."
<ol>
<li>What do the following phrases or tears mean?  
   Weeping Willow?        Read it and Weep?
   A Weeping Wound?       Brought Tears to His/Her Eyes?
   The Weeping Wall?      Cry Baby?
   To Have a Good Cry?    Crying Your Heart Out?
   Crocodile Tears?
<li>Write a poem about, or draw a picture of, a weeping sky.</ol><p>

The salt in tears acts as an antiseptic and prevents eye infections.  Read the
labels on eye care products at home, the 
grocery story, or the drug store.  Do any of them contain salt solutions or list
saline or sodium chloride as an 
ingredient?  Find out what is in artificial tears, contact lens supplies, and eye
wash solutions.<p><p>

<h1>How TV Works</h1>
How does Newton's Apple get from the studio to my television?  How does my
television set receive sound and light energy?<p>
<hr>
</center>

David, Peggy, and Nancy conduct a "formal" investigation of how television
works.<br>
Segment length:  27:00<p>
<p>
<h4><img align=middle hspace=0 src=../stills/apples.gif width=30 height=37>
 Insights</a></h4>
<p>
Behind-the-scenes at Newton's Apple, a team of performers, producers,
directors, engineers, and editors work feverishly to produce a 30-minute,
award-winning program.  But how do the scenes that are shot in the studio and
on location get converted from live action to videotaped entertainment?  <p>
To understand how television works, you need to know about light, sound, and
<a href="#three">electromagnetic</a> waves.  Simply put, a television camera turns the light and
sound of live action into pulses of electricity that are transmitted from the
television station in waves, and are then received by your television.  Your TV
reverses the process by turning electromagnetic waves back into light and
sound, allowing you to see the images.<p>
Using Newton's Apple as an example of this process, light bounces off of David
and enters the television camera.  The camera changes the light into electronic
video signals.  Simultaneously, the microphone picks up the sound of David's
voice and changes it to electronic audio signals.  To produce the electronic
color signals, the camera separates David's image into the three primary colors
of light:  red, blue, and green.<p>
When the program is broadcast, the electronic signals are sent to the station's
<a href="#six">transmitter</a>.  Here, the signals are converted to electromagnetic waves.  This
transmitter first produces a powerful carrier wave onto which both the video
and audio signals are placed.  The carrier wave is at a specific <a href="#four">frequency</a>,
which you tune in on your TV dial.  These waves are emitted by the station's
<a href="#one">antenna</a> and are received by the antenna at your home.<p>
When you turn to your PBS <a href="#two">channel</a>, you select the frequency on which the
Newton's Apple transmitter is broadcasting.  The television receiver sorts out
that frequency from among the others, allowing only the signals specific to
that channel to come through.
The receiver also separates the audio from the video signal, sending the audio
to the speaker and the video to the picture tube.  The video signal is then
separated into signals for each primary color.  Each color signal has its own
electron gun that sweeps across the inside of the picture tube and excites the
more than 300,000 <a href="#five">phosphor</a> dots coated on the television tube.  The picture
emerges as the guns quickly scan the entire screen to create an image of David
in lifelike color.<p>

 Main Activity</h4></a>
<p>
<center>
<h1>Color My World</h1>
Discover how a television creates multi-colored images by using only three
primary colors.<br>
</center>
<p>

Turn on a color television set and the screen lights up with tiny red, blue,
and green dots.  Because the dots are close together and change quickly, our
brain mixes these colors together to produce an incredible assortment of
colors.  Mix colored lights together and see what happens.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><p>
<ul>
<li>red, blue, and green 100-watt floodlamp lightbulbs OR red, blue, and green 
cellophane gels (available at art supply stores) to place over
white or clear bulbs<p>
<li>3 clamp-on photo floodlamp or spotlight receptacles OR 3 standard flashlights<p>
<li>standard projection screen OR a large sheet of white paper or fabric
taped to a wall</ul>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the different-colored spotlights so that they are all aimed at a
central spot on your screen.  (Try clamping them on the backs of three chairs
or a table top, positioned about six feet back from the screen.)<p>
<li>Make the room as dark as possible and turn on the spotlights, adjusting
them so that the combination of their light produces a whitish color on the
screen.<p>
<li>Turn off the red spotlight.  What color is evident now?  Repeat by turning
off the blue and green spots while leaving the others on.  How many different
colors can you get from only three colored lights?<p>
<li>Stand about halfway between the screen and the spots and wave your hands
back and forth.  What happens to the colors on the screen?<p>
Note:  The same procedure can be done with students holding flashlights and
aiming the beams at a central point on the screen.  However, it may be harder
to create the colored shadows using this method.
</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><p>
1.  Why do the colors on the projection screen change when you move your body
in front of them?  How might this relate to electron guns in a television set
turning on and off?  <p>
2.  Television isn't the only medium that uses color-blending to create
full-color images.  How does this same principle relate to the printing of
color pictures in newspapers, or the processing of satellite images of the
earth?
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This">

<p>
Invite a television-repair person to visit your class and bring along a broken
television set.  Talk about and label the various parts of the television set
and learn more about how your own television works.
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This">
<br clear=left>
Television flashes a series of images so fast that your eye sees them as one
moving image.  Make a flickerbook to help understand this idea.  Take a small
pad of paper stapled together at one end.  Draw a series of simple images, such
as a seed growing.  Working from the last page to the first, draw the images
with incremental differences. When done, flip through your book from the last
page to the first.
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This">
<br clear=left>
Videotape your own version of Newton's Apple.  Divide the class into
"production teams" and have each team select a science question to explore.
Individuals can be assigned the specific responsibilities that go into making a
television show:  researcher, producer, director, performer, and videotape
technician.  Combine all the segments into one program and invite another class
in for the official viewing.
<p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=../stills/trythis.gif width=143 height=30 alt="Try This">
<br clear=left>
Take a magnifying glass and look closely at a show playing on your television
set.  Do you see the phosphor dots?  Where else might you find the concept of
tiny dots forming images?  Which of your examples uses the colors of light and
which uses the colors of pigment?

<center><h1>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</h1>
<i>New Frontiers in Electronic Communications</i></center><p><hr>

    <p>
<ul>
<li>How does a telephone work?  
<li>How fast do sound and light travel?  
<li>How could fiber optics improve our telecommunications?  
<li>Are any fiber optics in use today?</ul>

<hr><CENTER><B>DISCUSSION</B></CENTER><p>
Alexander Graham Bell invented a talking machine that used pulses of electricity
to carry sound through copper wires 
and called it the telephone.  Soon after, he tested the photophone, another
talking machine that used a beam of sunlight
to carry voices from one place to another.  Although he had high hopes for the
future of his photophone, it depended on 
a constant source of sunlight and proved to be impractical.<p>

Not until the invention of <A href="#laser">lasers</A> and <A
href="#optfib">optical fibers</A> did Bell's dream come true.  In the mid-1970s,
researchers began 
pumping pulses of laser light through thin glass fibers to move information. 
Light is actually a sequence of vibrations.
Scientists discovered how to vary these patterns of vibrations and convey
information.  When a conversation occurs over 
a telephone system that uses optical fibers, the vibrations of your voice are
converted to the pattern of the laser.  
At the other end, these variations are turned back into sound.<p>

Because lasers can be <A href="#modul">modulated</a> with highly complex patterns
much greater quantities of information can be transmitted.
Stringing electrical cables or optical fiber cables from place to place is very
expensive.  Because the new optical 
fibers can handle so much more information than traditional telephone wires, it
has become more economical to replace 
conventional wires with the new technology.<p>

And, <A href="#fibopt">fiber-optic</a> communications are not limited to
telephone conversations.  They can even be used to transmit complex 
information, like television or data between computers.  As fiber-optic cables
interconnect our area, it will be 
possible to see and purchase items from distant stores, participate in classes or
meetings happening across the world, 
see people you're talking to on the telephone and have instant access to the
latest information stored in libraries, 
all without leaving your home!<p>

Other industries benefit from fiber optics.  Physicians use them to examine areas
of the body instead of performing 
surgery.  In industry, fiber optics aid workers in repairing jet engines, nuclear
reactors and other complicated 
machinery.  In the future, fiber optics will be used to control lighting,
heating, air conditioning, security systems 
and other types of machinery.  The most interesting uses of fiber optics are yet
dreamed about!<p>

<h3><center><b>Things to Talk About</h3></center></b><P><ol>
<li>What are the differences between sunlight and laser light?  
<li>Would you want a "videophone"?  
<li>What would Bell think about fiber optics?  What new uses for fiber optic
technology can you think of?</ol>

<h1><center><B>Activity Page</B></center></h1>

<B>Amazing Liquid Light</B><p>
Light always travels in a straight line, doesnt it?<p>

<B>Main Activity</B><p>
Light does travel in a straight line but there are times when it doesn't.  Light
can be inside a curving stream of 
water because the path of the light changes direction as it is reflected
internally by the water.  Discover how fiber 
optics use this principle.<p>

Materials:<ul>
<li>Tall, clear and slim jar with a lid
<li>Newspaper
<li>Flashlight
<li>Hammer
<li>Large nail
<li>Large container</ul>
<p>

1.  Make two holes in the jar lid with the hammer and the nail.  Make a large
hole near one edge and a smaller hole near
the opposite edge.<p>
2.  Fill the jar three quarters full with water.<p>
3.  Turn on the flashlight and hold it to the bottom of the jar so the light
shines into the jar.<p>
4.  Wrap the jar and the flashlight together in the newspaper.  Leave the lid of
the jar uncovered.  Be careful not to 
spill the water.  If needed, place tape over the holes until the pieces are
wrapped together.<p>
5.  Now get ready to "pour" light.  Turn the lights off and tilt the jar so the
water flows out the largest hole into a 
large container.<p>

<B>Questions</B><p>
1.  What happens if you stick your finger in the water stream near the jar?  Down
further on the stream?<p>
2.  Was the light contained in the stream or did it shine out like a lamp?<p> 
3.  What would the light look like if you used colored water?<p>
4.  How is the curved flow of the water similar to light pulses in fiber optics? 
What are the differences?<p>
5.  What does total internal reflection mean?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Lasers are used all around us.  Find as many of their uses as you can.  Where are
lasers used in the supermarket?  
Ask your doctor about laser surgery.  How is it different than standard surgery? 
Try to attend a laser light show to 
see energy waves become art.<p> 

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Laser light is contained in an optical fiber because of internal reflection.  A
periscope uses the same principle but 
with mirrors instead of optic fibers.  How could you use two mirrors to look
around a corner?<p>  

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Investigate ways light is used in communication.  Learn more about Morse code and
see if you and your friends can send 
messages to each other in the dark with a flashlight.  How are holograms
created?<p>

<img src="Images/trythip.gif">  <img src="Images/trythis.gif" width=430
height=15><br>

Energy moves from one place to another in waves.  Tie a long piece of rope to a
tree or a pole.  Make your own waves by 
shaking the rope up and down.  What energy moves when you shake the rope?  What
other materials could you use to make 
waves?  (See the Newton's Apple "Slinky  Physics" for extra hints!)  Light waves
are the fastest waves we know about.  
How fast do light waves from the Sun travel to the Earth?<p><p>

<p>
Virtual <i><A HREF="#reality">reality</i></a> can transport you into a world of computer-generated sights, sounds, and tactile (touch) sensations. The more your senses are fooled, the more you believe the experience is <A HREF="#real">real</i></a>.
<p>
If you want to enter a virtual reality world, you can choose a couple different approaches. In one, you would go into a booth containing a computer monitor. The booth might represent a cockpit and the monitor a windshield. With the keyboard or joystick, you change the three-dimensional perspective of what you see on the screen-and take the airplane you're piloting into a rapid nosedive or a steep climb. 
<p>
Another, more expensive approach to virtual reality involves "the helmet and gloves." When you place one of these helmets on your head, your head movements allow you to see and hear the <A HREF="#virtual">virtual</i></a> world. The gloves can replace real touch with virtual touch. 
<p>
In this approach, two televisions cameras (or computer-graphic images) generate the virtual world. One camera or image is placed in front of each of your eyes, slightly offset in <A HREF="#perspective">perspective</i></a>. This creates the <A HREF="#illusion">illusion</i></a> of depth of view, or "stereoscopic vision." As your head turns to view different objects, a computer adjusts both the scene's perspective and associated sounds (coming through the headphones) to convince you that you are moving through the environment.
<p>
As your gloved hand touches a surface in the virtual world, <A HREF="#sensors">sensors</i></a> in the glove tell the computer where the hand is in space. With some gloves, the computer can send signals back to you through pressure vibrations to indicate when you've touched an object in the virtual world.
<p>
Virtual reality is more than just entertainment. For people with disabilities, it offers a way to interact with other people and to enter an artificial universe created by computer imaging, bypassing any physical limitations they may have. In industry, workers can draw upon this technology to design parts without expensive physical <A HREF="#mock-ups">mock-ups</i></a>, conduct chemistry experiments without risk, and learn how to operate new equipment with little loss in productivity. 
<p>

<b><h1>DROWNING A CANDLE FLAME</h1></b>
<b>Fool your friends into believing that water will not put out a candle flame.</b><pre>
</pre>
<b><h2><A NAME="MAIN">Main Activity</a></h2></b>
<p>

You will create a virtual reality with simple household materials and show your audience the amazing image of a candle burning underwater.
<p>
<b>Materials</b><ul> 
<li>two identical birthday candles
<li>one piece of window glass, any size larger than the candles. Tape around the sides with masking tape.
<li>supports (such as books) that will firmly hold the glass upright
<li>modeling clay to hold the candles upright
<li>matches
<li>clear water glass taller than the candles</ul>
<ol>
<li>Use a couple of books to support the glass upright. (Always use care when handling glass!)

<li>Place the candles in modeling clay equal distances from the glass, one in the front and one behind the glass. You can use the reflection of the front candle to position the back candle.

<li>Light the front candle. When you look through the glass, the back candle looks at though it is lit. Part of the light from the flame on the front candle is reflected off the glass back to your eye.

<li>Now place the back candle in the water glass. Again, adjust the equipment so that the candle flame appears to be in the glass when viewed from the front.

<li>Invite a friend to view from the front as you fill the water glass to a level above the candle flame.</ol>
<p>
<b>Questions</b><ol> 
<li>What was your reaction the first time you saw this effect?
<li>Look into a flat mirror, such as one in a bathroom. Where do you appear to be? Move toward the mirror, then back from it. How does the distance between you and the mirror compare with the distance your image is behind the mirror?
<li>Look out a window. Does window glass seem to reflect some light? Have you ever seen yourself in the window at night?
</ol>
<hr>
<b><A NAME="TRY"><img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"></a></b><p>
Visit a video arcade. How does the equipment employ virtual reality to get you involved in the game? Did you ever wonder whether it was the real world or a virtual reality world?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
Name some movies that have made you feel like you were actually in the scene. Watching a movie, have you every felt like you were riding on a roller coaster or flying low over a landscape in an airplane? Suggest ways that movie makers achieve this feeling of virtual reality through special effects, camera angles, and other strategies. Have you ever been to an Omnimax or Imax theater? How do you think they produce such realistic effects?
<p>
<img src="Images/artrythis.gif"><img src="Images/trythis.gif"><p>
With masking tape, make a straight line that's 1 meter (3.3') away from and parallel to a wall. Mark a point in the center of this line. Stand on the point, facing the wall, and have a friend walk up from behind to your immediate left. Without moving your head, announce when you can see your friend and have that person mark that point on the floor. Now try it on your right.  Connect the point you are standing on to the points on your left and right. Given that there are 360 degrees in a circle, what is the measure of your field of vision?

<p>
Who says you have to be in the sky to fly? Your feet may never leave the ground
(well, the water), but the amazing sensation of waterskiing definitely compares
to soaring through the air.<P>
The first person to master this sport was an 18-year-old named Ralph Samuelson.
In 1922, Samuelson tried skiing over water first on barrel staves and then on
snow skis. He finally found success on pine boards 2.5 meters (8 feet) long and
23 centimeters (9 inches) wide. Water-skiing really picked up speed after World
War II, when affordable, high-horsepower outboard motors meant more people could
own the fast boats needed to tow water-skiers. <P>
But how do you stand on water? The pressure on top of the water skis (including
the weight of the ski, the person, and the air above both) remains constant,
whether the skier is at rest or moving. However, as the skier picks up speed, the
water pushes against the bottom of the skis. The wider or longer the ski, or the
faster a boat is traveling, the easier it is for a skier to stay up on the water.
The average speed to keep a 68-kilogram (150-pound) adult afloat on water skis
would be 32-40 kilometers per hour (20-25 miles per hour). But for <A Href="#one">barefooting</A>,
where all 68 kilograms of weight are concen-trated on the soles of two feet, a
speed of 56 kilometers per hour (35 miles per hour) is necessary.<p>
Different lengths and <A Href="#four">edges</A> of water skis offer different combinations of speed
and control. For instance, a beginning skier would want two longer skis for
stability, with flat bottoms for riding high and fast on the <A Href="#seven">wake</A>. A more
advanced skier could switch to just one ski, called <A Href="#six">slaloming</A>, and use a <A Href="#two">beveled</A>
bottom for more controlled turns. And highly experienced skiers may choose a ski
with a <A Href="#three">concave</A> bottom, which holds turns by cupping water underneath. <P>
Some expert skiers even add an underwater <A Href="#five">rudder</A> with wings set at a particular
angle to aid turning. These wings create drag and slow down the ski like a brake,
making it easier to turn. Then, when the skier leans back to come out of a turn,
the wings become parallel to the flow of water and offer minimal resistance.<P>

<font size=+2>Connections</font><p>

1.  Why did Ralph Samuelson's first attempts on barrel staves and snow skis fail?
What technological advances allow skiers to go completely barefoot or to build
pyramids of people on water skis?<BR>
2.  Trick skis are short and stubby and have beveled edges both on the bottom and
top. How would this shape help a skier do side-slides, somersaults, and
180-degree turns?<P>

<center>
<font size=+5>Skimming the Surface</font>
<br>
Mold an aerodynamic water ski from clay and see if it stays afloat.<br>
</center>
<BR>
<P>
Every time water-skiers cut into a curve, fluid dynamics are at work to keep them
upright. In this activity, you'll work with-and against-fluid dynamics to learn
how water skis are designed for different purposes.<P>
Materials
<ul>
<li>modeling clay<BR>
<li>thread<BR>
<li>button<BR>
<li>tub filled with water<P>
</ul>
1.   First, experiment with the buoyancy of your clay. Mold different amounts of
clay into aerodynamic and nonaerodynamic shapes. Drop them into the water from 30
cm (1') above the surface. Do some shapes sink faster than others? Does a higher
or lower dropping distance affect how quickly they sink?<p>
2.   Tie the button onto the end of the thread.  Shape the clay around the button
into your most aerodynamic shape from step 1.  Using constant speed, pull the clay
along the surface of the water.  Does it spin or travel straight? Now try your
most nonaerodynamic shape, using the same amount of clay, and pulling it along at
the same speed as before.  Is it more difficult to keep the speed constant? Which
of the two sinks faster when you stop pulling?<p>
3.   Start thinking like a water ski designer.  First, experiment with different
bottom shapes-square, beveled, and concave.  What happens when you alter the
bottom of one side of your clay &quot;ski&quot; but not the other? Can you create
a ski that turns right while your &quot;towrope&quot; travels straight? One that
dives underwater? <p>
4.   Try changing the point where your thread exits the clay.  Move it up and down
in front, as well as back and forth in the body.  What changes? Add weight with
pennies at different places on the clay.  Can you build a &quot;ski&quot; that
still moves straight and stays afloat with five pennies at the tip? How does your
design change when you move the pennies to the back? <P>

Dig through some old clothes and select about five of different fabrics, choosing
pieces large enough for you to sit on.  Take them to a park that has a large
slide.  Experiment with the friction level for each fabric by sitting on it as you
slide.  Does the friction level change if you switch to squatting rather than
sitting? What happens when you only half-sit on a slippery fabric?<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
Water-skiers hold onto the towrope using an opposed grip, rather than an
overhand.  This increases power and makes it easier to pull your arms close to
your body and control speed and balance.  Make a tug-of-war towrope using 30-cm
(1') lengths of plastic pipe as handles on each end.  Try pulling against a
friend, once with your hands gripping with all your fingers the same way, and
once with the opposed &quot;baseball bat&quot; grip.  Do you notice a difference
in your pulling power? <P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../stills/trythis.gif">
<br clear=left>
Water-skiers always wear a personal flotation device made of closed-cell foam
covered with vinyl or nylon fabric.  Using a blunt table knife, carve different
shapes out of Styrofoam&reg;.  Fill a sink with water and experiment with the
different sizes and shapes.  Do different shapes seem to offer more resistance to
sinking when you weigh the pieces down with coins? Can you create a shape that
sinks?<P>

Powerboat engines are measured according to their horsepower, with one horsepower
being able to 550 pounds one foot per second.  You can measure your own horsepower
and compare it to a boat engine.  First measure the vertical height of a flight of
stairs.  Have a friend time how quickly you can run up the stairs.  Your horsepower
equals:<P>
 your weight in pounds x stairway height in feet<BR>
 - divided - by -<br>
 number of seconds it took you to run up the stairs<P>

<h2><B><A NAME="INSIGHT">INSIGHTS</A></B></h2>
<p>
You skim across the surface of the water at incredible speeds, drive towards a
whitecapped wave, and then take flight like a skateboarder in a half-pipe, each
muscle straining against the force of the wind. Then you smash into the trough of
the wave, spring up from near disaster, and look quickly for the next wave so you
can do it all over again. This is the exciting sport of windsurfing.
<p>
Windsurfing has its roots in the '60s when it began to take shape from
conversations between an aeronautical engineer and a scientist. In 1969, the
engineer presented a symposium paper entitled "Wind Surfing: A New Concept in
Sailing." This new concept entailed releasing the mast from its traditional fixed
vertical position and allowing it to pivot around its base. The sailor then can
both steer and balance the board through appropriate movements of the mast and
sail. From these beginnings, windsurfing has grown to become a popular sport
attracting 100,000 newcomers a year.
<p>
How does a windsurfer manage to move the sailboard across the water? The force
that moves a sailboard (or any sailboat) is not produced simply by the wind
pushing on the sail. The process is closely related to the <A HREF="#lift"><i>lift</i></A> on an airplane
caused by the air moving over a specially-shaped wing. Bernoulli's principle
tells us that in a fluid (such as air), regions of higher velocity have lower
<A HREF="#pressure"><i>pressure</i></A> than surrounding regions.
<p>
A sail may be thought of as a vertical wing. The wind moves faster (in order to
travel the greater distance) over the <A HREF="#convex"><i>convex</i></A> curve of the forward part of the
sail than it does when it goes straight over the back part of the sail.
<p>
According to Bernoulli's principle, there is lower pressure on the forward part
of the sail (shaded region in the figure at right) and thus a net force
perpendicular to the sail. This is the force that propels the windsurfer, but you
may have noticed that part of this force is to the side of the sailboard. What
keeps the board from moving sideways? The answer is the "daggerboard" which
extends from the sailboard down into the water.
<p>
This daggerboard not only keeps the board from drifting sideways, but it also
acts as a <A HREF="#fulcrum"><i>fulcrum</i></A> about which the sailor pivots the board for steering.

<h1><b>WHAT IS LIFT?</h1></b> 
<b>Build a model wing and find out what happens when you move it
through the air.</b>
<p>
<h2><b><A NAME="main">MAIN ACTIVITY</A></h2></b>
<p>
The lift on the sail of a sailboard is similar to that on a wing of an airplane.
What forces and pressures generate lift? Construct a model to demonstrate the
force of lift.
<p>
<b>Materials</b> 
<ul>
<li> two 8 1/2" x 11" sheets of paper 
<li> ruler 
<li> transparent tape 
<li> sharpened pencil 
<li> 60-cm (24") piece of monofilament fishing line 
<li> one 15-cm (6") straw 
<li> two 7.5-cm (3") straws
</ul>
<ol>
<li> Fold one sheet of paper in half, but do not crease the fold.
<p>
<li> Tape the long opened edge of paper with three small pieces of tape to keep it
closed. This taped side will be known as your "trailing edge," while the folded
side will be known as the "leading edge."
<p>
<li> With the pencil, mark an "X" on the center line of the paper about one inch
from the leading edge.
<p>
<li> Punch a hole through both the top and bottom of the paper at the "X." (Be
careful not to crease the paper at the fold.)
<p>
<li> Place the 15-cm straw through the hole you just punched. Use tape, if
necessary, to hold the straw in place.
<p>
<li> Tie one end of the fishing line to the middle of a 7.5-cm straw.
<p>
<li> Pass the other end of the fishing line through the 15-cm straw which is
attached to the paper.
<p>
<li> Pull the fishing line through and tie this end to the other 7.5-cm straw. The
7.5-cm straws will be your handles.
<p>
<li> On the other piece of paper, trace two copies of the airfoil shape below and
cut out the shapes. Tape the shapes to the open ends of the "wing." The flat edge
of the shapes should be on the bottom of the wing (see illustration).
<p>
<li> Taking the 7.5-cm straw handles, one in each hand, draw the fishing line
tight and position it so the line is perpendicular to the floor. Make sure the
flatter surface of the wing faces down.
<p>
<li> With your arms out in front of you, make a quick sweeping motion through the
air. Be certain that the leading edge of the wing is in front.
</ol>
<p>

<b>Questions</b> 
<ol>
<li> What did your piece of paper do? 
<li> What caused the wing to move upward? 
<li> Explain how this demonstration relates to a sail. 
<li> Explain the forces that move the paper upward.

<H1>Problems Affecting Rural CH 2 Viewers</H1>

Signal level changes occur daily to almost all rural Ch 2 
viewers.  Sometimes these changes become so dramatic as to cause interruptions in the picture and sound, lasting from a few minutes to several hours.  Below are explanations of two of the major causes of reception problems in outlying areas.<p>

<DL>
<DT><FONT SIZE="+2"><big>Tropospheric</big></FONT><DD>
On calm sunny days a layer of warm air can become trapped beneath a cooler layer of air.  This condition is known as "temperature inversion".  The effect that it causes allows the Ch 2 signal to find a slightly longer path to the viewers set, as it bends back towards earth, returning from 4 to 7 miles above ground level.  This causes interference to the primary signal from our transmitter.  The picture begins to "pulsate" and shortly lines appear, if the refracted signal is strong, the picture may be completely disrupted.<p>

This effect clears up once the wind blows and begins to mix the different air masses.<p>

<DT><FONT SIZE="+2"><big>Ionospheric</big></FONT><DD>
Radiation from the sun allows the area from 30 to 300 miles above the earth to bend back radio signals.  TV Ch 2 is effected from the lower ionized layer 30 to 50 miles above the earth, know as the "E layer".  During the summer months and periods of high solar activity, signals from as far away as the coasts, may cause viewing interference.  The severity of this mixing of different signals can range from mild (a few lines running through the picture) to complete elimination of KTCA's signal and other stations signals being received.<p>

This effect generally starts around (local) noon, and can last into the evening hours.  Frequently, "northern lights" are visible during days with high levels of solar activity.<p></DL>


Although there is no "cure" for the reception problems above, a well installed antenna system may help eliminate effects from minor disturbances.<p>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><big>Guidelines:</big></FONT>  (Recommendations for improving reception)
<ol>
<LI>An antenna designed for the distance of reception, or greater.<p>
<LI>Antenna must be mounted above surrounding obstacles.<p>
<LI>High quality lead in wire from antenna, i.e., coax.<p>
<LI>Antenna mounted pre-amp to overcome losses in lengthy lead in installations.<p>
<LI>For safety always include a lightening arrestor in your installation.  It might not improve your reception, but it can protect your television, your dwelling, and your life.
</OL>

<H1>RE:	Improving Ch. 17 Reception - External Antenna</H1>


Recently we have all begun tuning in UHF stations, those TV channels that used to be vacant.  The change in viewing habits has brought many of us to the back of our sets, wondering what to do next.<p>

A brief description of what is generally involved in obtaining quality UHF reception follows.  Whether you attempt to install a system, or elect to have it professionally done, knowing what it takes to make it work will be an advantage to you.<p>

UHF TV covers channels 14-69.  The frequency is much higher than VHF.  This higher frequency means two important things, first, the antennas will be physically smaller and second, the wire we use to bring the signal from the antenna to the set can reduce the signal level very quickly when using long runs to your set.<p>

Let's look at the cable first.  The best choice you can make is to buy a premium quality, 100% foil shielded, coaxial cable.  The old "twin lead" won't do.  The connectors for this cable are called "F" type, proper installation requires a "crimping tool" to insure good mechanical contact.<p>

Transformers.  Connections on your TV and antenna are standardized and either end maybe different.  The two types are:  75 ohm, which accepts the "F" type connector directly from coaxial cable.  The second type is 300 ohm, which has 2 screw heads spread about one inch apart.  In order to maximize signal transfer from your antenna/cable/set the transition from an "f" fitting to the screw terminals (or old flat lead hook up) requires a "300:75 ohm balun transformer."  These transformers will work in either direction, the antenna or set, it makes no difference.  When purchasing these be sure they are rated for VHF/UHF use.<p>

Antennas used for television reception are generally rated by a mileage factor.  Depending on your distance from the transmission point (in our case 694 & Victoria, north of downtown St. Paul) you should select one appropriately rated.  I recommend that the selection should error on the high side, a little larger antenna is better.  If your plans are to add a second television set, or if the coax length is excessive (over 75' or so) again, purchase the next larger antenna size.<p>

The guidelines here are vague because each area within our viewing range could require a different size antenna.  If you are going to install your own system, I recommend you purchase the equipment from a knowledgeable local vendor.  The cost of the antenna may be more than what a "discount" store would sell them for, but, the correct selection will save you money and increase your viewing pleasure.<p>

Your new antenna will require mounting.  Putting antennas in the attic (with rare exception) generally results in poor performance.  Unless you must try an inside mounting scheme, I recommend you stay away from it.<p>

Antennas placed on chimneys are going to corrode and fail at a much faster rate due to the flue gasses (this is another mounting scheme to avoid).<p>

Outside rooftop antennas need to be mounted away from surrounding objects.  The antenna height is a lot less critical than what most believe.  A minimum height of the length of the longest antenna element is a good guideline.  Installing the antenna high in the air is only required to overcome nearby obstacles.  Once you are above nearby obstacles, there is seldom any advantage to going higher.<p>

Lightning protection should be included in your installation.  Drilling a hole in the roof and snaking the coax between the walls may be a neat visual installation, however, I've seen many walls and ceilings removed by the fire department to put out flames from a lightning strike.  The safest path to your TV is to run the coax down the roof to a ground rod/lightning arrestor and then into your house at near grade level.  Your local antenna dealer should be able to guide you with building codes and required equipment.<p>

<A HREF="FTP:./stills/antenna.gif">Pointing your antenna</A>.  A professional installer will use a special meter to read signal levels while turning your antenna towards our transmitter site.  The same results can be obtained by using a map and compass.  If your installation is done properly, i.e.., good antenna, good coax, no surrounding objects, pointing the antenna to the 694/Victoria location is all that's left to do.<p>

There is now a thick "putty like" tape that is on the market for weather proofing connectors.  It works real well.<p>

Installing your own antenna system can be fun and rewarding.  There are a multitude of combinations to choose from when hooking up TV's, VCR's, games, switch boxes, etc.  Your local library or book store should have books that go into greater detail about these special installations.<p>

Obtaining the best possible reception of your supported Public Television stations is important to us both.  Please don't hesitate to contact us if we may be of further assistance.<p>

Ask Jack Willis, the president and chief executive officer of Twin Cities Public Television, what makes him good at his job and he'll admit only to being optimistic, lucky, driven, and frank. It would be safe to add "self-effacing," because when you put the same question to Willis's colleagues they talk about his courage and passion, his generosity and fairness, his sense of purpose, and his brains. 
<p>
Those who know Willis only through his Pledge Week fund-raising pitches, meanwhile, might well come up with another word entirely to describe him, something like "besieged." 
<p>
This is a man, after all, who's running a public broadcasting station in a middling market at a time of rising production costs and shrinking resources, of Gingrichian tightfistedness and the specter of a 500-channel television environment. Surely there are dicier jobs on the planet today, but it's difficult to think of one that doesn't involve biohazards or gunfire. 
<p>
"Let's just say I'm a man who's challenged," Willis suggests. 
<p>
Jack Willis is sixty-one. Though born in Milwaukee and raised in Los Angeles, he's spent the lion's share of his career in New York, and it shows. Willis is a tough, competitive guy in a tough, competitive industry. He's a battler who seems to relish challenge and welcome risk, who in his eventful career has faced adversaries more daunting than a mob of hatchet-wielding congressional Republicans, and whose few professed regrets include not giving pro baseball a shot when he had the opportunity.
<p>
He wears his social conscience on his sleeve. He pulls for the underdog, the disenfranchised, those members of the community who have come to be known during his tenure at KTCA/KTCI as the "unheard voices, unserved audience." When he was a kid back in working-class L.A., he watched his father toss a man out of their house after the man brandished a petition to keep a Mexican family from moving into the neighborhood. As a tyro journalist, he made documentary films about the civil-rights struggle in the deep South and poverty in Appalachia. Such experiences, he will tell you, had a profound and permanent effect.
<p>
Over the course of a thirty-five-year career, Willis has worked with David Susskind, Eric Sevareid, Charles Collingwood, and other television luminaries. As a young idealist in New York, he knew Pete Seeger and Malcolm X, read Marcus Garvey on race and Michael Harrington on the poor. His television productions have garnered seven Emmy Awards, his friendships and associations a wealth of experience and convictions. 
<p>
Since 1990 Willis has been in charge at Twin Cities Public Television - better known to viewers of NewsNight Minnesota, Sesame Street, Fawlty Towers, and so on, as Channels 2 and 17 - and he has committed the station to an unusual mission among public broadcasting facilities. It's his intention, he says, not only to keep KTCA robust during these trying times but to develop the local programming and services to help his adopted community through the changes it is facing.
<p>
"There are real opportunities with everything that's going on," he says. "That's why I'm not feeling embattled or besieged - but why I'm feeling challenged."
<p>
<hr align=center width=10%>
<p>

Willis is sitting in his office at KTCA-TV headquarters in Downtown St. Paul one autumn afternoon.
<p>
He is razor thin, stylishly attired, and unexpectedly boyish, with a full head of silver hair, a sudden smile, and a rapid delivery whose pace rather than accent might remind you of New York. He has to shift in his chair frequently; constant stiffness and pain in his back and legs are the lasting effects of a crippling accident twenty-five years ago.
<p>
Willis says the financial pressures KTCA faced were apparent to him almost from the beginning. Four or five months after he arrived here, he remembers, the station's chief financial officer handed him a sheet of paper. "I said, 'What's this?' He said, 'These are our three major sources of revenue, and they're all going to level off over the next four years.' I thought, Well, shit, why didn't someone tell me this before I signed up?" 
<p>
Sure enough, four years later those three major sources - membership, corporate underwriting, and foundation operating grants - had flattened out. What's more, conservative Republicans had stormed Congress and were threatening to strangle Big Bird. The congressional zealots have since backed off from their intention to zero out the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but the financial pressures remain.
<p>
"Our answer to those projections five years ago was a long-range plan, where we talked about really having an impact on the community, with outreach initiatives, local news programming, and arts and culture that intersect with the community," Willis says. "And that, today, is pretty much what we're doing." 
<p>
KTCA has long been a leader among the nation's 350 public television stations in the development of its own programming. Under Willis's predecessors, Bill Kobin and Dick Moore, such homegrown productions as Newton's Apple and Almanac were recognized as jewels in public television's crown. Since Willis took over, the local focus has markedly intensified. There is, according to Twin Cities TV people, almost a religious dedication to the cause.
<p>
Willis explains that the local emphasis is both morally correct and financially imperative, despite the fact that it costs more to produce your own program than to buy one prepackaged from someone else. His reasoning goes like this:
<p>
Eighty cents out of every dollar raised by public TV comes from the community. True, much of that money has been raised in response to such popular PBS programs as Nature, The American Experience, and Masterpiece Theatre. But with the rise of cable TV and videocassettes, high-quality arts, entertainment, and science programming is increasingly available from other sources. Meanwhile, commercial stations are cutting their local programming to the quick, opting for ever-larger slabs of network fare. Thus it is both the opportunity and responsibility of public stations to provide meaningful local programming and services. And the mission is not only to inform and entertain, Willis says. The mission is to improve the quality of life in the community.
<p>
As examples of the kind of local productions inspired by the station's mission, Willis points to such shows as Lost Twin Cities, a popular historical review; Almanac, now in its twelfth year of weekly public-affairs coverage and commentary; Kev Koom Siab, a weekly program in the Hmong language for the Hmong community; Don't Believe the Hype, produced by and for inner-city kids; and the occasional People's Summit, "where we ask people from the community into the studio, then get out of the way and let them talk about issues that concern them." He mentions outreach efforts that are unusual, if not unique, among public television stations: such innovative services as Mathline, an interactive teacher-training course piloted for PBS, and the training of local day-care providers on the use of PBS's Mister Rogers' Neighborhood to teach kids "basic values." All of this and more, he says, is intended to help "close the gap between the information haves and have-nots."
<p>
Willis's most daring step in his drive for local programming was the creation, in the spring of 1994, of NewsNight Minnesota, a Monday-through-Thursday evening newscast unlike any other show produced by a public station anywhere. Explaining the need he perceived for the show, he said: "Never has access to timely, thoughtful information and analysis been so important. Never has it been so lacking on local television news. To fill this gap, we have created NewsNight Minnesota, whose mission is to increase the understanding of the complex issues facing us. Its goal is to create citizens, not consumers."
<p>
He gives NewsNight, after its first year and a half on the air, a mixed review. "I think it's been a terrific success in some ways. Our goal has been to help people understand difficult issues, to present the news in depth and give it context, and to cover communities of color, greater Minnesota, and other communities that aren't normally covered in depth. And I think we're succeeding. The ratings, for a public-affairs program on public television, are excellent. We regularly double or even triple The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer's numbers, which is the show we follow. On the other hand, I think we have a way to go. Our problem is inconsistency and not having enough people to do long-form investigative reports while staying on top of the daily news. We haven't quite figured that out yet.
<p>
"We've also got to find ways to have our people spend more time on the streets and get closer to the community. I'm hoping that with time we can get deeper into the neighborhoods, educate ourselves on their issues, and make reliable contacts among the people who live there." For Willis, that indeed is what will ultimately set NewsNight apart from commercial newscasts: strong neighborhood connections, a grassroots community context, and a sensibility that acknowledges that history did not begin today and that - rich and poor; rural, suburban, and inner-city - everybody's in this together.
<p>
Willis and his cohorts, including news and public - affairs chief Bill Hanley and former WCCO-TV manager Ron Handberg, who helped launch NewsNight Minnesota, say they believe Minnesotans are receptive to issue-focused shows. "This is a news-oriented, public-affairs community," Willis says. "People here are interested in politics. They still vote. They haven't become too cynical." Time will tell whether NewsNight has the lasting power of Almanac. The show is funded, with the help of several local foundation grants, through 1997.
<p>
<hr align=center width=10%>
<p>

Jack Willis's interest in local public-affairs productions dates back to the early 1970s, when he was vice president for programming at WNET, the New York public television station. There he created and produced a show called The 51st State, a brash, controversial, Emmy-winning nightly news magazine that, he says, was "committed to doing news from the ground up - community news, how policies affect people, taking it from their point of view." The show, he says, was hugely effective. "It showed me what impact a local station could have on the community if it took the community approach, if it said what we're about is community building and being inclusive, which means including people not ordinarily seen or heard on the screen."
<p>
Willis had arrived at that point via a circuitous route that nonetheless bore hints of what was to come. 
<p>
His father was in the shoe business in Los Angeles. Jack attended UCLA, started law school, then dropped out and joined the Army. A standout shortstop both in college and the service, he was courted by the Boston and Chicago White Sox organizations. "But I was pretty tired of ball by that time, so I turned them down," he says. "Looking back, that might have been a mistake. I don't think I was good enough to make it to the big leagues, but it would have been fun to say I played a summer in the minors." Instead, following his discharge from the Army, he returned to UCLA and earned a law degree.
<p>
Willis never practiced law. Deciding he wanted to teach overseas, he headed for New York with plans to go on to Africa or the Mideast. But while awaiting travel arrangements, he took a job as a researcher at CBS News and was quickly hooked on TV. He worked for the next couple of years as an associate producer for David Susskind's Open End interview show, got to know some of the emerging leaders of the civil-rights movement, and began thinking about producing a "social documentary" of his own. 
<p>
One night, in 1963, he attended a party for folksinger Pete Seeger in New York. "Jim Forman, head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, was also at the party," Willis recalls, "and he asked Seeger to come down to Mississippi, where a lot of people had been thrown in jail while registering blacks to vote. They wanted to put on a rally in a cotton field. They'd already lined up Theodore Bikel and a young singer named Bob Dylan. On the spot I said, 'Can we come too? We'll make a film.'"
<p>
Willis and two other young men used their savings to buy film stock, found another man who'd actually had some experience behind a camera, and drove to Mississippi, where they filmed not only the cotton-field concert, but the nitty-gritty of the voter-registration drive. The result was a "little film" called The Streets of Greenwood that eventually took top honors at the San Francisco Film Festival and enjoyed both theatrical and television distribution. Willis told himself: "This is what I want to do with my life - make documentaries." 
<p>
Over the next several years that's precisely what he did: wrote, directed, and produced films on such diverse subjects as sharecropping, the advertising industry, Catholic education, and street crime. Between 1966 and 1971 he produced documentaries for National Educational Television, the precursor of the Public Broadcasting Service. Several of his films won prizes. "I considered myself very lucky," he says today. "To think someone was paying me to do that work and have so much fun." 
<p>
The "fun" sometimes included, however, threats, intimidation, and thuggery on the part of local citizens and law officers who viewed the filmmakers as troublemakers - "outside agitators," in the parlance of the times. In Selma, Alabama, Willis's crew was knocked around by Sheriff Jim Clark and his deputies when the journalists inadvertently filmed the site of a Ku Klux Klan meeting. Visiting eastern Kentucky to make a film on Appalachian poverty, Willis arrived not long after the fatal shooting of a Canadian filmmaker. A gun was pointed at Willis too, but not fired. His cameraman was pistol-whipped by a mining-company goon. 
<p>
"In Wilcox County, Alabama," Willis remembers, "a guy came up to me and said, 'You from New York?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'You Jewish?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'I could tell. You've got the map of Jerusalem on your face.'" The man then gave the visitors sixty seconds to get the hell out of town. 
Willis shakes his head at the strange and perilous wonders of those days. "We were so young then," he says, "I don't think we knew enough to be as scared as we probably should have been. But you learn a lot. You meet people you'd never meet otherwise and come to understand the diversity of this country and what that means to all of us."
<p>
In the summer of 1970 Jack Willis was at the top of his game. He had been involved in the filming of a dozen documentaries and the production of a variety of TV shows. He was coproducing The Great American Dream Machine, another Emmy-winning magazine-style show he'd started for NET. He intended to marry a young writer named Mary Pleshette in September. 
<p>
Then, while body surfing off Long Island, Willis caught a bad wave and broke his neck. An operation saved his life, but he was paralyzed from the shoulders down and told that he'd probably never walk again. Twenty-one days after the accident, however, he managed to move the big toe of his left foot. Gradually, some of the feeling and function returned to his lower body, bringing with it, though, a great deal of pain and only limited use of his extremities. After six months of hospitalization and rehab, and the constant encouragement and support of his fiancee, he decided he was ready to resume working. A year later than expected, he and Mary were married. Two years after that, the first of their two daughters was born. 
<p>
"You know," he says, "I've never been able to quite put my finger on what that experience did to me. I was thirty-six years old, had a lot to live for, and without thinking about it too much just sort of charged forward and picked up where I left off. There were people I worked with who said I was a nicer human being after the accident. They said I was more tolerant, I listened better, didn't fly off the handle so quickly. I don't know if that's true, but I'll take their word for it." 
<p>
He says too that while it made his life more difficult, the accident didn't appreciably affect his work. "I'd already decided, before the accident, that documentaries weren't reaching a large enough audience and that I wanted to be involved in programming that was more informative and entertaining, to try to reach more people. That was how Dream Machine got going. That led to The 51st State." The harrowing story of his accident and recovery was the subject of a book, ...But There Are Always Miracles, that he and Mary published in 1974 and a made-for-television movie for which they wrote the screenplay a short time later. 
<p>
"One thing you learn when you go through an experience like that is that there isn't going to be much that can do you in," Willis adds. "It puts everything in perspective - including the fear of failure." 
<p>
<hr align=center width=10%>
<p>

Willis was operating his own independent production company, developing diverse programming for both commercial and public television, when he received a call from Dick Moore in St. Paul in 1989. Moore was calling to see if Willis might be interested in running Twin Cities Public Television.
<p>
"Then I made some calls, asking people about KTCA and the Twin Cities," Willis says. "What I found out was that the station was well-run and respected, and that the community was open to new ways of doing things." 
<p>
Mary Willis says leaving her home town was hard, but she has no regrets. "I think it was very healthy for us to make that move. As much as we both love New York, it wasn't a wrenching decision. For Jack, it was the perfect job at the perfect time. For me, it was a chance to get away from the distractions of the city and finish the novel I was working on. I think we've both seen this as an adventure."
<p>
From the get-go, say Channel 2 staffers, Willis was determined to push his ideal of a local station meeting local needs. "KTCA, for as long as I've been around, has been extraordinarily committed to local production and community service - more than any other facility in the system," says Bill Hanley, a station veteran of seventeen years. "What Jack brought was an almost single-minded focus on the subject." Hanley says that among the several manifestations of Willis's community interest is a dramatic and unprecedented emphasis on youth. "Jack is hot on the idea of producing shows not only for young people but by young people," he says. Don't Believe the Hype is a notable example.
<p>
Catherine Allan, another long-time staff member, points to Willis's commitment to diversity - and not only in the station's programming. "This place was pretty lily-white until Jack got here," says Allan, senior executive producer for national programming. "Jack made it a high priority to bring on people of color at all levels of responsibility. He wasn't satisfied with excuses that this was Minnesota and maybe we didn't have the same ratio of minority members to whites that other places have. He was committed to the idea of diversity because he believed it was right."
<p>
Allan says that Willis was also instrumental in changing the internal architecture of the station, streamlining management while encouraging work teams and other updated operational techniques. And though he comes out of a long career in production, Allan and others say Willis is not one to micromanage over the shoulders of his producers, that he's able to delegate responsibilities effectively and willing to go out on a limb for worthy projects. The best-known of such projects is the widely acclaimed documentary Hoop Dreams, which KTCA produced in cooperation with Kartemquin Films of Chicago. Although Willis was not on board for the project's conception, he was involved in the decision to invest station resources in the project and helped find ways to keep it on track, says Allan, who was the film's coexecutive producer. 
<p>
Still, for everything Willis has been able to accomplish at Channel 2, the station's financing remains a formidable challenge. The threat of elimination of federal money and other financial calamities is never far from the minds of the station's 200 full-time and 60 part-time employees, insiders say. Money from the federally funded Corporation for Public Broadcasting accounts for only about 8 percent of KTCA's $14 million annual operating budget, Willis explains. "But it's with those funds that we buy the PBS programming, which draws most of our money for us. As generous as it is, I can't imagine the local community making that up on a regular basis." 
<p>
Last summer the station roiled with rumors of drastic staffing cutbacks. "The rumors were awful," Willis says. "So we decided to lay everything on the line and be as frank and forthright as we could." (KTCA's books have been open to employees for the past three years.) When the cuts were made, twenty-two full-time positions and four part-time slots were eliminated, most of those through attrition and by transferring employees to other parts of the operation. "It's worked out better than we thought," Willis adds, "but it's been tough."
<p>
Willis says public television in general and KTCA in particular are now looking at a "window of opportunity" afforded by the recent outpouring of support for the CPB and an array of entrepreneurial options that could help make public broadcasting more nearly self-sustaining in years to come. 
<p>
One possibility enjoying some support among lawmakers is the creation of a federal trust fund to replace annual appropriations. Another would involve an oncoming technology called advanced, or high-definition, TV, which public television could parlay into increased channel space to be used for its own broadcasting or to be leased or sold to others. Still other opportunities may derive from the for-profit "enterprise unit" KTCA is establishing to develop tie-ins with popular programs. The station, in conjunction with the 3M Company, is already producing CD-ROM applications based on Newton's Apple, with plans for additional interactive products on laser disk. The station is also marketing its technical and creative capabilities to help companies develop their own information services. 
<p>
By the year's end, Hoop Dreams had netted the station about $750,000. "After foreign sales and so forth," Willis says, "we're optimistic we can make a million or more before we're done." Catherine Allan's series on the American Revolution - its funding nearly complete and scheduled to air on PBS in the fall of 1997 - could be a moneymaker a la Ken Burns's spectacularly successful Civil War, with the healthy potential of selling books, tapes, and other ancillary products.
<p>
"I was an independent long enough to know that entrepreneurs need ten ideas and a lot of time for one of them to hit, so I'm realistic about our prospects," Willis says. "But I do think that if we stick with what we know and if what we do is an offshoot of our educational and community mission, we've got a good chance to open new revenue streams. In the meantime, we have a strong brand name, we're highly thought of in this community, and we have excellent technical capabilities and creative people. I think that puts us in a very good position."
<p>
<hr align=center width=10%>
<p>

Jack Willis is an admired man in his industry, and though he's reluctant to talk about the physical limitations he sustained half a lifetime ago, others inevitably do. Ron Handberg's assessment is typical. "For him to do what he's done with that kind of handicap makes a good man even more remarkable," Handberg says. "I have tremendous respect for Jack." 
<p>
Willis is characteristically direct in describing how, for him, getting older has meant more than the usual aches and pains. "As somebody once said," he says, "'Denial is not a river in Egypt.' It's only been the last seven or eight years that I've no longer been able to deny my limitations and have had to face them. At a certain point God tells you to slow down. On top of that, I've got this body that functions pretty much like an old man's. Those two factors combined meant that I could not deny that I'm handicapped and there are certain things I can't do."
<p>
Abruptly he changes the subject to NewsNight Minnesota's special on Rudy Perpich, whose death had surprised and saddened Minnesotans in late September. What made the show special was not the reminiscences of public-affairs pundits but those of ordinary people from his native Iron Range and other communities around the state. Not exactly the unheard voices of the unserved audience in this instance, but surely some views from the ground up, as Jack Willis would say.
<p>
"We got word he died about noon," Willis says. "Our people tore up what they'd planned to do that night and did an hour special instead. It was so good. I thought, Now that's the kind of service we can provide. I just sat back and watched and said, 'Wow!'"

The tradition of "British Tea"started in England 
in the early 19th century as the time between lunch and dinner 
lengthened.  It is a small meal, slightly more substantial than a snack, 
usually served in the late afternoon.  
<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/invisible_dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="7">
A variety of food is served during "British Tea" such as small dainty 
sandwiches, slices of cake, sweet tarts and scones.  The main beverage 
is, of course, tea!


<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>

(Ingredients are for one sandwich to be cut in 3 sections)
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>3 slices of firm, thinly sliced* white bread
	<LI>2 slices of firm, thinly sliced wheat bread
	<LI>3 tablespoons of strawberry-flavored (or your favorite) cream cheese

</UL><P>
* Very thinly sliced bread can be purchased pre-packaged in most 
markets.<P>
<BR>
Spread the cream cheese on each bread slice as you stack them, starting 
with white, alternating white and wheat. Finish the sandwich with the 
final slice of white, pressing slightly so the layers all stick 
together.<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/invisible_dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="7">
Cut the crusts from the slices of bread carefully with a bread 
knife.  Save the crusts for the birds - or your favorite bread pudding 
recipe. Finally, cut the stack into 1 inch wide "fingers".

Almost every country in the Middle East has a recipe for hummus, a tasty snack or side dish. Hummus is made of ground chickpeas 
(also called garbanzo beans), garlic, lemon juice and tahini which is a 
ground sesame seed butter.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/invisible_dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="7">Pita bread is a small, 
flat, hollow round bread.  When cut into wedges, 
it is used as a "finger scoop" to eat hummus. If pita is heated, it often 
puffs up like a balloon, then deflates immediately upon cooling.<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>2 cups canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
	<LI>1 teaspoon salt
	<LI>1-3 medium garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped
	<LI>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (with pressure, hand roll the lemon to get 
the juices flowing 	before cutting and squeezing)
	<LI>1/2 cup olive oil
	<LI>2 tablespoons tahini/sesame seed butter (usually near peanut butter 
in the store.)
<LI>pita bread
</UL><P>
<BR>
Preparation:<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Place all the ingredients in a blender.  Puree until smooth.<P>
<B>Note:</B> chicken stock can be used as a thinner rather than oil.<P>
	<LI>Chill until ready to serve.<P>
	<LI>Place the <i>pita bread</i> in the microwave for about 30 seconds or in a 
350 degree oven for about 5 minutes or until lightly toasted.<P>
	<LI>Remove pita from the oven or microwave. If it is puffed with steam, 

wait for it to deflate before handling.<P>
	<LI>When it is still warm, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut bite-size wedges 
	which can be dipped like a cracker into the hummus.

</UL><P>
<BR>
Add a selection of sliced vegetables to the presentation which can be dipped in the hummus. 
<p>
Alternative serving: Hummus can be used as a spread in sandwiches.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>1 cup clean sand
	<LI>1/2 cup cornstarch
	<LI>1/2 tsp. alum  (find in spice section of your grocery store)
	<LI>1/2 cup water
</UL><P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Directions:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Pour the sand into an old cooking pot.<P>
	<LI>Add cornstarch, water and alum. Stir.<P>
	<LI>Set the concoction on the stove over medium heat and stir.
As it gets warm it begins to liquefy. In 2-3 minutes it will get thicker.<p>
	<LI>As the goop stiffens and clumps like stiff cookie dough, remove from 
the heat and keep stirring for a few more seconds as it cools down.<P>
	<LI>Plop it onto a cutting board or tough surface, spread it slightly 
for further cooling. When comfortable to touch begin molding and/or 
adhering to chosen frames.
</UL><P>
<BR>
<B>To make a sand frame:</B> <BR>
Arrange and glue a few seashells on a wooden frame with a 1-inch or larger edge.  Use a paintbrush to apply household glue directly onto the frame around the shells.  With your fingers, press a thin layer of sand goop on the glue.  Let dry for 1-2 days.  Brush off any loose sand.<p><BR>

<B>To make a "fossil:"</B><BR>
Form a ball of sand goop (the size of a tennis ball) around a small rubber toy or whimsical plastic trinket. Let dry for a few days until the ball is hard.  Then, tap the ball with a hammer.  
It will crack open to reveal the surprise!

Kid's will love the name of this simple cream colored sweet fudge from India.
 It is eaten as a snack any time of the day and often served with a yogurt/rose water 
beverage. Indians frequently take barfi as a gift when visiting friends.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../resources/invisible_dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="7">
Barfi is a milk fudge treat that can be made with several 
ingredients - nuts, fruits, flour, and even vegetables! The ground 
ingredients are cooked with sugar to a fudge-like consistency. It is 
often decorated with silver foil.<BR>
<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>2 cups blanched almonds, ground finely (using a nut or coffee bean 
grinder is easiest)
	<LI>2 cups whole milk
	<LI>3/4 cup sugar
	<LI>2 tablespoons butter
</UL>
<p>
Preparation:
<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Bring the milk to a boil in a large, heavy saucepan over high heat.<P>
	<LI>Stir constantly at a boil until the milk is reduced by half.<P>
	<LI>Add the sugar, ground nuts and butter.  <P>
	<LI>Continue to cook, stirring until the mixture is stiff 
(about 3 minutes).  It will have the consistency and texture of tapioca.<P>
	<LI>Pour the fudge onto a buttered square of waxed paper, spread it out 
evenly to about 1/2" thickness and let it cool.<P> 
	<LI>Cut the fudge into traditional diamond shapes before serving and, 
for added decoration, add a whole almond to each piece, 
if desired.
</UL><P>
<BR>
<B>Serving option:</B>  a scored mango is a wonderful complement to 
barfi. The mango can be eaten right off the skin... a fun way to 
introduce your children to a new fruit.

Ropa viejas is beef cooked until it is tender enough to shred. The name actually translates as "old clothes" or "rags" - beef that is falling apart like worn clothes. This dish can be found as a staple in many countries in South and Central America. It's very economical because it uses a tough, inexpensive piece of meat.  <P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Step One: Shredded Beef</H3><p>
<H4>Ingredients and Preparation:</H4>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of fat
	<LI>2 scrubbed, sliced carrots 
	<LI>1 sliced onion
</UL>

Place the roast, onions and carrots in a 6 quart casserole. Add just 
enough water to cover about 1/2 inch of the roast. Cover the pan and 
cook at 350 degrees for 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours, depending on the cut of 
beef. When the beef is VERY tender, remove from the pan and cool. 
Using two forks, help your child shred the beef into "rags".<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Step Two: Using the Shredded Beef to make Enchiladas de Ropas Viejas</H3><p>

<H4>Ingredients and Preparation: </H4>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Shredded cooked beef
	<LI>1 red pepper, chopped
	<LI>2 tablespoons fresh chopped cilantro
	<LI>1/4 cup fajita marinade (can be purchased in most markets)
	<LI>1/4 cup mild chilies
	<LI>1/2 cup sour cream
	<LI>8 flour tortillas, warmed in a frying pan on the stove top.
</UL><P>
<BR>
In a large frying pan over medium heat, place the beef, red pepper, 
cilantro, marinade and chilies. Stir to combine and heat the mixture 
until warmed through. Meanwhile, tortillas 
can be wrapped in foil and heated in the oven or briefly dropped onto a 
hot griddle or fry pan until warm.<P>

Place a portion of the meat mixture on a warm flour tortilla. 
Top with a dollop of sour cream and roll up before eating.<P>

Everyone can build their own Ropa Viejas!

When making shapes of fruits:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>To make realistic indentations in strawberries or oranges, roll the

	<LI>For apple or pear stems, use a real stick or twig.<P>
	<LI>To make hair for a goofy face, squeeze the clay through a garlic 
press.<P>
	<LI>After drying for 24 hours, use acrylic tube paints to give your 
creations personality.<P>
	<LI>To color the dough, add a few drops of candy color which can be 
purchased at a craft store (do not use food coloring).
</UL>

If your creations should happen to come apart after they are dry, use 
household glue to re-attach the parts.

Pasta is the favorite national dish of Italy where it is cut into 
a variety of uniquely named shapes. Fresh pasta is a flour, egg and water 
combination that creates a soft dough. This dough is rolled thin, either 
by hand or by a hand-crank pasta machine. The dough can be cut into many 
shapes with many different names, such as spaghetti, lasagna and linguini.  The 
shapes can even be cut to the maker's own design.

The 
pasta or noodles are boiled in water and served with a sauce or cooked 
in broth to make a noodle soup with your favorite vegetables and/or 
meats.<P>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation:</H3>
One serving size:  
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>1 cup flour
	<LI>1 egg
	<LI>1 tablespoon of water
</UL>
<BR>
As people who know pasta will tell you,
the size of the egg and the moisture content of the flour will determine 
exactly how much flour is needed.  The rule is: add as much flour as can 
be absorbed by the egg and water.<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Mound flour on a work surface and make a deep "volcano".<P>
	<LI>Break the egg into the volcano and add water.<P>
	<LI>Beat the egg and water lightly with a fork, being careful not to break down 
the volcano walls.<P>
	<LI>Begin to draw in flour from the inner sides of the volcano.  
(This is a good job for kids to exercise their motor skills and 
patience.)<P>
	<LI>Continue to blend in flour until the dough becomes stiff.  
Eventually using your hands, knead the dough until smooth and stiff.<P>
	<LI>Refrigerate for about 1 hour for easier handling when rolling and 
cutting.
</UL>  
<P> 
To shape the dough, either use a pasta maker or roll out with a rolling 
pin until very thin.  Cut the dough into noodles with a pastry wheel or 
pizza cutter. Place in a pot of boiling water for 2-3 minutes or add to a pot of simmering soup.  Excess uncooked 
pasta dough can be refrigerated in an airtight bag for up to 4 days and 
frozen for a month.<P>
Be creative!  All shapes taste the same!

Groundnut stew is popular in many regions of Africa and around the world.  The recipe is so globally widespread, it

The wonton, translated "swallowing clouds", originated in China. Wonton 
dough is made from flour and water and shaped into thin 2-inch squares. 
This dough can be folded in various ways before cooking and it is often 
filled with ingredients such as meats, cheese, and vegetables. Wontons can 
be cooked by steaming, boiling, or frying in hot oil.<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/invisible_dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="7">
Packaged wonton dough squares may be found in the produce or frozen food 
section of your grocery store and more commonly in Asian markets.<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Shaping the Wonton "Bonnets"</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Place a teaspoon of cream cheese (plain or flavored) in the middle 
of the flat dough. Lightly touch your fingertips into a bowl of water and 
gently moisten the edges of the square.<P>
	<LI>Fold the dough over the filling to form a rectangle and lightly 
press the edges to seal. Before completely sealing, "burp" the dough by 
gently pushing out the excess air.<P>
	<LI>Grasp each side of the folded middle with 
the thumb and forefinger of each hand and pull the edges down and 
together.<P>
	<LI>Press and secure one end on top of the other using a dab of water in 
between the sections to form a seal. The rectangle shape will fold over 
the filling to form a "bonnet".
</UL><P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Cooking</H3>
Wonton bonnets are usually deep fried until crispy and golden in peanut 
oil heated to 350 degrees in the traditional Chinese cooking pan, the 
wok.
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Test the readiness of the oil by dipping in a chopstick. When tiny bubbles cluster around the chopstick and rise to the surface, 
the oil is hot enough for frying.<P>
	<LI>The wonton can be placed in the oil and taken out with tongs or a 
common wok tool, the long handled woven wire spatula.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Children should be carefully supervised around the wok to 
avoid small oil splashes while an adult does the frying.<P>
	<LI>When the "bonnets" are done, place them on a paper towel to drain 
and cool.
</UL><P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Serving</H3>
As an appetizer, wonton are eaten plain or are often dipped in a sweet 
and sour sauce. When filled with sweet cream cheese, sprinkle with powdered 
sugar and serve as a dessert.

The French are famous for their "trick-of-the-eye" 
cuisine.  The most famous being the candy truffle which is in the shape 
of the mushroom-like root, but is actually made of chocolate.
The marzipan potato is another example in which one food is created to look
like another.  It is a wonderfully rich 
dessert that looks like the vegetable!  The "skin" of the this "potato" is almond paste, a popular French candy made 
of ground almonds that is very popular in France. The pulp
is a chocolate cake mixture. <P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>2 cups finely crumbled chocolate cake
	<LI>1/2 cup chopped walnuts
	<LI>1/4 cup apricot preserves
	<LI>1 (7 ounce) roll almond marzipan paste (in the baking section of 
grocery store.)
	<LI>1/4 cup cocoa powder
	<LI>1/4 cup slivered almonds
</UL><P>
<BR>
Preparation:<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>In a large bowl combine the cake crumbs with the walnuts and apricot 
preserves.  Mixing with your hands works best - kids will love this 
step!<P>
	<LI>When evenly mixed, take approximately 1/4 cup of the crumb mixture 
and shape it into irregular oval "logs". <P>
	<LI>Wash your hands and get ready to make the potato skins!<P>
	<LI>Cut the roll of almond paste into 6 equal pieces (medallions).<P>
	<LI>Place a piece between two sheets of waxed paper and roll out into a 
5 inch circular disk.<P>
	<LI>Remove the waxed paper and wrap the disk around the oval-shaped cake 
mixture log.<P>
	<LI>Fold in all edges and press together to seal. If there is extra "skin", just pull it away and use on another 
"potato."<P>
	<LI>The finished shape should resemble a small russet potato. Divets and dents make it look realistic.<P>
	<LI>Roll the marzipan-covered "potato" in the cocoa powder.<P>
	<LI>Insert a few slivered almonds to resemble slightly sprouted potato 
eyes.  
</UL><P>
<BR>
<H3>Serving:</H3><p>

Place several "potatoes" in a small basket or bowl and present them as a dessert.  After tricking everyone, slice into 1/2" thick 
sections and place on a pretty dish for serving.

Tapas originated in Andalucia, a Southern province of Spain. The word 
"tapa" translates as "cover". Tapas traditionally may have been a 
complementary piece of sliced ham served on top of a glass of sherry, but 
we know them today as small portions of food commonly served as a snack before 
lunch or dinner. Tapas can be as simple as a bowl of olives or more
hearty, such as these stuffed potatoes.<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>6 small red new potatoes
	<LI>1/2 cup sour cream
	<LI>optional toppings-crumbled bacon, chopped herbs, finely chopped hard 
boiled egg yolks
</UL><P>
<BR>
Preparation:<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Cut each potato in half and trim off a thin slice on the round 
bottoms so they sit upright.<P>
	<LI>Place them on a microwave-safe plate, cover with plastic wrap, and 
heat in the microwave for about 4 minutes on high temp. If you don't have 
a microwave, bake the potatoes for about 1/2 hour in a 350 degree oven 
until they become tender, then remove and allow to cool.<P>
	<LI>Scoop out a small portion of the center with a spoon 
or melon baller.<P>
	<LI>Fill the holes with a dollop of sour cream and the 
toppings of your choice.
</UL><P>
<BR>    

Tapas are good at room temperature, and they are a healthy afternoon 
snack the kids can create themselves. (Parents can cook the potatoes 
ahead of time if the kids are too young to use the microwave or oven.) 
Or if you're preparing for a party, let your child help you make tapas as an appetizer. They'll have fun and 
feel like they're part of the festivities.

This Native American bread is a specialty in the Southwest, especially in the 
Navajo and Hopi Nations. Fry bread is a thin round of dough puffed 
like a giant doughnut without a hole in the middle. It can be a complement 
to savory foods or it can serve as a sweet when drizzled with honey and powdered sugar.  
It's commonly enjoyed as "street food" at festivals and celebrations.<P>
<BR>


<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>2 cups flour
	<LI>1 tablespoon baking powder
	<LI>1 teaspoon salt
	<LI>1 tablespoon oil (peanut oil is best)
	<LI>3/4 cup warm water
	<LI>Peanut or other vegetable oil for frying
</UL><P>
<BR>
Preparation:<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl, then stir in the 
water and oil.<P>
	<LI>Knead the dough lightly until it is smooth and elastic. <P>
	<LI>Shape the dough into a ball, place it in a sealable plastic bag and 
refrigerate for about an hour.<P>
	<LI>Form the chilled dough into 12 small balls and flatten them with 
your hands, then roll into circles about 4-5 inches in diameter.  Let the 
circles rest for 5 minutes and roll them again, expanding to 7-8 inch 
circles, creating a fairly thin disk.<P>
	<LI>Place the dough circles, one at a time, into a deep skillet in oil 
that is 375 degrees.  Fry 1 minute on each side. <P>
	<LI>Remove the fry bread from the oil with tongs and drain on a paper 
towel.
</UL><P>
<BR>
Kids will have fun drizzling honey and 
dusting the bread with powdered sugar.

Chocolate modeling clay is made by combining melted chocolate and light 
corn syrup.  American pastry chefs invented the recipe and have been 
using this delicious edible clay to make garnishes and unique decorations.  Here is 
their secret!<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>10 ounces of chocolate (chopped chunks or chips)
	<LI>1/3 cup light corn syrup
</UL><P>

<B>Note:</B> the chocolate can be substituted with almond bark, or 
colored candy disks to create different colored flowers<P>
<BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Melt the chocolate in a microwave for 1 minute. Stir.  
If chocolate is not completely melted, return to the microwave for 30 
seconds at a time and stir until smooth. If you don't have a 
microwave, place the chocolate in the top of a double broiler over hot 
water and stir until melted.<P>

	<LI>When the chocolate is melted, add the corn syrup and blend.<P>
	<LI>Pour the mixture onto a waxed paper sheet.<P>
	<LI>Spread the chocolate with your fingers until it's about 1/2 inch 
thick. <P>
	<LI>Cover loosely with waxed paper and let it stiffen for at least a 
couple hours or overnight.  The chocolate will become very pliable.
</UL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Making a Chocolate Rose:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Have the kids roll 10 marble-sized balls out of the chocolate 
clay.<P>
	<LI>Place the balls on a waxed paper sheet, about 1 inch apart.<P>
	<LI>Place another waxed paper sheet on top.  Big or little thumbs can 
press each marble into a flat disk (about the size of a quarter).  
Use some pressure!
</UL><P>
<BR>
To form the rose:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Remove 1 disk and curl it into a "teepee" shape, narrow at 
the top and wider at the bottom.<P>
	<LI>Wrap the next disk around the opening of the teepee and the third 
disk at the back of the teepee.
</UL><P>
This is the rose bud.  Continue adding disks which will look like petals.  
Continue to layer them to create a rose in bloom.<P>

Roses can be used as edible decorations for a cake or to create a basketful of blooms.  They will harden after a few days and can be saved by storing 
in a cool, dry place.<P>
Since this recipe is the consistency of modeling clay, you can mold any shape you want.

As you might have guessed from the name, this very thin pancake hails 
from Sweden. Swedish Pancakes can be served for breakfast, but Swedes prepare them for supper accompanied with a bowl of hearty pea soup.<BR><IMG SRC="../resources/invisible_dot.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="7">Unlike the thicker American "flap jack", the 
Swedish pancake is more like the French crepe. Rather than syrup, the 
pancakes are usually garnished with lingonberries, a tart, or red berry 
and sprinkled with powdered sugar.<P>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation:</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>3 eggs
	<LI>2 1/2 cups milk
	<LI>1 1/4 cup flour
	<LI>1 tablespoon sugar
	<LI>1/2 teaspoon salt
	<LI>2 tablespoons melted butter
	<LI>1/2 teaspoon vanilla, optional
</UL><P>
<BR>In a blender, combine all the ingredients above until smooth.<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Heat a 10 inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until very hot.<P>

	<LI>Lightly butter the skillet and pour 1/2 cup of the batter into it. <P>
	<LI>Swirl the pan with batter to expand to a thin layer. <P> 
	<LI>Cook until bubbles form and the pancake is golden brown on the bottom, about 1-1/2 
minutes. Flip turn and continue to cook for 
about one more minute. <P>
	<LI>Remove from the fry pan.
It should not be necessary to add more butter to the pan for more 
pancakes.
</UL><P>
<BR>When finished, fold each pancake into quarters. Top with the traditional dollop of lingonberries 
or other fruit of your choice and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Hamantashen is a tri-cornered cookie often holding sweet fillings of 
honey-poppy seed, prune or apricot. They're one of the traditional
	sweets of Purim, a festive Jewish holiday.

But don't wait for Purim, prepare these wonderful cookies with 
your family all year around!<P>
<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Ingredients and Preparation</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>2 cups flour
	<LI>2 teaspoons baking powder
	<LI>1/4 teaspoon salt
	<LI>1 stick butter, cut into small pieces
	<LI>1 egg, beaten

	<LI>Dab a teaspoon of your favorite filling on the center of 
each circle.<P>
	<LI>Fold the edge of the circle inward toward the center in thirds to 
form a triangle shape.<P>
	<LI>Lightly pinch together 3 edges of the 3 joined sections of dough, 
leaving a small opening in the center for the filling to peek through.<P>

	<LI>Bake on a cookie sheet covered with a sheet of parchment paper for 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven. <P>

The 14th season of 
<b>
NEWTON'S APPLE
</b>
gets underway in super subterranean style, as 
<b>
David Heil
</b>
explores the geological wonders of the underground world of Carlsbad Caverns National Park in Carlsbad, N.M. 
<p>
<p>
From the darkness of the subterranean world, the season's first show heads back to the warehouse to shed some light on the miracle of sight. 
<b>
SuChin Pak
</b>
and expert Dr. Bruce Dan eyeball some giant models to explain how we see. 
<p>
<p>
For the peripatetic autograph hound of "Science of the Rich and Famous," eyes aren't the issue. 
<b>
Betty White
</b>
and Hercules the kitty give our celeb fan the facts on how felines purr. 
<p>
<p>
<b>
NEWTON'S APPLE
</b>
adds a new member to its team of science adventurers. Eileen Galindo racks up a great finale for the season opener, chewing the oats with a herd of elk.

</b>
as 
<b>
SuChin Pak
</b>
and 
<b>
Dave Huddleston
</b>
pack up their grass skirts and ukuleles for a sojourn in the heart of Polynesia--the island paradise of Tahiti. 
<p>
<p>
Dave has a rendezvous with marine biologist Dick Johnson and divemaster Yves LeFevre at Rangiroa Atoll. The three divers head under the waves to make the acquaintance of a some white tip reef sharks. 
<p>
<p>
Next, SuChin and Dave investigate a Tahitian cultural practice to dye for--tattooing. This art form has been important to Tahitians because its forms depict big events in the wearers' lives. 
<p>
<p>
From the Tuolmoto Archipelago north of Tahiti, SuChin files an absolute gem of a story. Pearl farmer Joel Hart introduces her to pinctada margarita fera, the oyster that makes black pearls. 
<p>
<p>
And as he sinks slowly into the Polynesian sunset, Dave goes coconuts trying to figure out how everyone's favorite tropical nut propagates itself from island to island.

The gravity of the situation is obvious on this segment of

NEWTON'S APPLE

, as 
<b>
Dave Huddleston
</b>
and a few coaster-connoisseur friends check out the new 20-story-tall Wild Thing hypercoaster at Valleyfair amusement park in Shakopee, Minn. And their question is: How can you make such a bodacious, jaw-dropping ride safe and predictable? To get at the physics of coaster design, Morgan Manufacturing engineer Steve Okamoto joins Huddleston to show how he put the adrenaline and the safety into his mile-long creation. 
<p>
<p>
Dr. Bruce Dan joins 
<b>
Brian Hackney

to reveal the secrets behind nicotine's potent power to addict. The best way to handle tobacco, of course, is to never start using it in the first place.

<p>
What does a brilliant artiste like

SuChin Pak

<p>
<p>
Finally, this edition of "Science at Work," NEWTON'S APPLE'S newest feature, visits the Milwaukee High School of the Arts, where student dancers and their teachers show how science and the old soft-shoe go together like peaches and cream.

Among the world's extinct civilizations few offer the fascinations and riddles of the great Inca empire of South America's Andes Mountains. This week on

cohosts

David Heil

and

head for Peru and the world's second highest mountain range to uncover the secrets of the Incas. 
<p>
<p>
Like the ancient Egyptians, the Incas had a knack for massive construction projects. But unlike Egypt's flatlanders, they had to engineer for and build on some of the most mountainous real estate in the world. David and Professor Luiz Castillo of the Catholic University of Lima walk some of the paved Incan road system, which at 14,000 miles was longer than that of the Roman Empire. 
<p>
<p>
David is counting on Eileen to get him a tally of potatoes for his next segment. So she recruits cultural archaeologist Elva Torres to help her figure out how to use a quipu to inventory those spuds. Quipus are colored strings that the Incas--who had no written language--used to count and record things.
<p>
With quite enough taters to work with here in the "birthplace" of the spud, David and crop specialist Dr. Carlos Avellaneda set to work making chuno, by stomping on the veggies. Why? Because most of the 220 species of potatoes are poisonous. However, when these mashed tough tubers are exposed to the sun, the toxins in them evaporate away.
<p>
<p>
There's nothing tough, however, about the wool of the alpaca. It's one of the softest, finest fibers in the world. Eileen gets acquainted with this humpless camel of the Andes with a bit of help from Professor Jorge Flores of the University of Cuzco.

This week someone nearly gets a bee in his bonnet while pursuing a very interesting story out in California. And his name is 
<b>
David Heil
</b>
. The intrepid science reporter's mission is a real honey: To find out what happens when you get stung by a bee. 
<p>
<p>
Next, 
<b>
Brian Hackney

There's nothing jittery about a cow calmly chewing her cud. But what's cud and why does she chew it?

<strong>Dave searches the Amazon jungle for insects with very unusual habits.

<td valign=top>
<p>
For this tropical extravaganza on 
<b>
NEWTON'S APPLE, David Heil
</b>
and 
<b>
Dave Huddleston
</b>
make a science sojourn in the heart of Peru's Amazon rain forest, one of the richest, most complex ecosystems in the world. 
<p>
<p>
Rain forest researcher Dr. James Duke from the Amazon Center for Environmental Education Research (ACEER) shows David that there's a good reason why trees in the rain forest grow large projections on their trunks called plank buttresses. 
<p>
<p>
When Dave joins expert Barry Wakeman and some students in the next segment, there's concern that what they catch packs a poisonous punch. The little snake resembles a deadly coral snake and Wakeman plays it safe, treating it as if it had fangs and venom. 
<p>
<p>
What's most dangerous to soon-to-be-hatched rain forest frogs is other frogs--their brothers and sisters, in fact. Frog researcher Lynn Haugen from ACEER tells David that the first-hatched tadpoles eat their unhatched siblings because there's no other chow in the water inside the bromeliad plants where the eggs are laid. 
<p>
<p>
Queen leaf-cutting ants lay a lot more eggs than that, enough to populate a 50-foot nest with millions of ants. Insect curator Randy Morgan and Huddleston excavate a nest's fungus garden chamber to illustrate how symbiosis makes the ants' success possible.

NEWTON'S APPLE
</b>
satellite technology tracks the malaria-carrying mosquitoes of the Amazon rain forest. 
<b>
David Heil
</b>
and 
<b>
Dave Huddleston
</b>
track down the trackers.
<p>
<p>
In the Peruvian town of Iquitos, David visits with researchers Yvonne Mejia and Fernando Rodriguez, who show him images of their neck of the Amazon woods, taken by Landsat satellite. Meanwhile, out on the river, Dave and Roger Mustalish of the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research (ACEER) are hunting for larvae of the anopheles mosquitoes that pose a malaria danger. 
<p>
<p>
With a little time on her hands in Switzerland, 
<b>
Eileen Galindo

sets out to see what makes clocks and watches tick. For his part, 
<b>
Brian Hackney
</b>
takes a spin in the Barrel of Fun--a top invention from the Science Museum of Minnesota's Young Inventor's Fair. 
<p>
<p>
And thank some more school kids for jumping into the science headlines with news no one wanted to hear--seriously deformed frogs have turned up in Minnesota.

<b>Newton's Apple</b> launches its 14th season with not just 13 new episodes on PBS, 
but a host of exciting new science "edutainment" products -- from CD-ROMs to live theater.
 A principal component of the new Enterprise initiative at KTCA-TV in St. Paul, the 
 <b>Newton's Apple</b> product line is part of a broad effort to generate new revenues 
 for Public Television.
<dl>
<dt>Teacher's Guides
<dd>Season 14 guides will be available soon from the <a href="http://ericir.syr.edu">AskEric library 
</a>of educational resources at Syracuse, and at Newton's home base, 
<http://www.ktca.org/newtons/alpha.html>KTCA-Twin Cities Public TV</A>.  Also 
downloadable are lesona and activities associated with season 9-13.  For hard copy compilations
of past seasons' guides, call the National Science Teacher's Association at 800-722-NSTA.  
Or to receive a free hardcopy of upcoming seasons' guides, send us an 
<A HREF="mailto:newtons.apple@umn.edu">email</A>.



as well as <A HREF="alpha.html">here</A> on The Tube within 
Minnesota Online. Educational materials are also available on the science forums of other 
commercial services, such as CompuServe and America Online. 

<dt>CD-ROM:
<dd>The most important <b>Newton's Apple</b> spin-off product launched 3M Learning 
Software, a business unit of the 3M Company. That product was the CD-ROM <a href="secret.html">
<i>What's the Secret?</i></a>, based on <b>Newton's Apple</b> science adventures. The first 
<i>What's the Secret? </i>was produced in collaboration with Iconos, a multimedia development 
firm in Minneapolis, and was released one year ago. As the first commercial CD-ROM title based 
on a PBS series released to the home market, it received a number of awards and high ratings 
from reviewers. The second volume of <i>What's the Secret? </i>was released in the fall of 
1995 with a new roster of subjects and features. Work is already under way on subsequent 
titles in the series.
<p>
<dt>Videodiscs:
<dd>The first two <b>Newton's Apple</b> videodiscs -- providing comprehensive video and 
computer resources for the classroom -- reached the marketplace in late 1994. Distributed
 by the National Geographic Society's Educational Media Division, this project was made
  possible by a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSF 
  recently announced a second grant to continue the production of additional 
  <b>Newton's Apple</b> videodiscs. A series of six videodiscs with companion CD-ROMs 
  is planned. The first of the new volumes will be released for the 1996 school year.
<p>
<dt>Science Kits:
<dd><b>Newton's Apple</b> has formed a partnership with the Wild Goose Company of Salt 
Lake City, an innovative creator of hands-on science products. Together they'll create
 a line of science kits based on the program. Four colorful kits will be released in the 
 fall of 1995, including "Slime Chemistry" and "Newton's Laws."
<p>
<dt>Live, In-school Theater Programs:
<dd>Fall 1995 will see the premiere of a children's theater production called <i>Newton's 
Apple Live. </i>Through a fanciful drama about a young girl's fear of thunderstorms, the 
play will explore and demonstrate basic science concepts. Produced by the Small Change Original 
Theater of Minneapolis, the production will tour grade schools and middle schools nationwide, 
and will also provide teacher resources and classroom materials.
<p>
<dt>International Distribution:
<dd><b>Newton's Apple</b> is poised for significant growth in international markets. 
In collaboration with Pro TV of Australia, KTCA is developing a new international format 
for distribution to foreign countries. This format will combine existing video from 
the extensive <b>Newton's Apple</b> library with new science segments taped with personalities
 in the individual countries, to create a tailored, "local" version of the program. The goal
  is to create for international audiences the kind of accessible science television that 
  has become the hallmark of <b>Newton's Apple</b>.

<strong><p>Saturday, December 7, 12:30 PM</p>
</strong>
<IMG SRC="Sundaelarge.gif89" HSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=320>
<p>The holidays are here, and with them comes the annual rush of dinner parties, delicious confections for school and office, and special treats for the kids. In HOLIDAY COOKING SECRETS OF THE CIA, chefs from the world-famous Culinary Institute of America -- regarded as the Harvard of cooking schools -- present some wonderful and magical holiday delicacies.</p>
<p>Each recipe featured in HOLIDAY COOKING SECRETS OF THE CIA is presented by one of the Institute's chef-instructors, many of them certified master chefs. These highly regarded chefs reveal cooking tips and techniques as they prepare wonderful, magical holiday fare, including edible centerpieces, tempting hors d'oeuvres, traditional favorites and elegant desserts.</p>
<p>Viewers learn to create easy and impressive holiday arrangements, including a broccoli wreath, a sushi snowman and a pineapple candie. Combining some basic ingredients creates delicious and eye-catching hors d'oeuvres -- almond and cream cheese pinecone canapes and a beautiful brie cheese tort with salmon and dill. And later in the program, parents and children share culinary camaraderie by building a delectable gingerbread house. </p>

<break clear=all>
<strong><p>Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, January 5-7 at 9 PM on Channel 2</p>
</strong></center>
<p>One of the greatest novels of our time comes to public television in a lavish international production capturing the love, honor, obsession and greed of a mythical South American country in the 1890s. Shot entirely on location in Cartegena de Indias, Colombia, Joseph Conrad's Nostromo stars Colin Firth, Albert Finney and Claudia Cardinala, along with an international cast featuring Italian film star Claudio Amendoh in the title role. </p>
<p>In the imaginary republic of Costaguana, where the Andes plunge down to a tropical paradise, there are fortunes to be made. Englishman Charles Gould has arrived with his wife to take over the family's closed silver mine, which may yet yield great wealth. Gould's obsession to make the mine productive works on the people of Costaguana like a dangerous drug, energizing them and plunging them into a morass of corruption, betrayal and revolution as the shining bullion mounts up.</p>
<p>Throughout it all, there is only one man who is reliable beyond question: Nostromo, the proud leader of the local dockworkers, whose name means "our man." To him falls the duty of saving the mine and its treasure when civil war engulfs the country.</p>
<p>Critics have hailed the original novel, published in 1904, as indisputably one of the greatest of the 20th century -- a South American War and Peace that probes the actions, emotions and destinies of people who are caught in epic forces beyond their control.</p>

KENNETH FRAZELLE</A>
<P>
The San Francisco Examiner has said that Kenneth Frazelle's music "came straight from 
-- and went straight to -- the heart, an organ too seldom addressed by contemporary 
composers." Mr. Frazelle's works have been performed by renowned musicians including 
pianist Gilbert Kalish and mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani, the Israel Chamber Orchestra, 
the Colorado Symphony, the Kansas City  Symphony, and The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra
 conducted by John Adams.

<a name=vernon> VERNON REID </A> 
<P>
Before the 1984 inception of his Living Colour ensemble, which has won two Grammy 
Awards, two MTV Music Video Awards, and two International Rock Awards among others,
 Mr. Reid built a solid reputation as a guest guitarist on the records of Jack DeJohnette,
  Public Enemy, B.B. King, The Ramones, Mariah Carey, Mick Jagger, Tracy Chapman,
  Family Stand, Carlos Santana, and others. Around the same time, Mr. Reid and 
  journalist Greg Tate formed the Black Rock Coalition whose stated purpose is to 
  promote a new freedom of expression for black musicians. As a composer, Mr. Reid has
   written music for Marlies Yearby's "Moving Spirits " Dance Co., and for 
   choreographer Ralph Lemon. He composed the music for the multimedia project Afrerica
    in collaboration with Darius Jones for the Brooklyn Council on the Arts. Recently
    Mr. Reid scored for the film Fresh Kill, directed by Shu Lea Cheang, which 
    premiered this year at the Berlin Film Festival.

<STRONG>Black Kites</STRONG>,  is a short experimental film directed 
and edited by <A HREF="atv12bios.html#andres">Jo Andres</A>.
The work is based on the 1992 journals and drawings of Bosnian visual artist Alma 
Hajric.  Along with her friends from the Obala Art Center, she was forced to take 
shelter in the basement theater of the Drama Academy to survive the siege of her
 hometown, Sarajevo. The film focuses on the woman's interior landscape-- her hopes,
  fears, dreams  -- interwoven with daily acts of existence.  
  <P>
  ...
  <P>

The fantasy sequences are influenced by Andres' more recent film work, which, in 
conjunction with theatrical performances, place an emphasis on experimental imagery, 
perceptual trickery, and use manipulated projection screens to create a holographic
 effect on stage.  
 <P>
 ....
 <P>

Collaborators on Black Kites  include: award-winning cinematographer Lisa Rinzler 
(Menace II Society, True Love, Gun Crazy, and Wim Wenders' latest feature); actor 
Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs, In the Soup, Living in Oblivion, Fargo),  and Besse 
Award-winning performer/vocalist Mimi Goese.  Mira Furlan, one of the most famous 
stage and film actresses of former Yugoslavia, narrates the film.

Magical Flowers  is a  short narrative film by Montreal-based filmmaker 
<A HREF="atv12bios.html#vallee">Jean-Marc 
Vallee</A>.  In the film, a dreamy boy tells us how he thinks he can cure his alcoholic
 father. Using magical flowers, he uses his private words and gestures to change
  reality. His magic is his only hope to break the grim cycle of behaviors in his 
  family.

Magical Flowers  is a film about childhood.  It's about the unconditional love of
  a child for his parents.  It's the sensitive and naive point of view of a child 
  on his family, and more precisely, on his father's strange illness, alcoholism.

<P>





A Maybe Day in Kazakstan is a poignant essay piece by director <A HREF="atv12bios.html#kidel"> 
Mark Kidel</A>. from a poem by Tony Harrison.  The work looks at the aftermath of the major political changes
 in the former Soviet Union. The slippery word 'democracy' is examined in the context 
 of the aspirations of ordinary people and is compared and contrasted with the original
  Greek experiment in democracy.  The measured cadences of Harrison's poetry gives the
   work a haunting Homeric quality and Kidel's direction puts the viewer in the place 
   of the alternately hopeful and bewildered Kazakh people.

Written and performed by<A HREF="atv12bios.html#pate"> Alexs Pate </A> and
<A HREF="atv12bios.html#mura">  David Mura </A>and directed by 
<A HREF="atv12bios.html#jafa"> Arthur Jafa </A>, 
Slowly, This is a strong look at cultural identity in the 90's.
When two friends meet for drinks in a crowded Manhattan restaurant, something takes
 place that is virtually unseen in American media: a Japanese American man and an 
 African American man engaged in intimate conversation about their lives. The two men,
  writers David Mura and Alexs Pate, tell provocative, personal stories that overturn
   stereotypes of how men of color relate to each other.  Wrapped in a stunning visual
    tapestry created by director Arthur Jafa, Mura and Pate quietly unravel their 
    secrets for survival in a white world, and provide new insight into the state of
     race relations in the U.S.

<h3>Jim Kron, Director of Photography</h3><p>

Hi my name is Jim Kron the Director of Photography for Bring Warm Clothes.
I've been at Ch. 2 for about six years working on various projects for Public,
Community, Arts and Cultural Affairs. Some of the highlights were the award
winning Minnesota "Diaries" that focused on  various individual's from
Minnesota's minority communities. "Get Over It" a documentary on  gay rights
issue's that ended up with a march on Washington D.C. and gave me the chance to
receive an Emmy for videography. At the same time I have been shooting  video
all along for Almanac, Newsnight, Tapes Rolling and The News Hour.      <p>
I'm originally from Duluth Mn. graduated from the College of Saint Scholastica
with a B.A. in Media Arts with an emphasis on still photography. From my last
year in college to present I have been working shooting video for broadcast
television and keeping my still photography as a hobby<p>
My wife Nancy and I have been married for 12 years and have lived in south
Minneapolis for almost 10 years. No children as of yet just our 10 year old
golden retriever Bozwell.<p>
<p>
<br>
<a name="lakso"></a>
<h3>Jerry Lakso, Editor</h3><p>

I have 20 years of production and broadcasting experience in public and
commercial television.  For the past 18 years, I have been employed by Twin
Cities Public Television, KTCA-TV Channel 2, where I have had extensive
experience in post-production, field and studio production, and broadcast
operations.  During my tenure here my skills have grown as KTCA has become one
of the top production facilities in the PBS system.  (On the down side my
Resume and cover letter writing skills may have gotten a bit rusty.)<p>
	From 1985 to 1991 I was the principal editor of the Emmy Award winning
<i>Newtons Apple</i>  series.  In1989 I traveled to England where I worked with
the BBC and Visnews as Associate Producer/Technical Coordinator on, <i>Carols
from Kings</i>, a BBC / KTCA co-production. (it's nice to get out of town once
in a while, don't you think?).  I have also edited for <i>MacNeil/Lehrer
Newshour</i>  as well as numerous documentaries for local, state and national
distribution. In 1991, I was awarded an EMMY for my editing work on the
documentary <i>KMOJ: Heart and Soul</i>.  I've also had the pleasure to work
with the Producer of <i>Bring Warm Clothes</i>, Barbara Wiener, on many other
productions like <i>Wacipi/Pow Wow</i> and <i>A Family Concert</i> and many
others.<p>

<b>
<img src=images/soapbox.jpg width=198 height=279 align=right>These are
true stories from some of the people who settled here.  People whose courage
and fears, humor and hardships helped shape who we Minnesotans are today.
These are not the stories of governors, business leaders, or other popular
figures whose achievements and mishaps are chronicled in history books,
newspapers and other scholarly publications and official documents  of the times.  These are the stories of
lumberjacks, soldiers, homemakers, farmers--ordinary people who left us their
life stories in the form of letters, diaries and photographs.  They knew how
good and how brutal the good old days were--they lived them.<p>
<p>
Experience Minnesota history through <b><i>Bring Warm
Clothes: </i>Online</b>  Discover the personal stories explored in the
documentary; visit the historic sites where the program was shot; trace your
ancestry and learn how to preserve the photos and momentos of your own history;
contribute to this program by sharing with us and other Minnesotans your
Minnesota experience and that of your ancestors; and more...so get <a href=index.html>started</a><b></b><p>

Beyond the books of scholars and official documents, there are other sources for discovering history -- 
sources which reveal history as experienced directly by the people who lived it. It is the personal letters and diary entries of past generations that today provide the content for 


<a href="../prodteam.html#meier">Peg Meier's</a> book <b><i>Bring Warm Clothes</b>, and shape KTCA's TV documentary.<p>
To give it structure, producer <a href="../prodteam.html#wiener">Barbara Wiener</a> has organized the program into several loosely defined "eras" of Minnesota history.  Think of it as a supplement to Minnesota's family scrapbook.  Clearly history itself is less tidy.

Old newspapers, of course, provide an excellent source of information about the day to day concerns, perspectives and living circumstances of people living in times past.  <img src=images/svenska.jpg height=102 width=350 align=right alt="Newspaper">By 1852, there were already 3 weekly newspapers published in Saint Paul alone.<p>

Frequently advertisements hailed Minnesota's virtues and riches, beckoning East coasters to the promised land of plenty -- plenty of winter, that is...  Many an article failed to mention the tougher sides of life in the North,  as the following excerpts indicate.

Tables of mortality show there is no city in the United States so healthy as
St. Paul.  We walked through every prominent street and found only one
undertakers shop, and on the door was a placard: No admittance except on
business.  Business was so poor that the owner, no doubt, had too many friends
who make his shop a lounging place.  He will have to move away or open a lager
beer saloon.<p>

And during threshing times, the wages are $2 a day, the immigrants and other

there is someone after them who wants to hire them.<p>

WARNING! There is a reaper whose name is Death; and since no one can tell when he will thrust in his sickle and cut us off from life, nowis the time to have your Picture taken at Whitney's Gallery, ---where as good a Daguerroeotype can be procured as any other establishment in the world.<p>

Some journeymen preacher would make a profitable trip up the Mississippi River, with a supply of blank marriage licesnes, there being no person north of St. Paul who is authorized by law to tie the nuptial knot.  Many couples are represented to be in an unlawful state of suspense.  More properly imagined, than described.<p>

A new invention has been made by a Swede, by name Per O. Elliot, 905 Washington Ave. S.  It is a simple little apparatus designed to aid in attaching the postage stamp to a letter thus making it unnecessary to fumble around with big and clumsy fingers in an attempt to affix it.  As soon as the inventor receives the patent papers he will sell his invention, preferably to a Swede.
Several prospective buyers have already contacted him.<p>

Never was a city laid out so badly as St. Paul.  The plat of the town with its numerous additons looks as if some accident had knocked all the streets into pi.  Measures should be taken immediately to straighten and reform them as far as practical, before it is too late.<p>

A blood curdling murder occured at Wells on Wednesday.  Henry Ringer, owner of a meat market was stabbed to death with a huge butcher knife by a man in his employ named korr.  Briefly told, RInger, suspecting improper relations between Korr and his wife, came home clandestinely and secreted himself under the bed, and was discovered by Korr who supposing him to be a burglar killed him instantly.  It is a sad state of affairs in which a wife's infidelity seems to have been the inciting cause.<p>

<h3>LIVING HISTORY: Historic sites to visit in Minnesota</h3></table>

<p>
How do you make a historical documentary with dramatic reenactments requiring
authentic locations, big costumes and lots of funny hair on a public television
budget?  </h3><p>
<p align=right>Photo courtesy of Sterns County Historical Society</p>
<img src=images/wheat.jpg height=228 width=288 align=right>Well, if you live in a place like the Twin Cities, you are in luck,
because our area is home to some spectacular LIVING HISTORY sites.  
KTCA's documentary based on <a href="prodteam.html#meier">Peg Meier's</a> book,<i><b> Bring Warm Clothes</b>
</i>had some remarkable partners involved in its creation.  They helped provide
the elements to paint the pictures of everyday life in early Minnesota.<p>
<p>
How people lived in early Minnesota before electricity and
central heating is truly fascinating to see.  And here in Minnesota, we are
lucky to have many locations that are preserved historic sites.  That means you
and your family can personally visit the 1800s.  Walking through an historic
site is a very different experience from watching it on television or flipping
through a picture book.  The personal items of the people who might have lived
there--the sound of your feet on the wooden floors--this all gives you an
understanding of our own  past.  The following locations used in  Bring Warm
Clothes are also available for your own adventures.<p>

<ul>

<p>

Much of the period clothing was provided by<br>
<li><b>THE MINNESOTA OPERA COSTUME COLLECTION.</b><p>
When you look at historic photos you see the kinds of faces that you still see
all around you today.  What you don't see all around you are the clothes.  What
people wore tell us a lot about what their lives and ideas were like.  For
<i>Bring Warm Clothes</i>, we had the help of the Minnesota Opera<b>
</b>costume collection and the  spectacular Minnesota Opera costume designer,
Gail Bakkum.  While the Opera often creates the regalia of the courts, they
also have an extensive collection of 19th century costumes.  The Minnesota
Opera's collection is available for rental at reasonable prices--and you don't
have to sing to wear the outfits.  For more information on costume rental call
333-2700.  However, if you do want to see someone who <u>can</u> sing wear
these exquisite creations, the Minnesota Opera season includes: <i>La
Boheme</i>, January 20 - 28; <i>Don Giovanni</i>, March 9 - 17; <i>Pelleas and
Melisande</i>, April 26 - May 4 and <i>The Tales of Hoffmann,</i> June 8 - 15.
Tickets range from $17 - $64.  For reservation call the Ordway Music Theater at
224-4222.<p>

A wonderful Swedish home from 1868 Mrs. Annie Johnson actually lived in
the house until 1972.  On the property is an immigrants house, transported from
Bone Lake in the North East corner of Scandia.  This is the kind of very simple
one room home with sleeping loft that would have been lived in by very early
immigrant workers.  It was transported to this site from Bone Lake where a
farmer actually used it to store grain.  The Scandia Historical Society have
restored it to it's original condition.<p>
Perhaps the most spectacular building on the grounds is the Swedish Church, a
simple one room building built in 1930's.  Subsequently, the building was used
as a schoolhouse.  It was taken apart many times for moving and alteration.  If
you look closely, you can see how the original wood planks were labeled for
reassembly.   Each year, the Church is still used for weddings and a
traditional Santa Lucia celebration.<p>

You have probably driven by this house many times and wondered what was hidden
inside.  The house first owned by General Riley Bartholomew and built in the
early 1850's has been restored by the Richfield Historical Society.  This

the 1890s.  You can tour the Atwater House, a gothic revival home built in the
Andrew Jackson Downing style in the 1860's, a one room Schoolhouse, built of
Shakopee Red Brick in 1887, and the Chaska Depot, built in 1886, which had two
waiting rooms, one for men and one for women.  <p>

The Kelly Farm was built in 1849 and is an actual historic working farm.  After
you park your car and visit the modern museum building, you walk a dirt road
past natural prairie into the 1870s. Visitors can actually participate in the
farm chores of harvesting and planting with historically accurate tools and
equipment like oxen and horses.  The horses are actually being bred back to a
similar Morgan breed, accurate to the era.  The Kelly Farm belonged to Oliver
Kelly who was an innovative farmer and entrepreneur.  Oliver Kelly is
responsible for founding the Grange, the first successful national organization
of farmers.  The Kelly farm is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society.
It is a stunningly beautiful place.<p>

restored buildings within the Fort transports you quickly back to the early
1800s. The characters recreated at the Fort are even more interesting.  Not

This beautiful house was built by Governor Ramsey in 1872.  He and his
descendants lived there until 1964, when the last of the family died.   The
house was a lively place, known for its elegant politics and parties.  A trip

<h3>
AND NOW ABOUT YOUR PHOTOS...<br>
by Peg Meier</h3></table>

If you enjoy old black and white photographs, I have a few suggestion for you about the photos you take the way you store them.
<p>
Most people assume that their color snapshots and portraits will survive in family albums, shoe boxes and picture frames just as well as the old black-and-white photos did.  Wrong! If you live another 30 or 40 years, you're likely to outlive your color photos.  
<p>
<img src=images/snowangel.jpg height=288 width=227 align=right>So it would be smart for you to shoot some black-and-white film.  If processed correctly, it lasts 200 or 300 years.  Heat, light and humidity-the chief enemies of photos-harm black and white negatives and pictures far less than they do color.  All color film and prints fade.  Color prints, slides, Polaroids and videos all slowly disappear to nothingness.  Some color images show marked deterioration in only 10 years.  Most color photos last fewer than 50 years.
<p>
Take a look at your color prints and slides from he 1950s.  Have they turned blue or yellow?  Then you'll probably get my point.  Unless you take precautions to preserve your color photos-precautions that few of us amateurs bother with-the images are likely to be gone in a few generations.
<p>
You make be thinking, "That's silly! Nobody will want to see my snapshots in 50 years." (I can read minds.) My rebuttal: look around your house.  Aren't some of your favorite possessions the old family photos?  Probably some of the black-and-white are from long-gone generations.  Just as you love to see those faces, study their features and guess how they lived, your descendants might someday like to have photos of you.
<p>
It's important to take at least a few black-and white photos on special occasions, such as births, religious celebrations, weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and family reunions.
<p>
But as the everyday photos in this book show, black-and-white photography can be wonderful to document the "ordinary" times that sometimes are sublime.  I'd suggest you load your camera with a roll of black-and-white to photograph the baby in her bathtub, the little leaguer at bat, your new car, colleagues at work, pets and other 'everyday" photo opportunities.
<p>
Some professional photographers will shoot black-and-white portraits and wedding photos, even though demand, unfortunately, has declined dramatically.  I know several couples who recently had both black-and-white and color pictures taken and much to their surprise, prefer the black-and-white.  They're glad they sought out photographers who were familiar with black-and-white work.
<p>
Heat and humidity rapidly age photos.  The worst place to store old photographs is in he basement (too damp) or attic (too hot).  Fireplace mantels and walls with heat sources nearby also are poor choices.  What's optimal is a cool, dry, dark place.  A closet shelf in an air-conditioned, first floor from may be best.  Keep the negative there too.  Black and white negatives last even better than prints, so put them in a safe place too.
<p>
Because people tend to display their best photos, we actually single out our favorites for destruction; sunlight and fluorescent light fade photos noticeably in only 10-15 years.  Display color photos only if they are expendable or if you have a copy in dark storage.  Have duplicates made of special slides and use the duplicates for projecting; the light wears them out.
<p>
Do yourself and your family another favor-label your photos.  Even a few notes with names, dates, locations and occasions are appreciated when memories fade.  Write on back of the photos-never the front- with a soft pencil.  Ball-point pens leave indentations; felt tip pens smear.  Special pencils for writing on photos are available in photo shops for a small price.  
<p>
Don't take apart photo albums, not even stranger's albums that were bought for a song at estate sales.  Albums reveal a great deal more about the person or family than individual  photos do.
<p>
Don't try to repair a damaged photo yourself.  Soaking curled pictures or taping ripped ones promises disaster.  Paper clips rust and ruin photos.  Tape grows yellow and crispy, staining the photos.  If you absolutely insist on taping photos, at least work from the back.
<p>
Select a photo album that will protect your photos, not ruin them as many albums do.  Most inexpensive albums wreck pictures.  Beware of"magnetic" photo albums, the kind that work by gripping photos on sticky cardboard with plastic overlays.  This kind of album causes rapid fading and discoloration.  Look for albums that have plastic enclosures of archival quality; the packaging will say that.  But he best method is probably the one our grandmothers used:Corner mounts in a scrip book.  The glue touches only the page, not the print.
<p>
All the evidence isn't in yet for videotape, but its useful life may be as short as 15 years or as long as 50.  It is known that videos start to deteriorate after 50 playings.  Don't count on them as mementos for future generations.  Make a backup copy of a special tape, file the original and show the copy.  Then if it breaks or deteriorates, you can make another copy.  
<p>
If you want to shoot color pictures, use the most stable materials to begin with.  These would be Kodachrome slides and Cibachrome prints (which can be made only from slides).  Put the negatives for color snapshots in a sleeve so they won't get scratched.  A new print can be made from the negative after the old print starts to fade.  
<p>
If you have wonderful old photos, I hope you'll consider giving them or copies of them to an historical society.  Your county society might be interest in local scenes and people; the state society might want your most fascinating photos.
<p>
I'm sorry to be so preachy about preserving your photos.  But it is a tragedy that the billions of color photos taken every year will be goners.  Soon there will be a big gap in photo collections beginning in the 1950s and 1960s when black-and-white photography went out of favor.  There will be a lost era in photography-in our photo albums, historical societies, museums and in our culture.
<p>
You can take steps to be sure your family photos survive.

<blockquote>HTML editor's note:<br>
We all know photos may also be stored in digital formats, too, either by using a digital camera to take the picture or by scanning existing photos or making frame-grabs from video tape.  But a photo may not survive for tens or hundreds of years just because it has been digitized.  Images stored on a hard disk may be instantly lost due to hardware failure or a careless erasure.  Images stored off-line may become unreadable as new and improved, but non-compatible, hardware takes over.  If you don't believe that I have a box of 8" floppies I'll sell you.  For those who want to store their photos digitally should make multiple copies (and multiple backups) and be sure to copy archival materials to modern formats well before the old format disappears.</blockquote><hr>

<P><I>Wed. Nov. 22 - Kelly Farm</I></P>

<P>First day of shooting and we really needed warm clothes...the word sunny was misleading since the wind must have been a thousand miles an hour...we all have found the advantage of those toxic chemical hand warmers...We shot at the Oliver Kelly Farm, a historic location..realistic to 1870.  David Yanko played our farmer who in the first scene is leading an oxen pulled wagon (yep, real oxen named Berry and Bud) and then later building a coffin for his wife who died in childbirth....Other cheery scens included a surgery room in the bottom stalls of the barn circa Civil War...we enter the scene right after Sam Bloomer has lost his leg and James Patin playing the brother of Isaac Taylor who also died in Gettysburg.  Sounds like living in Minnesota in the 1800s meant a lot of dying.</P>
<P>Jim Kron, Joe Price and Rich Brown made it look truly beautiful...the barn cats helped in the coffin making scene and John LIghtfoot, Nate Herzog, James Patin and Jill Jacobson can tell you lots of stories about battling the cows and the wind all in great style!  Ask Jill about being pregnant, while you're at it...All in all a very good day one...we'll keep you posted.</P>
<a name=nov23></a>
<P><I>Thurs. Nov. 23 - Kelly Farm</I></P>

<P>Back out at Kelly Farm this time doing mostly the slices of life of Harriet Nichols (played elegantly by Jill Jacobson).  We began the day by recording the grunts and squeals of the pigs (named, Ham, bacon and sausage).  Jill actually got into the pigpen and fed the little (200 lb.) darlings...One piglet tried to eat Jim Kron's jacket as he was kneeling in pig dung shooting the high 8.  Next stop was the hen house....the chickens were very noisy much to our delight...We tried to fill the henhouse with fog but the fogger popped out on us....so we were saved the ultimate experiement...does roscoe fog juice kill chickens....Kron kept talking about the canaries in the mines.   Then some spectacular stuff in the kitchen as Jill made a vegetable stew, a la 1855.  The highlight here was the Kroncrane....a short crane move accomplished by Jim Kron standing up and then sitting down (we told you our budget was small)....</P>
<P>One of the great glories of the day, however was a Dr. Dave Markegard invention...a flicker control....Working on the soundwaves off of an AM radio talkshow, the lights flickered randomly and when jelled amber....looked like a fireplace..a candle..a giant kerosene lantern.   imagine the golden flickering flames as we move through Sam Bloomers room  lingering  on his turn of the century artifical leg.   Yeah, well a fun time was had by all.  Monday is Ramsey House...the rich folks side of the story.</P>

<a name=nov27></a>
<P><I>Monday, Nov27 - Ramsey House</I></P>

<P>Today...Governor Ramsey's big old mansion.  Did you know that hte family (actually 2 spinister sisters)lived in the place until 1963.  Then all members of the family were gone.  There areno living relatives of Governor Ramsey today.  But, we had Walter Ritter as Governor Pillsbury (he looked just like the picture in his moustache and beard and black suit) reading letters about the grasshopper plague from his constituents and contemplating how to ease their sufering.  Type casting huh?  Actually when Walter sat down dressed in his other role, an uncle of Sam Bloomer writing during the Civil War...he mentioned that 1863 was probably when Human Resources began the process of rewritting the employee manual.. Patty Hegman helped us out by playing the elegant Mrs. Longyear...In 1918 receiving letters from her son during WW 1.  She did a superb job of reading and rocking...though we had to direct her to be less young and more matronly...All in all a good day inside a beautiful house with beautiful irreplaceable priceless artifacts that we couldn't touch unless you had one of the regulation sets of white gloves from Jean the mistress of the artifacts (and only Jim Kron got a set...mmmmmmmm).  Tommorrow a simple day battling at the History center to shoot stills and then Wednesday we go off to Scandia to set up a "day of prayer and fasting" in an old church (Governor Pillsbury's solution to the grasshopper plague...he didn't want to "strip the poor of their moral fiber by giving them handouts"...) and Melody Gilbert's daughter as Louise, the little girl with typhoid...sounds like living in Minnesota was tricky...</P>

<a name=nov29></a>
<P><I>Wed. Nov. 29 - Gammelgarden</I></P>

<P>Today we were in Scandia....a lovely Swedish location Gammelgarden (that's with one of those little marks over the a in garden)...The church was built in 1854....and then used for years as a school house...taken apart and put back together and now restored to it's original rustic glory.  They have a beautiful Santa Lucia day service everyyear...this year is Dec. 9 or 10.</P>

<P>So we continue our study of the effects of Roscoe fog on all of us....out latest was the effect in a freezing cold wooden 1854 church filled with us and senior citizens playing Swedish parishoners (actually filled is a poetic exaggeration...it was 6 senior citizens recruited from the senior center across the street to put on costumes and shawls over their heads and recite the Lords Prayer and sing a song in Swedish.  The man playing the preacher (because Joe Price couldn't fit into the seminarian outfit) is a wonderful 86 year old man....His wife was a parishoner.....no one died from the Roscoe fog or the cold and their faces were so beautiful....candles, fog, swedish prayers, below zero temperatures.....</P>

<P>We also met the daughter of the woman who owns the city newspapter the county messanger while we were laughing and talking at lunch.  We invited her over to see the shooting and then when she walked in decided she would fit in one of the costumes so gave her the "great angle" on the story....to actually be one of the participants (i.e. freeze, wear an 1870 dress and sing a song in Swedish (now that wasn't my idea!!).  She took pictures of all the Scandians and sang well and then hurried off to write her story.</P>

<P>Other parishoners suffering in the cold and Roscoe fog included Leslie Kelison and Nate Herzog...their Swedish got better and better...</P>

<P>Melody Gilbert's sweet  5 yr. old child Jenna played Louise the daughter of Harriet Nichols (that's Jill Jacobson's alter ego) with Typhoid.  She was wonderful after the inital necessary giggle and delighted the crew with her ability to not crack up during the shooting.....she also has one of her front teeth very loose...just about to come out and go under the pillow for the tooth fairy.....that wonderful, tip it with your tongue loose tooth feeling....hard to remember but....</P>

<P>Again today,John Lightfoot, Joe Price, Lisa Johnson and Jim "I am my camera" Kron were creative and inventive and great fun to be with.....Some more stills tomorrow and then Monday, Dec. 4...Murphy's Landing.... brrr it's cold in Minnesota and I didn't wear warm enough clothes.......</P>

<a name=dec4></a>
<P><I>Mon. Dec. 4 - Murphy's Landing</I></P>

<P>Today, out at Murphy's Landing to do grasshoppers and other adventures.  As you recall from earlier updates, southwest Minnesota was invaded by locust (that's super grasshoppers) from 1873-1876 and it devastated the area.  Today we actually shot our grasshoppers...these grasshoppers are expensive little bugs...4 live ones and one that died on us for $50....and we got them from a guy that works at the MN. zoo and breeds bugs for fun...he has something like 200 different kinds of bugs in cages at home (most of us try to not have bugs in our homes in any way but this guy is different.)..So we set up scenes for the starring grasshoppers, coming out of a bag of cornmeal,  crawling over a letter, walking in the pantry over the only food left (potatoes)....well the thing with bugs of course is when it's cold, they sort of slow way down.....like waaaaaay down...So the starring monsters of terror were motionless as they hit the cold window sill of the cold historic house...then you add Roscoe fog...well you can picture the scene.....we'll fix it in post.  We did have some big bugs in formeldahyde or alcohol...well dead already...from Carolina Biological supplies (these are the ones you disect in highschool)...if you need a little memory jolt for those old days of biology class, ask John Lightfoot to give you one...we've got plenty to go around.</P>

<P>A couple of real successes however....John  Lightfoot as young farmer was almost upstaged by the horse Buddy who ate carrots while reading the letter over his shoulder.  A sheep got a crush on Joe Price and followed him around while shooting at the farm.... and Nate Herzog, James Patin, Stephanie Mosher and Joe Price tried to capture chickens...(did not succeed in the attempt since the chickens can fly a bit)...And Lisa Johnson was quite at home as horse wrangler and friend to Buddy.  </P>

<P>Then Stephanie Mosher played a Civil War era woman wrapping up eggs, butter, bread and milk for James Patin, civil war soldier...and Norbert Een was absolutely hysterical as the bored Railroad depot attendant who kept spinning his pocket watch in boredom as the roof leaks in front of him.....Good work done by all....Jim Kron, Joe Price, Lisa Johnson, John Lightfoot, Nate Herzog, James Patin, Stephanie Mosher, Norbert Een, Buddy the horse, and Joe's new friend, the sheep.....next shoot December 11.....more soon...</P>

<a name=dec11></a>
<P><I>Mon. Dec.11 - Murphy's Landing</I></P>

<P>Even people slow down when it's 32 degress below zero windchill and you are working in historic buildings heated by woodstoves.  Vern Norwood our intrepid newspaper editor, almost froze his toes, literally (when he said "I can't feel my feet" we started to worry--I've heard of what happened in those north pole explorer diaries!!!) Finally 3 pair of wool socks and a couple of those toxic hand warmers and he thawed enough to chomp on a cigar and grumble appropriately while reading the Shakopee Auger circa 1850.  He also looked like a pro putting together letters to set up the type print...of course, who knows what he was spelling.</P>

<P>Tom Cushman brought liacs to Rita Beatty as two 1850s Lutheran missionaries.  Tom played Mr. Laugherty who travels up river to meet and marry.  Rita played Miss Smith, the woman set up for him...Miss Smith falls immediately for this handsome (if stuffy...) pious gentleman, Mr. Laugherty is not so sure about Miss Smith.  As Lisa Johnson said, "who wouldn't fall in love immediately upon looking at Rita..Tom is going to have to do some real work at acting!"  They end up engaged and married within a week...so much for courship in the 1800s in Minnesota.  Tom and Rita looked like they had stepped right out of 1853...amazing.  We told them we had some great material for a NewsNight Rollout!</P>

<P>The big scene of the day included 7 children (including Miles Norwood and two of Jim Kron's nephews ) in a one room school house (with only a wood stove for heat...we should be GRATEFUL for Minnegasco bills)being taught by Father Guido himself...Dan Thomas.  Dan was terrific walking the aisles holding a hickory switch and tappin on the boys slates and books...The boys were good bad kids..took a little coaching to get them to let loose and be true ruffians...but all took the challenge with great zest once we got started.  The boys favorite part was wehn we pullout Mr. Fluffy, the bullfrog.  (Names by John LIghtfoot after a friend's pet alligator...hopefully now deceased).  Mr. Fluffy, performed nobeley until his body temperature and therefore metabolism started matching that of the air in the school house.  However, like the grasshoppers...Mr. Fluffy seemes to have survived and John Lightfoot has grown quite attached to him..he eats one mouse a week...Mr. Fluffy that is, not Mr. Lightfoot....oh, send get well cards and good wishes to Joe PRice-bad cold in the bad cold- a true trooper (it's his Marinine training!)...and finally today we did some audio...real audio that Lisa could record.  Mr. Kron was his ususal chippaer and creataive self, even at 6:00 a.m. in the morning...so, more shooting on Wednesday...Fort Snelling to get that soldier thang..and a firecircle for the fur trader...we are all learning to BRING WARM CLOTHES..(otherwise you are miserable here in Minnesota...)more updates soon....</P>

<a name=dec13></a>
<P><I>Wed. Dec. 13 - Fort Snelling</I></P>

<P>Today we were at Fort Snelling. In the  morning we were turning Tom Shaw, their history expert, into Nathan Jarvis, MD. Jarvis was a doctor at Fort Snelling in 1833 and wrote home graphic descriptions of the life at the Fort.  Most surgeons thought going to fort snelling was like going to serve in hell.  Jarvis made the best of it and writes a letter home telling his sister about how his horse dies and they drag it outside the front gates for the wolves to eat...then as sport send their dogs after the wolves....And you thought you knew how to have fun!</P>

<P>So once we made it through the snow drifts and got the alarms turned off and climbed over the imbedded restraining posts and plexiglass protectors, we were ready to make our mark on history (or historical objects that is).  The highlight of that scene was when Jim Kron was moving something from under Jarvis' bed and actually discovered Jarvis' dog...yes, with a shriek, Mr. Kron announced that there was a dead dog under the bed.  When we looked, it was proved to be truth...indeed there was a dead, stuffed dog....a real dog...stuffed and looking to all the world like it was asleep or dead and stuffed.  We were able to fit it into the scene...how could we resist?</P>

<P>Next scene involved the hospital infirmary and 4 hardy civil war soldiers and a nurse made it through the snow to enact the hospital after the battle of gettysburg.  Unfortunately that was June and this room had a broken furnace...so indeed they were hardy souls...enduring endless takes of moaning and groaning and looking and sounding like they were going to die all in 20 degrees Minnesota December weather.  The great star was our intern Albert Lee (on loan from Newton's Apple) who agreed to take off his sock and let his foot get painted up to look gangreneous...and lie in bed for the shot...toes exposed...a great contribution.  We tried Lisa's foot since she had a toe crushed by a horse recently and we thought it would look gross but it looked too good so Albert won the civil war foot contest.  </P>

<P>upon the conclusion of these adventures, we walked outside to try and set up for the exterior shots to find ourselves pelted by stinging freezing rain and the camera beginning to be coated with a layer of ice....needless to say, the evening got canceled and we'll try to reschedule.  I am actually thinking we should shoot it in Cancun but that's another show concept all together!   Tommorrow, Landmark center and a 1920s Hibbing Dance hall!</P>

<a name=dec14></a>
<P><I>Thurs, Dec. 14 - Landmark Center / Sokol Hall</I></P>

<P>Today was the first day in many weeks of beautiful weather, bright sunshine, warm temperatures, blue skies....and of course, we were scheduled to work all day INSIDE.....such is the road of fate known as production....</P>

<P>so we were INSIDE at the Landmark center for the first half of the day.  Tim Brady played Alexander Christy, a minnesotan man raised on a farm who goes to Washington D.C. to work as a mathematician in 1883 for the Governor....and writes home to his brother on the farm how awful the urban life is.  Tim is a natural and played the frustration and longing to the exact level.  We sat him in one of the beautiful rooms in Landmark center, doing math equations with pencil and paper and crumbling up the mistakes....it seems he has had much rehearsal crumbling up papers....</P>

<P>Next was Steve Spencer as a depression era construction worker trying to get a job and walking down the hallways, climbing the stairs, coming out of rooms rejected...He was also wonderful...and frustrated, depressed and still carrying on....Steve at his best!  </P>

<P>The next scene was at the Czech hall-Sokol Hall on west seventh.  Now this would be a great place for a staff party!  we filled 50 helium balloons, crepe paper decorations, confetti on the floors and had four 1920s dancers doing the shimmy....Erika Herrmann was one of our lovely 20s gals and rounded up the others from the Dancers Studio...they were all dancing their hearts out in a dance hall in Hibbing where the shimmy and other cheek to cheek immoral dances were banned...festive to be sure...especially when the folks at the Czech hall pulled out the mirror ball for our use.  Of course we had to share the space with dances classes that were happening there and every so often stop for a rendition of Mack the Knife by Bobby Darrin being rehearsed in a swing step.  But that's part of sharing as John Lightfoot says.   Lisa actually got to do some audio again today (shuffling on the floor with the dancers) and Joe found ways to make the mirror ball shimmy itself.  Mr. Kron braved his safety in the middle of the dance floor for the shot and we had a successful day.</P>

<P>Tommorrow, landscapes and then Monday....loggers, a finnish miner, and the open out at Murphy's Landing...light a candle for good weather for us....</P>


<a name=dec18></a>
<P><I>mon, Dec. 18 - Murphy's Landing</I></P>

<P>Out at Murphy's Landing again on Monday.  But instead of it being 135 degrees below zero windchill like the last two Mondays (experienced by Vern Norwood, Tom Cushman, Rita Beatty, Stephanie Mosher, Dan Thomas and Mr. Fluffy the frog) it was downright balmy at 22 degrees above zero...Goodness, we could get spoiled this way.</P>

<P>We started the morning working with Mr. Jeff Weihe as a pissed off Finnish miner writing home about the 1907 strike on the Mesabi range.  Jeff looked great and acted even better, with tilts of his head as he thought about what he was writing, searching glances out the window.  All would have been perfect except for the fact that the letter takes place in August and it was December...so that meant everytime Jeff took a thoughtful sigh, a cloud of warm breath manifested itself.  We finally took togetting Jeff to hold his breath during the takes.  I must admit he was a great sport...I have never directed anyone when they can Breathe before...he can hold his breath and act at the same time........(a great feat..try it sometime)</P>

<P>Then Rosie the dog and 3 children dressed a loa 1850 farm go running in the pristine snow...of course the problem wit the snow right now is that it has an inch of thick ice coating ..not only is it gloss instead of mat but dogs chasing sticks so sliding...children running end up face down like a scene from the movie A Christmas Story...but the kids love it (and so did the dog).  The rooster that Rosie almost caught for lunch loved it too.</P>

<P>Next scene shot was the open...Jerry Lakso in a red union suit putting on warm clothes..cu of socks, cut of muffler, hat coat, mittens, boots...clomp, clomp clomp int he night through the snow, closeup of his hand and lanter, opening a wooden door latch.  Going to milk the cows?  feed the chickens?  The shot pulls wide as the door slams shut...it is an outhouse....</P>

<P>The highlight of the day shooting however was the next scene...the loggers and Horace Glenn.  Horace Glenn, a young man from St. Paul, goes up north to work at a logging camp to make some money.  While there, he writes home and describes the scent of Norwegians and Swedes and the state of affair with live...a very funny and somewhat nasty letter.  We had D.J. playing our cleancut young St. Paulite (destined to become a top lawyer) and the likes of Dick Lynn, Norbert Een, Rick Isenor, Bernie Beaudry, John Lightfoot, Jerry Lakso, Nate Herzog all playing the scratching, drinking, card-playing, joking Norwegian and Swedish loggers.  What an unruly team of players!!! all beared up and dressed in long johns, sitting in front of the fire, hooting at each other.  Give these guys a chance to be rough and tumble and they certainly rise to the occassion.  It was a ridiculous and lively scene...particularly when they started teasing Horace (D.J.)...Dick Lynn even played the fiddle (as him about his version of White Rabbit!) and Jerry Lakso turned out to show his ancestry...a dry Finnish sense of humor.  You all should have been there.</P>

<P>So another long, exhausting and good shooting day for BWC-special thanks to John Lightfoot, Erika Herrmann, Joe Price, Jim Kron, Nate Herzog, and new tot he team for the day, Shawn Walsh...chasing the challenge of audio...tommorrow more...FOrt Snelling, west seventh street and the Barthlomew house.</P>

<a name=dec20></a>
<P><I>Wed. Dec. 20 - Fort Snelling / Bartholmew House</I></P>

<P>Day ten went fast.  Started the morning at Fort Snelling.  Sunrise over the stone walls, reflecting off of the snow. Joe Price and God doing a pretty good lighting job.  Looked like a postcard but waweeee was it cold.  The wind whipping off the bluff down between the old stone buildings was vicious...everyone was blowing their nose alot. Not even bad SA coffee and donuts from Dunking Donuts helped.  Everyone had those red "healthy looking" windburned cheeks.  We dressed up a fort snelling fan (Keith) as Gustavus Otto, the private from Detroit who was in the army to avoid being in the jail.  His letter is whining about how cold and awful it is winter at Fort Snelling (wait a minute, wasn't I just doing that!!!) and begging his wife to get him out of the army.  He swears he is no longer a drunkard and is still not guilty of adultery.  We had Keith aka Gustavus Otto standing on guard in full 1840s regalia....he looked cold alright!  Then Jim Kron tromped through thigh high snow drifts to get those charming "detail" shots that a producer always wants....stacks of wood in the snow, ice crystals on old glass....freezing crew.  Lisa Johnson would try to get audio but continually grimaced....knowing that Fort Snelling is audiohell---on the freeway and the flightpath...She should have stayed in bed a few more hours....come to think of it, it was a bad audio day all around....the audio version of a bad hair day...she should have just stayed in bed period.!</P>

<P>After freezing our little you knows off, we traveled to west 7th street where Val Mondor played a grim police matron from Hibbing 1920 putting up posters warning people to not dance the shimmy.  She marched up and down that street in her sensible shoes hammering on all doorways.  She was great and grim and looked like she could easily be sitting outside ringing a bell for the salvation army....infact several people stopped and tried to give her money....</P>

<P>The final adventure of the day took us to the Bartholmew House in Richfield.  This is a great old farmhouse (on the historic registry) on Lyndale and 69th.  It is staffed by a terrific group of Richfieldites and worked beautifully for Linda Benitt,(in our world known as Esther Robinson) listening to the beginning of World War 2 while candling eggs (Ask her or John Lightfoot what candling is if you don't know...it could win you points at the next trivial pursuits game).  With old glasses and her hair braided, Ms. Robinson looked strikingly like Linda Benitt, a wonderfully literate writer of letters about life on the farm at the end of the depression.  Well, we were left with several dozen eggs at the end of the day and some beautiful footage.  Tommorrow is our last location day of shooting and then on to the trials of dark little Avid rooms.</P>

<a name=dec21></a>
<P><I>Thurs. Dec. 21 - Bakken Library / Fort Snelling State Park / Crosby Farm Park</I></P>

<P>last day of location shooting for Bring Warm Clothes.  We started the day putting a beard and moustache on intern extraordinare, Nate Herzog for him to play George Nelson, fur trader.  Nate has probably made the most cameo appearances in BWC.  When he is a big star and being interviewed by an ageing Letterman we are sure they will pull out the old scenes.  "Remember Scandia", Letterman will chirp.  "Oh, my" Nate will reminice.  "that was cold".   I think that is what all of us will remember...even through an Alzheimers haze....That was cold.  However I have become very attached to those little chemical hand warmers.  I've been thinking of sending a case of them to Laurie and Dan in Russia.</P>

<P>So with snow shoes attached we treked up a hill at Fort Snelling state park to have Nate stumble...I mean ...glide through the pristine snow.  Lisa put two wireless mikes on Nate in a desperate attempt to get some audio...any audio....!  Joe Price worked again with the Big One and tried to coax the sun from behind the clouds for the "cathedral" look of shadows and trees.  The sun stubbornly stayed behind the clouds until we finished shooting the various angles and were ready to move to the next location.  AND then it showed up...so what did we do...yep, you would-be producers guessed it.  WE DID IT ALL AGAIN!!!!  and it was truly beautiful...(yeah, sure , it was just fine without the sun and the shadows and who is going to notice anyway???!!!!)  Perhaps though the most wonderful moment was when a bald eagle appeared and began circling above us.  We dropped everything (including the lense) and shot it's graceful swirl in the sky.  It was close enough for us to see it's white head...so beautiful and as it flew away, a small feather floated down over us and landed in the creek.  We started the first day of shooting at Kelly Farm with the arrival of an eagle.  We thought this to be a very good sign on our last day too.</P>

<P>Next scene...at Bakken library.  This lovely mansion is on Zenith and 35th and dear deceased Mr. Bakken invented the pace maker.  So he donated his house and his money (we suppose) to create a library that is focused on the study of "electricity in life"...now this is not your turn the switch household variety of electricity.  The library includes a cool exhibit of the Frankenstein story and it's various interpretations of life and technology.  The house is spectacular and I hear the gardens in the summer equally beautiful.  We took Ms. ALex Sivertson over to play the strong willed Sarah Christy who writes a letter to her father arguing that algebra is not a "masculine attainment" and that she will get an education come what may.  An 1862 feminist.  Alex was wonderful in her feathered hat and little glasses and somber navy blue frock.  and the house was a beautiful backdrop.</P>

<P>Dinner tonight was actually a sitdown event in a heated restaurant ...(a bit unusual for this motley crew)..we went to Saigon Uptown where Nate was introduced to his first spring roll (This show has been a true growth experience for him!).  And had a heated discussion amongst the crew about the opening of gifts on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.   I had no idea that there was such a controversy of custom in this culture....the staunch Eve folks included Jim Kron, Nate Herzog, Lisa Johnson and equally forcful were the morning openers John Lightfoot and Joe Price.  I must admit I am glad to be Jewish and not have to contend with this difficult decision.</P>

<P>After dinner, as the sky grew darker we drove to Crosby Farm Park and journeyed into the woods to build a fire for the old fur trader George Nelson to sit by and write in his journal.  Of course, we did wonder what kind of fool Nelson was to be stuck out in the woods in the snow in the dark all alone....but since we had little choice in the weather or the season in which we are producing this show, we made good use of our recently renewed artistic liscense.  And in the dark woods with a warm golden fire crackling and the still snow (except for the occasional helicopter noise)....it seemed like a great way to end a great shoot with a great group of folks.   (Jim Kron, Joe Price, Lisa Johnson, Nate Herzog, and John Lightfoot).  And a special thanks to all of you who helped by bringing the letters to life (see Bring Warm Clothes on the water cooler..day one through ten for reminders of all the great actors amongst us)...and to all of you reading these....thanks for your fond attention and  have a merry very merry holiday.....</P>

<h3>About Mr. Fluffy</h3></table>
<u></u><b></b><p>
<b>Mr. Fluffy was the bullfrog who starred in the lively schoolroom scene in <i>Bring Warm Clothes</i> which
illustrated the letter by the Missionary/School Teacher Daniel Fisher.  His gripping performance has made him something of a celebrity to the KTCA staff.  Now that the program has aired, we're sure that there are many more fans out there, like yourself, who'd like to get an update on our beloved little green friend.</b>

<b>Where is  Mr. Fluffy now: </b><p>
John Lightfoot, the associate producer of Bring Warm Clothes, has Mr.
Fluffy in a spacious 20 gallon aquarium (luxurious condo size for a frog).  He
has about 4 inches of room temperature water and lovely colored pebbles on the
bottom. he also has a big rock with a large hole in the middle for
entertainment.<p>
<p>
<b>How did he get his name:</b><p>
Mr. Fluffy is not a totally original name.  In fact, his namesake was an
alligator that lived in Minneapolis.  The original Mr. Fluffy got to be about 4
feet long and a bit too big for Mark's apartment tub.  So Mr. Fluffy #1 went to
live happily at Gatorworld in Kississimee Florida.  The present Mr. Fluffy will
probably not get much larger than 8 inches.  He will not have to go to Florida
and will continue to reside in the warm home of Mr. Lightfoot.<p>
 <p>

<b>What does Mr. Fluffy eat and how often:</b><p>
<b></b>Mr. Fluffy's favorite meal consists of live crickets.   He goes into a
state of frog happiness (observe his wide eyes and dialated pupils) and sits
rock still until the crickets get close.  Then zap...his tongue has zipped out
and gotten his tasty tibit.<p>
He eats about a bunch of crickets twice a week.<p>
<p>
<b>What makes Mr. Fluffy happy:</b><p>
<b></b>Warm water in his condo;<p>
lively crickets when he's hungry;<p>
anything else is hard to tell.<p>

<b>How do you know if a frog is a Mr. or Ms. Fluffy:</b><p>
We don't know...except he  rivets and we understand that to be a song to
impress a girl frog.<p>
<p>
<b>Interesting facts and photos of and about his relatives can be found at the <a href=http://www.cs.yale.edu//HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/loosemore-sandra/froggy.html>Froggy Page</a>.</b><p>

<center>HYPE History and Process</center>

<p>
Success = Youth Input.</font><br>
One of the key components to the success of the HYPE project is youth input in the early stages of development to ensure authenticity and a sense of ownership.  In early 1992, four focus groups were conducted with culturally, socially and economically diverse youth ages 14-19.  The groups represented participants in a leadership and career develop program, an alternative school, a juvenile corrections population and a community journalism program. These 'experts' expressed enormous enthusiasm about the show and stated the need for positive images of themselves in the media, more opportunities for involvement in constructive and innovative programs and exposure to career options.
<p>
<font size =+2>Recruitment</font><br>
In recruiting participants for the production phase of HYPE, staff worked with program providers, school advisors and advocates, but  most effectively connected with young people on their turf.  Professional and community mentors were also recruited to work with the participants and staff in HYPE production mini-crews which included design, promotions, special events & fund raising, production, writing, music video and topic research and talent coordination.
<p>

<font size =+2>...To reality</font> <br>
On September 23, 1992 about 100 youth, mentors and station staff convened in Twin Cities Public Television's Studio A for the first HYPE orientation/production meeting.  The agenda included, among general production and process items, a motivational expression from Mahmoud El-Kati, a noted historian, educator,  and community leader, who has embraced and nurtured the gifts of young people for over 30 years.  This mentor has been one of several committed adult participants throughout the entire process.

DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE: Who, Why, What?</center><br>


A Television Show</font><br>
The media plays an extraordinary role in shaping our perceptions and prejudices. Unfortunately, the images of youth of color one currently sees on television or reads in a newspaper is more likely to reinforce negative stereotypes than to broaden understanding. HYPE allows these young people to speak for themselves to a broad audience, bringing to light not only of  the problems they face, but the richness they have to offer the entire community.
<a href=hypeshows.html>The Shows.</a>
<p>
<font size = +2>
A Training Program</font><br>
 HYPE is introducing young people of color to a variety of job experiences within the television industry and working mentors in various fields in the community.  Through HYPE we are addressing the critical need for trained and qualified media professionals of color as well as promoting social responsibility.  All these elements puts Hype at the forefront of the current media literacy movement.  
<p>
<a name=selection></a>
<font size = +2>
Issue Selection</font><br>
One of the key components to the HYPE process has been youth involvement from the ground up.  They have been the experts that have helped  designed a project to address the need for positive images.  Young people determine the show topics, do the research, produce news stories, and select guests to appear with the Hype crew in studio discussions. 
<p>
<font size = +2>
Community</font><br>
Partnerships are critical to our ability to accomplish the objectives of HYPE.  We rely upon many community organizations to help identify program participants and highlight role models through the series and outreach efforts.  We promote organizations and programs working with youth on issues related to each show's topic.  
<p>
<font size = +2>
Believe the Success</font><br>
HYPE has been in existence since September, 1992.  Through out Hype's <a href=history.html>history,</a> we have gained much experience and insight.  What started out as a hip hop-based television show and training opportunity has grown into a social movement.  HYPE, the television and outreach process,  has become a vehicle for social change for youth of color that educates, enlightens, and empowers all people.

Twin Cities Public TV, KTCA/KTCI<br>
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS UNIT MISSION AND GOALS</font>
<p>
The Community Affairs Unit exists to provide a voice for communities of color, the poor and other marginalized communities who have little or no voice within the main stream of media. Our mission is to shatter stereotypes, bring a new awareness to the mainstream community and positively impact the self-image of underrepresented communities. We produce programs that enable these communities to speak directly to themselves in the 'language' they understand. On the surface these programs may appear to have a limited audience; in reality they have widespread appeal because they allow a general audience to 'listen in' on a dialog they don't have access to. 
<p>
The Community Affairs Unit exists to go beyond broadcast into an activist realm of motivating people to create self-determined change, and in so doing, redefining the role of a public television station in its local community. Our work process is empowering and enables people to speak for themselves and define the issues for themselves. 
<p>
The Community Affairs Unit exists to take risks, be a laboratory for experimentation, be a training ground for alternative voices, and most important of all - foster a new accountability to the communities we serve that goes beyond the traditional role of journalism.
<p>
We are not reinventing public television; we are taking it back to its original mission that emerged in the 1960's - to provide a means of access for alternative voices that were shut out in a pervasive climate of racism in broadcast media and the larger society.
<p>
<font size = +2>Goals</font>
<p>
In addition to a challenging mission, the Community Affairs Unit sets for itself ambitious goals.  Those in italics are recent additions.
<p>
<ul>
PRODUCTION

<li>Let people tell their own stories rather than analyzing and interpreting for them.
<li>Produce programs that enable underrepresented communities to speak directly to themselves.
<li>Create a process of production that empowers the communities or people involved.
<li>Bring people together on common ground to address common issues.
<li>Foster working relationships with independent producers.
<li>Be experimental in form, style and content.
<li>Continually create new models of production that are empowering and participatory for 'nonprofessionals.'
</ul>
<ul>
COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS
<li>Build new partnerships with community organizations and be a catalyst motivating new collaborations.
<li>Develop a standard and active process of accountability to the communities we serve.	
<li>Engage in community development projects.
<li>Make presentations to community, youth, civic, education and corporate organizations.
<li>Host community focus groups.
</ul><ul>
TRAINING and MENTORSHIP
<li>Create new employment, training and mentorship opportunities as part of how we go about developing and producing programs.
<li>Seek to constantly develop and expand the pool of local talent with whom we as a Unit, and the station as a whole, can work.
<li>Coordinate an expanded the HYPE Apprenticeship Program. 
</ul>

<h1><i>Invisible to the Eye</i><br> background information</h1>
<pre>
<h4>
KTCA-TV presents "Invisible to the Eye," produced and directed by Robert Byrd, 

who explores with great sensitivity and insight the world of Foua Kue, a teenage 

boy who was severely burned ten years ago.  The one-hour documentary will air 

on KTCA/Channel 2, Wednesday, April 10, 1996, at 8:00 PM, and will be repeated 

Sunday, April 14 at 10:00 PM.


In 1986, three-year-old Foua was burned in a house fire in South Minneapolis.  

Through some miracle, he lived.   But some of the medical people treating him 

thought he might have been better off dead.  After numerous medical procedures, 

Foua returned to his family and school. But he was different. His ears and nose 

were gone. So was much of his hair. He lost the fingers on his hands. His skin 

had changed color and ninety-five percent of his body was badly scarred due to 

skin grafting.  But his eyes were all right, and so were his brain and his heart.

Not everyone could adjust to this new horribly burned, disfigured Foua. His 

father, who had been separated from the family, refused to accept what had 

happened to his first-born son. To him, Foua was gone.  But to others, Foua was 

very much alive.


With great courage, intelligence, determination and humor, Foua set out to rejoin 

the world.  He did this with the help of his mother, therapists and his school 

teachers. "I read about Foua's case in the newspaper and I thought it just might 

make a good subject for a documentary film," Producer Robert Byrd recalled. He 

contacted the family and they allowed him into their lives. Byrd and his camera 

followed Foua from the family home to school, to a playground, to a dance, to a 

field trip, all depicting in various ways Foua's unswerving determination to live 

as normal a life as possible.


If he is hurt by the inevitable stares and comments of strangers, he may feel it 

but he will not show it. But he will show other emotions while doing activities 

typical of boys his age: coping with lessons in school, playing sports, and 

discovering girls. His classmates are the outside world in microcosm: some accept 

him readily and treat him as they do everyone else. Others are horrified by his 

appearance or even scared of him. Foua learns to deal with his situation and with 

life in general. Occasionally, he will pause and declare: "I don't know what my 

future is."


Robert Byrd says Foua is without qualification "the most courageous person I 

have ever met. I was visiting him once and I told him about all of the well-

known people I had worked with and asked him if he knew which one I admired 

most. When I told him it was him, he was very surprised." Yet, Foua does not 

think of himself as being courageous or special in any way, Byrd says. "Only 

when he hears it from others does he realize how he is meeting the incredible 

challenges of his life with dignity." In a very real way, says Byrd, Foua's 

story is our story. "It's about how we respond to those who are profoundly 

different from ourselves," Byrd says. "One doesn't have to be horribly 

disfigured as Foua was. It's the same with people whose skin color is different, 

whose sexuality is different, who are of a different gender, who speak 

differently. We're taught from a very young age to respect only the standards 

of beauty that are set for us by the media. We're taught to reject everyone else 

who is not on this media scale of beauty. Foua's burns throw him completely off 

the scale."


Those  who come in contact with Foua--or others like him--generally find that their 

lives have been significantly affected, Byrd believes. "To a great extent, Foua's 

life is shaped by the way people react to him," he says. "If they accept him, they 

will make his adjustment easier. If they recoil from him or avoid him, he knows it 

and his self-esteem suffers. "I really hope this film not only tells Foua's story of 

courage and determination but provokes people to think about their attitudes toward 

those who are different," Byrd says. "I want people to examine their capacity for 

tolerance and get themselves past their fears of people like Foua. In going through 

that process, they--we--may have to shed some of our traditional values and beliefs 

that tend to validate us by invalidating others. "Those who reject Foua--who, after 

all,  is just a child--show how capable we are of terrible, inexplicable prejudices 

toward those who are different from us.  Ultimately, because of the extremeness of 

his situation, Foua can help us as much as we can help him."

<h2>
Producer/Director Robert Byrd 
Reflects on <i>Invisible to the Eye</i>
</h2>
<h4>
"Invisible to the Eye," the latest film by Twin Cities Public Television filmmaker 

Robert Byrd, is, he believes, as good a film as he has made in his 10-year career 

and elicited the same emotional response from him as a film called "Torture: The 

Shadow of a Beast," a film he made in 1987 about people subjected to torture 

practices.


Dealing with highly sensitive subjects as torture and a burned child is not easy, 

Byrd acknowledges.  "I try my best to treat people who are subjects of my films 

in the most respectful way possible," Byrd says. "This is how I try to maintain 

their dignity.  This was an especially important consideration in making 

'Invisible' since the self-esteem of this boy rises and falls so easily based on 

what others think of him."


Byrd much prefers making films about people such as Foua than about "issues."  

While he acknowledges that topical documentaries are important and can be just as

interesting, "I prefer to concentrate on ordinary people and to try to tell their

stories as well as possible, and ultimately I always discover that there are many

hidden issues in their stories," he says.


"In making 'Invisible,' it became clear to me that I not only had to follow him 

around for some time but that I also had to find out what his family and his 

friends think of how and they relate to him," Byrd says.  "So much of his story

is told through their eyes.  And considering the we had only 25 days to shoot the

film, I believe we have captured some telling moments in Foua's life.  

Undoubtedly it could have been better -- they all could have been better -- but

on the whole I am pleased with it."


A resident of Minneapolis, Byrd earned a B.A. degree from the University of 

Chicago in 1975.  He has won numerous awards for his films which, like 

"Invisible," deal with a range of socially sensitive subjects such as race 

relations, sexual orientation, hate crimes and politics.


"Whatever my topic, I always learn from making a film," Byrd says.  The lesson

Byrd learned from "Invisible," he says, is that, "no matter how great my troubles

may seem to me at times, they are miniscule compared to Foua's challenges in life.

I believe that everyone, at one time or another, encounters what appears to be a 

truly insurmountable problem...one which you either overcome or are defeated by.

This is not to trivialize other people's challenges which, of course, are very 

real to them, but Foua's are of another magnitude altogether."


Looking ahead with great anticipation to his film's airing, Byrd advises the 

audience:  "Don't be afraid to look at the story of this burned but very 

courageous boy.  He has many valuable lessons to teach us all.  I think in the

end everyone who watches 'Invisible' will be glad they did."

<center> <b>MNTV RETURNS FOR A FIFTH AND <i>FINAL</i> SCHEDULED SEASON<br> WITH 15 HALF-HOUR SHOWS !<br><br></b></center>

Since it premiered in November 1990, MNTV (Minnesota Independent Film & Television) has showcased the work of local film and videomakers.  Every season has brought a wider audience to Minnesota's independents, making new fans of viewers and critics alike.<p>

The 37 pieces selected this year, chosen from more than one hundred entries, present an astounding range of styles and genres, including dreamlike, impressionistic video paintings as well as gritty documentaries.  This season also has a brand new graphic look, and features interviews with many of MNTV's writers, directors and producers-each telling behind-the-scenes stories about their innovative work.<p>

"In doing the interviews, I wanted to make the series as much about process as product-to create enthusiasm for not only watching but making films and videos," said Series Producer Andy Rothschild.  "Recently, there's been a lot of attention paid to the growing feature market here, and the Twin Cities now has an art film multiplex and a revival house.  But we shouldn't lose sight of the many, many projects that are being conceived and produced right here.  That's what  MNTV is all about."<p>

MNTV is produced in collaboration with Cable Access St. Paul, Independent Feature Project/North, Intermedia Arts, Minnesota Film Board, The Playwrights' Center, Screenwriters' Workshop, University Film Society, and Walker Art Center.<p>

As it exists now, the series costs about $50,000 to produce, money simply unavailable in the wake of recent significant budget cuts at Twin Cities Public Television.  "There is no funder in sight," laments KTCA Executive Producer Rick Hauser.  "The situation of course is complicated by the fact that we must find funds beyond those already supporting KTCA programs.  It must be an additional gift to the station."<p>

This season's 15 programs are each built around a theme-from Anxiety and Therapy, to Science/Fiction? and Americana. For show listings, check out

First Course<br> 
Show #1<br>
Airs Sunday, November 5 at 10:30 PM on KTCA/TV, Channel 2<br>
</b><br>
The series premiers with a show that embraces the wide range of MNTV submissions, pairing a highly polished, 24-minute dramatic narrative shot on film, with an in-camera edit exercise done for an introductory video class.  The program takes its title from the fact that it's the first show in the series; that it echoes the setting of "Salt Shaker"; and that both works represent first-time efforts by the film/videomakers ("Salt Shaker" marks Grund's directorial debut, while "Eye: Video I" is Bowen's first ever video).<br><br>

"Salt Shaker" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#grund">Andy Grund</a><br>
A dramatically stylized tale about the power and simplicity of death. Part film noir, part black comedy, the 24-minute film pairs The Afghan Whigs' Greg Dulli with Minneapolis actress Kathy Hendrickson, as a married couple attending a self-imposed last meal. Produced with the help of an all-volunteer cast and crew, it marks Grund's directing debut.<br><br>

"Eye: Video I" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#bowen">Penn Bowen</a><br>
To satisfy an assignment for his introductory video class, Bowen creates a delightfully paranoid chase scene featuring extreme close-ups of his facial features and hands. An absurd and hilarious short.<br><br>

"Helicopter" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#williams">Garret Williams</a><br>
A coming-of-age story about the relationship between Malik, a young basketball prodigy from South Central Los Angeles, and his friend Eugene, a.k.a. "Helicopter", who helps prepare Mailik for an upcoming tryout with the USC basketball team. Helicopter plans to follow his friend out of the ghetto all the way to the pros, but in the end, his dream of success falls tragically short. The film took First Prize at the Black American Cinema Society's 1993 Independent Filmmakers Competition.

</b>
Autobiographical films and videos made by women, each of whom explore personal and cultural issues relating to gender.<br><br>

"18 Years in the Making" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#spartz">Tara Spartz</a><br>
An upbeat and fast-paced montage of home movies, created by Spartz when she was 18 and a student at the Minnesota Center for Arts Education. Though the films were originally taken by her father, she transforms the footage, through voice-over, into a brief commentary on her own childhood memories.<br><br>

"Daddy" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#harper">Lynn Harper</a><br>
A young girl persistently seeks the attention of her fatherrepeating "Daddy" only to be ignored. An evocative, ominous piece featuring camera shots composed entirely from a child's-eye perspective.<br><br>

"Living in Half-Tones" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#ando">Me-K. Ando</a><br>
Through recently captured imagery, as well as simulated archival footage and text, Ando explores her experience of returning to Korea for the first time since her adoption in 1970, searching for bits and pieces of her past.<br><br>

"On all fours. Balanced." by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#ajohnson">Amy Johnson</a><br>
Using abstract visual motifs, Johnson relates the effect that a misogynisticyet popularfairy tale had on her as a child, and the profound way in which that story, and others like it, continue to influence the person she is today.<br><br>

"It's Outsides Turn with Us" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#seelinger">Geoff Seelinger</a><br>
A fascinating, autobiographical video composed in three distinct movements, each linking a present-day mundane event to a dramatic misunderstanding from Seelinger's past.

"Jammer from the Slammer" by  <a href="mntvproducer.html#poindexter">Ed Poindexter</a><br>
The culmination of a year of shooting, rescheduling, cancellations, and equipment failures, this surprising videoproduced in prisoncombines Poindexter's musical interests with the case facts of his 25 years of incarceration at Stillwater Correctional Facility.

<b>Ed Poindexter  <a href="mntvlisting.html#s13"><i>Jammer from the Slammer</i></a><br></b>
Ed Poindexter is a 50-year old prison inmate whos been incarcerated since 1970. He's a multi-faceted artist who's not only been involved in social/political rap music for over 5 years, but is a movie script writer, amateur audio engineer and musician. He wrote his first rap tune shortly before the Gulf War, entitled <i>This Program</i>, and his second, <i>War In The Gulf</i>, the evening that the U.S. bombed Baghdad. Poindexter feels fortunate to be serving his sentence in Minnesota, as opposed to other less progressive states, because as he puts it, "The administration has been very supportive of our musical endeavors. They not only built us a small 8-track recording studio, they've given us the time and resources with which to work in a quiet and comfortable environment, conducive to creativity."  <br><br>

<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<br>
<center><img src="stills/wacpowlog.jpg" ><br>
<h2>POWWOW: A Significant Gathering</h2></center> <br>

The Powwow is an American Indian gathering focusing on dance, song and family celebration.  Traditionally, it is a celebration presented by one tribe or band to welcome and honor others.  Powwows are usually three day weekend events and people may travel great distances to attend.  The main Powwow season is summer (traditionally beginning with a Powwow in March in Denver), however there has been a resurgence of Powwows in the last decade, making it possible to attend a Powwow every weekend year round in North America.   All people (including non-Indian people) are welcome at Powwows and are encouraged to attend one, as experiencing a Powwow can be  a valuable and fascinating cultural experience for non-Indian people unfamiliar with our neighbors, the Indian people.

<br><br>
There are several different kinds of Powwows, though the two most common are known as traditional and competition Powwows, respectively.  In traditional Powwows everyone who participates in the dance or singing programs is awarded day money.  While there is still a degree of competition in the dancing events, it is somewhat informal and ceremonies such as honorings, giveaways, "first" dances and adoptions are also important activities of the day.   A competition Powwow, on the other hand, has significant prize money available for the dancers, depending upon the resources available to the individual host tribe. While everyone can still compete and dance, only the dancers who place near the top of the competition receive prize money.  Drum groups also compete for prize money.
<br><br>
The Powwow is organized by the Powwow committee, a dedicated group of members of the host tribe.  Their work involves the bringing together of the drums, dancers, entertainment, food, crafts booths, and the administration of the Powwow grounds (parking, registration, camping, sanitation, sound system, and security).  Once the Powwow begins, it is run by the Master of Ceremonies (MC) and Arena Directors.  Different MCs have different styles and the choice of an MC greatly influences the feel of the Powwow.  The MCs provide a running commentary of events,  announcements, and most importantly background information about the dances, rituals and spirit of the Powwow.  Instilling appropriate humor into the proceedings is also the work of the MC.  The Arena Directors keep the event moving and manage the flow of activity in the arena.  At any one time, they may be telling the drums who will play next and what kind of song to have ready, seeing to the accommodations of the judges, or organizing the dancers. It is an extremely active and important job.  <br><br>

Judges are changed for each category and are chosen for their knowledge of the dance style and drum.  They judge dancers on their style and form, regalia and ability to stay in time with the drum and stop on the final beat.

Working in close collaboration with Native American scholars and tribal leaders, KTCA Senior Producer Barbara Wiener and the KTCA production team chronicled a major PowWow held in Minnesota in the summer of 1994, The Mdewankanton Dakota Community PowWow in Shakopee.  

Dakota anthropologist and member of the Dakota community, Barbara Feezor Stewart, clarified another aim of this project:  "This society is filled with inaccurate images of American Indians, and the images are easily manipulated. So being able to show some sort of pride in our culture and heritage at a PowWow is very important for the mental health of Indian people."  It is in that spirit that Wacipi - PowWow hopes to guide non-Indian people toward understanding and appreciation of varied aspects of Native American culture.

<h2>THE GRAND ENTRY</h2></center>

The Powwow begins with the Grand Entry.  All spectators are asked to rise as the flags and eagle staffs of the host and visiting tribes are brought in. The Eagle staffs and flags represent nations, families, and communities.  As the drums begin a grand entry song, the chief or tribal chair of the host tribe and visiting dignitaries enter the arena.   They are followed by other honored members and the color guard of veterans.   Elected royalty (princesses, warriors, etc.), young people who have been chosen and honored by their specific home community to represent that community at Powwows around the country, follow next. Led by the elders, the men dancers follow next, generally in the following order: men's traditional dancers, men's grass dancers and then men's fancy dancers.  Then the women enter, also led by the elder women and in the order of women's traditional dancers, jingle dress dancers and then fancy shawl dancers.  The teenage boys enter next, followed by the teenage girls and then the younger boys, girls and tiny tots.  The dancers in each category are announced by the MCs as they pass the announce stand.  Finally the arena is filled with all of the dancers, each dancing in their grand regalia. Responsibility for maintaining the song passes from drum to drum, going around the circle until all dancers are in the center of the circle and dancing.  With all remaining in the center of the circle,  the prayer song and honoring song for veterans begin next.  It is a spectacular sight filled with beauty and excitment and pride.

<center><h2>THE DRUM</h2></center>
<img src="stills/drum.jpg" align=left hspace=10>
People say you can't have a Powwow without a drum, for it carries the heartbeat of the Indian nation.  It is also felt to carry the heartbeat of Mother Earth, and thus calls the spirits and nations together.<br> <br>

The Powwow drum is a large base covered with hide (buffalo, deer, or cow).  Forming a circle, eight or more men strike the drum in unison with covered mallets.  The men then blend their voices with the beating of the Drum to create the song.  The songs are often in the Indian language of the drum members. It is the responsibility of the drum members and especially the lead singer to be able to sing and play whatever kind of song is requested  by the master of ceremonies or the arena director for any given event (i.e. flag raising, honoring ceremony, different kinds of dances). 
<br><br>
It is said that the drum was brought to the Indian people by a woman, and therefore there is a woman spirit that resides inside the drum.  Approriately, it is to be treated with respect and care, and strict behavior is expected of anyone coming in contact with the drum.  The drum is often thought to help bring the physical and mental side of a person back in touch with his or her spiritual or heart side. As with many things in the Indian culture, the drum is used to bring balance and rejuvenation to a person through their participation in dancing, singing or listening to the heartbeat.

<head><TITLE>PowWow: The Songs</TITLE></head>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>


<center><img src="stills/wacpowlog.jpg" ><br>
<h2>THE SONGS</h2></center>
The music in a Powwow comes primarily from the drum groups who circle the 
arena.  The drum groups usually consist of several men, each with a covered 
mallet, circling a large drum covered with hide (buffalo, elk, cow, etc.). The men 
then blend their voices with the beating of the drum to create the song.  The 
songs are varied and endless in number: some are traditional and passed down 
through history; others are contemporary and created to speak to current 
concerns and interests.  Many songs are sung in the original Indian languages,  
a fact some believe will help keep the languages alive and vital to the growing 
youth.  
<p><p>
Each category of dance has a specific style of song and pace that is appropriate 
for the specific dance.  The Drum group, particularly the lead singer, is 
responsible for having whatever style of song is required immediately available 
at the request of the MC or arena director.  
<p><p>
Songs are very important and have intense personal impact.  
<p>
Mike Hotaine, MC and Dakota person from Manitoba, explains. "There is a song 
everywhere.  No matter where you go, there is a song.  And that's what we're 
told to listen to.  There's songs in the grass, because it is the sacred blanket of 
Mother Earth in the summertime.  And there are songs in the wintertime when 
the wind howls through windows and doors, there is a song.  There's songs in 
birds that sing a particular song and there are words in that song.  All we have to 
do is learn to listen to them, the great songs of Mother Earth."
"God gave one of the greatest gifts to us, to sing together, and the beat of that 
particular song , the drumbeat itself, which is your heart.  So your heart is your 
drumbeat, and your songs are the gifts of life...the songs of life."
<p><p>
Ron Davis, a Grass Dancer from the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, says. "You hear 
a good song, you're out there dancing, you kind of go to your inner self, into 
where you had your vision.  You go back to the place where you feel 
comfortable in your own state of mind.  And nothing else around you can 
interrupt that.  And when you hear that song, it's so pretty, you know, it sounds 
like the wind.  And you just dance to that, and it feels good."
<p><p>
Lillian Goodeagle, a Dakota/Northern Cheyenne champion Fancy Shawl dancer 
, explains.  "A real good song, it just comes into you.  It's like in your heart, and 
your body, your feet, your legs, your arms--everything--is expressing that song."

<head><TITLE>PowWow: Regalia</TITLE></head>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>


<center><h2>THE REGALIA</h2></center>
<img src="stills/womregalia.jpg" align=left>The dance outfits worn in the circle during the Powwow are called regalia or outfits.  Though highly decorative, these outfits are never referred to as "costumes".  The term costume denotes artificiality and wear that is donned for an event that is not a part of one's ongoing life.  To the contrary, these Native American outfits are very personal and artistic expressions of the dancers' lives, feelings, interests, family and spiritual quest.  Often elements of the regalia are gifts from elders or treasured people in the dancers' lives and are honorings to be worn with pride and responsibility.  The regalia evolves and changes as the dancer evolves and changes in life.  Each season, changes are made depending on the fashion of the time or the personal change in taste.  There is no contradiction in blending historic elements with very modern elements, for example interweaving traditional beadwork with Minnie Mouse braid holders.  <br><br><br>

<img src="stills/manregalia.jpg" align=right>Since the regalia expresses the life of each individual dancer, design elements from many different sources are appropriate.  As Ron Davis, an Objibwe Grass Dancer, explains "It takes a long time to make an outfit, you know.  You can go through life and keep adding on to that outfit.  Because there are different circumstances that surround different items that you add to your outfit.  When you're dancing, these things that are in the regalia, they bring out a shine.  You actually shine out there, and you feel good about yourself.  Everybody can do that.  It's not just for Anishinabe people.  It's for everyone."

(Indian name: "Returns From Around the World")<br>
Mdewakanton Dakota<br>
July 7, 1943 - January 18, 1995
</h2></center>
<br>
KTCA wishes to honor the memory of Buddy Whipple, whose  insightful and often humorous remarks contributed much to the creation of this program.<br><br>

The son of an ordained Episcopal Minister, Buddy Whipple was born and spent his early years in Nebraska.  After serving a tour of duty in Vietnam with the U.S. Marine Corps, Buddy transitioned from soldier to accomplished dancer of the traditional style. He was a co-founder of the Three Rivers Dance Clan, a group that performed traditional dances at schools and other venues such as the Ordway Music Theatre, the Children's Theatre, the Walker Art Center.  The group also included members of his family.  Buddy served as a Powwow arena director and on the Board of Directors for Juel Fairbanks Chemical Dependency Services in St. Paul.<br><br>

He lived in Minnesota for the last 25 years.  Buddy is survived by two children and three grandchildren.

<font size=5>O</font size=5>n the day after Christmas 1862, the United States hanged 38 Dakota men in Mankato, Minnesota and drove a people out of the state.  The heroic story of their brave struggle to survive is told by the Dakota themselves in <b>DAKOTA EXILE</b> - a sequel to the critically acclaimed KTCA documentary, THE DAKOTA CONFLICT.

<p>

<font size=5>T</font size=5>he 1862 hangings represented the largest mass execution in U.S. history and marked the end of the Dakota Conflict - what non-Indians called "The Sioux Uprising" - as well as the beginning of a long journey into exile for the Eastern Dakota Nation.  Narrated by rock-and-roll legend <a href="bio.htm">Robbie Robertson</a>, <b>DAKOTA EXILE</b> traces the paths of Dakota prisoners and refugees.  Through the words of Dakota Elders and tribal historians, <b>DAKOTA EXILE</b> tells of the struggle to remain Dakota in the face of government efforts to destroy their language and culture.

<p>

<font size=5>"W</font size=5>e didn't have a reservation any more.  They threw it open for the whiteman," recounts Alvina Alberts, whose grandfather fled Minnesota as a four-year

old boy.  "We were oppressed people. But we can say that we have survived."

<p><a href="images/prison.gif"><img src="images/tnprison.gif" align=left height=137 width=225></a>

<font size=5>I</font size=5>n the aftermath of the Dakota Conflict, more than 6,000 Dakota survived by escaping westward, while more than 1,700 were imprisoned at Fort Snelling. The prisoners were eventually transported by steamship and railroad boxcar to the Crow Creek Reservation in the Dakotah Territory, where many died from exposure and starvation.  The free Dakota were left scattered across the plains, as their lands were confiscated by the federal government and sold to benefit the white victims of the conflict.  To this day, the Dakota have received little or no compensation for their lands.<br clear=all>

<p>

<a href="images/calbefo.gif"><img src="images/tncalbef.gif" align=right height=131 width=225></a>

<font size=5>B</font size=5>ut more than land was taken.  "The plan was for the government to say, 'Look, let's take the language away,' so they'll lose their spirit," explains Mike

Hotaine of the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation, Manitoba, recounting how Dakota children were forced to attend schools run by whites.  There, Native American students were forbidden to speak their own language.

<br clear=all>

<p>

<a href="images/confirm.gif"><img src="images/tncnfirm.gif" height=134 width=225 align=left></a>

<font size=5>D</font size=5>akota spiritual beliefs were also targeted for extermination, as white missionaries sought and obtained conversions to Christianity, making bonfires

of sacred medicine bundles.  By the 1880s, the federal government had banned traditional native religious observances and dances.  But they were continued in secret.  "I remember my mother said when she was little, they would have a PowWow or 'Wacipi', and cover up all the windows with blankets, so no light could go out," recalls Darlene Renville Pipeboy.  "That's the only way they could have it." <br clear=all>

<p>

<font size=5>I</font size=5>t was not until 1934 that the Bureau of Indian Affairs finally recognized that the eradication of native languages was not necessary for the education

of Native American children, and the official suppression of native culture, language and ceremonies was abandoned.  But much damage already had been done.  Traditional Native American religious practices were not protected by law until 1978.

<p>

<font size=5>"M</font size=5>ore than any single event in our state's history, the Dakota Conflict defined racial relations between Native American and non-Indian peoples in Minnesota," says <b>DAKOTA EXILE</b> producer <a href="bio.htm">Kristian Berg</a>.  "Once the Dakota were exiled, Minnesotans heard little of their fate.  This is the first time a television documentary has gathered and presented stories of Dakota people and their disparate paths after the war."

<p>

<b>DAKOTA EXILE</b> is a KTCA production.  Producer/writer: <a href="bio.htm">Kristian Berg</a>; Additional Writing: <a href="bio.htm">Darren Renville</a>; Director of Photography: Robert Hutchings; Associate Producer: Steve Spencer.

<a name=alive></a><font size="+1"><b>
<A HREF="../alive/index.html">ALIVE TV</A></b></font><p>
Twelve seasons of the best...er, boldest...independent films on the planet.<p> 	



<B>Untitled/Bill T Jones</B><br>
Untitled, directed John Sanborn and Mary Perillo, is tribute by Bill T. Jones to his long-time partner, Arnie Zane, who died of AIDS.  Jones includes Zane's voice on recordings, animates still images of him dancing, then recreates some of Zane's unique steps. <p>

<B>Relatives</B><br>
Dancer Ishmael Houston-Jones's performance/essay on the family and one's ambivalence toward it.  In one segment, Houston-Jones dances while his mother, Pauline Jones, delivers an improvised monologue. (directed by Julie Dash)<p>



<B>House of Tres/It Doesn't Wait</B><br>
House of Tres celebrates the underground/pop phenomenon, "house" dancing, an expressive form born in New York City neighborhoods.  It Doesn't Wait, draws on the look and rhythms of popular dance forms.  With the streets of NYC as their stage, dancers emerge and disappear while cars, pedestrians and passerby who happen along the street become part of the work. 
<p>



<B>Words in Your Face</B><br>
A cross-section of the new "spoken-word" movement in a collection of short works that are explicit, political, fresh, funny, dangerous, and unpredictable. Words in Your Face features 20 writers, poets, rappers, playwrights and others who rant, chant, and whisper their messages in an explosion of language and image. Featured performers include rocker poet Henry Rollins, Obie-winning performer John Leguizamo, rap artist KRS-1, and a host of writers.
<p>
<B>Dinizulu & Contenders</B><br>
Dinizulu and His African Dancers, Drummers and Singers, founded in 1947, is one of the first African-American cultural performance 
groups and the oldest still currently in existence. The company  is dedicated to keeping traditional dance and music alive, as well as exposing  and disseminating contemporary ethnic performance. <p>

Choreographer Susan Marshall's Contenders, directed by Mark Obenhaus, is a physical dance work with a sports motif filmed in a New York gymnasium. With music by noted experimental composer Pauline Oliveros.<p>

<B>Pull Your Head To The Moon</B><BR>
A film by David Rousseve and Ayoka Chenzira that centers on text and movement by Rousseve.  The artists trace the experiences of mortal loss between Rousseve's current New York life and his Creole grandmother growing up in Louisiana during the 1920's.  <p>

<b>Reckin' Shop:  Live from Brooklyn</b><br>
An intimate portrait of the mecca of hiphop, the original dance crew, the true rude boy underground.  You don't get more underground than this sublime dancing from a thriving subculture...the real ones.  Directed by Diane Martel.<p>


<B>Slowly This</B><br>
When two friends meet for drinks in a crowded Manhattan restaurant, something takes place that is virtually unseen in American media: a Japanese American man and an African American man engaged in intimate conversation about their lives.  Provocative, personal stories that overturn stereotypes of how men of color relate to each other. Director Arthur Jafa's award-winning work as a cinematographer includes Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust, Spike Lee's Crooklyn, and past ALIVE presentations Relatives and Praise House. <p>


<B>Praise House</B><br>
An acclaimed dramatic dance-theater work  adapted for television (described by one critic as "a poignant gospel-jazz-blues service") by the performing ensemble Urban Bush Women and director Julie Dash (Illusions, Daughters of the Dust). Praise House describes the path to unity of earth and spirit via the revelatory experiences of a young African woman in the American south, reborn to herself after angels encourage her to express her latent talent for painting. A counterpoint is the life and the death of her grandmother, whose journey to heaven is a majestic passage through the pearly gates. <p>		

<B>Red Book</B><br>
Janie Geiser's short film that uses painted puppet figures in two-and three dimensional painted sets to explore the point of view of a woman who has lost her memory.  The woman's amnesia is so complete that at first her mind offers only fragments of images.  Without her memory, she has lost her access to language, and so begins to invent it in the form of colorful, strangely fascinating pictographs.
<p>
<B>Best of Alive Compilation: Untitles and Contenders</B><br>
Untitled by John Sanborn and Mary Perillo, is a tribute by choreographer Bill T. Jones to his long-time partner, Arnie Zane, who died from AIDS.    Choreographer Susan Marshall's Contenders,  directed by Mark Obenhaus, is a physical dance work with a sports motif filmed in a New York gymnasium.  With music by noted experimental composer Pauline Oliveros.

TAPES ROLLING!</b></font><p>


The series that takes us along on a day or two in the lives of some ordinary Minnesotans, and reveals some extraordinary aspects of what they do.<p>

<B>Echo Bodine: Ghostbuster</B><br>
As a young lady Echo Bodine decided she'd had just a few too many clairvoyant encounters for comfort.  This scared her at first; but as time passed she realised that there exists a great demand for her specials abilities.<p> 

<B>Farmer's Market</B><br>
From farm field to market stall, we follow a typical family as they bring their produce to the beloved weekend farmer's market.  A centuries old tradition, yet still a "fresh" change from the supermarket aisle ways.<p> 

<B>Helping Paws</B><br>
Some very bright canine companions make like a whole lot easier for some mentally spirited, but physically challenged Minnesotans.<p>

<B>St Paul Saints</B><br>
An affectionate tribute to 	the resurgence of enthusiasm for baseball the way it was meant to be played...under the stars.  Affection aside, there's fun to be had at a St.Paul Saints game, and the team's charismatic President, Bill Veeck, guarantees it.<p>

<br>



As a bonus to stereo reception most television sets can now provide a second audio program channel. This is in addition to the left/right stereo signals and is a separate audio source.
<p>
Use of the sap channel can range from a duplication of what is on the main audio channels, a second language, descriptive information on the program, or material totally unrelated to what is being viewed. It is not uncommon to find that all of the these types of material are sent at one time or another during the broadcast day.
<p>
Television sets generally require the SAP channel be specifically selected to hear it. The method of selection is outlined in your owner's manual. If you can't find it, give the store you purchased it from a call. Most salespersons can help talk you through the set's selection process. Generally the SAP is either a mechanical switch labeled "stereo-mono-sap" or a menu accessed programing function that allows the same functions to be addressed.
<p>
KTCA has pioneered the introduction of SAP to the Twin Cities area. Barely a day goes by without a viewer calling requesting information about "that strange audio" on our signal. While normally we transmit a copy of the main audio channel, at times we don't. I would encourage you to become familiar with your set's operation before SAP causes interruption to your viewing enjoyment. Once you've gotten the hang of switching back and forth, tune in, at times it is more than entertainment.  Soon you'll be saying "what in the world are they doing now ?".

<h1>SPONTANEOUS HEALING WITH ANDREW WEIL, M.D.
</h1>
<strong><p>Tuesday, December 10, 7:30 PM on Channel 2
<br>(R -- Saturday, December 14, 12:10 PM)</p>
</strong>
<IMG SRC="Weilcover.gif" HSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=215 HEIGHT=234>
<p>In SPONTANEOUS HEALING, Andrew Weil, M.D., a best selling author and one of the most celebrated leaders in the field of health, healing and "integrative medicine," delivers an impassioned lecture before a live audience in the elegant and intimate setting of a Spanish mansion.</p>
<p>Weil's premise -- the concept of "spontaneous healing" -- is that all living things have the ability to self-diagnose, to identify areas of injury and illness, and to heal themselves -- if given a chance. Drawing on fascinating case histories from his own practice as well as medical techniques he has observed around the world, he tells how "spontaneous healing" has worked to resolve life-threatening diseases, severe trauma and chronic pain.</p>
<p>In Weil's view, traditional Western medicine places a "lopsided emphasis on disease," and, especially when practiced at hospital is designed mainly to handle crises. He compares this with Chinese and herbal medicine -- natural therapies which are most effective for preventative care and non-life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p>"The focus of my work at the University of Arizona," Dr. Weil says, "is to try to teach doctors and patients how to integrate these two worlds... to make use of all available range of therapies, especially natural therapies. And I think this idea of what I call integrative medicine is really the future."</p>

<h1>WISHBONE
</h1>
<strong><p>Weekdays at 3:30 PM and 5 PM on Channel 2</p>
</strong>
<IMG SRC="Wishbone.gif" HSPACE=6 BORDER=1 ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=170>
<p>With his uncanny knowledge of Shakespeare, Dickens and Chekov, Wishbone -- a little dog with a big imagination -- is the children's show that has won a faithful following among adults everywhere, from college students to senior citizens. Designed primarily for children ages 6 to 11, this half-hour, live-action series stars Wishbone, an endearing Jack Russell terrier, who serves as a canine bridge between contemporary life and classic literature. </p>
<p>In each episode, the escapades of Wishbone the dog help introduce a different literary classic. Some of his adventures include sailing a raging sea as Odysseus in a scene from Homer's The Odyssey, sniffing out clues as Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles and falling head-over-paws in love in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>With a regular cast that includes his 12-year-old owner and other neighborhood friends, Wishbone also has "real-life" adventures in story lines that parallel the themes of the literary work featured in each episode. These modern-day sequences reinforce the timeless themes found throughout the classic tales.</p>
<p>"Wishbone the dog represents the imaginative, playful child inside all of us," said Rick Duffield, creator and executive producer of WISHBONE. "Through his wild adventures and heroic stunts, kids are introduced to some of the greatest masterpieces of world literature."</p>

<p>It began modestly enough: as a seven-minute act for a televised European song contest. A few months later, the performers were invited to present their act at the prestigious Royal Variety Performance, with Britain's Prince Charles in attendance. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the prospect of a full-scale expansion of the exhilarating, innovative music and dance was too tantalizing to resist and <i>Riverdance: The Show,</i> a two-act extravaganza, was born.</p>
<p>This feast of Irish dance and music created a sensation at its premiere in Dublin early in 1995. A few months later, it took London by storm. London's <i>The Guardian</i> called it "a pure adrenaline rush of movement that lifts formation stepping on to a heart-stopping plane," while <i>The Financial Times</i> proclaimed the performance "thrilling" and "intoxicating."</p>
<p>The show has just opened a month-long engagement at New York's Radio City Music Hall, and will be touring selected American cities. "This celebration will steal your heart away," said the <i>New York Post's</i> Clive Barnes. "New York has never witnessed an Irish dance show, with great music and singing, which has a character all its own and a vigor that just makes you want to get up and dance with them." </p>

<strong><p>Sunday, December 8, 7 PM on Channel 2<p>
</strong></center>
<p>With their growing fame, musical talent and personal charisma, sopranos Kathleen Cassello, Kallen Esperian and Cynthia Lawrence have individually conquered the most prestigious opera houses in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Now, they unite for a captivating, sold-out performance recorded at the Century Plaza Towers in Los Angeles this past September. The concert's repertoire, designed to unite these three exceptional voices, emphasizes sparkling and musically challenging trio harmonies that reflect the singers' remarkable ranges of tone, texture and emotion. </p>
<p>The sopranos' joint repertoire includes a unique medley of operatic arias arranged for trio, including exuberant highlights from <i>La Boheme, Faust and Carmen</i>. A resounding operetta medley includes highlights from <i>Die Fledermaus, The Merry Widow, The Mikado</i> and <i>Naughty Mam'etta</i>. And their show-stopping Broadway medley runs the musical gamut from<i> West Side Story</i> to <i>The King and I, Carousel, The Sound of Music</i> and <i>Kismet.</i></p>
<p>Throughout the concert, the sopranos -- gorgeously bejeweled and gowned in spectacular designer originals -- brings the concert crowd to its feet for several standing ovations.</p>

Slowly, This is a strong look at cultural identity in the 90's.
When two friends meet for drinks in a crowded Manhattan restaurant, something takes
 place that is virtually unseen in American media: a Japanese American man and an 
 African American man engaged in intimate conversation about their lives. The two men,
  writers David Mura and Alexs Pate, tell provocative, personal stories that overturn
   stereotypes of how men of color relate to each other.  Wrapped in a stunning visual
    tapestry created by director Arthur Jafa, Mura and Pate quietly unravel their 
    secrets for survival in a white world, and provide new insight into the state of
     race relations in the U.S.

<h2><u>SETTLEMENT-early 1800s</u></h2></center></table>
<hr>
<b><i>
At age 16, <b>George Nelson</b> left Montreal to become a clerk in the XY company fur
trading company.  For a time he lived with an American Indian
family and kept a diary of his experiences. As an young man in his twenties, he
writes of what he learned about the land and its Native people.<p>
<p>
</b></i>

Many a time in walking I have thought: Whenever this country becomes settled
how delightfully will the inhabitants pass their time.  There is no place
perhaps on this globe where nature has displayed &amp; diversified land &amp;
water as here. I always felt as if invited to settle down &amp; admire the
beautiful views with a sort of joyful thankfulness for having been led to
them.<p>
<p>
We had two Indian widows to pass the winter by us in a wretched hut.  They had
two daughters &amp; two boys,  I surprised to remark the boys frequently with
black faces, upon inquiring, I found they were fasting.  They sometimes dreamed
of their departed friends, and on those occasions, when they awake in the
morning, they bruise soft charcoal in their hands, with which  they rub their
faces so as not to leave one spot of the natural color, take their guns or bow
&amp; arrows &amp; go into the woods a hunting, and to mourn &amp; weep where
they may not be seen nor heard." They return at even &amp; eat after sunset!
The woman would frequently go out to the foot of the hill some distance off,
&amp; weep &amp; mourn &amp; moan, addressing her departed husband &amp;
friends in accents &amp; a tone of voice not to be misunderstood even by me,
young, thoughtless &amp; boisterous as I was.<p>
<p>
What is this ? Is it Barbarism? if so, what signify the "Irish wakes"? or our
own wailings on the departure of those dear to us? After a few months, &amp;
not infrequently only some days, &amp; we return to the busy occupations of
life, &amp; finally become quite reconciled &amp; oblivious--yet here, children
after several years, go into the woods &amp; bewail their departed friends in
quiet &amp; solitude, fasting the whole day.   All on their return, they would
generally be cheerful, as if it had not been them who but a moment before were
making such wailing, or, as if they had just been pouring off all their grief!
I have very often witnessed such scenes and they have left an indelible
impression.<p>

<h2>FORT SNELLING, 
established 1819</h2></center></table>
<h4>
Built upon a cliff overlooking the mighty Mississippi River, Fort Snelling was
for decades quite literally the edge of the frontier.  Never the scenes of
battles, it acted primarily as a government outpost for regulating trade with
the Indians.  In fact, the fort was established primarily because the U.S.
wanted to prevent the Indians from trading their furs to the British.  With
about 300 soldiers, officers and dependents, Fort Snelling was the center of
white civilization, providing a strategically inviting location for early
settlers to experience Minnesota and her charms.   
<p>
<a href="../livhistory.html#snelling">Visit Fort Snelling...</a><p>
<p>
It was often cold and lonely out on the frontier, as the letters of two early
inhabitants of Fort Snelling convey.<p>
</4>
<hr>
<b><i>Nathan Jarvis,</b> was a surgeon at Fort Snelling from 1833-1836.   In 1833,
he wrote the following letter to his sister:</i></b><p>
<p>
Dear Mary,<p>
I was much gratified in receiving your letter which by the by is only the
second one I have received since my departure from home, a period of nearly 7
months, and as our express starts tomorrow I embrace the opportunity of
answering it and the inquiries you make....<p>
<p>
As to news, little can occur in this distant region, secluded from the world.
We pass our time something in the way of exiles, banished from the pleasures
and I am add follies of civilized life.  Still there are charms even in savage
life and the wilderness.<p>
<p>
I have one of the best rooms in the garrison, the hospital range being built of
stone.  But what is of more importance in this climate and such winters as we
have here, is that we received this summer between 30 &amp; 40 large stoves for
the use of the garrison.  The winter generally sets in the beginning of
November, when everything remains in thick ribbed ice until nearly the middle
of April.  What think you of the thermometer being as low as 30 degrees below
zero?  Such is the case every winter in this climate. 2000 cords of wood are
generally consumed during the winter at the post.<p>
<p>
My horse took it into his head to die the other day and there goes $50 out of
my pocket and what is worse has left me horseless.  I had him drawn under the
walls of the Fort for a purpose that you will consider a very ungrateful return
for all his services to me--as wolf bait which soon attracted their
notices---<p>
	 "And nightly on my poor chevel<p>
	They made a glorious carnival."<p>
We however had some sport in chasing them with dogs....The soldiers amuse
themselves by having Balls in the Fort twice a week. <p>
<p>
Mary, all I want now is a wife can you pick out one.  As for me I never shall
have a chance of regular courtship for I have to stay here a long time and must
therefore like royal personages court by proxy!  Therefore select one for me
and describe to me her qualities and accomplishments and etc.  The mail is
closing and I must therefore close my letter by asking you to give my love to
all the family &amp; friends.  <p>
<p>
Yours affectionately<p>
N.S. Jarvis<p>

<b><i>Gustavus Otto  served as an army private at Fort Snelling in1849.  As
was often the case, the army was a haven for fugitives from the law, and this
may have been Gustavus' story.  He writes to his wife, requesting she get him
released from the service.<p></i></b>

Fort Snelling 7th April 1849<p>
Iowa Territory<p>
<p>
Dear Louise,<p>
Although I intended several times to write you, circumstances, labors and
feelings did not allow me to do this.  As I come today from my watch duty, I
have  time to do this...<p>
<p>
The winters are very cold here, particularly this one; we are in thick stone
buildings and had, each 2 men 3 woolen blankets and haystacks and yet we had to
make a fire in the midst of the night in order not to freeze.  I myself had my
face and ears frozen but I am cured again.  I have not been sick until this
winter when I caught a severe cold and had to pass several days at the
hospital.  I am better of it and would feel entirely well again, but the daily
thought, the dreams and restlessness, which I have almost every night, for my
poor children...<p>
<p>
Since two months, 3 soldiers have already been released by their Sgt., also
today one got free again, he is from Baltimore.  You could also do it if you
wanted to do it.  And my request to you is to do it.  I will not return to you,
if you do not want it, for you live perhaps happier without me, which I wish
from all my heart, but I am no drunkard anymore and I have learned to work and
if I was free, I could anyhow do some thing for my poor children, and save, in
order to enjoy my old age, if I should reach this.  But my hands are tied and 5
years of my life are gone, without helping my children at all. <p>
<p>
I beg you once more from all my heart do for me what you can, God will reward
you.  I am still innocent of adultery as I was before, although the temptations
for it are strong enough here.  Do you not wish to have me free again, write as
soon as possible, as I want to go to California then, to establish a new home
there--and let me learn to forget my dear poor children.  Be sure to have them
educated orderly, that they may not become so unhappy as their forsaken,
unhappy father.  Tell them a heartfelt farewell, greet and kiss them from me.
God Grant you altogether health and happiness and well wishes.<p>
from your<p>
lonely Gustavus Otto<p>
Company. E 6th Infantry Regiment<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>Otto did not stay long in Minnesota.  By the next summer he had deserted
the army and fled to California.</i></b><p>

<h2>WOULD BE MISSIONARIES -- the 1850s</h2</center></table>
<h4>
As the settlements extended west so did the missionaries.  Certainly, with all
that adventure to be had in the wild frontier, somebody had to keep all the
proper settler folk acting properly.  Sprung from the ever expanding Catholic
and Lutheran dioceses of the north eastern states came the carriers of the
Lord's message.   
<p>Be it Chosen One or otherwise, the day to day rigors of
frontier were shared by all, as conveyed in the letters of two would be
missionaries.</h4>
<p><hr>
<b><i>Daniel Fisher was a disgruntled seminarian from New York who
thought he would go west and "tame the savages."  He ended up teaching unruly
Irish Catholic boys in a one room schoolhouse in St. Paul.  He sends a letter
to a friend in 1852.<p></i></b>

Dear Friend,<p>
One soon gets sick of so much monotony and although the first few miles were
pleasant enough, yet I should have rejoiced afterwards to see anything as high
above the ground as a dunghill.  But such rich soil it is--and so deep-- New
Yorkers never dream of so much fertility...<p>
<p>
St. Paul is a large town, when the boat arrived, there were a thousand persons
collected on the shore although it was nearly 10 o'clock at night.  The
Catholics are very poor here--and what is worse very irreligious and
indifferent--they are Half breeds, Canadians and Irish.  The Yankees have all
the influence, the wealth and the power, although they are not near as numerous
as the others.  There are three papers published weekly here---there are six
churches and any number of doctors and lawyers and parsons--but there is no
money--as all the wealth is controlled by a Fur Company who owns nearly all the
shops and employ a great number of workmen and never circulate any money.  Oh,
they loan it at 60 percent!!  They pay their men in provisions--but I cannot
say much about the place as I have been in it only a month.<p>

What am I doing do you think? I am teaching the catholic School- my mission is
among the dirty little ragged Canadian and Irish boys.  Every day, morning and
afternoon, I practice patience with these wild little fellows-trying to teach
them who God is, and then to instruct them in the mysteries of.  I left to go
among the Indians and I was hoping for strength to undergo the hardships of a
savage life, or to meet a martyr's death.  I felt the difficulty of the
sacrifice more than anybody thought-- but the greatest trial was one that I
never dreamed of--and to take the charge of these impudent and insulting
children of unthankful parents was the greatest mortification I ever underwent.
But it was a momentary feeling of pride which prompted these thoughts--I told
the Bishop that I would undertake the school and having reflected that if this
were so great a mortification it would be more acceptable to God, I went into
the little low unplastered school room with so much love for my office as if I
were Vicar General of New York.  Whenever I get time, and my head cease to
ache, I study Theology--the Bishop told me the other day that he would ordain
me in September; but whether he will ordain me priest or only subdeacon I do
not know...It is well for those who thought of coming here that they did not
come--I think they would have been only disappointed in everything--the only
thing that can sustain a New Yorker in this wild country is the hope of a
speedy release form this life and a good place in the next.<p>

<b><i>Harriet Nichols arrived in the lovely town of Belle Prairie, Morrison
County in  1852, just three years after it had been settled.  She ventured West
to mission and eventually married a farmer by the name of William Harris
Fletcher.   Her story is chronicled in several letters sent to her
borther.</i></b><p>

Bell Prairie, June 9, 1852<p>
<p>
My dear Brother Henry,<p>
<p>
I suppose you are interested in courtship and marriage, and anything of that
nature so closely connected with your far off sister may not be uninteresting
to you...Now, when the canoe came down for us a fortnight ago, Mr. Laferty, a
young man who went up there as a missionary last summer accompanied the
boatsman for the purpose of obtaining a wife in Bell Prairie.  The missionaries
there had advised him to get Miss Smith, as she had been in the territory so
long, and they were acquainted with her.  She also heard of him before, and to
confess the truth, was desirous of obtaining his hand.  When he came, he was a
little disappointed in her, or rather was better pleased with the rest of us
than he expected.  We have all four of us been here for some weeks, and he
remarked to Mrs. Ayer, the wife of the chief missionary, that she had got a
fine lot of girls.<p>
<p>
Now don't you think we were placed in a rather delicate circumstance?  I don't
like this way of doing up the business.  He was so anxious to please the
missionaries that he had not independence enough to act for himself.  Why, I
should judge from his appearance that he was a worthy gentleman, and would
probably have made any of us a good husband.   You would have thought had you
been here that we had a curious time, and I assure you we did.   There was
enough romance acted here to write as good a story as you will find in any
novel. <p>
<p>
In one week from the time Mr. L. first arrived here they were engaged, on the
next morning married and in an hour afterwards he left in the canoe with the
goods, and she proceeded with he company eight days later.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i>Harriet married William Harriet Fletcher in 1853.</i><p>
<p>
1853<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Dear Brother Harry,<p>
I am glad you are so well pleased with your new home, as I am with mine.  We
all form one family and get along nicely.  I have quite a little family to take
care of, several pigs and eighteen chickens which have got so they fly  on to
my shoulders almost every time I go out.  And then I am kept quite busy mending
husbands stockings and mittens.  And I go with him sometimes to draw water from
the creek.  He says I must tell you to come up and see us, he don't feel like
writing to strangers.<p>
All my love,<p>
Harriet<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
January 17, 1855<p>
<p>
We have recently taken two Indian boys (one ten and the other four years of
age: their names are George Jay and James Bailey.. to bring them up until they
are twenty one.  It is a week today since we took them and they've have done
well so far.  The oldest boy seems to like work and is very kind to the little
one.  He takes most of the care of him.  Their father wants them to be brought
up like white children.  The youngest is partly white, has light hair and is an
interesting child.  Love to Nancy and the children.<p>
Yours with much affection,<p>
Harriet S. Fletcher<p>
 <p>
<p>
<p>
Wednesday, Jan. 31. <p>
 <p>
A little stranger arrived here last Thursday about four P.M.  They all that
have seen you say he resembles you.  I was taken sick about five in the
morning, and on the whole had a comfortable time.  I was obliged however to lie
ten hours afterward, before all was over.  We sent for Dr. Lewis, and he
succeeded well in removing the difficulty.  I have been gaining rapidly ever
since.  We call the baby "Charles Benjamin".  Our sister-in-law, Mrs. Jane
Fletcher, is with me.  Let us hear from you soon.  The little things you sent
look sweetly on the baby.<p>
Yours<p>
H.S.F.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
October 1858<p>
<p>
We are all well excepting Louise.  She's now sick with a Fever.  I think it's
the Typhoid.  The same that Uncle M had a few weeks ago.  I think I never saw
fever run so high as hers does, her face is scarlet, and her flesh is burning
hot,  I gave her five ice packs yesterday, and washed her about fifteen time in
cold water before I could inhibit the fever heat in the least.  Today she is
better--her fever does not rage as it  did yesterday.  I bathe her once in half
an hour and succeed in subduing the heat to a great extend.  I think by
tomorrow I will conquer it entirely, and in a few days she will be as well as
ever--This was the mode of my doctoring my dear husband with the dysentery and
fever.  We employ no physicians.  After he began to get better I was taken down
quite sick with the dysentery brought upon me by being over him night and day;
the day that I was taken sick one of the physicians of the place, he saw me,
said I was very sick, and should probably have a long sickness; he gave me of
his own free will and free of charge, some powders. The physicians do not have
good success at all, their patients run along seven or eight weeks and then
die.  So I laid his powders on the shelf and doctored myself.  By the blessing
of the Lord I was able to attend the Convention in three days with my Husband,
&amp; children.  We had a delightful time.<p>
With much affection,<p>
Harriet<p>

<h2>THE CIVIL WAR - 1861 to
1864</h2></center></table>
<h4>
Minnesota had only been a state for three years when the Civil War broke out in
the spring of 1861.  Govenor Ramsey happened to be in Washington on April 13 when
the news came that Fort Sumter had surrendered.  The next moring he volunteered
1,000 Minnesota men for the Union Army and a patriotic populace was eager to
oblige.  Minnesota men were involved in some of the worst battles of the
conflict, including Antietam, the site of what is now considered to be the
single most bloody day of the War Between the States. At Gettysburg a Minnesota
regiment was sacrificed to buy time for the Union forces.  In all, about 25,000
Minnesota men (mostly volunteers) fought and 2,500 died. <p>
</h4>
<hr>

<b><i>Issac Taylor was a soldier in the First Minnesota Volunteers unit.  The
following passages from his diary were written in 1863 during his days at
Gettysburg.  His brother writes the last entry, telling of how Issac died in
battle and where he is buried.</i></b> <p>

June 30<p>
Light showers and sunshine alternate.  Mustered for pay in a.m. In P.M. I go
"out round" to farm houses and get bread, butter, milk and eggs and etc.  A
good Union lady gives me a quart of apple butter.  We live on the "top shelf"
today, the boys are re enthusiastic in their admiration of Maryland generally
and at the nice bread and nice girls in particular.  General Hancock issues an
order complimenting us for our "vigorous exertions" in marching "full thirty
miles" yesterday and saying that such a march was required by the Major General
commanding on account of "urgent necessity".  <p>
<p>
July 1.<p>
The news that Gen. Meade has superseded Gen. Hooker is confirmed.  I shall hope
for the best but I don't like the idea of changing commanders on the eve of
battle.  Just after passing through (Harneytown), a citizen tells us we are in
PA.  At Taneytown, we hear there has been fighting at Gettysburg today.  At
8:45 P.M. we halt within a few miles of Gettysburg.  Build a barricade of fence
rails.  The full moon occasionally appears from behind the clouds.  Bivouac for
the night.<p>
<p>
July 4th, 1863<p>
The owner of this Diary was killed by a shell about sunset July 2nd 1863--his
face was toward the enemy. I, his brother, buried him 350 paces west of the
road which passes North and south by the houses of Jacob Hummelbaugh and John
Fisher, colored, at about equal distance form each and a mile south of
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  The following is inscribed on a board at his head.<p>
I.I. TAYLOR<p>
1st Minn. Vols.<p>
Buried at 10 o'clock A.M. July 3rd 1863<p>
by his brother <p>
Sgt... P.H. Taylor<p>
Co. "E" 1st Min. Vols.<p>
<p>
We buried him where he fell.<p>

<h2>A FARMER'S STORY</h2></center></table>
<html><head>

<hr><b><i>Edward Drew was a farmer in Winona.  His journal entries reveal 
the hardships of life on the prairie, and the occasional tragedies that were not uncommon.</i></b><p></b>

1868<p>

Thursday, March 5<p>
Haul one load of wood.  Bundy came and got me to go to Winona and get a load of
lumber for him.  <p>
<br>
Friday, 6 March.<p>
Haul 8 loads of fire wood to day.  Nicholas chops up trees and helps me load.<p>
<br>
Saturday, March 7<p>
I am compelled to chronicle here the saddest event of my life.  Nothing could
have happened to me that would have been more so.  My wife was taken sick about
midnight.  About 6 o'clock her child was born.  About 9 she died.  The poor
child is alive and well.  O what a day--what is this world to me now.  Were it
not for my poor helpless motherless children.  They must be taken care of.<p>
<br>
Sunday, March 8<p>
Lonely lonely day and dreary enough to me.<p>
<br>
Monday March 9.<p>
Following dear wife to her grave today.  Funeral appointed at 10:00 a.m. sermon
by the Rev. Mr. Dudley, Text Saint John 11: 3.  "Lord behold him whom thou
lovest is sick"<p>
<br>
Tuesday March 10.<p>
Spring birds are flying over this morning.  Froze quite hard in the morning but
soon begins to thaw very much.  Haul big load of corn to the yard and Nicholas
hauls it.  I overhaul the harness and shoulders again this second time.  Cut up
the meat.  Get the old meat out of the cellar.  Dreary time.<p>
<br>
Wednesday March 11<p>
Spring has come.  Hear the prairie chickens for the first time.<p>

<h2>THE GRASSHOPPER PLAGUE
-- 1873-1876</h2></center></table>
After the ravages of the civil war and the Dakota conflict, the people
of Minnesota were trying to put their lives back together when on June 12th,
1873 a swarm of Rocky Mountain Locust invaded the southwestern corner of the
state.  They ate everything in sight, including the blankets frantic farmers
used to cover their crops.  The following spring, eggs hatched and the young
hoppers were even hungier and more plentiful.  They swarmed into 23 counties.
Farmers told of the skies being so full of hoppers it looked like it was
snowing in July.  This continued for four years.  <b>Desperate farmers</b>
wrote to Governor Pillsbury for help.  <p>
<p>
Since Governor Pillsbury did not want to "ruin the moral fiber of the poor with
handouts", to fight the grasshopper plague, he declared April 26, 1877 as a
statewide day of fasting and prayer.  Four years after they arrived, the
grasshoppers flew out of the state.  By the middle of August, Minnesota was
free of them and the farmers harvested the biggest wheat crop the state had
ever known.  While some people insist that it was the governor's day of prayer
and fasting that succeeded in banishing the grasshopper, some say they just
went looking for  a new supply of food.<p>

<h2>IMMIGRATION and BOOM TIME -- late 1800s/early 1900s</h2>
</center></table>
<html><head><title></title></head><body>
<h4>
As the 19th Century came to a close, businesses in Minnesota were 
thriving, land was still plentiful and profitable for the taker and life, in general, was popping.  People arriving in St. Paul received job offers practically before leaving the train platform.<p>

Many of those new arrivals were European immigrants, particularly Norwegians, Finns and Swedes.  Some African Americans were also migrating north.   Like the American-born migrators from the East coast, all came to the state in search of personal prosperity.  What they often found were dangerous working conditions and low pay.<p>

Here are the stories of a few such newcomers to the state:
</h4><p><hr>
<b><i>James Christie was born in the industrial city of Dundee, Scotland in 1811.  He worked in the mills as a master spinner.  Dissatisfied with what he could provide for his wife and five children, he came to the United States in 1846 and eventually settled in Minnesota and went to experience the "American Dream."<p>

In 1847 James Christy wrote to his wife Eliza to explain why he wished to endure the hardships of the settlers life.</b></i><p>

Feb. 3,1847<p>
Dear Eliza,<p>
I have always told you that it was for the sake of our children that I would take upon me the toils of a settlers's life and if God spares them, how much easier it will be for me to die, knowing that they are independent.  We will each of us have 40 acres of good land and my 40 will still be there when I am gone.  Working in a mill, when you  die it is likely that you will leave a legacy of debt to your children and the same eternal round of slavery which has been your own lot.<p>

James <br><br>

<b><i>
James had five children: William, Thomas, Sarah, Alexander and David.  Alexander worked for a while in Washington as a mathematician for the Govenor.  He wrote his brother David back home in Minnesota on April 17, 1881.</b></i><p>

Dear David, <p>
Am I in favor of farming? My life here in Washington has made me realize the blessings of a piece of land , and independence.  I tell you I never appreciated, before coming East, and I know you can not appreciate  what Father and his brothers  did for us all when they brought us out of bondage into the Wilds of Wisconsin.  I tell you I see every day how the rich grind the poor, how men clothed with a little brief authority make their fellow men cringe and tremble for their bread.  Even here in America--what must it have been in Britain and in Ireland?  I am at war with my surrounding.  I may say nothing, but keep up a mighty thinking all the same.  If I am of the fortunate what few, who have little tyranny to bear, I am not at peace while the man at my elbow is under the iron heel.  I would never advise that your boys look forward to mingling in this mighty seething sea of struggling humanity.  Let us give them education and chance to see the world, but for Christsake give them land free from encumbrance and teach them how to keep it so and be contented.
Your brother,<br>
Alexander

<b><i>Sarah Christy, the only girl in the family, writes home from college to continue a lively debate with her father James about how algebra is not only for those of a "masculine" persuasion.</b></i><p>

My Dear father,<p>
Yours of the 15th came on Saturday night and now I sit down to answer it.  In the first place I am well and enjoying vacation to the best of my ability....
You think that I cannot come to college any more than this term.  Well if you cannot afford it I am agreeable to it-that I should come home.  Though it will be very hard for me to leave my Studies here and all the Friends whom I have become acquainted with.  But I know that you have spent more now on me coming here than you can well afford and a great deal more than I deserve.   <p>

I suppose that you will laugh at the Idea of me saving money to go to school with.  But I can tell you that I am determined on having an education and if I keep my health I will have one if it takes me ten years or more to earn money for it...I feel that the good which can be done with an education, not to speak of the pleasure which it gives to the possessor will more than pay for the expense, time and hard work expended in getting it.  Education gives power for good which money cannot give, and as God has given us these intellectual powers, it is our duty to cultivate them to their utmost extent and to use them for the means of doing the greatest good to our fellow creatures.  I think therefore that it is my duty as well as the duty of others to improve as much as possible and to cultivate my mind to be a Teacher to others.  It is my highest ambition in this world, and if I keep my strength and health, I am to have an education if I am thirty years of age before it is finished. <p>

You speak of Algebra as being a 'masculine attainment".  I cannot see as it is any more that than a "feminine attainment".  Now I cannot see how it is that men will think that they are any better fitted for the duties of life than women and that their powers are stronger.  They think that they are a little bit more elevated and look a everything from a higher place, and are , in fact a few inches taller.  But it is them who keep women where they are.   Now I believe that the weakness of women lies in their education.  They have the same powers given them that is given to man and if they were cultivated and strengthened, in the same way and direction, woman would be just as able to make her way through life as man is.  Let each have a fair trial and those who are not able for it, let them fall back to their old place.  It really  made me vexed when you said that Algebra was a "masculine attainment", like as if I could not learn it as well as any "masculine" I ever saw and maybe a good deal better than some, without killing me either. <p>

I have not time to  write more as I have to write to Sandy and Dave.  so I hope that this will find you all as usual.  Give my love to Mother and the boys and to all Friends...<p>
Your loving daughter,<br>
Sarah J. Christie

Smith Camp, March 10, 1901<p>

My Dear Parents,<br>

Today is my 22nd birthday but I feel like a kid of ten.  I have always enjoyed the best of health and spirits but never I believe in such a degree as lately.  My supply f animal spirits seems inexhaustible. I can work hard for 12 hours and feel as fresh as a daisy with the morning dew on it.  The perfect spring weather is partly responsible for it I suppose.  It is only evenings when I am forced to associate with these beasts they call Swedes that get depressed, but as soon as I get out in the morning I forget them, forget that I am lousy (have lice) and enjoy myself and nature.  I am the first man out in the morning because walking 2 or 3 miles behind a gathering of Swedes is something impossible to a person with a delicate nose.  The only smell which I have encountered which approaches it is the odor of a lot of Russians on a railroad hand car when well warmed up.  It is an odor which could only come from generations of unwashed ancestors and no man can hope to acquire it in one lifetime without the aid of heredity.  It also  reminds me of times when I have been out hunting and have come unexpectedly to the windward of a dead horse.  It gives he ravens the same idea for wherever there is a bunch of Swedes working there are always buzzards or ravens perched around the trees.<p>

My swamping partner is a Norwegian of a little better grade than the average and my precepts and practice have worked wonders with him.  I prevailed upon him to wash his feet after three months total abstinence from water.  He differs from the others in that he is not averse to adopting American customs and learning the language.  He has a great respect for me and he confided to me yesterday that when I first came he sized me up as a different and superior type from other Americans here.  Now he in the course of time will probably marry and encourage his children to adopt American ways and in the course of a few generations they may hope to eradicate that distasteful foreign odor and become good citizens and my humble influence will have had some affect.  I might formulate a proverb out of this that "there is more patriotism in teaching a Norwegian to wash his feet than in fighting Filipinos or something like that.  But as a rule, precept or example are pearls before swine in these back woods and I have not bothered myself in scattering many of them.  Besides I have a few beams to cast out of my own eyes before I bother with my brother's motes. 

If I had studied zoology more diligently when at school I could derive considerable satisfaction from the study of the human louse this winter and I would never be at a loss for specimens.  I never realized before what a complicated creature he was in fact I never made his acquaintance till last fall on the railroad.  They  are of all shapes and sizes, varied colors, some can run fast and some can scarcely wiggle but they all multiply vary rapidly and they all bite.  Nothing but boiling water will kill them, the most intense cold does not affect them.  Some people seem to derive a certain satisfaction from them which is embraced in a saying very much in vogue here.  It is "Blessed is the man who has body lice, for he knoweth the benefit of a scratch".  I think it deserves to  be ranked among the other beatitudes. ...I found an entirely new species this morning with no legs on it.<p>

August 5, 1907<p>

Dear Brother:<p>
I just returned from the  post office and got your letter.  I decided to answer
it right away conveying my heartfelt thanks for it.  I have kept in good health
which is what I hope for you there in my homeland.  Now I'll describe a bit of
what  the conditions are like over here.  There is a great strike going on.
There are many of us out of work.  I don't know how long the strike will last.
It's only been two and a half weeks since it  started and this isn't a very
pleasant time at all.  There are a 100 stooges with guns  paid by the mining
companies harassing the workers just like they're some animals.  A worker can't
peacefully walk down the street anymore. They say this America is the land of
the free but that's a lie.  A week ago Finnish socialist in Michigan had a
large summer festival and they used some old flags in the festival procession
just like in the customs is in Finland.  About 100 of them began the mark to
the festival site.  But the local police and their accomplices met them, took
their flags away and beat up 13 marchers and threw them in jail.<p>
<p>
You wrote that Kalle would like to come here.  I'll sure send him a ticket, but
not now.  I myself might have to leave here if this strike lasts very long.
The workers have decided to strike for a year if their demands aren't met.
They are asking for $3.00 a day and an eight -hour day.  If we win the strike,
I'll send Kalle a ticket right away.  Greetings to everyone in my homeland.<p>
Your brother,<p>
Victor Myllymake<p>

<h2>WORLD WAR ONE</h2></center></table>
<h4>
When World War I broke out in 1914, popular opinion in Minnesota initially echoed the sentiment of many Americans hoping to stear clear of the conflict in Europe: That year the organizers of the State Fair opted for the anti-war slogan "flour barrels are better than gun barrels."   <p>

But, of course, the U.S. did evenutally enter the war and the slogan writers fell in step:  "Eat onions to finish the fiendish Hun," one exclaimed.
Patriotism and anti-German sentiments reached extreme proportions.   At the behest of the Minnesota Legislature, the Commission on Public Safety was given near dictatorial powers to insure that all signs of disloyalty to the cause were squelched.   The Commission prohibitied aliens from
hunting game and teaching school, ordered all males over age 16 to work or fight and encouraged people to turn in "suspicious" neighbors.<p>

Beyond the speeches and victory rallies were the individual stories of boys going to off to be men...and often die in the process.</h4><p>

<b><i>Phillip Longyear, from St. Paul, writes home of his experience working
in the ambulance corps.</i></b><p>
<p>

Allentown, PA June 28, 1917<p>
<p>
Dear Mother,<p>
<p>
There are about three thousand nine hundred men here and it looks like a
regular war camp.  Everything is all bustle and excitement.  Everywhere you go
you hear bugles, see men drilling, etc.  We are quartered in the old fair
buildings and have one of the stock buildings.  Each of us has half a stall to
himself.  We all eat in one big room underneath the grandstand.  It looks like
a whole army in there.  They are all a fine looking bunch of college boys, and
treat newcomers as if they were old friends.   When we arrived, everybody
shouted at us, "Hello, boys, where are you from?"  <p>
<br>
Somewhere in France April 6, 1918<p>
<p>
Dear Mother,<p>
<p>
At last we are here.  We just had the censorship rules read to us and I am
quite discouraged as to what I can write.  You will have to use your
imagination as to what I omit. I witnessed my first shell fire day before
yesterday when the French artillery broke up a would be aerial raid on their
town by three German airplanes.  I was lying out on the grass in back of my
ambulance, reading a Saturday Evening Post.  It certainly was a pretty sight to
watch these fluffy balls of bursting shrapnel suddenly appear and remain
motionless against the blue sky. <p>
<br>
June 14, 1918<p>
<p>
Well, we have gotten to work at last, and this is the first time in several
days, I can't figure out how many, that I have had time to do anything.  I have
seen enough wounded to last me for the rest of the war, as far as curiosity
goes.  I have just gotten through cleaning the blood out of my car and it was
hardly a pleasant job.  I didn't mind the shells and gas, as much as I did the
sights and smells I had to go through.  After five days, during which they had
no time to care for the dead, the battlefield was hardly appetizing!  I became
so sick and disheartened at times, when I was almost too tired to drive, that I
would have given anything to have been away from all the revolting sights.  It
all seems so futile.<p>
<br>
Nov. 15, 1918<p>
Well, the event has happened at last, and none is more pleased than I am.  I
can imagine what must have been going on in any town in the states on the night
of the 11th and would have given anything to have been there.  But the
jubilation and excitement over here was about as great as it could be.  When
the news of the signing of the armistice came in, all whistles and bells began
blowing and everyone rushed out in the street.  Then a bunch of us decided to
walk to the next town where they were having a real dance, in a regular hall
with an American band.  That turned out to be the worst riot I ever hoped to
get in.  Everyone grabbed to person nearest and tried to dance.  The first
dance I got hold of an old man about eighty years old, so drunk he couldn't
tell his hand from his foot.  He cut the most extraordinary capers, dancing up
and down waving his arms and legs without noticing who was next to him.
Everyone laughed and whooped till the tears came and they were hoarse.<p>

Dear Commission,<p>
I am working and real hard labor too handling 150 b. potato sacks and other
stuff.  I was just enjoying a 3 weeks vacation, having quit the Post Office
after eleven months service.  Sure a man deserves a 3 weeks vacation after
working 11 months and not a day off.  It was only a spite work of some one whom
I have been trying to Americanize, one of our pro-German friends around here.
But just the same I am willing to work I am called for exam. at the Local board
next Friday.  I have  grandmother partial dependent on me but I claim no
exemption, willing to fight.  <p>

On Oct. 16th a transit drove into our garage, a Maxwell Roadster, bearing
license #129549 Wis.  We, trying to do our duty to our country, pasted a
Liberty Bond advertisement on his windshield, in the lower right hand corner.
In the morning the driver came into the garage, and seeing same pasted to his
windshield, made the following remark, "Who in Hell pasted that God Damn thing
on my windshield?  I don't want that Damn thing on there."  We consider him a
"slacker" and believe that he should be taken care of.<p>

Dear Sirs,<p>
I desire to ask whether or to moving picture operators, having no other
employment, come within the provisions of Order 37-the Work or Fight order.
There are two young men here in that class who do nothing whatever except to
drive around with young girls in "flivers" all day, and turn a crank for an
hour or two in the evening.  I am one of the peace officers appointed by your
body, and desire to assist in all ways in the enforcement of your orders. <p>

<h4>
For a brief time after the war and before the depression, prosperity seemed limitless and gaiety ran rampant.  The music was hot and so was the dancing, a fact that didn't please everybody<p></h4>
<hr>
<b><i>Mrs. Pritchard was a policewoman charged with "controlling" the
outlandish dancing that takes place in the Hibbing dance halls. A newspaper reported her efforts.</i></b><p>

February 23, 1922<p>
Those who desire to dance the "shimmy" will have to confine their
activities to some other place than Hibbing, says Mrs. Pritchard, policewoman,
who posted regulation in all the public dance halls of Hibbing this week.
Neither will check-to-cheek dancing be tolerated, the policewoman says.  With
the notices posted were photographs of the correct position, at least the only
position to be tolerated in the dancehalls of Hibbing.  This means that dancers
must hold their partners at a distance.  The strict regulations are the result
of the many public dances held in Hibbing where there were no regulations as to
the method of dancing, and cheek to cheek, sometimes even closer, was the rule
not the exception.<p>

<center><i>The </i> Bring Warm Clothes<i> Timeline:</i>
<h2>PRE-WORLD WAR II</h2>
</center></table>

<h4>The country was wracked by unemployment and none too far away the threat of World War was surfacing once again.  Though by no means exstinguished, the glimmer of the American Dream was, for many, definately fading.</h4>
<hr>

<b><i>
Linda and William Benitt began farming their "Apple
Acres Farm" near Hastings in 1930, the start of a decade marked by sagging crop
prices and drought.  They had a deep love for the land and a great concern
about the crisis in Europe.</b></i><p>

<b><i>Linda Benitt writes to her dear
friend Nellie Hubbell, whom she called Hubby.</i></b><p>

<p>
September 28,1938<p>
William has driven to an electric show in Dakota County., and while he contacts
the people he has come to see, I seize the chance to write to you.  It seems as
though all our thoughts and hearts these days are absorbed by the European
crisis.  When I am at home or candling in the  poultry house I have the radio
going steadily, and thus keep in close touch with each new development as fast
as it happens.  Tomorrow Hitler, Mussolini and Chamberlin meet in Munich.  What
will come of it? <p>
<p>
By the time this letter reaches you we should know whether it is peace or war
in the immediate future.  And war in Europe means war for us, too.  Let us not
delude ourselves about that.  As individuals we can do little, but we can live
in the agony of suspense of every European each hour that passes.  We shall
truly pray that Hitler's enormous egotism may feel a check in the world
disapproved of his militant methods and empirical aims.<p>
   <p>
In the meantime we go on living our lives of daily routine while we hang on the
abyss for our civilization.  Hens lay eggs, Hitler or no Hitler; crops must  be
harvested when ripe and the weather permits; little pigs eat and grow; children
must go to our democratic schools, etc.  So we cut our corn, shuck it , cut hay
and stack it; grade our eggs and market them; kill a fine beef our own table
and put it in frozen storage for the use during the coming year; and all the
time we draw nearer to the brink.<p>
Must go now to the chicks to put them to bed. <p>
Goodnight dear girl and love always.<p>
Linda<p>

<center><h1>Question & Answer<br>
with Arthur Agee and William Gates</h1></center>
<dl compact>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>What are your plans for the future?  Do you still plan to pursue a career playing for the National Basketball Association?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  I still want to play in the NBA, but if it doesn't work out, I'll play in the Canadian Basketball League during the summer.  I made a lot of contacts and received a lot of invitations from NBA players and camps when I played in the United States Basketball League (USBL).  So I'm going to wait and see where they lead.  I also want to go into acting-- can't let the talent go to waste.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  I'm planning a career in the field of communications -- marketing or public relations or maybe broadcasting.  If I had the chance to play in the NBA at this point, I would probably do it just to say that I made it.  Right now, I'm content being a fan of the game.
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>What are you doing now, four years after the film?  And how old are you?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  I'm 22.  I have a year of school to finish at Arkansas State University. And I played basketball for the USBL this  summer.  I'm also involved with a lot of community outreach  programs.  Besides that, I've just been doing a lot of speaking engagements and appearances.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  I'm 23.  I'll be returning to Marquette University in Wisconsin this fall to work on completing my degree in  communication.  Also, I'm involved in several organizations to  help inner-city kids in Chicago achieve their dreams of  academics as well as athletics.  I also have many speaking  engagements like Arthur.
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>How has the film affected your lives?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  A lot of people only see me as a "movie star," instead of a real person.  My life is about the same [as William's].  I haven't  changed one bit.  I still live in my same neighborhood, go to the  corner store, and hang around the same friends.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  I think we've been under a microscope from the standpoint of getting reviewed by critics.  But, overall, it's been an incredible experience -- one good thing after another.  I mean, people are actually sitting at the games, waiting to talk to me about what I'm going to do next, so it's been a great opportunity.
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big> 
<dd>What were some aspects of your life that you think the film missed?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  William and I used to hang out all the time on the weekends.  We grew up together, we knew each other from the neighborhood -- even before the film project began.  When we were in grammar school, we used to play against each other all  the time.  And we were still friends after I left St. Joe's.  I also  have a stronger relationship with my father now than the way  it was presented at the end of the film.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  Well, my brother Curtis.  I mean, we've always had a strong relationship.  But in the film, he looked like a villain -- always criticizing his little brother because he wasn't doing well.  In reality, there were times when I felt he was the only person in my corner.  There should have been more scenes with him saying supportive things--like when I was going away to college, you can really see our love for each other.
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>What messages do you hope young people get from the film?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  I want to be remembered by my success and my  winning spirit.  I made it when other people didn't think I could.   I did things that people said I couldn't do.  The film doesn't just represent our lives--it represents a lot of other people's lives and other people's families.  It also shows what really happens in the inner city.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  You can do anything you want to do -- be who you want to be.  Whether that's a doctor or a lawyer or a ball player. Also, being a teen parent is tough, particularly if you come from a single parent home.   Instead of dodging my responsibilities, I used my situation as an opportunity to better someone else's life...my daughter's.
<p>

<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>Throughout the film, both of you were compared to NBA star Isiah Thomas.  Did this put additional pressure on you as kids?  
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  Not really.  He is still a hero to me, but he is not bigger than my mom and dad.  I love the way he conducts his business off the floor.
 <p> 

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  Isiah was the reason I went to St. Joseph.  At the time, there were not a lot of "big" players from Chicago.  Because Isiah had attended the school, we were compared a lot.  Our games are very different.  If I had gone to another school, I probably would have been compared to someone else.
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>What lessons have you learned about balancing academics with athletics?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  Set goals and maintain the discipline to achieve them. Education became very important to me for several reasons.  I quickly learned that if I didn't have good grades, I couldn't play ball.  Though it was a challenge, I was determined to do well. Basketball got me into college and soon I will be earning a  degree.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  It is important to stay on top of your game, on and off the court.  I had to do a real balancing act between school and basketball because I also had to maintain a job to provide for my family.  I learned to take care of business and always look at the bigger and better picture.
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>William, do your knee injuries have anything to do with not  pursuing a career in basketball?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  Definitely.  Although I came back and recovered from my injuries in high school, I never came back to playing the style I was used to playing.  I will never know how good I could have become.  I never lost a love for the game, but it was disappointing to me that I couldn't do the same things I was used to doing---playing the way I was used to playing.
<p>

<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>During the making of the film, were there times when you felt that the filmmakers were being too invasive in your personal 	life?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  Throughout the movie, the filmmakers became family. There were a few times when we didn't want them around. William and I were young and wanted our privacy.  We wanted to be able to talk about girls or whatever, <u>by ourselves</u>, and  they agreed.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  After a while, we got used to having the camera follow us around all the time.  However, there were a couple instances   when the filmmakers and I would sit down to discuss certain family situations that I didn't want to be a part of the film.  There were things in our lives that we didn't want to share with everyone in America. 
<p>
<hr><dt><font size=+1><big><b>Q:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd>What advice what you give to young people?
<p>
<dt><font size=+1><big><b>A:</b></font size=+1></big>
<dd><big><font size=+1><b>Arthur</b></font size=+1></big>:  Don't say "can't."  Once you say you can't do something, that's a strike against yourself.  Be honest and straightforward and don't beat around the bush about anything you want to say.
<p>

<p><big><font size=+1><b>William</b></font size=+1></big>:  A lot of kids look to sports figures or even me and Arthur as role models.  The best role models are parents. Heroes may fall, but family is there forever.

<center><h2><b>ARTHUR AGEE, JR.</b></h2>
<h3>Biography</h3></center>
<BR>


On many inner-city playgrounds, the game of basketball can be more than a recreational pastime for neighborhood kids.  For Arthur Agee, basketball was a potential "ticket to success" and an escape from family problems.  His story of pursuing a dream to play for the NBA is chronicled in the award-winning film, <b>Hoop Dreams</b>.<p>
	
"Basketball is what took me away from my problems at home," says Agee, now 22.  "When things were going wrong, I would take a basketball and go the playground...that was my relief."<p>
<IMG  Align=Right SRC="stillsm/armomdegree.jpg" alt="[Pix: Sheila Agee graduation]" width=138 height=115 hspace=10  vspace=10>
Agee was born in Chicago, IL, on October 22, 1972.  He was the middle child between an older sister and a younger brother.  During his adolescent years, Agee's mother Sheila, who he describes as "the best woman in the world," worked while attending nursing school.  <IMG  Align=Left SRC="stillsm/ardadcheer.jpg" alt="[Pix: Bo Agee cheers Arthur on]" width=152 height=141 hspace=10  vspace=10>His father "Bo" struggled with a substance abuse problem and tried to find steady work.<p>

At 14, Agee was recruited by an athletic scout to attend St. Joseph High School, a Catholic prep school.  Though he worked diligently to succeed on and off the court, Agee was forced to leave the school because his parents could no longer afford the pricey tuition.  He transferred to Marshall High School where he led the varsity basketball team to a third place finish at the Illinois State Basketball Tournament during his senior year.  
He went on to attend Mineral Area Junior College for two years, and is currently a student at Arkansas State University on a basketball scholarship.
<IMG  Align=Right SRC="stillsm/arontv.jpg" alt="[Pix: Arthur on TV]" width=173 height=130 hspace=10  vspace=10>
<p>
Agee's major is radio/television, but he still passionately aspires to play professional basketball.  He has played in the United States Basketball League (USBL) and hopes to continue his basketball career in the NBA or the Continental Basketball Association (CBA).  Agee claims, "as long as I'm living and I know to myself that I can play this game, I will keep knocking at the door!"<p>

Believing he is "a hero you can touch," Agee still lives in his Chicago neighborhood.  He has a three-year-old son, Anthony, and a two-year-old daughter, Ashlee.  Aside from basketball, he enjoys going to the movies and making public appearances with longtime friend William Gates, who is also featured in <b>Hoop Dreams</b>. <br><br>

<center><h2><b>WILLIAM GATES</b></h2></center>
<center><h3>Biography</h3></center>

<br clear=all>
Being a talented athlete and a "clean cut" kid made William Gates a role model in his Chicago neighborhood at a young age. However, at 14, Gates unexpectedly reached local super stardom, and ultimately national recognition when he agreed to participate in the award-winning documentary, <b>Hoop Dreams</b>.<p>

"I had no idea in the beginning that the film was going to be as intense and time consuming as it was," recalls Gates, now 23.  "Being followed around by a movie camera almost every day was an amazing experience, particularly in the inner city."<p>
<IMG  Align=Right SRC="stillsm/wmmom.jpg" alt="[Pix: Emma Gates, Williams' mom]" height=118 width=136 hspace=10 vspace=10>
Born on December 28, 1971, in Chicago, IL, Gates' life has been chock-full of what he calls "amazing experiences."  The youngest of six siblings, Gates describes his family as "one of the happiest poor families in the neighborhood." He credits his single mother, Emma, who worked as a nursing assistant,  as being the greatest supporter of his dream to play professional basketball for the NBA.<p>
<IMG  Align=Left SRC="stillsm/wmfreethrow.jpg" alt="[Pix: Gates at the free throw line]" width=154 height=114 hspace=10 vspace=10>
Gates pursued his goal through an athletic scholarship at St. Joseph High School, a Catholic prep school.  Amidst personal and academic struggles, including physical injuries, financial hardships and teen parenting, Gates persevered to  graduate.  Because of his exceptional athletic abilities, he was heavily recruited by scores of major universities and colleges.<p>

Currently,  Gates is a senior at Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI.  He played on the basketball team for three years, including the 1994-95 NIT championship team.  He is majoring in communications and plans to pursue a career in marketing, public relations or broadcasting.  He has had several auditions for television and film roles, and receives numerous speaking invitations along with his longtime friend Arthur Agee, who is also featured in <b>Hoop Dreams</b>.<p>

Aside from playing basketball for fun or just being a fan of the game, Gates is an avid bowler and basketball card collector.  He lives in Milwaukee, with his wife Catherine, and their two children, Alicia and William Jr.

<H3>About the Film</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="graphics/arlayupprint.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 height=266 width=167 alt="[Pix: a layup by Agee]">
First exhibited at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival where it won the
audience award for best documentary, <b>HOOP DREAMS</b> is the remarkable
true story of two American dreamers; an intimate reflection of
contemporary American inner-city culture, following two ordinary young
men on the courts of the game they love.  Plucked from the streets and
given the opportunity to attend a "white" prep school and play for a
legendary high school coach, William Gates and Arthur Agee both soon
discover that their dreams of NBA glory become obscured amid the intense
pressures of academics, family life, economics and athletic
competitiveness.
<P>
But most importantly, both boys remain focused
on their dream, no matter how hard tragedy strikes or how desperate
their situation becomes.  It is their faith in the game that unites
their family and gives each person hope.  And it is this faith that
ultimately allows them to build upon their failures as well as their
triumphs and make for themselves a potentially better life.
<P>
"At its center, we wanted the film to be warm and emotional," says producer
Peter Gilbert.  "We want people to see these families as going through
some very rough times, overcoming a lot of obstacles, and rising above
some of the typical media stereotypes that people have about inner-city
families."
<P>
<IMG SRC="graphics/poster.gif" ALT="Hoop Dreams Poster" ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=5 HSPACE=10 height=213 width=136><b>HOOP DREAMS</b> began as a very modest film.  Back in 1986,
the filmmakers approached Gordon Quinn of Kartemquin Films, the
legendary documentary production company, about making a short film
which would examine the culture of "street basketball" on Chicago's
playground courts.
<P>
But with the discovery of William and Arthur,
and support and guidance from Kartemquin, the film grew in ambition and
scope.  No longer a film short, the project realized its own impossible
dream of becoming an epic chronicle of the boys and their families'
lives over nearly five years.
<P>
Filmmakers Steve James, Frederick
Marx, and Peter Gilbert collected 250 hours of film conducting
interviews with the boys and their families and friends, eavesdropping
on birthday parties and nightly dinners, filming practice sessions as
well as games.  The result is a rich and complex portrait of two
inner-city boys growing up with the Dream.
<P>
Director Steve James,
a longtime basketball player and fan like his colleagues, speaks about
the boys' intense desire to escape their complex and violent worlds
through basketball:  "The dream is about far more than the fantasy of
playing in the NBA.  It provides kids like William and Arthur with an
identity and real opportunities.  It can be a daily escape from the hard
realities of the inner city and even help hold their families together. 
If they risk tragedy by caring too much about basketball, it's because
the game is one of the precious few ways they know of to achieve a
better life."
<P>
Even with so much being written about the
exploitation of athletes in college basketball, <b>HOOP DREAMS</b> is the
first major film to present the complex issue of kids, sports and
education at the high school level, where abuse of power and rigorous
adherence to the letter of the law have even more powerful
ramifications.
<P>
"We want viewers to take a good, hard look at the
system of sports in America today, and how it is affecting kids at an
increasingly younger age, starting in grammar school," adds producer
Frederick Marx.  "It puts them through the mill before they even have a
chance of knowing who they are."
<P>
To be sure, basketball has, over
the past fifteen years, become America's most high-profile (and
profitable) sport.  Once culturally invisible, the NBA has become one of
the decade's top international marketing successes, with this year's
finals telecast in over 100 nations around the world.  The game has
consciously made an effort to embrace the high-powered aggressive
stylings of the "street" game as played in America's inner cities,
promoting the dominating, in-your-face approach of superstars like
Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.
<P>
<IMG SRC="stillsm/wmchampagne.jpg" ALT="William Gates" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE="5" HSPACE="10" width=192 height=144>As William and Arthur make the uneasy transition from the ill-kept
concrete courts of their neighborhood to the polished wooden floors of
St. Joseph High School, we meet the members of their family who will
share in their dreams and alter their destiny over the next few years: 
Curtis Gates, William's older brother who once dreamed of a basketball
career himself but now works at a low-paying job without much future;
Arthur "Bo" Agee, whose own commitment as a father will be tested as he
battles addiction; the boys' devoted mothers, each still clinging on to
their own dreams of success for themselves and their families as they
struggle to remain afloat economically and emotionally.  Indeed, we
discover that the dreams of basketball glory at the center of the film
are dreams of entire families, not just two boys.  We watch each family
and each individual compare events in the lives of Arthur and William
against their own personal definitions of success and failure -- both
motivating Arthur and William yet increasing the pressure on them as
well.
<P>
We also meet the assortment of talent scouts, coaches and
celebrity figures who most directly influence the direction of the boys'
lives:  Earl Smith, the longtime Chicago street scout who recommends
Arthur, barely an adolescent, for the school team; Gene Pingatore, St.
Joseph's legendary coach, who discovered and developed NBA superstar
Isiah Thomas; and Patricia Weir, a "friend" of St. Joseph's who becomes
a "sponsor" for one of the boys that  insures his tuition will be paid
at the school.  Isiah Thomas himself, as well as Bobby Knight, Dick
Vitale and Spike Lee, all manage to work their way into the boys' lives,
each offering their perspective on the game of basketball and the life
of a basketball player.
<P>
<IMG SRC="stillsm/wmgradchild.jpg" ALT="William graduating" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE="5" height=128 width=155>What emerges from <b>HOOP DREAMS</b> is far more than a sympathetic portrait
of two black teenagers reaching for the stars.  While remaining epic in
scope, it manages to be intimate in detail, chronicling the universal
process of growing up, coming of age, the love and conflict between
fathers and sons, brothers, best friends and spouses.  It's about
success and failure not just on the court, but in school, at home, and
ultimately, in society.  And it does it in a way that no other film on
sports has done before:  it gives viewers an intimate look at the
pursuit of the basketball dream while it is actually happening.

<H1>Reviews of "Hoop Dreams"</H1>
<BR>
<BR>

"The beauty and the anguish of ['Hoop Dreams'] is that it cuts through generalities and cliches, cuts through the stereotypes, to deal with individuals, with real people, as it focuses on the lives of William Gates and Arthur Agee."
<P>

<B>-Ira Berkow, THE NEW YORK TIMES</B><P>
<BR>


"[In 'Hoop Dreams'] we see a portrait of inner-city struggle and survival shorn of the sound-bite cliches of TV and the sensationalist reductionism of Hollywood 'hood flicks.'  'Hoop Dreams' has all the suspense of a soap opera, but without the manipulation.  It lets us draw our own conclusions, never forcing the story to fit a preordained agenda, never making easy generalizations out of the lives it examines with such clear-eyed generosity."
<P>
<B>-David Ansen with Peter Annin, NEWSWEEK</B><P>
<BR>

"The thirteen nominations bestowed upon the box-office smash 'Forrest Gump' and the Motion Picture Academy's simultaneous dissing of the acclaimed inner-city basketball
documentary 'Hoop Dreams'...is more than strange: it's weird."
<P>
<B>-Roger Angell, THE NEW YORKER</B><P>
<BR clear=all>

"In a bizarre decision [Motion Picture Academy] judges denied 'Hoop Dreams' a major Oscar nomination, even in the documentary category.  But filmgoers and critics have been uniformly impressed with the movie's narrative drama and social importance. More than 100 critics ranked 'Hoop Dreams' among last year's top 10 films."
<P>
<B>-Jonathan Alter, USA WEEKEND</B><P>
<BR>
"Once in a while ...a documentarian comes along who appreciates both factual detail and higher truth, and has 
 the artistry to combine them, producing non-fiction films of blinding power...Now out of Chicago comes that rare thing -- a documentary that admirably combines the rigors and constraints of journalism with the transcendent force of great fiction.  And the subject isn't war or terrorism or political realignment -- it's basketball."
<P>
<B>-Julie Salamon, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</B><P>
<BR>

"The makers of 'Hoop Dreams'...took the risk of allowing themselves to react to events as they happened: not judging, not forcing the action, not turning off the cameras when the story seemed to be arranging itself into lucid, temptingly schematic one-wins-one-loses structure.  What makes 'Hoop Dreams' such a rich, clear-eyed vision of inner-city life is that it celebrates, and evokes in the audience, the ambiguous thrill of not knowing how things are going to turn out, the joy of pure potential."
<P>
<B>-Terrence Rafferty, THE NEW YORKER</B><P>
<BR>

"I hope that 'Hoop Dreams'...serve[s] as an inspiration to kids all across this country who are growing up in very hard circumstances.  They can make it.  They can  be something."
<P>
<B>-Bill Clinton, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</B><P>

<BR>
	Kartemquin Films was established in 1966 by Gordon Quinn and Jerry Blumenthal as a documentary production company in Chicago, IL.<BR>
<BR>
	The company's first film, <B>Home for Life</B>, was a powerful study of life in a nursing home, and won awards at the Edinburgh and  Chicago International Film Festivals.  The film, which investigated and critiqued American society by letting real people tell their own stories, set the tone for the type of projects the company would produce during the next 30 years.<BR>
<br>
	Such films include <B>Trick Bag</B> (on racism), <B>Now We Live On Clifton</B> (on gentrification), and <B>Chicago Maternity Center</B> (on the politics of women's health care).  Other documentaries include <B>Taylor Chain I, Taylor Chain II</B> and <B>The Last Pullman Car</B>, films about the labor movement.  <BR>
<br>
	<B>Hoop Dreams</B> began in concept as a documentary for public television.  After winning the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival, the project was picked up by Fine Line Features and released theatrically as a feature film.  An educational companion piece, <B>Higher Goals</B>, spearheaded a nationwide stay-in-school outreach campaign and was nominated for a daytime Emmy award. <BR>
<br>
	Quinn and Blumenthal have collaborated with numerous filmmakers and organizations during their years of filmmaking to sponsor educational and industrial programs on a wide range of topics: corporate image, social service, and medical issues, among others.  Currently, Kartemquin has in development <B>Grassroots Journal</B>, an information-based series for and about people who are engaged in grassroots activities.  Another documentary, <B>Chicago Crossings: African Americans & American Jews</B>, is intended to generate public dialogue on race relations.

<H1>Transcript of "Hoop Dreams" Filmmaker Peter Gilbert's
Conference on America Online, 3/7/95</H1><HR>

<big><FONT SIZE=+1>OnlineHost:</FONT></big>
  Tonight's Hollywood Online's Inside Hollywood is  pleased
to present Peter Gilbert, filmmaker from "Hoop Dreams", to discuss this
remarkable film and the Academy snub. First exhibited in the 1994
Sundance Film Festival where it won the audience award for best
documentary, HOOP DREAMS is the remarkable true story of two American
dreamers; an intimate reflection of contemporary American inner-city
culture, following two ordinary young men on the courts of the game they
love. 
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>OnlineHost:</FONT></big>
  Hoop Dreams was selected as the Best Film of the
year by both Siskel and Ebert, and also by Kenneth Turan of the Los
Angeles Times. It has been selected as the Best Documentary by the New
York Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics, Texas Film Critics, Boston
Film Critics, National Board of Review, National Society of Film Critics
and the Chicago Film Critics.
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>OnlineHost:</FONT></big>
  It has received
Special Achievement Awards from IFP and the Producers Guild and has been
nominated by the DGA for Best Documentary and by ACE, the editor's
guild. With all of the critical accolades which "Hoop Dreams" received,
it has only received an Academy Award nomination for Best Editing. The
failure of the Academy to nominate "Hoop Dreams" in the Best Documentary
category has caused an uproar, which provoked the head of the Academy to
announce the launch of an investigation into the nomination procedure of
this committee in response to the overwhelming reaction to the snub of
Hoop Dreams.
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>OnlineHost:</FONT></big>
  Peter Gilbert, one of the three filmmakers and
Director of Photography for "Hoop Dreams, is based in Chicago. His film
credits include the 1990 Academy Award winning, feature-length
documentary, "American Dream," directed by Barbara  Kopple; "A Long Way
Home," directed by Michael Apted, produced and distributed worldwide by
Granada TV; the Peabody Award winning "Age 7 in America," produced by
Michael Apted and directed by Phil Joanou, which was broadcast on
CBS-TV; and "Bookmark: Day of the Dead," produced and directed for the
BBC.
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>OnlineHost:</FONT></big>
  Recently, Gilbert was Director of Photography
for the ABC weekly television drama, "Missing Persons," starring Daniel
J. Travanti. Born in Chicago, he is a graduate of New York University
Film School, and currently resides in Chicago.

Berlin, host of Hollywood Online's Inside Hollywood, located  online at

<big><font size=+1>HOL Live:</FONT></big>
  And I am your host for this
evening, coming to you live from the Hollywood Online offices.
Greetings, everyone!
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  Hi Joey, nice to be online!</P><HR>
<P>
<A NAME="questions"><big><FONT SIZE=+1>JoeyBerlin:</FONT></big>
 </A> Peter, let's get right to it.  Do you feel snubbed by
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences?
<p>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER
GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  I don't feel "snubbed," I feel like I've joined an exclusive
club by not being nominated for best documentary. Filmmakers like
Michael Apted, Errol Morris, and Michael Moore.PJ Carome.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  How much did you know about William and Arthur before
starting to shoot? What made you   select them as your two subjects?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  We basically found the kids exactly the way you see it
in the film.    Earl Smith led us to Arthur Agee, and then brought us
and his family out to St. Joseph's High School.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
 Great movie.  Can you tell us how Arthur is doing in Arkansas? And does
he any chance of playing ball in Europe next year?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER
GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  Arthur just finished his season at AK State.  He was the
starting point guard.  He played very strong in the 2nd half of the
season, and will graduate college in December.  He's hoping to get asked
to NBA and CAB try-outs.  He still has the dream.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  When you started filming, did you have any
inkling that the stories of these two kids would encompass so many
different issues? It must have been a documentarian's dream!
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER
GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  When we started, we knew that the subject matter had a great
wealth of experiences that we could put on the screen, but we had no
idea how compelling the kids their families' were going to be.  They
just kept growing exponentially as the years went on bringing in more
complex issues at every twist and turn.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  Some
of the folks at St Joe's (coach, guy in finance office) seemed to really
themselves as caring only about $$ and wins, and not about the kids they
were dealing with.  How did you get them to give you permission to film
and use the footage?<
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  We were very honest and
straightforward with them from the beginning, and I don't think they
really totally understood what we were making the film about.  We got
normal, standard release forms from all the participants.  St Josephs
actually does a lot to help kids.  They helped William which we show in
the film very vividly.  It's just, with Arthur, that we felt there were
some problems   It's always hard for kids when adults expect them to
come through for them and actually give the adult the dream they wanted
instead of the kid.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  How does it feel to have some of the biggest
names in Hollywood backing you up?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  From when
the film was discovered one year ago at Sundance, the Hollywood film
community has really embraced the film.  That's why I don't feel snubbed
about the Academy Awards, because I know so many people in the Hollywood
community love and support the film.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  How
long did it take you to edit all the film into the movie we saw on
screen?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  We edited the film for 2 and a half years. 
We had 250 hours of material, which we edited down to two hours and
fifty minutes.  Our first rough cut was 8 hours long.  What a nightmare!
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Fine Line2:</FONT></big>
  In fictional films, you get as many takes
as you want to get a shot the way you want it. In Hoop Dreams, there are
so many incredible moments that you captured without a second chance. 
From the shot of Arthur grinning in the car at the sound of Isaiah
Thomas's name, to the crucial free throws by William.  How did it feel
to get those shots, and were there some that you missed because you
didn't get a second chance?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  When you capture
a moment in real life, a moment that rings true, such as Shelia
graduating from nursing school, there is no other high like it.  It only
happens once, and you have to...   anticipate and be ready to capture
it, as well as capture coverage, so that you can lengthen and shorten it
in the editing.  I learned from really great filmmakers like Barbara
Kopple, Michael Apted, and Gordon Quinn, how to photograph films and
anticipate the actions of real people.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
 Everyone I know who has seen "Hoop Dreams'' -- a really diverse group of
people -- has loved it.  So what's the Academy's hangup?  Is it
something simple, such as they just don't "get" documentaries, or
something a little more complicated, such as lack of sympathy with the
kid protagonists -- the much-feared young black male?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  The Academy has a history of not nominating
popular, distributed documentaries.   We want to reform how
documentaries are chosen.  Documentary filmmakers are an ethnically
diverse..   group who are based nationwide, not just in Los Angeles like
the Hollywood feature film community.   Kartemquin Films in Chicago,
where Hoop Dreams was produced, has been making documentary for 30
years.  It would be great if studios like Kartemquin and other
documentary filmmakers from all over the country could vote on the best
documentary of the year for the Oscars.   As it stands now, you have to
live in LA, and go to screenings to vote for the films.  We would like
to use videotape so documentarians all over the country could vote for
their peers.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>JoeyBerlin:</FONT></big>
  Do you think Arthur Hiller's
examination of the doc nominating process will lead to reform?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  I hope it does, Joey.  When the first publicity came
out, he was talking about acting very quickly in regards to looking into
the committee's actions.  He seems to have backed off lately.   We
intend to keep pushing so that the process is reformed for next year.  I
hope people understand it's not sour grapes on our part. - we feel bad
for the five documentary nominees, because I'm sure all their films are
good, and they are getting no publicity because of the clamor over Hoop
Dreams.   This seems to happen all the time in the documentary category.
 You never see these controversies when the editors vote for editing,
the directors vote for directing, etc.  We just want it reformed to end
the controversy and encourage the art of making documentary films.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>HOL Live:</FONT></big>
  GTMarmots has read in Adweek and the Daily News that
Peter and Steve are directing commercials for Prime Sports.  How does
their vision translate to television advertising?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Fine
Line2:</FONT></big>
  (BTW, Steve is Steve James, the Director of Hoop Dreams.)
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  We've made all kinds of films over the last 15 years to
make a living - let's talk about Hoop Dreams.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  Was it more or less difficult to get support
for this film vs. others you have done?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  It's hard to make any film.  The funding for
this film was very difficult.  At Kartemquin films, we have a good track
record of receiving grants and public support from the NEA, CPB, and
ITVS.   We started the film with NEA money (only $2500 for the first 3
years), then public television kicked in with an additional amount to
help us out.  Write your Senators and Congressmen to gain support for
the arts!  Don't let PBS die - it may not be perfect, but it's very
important for independent filmmakers.  Hoop Dreams and Kartemquin Films
needed PBS to help us make films and survive!  It was hard to get
funding in general because the film was about sports and inner-city
kids.  Lots of funding organizations don't take sports as a serious way
to look into our society.  It was an uphill battle.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  How difficult is it to get funding for
documentary projects?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  It is painful, but not insurmountable.  You
just have to have passion for your film.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  Is
the treatment of William and Arthur typical of high school athletes?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  That's a difficult question to answer - I'm
not a journalist or a sociologist.  I'm a filmmaker.   It certainly was
representative of the sports scene that we witnessed for 5 years in
Chicago.   It's a complex question.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  Did you
have more than just two player-subjects when you were first starting the
project?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  We researched a couple of kids other than
William and Arthur, but what you see is what you get in the film.  We
found the kids just the way it's portrayed in the film - off the
playgrounds Chicago.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  I heard that Spike Lee
is going to direct the sequel, is that true? Will there be a sequel?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  Spike Lee is executive-producing for Turner Pictures,
are-make of Hoop Dreams.  It's possible he'll direct it.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>

 Have William and Arthur seen the film? And if so what are their
opinions of it?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  They've both seen the film
(many times).  They both love the film, because the feel as though their
stories were honestly told.  They've been proud to be a part of the Hoop
Dreams phenomenon.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  How much do you think the
two young men reacted differently because the cameras were always
around?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  Actually, I'm always surprised how
little the camera affects real life.  Arthur still got booted out of St.
Joes.  His dad still had a drug problem.  William had a child when he
was 15.   So I don't think the camera changes real life very much.  I
think we wore them down in the first year   and they just ignored it
after that.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
  After five years, what went into
your decision to stop filming?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  What hooked us into filming for five years was
coach Pingatore's promise to Arthur to...   help him get in to college. 
Then it seemed right to film the kids through high school to see what
would happen to them.  It just was a logical choice.
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>Question:</FONT></big>
 Did you shoot on film or video, and did you edit digitally?
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  We shot on video tape, beta-cam.  There was
no way we could have afforded to shoot on film.  We did not edit
digitally - we edited on VHS off-line, because of the amount of material
we had.
<P>
No computer could take 250 raw hours of footage (none
that we could afford).
<HR><P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>HOL Live:</FONT></big>
  JasBeMe wants to know
that with documentaries such as Hoop Dreams being so successful in
mainstream, where is the dividing line between feature and
documentaries, and should there be one.
<P>
<big><FONT SIZE=+1>PETER GILBERT:</FONT></big>
  Good
storytelling is good storytelling.  Hoop Dreams tells a narrative, the
same as any other Hollywood feature.  It just has all the twist and
turns of real life.

<center><h1><b>A Special Reunion:</b></h1>
<h1>Life After "Hoop Dreams"</h1></center>
<BR clear=all>

<b>Hoop Dreams</b>, originally produced for PBS by Kartemquin Films, Chicago, and KTCA, St. Paul / Minneapolis, makes its television debut on PBS on Wednesday, November 15, 1995, at 8PM (ET).     The broadcast will be immediately followed by <b>A Hoop Dreams Reunion</b>, a 30-minute update that will include never-before-seen footage of Gates and Agee, and their families, in addition to exclusive interviews with the filmmakers.  The PBS broadcast of <b>Hoop Dreams</b> is sponsored by The Chrysler Corporation.
<p>
<b>Hoop Dreams</b> chronicles the lives of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two inner-city Chicago youths with aspirations of playing professional basketball.  Their moving tale of courage and hope against insurmountable odds captured the hearts of America and received much critical acclaim, including the audience award for best documentary at the Sundance Film Festival.  <p>
<IMG  Align=Right SRC="stillsm/wmarhug.jpg" alt="[Pix: William and Arthur hugging]" width=166 height=146 hspace=10>
	The three-hour documentary spans four years (ages 14 to 18), from the time William and Arthur leave elementary school until they graduate from high school in 1991 and embark on the journey to higher education -- a journey made possible through scholarships for their basketball prowess.<p>

	Four years later, after the cameras stopped rolling, and far from the concrete Chicago neighborhood they roamed as children, Agee, 22, and Gates, 23, are now college students.  Agee currently plays ball at Arkansas State University and has played with the United States Basketball League (USBL).  He plans to continue a professional sports career with the National Basketball Association after he graduates, however, he also has other aspirations, including acting and stand up comedy.
<p>
	"If basketball never happened, I would still be successful person," he explained. "I'm very versatile.  I can do anything."
<p>
	Gates, on the other hand, considers himself more of "businessman" and conducts himself accordingly.  He wears suits to press conferences and speaks in a deliberate tone.  And basketball takes a back seat to obtaining his communication degree at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
<p>
	"If I had the chance to play [in the NBA], it would be just to say that I made it," he said.  "Right now, I am more a fan of the game, I like to watch other people play more."
<p>
<IMG  Align=left SRC="stillsm/wmbaby.jpg" alt="[Pix: William with daughter]" height=120 width=160 hspace=10>Gates plans to pursue a career in marketing, public relations or broadcasting.  He currently lives in Milwaukee with his wife, Catherine (his childhood sweetheart from the film), and their two young children, Alicia and William Jr.  Even though his daughter was born when he was in tenth grade, it is not a course Gates would recommend for other high school students.
<p>
	"At that particular time, everybody in our neighborhood was getting killed...everybody was dying," he explained.  "I thought that if something happened to me, I need to leave something behind to say that I was here."
<p>
	But between ducking stray bullets and living between his mother's and older sister's homes while going to school, Gates took his parental role seriously -- and still does.  He realizes the importance of role models and learned from his own father's absence that children need direction and attention.
<p>
	"I knew early on that if I ever had a kid, I wasn't going to treat my child the same way I was brought up...fatherless," he said.  "What kids learn at home definitely makes an impact on whether or not they become successful."
<p>
	In fact, Gates credits the birth of his first child as being the impetus to help him strive for something better.
<p>
	"Aspiring to achieve my dreams became a greater mission after the baby was born," he explained.  "I began to try to accomplish something for somebody else, not just myself.  I began to carry the load for myself and the family I just created."
<p>
	Agee, who also has two children (Anthony, 3, and Ashlee, 2), is another avid believer in role models.  Like Gates, he had both positive and negative influences that shaped his attitudes about life and how to be successful.  His greatest role model is his mother, Sheila, and he plans to teach his children what she imparted to him at a young age.
<p>
<IMG  Align=Right SRC="stillsm/arbday.jpg" alt="[Pix: Arthur with birthday cake]" width=160 height=120 hspace=10>
	"Be honest and straightforward," he repeated.  "Strive to be better than your parents."
	It is a tribute to his character that Agee never took up drugs, as a hobby or career, despite the fact that the neighborhood was littered with dope dealers and his own father, Arthur Sr., ("Bo"), had a substance abuse problem that eventually led to his parents' breakup.
<p>
	"When my family was down and broken apart, I had the courage and discipline to leave and go to college, and try to make something better for myself," he said proudly.  "Can't isn't even a word in my vocabulary."
<p>
	Their life lessons are grist for the mill of wisdom that Agee and Gates share with youngsters via their numerous speaking engagements at schools and youth basketball camps across the country.  They are also involved in several non-profit organizations which promote education and provide youths with alternatives to gangs and drugs.  They are currently on tour promoting the Chrysler <b>"Hoop Dreams" Challenge</b>, a community/educational outreach campaign designed to take the messages from the film into schools and community organizations.
<p>
	"I'm bringing hope to a lot of kids who need to know that they can succeed," Agee said.  "I made it when other people didn't think I could.  I just hope my life experiences will inspire and encourage others."
	<p>
	The 30-minute update program, <b>A Hoop Dreams Reunion</b>, reunites Agee and Gates with filmmakers Peter Gilbert, Steve James and Frederick Marx, during an exclusive in-studio interview focusing on the many issues raised by the documentary.  
<p>
	Agee and Gates discuss such topics as how their lives have changed since the film's national theatrical debut, and their new-found fame as they tour cities and towns sharing their life experiences with young men and women.  They also discuss how they feel about being role models for American youth, and their dreams and goals for the future.  
<p>
	Fox-TV sportscaster James Brown, a 10-year veteran of CBS Sports, and currently the co-host of Fox's "NFL Sunday," hosts <b>A Hoop Dreams Reunion</b>.  Brown was a 1973 fourth-round draft pick chosen by the NBA's Atlanta Hawks shortly after he graduated from Harvard University with a degree in American Government.  From 1978 to 1983, he co-hosted two weekly sports programs near Washington, D.C., and served as an analyst for the NBA's Washington Bullets local broadcasts.
<p>
	"I really wanted to be involved with this project because it was much more in-depth than other documentaries of this type," Brown said in announcing his involvement with the project. 
<p>
	"I want to help bring serious examination to the issues raised by the film. It's important for people to know what happens to kids after their playing days . . . I don't think there is enough attention given to that matter," he added.  "I've been there, I know."

He who conceals his disease cannot expect to be cured.<br>

<p>
Often times in communities of color, issues of health are concealed through our own apathy or our governments policy.  So Don't Believe The Hype will try to shed some light on health related issues.
<p>
The Hype crew felt health was an important topic since the condition of youth of color is effected most by their mental, spiritual, and physical well-being.   
<p>
Among the discussion topics will be nutrition.  From school lunch programs to the lack of affordable food in the corner stores of the inner-city, what are problems and solutions regarding our diets?  
Ann
<p>
The Hype youth crew also explores the more politicized issue of health care.  Who has access to quality health care?  How do young mothers, the homeless, and immigrants get access to decent health care?  Joining the Hype crew to discusses these issues are Beverly Propes ----- and Laura Nystrom of the ------.
<p>
Another issue the crew felt important to investigate is mental health.  Dialog will include getting beyond the myths of mental illness as well as discussing the impact oppression and life in the 'hood has on a young person's state of mind.  Noted African American psychologist and professor Dr. John Taborn sits in with the Hype crew and defines the difference between stress and distress.
<p>
Culturally specific solutions will be explored with the help of Don Blackhawk, a Native American spiritual leader from the Juel Fairbanks ------.

Hype 101: Male-Female Relationships<br></font><p>
When the Twin Cities youth of color started planning for their first show, they realized that before we can deal with the headline-making problems of today, we needed to first talk about how we deal with each other as mothers men and women.   Twin Cities record producer Terry Lewis of Flight Tyme Records had an insightful conversation with the Hype crew about his wife and family and what makes for a successful relationship.  After The Poetess' powerful video "Love hurts when it's coming from the fist," councilor Violet Arnold talked with the crew about how men and women can try to solve problems and build better relationships.

The program looks at the kinds of violence faced by pre-teens in their homes and neighborhoods, and young children offer their unique perspective in the issue.  A profile of two grandmothersone Native American and one Hmongoffers them and their wisdom as an often-overlooked solution to the problem of violence among children and teens.

<center><h2>MEN'S TRADITIONAL DANCE</h2></center>
<img src="stills/manregalia.jpg" align=left hspace=10>

This is the oldest form of dance in the Indian culture. The regalia is often thought to represent the animals that the Creator put on the earth. The movements tell of warrior actions-hunting, stalking the game, battling an enemy. The regalia is a very personal expression of creativity and artistry. While there is no prescribed look, several elements might reflect items worn by early warriors: a breast plate made of animal bones or shell for protection against arrows; a neck choker for protection against knives; ankle bells or jingling hooves; or a shield made of hide and decorated with important tribal symbols. Often a traditional dancer will wear a single bustle containing eagle feathers, which are considered sacred to the Indian people. The eagle flies the highest and carries the prayers of the people to the Creator. Eagle feathers are traditionally awarded for feats of bravery or accomplishment.

<center><h2>WOMAN'S TRADITIONAL DANCE</h2></center>
<img src="stills/womtrad.jpg" align=left hspace=10>


Woman's traditional dance requires enormous stamina, concentration and grace. The movements are very focused. Women move their feet in time with the drum keeping them close to the ground. As the drum plays "honor beats," women raise their fans to honor the drum and their male relatives. An important element of women's traditional dance is the regalia. Women's traditional regalia will usually include a fringed shawl held gracefully folded over one arm, an awl and knife case on the belt and a feather (often eagle ) fan. Southern or Oklahoma style women's traditional often feature buckskin or cloth outfits to go with their more overt rhythmic dance movement.  The regalia will feature beautiful beadwork (usually created by the woman dancer) in patterns and colors that reflect tribal and family affiliation.  Dakota patterns, for instance, often are in rainbow colors and geometric in shape, representing the colors and patterns of their homeland on the plains. The Ojibwe or Winnebago ragalia often reflect floral patterns and woodland colors showing the woodland Indian influence.

<center><h2>MEN'S GRASS DANCE</h2></center>
<img src="stills/spindancer.jpg" align=left hspace=10>


Several stories about the beginnings of the grass dance are told. One tells of the grass dance coming from the movements of the early scouts seeking a site. The grass being high in new areas, the scouts would dance in a special way to flatten the grass and make it acceptable for a new camp or meeting site. The grass dance movements also reflect warrior movements such as stalking the game or enemy and fighting the enemy (including one movement representing one of the warrior's legs being staked and unable to move and battling with this leg in a held position). The grass dance is often said to reflect the need for balance in life; each movement that is danced on one side must be repeated by the other side. Some people talk of the grass dance as a gift from the Creator to celebrate joy. There is rich lore surrounding this dance. The regalia for the dance is comprised of long strands of yarn, ribbon or fabric attached to a base outfit to represent grass or in some theories the scalps of enemies. A headdress called a roach is worn. The roach has two feathers attached in such a way that they rock or twirl as the dancer moves. As in all the dances, the dancer must move with the beats of the drum ending with both feet on the ground on the final beat.

<center><h2>WOMEN'S JINGLE DRESS</h2></center>
<img src="stills/jingle.jpg" align=left hspace=10>


This dance has its origins in northern Minnesota and was introduced to the Pan-Indian community by the Ojibwe people. As the story goes, a medicine man's granddaughter was very ill. He had a dream in which a spirit wearing the jingle dress came to him and told him to make one of these dresses and put it on his daughter to cure her. When he awoke, he and his wife proceeded to assemble the dress as described by the spirit of his dream. When finished, they and others brought his granddaughter to the dance hall and she put on the dress. During the first circle around the room, she needed to be carried. During the second circle around the room, she could barely walk and needed the assistance of several women. The third circle around the room she found she could walk without assistance and during the fourth circle around the room, she danced.
The jingle dress is made of a cloth, velvet or leather base adorned with  jingles made out of a shiny metal. Traditionally and still common today, the jingles are made from the lids of snuff cans. These are bent and molded into triangular bell shapes and attached to the dress with ribbon or fabric in a pattern designed by the dancer. It takes between 400 and 700 jingles to make an adult jingle dress. 
<br>
<br>
The dance itself is designed to incorporate the sound of the jingles by allowing them to move; that is, to make them jingle, or be made "happy."  The steps are controlled and do not invlove high kicking or twirls. Often the steps are in a zigzag pattern to reflect the zigzagging involved in the journey of life. Similar to Men's Grass dancing, the feet often do parallel movements. Similar to a Women's Traditional dancer, the Jingle Dress dancer also raises her fan when the "honor beats" are played on the drum. As in all dances, the Jingle Dress dancer must stay in time with the drum beat and stop with both feet on the ground on the final beat.

<center><h2>MEN'S FANCY DANCE</h2></center>
<img src="stills/menfancy.jpg" align=left hspace=10>


One of the more modern dances in the PowWow, Men's Fancy dance is the most strenuous and athletic. To be good at this dance, the dancer must train for stamina and agility. The dance is fast and features jumps and twirling. The regalia is said to represent the rainbow spirits in its bright colors and flying feathers and ribbons. The Men's Fancy dancer typically wears two bustles of bright colored feathers with added ribbon, feather or horse hair hackles and bright arm and head bands repeating the colors and patterns. The dancer also wears a headdress roach trimmed in colored horsehair and featuring two eagle feathers. The roach is designed to keep the feathers either spinning or rocking in movement. It is part of the dance to keep the feathers moving constantly throughout the song. Dancers also carry coup sticks which are highly decorated with ribbons or feathers. The coup stick was originally a small stick carried into battle by a warrior. It was considered a great sign of bravery if you were able to touch your enemy with your coup stick (much more brave than killing your enemy).

<center><img src="stills/powlogosmaller.jpg"></center>
<center><h2>WOMEN'S FANCY SHAWL DANCE</h2></center>
<img src="stills/womfancy.jpg" align=left hspace=10>


This is the most modern of the women's dances. Some say it was originally called the blanket dance and women danced with a blanket or shawl covering their heads. It was called Graceful Shawl dance in the '60s and the dance steps were closer to the ground and smaller than what is performed today. This is an extremely athletic and strenuous dance involving kicks and twirls and fast movement. It parallels the Men's Fancy Bustle dance in speed and style. Women dance with beautifully decorated shawls often with long ribbon or fabric fringe. The regalia of this dance also includes beaded high moccasins. The symbols and colors beaded on the moccasins have tribal and or personal significance to the dancer.

<h2>Community<br>
</h2></center>
<br>
The Powwow is a gathering that reinforces the values of working together as a family and bonding as a community.  Powwows are places where young people are exposed to the language, values and teachings of the elders and community.
<br><br>
These sentiments are illustrated in the words of Mike Hotaine, a Master of Ceremonies and Dakota person from Manitoba: "Ochiapo means come and help each other.  Come let's do it together.  Hokahey ochiapo, [means] to give each other strength, to give each other words of encouragement...gratefulness for you to be here, and gratefulness that we met today and talked, and that's what the Powwow's about.  It's a celebration of people coming together to share and communicate.  No matter what part of Mother Earth you're on, that part of land is relative, and whoever walks on it is your friend, your 'koda.'  That's how we look at it.  When we come to a celebration, a Powwow, it's like a bunch of birds coming together to communicate, to talk about things, about life.  It's about a new beginning that we will create for each other, for two people, and then we will fly away.  And that's exactly what will happen here.  
We come together this weekend, and after it's finished we'll be going home in our directions and the Powwow will be finished.  And we will go home feeling a different beginning, a different beginning that's happened."

<h2>Spirituality<br>
</h2></center>
<br>
In much of Native American life, the secular and sacred are intertwined: A Powwow is a fun social event and family reunion, while at the same time it provides a setting for spiritual enrichment through traditional rituals and individual reflection.  Dancing, as a form of personal expression, cultural identity, physical enjoyment and worship, embodies this duality of purpose at Powwow.  Another aspect of Native American spirituality is the belief that all elements of the world- the sky, the grass, the rocks, the animals, the wind, the sounds, the people - are relatives, and are to be recognized and treated with appropriate respect.  Worshipping, singing, dancing and helping others are all means of spiritual participation by which the Indians unite with these elements and with each other.
<br><br>
LITEFOOT, a Cherokee rap singer and actor from Oklahoma, feels that "If we have Indian problems and we have Indian questions, we cannot find Indian answers in mainstream society. We have to look to our Indian ways.  I think it would have to be re-establishing that walk with our creator. I mean, we are a praying people."<br><br>

Barbara Feezor-Stewart, an Yankton Sioux Dakota and Anthropologist:  "As I sit here and the wind goes by, I realize that God is here, that Wakantanka is here to make this wind blow, to make my mouth move and the sound waves that go. The spirituality of American Indians is intertwined in everyday life."<br><br>

Walter LaBatt, a Sisseton Wahpeton Dakota traditional dancer, drum maker and artist, says. "We are the original people here, and we have tried to hold on to those good ways, because those good ways have to survive for thousands and thousands of years. Our way is not better, it just works for us."

<h2>Giveaway<br>
</h2></center>
<br>

Powwows serve not only as outlets for creative and spiritual 
expression, but also as forums to present the public rituals of 
honoring and connecting.  To the American Indian people, 
community and family are very important, and thus publicly 
acknowledging accomplishments or virtue is an integral part of 
gatherings.  One ritual for honoring is called the Giveaway. <br><br>

The way in which a community honors its members is an important 
illustration of the values and identity of that culture.  The 
mainstream American community values independence.  Members of 
that community are honored for their accomplishments by being 
singled out and awarded with a gift or presentation.  (A valued 
longtime employee might be given a gold watch; a scientist might be 
awarded a Nobel prize).  In contrast, the American Indian 
community values interdependence and someone is honored by a 
public ceremony in which gifts are given in their name to the people 
who have been important in their lives or somehow have helped 
them reach their accomplishment.  For instance, a teenage boy graduating from high school is honored by gifts given in his name by his mother to the friends and relatives who supported him through the years.  He is singled out as an honored person and those people important in his life are thanked for their involvement and years of help and support.  This approach highlights the values of bonding and working together in a community.  One is reminded that he or she is not alone in life, that people will help in the hard times and provide acknowledgment in the good times. 
<br><br>
Some honorings involve the singing of a special song in memory or in 
honor of a person.  The participants enter the circle and shake the 
hands of the honored individual and his or her family.  As a group 
they complete the circle around the arena, and then the song is 
begun. More often, however, gifts given in an honoring include beautiful blankets or quilts, handmade dance outfits, jackets, ribbon shirts or money.  Sometimes fruit or candy is used in giveaways for children.  Sometimes a cow or horse will be given as a special honoring.

<head><TITLE>PowWow: Snagging</TITLE></head>
<body bgcolor=ffffff>

<center><img src="../stills/wacpowlog.jpg"></center>
<center><h2>SNAGGING</h2></center><br>

The Powwow is a gathering of people from all over North America.  It is a great place to meet people sharing a common heritage, value system, and interests.  It's also a great place to make new friends, and that includes romantic partners.  
<br><br>
Buddy Whipple, a Mdewakanton Dakota man, explains the historical basis for such gatherings.  "You could not marry someone from your own tribe, or your own band, especially your own clan.  So what you had to do was to go someplace else and get a wife (or husband).  This is the way you found someone that was not of your own tribe."
<br>
Leon Thompson, a Yakama Nez perce Fancy dancer adds that "that's what the Powwow is all about--meeting new people and meeting old friends, and one other term called "snagging", you know, boy meets girl and stuff like that.  They call that snagging.  The announcer says 'Don't be snaggin," or "let her go or let him go...That's how I met my wife on the Powwow trail in Eagle Butte, South Dakota.  We just met and ended up going to the same school."
<br>
A similar story is recalled by Harvey and Tania Goodsky of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe: "Nine years ago we met at a Powwow.  We just started out as friends, we hung around together, and that's all we were, just friends.  We walked around and talked, and I guess it just snuck up on me one day, I guess.  That's how I can explain it."

<h2>Sobriety<br>
</h2></center>
<br>

Powwows are sober events.  No drugs or alcohol are allowed on the premises.  
<br><br>
Acoording to Kenny Merrick, a Master of Ceremonies and member of the Devil's Lake Sioux Tribe, "A Powwow is a place where one learns to find within themselves who they really are.  This is very sacred to us, the circle.  And this is why we don't like to see alcohol or drugs involved in the Powwow."
<br><br>
 Christina Gail, an Objibwe Jingle Dress Dacner from White Earth further explains that  "My namesake told me, he said, when Indians drink and drug, they drive their spirits away.  That spirit doesn't want to be around alcohol and drugs, so it goes away.  And that's why people walk around lost." 
<br><br>
 Ed Godfrey, a Dakota/Lakota person and director of the Juel Fairbank Chemical Dependency services in St. Paul, says "The getting high from being out there dancing to a good traditional song, you know that feeling that you have, is a true type of feeling that's an experience for you that isn't artificially induced."
<br><br>
In contemporary society, alcohol use is problematic in the American Indian community. However, alcohol was not a substance used in early Native American communities.  It was introduced to the Indian people a little over 200 years ago by the white settlers, most notably the traveling mountain men and fur traders. Many people feel that it is an unnatural substance for Indian people and that there may be a predisposition to addiction.  Alcohol and drug addiction is a complicated situation. One needs to look at a physical cause, an emotional cause, social circumstances and the occurence of a spiritual loss.  The appearance of white settlers in Native American territory, set forth a chain of events

Since itAlcohol addiction, introduced to the Indian nations only , has quickly weakened the fabric of a community that for tens of thousands of years was able to maintain balance.  Powwow does the exact opposite of what drugs and alcohol do to a community.  The Powwow highlights the balance of the community and brings people together with a physical, spiritual and communal connection.  Perhaps one of the most interesting views is the role of Powwow and traditional ways as an element in recovery. 
<br><br>
 Buddy Whipple, a Mdewakanton Dakota man and member of the board of directors for Juels Fairbank Chemical Dependency services, told his story.  "I'd go to Powwows, and I'd feel it.  I can't describe it.  It's just a feeling I had, that I wanted to dance, and I wanted to be out there, and it made me feel good.  One of the things is that coming back from overseas and out of the Marine Corps I really abused alcohol.  To me, a weekend just meant drinking.  I got off work, went down to the bar, cashed my check, and of course I'd spend half my check there at the bar.  Going to Powwows, it was a sober event, and the more I went to Powwows the more I liked it.  I let go of the alcohol and drug abuse by gong to Powwows.  And that's why I've always been real thankful that I found my way back. 
<br><br>
For many people revisiting traditional ways has been an important tool.  Ed Godfrey feels that it is no coincidence that alcohol is called "spirits" and used to fill up a "spiritual hole".  Finding a healthy sense of self and community can greatly help recovering people.  Powwows naturally provide such opportunities.  Here is a place where it is safe and encouraged to be an Indian person, where the traditional and modern ways and values intermingle and American Indian people can celebrate their identity openly with pride.  
<br><br>
Walter LaBatt, a Sisseton Wahpeton Dakota dancer, drum maker and artist explains his story.  "When I used to go to Powwows, I used to drink and ...thought I had a good time.  But I would see some of those Powwow people, how their lives had changed through going the traditional way.  I used to feel somewhat, well, damn envious, because they could enjoy themselves and have a good time- you could see them dancing and having fun- without having to go that alcohol way.  Without having to put something in your body to feel good.   At first initially, I thought, well I'll just sober up and I'll be satisfied that way.  But there was something lacking, something lacking inside.  Sobriety made me feel good, but there was something lacking, and I didn't quite know what it was.  I don't know.  Luckily I stumbled and found the right way."

<h2>Veterans<br>
</h2></center>
<br>

Native American people who served in the United States armed services are greatly honored in the American Indian community.  The translation for soldier, warrior, protector and helper are all the same word.  In Dakota that word is Akicita and in Ojibwe it is Ogichida. 
<br><br>
As Ed Godfrey, a Dakota/Lakota veteran explains, "It was always the warrior who was first in defending Mother Earth.  It was his duty to be first.  It is a part of traditional values, a part of protecting against any outside invasion that would endanger the people, our people and the land."  
<br><br>
It is a remarkable fact that Indian people served the United States long before they were even given United States citizenship.  In fact, between 1917 and 1918, over 10,000 American Indian people enlisted into the armed services to serve in World War I.  Although this was the greatest number of enlisted peoples from any one non-anglo culture, citizenship (with the right to vote) for Native Americans was not granted until 1924.
<br><br>
The warrior is seen as having an important and ongoing role.  As Chief Ernest Wabasha, hereditary chief of the Dakota people, explains. "Sometime in the future we believe that we will be back to protect the environment and everything else."<br><br>

<CENTER><H2>The Chrysler "Hoop Dreams" Challenge</H2></CENTER><BR>
<BR>

Through a generous grant from the Chrysler Corporation, <B>Hoop Dreams</B>  will make its television debut on PBS.  The broadcast will be followed by <B>A Hoop Dreams Reunion</B>,  a 30-minute update that will include never-before-seen footage of William Gates and Arthur Agee, and their families, in addition to exclusive interviews with the filmmakers.<BR>
<BR>
Accompanying the PBS broadcasts of <B>Hoop Dreams</B>,  will be the <B>Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge</B>, a community educational outreach campaign.  The campaign, funded by Chrysler Corporation, will be conducted by KTCA-TV in St. Paul, MN, and the Center for the Study of Sport in Society (CSSS) at Northeastern University in Boston.<BR>
<BR>
Twenty major cities including Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Houston, Chicago, and Miami will be targeted to bring national exposure to issues confronted in the film.  PBS stations will partner with the National Consortium for Academics and Sport (NCAS) and ethnically diverse national and grassroots organizations to motivate young people in establishing and pursuing positive goals.<BR>
<BR>
KTCA and CSSS will create and distribute resource and training materials to schools and communities.   The outreach project is a multi-dimensional campaign designed to educate children, parents, communities and the public about the many complex issues raised by <B>Hoop Dreams</B>.  Issues include the importance of education and self motivation; the role of sports in inner-city communities; familial conflict and support; teen and single parenting; drugs and violence; and the educational system's role and responsibility in recruiting young athletes.<BR>
<BR>
Highlights of the Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge  are:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI> The printing of 500,000 student playbooks and 34,000 teacher guides.

<LI> The Philadelphia school system has committed to making the <B>Hoop Dreams</B>  materials a required curriculum unit in 83 middle and high schools!
</UL><BR>


Events that are occurring across the country include:
<UL><LI> A statewide interactive teleconference in Georgia.
<LI> A breakfast event for 200 community leaders in Detroit.
<LI> A luncheon event and screening for 125 community leaders in Los Angeles.
<LI> Arthur and William appearing on a panel for 800 high school leaders in Washington, D.C.
</UL><BR>

In many cities, the professional and university basketball teams are partnering with the public television stations to promote Hoop Dreams  and to provide players as speakers in classrooms.

<BLOCKQUOTE>"One of the purposes of the extensive outreach is to get the film to members of African-American and Latino communities that don't traditionally watch PBS," said Catherine Allan, co-executive producer for <B>Hoop Dreams</B>.  "We want to get communities to use the film as a tool of empowerment -- to empower youth", she added.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Additionally, PBS has retained the rights to broadcast the documentary five more times over the next three years.  By providing educators with the option to videotape and use the film for up to one year after each broadcast, outreach efforts can continue long after the initial telecast on November 15th!

<H1>D<FONT SIZE=5>ear</FONT> D<FONT SIZE=5>iscussion</FONT> L<FONT 
SIZE=5>eader,</FONT> </H1>
<P>
Thank you for taking part in the <B>Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge</B>!
<P>
<B>Hoop Dreams</B> is a film that extends beyond the blacktops and gyms into the hearts of America's youth.  <B>Hoop Dreams</B> is the story not only of William Gates and Arthur Agee, but also of thousands of kids confronting their own pressures, choices, and challenges.
<P>
The purpose of the <B>Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge</B> is to use the PBS Premiere of <B>Hoop Dreams</B> as a catalyst for discussing important social issues, accepting personal responsibility, and challenging youth and their families to pursue success in life through a well-balanced education.
<P>
<B>Hoop Dreams</B> is both a documentary film and a major motion picture.  However, young people and others often found it difficult to find the movie in a theater near them.  Now, thanks to the Chrysler Corporation and PBS, <B>Hoop Dreams</B> can finally be viewed by all.  You have the right to tape the show from the PBS premiere on November 15, 1995, and to show it to young people for one year.
<P>
<B>Hoop Dreams</B> tells a uniquely American story  where myth, hope, and reality collide.  While not denying the difficulties of urban life, the film  and this outreach program  take viewers past the stereotypes where most media would stop.  We hope that this program provides you with a unique opportunity to reach young people on topics that are otherwise difficult to discuss.<P>

The Hoop Dreams Playbook is created primarily for young people (ages 12-18) who live and go to school in the urban environment.  However, it has also proven effective with a wide age-range of young women and men of all races from suburban, urban, and rural areas.<P>

The Playbook is designed to be used in a group setting, guided by the discussion leader.  The Playbook organizes the film's themes into two main areas: 1) Educational Success and 2) Personal Responsibility.   Whether you are teaching young people in a classroom or a community agency, the suggestions in this Discussion Guide will prove valuable.<P>

Keep in mind, however, that The Playbook can be only as effective as its discussion leader!  Be creative!  Invite guest speakers who are experts in specific discussion segments (e.  g.  Drugs, Educational Success, Teenage Pregnancy).  Refer to specific moments in the film that illustrate important points.  <B>Your</B> enthusiasm and knowledge of the young people in your group are crucial to the impact of both <B>Hoop Dreams</B> and this outreach program.<P>

Once again, we thank you for participating in the <B>Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge</B>.  We hope that this program will be both memorable and meaningful to you and your students.<br clear=all>

<CENTER><H1>Who's Who in Hoop Dreams</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><HR size=5 width=400></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5><B>Arthur Agee</B></FONT> <P>


Arthur entered St. Joseph's High School with a partial scholarship.  When his family had financial problems and could no longer pay tuition, he was forced to transfer to an inner-city public school.  A star at Marshall High School, Arthur led his team to the state semi-finals during his senior year.  In high school, Arthur virtually ignored his academic preparations for college.  He graduated from Mineral Area Junior College and attended Arkansas State University.  Arthur recently played professional basketball in the United States Basketball League.  He is now working to complete his college degree.  Arthur recently formed The Arthur Agee Role Model Foundation.<P>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Sheila Agee</B></FONT><BR>
  
<FONT SIZE=2>Arthur's mother</FONT><P>


Mrs. Agee worked hard to keep her family together while pursuing her own dreams.  She studied at Bethel Employment Services to be a nurse's aide, and she graduated first in her class.  Mrs. Agee now works as a nursing assistant and plans to continue her medical education.<P>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Bo Agee</B></FONT>  <BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Arthur's father</FONT><P>

Mr. Agee's problems with drugs were a constant struggle in the film.  Although Mr. Agee was focused on Arthur's NBA dream, he was not always there for Arthur in his other life needs.  Having recently overcome the challenges of drug addiction and unemployment, Mr. Agee is now a motivational speaker to young people in and around Chicago.<P>
<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5><B>William Gates</B></FONT><P>


William was recruited to St. Joseph's High School as the &quot;next Isiah Thomas.&quot;  For four years he coped with the constant pressure and responsibilities of being &quot;the star.&quot;  While becoming a High School All-American, William also met his academic responsibilities.  Despite entering high school on a 5th grade reading level, he made the honor roll in 11th grade.  William played basketball at Marquette University for three years, including the 1994-95 NIT finalist team.  He is on pace to graduate from Marquette in the fall of 1995.  William recently started the Hoop Dreams Foundation, a non-profit organization designed to help young people.<P>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5><B>Emma Gates</B></FONT>  <BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>William's mother</FONT><P>


Mrs. Gates worked hard to protect her children from the dangers of the neighborhood.  Emma instilled in William the importance of balancing academics and sports.  Having each of her children succeed in school was very important to her.<P>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5><B>Curtis Gates</B>  </FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>William's brother</FONT><P>


Curtis was a high school star and the Colby Community College basketball &quot;Player of the Decade.&quot; After his hoop dreams faded, he invested in William's basketball career.  Curtis currently works for Federal Express in Chicago.<P>
<BR>


<FONT SIZE=5><B>Catherine Gates</B></FONT> <BR>
 
<FONT SIZE=2>William's wife</FONT><P>


Catherine and William have two children.  A member of the swimming team at Westinghouse High School, Catherine graduated sixth in her class.  Catherine is in the process of obtaining her college degree while raising her children.<P>

LEADER'S NOTES: In some ways, both were right.  Even if he had not played basketball, colleges would still have accepted William since he was an honor student.   It is not clear how William and his family could have paid for college without his athletic scholarship.<P>

We have just completed making our transportable Ku-band uplink fully redundant.  Our transportable dish is a 2 port Andrew 2.4 meter offset G/Tesa w/APC-100 antenna controller.  It is pulled by a 3/4 ton Chevrolet/GMC Suburban.  Arrangements can be made for editing if needed.
<P>

Whether it is breaking news or a planned shoot, when you have need for a live or taped event from the Minnesota State Capitol, KTCA-TV offers an  immediate path out.  KTCA-TV is the only Twin Cities television station to have dedicated fiber from the Minnesota State Capitol, along with dedicated telephone lines.   Fiber conductivity is available in both the House and Senate Galleries as well as the B-12 press offices.  Other areas of the building are accessible with a cable run.
<P>

With the crunch on finding available satellite space, perhaps you prefer shipping your transmissions via Vyvx.  Through the Vyvx network, your signal can be routed practically anywhere in the U.S.  KTCA via Teleport Minnesota can hook into the Vyvx network, we have fiber to both send and receive.

<P>

We are Studio 2 Productions, a division of KTCA television, located in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota.  Call us the next time you need a path out of the Twin Cities.

<h2>Bring Warm Clothes</h2>

Bring Warm Clothes is a one hour history documentary based on the material compiled in Peg Meier's popular book of the same name.  The documentary (and the book) is a collection of letters, diary entries and newspaper articles that give a personal side to life in Minnesota from the early 1800s thru 1932.  We will be blending evocative re-creations with the original letters and historic photographs.<p>

Principal photography for the doc took place on appropriately chilly days in November and December.  Locations include the historic Kelly Farm in ELk River, The Ramsey house in St. Paul, the Scandia Luther church in Scandia, Murphy's Landing in Shakopee and Fort Snelling.<p>

Tentative airdate for Bring Warm Clothes is March 5, 1996
<hr>
<h2>The Dakota Exile</h2>

The Dakota Exile will be a sequel to KTCA's earlier special The Dakota Conflict. The Dakota Exile will follow the paths of the Dakota people after the Conflict of 1862. From imprisonment and the initial reservation life to the suppression of native spirituality and the boarding school experience, The Dakota Exile will tell the story of those who were removed from their homeland and those who risked everything to come back. The documentary will be one-hour long and is tentatively scheduled to air in early 1996.
<p>
The Dakota Exile will be funded by The St. Paul Companies.
<hr>

<h2>Givens Collection Documentary</h2>
An hour documentary on how black culture has changed the American character. Inspired by the Givens Collection, Minnesota's premiere collection about black life and literature. The show will be produced and directed by Daniel Pierce Bergin.  (Final program title TBA)
