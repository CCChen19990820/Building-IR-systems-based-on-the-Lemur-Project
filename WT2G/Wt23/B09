Steve,

Want to thank you for the excellent job you do with
Pipes Digest, and would like some advice.

About 9 months ago I bought a Peterson's Captain
Pete pre-carbonized bowl.  I've had great luck with
Peterson's, but unfortunately this pipe just doesn't
smoke well.  It has a terrible smoke the first half of
the bowl (it produces a lot of moisture), and then
eventually settles down to an OK (read: Not great)
smoke.  I don't know if the stain used has any
bearing, but every time I finish this pipe there is
always a distinct tinge of red varnish on my hand. 
(My own theory is that the varnish they used to stain
the exterior was used excessively, and was
actually soaked into the interior of the bowl.)

At the advice of a local tobacconist I treated it with
a commercial pipe sweetener, which slightly
improved the taste, although not enough for me to
really want to smoke this pipe.

Do you have any suggestions on treating this pipe
?  Also, is a reputable manufacturer like Peterson
willing to refund/replace this pipe, since obviously
there is either a defect in the briar or in the
manufacturer?

Phil Valenti
????????@???.?????.????.???

[ I think that K&amp;P should at least be willing to let you trade it for
a pipe of equal value; if the stain is coming off in your hand, it's
clearly defective.  Please let us know if they don't. -S. ]

<a name="4">Subject: Pipes and Cigars in Phoenix</a>

Steve,
  I have responded to directly to the gentleman who inquired about pipe stores 
in Phoenix. However your "guide" is dire need of additions. Having smoked a 
pipe for 30 years, lived in Phoenix for the last 20 years, and smoked cigars 
for the last 10 years, perhaps I'm qualified to offer a supplement? 
  Churchills is cigars only.They carry a good selection of high end cigars and 
humidors. Their employees, though generally in their 20's seem relatively well 
educated regarding cigars.In addition they have a "backroom" with tv, stereo, 
leather chairs, persian rugs and other comforts for a rather pricey annual 
membership fee.
   Stag Tocacconists is a chain located in 5 different malls in the Phoenix 
area.As with most chains, they have a huge selection of gifts and trinkets, a 
predictable cigar selection and mainly low to medium grade pipes. I've been to 
each location and have found that employees vary in their knowledge of pipes 
and/or cigars.
  Ford &amp; Haig (602 946-0608)is a pipe and cigar establishment located in the 
elite shopping area of downtown Scottsdale. They have a nice selection of high 
end cigars, a few trinkets and a few high end pipes. 
  Village Smoke Shop (602 314-9898)is a relatively new establishment, but has 
great promise. Their cigar stock is growing, as is their pipe collection. The 
owner, Craig Cooper, is a magician when it comes to renovating estate pipes, 
and offers a nice selection of varying grades of these pipes. I particularly 
enjoy the couch and large chairs available for FREE. The atmosphere of the 
place invites you to sit down, have a smoke, kibitiz, or read one of his many 
interesting and current magazines.
  Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco Shop (602 955-7740) is a father-son operation 
that's been around for years. Rick Hopkins maintains a large and varied 
selection of cigars, pipes (new and estate) and RELEVANT smoking accessories. 
He and his employees are extremely knowledgable on all aspects of smoking and 
tobacco, and take great delight in teaching rookie smokers the art of pipes 
and/or cigars.
  Knight Gallery, located in the Paradise Valley Mall, is a small store with a 
large selection of gift and do-dads, and a limited selection of pipes, cigars 
and smoking accessories.
  The other "pipe shops" I've explored are what may be termed head shops. They 
deal in incense, adult videos, posters, small metal, wood and glass pipes. I 
don't claim that this listing is complete, and certainly welcome any 
information on legitimate pipe stores I may have overlooked.I offer these 
places as simply a supplement to your current directory of information.
  Before I sign off, I've been reading PD for several months now and have not 
noticed another female pipe smoker in your list of members, or in any of your 
letters or articles. Surely I can't be the only one? 
  Thanks for your efforts in providing such enjoyable and regular reading on 
the subject of pipes and tobacco! Best wishes for a happy holiday season!

  Joyce Perry

[ Many thanks for the additions, Joyce!  If you could also supply me
with the addresses, I'll add them to the Guide (which, BTW, is not
meant to be authoritative; it's just a collection of stuff I've gotten
from members over the years.)

And indeed, you aren't the only female pipe smoker on the list;
Gabrielle Sempf (and others) are members.  Perhaps some of the women
on the list should pipe up? -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #206 -- December 20, 1995</a>

Dear Steve: At the outset happy holidays to you and Jean. I have just
finished reading #206 and have two short comments. (1) regarding Andrew
Donovan-Shead's lengthy posting - WHY? and (2) it seems to me that the time
has come to seriously consider splitting off the cigar content. On this
latter point I recognize that many readers smoke both, but having to access
two seperate Digests would no doubt double these readers' enjoyment!
Regards, Bob Holmes.

[ Regarding (1), Andrew asked permission to submit "Scramble" before
he did so.  I thought that an original story, to be read aloud on
Christmas night, was a nice thought for the Christmas issue.  I
therefore agreed, with the proviso that he provide search targets for
skipping around the article (which he did.)  Every submission I've
received from Andrew has been, IMHO, worth reading.  "Scramble" was no
exception.

Regarding (2), my policy is, and remains, thus: if anyone else wants
to start and moderate a Cigar Digest, they will have my support.
However, I only have the time to moderate one mailgroup, and (#include
&lt;executive-capacity.h&gt;) the Pipes Digest will remain all-inclusive. -S. ]

Good day all,

About Chillies
If I remember correctly a short time ago there was a  
question about smoking chillie in yer pipe, &lt;no rearly I  
don't think I've gone mad&gt;  I had thought about the idea  
and I do have a taste for chillie's, but is this wise, could  
some kind of toxic shock ensue?  I've heard that the  
chemical which so distinguishes chillie is similar to that  
used in sprays designed to incapacitate. 

About Alcohol
Personally I have enjoyed a measure or two of Rum with  
a pipe, very mellow indeed.  Ports are pleasant and go  
down very well for me; I s'pose the only rule of thumb I  
follow is that in general assuming it's been treated with  
care and consideration; like your pipe the older the  
better. &lt;not much help there then&gt;.  Soon I plan on  
experimenting with a glass or two of Wild Turkey, so  
who knows maybe I'll recommend that as well as Rum.

About Youth
I don't smoke much in public places; generally I'm at  
home or a friends house, but I find that there is a real  
perception that Old men smoke pipes; the very idea of  
someone of my age, say 24 smoking a pipe is difficult  
for many to take in, it's not so much that people wonder  
what substance I might be smoking, but rather they find  
it hard to comprehend why I would wish to take part in an  
old mans past time.  I find all this very odd indeed,  
because for me pipe smoking is associated with Jeremy  
Bretts Sherlock Holms or those interesting scientists  
from the fifties who could achieve anything with rays,  
rocket fuel or atomic pwer :)  Then there is always the  
bumbling and pleasent absent minded academic or the  
honest chap from Lancashire who has a passion for  
engineering?  Yes Stereotypes all, but they provide me  
with a helluva lot of sustinance.

Well I'll be off and wish you a merry christmas and all  
that,

Have a good one!

<a name="7">Subject: Splitting the digest</a>

Hi Steve and all the others,

I've been away for some time, believe it or not mostly due to my 
disfunctioning HP-Deskjet. I always print the digest, there's nothing 
like paper when it comes to reading.

As I read in pd206 there are plans for splitting up the Cigar and 
Pipes part of the digest. I would be very diapointed if this where to 
happen. 
I am a pipesmoker and every now and then I do smoke a cigar. The 
digest informs me both on the pipes and cigars. If it wasn't for the 
digest I would still be smoking crap in case of cigars.
I wouldn't subscribe to a cigars only list but I thoroughly enjoy the 
digest as it is. Please keep it that way. Besides I think the cigar 
enthousiasts are lucky with you as a moderator of this combined list 
(if I am right that you would continue the pipes part of the splitted 
digest)

Okay that's it for now and a Happy New Year to all!

P.S. What Steve has joined Thou shalt not part! ;-)

<a name="9">Subject: Condor and Me</a>

Hi! Steve,

It's a pleasure receiving Pipe Digest; I can almost forgive Gallaher's
unfortunate stance for my deciding to explore the web for pipe &amp; tobacco
information and coming across the Digest.

Anyway, a warm thanks for everyone who's given information about obtaining
Condor (and to you for putting my original e's to you in the Digest), and
what follows is my little history of how I became hooked on Condor as my
favorite tobacco:

-------------------------------------------------------

The first time I had tried Gallaher's Condor was back in 1974. My wife and I
were going to have a relax on the Windermere ferry and were boarding by
Ambleside (in the Lake District, England, which is a whole other story) when
I realized that while having a pipe, I forgot to take any tobacco with me.

There was a small shop outside the ferry, we went into it, and I asked a
young shopkeeper whether he had any tobacco. He gave me a long and
enthusiastic description of which I didn't really understand. But I had
recognized the word "Condor" and repeated it. (I can't remember, though, if
I had first purchased the long cut or the ready rubbed.)

Opening the packet, I was impressed with its deep, rich aroma, quite unlike
any other tobacco I had tried, and at the time I used to experiment with
just about anything (having taken up pipe smoking several months before). To
this day, I'm still struck by its aroma each time I open a new packet.

It also smoked wonderfully: a long, cool smoke which reduced to a fine white
ash. Also, in the days when it was okay to smoke a pipe in restaurants, if I
was smoking Condor, inevitably someone would come up to compliment the aroma.

Mind you, I make no claim about being a tobacco expert; I'm simply
discussing personal preference.

I picked up a supply from duty free that year, and back in New York City, I
used to wander about tobacco shops looking for it. And I eventually found a
shop that sold it, but it went out of business a year later.

About the same time I met a Pam Am worker who often returned to Bristol; he
used to bring back some Condor each trip. (And that's when I learned how to
ration it--to a couple of smokes in the evening.)

In returning to the Lake District (many times), I had a number of Condor
discussions. One friend, an ex-fireman from Newcastle, told me that the
entire department smoked nothing else. He also told me that a work crew just
about went on strike when the local shop ran out of Condor. (Note for anyone
in the U.S.: It is *very* popular in the U.K.)

Later I found out that I could order it from Arnold's Tobacco, in New York
City. And one day I received a JR catalog, in which I saw it was nearly half
the price. I suppose that was my downfall: I became a full-time Condor smoker!

So the recent Gallaher decision about not wanting to put a WARNING label as
required for U.S. distribution at the retail level has hit very hard indeed.
(I'm still waiting for steak knives and barbecues to carry similar warnings.)

I have followed up on everyone's suggestions and have written, telephoned,
faxed, and e-mailed various tobacconists. Christmas is not the best time to
get attention though; however, a friend of a friend who is visiting said
he'd bring over a supply. I figure the worst that could happen is that I
wind up in Condor heaven, but I usually store surplus tobacco in the frig.
And, of course, at best I'll have a good supply and a splendid way to break
in some pipes by Mark Tinsky.

Happy Holidays Steve, Jean and fellow (and lady) PD'rs. Thought y'all might 
be amused by this bit of trivia. Prior to the mid-1800's, New York City was a 
principal grower of fine tobacco. Then the cost of land made farming totally 
unprofitable. Only after the War Between the States did tobacco growing gain 
hold in Virginia and the Carolinas. My great-great grandfather had a farm 
where Radio City Music Hall now stands but have no idea of his crop(s).

     Thank you very much for the Cigar Club membership.  I am from

     I am enjoying the change of culture and atmosphere.  However, 
     Cajuns of Lafayette, (the Cajun capital of the World) enjoy a 
     similar disposition to the friendly, laid back nature of the 
     Emirates.
     
     Cuban cigars are plentiful here.  However, they are as in other 
     places, quite pricy. I can't imagine too many Cubans enjoying the 
     fruits of their own country!!  Not at 4 to 5 dollars a piece!  
     
     I thank you for the extensive listing of vendors in you mail out.  
     I will contact some who have email addresses, to mail order some 
     good Mexican or Honduran cigars, to keep me company under the 
     beautiful Arabian sky.
     
     We do not have FTP or HTTP access.  Please could I have a copy of

<a name="13">Subject: Response to Clean Air</a>

     This is in response to David Taylor's (????????????@???.???) note 
     from cccccccold Minnesota. 
     
     I live in southeastern Michigan and have been a cigar smoker for 
     several years now. Up until a few weeks ago, I used to sit in my 
     garage and TRY to enjoy my smokes. My wife and I both felt that 
     cigar smoke was NOT the first thing that a person should smell upon 
     entering a house. We also did not have an acceptable solution, so I 
     continued to use a space heater along with a 13 inch television (I 
     actually had cable to my garage too!). It's very difficult to enjoy 
     one's favorite cigar in the frigid winter months when there's heat 
     blasting towards you and cold creeping up your back.
     
     During the last week of November, my wife mentioned that I could 
     try to smoke in the house if I confined it to one room. The 
     stipulation was that if we could not control the odor, I would 
     (again!) be confined to the garage. I was determined to make this 
     work and here is how I (mostly) succeeded...
     
     I chose our bedroom because the scent of a good cigar (have I heard 
     that line before?!) does not bother my wife and we are the only two 
     that frequent that part of the house. Our bedroom is on the second 
     floor and, like most, has a door that I keep closed when I indulge. 
     I also bought an air purifier which is running on low constantly. 
     Make sure you purchase one that is quiet when it is on as they must 
     run for extended periods of time to be effective. I also keep our 
     closets closed and keep the door to the bathroom closed. This 
     minimizes the potential for the smell to permeate into any fabric 
     (clothes, towels, etc.). My last recommendation is to purchase one 
     of those scented candles. I did not buy one of the special, 
     cigar-smoke-eliminating candles. I just bought a cherry-scented 
     candle that came in a jar. I light the candle, shut the doors and 
     have been enjoying my favorite smokes for about a month now. 
     Indoors!!!
     
     If you follow all of the above (and maybe open a window in your 
     smoking room occasionally) you will minimize the cigar odor. You 
     will at least confine it to one room which I feel is a good 
     compromise. This method has worked for us and the added benefit is 
     that my wife and I are able to be together while I smoke (instead 
     of me shivering in the garage while she is (doing whatever) in the 
     house). What little odor is left in the room does not bother her. 
     
     This was the nicest Christmas present that I could ever hope to 
     receive. Thanks dear! 
     
     I hope that some of you will get the opportunity to try this out 
     and are as successful as I was. Good Luck and Happy Smoking!

Steve,
 
Congratulations on a fine end-of-the-year Digest, and thank you for the
Ohio Pipe Collector plugs.  The OPC now stands at 105 members from 15
states and 4 foreign countries.  We did well enough off our swap/sell show
in Sept. that the 26-page newsletter I just sent out did not quite bankrupt
us.  (My wife says I'm out of the newsletter business and in the magazine
business now).  I'll have to restrain myself a bit in the future, but, as
always, we continue to recruit new members at our low dues rate of $12 per
year.  Anyone who seriously thinks they might like to be a member can send
me their address for a comp copy of the newsletter.
 
Now, for the enjoyment of all your pipe-smoking subscribers, I'd like to
share with you the third in my series on Ohio pipe makers, reprinted from
the Dec., 1995, issue of the OPC newsletter.
 
OHIO PIPE MAKERS: TIM WEST
 
The Artisan
 
I met with Tim West on a cold November afternoon during his lunch hour at
his suburban home in northwest Columbus.  He lives there with his wife,
Carla, an RN on the orthopedic ward at Riverside Hospital, and three
school-age children; a fourth child is grown and out of the house.  The
pre-Christmas season is a busy time for Tim, and he was engaged in shipping
pipes to the 35 retail outlets that carry them.  Tim and I settled onto a
living room couch, and I set up my tape recorder on a coffee table.  But I
had to be careful to keep my mind on the interview and off the dozens and
dozens of large and extremely tempting pipes (I wanted to hold and fondle
all of them) that were spread across the floor and piled up on tables and
chairs.
 
Tim's father, who died in 1960 when Tim was 10, was a carpenter who built
and sold custom homes.  The family lived in each new house until the next
one was built and the last one sold.  So Tim's childhood was spent living a
nomadic existence in a succession of brand-new houses around Franklin
County.  But he learned from his father a good sense of tools and
woodworking by accompanying him to job sites and building things out of
scrap wood.
 
When he was 17 and in high school, Tim began smoking a pipe and got
interested in the extensive pipe collection of Charles Ormerod, the father
of a longtime friend.  The collection featured many sculpted and unusually
shaped pipes.  Like most pipe smokers in those days, novice and veteran,
Tim became a regular at Smoker's Haven, with its huge stock of GBDs and
Charatans, where, he says, he "would walk around in awe and drool all over
the cases."
 
But he couldn't afford them, and one day Sid Ritter of Smoker's Haven
offered him a block of wood and a couple of stems and asked if he was good
with his hands.  Having faith in his own competence, Tim took the briar
home, whereupon he caught some kind of bug.  He wasn't very sick, but he
was contagious and couldn't go to school.  So he descended into his
basement and worked on the pipe for a solid week, using only the very basic
workbench hand tools available to him.  The result was a skull's head pipe.
He got lots of compliments for the pipe and proceeded to produce two
more--a human hand holding a bowl and a clown's head with hat serving as a
windscreen.  He made a few more pipes in standard shapes, but then he
entered Ohio State as an art student, started working, got married and
drifted away from pipemaking.  (Tim still has the second and third pipes he
made, but the skull was stolen the first week he moved into Monkey's
Retreat.)
 
And drifted into music as the bassist for the rock band Bootlegg, which was
"fairly popular" around the Ohio State area for about three years, but at
that time there were no good venues in Columbus that highlighted local
bands.  All that changed when the Agora opened in September, 1975--one
month after Bootlegg broke up.  Another local band, McGuffey Lane, whose
music was quite similar to Bootlegg's, went on to become successful.  So,
but for a small timing glitch, we might be talking about Tim West, rock
star, today instead of Tim West, pipe maker.
 
Jobless, bandless and single again in the fall of 1975, Tim went back to
making pipes as a founding member of an artist's collective located in
Monkey's Retreat, an eclectic book and whatever shop still located on North
High St. in Columbus.  He and the other craftsmen soon started going on the
road together to craft shows, and Tim began selling enough pipes to have a
successful little business.  In 1990, the last full year he did shows, Tim
travelled to 25 of them.  Today he is down to just two or three a year.
 
In 1980, Tim opened Tim West Pipes, a retail shop in the Ohio Center near
downtown Columbus.  He closed the shop in 1991 and moved the entire
business to his home workshop to concentrate on wholesaling.  The workshop
takes up most of the basement of his house, but it isn't very big--some
tools, racks of briar blocks, cabinets full of stems and boxes of
half-finished pipes.  To this day, Tim believes that he is much less
mechanized than most pipemakers he knows of.  He does have a top turner and
a frazer, but they're not hooked up, and the top turner is his television
stand.
 
Tim acknowledges that, as a pipemaker, he is entirely self- taught, having
learned through trial and error.  He believes that pipemakers who have had
the chance to study pipemaking or to work with established pipemakers are
lucky because "it just mystified me for years wondering how they did
it--while I was doing it." And though he does use some power equipment
today to drill, shape, sand and buff, everything is still set up, guided
and shaped by hand.
 
When I asked Tim about his philosophy of pipemaking, he laughed for some
time.  We talked further about the changes in his pipemaking over the
years, and he allowed as how, during his first year at Monkey's Retreat, a
good 50 percent of his pipes were sculptured (piano pipes, toilet pipes,
guitar pipes, etc.) because he had lots of time and could take a week to
carve a pipe for someone.  It might be his only sale for a week but would
still provide enough cash to keep him in business.  As his popularity grew,
he needed to make more pipes and thus increasingly produced smooth shapes,
either freehand or standard.
 
Tim has won his share of blue ribbons and various awards, but he doesn't
think much about them and can't remember what they are. He's far more
interested in making pipes and selling them to people who will smoke and
appreciate them, but I should note that he received the best standard shape
award at the 1983 PCI show.
 
Tim works about 40 hours a week making pipes and doing repairs for various
shops around the country.  Recently his father-in- law, Jim Seman, has
begun working with Tim, who says that Jim "is turning into a good
pipemaker."  Tim's free time is spent with family.  He also likes cooking
and does most of the cooking around the house.
 
When I asked Tim if he is as excited now to be making pipes as he was 20
years ago, he didn't hesitate a second answering "oh, yeah."  As for his
own pipe smoking, Tim hasn't smoked anything but his own pipes for years.
He smokes good-quality English blends, heavy on the Latakia, but has no
particular favorite.
 
The Pipes
 
Today, Tim averages about 1,500 pipes a year.  They tend to be medium large
to big, with either a lucite or vulcanite (hard rubber) stem.  He does no
sandblasting, but he does do needlepoint carving on some of the pipes.  He
continues to use the finest Grecian briar that he can obtain, although he
notes that some good-looking briar is starting to come out of Morocco that
he might like to try some day.  He fully air dries the wood for one year in
his garage before using it.  He employs no oil or other kinds of curing
processes.
 
A Tim West pipe will come in one of three alcohol-based aniline stains--a
natural, a walnut and a dark or black walnut--with a carnauba wax finish.
He will use the Dunhill or European Red stain, but not often. "I guess I'm
very influenced by GBDs and Charatans from my early days.  Their naturals
were their virgin quality--their flawless or nearly flawless grained pipes.
So I tend to go with the natural color on pipes that are flawless. Maybe I
shouldn't be saying this, because everybody will be thinking that my walnut
pipes and my dark walnut pipes are the ones with the flaws.  That's not
necessarily true, but I don't think it's a secret either that pipemakers
stain their pipes for a reason.  They tend to stain because they're
covering up or masking imperfections on the surface.  Briar wood is not
perfect. If it was, there wouldn't be the mystique about it there is.  If
every single briar pipe had the same grain, it would be like a piece of
furniture.  But since it's not and since it does have imperfections, that
leads to perfect pipes.  So what I consider to be a good-grained pipe tends
to be a natural, virgin quality."
 
During his five years at Monkey's Retreat, Tim signed his pipes T.M. West,
Ltd.  Since then, they have all been hand signed TIMWEST in block letters
(with the same tool).  Tim has never dated his pipes.  Why not?  "I don't
know.  Maybe I'll start next year.  I've been telling myself I'll start for
five years." Tim's pipes range in price from $50 to $150.  The most
expensive pipe he has ever sold was $350.
 
I find it a little difficult to pin down or describe a "typical" Tim West
pipe.  Tim says, "What I call a freehand pipe is what most people would
call a Ben Wade or Standard Danish in that it's got a rough top and a
V-shaped bowl, pointed at the bottom and wider at the top.  That would be
my standard classic freehand shape."  But even the more standard pipes have
a little difference or a little extra something that makes them not quite a
classic standard shape.  Perhaps it's best to let Tim have the last word on
this issue: "You know what?  I make Tim West pipes, and whatever they are,
they are."
 
However, as Tim notes, "It's not like I make a pipe and never make it
again, and every pipe I ever make is always different.  I work from Tim
West shape charts, and I have popular shapes I've created that retailers
are buying from me every time they order. And I've got standard freehand
shapes that I'll make over and over and over again.  So half of my business
may be from models I've made before and am making again, but then the other
half are just new designs, new creations, whatever the shaper/sander
creates."  And, Tim adds, "Freehands across the country are coming back;
they are most definitely coming back."
 
Over the last 15 years, much of Tim's pipemaking style has been influenced
by James Vieth, a Columbus resident who has commissioned Tim to make many
European billiard, Dublin and bulldog shapes from Mr. Vieth's own designs.
These have been lightweight pipes with "elegant length designed into each
pipe, and all have used dark Dunhill-style stains.  Many of Mr. Vieth's
designs have included extra-long sterling silver bands, which traditionally
give a pipe a black-tie, dressed-up look. Tim West is essentially out of
the retail business, so anyone interested in his pipes should first ask his
or her pipe shop if it carries Tim West pipes--and if not, why not?
However, Tim, does do custom orders and duplications.  If you send him a
pipe, he can match its shape, grain and stem.  He also has shape charts of
pipes he has made and is making now that he will mail out.
 
You can write Tim West at 1588 Grayling Court, Columbus, OH 43235 or fax or
phone him at 614-761-3465.

[ Thanks, Bill!  BTW, I comissioned Tim to do a special pipe for me
on the occasion of my Master's degree:  a very large, bent egg shape
with both churchwarden and P-stems.  Had I read a little further
before I started, I'd have likely fired that one up instead of the
Peterson I'm smoking now. -S. ]

Steve, I'd like to share another item from the last OPC newsletter with you
and your readers.  If any of you pipe smokers out there feel moved to
respond to or comment on this subject in any way, I hope that you'll write
me or copy me if you write to the Digest.  I'd like to put a
response survey article together for the next newsletter (late March, 1996) and
probably for the Digest as well.
 
PIPE MYTHS NUMBER TWO
 
     For many years now, I have been fascinated (a fascination that got a
chance to grow during the years my wife was in the antique business) with
old wood.  Even furniture made from wood with pits and worm holes I find
endlessly fascinating and full of character.  So for many years as well,
I've wondered why pipemakers--and not just mass-production pipe
companies--will insist on filling small flaws in their briar pipes with
putty that will invariably turn some nasty, ugly color after many years of
use.
 
     During my interview with Tim West, I asked him about this practice,
and I found his answer interesting.  As always, I invite all our readers to
contribute their thoughts, knowledge and opinions on this issue to help
enlighten us all about the pipes we love.
 
     "It comes from furniture making.  When I was an early pipemaker, it
was one of the marketing things I did.  I never filled, I never glued, I
never puttied, I never seal-waxed the holes on the surface of my pipes.
They were natural.  If there was some kind of imperfection on the surface
of the wood, that was there before I made it, I didn't do that, it was
God-given. This marketing practice worked for a long time until I started
selling to retailers, who have educated their pipe smokers to the point
that the customer coming in to buy a pipe only believes he can get a
good-quality smoking pipe if he can't find any flaws on it.  If he finds an
imperfection...'not in my collection.'  And it's real frustrating.  Because
I get about 25 percent what I call natural or nearly flawless pipes out of
a batch of pipes. The rest have to be walnut, dark walnut or carved.  I
would like to be able to leave the pipes the way they are, and the beauty
of the flaw, when the pipe has its patina and gets its oil finish and gets
its natural dings and dents from using, it just blends right in with the
pipe."

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

<a name="18">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #206 -- December 20, 1995</a>

Dear All,

After lurking for a bit, I have waded in, once a subject I can warm to has
arisen.  Several comments re: #206:
1) "Pipeies"is, I believe, too cute for words.  Might I recommend "Gar-Gods"
for the cigar enthusiasts among us ( I refuse to use the word "aficienado"
and "cigar" together, not because I have any quarrel with Mr. Shanken's
magazine, but because it has caused overuse of the term)

2) the "Cigar Aficienado" effect.  Haven't seen it yet.  I have a wonderful
tobacconist in Charleston, The Smoking Lamp, and they continue to ignore the
dictates of polite society and get good cigars without CA's seal of
approval.  Could I recommend the robusto size of "Mi Cubano" ?

3) Ports and tobacco.  I an NOT an anglophile.  The one thing the British
have done well, however, is the combination of Port and Stilton. I can
forgive any number of toe-sucking royals for that.  But they are right, it
is hideous with a good pipe or cigar.  One tawny port not mentioned, and a
value for the high-volume port enthusiast, is an Australian tawny, Yalumba
Clocktower, an excellent tawny value at about 7 bucks a bottle.  Perhaps
that puts me down there with the hoi-polloi, but I give not a fig.  It's a
great tawny.

Cheers and happy puffing!

Advent and Christmas Greetings to you Steve,

I have thoroughly enjoyed receiving The Pipes Digest these last few months.
I truly appreciate your labor of love in letting us all enjoy the sharing
of our hobby, which is becoming more and more culturally incorrect.

I guess, at 45, I have become an OLD TIMER now. I read with nostalgia the
letter from David Taylor regarding the Minneapolis pipe shops. In the early
1970's when I attended Luther Seminary in St. Paul, a couple of friends and
I would embark each Sat. morning to "hit the pipe shops." The Tobak Shop on
Snelling in St. Paul and Edwards Pipe and Tobacco (first in Roseville and
later in St. Louis Park) were my favorites. WE would carry along a few
favorite pipes, sit, sip coffee, smoke and visit with other  pipe smoking
enthusiasts. Occasionally make a trade or buy a new piece of wood that we
couldn't really afford. Today The PD and alt.smokers.pipes are as close as
I get to that experience.

The Twin Cities was a haven for pipe smokers back then. We could even light
up in class! Most places I go now I feel like a leper must have felt if I
even make a move to light up.

Most pipe shops I have been to in the last 10 years have been the
retail/fast sale/mall variety. I do miss the good old days and the slower
paced pipe shops. I still believe a lot of nice pipes were sold because we
kept coming back and looking at that one fantastic pipe which whispered,
"Wouldn't I look good in your mouth and on your pipe rack at home?"

Regarding David Taylor's mention of Rich Lewis: I have a couple of fine
pipes he made in the mid-70's that are not only great smokes, but exhibit
fine craftsmanship. David mentioned his pipe repair business. I do hope
Rich is still making pipes. He is an artisan.

May you and all the PD readers be blessed this holiday season,

Homayoon Saedi &lt;??????@?????.??.?????.???&gt; asked:

&gt;4. How much should a meerschuam with a tracery pattern or head carving
&gt;   (2.5"Hx2"W) cost and what should I look for? Any mail order sources?

I'm not quite sure what's meant here by a tracery pattern, perhaps a floral? 
 Florals do tend to leaves more than actual flowers.  At any rate, a 2.5"x2" 
floral or figural meerschaum with nice carving is probably going to run 
somewhere in the $100-$200 range.  I'd say SMS is probably the best buy for 
something like this, although CAO also has some very nice pipes.

<a name="20">Subject: Smoke vs computer</a>

I've been enjoying PD for quite a while, but it's been a LONG time since
I've written in.  A comment you made in the intro to a recent PD prompted
me to ask the following question.  Perhaps someone who knows a lot about
computer maintenance can answer this one:
   You mentioned that you were going to fill up the bowl of your pipe, settle
down, and work on the current issue.  My question is this: I've heard somewhere
that smoke particles are bad for your computer (specifically for the floppy
drives).  Is there any great danger to my equipment from lighting up while
working at my computer?  I'm particularly concerned because the "door" on my 3
1/2" drive does not close properly.
Thanks.
-Frank

[ I very much doubt that the pipe smoke would make the drive door hard
to close, Frank.  It must be something else. Do a good visual on the
door and see!

The real concern is that the drive heads, or the disks themselves,
might get dirty.  But Radio Shack and the office supply places sell
head-cleaning kits which (if used regularly) should prevent such
problems. -S. ]

like to get the one's that say, "It's a boy/girl", but the only one's available
aren't the greatest, with the exception of the A. Fuente which appears to be
just mediocre. Also, does anyone have any suggestions on cigars I can hand out

their mouth?

How are ya doin'?  It's a long way from Rutgers, n'est-ce pas? =)

Anyhow, have you ever heard of Tivoli?  I picked up a blend in -- gasp
-- the mall, and it has a sweet scent to it, and an
almost-sweet-but-not-quite-sweet taste.  The name on the bag was Tivoli. 

It seemed safe enough for a mall. =)

Have you ever heard of it?

<a name="24">Subject: Pipe Digest sstuff</a>

Hello Steve &amp; all!  Sorry I haven't sent anything in such a long time
- my computer died, and it took a while to be able to get a new one.
With the death of my computer I also lost my copy of the resource
guide - could you plpease send me a new one????  In the last issue,
Scott Steiner asked about cinnamon in pipe tobacco.  Here, in Europe,
Stanwell makes a pipe tobacco called "The Rose &amp; Crown" which is
flavored with honey, cinamon and vanilla.  It is actually very good,
and is the only aromatic tobacco I buy at all regularly.  I don't know
if it's available in the States, but it can be ordered from Dan Pipe
here in Germany (I don't know if they're in the guide - if not, let me
know and I'll look up the info).  Also in the last issue, Jeff Cowan
asked about Peterson's in Germany.  They are certainly available, but
one has to be careful of the pronunciation: I was in the pipe shop in
KaDeWe here in Berlin, and asked about Peterson pipess, to which the
nice, but very ignorant about pipes, sales woman responded "I have
never heard of them, we have no such pipe here." I replied "Yes, you
do, there are three of them in the window."  "Ahh, Pay-ter-zons."
This was the same lady who, when I said I was looking for an English
blend, offered me something that was flavored with caramel, honey, and
vanilla.  When I said that I wanted an ENGLISH blend, she offered me
something else that smelled like it was flavored with corn
syrup. Blech.  Needless to say, I don't shop there very much.
Recently I met the owner of a pipe company called Reiner's.  They make
some of the most beautiful pipes I have seen in a long time - all hand
made with a very distinct grain.  I bought one, and my wife bought me
one for Christmas.  They're not available in the States yet, as far as
I know, but if anyone gets the chance to buy one, I highly reccomend
them.  They are light, beautiful, and smoke like a dream.  While
talking to the owner, he told me two things I didn't know about pipe
smoking.  One was that you should not smioke the pipe to the bottom.
He said that all of the people that argue that one must do this were
basing their information on Dunhill's book from 1911.  He explained
that the tobacco in the bottom of the pipe filters out a lot from the
tobacco above, and when the tobacco is saturated, one should stop
smoking it.  He also said that it was not important for the cake to
smoke all of the tobacco.  I'm not sure I buy that, but I thought it
was interesting.  The other thing he said was that he fills his pipe
with the stem pointing straight up, in order to prevent crums from the
tobacco blocking the shank of the pipe.  That makes sense, and,
although I never had a problem with crums, I've started filling my
pipes that way.  Well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas and
had/will have a happy start into a good year.  Peace, Dave Roberts

<a name="25">Subject: QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS RE: PIPES</a>

&gt;From : Al Baier
In perusing past issues of PD several questions surface which I thought it
might be beneficial to answer for subscribers:

Q. Where to obtain pipe bowl scrapers?

A. From most tobacco stores.

Q. What is MEERSCHAUM?

A. "Meerschaum" is a German word meaning "sea foam" in the erroneous belief
that it was the compressed white caps of waves. Actually meerschaum is a
mineral mined primarily in Eskishehir, Turkey at depths ranging from 200-400
feet. Chemically, it is Hydrous silicate of magnesium
(Mg4)(H2O3)(OH)2Si6O15.3H2O.

Q. What can one do about loose stems?

A. A stem tightener kit is available which will restore snug fit in seconds.
(see "PIMO" in     PD resource guide). By the same token a broken or worn out
stem can be replaced       in seconds with another kit from the same source.

Q. What are health ramifications for pipe smokers?

A. "Pipe Smokers who inhale live just as long as nonsmokers. Pipe smokers who
don't      inhale live longer than nonsmokers (death rate 20% less than
nonsmokers)". ...      Death rates for pipe smokers are little if at all
higher than for non smokers, even with      men(women) smoking 10 pipe fulls
per day and with men(women) smoking who had      smoked pipes for more than
30 years."
       (Surgeon General's report. Public health service publication #1103,
pp. 92 &amp; 112)
       (From Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter)

                               HAPPY PUFFING AND A LONG LIFE.

Dear Steve,

first let me introduce myself, shortly. My name is  Marian Kubaska, I am 27 
years old, and I am pipe smoker for 6 years. I live in nice town of Banska 
Bystrica in Slovakia ( Eastern part of former Czecho-Slovakia).
6 years after breaking down communism in my country pipe-smoker has large 
variety of tobaccos, pipes and other stuff to choose from.
But there are still things that I miss - information about forementioned 
things, forum to express oppinions, literature dedicated to pipe smokers.
Fortunately, I found some extracts from Your Pipes Digest Mailgroup that 
helps me a lot. (Burley,Latakia,Cavendish,...such terms appearing on the 
products are not described enough in my Webster dictionary).
For these reasons, I would be glad to get membership in your Mailgroup.
I would like to inform the forum about pipe related things in this part of 
the world as well.

	   I am looking forward to Your answer.

<a name="27">Subject:       Re: Cigars and What to Drink</a>

Perusing latest issue, I thought I might contribute to the discussion 
of cigars and what to drink.  I enjoy a nice single malt scotch, but 
I have also discovered that vodka makes a nice combination 
(especially vodka gimlets).  Also, I really enjoyed Even Flood's 
comments ... I find that wine falls flat against a cigar.

I also concur on the younger generation picking up cigar smoking.  If 
the younger generation did not do this (and who cares what their 
reasons are) then the industry itself would be damaged (though I do 
not think in peril).

I agree with Frederick Larson's comments on the association of cigars 
and wealth ... there have been many a day when I have had to scrounge 
up the money for a cigar or (gasp) go without.  I did note, however, 
that CA's current article on buying a yacht to be quite useful (yeah, 
right).

Great observations on cigars, David Taylor!  Knockandoo is a 
marvelous single malt for the $ value, and it is my favorite scotch 
to drink with a cigar.  Give the AF Churchill and #1 a whirl ... they 
are great.

As my first post (forgive my spelling)I want to thank Steve for 
the digest's there great.  My name is Charles Johnston, and I have been 
smokeing a pipe for 3 years (I am 22).
	I first started my best friend had bought a Corncob pipe and a 
pouch of captian black.  My Father had smoked for years but had quit 
(because of Health reasons)but tought some basics of pipe smokeing. I 
then bought a Bent Irish Secounds from the Tinderbox.  It wasnt until 6 
months ago when i started trying their mixed blends and got hooked. I 
bought another bent pipe (an Aldo Velani&lt;sp&gt;) Which after buying a few 
more pipes still go back to it.
	Also I wanted to recomed the people at the Tinderbox (in westland 
mall, in Columbus Ohio)There is a lady (who's name i cant rember)who was 
extreamly helpful abut helping me pick out a blend thats right for me and 
my wife (a non-smoker, who doesnt like nost blends), Who showed me how to 
tell what a blend is made up by and the charactericts of what ever 
mixture of the lovely weed we all love.
	My question (as posted to the Usenet Group) is this: I was told 
to coat my first bowl with honey (I know there is different ways to do 
this).  Do I coat the next Few bowls also? I am trying out different 
methods in breaking in a pipe. ( bought 2 low end pipes to experement on)
Any help would be greatful.

<a name="31">Subject: C &amp; D tobaccos and a question of snobbery</a>

Happy and Peaceful New Year to everybody!

I will send my late congratulations to you, Steve and your spouse. May you
live long and happy in your marriage!

I have not posted for a while, but as always I have read the lists with
pleasure.

Thanks to the list I contacted Craig Tarler at Cornell &amp; Diehl and got one
pound of Oriental Silk, #414, which is an English blend of Perique, brigth
flake, Turkish flake and bright Virginia ribbon. I must say that I love it.
I also have tried #040 (Scot's Heather) and #411 (Constellation) and for me
*Oriental Silk* is more suitable. It is not too heavy,  but a well balanced
and nicely burning mixture. Thank you Craig for that! (BTW, I wonder what is
the percentage of Perique in #414?) 

At first I thought that #414 was quite dry, but as Mr Tarler told me, this
is of no harm. He also warned me not to humidify it. I believed him and now
find his pieces of advice correct.

The other pound I bought was an aromatic (plenty of vanilla custard) mixture
#210 (Berry Good!). On the condition that you reserve a pipe or two solely
for it, you can enjoy its aroma every now and then. It really is a
distinctive one. The other day when I was walking home from work at
university and passing by a mother with her about eight years old daughter I
heard the girl whisper: "Mum, isn't that a wonderful aroma". This is quite
astonishing here in Finland (Scandinavia), where the attitude towards
smoking is very negative. Our tobacco legislation is one of the strictest in
the world, I think.

The customs we must pay here in EU for tobacco from USA make the prizes
double, but who cares when the quality is as high as it is.

As times go by I find myself like more and more English type mixtures. My
wife loves the aroma of *Berry Good!* and tolerates the *Oriental Silk*.
Some of the other English mixtures she dislikes a lot.

Perhaps those of you following  the "alt.smokers.pipes"- news group have
noticed that I happened to use the term *snob* thoughtless. I was near to
become flamed about that. In my article I did not mean that everybody in the
group is a snob when I wrote: "I do not know what the snobs in this group
think..." The discussion turned to the direction of problems of the non
English speaking writers in the net and the misunderstandings arising from
that fact. Indeed, my mother tongue is Finnish and as you can see (read), I
only learned English at school.

So, I want to call forth some exchange of opinions about snobbery among us
pipe smokers. What do the fellow members in the PD think about the following
questions?

 -at which point is a hobby turning out to be a snobbery? (BTW, what do we
mean by a snob?)
 -for example, is it snobbish to argue in favour of or against certain
methods to clean your pipe, or to proclaim that only the briar from a
certain part of Corsica or from some other place in the world is
accepted, etc.? 
-what is the use of discussing snobbery in the PD?

[ Moderator's opinion, take it for what you will: It's not snobbery to
express your own personal preferences. But it is snobbery to say that
the other fellow doesn't know what he's talking about when he
expresses them. On the other hand, contradicting a statement that's
objectively untrue is not snobbery. (For example, if I say that anyone
who likes Dr. Grabows is ignorant, then I'm being snobbish. But if I
say that you'll loosen your pipe stems by taking your pipes apart
while they're hot, then it's not snobbery.)

And, BTW, my wife concurs on the Berry Good! And I have nothing
against Dr. Grabows. :-) -S. ]

I remember getting a pipe from EA Carey a long, long time ago...  does this

"breather" slots along the stem, near the center.  It cooled the drawn air.  
He also had little paper sleeves (called "Papyrate" sleeves by EA) to absorb 
all those vile little liquids and such that accumulate.

I miss my Carey pipe... if this company still exists, I'd order
another tomorrow.

Ave fratres in spiritu!

I recieved my first PD (#206) on 30 Dec 1995 and was overwhealmed by 
its volume and the specific and detailed information contained. So I decided 
to try and contribute something that might be of interest for the forum 
in return. This message has two parts: I. a short introduction of myself, 
II. a recipe for a paste that effectively heals burnt pipes.

I. I'm a 27-year-old German student of philosophy and English 
language and literature (Ruhr-Universit=E4t-Bochum). My special field 
of studies is aesthetics (theory of art, theory of interpretation, languages 
of art etc.). I have started smoking pipes half a year ago, mainly to get rid 
of a bad smoker's cough (having smoked and inhaled hand-rolled cigarettes 
for 10 years). That worked out wihin a few weeks and I got so fond of the 
taste and the mood, that I spent a considerable sum on pipes (Vauen, 
Stanwell, Savinelli) and tobacco (I like mild Danish mixtures: Virginia + 
Burley + Black Cavendish, my favourite is W.O. Larsen's selected blend no. 50)
 by now. 

II. The other day I got two beautiful old pipes (Savinelli and
Oldenkott) as a present from a friend, wich were in a somewhat sad
condition. The Savinelli's bottom was burnt but I could fix it with
the paste described below (the recipe is taken from an excellent
German pipe book by Otto Pollner (who is for us what Richard C. Hacker
is for Americans)): You need: 1 part coal powder, 1 part graphite
powder and 1 part fireclay powder (approx. a small teaspoon
each). These are stirred in water-glass (liquor natrii silicici, 1-2
teaspoons). You should obtain a paste that has the consistency of
modelling clay (not too liquid). The paste can easily be inserted and
formed with the forefinger (the hole should be protected by pluging in
a cleaner). After 24 hours the paste is dry (hard) and the pipe can be
smoked. If the layer has to be higher than 2 mm, apply 2 layers of
1,5-2 mm each (to avoid cracks).  It may be difficult to get the
ingredients, but ist worth the effort.  The Savinelli I fixed that way
tastes perfectly well. I got the coal, the graphite and the
water-glass from a pharmacy and the fireclay from an stove dealer. I
hope the recipe is of use for anybody (please let me know).

The Mall
Rosebank Centre
Tel 011 788 7413 

and in

Tabak L'Art
Shop 109 Brooklyn Mall

Tel 012 46 7781

I can only speak for the Bank City branch: They have a wide selection of 
pipes (from corncobs to Dunhills) and all manner of accessories. They 
also have some very enjoyable house tobaccos. I'm busy enjoying their 
Black Cherry blend. The service was friendly and they supplied me with a 
good number of free tobacco samples with my purchase. 

Looking forward to #207. Happy smoking.

a rough finish and is in the style of a Dublin. It is great, not only do I love
this pipe but, It was great to be able to break in my new pipe uninterrupted
without such things as my studies to get in the way. I hope that everyone has a

<a name="39">Subject: blah, blah, blah, blah, blah</a>

Steve-
	I'm a new subscriber, and the first two issues have been  
great--Thanks a lot.  I would like to address an issue that has been  
important to me lately, and is particularly relevant to those of us  
who enjoy fine tobacco.  I think all of us need to make the careful  
distinction between qualitative and quantitative commerce.  The  
downfall of capitalism in recent years has been the rapid move toward  
the bigger and better.  Centralization, mergers, high volume, and low  
profit margin bring with them the domination of the heavily  
advertised "image", which can only dislocate us.  As consumers of a  
quality product we must become aware of the advantages of the small,  
personal--less economical type of commerce.  Sure, there are dozens  
of mail-order companies that could give me great deals on pipes and  
pipe tobacco.  But I find that the prices can be matched very closely  
at my local smoke shop.  What the companies cannot match is the  
feeling I get when I walk into Duluth Tobacco and Gift and Joshua  
Zimmerman recognizes me in his hoarse old smokers voice, stepping out  
from behind the counter to help me with whatever I need.  They offer  
no smells, conversation, or the time it takes for real  
recommendations.  I have yet to see a catalog advertise free samples  
of all of their tabaccos.  Josh, on the other hand, regularly  
encourages me to stop buy and try out any blend I want to.  Josh  
doesn't do any advertising, so I don't have any images shoved down my  
throat.  As a young pipe smoker (18) I find that I must pay respect  
to the shop that introduced my to the possibility of fine tobacco,  
something that I could call a "hobby" and not just a "habit".  I  
think we all should do the same.  Put in the energy to get to know  
your local tobacoonist--I think you'll find that smoking is much more  
enjoyable when you do.

Hallo Steve and all you brothers  with wood in your mouth !

I'm sitting in the lab with a fine Worobiec #80 pipe wondering if 
there are any other PD readers from Poland... Dear Pals, please let 
me know if jezyk polski jest dla was zrozumialy ! 

In #206 I read somewhere that havin' 1 pipe means being a pipe smoker. 
Well, it's definetly not enough. At least 4 pipes make you a real 
Mr.Yello-teeth-wood-smoker. It allows the pipes to rest for at least 
1 or two days which effects in better cake structure and pipe 
dryeness ( no strange sounds from the bowl while smoking ).
Some friends of mine say that smoking one pipe more frequently than 
once a week is a crime, but to me 2 days seem ok. 

Don't smoke too hot unless you want your favourite Peterson to look 
like a piece if a fine Swiss Cheese.   

Smoke in pace

[ Can anyone tell me what it means to jezyk polski jest dla was
zrozumialy?  I've tried rot13, but that didn't work :-) Welcome! -S. ]

Hello Steve,
  I'd like to wish you and your new bride a Happy New Year, and the same
wish goes out to all readers of the Digest.
  My Christmas was pretty merry, mainly because I had some vacation time
left so I holed up at home through both holidays.  After all the shopping
was done, I even had some money left over so I was able to buy myself a new
pipe to break in during all that free time.  What I purchased was a Wiley
freehand.  I've read some good things about Wiley pipes here in the Digest,
and this one certainly lives up expectations.  It's a beautiful
straight-grained pipe that smokes wonderfully.  I was pleased to find out
that it fell within my price range.

  In the last Digest, Michael Wachs (??????@?????.???.???) asked about pipe
shops in Arizona.  As I mentioned in Digest #205, there's an on-line yellow
pages on the Web at <a href="http://www.niyp.com/">http://www.niyp.com/</a> that Michael might want to check
out.  I found 40 listings in Arizona under PIPES &amp; SMOKERS ARTICLES and 31
under CIGAR CIGARETTE &amp; TOBACCO DLRS RETAIL.  There was some duplication,
of course, and more than a couple of the "pipe" shops were pretty obviously
head shops, but among the rest there's probably some worth checking out.

  Rick Berger (?????@???.???) asked about the metal inserts found in many
European pipes.  These are, in theory at least, a form of filter that traps
the oils and tars from the smoke and keeps it from entering one's mouth.
Unfortunately, they work only too well, trapping all that goo and making
any subsequent smoke that passes over it taste bitter.  They also keep one
from inserting a pipecleaner through the stem during a smoke to soak up
excess moisture.  Like Rick, I just take them out.  A variation on the
theme that I've seen recently is a piece of balsa wood used as a filter.  A
little better, I suppose, since the wood absorbs moisture better than
aluminum, but these too affect the taste of the smoke and prevent the use
of pipecleaners.

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #207 -- Smoke vs computer</a>

[ Posting from PD #207 re smoke and computers deleted. -S. ]

I have a very messy "desk" at home with my good old Mac Plus, Apple HD20,
and Rodime 140 at one end - both external Hard drives. (Yes, Steve, the
Plus is one of the first 4 128K-MAC's at Penn [1984] later upgraded  to a
plus). The other end has my Quadra 700 - with a 17 inch color monitor, a
7 month old Apple 2 gig drive and Apple 600 CDrom drive. In the middle is
my NCD 17C X terminal and an Imagewriter II. Spread across the "desk" is an
assortment of keyboards, mice, trackballs, and joysticks and lots of
"junk." I also have a couple of assorted modems,  but normally use a CO-Lan
connection to run X-remote.

The primary difference between my "desk" at home and in my office is the
large round object with a large cork "island" in the center, and ski-slope
on the side.... a pipe ash tray. The office is now "smoke on the street",
but didn't used to be.

At any rate... there are two primary side effects from smoking around the
computer. (And these really apply to smoking around anything.) First is the
fact that an electrostatic field attracts smoke particles. And what
generates a wonderful electrostatic field... a monitor! So every once in a
while (when it bothers me or I think about it) I wipe off the monitor
screens with a damp tissue.... uck does that tissue get black fast.
"Obviously," this same attraction occurs to a usually lesser degree with
every surface in the office, books, printer, desktop, telephone, file
cabinet handles, etc. The degree to which this is a "problem" is primarily
esthetic. This "problem" is the reason that the "smoking jacket" was
invented by the Victorians. Namely, the concept that ones clothes would
reek of tobacco smoke. So you wore something that you can take off and
replace - a smoking jacket. [I was seriously reminded of this effect
Monday night. We had a major house fire across the street, seriously
smokey. My ski jacket STILL smells like wood smoke after being out in
it for about an hour. Campers also are quite familiar with this effect.

The second side effect is "ash." While not as ubiquitous as smoke... ie
it is heavier and doesn't go as far (unless you sneeze), the area around 
the ash tray tends to get "ashen." (Sorry about that.) And if you are like
me, my ash try sits between the keyboard and the monitor, the path between
pipe/cigar at the lips and the ash tray is across the keyboard. So it gets
yucky as ash flakes off and drops onto and into the keyboard.

So what are the "problem" issues. First the ash - because it's visible.
If you get ash into or onto something, it will muck it up to some degree.
In the case of keyboards, most all keyboards today are completely sealed,
(I also still have a couple of HDS Concepts laying on the floor, Steve,
that do NOT have sealed keyboards. And normal "dust" - everything from
concrete powder generated by walking across the "sealed" concrete floor to
Tipu Sultan's cat-dander causes(d) them serious problems.)

I keep a 1 inch wide artist's brush in my desk drawer handy to use as a
"dust brush" whenever I go "oops." But I usually wind up brushing out more
hair and lint than ash from between the keys. I've never taken any of my
"modern" keyboards apart for cleaning - never had to. But I've taken the
concept keyboards apart many times.

So the ash problem is no different than any "normal" dust maintenance
issue. Keep your floor vacuumed, and you won't have dust problems or flees.
(Tipu Sultan is a Himmaleyan - a long hair.)

The smoke issue is a bit different. Historically, disk drives had a
distance -measured in human hair width- between the spinning disk platter
and the drive head. As disk drives got more capacity and spun faster,
this distance shrank dramatically. Things got to the point where a smoke
(or dust) particle smaller than a human hair was LARGER than the head
gap... enter smoke particle viola - head crash. Today, that head gap is so
tiny that virtually all hard drives are hermetically sealed - ie they are
essentially a "vacuum" internally - so the "rubber DOESN'T meet the road" as
it were.

Floppie drives are inherently resistant to this "teenie-tiny particle"
problem. They normally survive both mustard from a ham sandwich as well
as scotch or coffee spills. While neither treatment is recommended,
floppies are amazingly rugged. I have more problems trying to write 400K
floppies at 1.4 meg than finding floppies "going bad."

Other than disk drives, the other "culprit" is simply the mother board.
It will get "dusty" - period. If you are constantly adding/changing cards,
then you will probably never notice things because you "blow out the dust"
regularly. But if you only ever change the clock battery, you'll be amazed
that the thing works at all given how cruddy it is. (And this applies to
computers in "computer rooms" with "conditioned air" as well.)

Tape drives (we all have lots of 1/2 inch tape drives at home don't we),
are really no different than your audio cassette drive. If you buy cheap
tapes, the oxide flakes off and not only results in drop-out on the tape,
but mucks up the tape heads also. [Hint: how wide is a VCR tape.]

Rumor has it that CD-rom drives also suffer from "dirt." While I have a
"Disc-washer" for my turntable (and needle brush, etc.) I have yet to have
a problem with my ancient audio CD. Neither it nor any of my CDs have ever
been "cleaned." The exception is the "jelly prints" that my son occasionally
gets on the CDs. They get cleaned off with a damp tissue also.

In reality, the real answer comes down to usage and overall hygiene. 
If you are neither a slob nor a clean-phreque, then you will likely never
have serious problems caused by dirt. Although, I find that normal body
oils and the dust they attract cause me to HAVE to clean the track ball
in my non-smoking office building - weekly. It simply starts skipping.

You will likely NEVER have a problem with your hard drives caused by
"smoking by-products" because they are sealed. Similarly, you probably will 
not experience a problem with floppies caused by smoke. You are more likely
to simply "wear out" a floppie or have it suffer from normal dust first.

One obvious caveat.... Backup, source distribution, program disks, etc
should be kept in a conditioned "vault." (We keep our cigars in a humidor,
and tobacco in a "'bacca jar" don't we?) [You do make regular backups,
don't you?] Minimally, these important, one-of-a-kind entities should be
kept in boxes with close fitting lids. And they should be stored in an
area where the temperature ranges between 65 and 68 degrees - ie is
constant. My office happens to be on the 3rd floor of a Victorian in the
city.... read in the summer it frequently gets over 100 degrees during the
day and in the winter below 60. My single malt collection as well as all my
photo negatives are also stored here, so "do as I say, not as I do."
(Our home system has a set-back thermostat, and both my wife and I work.)
And, yes, I leave all of the external Hard drives running 24 hours a day.
The internal HD on the Quadra gets shut off when it's off, as well as the
monitors. 

And remember - By design, an automotive automatic transmission can only
tolerate a loss of one ounce of fluid and still function. When was the last
time you added less than a pint of ATF? Fortunately, it is
"over-engineered." It's the only way that "quality performance" can be
maintained when you have zero control over maintenance.

<a name="4">Subject: Smoke and Computers</a>

Unfortunately, smoke is definitely not a good thing for computers.  Drive 
heads are a problem, and the monitor will attract smoke particles.  I don't 
use the floppy drive enough for it to be a real problem, but I have a 
container of Windex at my desk and clean the screen off every day or two.  
Ash in the keyboard can be anbother problem.  Generally, however, cleaning 
things out with a small vacuum will prevent any real problems.

As far as pipes go, I just picked up a wonderful SMS this weekend at the 
Wharf. It's an overhand eagle claw with a floral bowl carved by Salim, with 
a bowl/shank about 4" long, 3" high, and 2" wide.  The detailling on the 
claw is extraordinary.  Ron has a number of really outstanding pipes from 
SMS this time, and I hope the quality keeps up like this.

hi steve-
it's been a billion yrs since we've chatted so i wanted to wish you a happy 
new year and say that i continue to enjoy ur labor of love.  would you be so 
kind as to query ur readers to see if any know where i can get my hands on 
some tins of atlas (matured cavendish aged in bond) tobacco.  this was sold 
at garfinkel's in wash, dc.  unfortunately garfinkel's has gone out of 
business.  i'd like to buy some tins directly ofr, at a minimum, find out if 
it's sold under some other name and by whom.  it would be most helpful if 
responses were sent directly to me:
     ????????@???????.???.???.???
thanks.  warmest regards-
john

[ Good to hear from you again, John, and happy New Year to you and the
CAPS folks, too!  If anyone has a source of Atlas, please drop the
Digest a line.  Perhaps some of the responders for the Condor queries
have a source. -S. ]

this digest. Anyway, I currently  own 1 straight stem briar; but with this 
pipe I have to re-light too often to burn the tobacco. I would like to 
purchase a new pipe, any recommendations for a beginner?  What about a 
meerschaum? Also I have heard about a pipe club for younger people, does any 
one know the name of this club?
Thanks for all your help,

Mark Faulkner

Hello Steve and all Digest Readers,

This Digest is always a pleasure to read--and _digest_!  Many thanks 
to you, Steve, and to any support persons who assist you in this 
endeavor.

My first smoke of the new year was on January 3rd in my new Stanwell 
briar (is that redundant? I have not seen a catalog to know if they 
also make or sell pipes of other materials).  I bought the pipe 
for my 49th birthday, on December 11th, with some birthday money from 
my dear wife's parents.  It has a bent stem and bit and a fairly small 
bowl.  The orifice sits within a large margin of briar, and when 
viewed from the top, it reminds me of a guyser hole, or some other 
productive hole in a strange planetary landscape--Mars, maybe!  The 
bowl is just big enough to be consumed in about a half hour.  

I smoked a bowl of Three Nuns, "None Nicer", the can reads.  I had 
wanted to sit back with a pipe since Christmas Eve, but just didn't 
have the time.  I hadn't opened the can for a long time so it was 
noisily dry.  I moistened it up for a couple of days with a piece of 
apple in the can.  Great, relaxing smoke, it was.

Congratulations to Eric Campbell on the coming of his child in July.  
I wish you all the best of health and the soundest of advice all along 
the way.  I know the joys of becoming a father, too, although I had 
to wait a long time for the right partner.  I became the father of a 
lovely girl, Sarah Marie, when I was 47.  Sarah is now 21 months old 
and developing at a rapid rate.  My wife and I are busier than we 
have ever known, and sometimes we fall into bed at night, exhausted, 
but happy, with barely enough energy even to fall asleep.  But 
this parenthood thing is great.  I would not change anything major.  
The joys far outweigh any of the horror stories one might be hearing.

I am not at all surprised about the Surgeon General's report saying 
that pipe smokers live longer than non-smokers.  As a practitioner 
and teacher of yoga and meditation, I know the value of learning to 
relax, and pipe smokers really must get to know patience and the 
appreciation of the moment, if for no other reason than to keep the 
thing lit!  It is a hobby for patient, introspective, discerning and 
gentle people.

On the subject of drinks that go with various smokes, I have an 
approach that comes from the way I combine foods and use spices when I 
cook experimentally.  I smell the dish as I go along, then smell the 
spices or other ingredients.  Since the sense of smell is directly 
"connected" to the sense of taste, one can make inferences of taste 
by smelling.  

When I try a new tobacco, of course I smell it unburned to appreciate 
the "nose" of the blend, and for the first couple of puffs I will 
take a small amount of the smoke and let it climb up and out through 
my nose to appreciate it being burned and as it will be appreciated 
by non-smokers. 

Various tastes and smells associated with tobaccos could be described 
with words like: nut-like, burning underbrush, berries, dried fruit, 
coffee/chocolate, anise.  I haven't yet seen references to non-
alcoholic beverages on the list--not only for those smokers who 
prefer not to drink alohol, but also for the purpose of opening 
possibilities.  I would like to suggest some heretofore unmentioned or 
unusual beverages based upon the scent of the unburned and burned 
scents of the tobacco.

For strong, berry-like aromatics:  Some berry or other fruit juices, 
to include prune (!), but probably not citrus juices.  (Have you ever 
drank citrus juice just after brushing your teeth--not a great 
combination.) In Indian cuisine (subcontinental India) there is a 
recipe for Rose Water.  This might be very good with some very sweet 
tobacco blends.  For lovers of soft drinks, how about Mr. Pibb or Dr. 
Pepper to go with those fruity blends?  (Dr. Pepper has prune juice in 
its recipe!)

For aromatic blends with the words 'coffee' or 'chocolate' in their 
names: hot chocolate with or without coffee liquers -- or coffees 
with or without flavorings.

For English blends:  a beer that matches the strength of the blend.  
I personally favor the dark beers and stouts--the more chocolaty or 
"molassesey" the better-- but it also may be desireable for the 
smoker to have a lighter beer that enhances but does not distract 
from the taste of the tobacco.

Also for blends with a lot of Latikia or Perique:  some vegetable 
juices like carrot or celery or blends of several.  If you have a 
juicer or blender, this opens a wide field!

Procedure for choosing:  smell the tobacco, then smell the beverage.

It may be desired by the smoker that the strength of the taste of the 
beverage not be so strong as to confound the tastebuds for the 
enjoyment of the smoke.  The basic function of a beverage is to 
provide moisture.  In my humble and comparatively uncultured 
palate, whiskeys would be too strong for my tastebuds--even numbing-- 
for me when I might be trying to enjoy the subtleties of a tobacco 
blend.  It might be fine for others, however.

Further, a long pause between the puff and the sip, maybe with a sip 
of plain water in between, would help clear the palate.  This, of 
course, is for the really patient smoker!

It should be obvious that I love to experiment!  This, in my opinion, 
is a great way to open our creativity and those new doors of 
enjoyment.  I hope this inspires some creativity in choosing.  

Best wishes to all,

John

<a name="9">Subject: my meerschaum is cracking!</a>

Hi Steve and smokers everywhere!

I've been smoking pipes as an adult, now, for about 7 months. I bought a
$15 briar and it's been fun but I've been looking at some new additions to
start my collection. I have some friends who are living in Turkey and they
sent me a meerschaum pipe for a gift. Excellent!

My in-laws came down for the holidays and my father-in-law smokes pipes. We
even got to have a *spousal sanctioned* pipe fest out on the patio! I
thought this would be a great time to take out the new meerschaum and stoke
it.

Wow! What a difference from the briar I had been using! I decided to try
the samples that Bill Finck sent from SATX and the combination of the
Istanbul blend and the meerschaum was simply outrageous! Now *this* is
smoking!!

My meerschaum is carved as an eagle's claw holding the bowl from
underneath. As I sat and smoked, my attention was turned towards the
detailing of the pipe itself. Hmm, one part of the claw seems to have been
pasted/patched onto the bowl, is it even attached? The other parts of the
claw look OK. One other day, I looked at the shank and thought I saw a
hairline crack 1/2 way up. Hmm, was that there from day one? Hmm, the crack
gets bigger after the bowl heats up, yep, it's a crack to be sure. Then
last night I was having another great smoke and was finishing up and I
*heard* what sounded like a crack coming from the pipe. What a horrifying
sound to hear! This morning I looked at the shank again; it's definately a
crack.

Do you suppose that I just got an inferior pipe or are all the meerschaums
this fragile? Sure the bowl gets warm but not hot enough that I can't hold
it in my hand. I was gonna tell everyone to go and buy a meerschaum but now
my enthusiasm has obviously been tempered. I'd really be upset if I'd spent
lots of $ on one of these. Nevertheless, the meerschaum is still fabulous!

smoke on!
Rob

Greetings from the inland northwest.  I'm a "newby" 21 year old piper living 
in Spokane WA (not by choice mind you by Uncle Sam's loving grace and 
kindness)...    back to my point of this reply!  This is not a pitch for 
this restaurant but a reply from piper to piper.  I have found a great "chow 
house" (as us bluesuiters call it) in the Spokane Valley.  It is called 
Calgary Steak House.  It is a little ritzy steak place and fine foods (like 
turtle soup and perrywinkles [don't ask unless you really want to know 
TRUSTME!!!]).  What is has though which makes me write to you is a fantasic 
lounge with big fat brainsucking loveseat and very very stocked bar (with 
plenty of scotch and ports for your smoking counterparts) and they prefer 
(GET THIS)  PIPESMOKERS!!! and CIGARS!!  The manager says that this is a 
fine house of beef and culinary delights along with the finest liquors and 
spirits, and with those items he wants only the finest tobacco products to 
be smoked there.  NO CIGARETTES!!!  He does have a house pipeblend if you 
run out only (and you have to be a regular to get it -- I've had it!  It's 
called Olympia a fruity , nutty sort of blend and a few cigars (not many 
though)  Just thought I'd tell you about it!!   MAY YOUR BOWL BE LIT AND 
YOUR MATCH STAY DRY!!

you were wondering what "jezyk polski jest dla was zrozumialy" means.

I'm sure you've had a few replies by now, but if not, it's polish and
it means "the Polish language is understandable by you".  Clearly the
answer is no.  Rot13 won't help ;-)

&gt;I don't smoke much in public places; generally I'm at
&gt;home or a friends house, but I find that there is a real
&gt;perception that Old men smoke pipes; the very idea of
&gt;someone of my age, say 24 smoking a pipe is difficult
&gt;for many to take in, it's not so much that people wonder
&gt;what substance I might be smoking, but rather they find
&gt;it hard to comprehend why I would wish to take part in an
&gt;old mans past time.

        I have had the same problem.  I am 24, and my wife, Gabrielle is
20.  We cause quite a sensation in public, as we both smoke.  I am somewhat
of an individualist and I enjoy the looks I get when I smoke my oversize
Ser Jacopo and work on my C++ homework on my Apple Newton.  What a
combination.  Gabrielle gets a lot of attention also.  Her picture, taken
at the Ohio Pipe Smokers Convention sponsored by the local Pipe Collectors
club, has been through most of the pipe smoking publications on this side
of the country.  She has been recognised at several pipe stores locally by
people we've never met ... well, let's just say we make a lot of friends.
We have fun!

Hey Everybody!

Happy New Year to you all!  Well, I've noticed two (among many) 
discussions goind on within PD.  One is the ongoing debate about what to 
drink while smoking.  I've noticed everything from Port to Single Malt 
Scotch, applying to cigar smokers and pipe smokers alike.  I spent a 
couple months in Cambridge, England this summer and learned to mightily 
hate Port, and I'm not a Scotch drinker.  So, while I'm no expert, I'd 
like to recommend a nice glass of Crown Royal on the rocks.  I have one 
with my pipe every now and then, and I find that the two tastes are a 
happy marriage.  The second discussion I've noticed involves pressuring 
Steve to split the digest.  Well Steve, for what it's worth, I'm glad 
you've already decided not to.  God knows how much time you spend 
compiling the existing PD, I think most of us think it's a little 
unrealistic and impractical to ask you to be working on two separate 
digests.  Anyway, great job and thanks for all you do for us.  I really 
enjoy reading PD.  It may be January, but its 74 degrees, sunny, and 
clear outside my window here in Southern California right now, and I 
personally believe pipes smoke better in cold weather, so I helps to keep 
in touch with all the smokers out there freezing their tails off.  Take 
care everybody.

Scott

Hi Steve and all,
Well, the holidays are behind us and I really hope that each and every one of
you had a wonderful time with those you love. I sure did!! I received two
interesting (to me, at least) Christmas gifts this year. From my lovely wife
of 41 years, a large straight grained freehand pipe by an Italian maker named
Lorenzo, with whom I had no previous familiarity. If this pipe is an example of
his normal handwork, I'm very much surprised that he isn't better known, as my
pipe is really something special. My other interesting gift was a briar
plateau and a blank stem from my best buddy, another pipe smoker of many years
standing. He and I have talked for years about someday getting some plateaux
and trying our hand at pipe making. Well - finally he decided to do something
other than talk about it and in his inimical fashion left the potential
massive goofup and it's attendant eternal ribbing on my shoulders rather than
his. Sneaky fellow, that Harold! Never one to pass up a challenge, I repaired 
to the shop and commenced to hack and hew. Imagine my surprise when that
lump of 
hard (read really HARD) wood began to somewhat resemble a pipe. I kept after
it until I'd removed all the wood that wasn't a pipe and I'll be darned if what
I ended up with wasn't a Danish style freehand with plateau top and stem end.
Among my collection are a number of well-loved Ben Wade and Preben Holm Danish
freehands, so I guess I just automatically followed what I liked most about
them in my attack on that poor chunk of briar. I'm really pleased and proud as
punch of this, my first pipe and immediately placed a large order with Pimo
for more briar plateaux and a bunch of stem blanks. I'm off to the races with
a new hobby that really complements my love of pipe smoking and collecting. I'd
like to whloheartedly recommend to all who may have ever had a thought about
trying to make a pipe to go ahead and get started. It's not as hard as you've
probebly assumed it to be. All that's required is patience and a few basic hand
tools. The results may well surprise you -  I know mine did.

Smoke in peace,
Bob

[ Congrats on the new Lorenzo and the new Everett! -S. ]

Steve,

Here's a name to add to the Guide:

Bill's Pipe Repair
Restorations a Speciality
P.O. Box 44021
Oklahoma City, OK 73144-1021

Bill Braddock has been doing pipe repairs in the OKC area for a while. He
does quality work at a very reasonable price.

He has repaired two pipes for me. The first is a Playboy pipe. An
inexpensive, but good smoking pipe. The stem was loose and badly
discolored. Bill banded the cracked shank and fitted a lucite stem. This is
now my "dress" pipe. The second pipe is a Caminetto Business in the Poker
shape. I had broken the tenon. Bill wasn't sure that he could match the
original stem. It had a slight bend at the mouthpiece. Instead of trying to
match it, he installed a new tenon in the old stem.  It's impossible to
tell that the pipe has been repaired.

Disclaimer: Bill is a friend of mine, however, I do not have a financial
stake in this business.

Regards,

John Haldeman

[ Thanks, John!  BTW, I'm of the opinion that pipe repairs by mail
might be a good option for those trying to take refuge from the rat
race, if they could find a willing teacher. -S. ]

<a name="21">Subject: A belated introduction</a>

Dear Steve

After a year-and-a-half of passive reading of your digest, I feel it's 
time that I wrote something myself. My name is Jeremy Martinson, and I 
work as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at a medical research 
institute in Oxford. In addition, I teach Human Genetics and Evolution 
for the Oxford University Human Sciences and Anthropology degree 
courses. I'm 32 years old and have smoked a pipe for two years now: in 
that time I have amassed the great number of twelve pipes, including 
one high-grade which I have just bought this weekend. They are all 
briars - I want to buy myself a meerschaum, and I know just the type 
that I want (I just haven't seen it in a shop yet!). I haven't yet 
established a preference for any one type of tobacco: I have two 
tupperdors, one of English blends, one of aromatics. My current faves 
are Dunhills 965 and Nightcap for the English blends, and an in-house 
aromatic blend called Pirate's Mixture which I bought from a 
tobacconist at my parents' home town in Cornwall. The only other item 
on my CV is that I became a father last May for the first time (a 
daughter, Elizabeth).

I am a regular reader both of the digest and of the a.s.p. newsgroup. I 
dabble occasionally with cigars, but I find the prices here in the UK a 
little too high to allow me to experiment properly. Both resources have 
been tremendously helpful to me as I learn about pipes and tobacco, but 
I find this Digest a particular haven of sound advice, reasoned &amp; 
civilised debate, and a refuge from both intrusive tirades on the ills 
of tobacco and adverts for snake-oil stop-smoking remedies. I think 
Steve does a sterling job.

I was particularly interested in one item in the latest PD (no 207 if 
memory serves) about the availability (or not) of Condor in the US. 
Interested, and bemused, as here in the UK Condor is regarded as a 
supermarket/drugstore tobacco, rather than as a premium tobacco that 
one would actively seek out. I've never tried it, so I'm speaking from 
ignorance here :-). 

I do have one piece of news that may be of interest to US readers 
though. Those of you who follow a.s.p. may remember that earlier this 
week I shamelessly plugged a demonstration of pipemaking held here in 
Oxford by Bill Taylor of Ashton pipes. I got quite a few replies to 
that from US readers keen to buy pipes in absentia. I know that a 
couple of people rang Avery's pipe store (the venue here) and were able 
to buy hand-made Ashton pipes at a very good price. I hope they're 
pleased with their purchases! When I went in to buy my pipe this 
weekend I mentioned to Bill that it was I who had advertised his 
demonstration on the internet. He was very interested, and told me that 
he will be in the US later this year and will be holding a similar 
demonstration at McCranie's Pipe Shop, Charlotte NC in April. You will 
be able to see a master craftsman finish off some of his finest pipes, 
and buy them at a bargain price. Remember, you heard it here first!! 
Oh, and those who remember reading my first paragraph will have 
realised that me first high-grade is, of course, an Ashton. The 
improvement in smoking quality over my usual pipes is incredible. 
Bill's invited me to visit him in his factory when I'm next in London 
and you can bet I'll be going there soon.

Another customer at Avery's while I was there was Clive Humm of the 
Pipe Club of London. We exchanged newsletters - I have a copy of the 
PCoL's latest Journal, and Clive has a copy of PD#207! Clive has a 
computer, but no modem as yet, although he now plans to get one so he 
can join us here. And I've joined the PCoL so it was a very successful 
cross-fertilisation! Clive also gave me a sample of his Bengal Slices. 
Now THERE's a tobacco that I'd like to see over here.

That's enough from me for now. I'll end with a question. I visit the US 
quite often, and have been to several excellent pipe stores there 
(Peretti's and Ehrlich's of Boston spring to mind). One that I also 
like is Grant's of Market Street, San Francisco CA, but I have not seen 
it in the Resource Guide or heard it mentioned in the Digest. Do you 
Bay Area readers know something about it that I don't? I've not bought 
a pipe from them, but I have several of their tobaccos and I think 
they're great.

Bye for now. I'll try to make it less than eighteen months before I 
write again!

Jeremy Martinson

[ You're correct, Jeremy; Grant's is not in the Guide, for some
reason.  (Probably no one's sent in the address.) Thanks for the words

"...if you have never picked up a fly rod before,you will soon find it 
factually and theologically true that man by nature is a damn mess."
		                                -Norman Maclean

This quote, from "A River Runs Through It" (a very good movie and an
even better novella) at the end of Mark Newman's submission to PD #207 
started me thinking:

How many pipe smokers are also fly fishermen?

I count myself among this number only because I own a fly rod and I have
taken fish with it.  Those opposed to blood sports can soothe their hackles
(pardon the very small fly fishing pun), taking some solace in the knowledge
that I am much more adept at decorating neighboring trees with tiny,
expensive, feathered ornaments and creating remarkably complex knots in 
mid-air than I am at actually catching (and releasing, I might add) fish.  
Growing up in the South, I was reared in the tradition of the cane pole
and worm can rather than the more refined religion of the long rod and
fly.  Some day I shall find a non-smoking fly fisherman, and we will
tutor each other in our respective arts.

I have, by the way, found a very good use for my fishing vest.
I am disorganized by nature, and I frequently find myself fumbling for
matches, a pipe tool, or a pipe cleaner--and often for my pipe itself.
Donning my vest, however, I can outfit myself with a day's supply of
smoking accessories without fear of mislaying anything.

But boy, do people stare at you funny.  Maybe I should lose the hat and
hip waders?  ;^)

[ I'd guess quite a few; fly fishing seems like a good place for a
pipe.  L.L. Bean puts out a wall hanging which is a repro of a 1930s
catalog cover: a gentleman in full fishing regalia (waders, rod and
reel, creel, etc.), who has obviously caught nothing. He is chomping
on a small pipe and scowling at a small boy.  The boy has a stick, a
piece of string, and a full complement of fish. -S. ]

Happy New Year, Steve, to you and your bride. May it be a good one. As
I approach my 71st birthday in February, I think back on when I first
began smoking a pipe (when I was 16), and I look at my collection,
each pipe having a history of its own. I smoked a pipe while a Marine
in the Pacific War, and I was a pipe smoker when I was in the Korean
War. In Seoul, the British Commonwealth Division had a NAAFI
(Navy-Army-Air Force Institute) which was the British version of a
PX. The had Dunhill pipes for sale at $7.50 each. I bought two, and
now wish I had bought more. I also bought Balkan Sobranie there for .50 
a can. I enjoy my pipes now as much as I first did, perhaps even
more, because when I first started smoking, the tobaccos were either
Revelation or Rum and Maple. I now enjoy the latakia-laden British
styles more. I particularly enjoy Barrister, an excellent blend sold
by Faders of Baltimore, which has a shop in Annapolis, not too far
away from Bowie, MD. I also enjoy good cigars, almost anything in a
Rothschild shape. Well, enough of this wool-gathering. To my fellow
digest members, all the best for the New Year and Happy Smoking. Ben

Hi Steve,

First of all a big "THANK YOU" to you for all the work you do for us Pipe
collectors!  This resource has kept my pipe collecting alive!

In your last issue Eric Campbell asked about "It's a Boy/Girl Cigars".  I
have been blessed with 4 children and I have had cigars handy to pass out
for each of them.   This is a tradition that is not practiced much at all
anymore.  I am sure that is why it is so hard to find the cigars.  I suggest
TinderBox.  They have them but please be aware they are NOT 100% tobacco!
It was not until my 2nd child that someone asked why I bought my cigars at a
tobacco shop instead of "swisher sweets" !  I spouted off that I only wanted
to pass out "quality, 100% tobacco" and they found the fine print on the box
that informed me otherwise.  But everyone who smoked one thought they were a
great cigar and several people wanted to know where I got them so I kept
buying them for child 3 and 4!   

As for non-smoker gifts, I suggest simple lolly pops or some sort of candy.
Any of the chocolate cigars I have ever had have been pretty stale.  

I have a question of my own.   What is the best solution for  "pipe
sweetner"?   I have tried some from Tinderbox, a small quited expensive
little bottle.   I use Briar Pipe Wipe on the outside and I think it works
great.  I would like to find a good reliable solution for refreshing the
inside of the bowl.   I would appreciate any suggestions!

Hello to Steve and all my pipe &amp; cigar loving friends!

My name is Mike Davin, ??????@?????????.???, and I am glad to be a new 
subscriber to the Pipes Digest. I have just recently (six months) started 
smoking fine imported cigars and will certainly benefit from everyones 
input. I will make a stab at some beneficial input and "tell off" on 
myself some here for the first time.

I caught an inquiry from Frank (Smoke vs. Computer)from the last digest. I 
am currently studying PC repair and contrary to what people believe, smoke 
does affect the PC in most all areas, except, the factory sealed head disk 
assembly component of the hard disk drive. Many other system components 
will sustain damage from smoke. Normally, most people will purchase 
another PC before any real damage surfaces so,...-&gt;
go ahead and light up, enjoy I say! I'll fix it later!

Now it's "tell off" time. I absolutely can't resist an Artuero Fuente 
cigar to save my life! I have sampled every cigar I can get my hands on 
and they all just don't stack ^up. The Cuban Corona natural must have been 
made just for me! I do really enjoy the 8-5-8 and the Hemmingways also 
(umm, a Short Story)!

I noticed that the Savinelli cigar was extra good too. I understand they 
are in some affiliation with A. Fuente. Can anyone straighten me out on 
that?

I would like to know much more about the art and traditions of cigar 
making and smoking. I'll continue to watch for interesting information. 
Let me know of some more interesting sites.

[ Some administrativa deleted. -S. ]

Steve,
     In digest #207 a gentleman commented on the younger generation of
pipe and cigar smoking.  I would like to respond to this by testifying
on behalf of the group growing into the realm of non-parent controlled
society.
     Ironically, the group under scrutiny has perhaps hastily been
labeled generation "X".  There are numerous books and an abundant
amount of studies available concerning the negative attributes this
assembly pervades ( I know, I wrote a paper on it ).  However, an
aspect that can quite possibly not be studied-for lack of factual,
physically tangible evidence-is that which exists in the
"underground", one of the dozens of superficial teen subcultures.  The
difference between mainstream and this "underground" resides in the
cultural traits each respective group chooses to accept.
     The mainstream subculture generally ( and I mean generally
-because individual personal attributes extinguishes complete
isolationism by each subculture ) takes heart in the many facets that
high-ranking TV executives ( particularly teen geared-I'll let you
figure that one out ) and trendy magazine editors yield.  Though I
staunchly disagree with many of these fads and the principles that
govern them, they are of each individuals choice, and therefore their
responsibility.
     The "underground" subculture is typically a much more flowing
entity, often becoming an amorphous blob that circumvents many of
society's mannerisms, and then creating their own.  Here many facets
of other subcultures blend and are governed by themselves, not by
foreboding extracurricular influences, like your parents ( e.g.,
telling you what to wear, what to study, ect).  This is not to say the
two are entirely different, as the flexibility of some parts of the
"underground" may warrant mainstream attention.  Such is the case with
my group of friends, and the school we go to.  The current social
affixations are in turmoil over the "turf".  Though this may sound
humorous or immature, please remember the days you spent crawling the
halls of public institutions, just like my high school.
      The scenario is a perfect one to illustrate my point.  About
four years ago the currently "cool"-warning! this is an extremely
slippery term, see glossary for more details-kids were outcasts as a
rage of collectiveness swamped many of the social groups.  Those who
choose not to participate, and "do their own thing" were persecuted.
However, with the help of massive communication, and a wave of
individualism sweeping the nation's schools, and country, those same
outcasts are now "cool".  The philosophers and artists and
sociologists call it pop, but that is an entirely different subject.
Nevertheless it happened, and what were the implications on those
involved?  Well, though this may be answered by another, entirely
separate paper, the ramifications produced generally subjected several
people, at least briefly-if nothing else, to a foreign influence.
What they were exposed to was quite moving, as a "war"-over "turf"-is
currently be waged by some of the sects, on an low-key level.
     While this revolution was occurring, my friends and I, who are
not technically a part of any mainstream or "underground" social
group, experienced the, what we-'the association'-have labeled the
"Pipe Revelation".  On one of our frequent camping excursions, several
of the members bought pipes in jest of a tip of the
pipe-smoking-culture which we had come in contact with earlier.  To
all of our surprise, this was not a fool's tool. No!  The pipe was a
mighty weapon, used to combat the evils of society!  Actually, that
was our initial reaction.  Now, each member is a mature pipe and cigar
smoker.  Point being, the influences of colliding subcultures may have
significant influence on an individuals tastes and preferences.
     To provide perhaps the best illustration for this, I turn your
attention to the concert scene here in Springfield-and, for that
matter, everywhere else I go to see a show.  Each concert I go to, I
smoke several bowls or toke on a hefty Dunhill, and each time the
comments fly.  Parties are the same.  Denny's is perhaps the greatest
at this ( I say Denny's because we get kicked out of all of the jazz
clubs we go to-even though our purpose is not to drink ).  Point
illustrated, the interruption of normal procession, say cigarette
smoking, was accomplished.  Since this endeavor has begun, my friends
and I have managed to educate several people of my own age.
     The world of cigars and pipes will continue in the lives of those
who meet the virtues of a good bowl, or the curling smoke of a Monte
Cruz.  It will reach some by word of mouth, some by club, some by
supermarket magazine rack [( as I read it is "trendy" for cigar
smoking now ) I do believe the new magazine Smoke will achieve
positive results, again by blending subcultures], and others by pages
like this one.  But whatever the route, it is imperative that it
continue via the clashing of subcultures.  That the barriers and
prejudices be overlooked and the smoke rings admired ( which I am
beginning to get quite well at ).  So, on behalf of 'the association',
and stealing a bit from our fearless leader Steve, Smoke in Peace!

All my life I have heard from teachers, my parents, and almost any adult

Because of all this damn nagging, I have become concened with the 
dangers of tobacco.  And, after doing a little research for myself, I 
determined that smoking a pipe once a week won't kill me.  But I would 
like your imput on this situation.  I haven't become addicted (except to 
possibly the aroma), so should I be worried?  How many pipe-fulls does 
the normal pipe smoker smoke?  

Thanks for all your help.  It will be greatly appreciated.

[ The "normal" pipe smoker?  It varies.  For me, it's one or two a

Hi Steve, You're doing a wonderful job at moderating this newletter, and I'm
enjoying it a lot.  
 
I don't know if any of these are in your list of shops, but I have found a
couple of interesting, albiet small cigar and pipe shops in the
midwest that are worth checking out if you're in the area.  One in Des Moines,
one north of Chicago, and one in Belleville, (east of St. Louis) Illinois.
 
In Des Moines, north side at the Merle Hay Mall, you'll find David's Briar
Shop. It has recently enlarged it's humidor room with a great expansion in
Dunhill cigars.  Very nice white tile floor and a matron who can help you make
selections.  She is very friendly, and will offer as much advice and help as
you wish, or leave you to browse as long as needed.  She will also volunteer
her favorites as well.  There is a nice selection of all sizes of cigars and
price ranges including bulk pack cigars.  They may be short on miniatures if
anything.  But a very nice place regardless.  They also
have an excellent selection of pipe tobaccos and pipes.
 
In Skokie, Illinois, north of Chicago, last fall, I happened upon Cigar King at
8016 Lincoln Ave.  The front looks like (I think it actually is) a Dollar store
with lots of "stuff" inside piled all over the store.  But if you go to the
back of the store, you'll find a small walk in humidor with a nice selection of
cigars at very good prices. Temperature and humidity are carefully maintained. 
A man is there to help you if you need any information.
 
When I was there, he had a "special" on Las Libertadores unbanded cigars at
$1.00 each. I thought these were quite nice and enjoyable.  I also enjoyed some
nice Thomas Hinds.  
 
In Belleville, Illinois, near St. Louis, is a quant little place called
"Robusto's".  It is actually a converted house at 3620 North Belt West, just
off of Hwy 161.  They have a coffee shop with gourmet coffee and snacks, a
smoking room if you wish to linger and enjoy, and a nice humidor with a good
selection of cigars.  Not many in the pricey range, though.  I got some small
Hoyo's and Punch's at 80 cents ea. (petite corona size).  I also liked their
exhibit of cigars for the novice to try.  They had 6-8 different cigars in
plastic bags. One was for the "beginner" with primarily mild cigars like
Montesino and Questa Rey.  Another bag with churchills,  another with some of
the more flavorful like Thomas Hinds and Punch, Another of an assortment of
robustos, and so on. These exhibits were nice to help guide the newer smoker to
some pleasant cigars for their taste.  
 
Those three places were:
 
David's Briar Shop	(Also, two stores in Omaha) 
Merle Hay Mall
Des Moines Iowa
515/278-8701
 
Cigar King (discount prices)
8016 Lincoln Ave
Skokie, Illinois

        Sweet smoking pipe;bright glowing stove

        The pipe, with solemn interposing puff,
        Makes half a sentence at a time enough;
        The dozing sages drop the drowsy strain,
        Then pause and puff, and speak, and pause again.
        Such often, like the tube they so admire,
        Important triflers!  have more smoke than fire.
        Pernicious weed! whose scent the fair annoys,
        Unfriendly to society's chief joys,

Hey, Steve.  I hope your Holiday was nice.  My holiday was terrific.  I got
two great new pipes for Chirstmas along with some great new tobacco.  The 
tobacco is called 'Dolphin' and it is a sweet, aromatic blend.  Terrific 
stuff.  A few notes:

	-Mall tobacco stores.  I know they are cliche, but as the tobacco
	 industry is not as wide spread or as diversified in it's demand
	 as say Wal-Mart, many shops have been forced to move to more
	 commercial, "consumer" areas.  I share many of my fellow pipe
	 smokers contempt for fly-by-night, slick, non-personal, adn
	 capitalistic industries.  A good tobacco store should have not
	 only good tobacco, but also a special personality unique to only
	 itself.  Many mall stores have this, and many do not.  I am 
	 fortunate enough to have a decent mall store on the cusp of
	 personality.

	-What to drink while smoking a pipe.  As I am not of the "age" of
	 alcohol consumption, I strongly suggest a hot cup of Earl Grey 
	 tea.  I take mine with milk and sugar, but you can add your own
	 style to it.  It is perfect for those lazy days after classes are
	 over and studying too stressful.

Well, that's all for now...Have a good week.

As a young pipe newbie I don't have much of a budget for new pipes. But, I
have recently come across a relatively inexpensive brand. My new Barling
smokes cool and pleasant. I hope this helps those of you with tight budgets.

Now for a grin (or maybe a grimace):
(from the 1996 Legal Lunacies calendar)

"The law in 1859 Richmond, Virginia, prohibited women from puffing on cigars.
Females were banned from smoking a cigar in any public place. Nor could a
woman smoke a cigar around men in the home. The penalty was ridiculously

was punished with an incredible eight years in a women's reformatory! This

[ As I posted to alt.smokers.cigars, there's also a law in Illinois
that makes it a crime to give lighted cigars to dogs, cats, or other
household pets. (But that's a good thing; let 'em buy their own!) -S. ]

In PD 207 Don Reid described his strategies for eliminating the after-odour 
of cigar smoke. I would like to report my experiences from another method to 
achieve this purpose. Like many of us, I smoke a pipe regularly, and enjoy a 
cigar occasionally, most of them outdoors in the summer. Recently, however, 
I smoked a couple of cigars indoors. When visiting a nearby city I bought a 
couple of Cuban Cohibas with the excuse that they were intended for my 
fathers 70:th birthday party. Then, on returning home, the thought hit me 
that the rest of the family might disapprove when the smoke would start to 
thicken and demand that we put them out. I couldn't take this risk with 
masterpieces such as these so I decided to smoke them at home while the kids 
were with their grandparents (Well, I figured I needed some excuses to smoke 
cigars at that price. And I promised my father to bring a couple of Romeo &amp; 
Julietas in the summer). The Cohibas were by far the best cigars I have ever 
smoked. Perfectly rolled, mild but with an incredibly rich bouquet. (I 
mention the brand and quality just to make you guys across the Atlantic 
green with envy; I know you can't get them where you are). 

But I digress. The odour from these cigars where quite overwhelming even 
some hours after they where out. Therefor I decided to try one of these 
remedies that are occasionally mentioned, but rarely tried. I put out a bowl 
of vinegar in the kitchen, where I had been smoking. In the morning the next 
day the smell was almost completely gone. Chemically this makes sense, as 
odorous compounds in tobacco smoke are heteroaromatic bases, (if my memory 
serves me pyrroles are important, but I may be wrong on this point) which 
will be neutralised and rendered odor free and less volatile by the acetic 
acid fumes from the vinegar. I think this is a cheaper, healthier and more 
efficient way of neutralizing cigar odours than perfumed candles, although I 
must admit candles look nicer.

At the risk of perpetuating the term, I'd like to wish all my fellow "Pipeies" 
a happy and healthy New Year.  I hope each of you were blessed with a new 
friend to get to know as it is clenched between your teeth over the holidays. 
A beautifully carved meerschaum from my wife still awaits its inaugural match 
due to the rather hectic pace of the season, but you can be sure that it will 
soon be my companion on a cold night near a warm fire. 

I'd like to add my two cents with regard to a couple of topics floating around 
in the past couple digests.  Concerning the choice of spirits to accompany a 
pipe, I have tried single malts, vintage and tawny ports and can attest to the 
merits of each, but have found that my personal preference lies in a snifter 
of brandy or more likely a single barrel bourbon.  For brandy, I have found 
that the subtle fruitiness of a California Alambic better suits a pipe than 
most Cognacs, though I much prefer a Cognac when sipping sans pipe.  My choice 
of bourbon will vary from Booker's (a very strong (115-130 proof), earthy 
flavored single barrel which I cut with 1/3 water) for most English blends, to 
Maker's Mark with most aromatics.  At about $16 per bottle, I find the Maker's 
to be as good or better than most $30-50 single barrel bourbons and far 
superior to most blends (Wild Turkey, Old Granddad, Jim Beam). 

With regard to Bill Unger's story on Tim West, like Steve I purchased a Tim 
West pipe to celebrate a milestone in my life, albeit something much less 
significant than a Master's degree, and it has quickly become one of my 
favorite pipes.  After reading the profile I was ready to chime in about how 
much I enjoy Tim's handiwork, but his follow-up submission about flaws 
caused me to put keyboard in hand immediately.  According to Bill's definition 
I am indeed a pipe collector and choose my pipes not for their 
collectibility/resale value but because there was something special about the 
pipe that said my life would be impossible to live without it.  This was 
definitely the case with this pipe.  When I saw it in a retailer's display 
case, I was drawn to its classic Danish freehand style and beautiful, almost 
straight grain and pulled it out from about 15 other West pieces the shop 
owner had just placed on the shelf.  As I turned it around I noticed a large 
pit (about .5 x 1.25 cm) in the front of the pipe at the top of the bowl.  
&gt;From all that I had read about pipes (I had been only smoking them for about 4 
months at the time) my first inclination was to put it back on the rack.  But 
after looking at several other "more perfect" Wests, I kept going back to my 
first selection.  The "flaw" gave this particular pipe a certain character 
that was hard to resist - like a scar or a mole may lend a certain character 
to a pirate or a supermodel.  I sometimes think about how many others might 
have passed over this beauty had I left it on the shelf that day, but quickly 
let the thought pass as I strike a match and settle back for an hour or so of 
complete bliss.  I would like to personally thank Tim for not putting aside 
this little block of briar as some others would.  

I think I've gone on more than long enough.  Thanks, Steve, for providing this 
forum for all of us.  It has been a source of great enjoyment for me, and I'm 
sure for us all.

Hi Steve,

This is a first time write. I joined just before Christmas and have enjoyed
all the issues. I also read with great inerest "Scramble". What a great
Christmas present. I think I have an answer for Terry Clark on clay pipes. I
do a living history impression of a French Coureur de Bois ( woods runner )
circa 1740 to 1780 and we use clay pipes extensively. Clays are fragile and
break easily and with the advent of briar  slowly  fell out of favor. They do
smoke extremely cool however, and keep a good taste. Clays should not build
up a layer of carbon, I've smoked mine for quite a while and have yet to have
it cake up, although I will admit its is hard to keep one if you use it and
not break it. 

Thanks for the resource guide. I've sent off to the pipe maker of Louisbourg
to see if I can obtain a steady source of clays for my impression.  

Your obediant servant,

Pete Dion

<a name="39">Subject: Praddling about pipes</a>

I've been lurking for several months and enjoyed every minute of it. Well, 
most minutes of it.

A quick CV. Fifty something (that's going to be a TV show soon). People I've 
known for decades wouldn't recognize me without a pipe in my mouth. Moderately 
serious collector, which means I've got some decent pipes but I smoke them, I 
don't just caress them. I also smoke cigars. Married ...  oh, I guess about 
thirty years. My wife once said that either the cigars go or she would. When 
she heard my answer, and particularly how quickly I gave it, she reconsidered.

I have thought of writing several times, but didn't get to it. So this post 
will be long and cover a number of topics.

I get down to the Washington area once a year or so and always go, cash in 
hand, to Georgetown Tobacco. What a disappointment this time. Their pipe 
collection has shrunk to a couple of wall racks with undistinguished pipes. 
Lot's of high end cigars in an enlarged humidor (along with an attendant who 
is not quite sure where Mexico ends and Honduras begins and what might be in 
between). Are all the good old shops going this way?

I picked up a Wiley, not enthusiastically. I have only two, but both are 
inadequately bored. Is this typical of his work?

My preferences in brands does not seem to fit with conventional wisdom. I've 
smoked just about every pipe made, but my favorite and most reliably decent- 
smoking brands are the moderately priced Butz Choquin and Talamona. 
Particularly Talamona. I have several, and every one is a winner. I got them 
when I frequented a small shop that subsequently went out of business, and I 
have had trouble finding them since. Any suggestions? I searched the archives 
and found almost no mention of them.

Regarding smoking in public, which is becoming increasingly difficult. Several 
years ago -- well, a whole lot of years ago, maybe early eighties -- I 
gradually became aware that people were coming up to me and commenting 
positively on the smell of my pipe smoke. Usually women. Usually either old or 
ugly, but you take your reinforcement where you can get it. In an effort to 
quantify this, I kept notes for over six months. Turns out that on average 
once every eight days a total stranger would comment on how much they enjoyed 
the smell.

Things have changed. 

There were recent comments on pipe cleaners. I am a Scot. OK, my ancestors 
crossed the ocean over three hundred years ago, but I'm still a Scot. And I 
noticed that when you use a pipe cleaner, you only really use about three 
quarters of an inch of it and throw the rest of perfectly good pipe cleaning 
potential away. So I buy 12 inch pipe cleaners in craft stores. I use one, 
clip off the bottom inch, and still have eleven inches left. Use it again, 
clip, and so on. You still have to toss the last six inches, but you get a lot 
of use out of one cleaner.

Lastly (yes, I'm almost through), a word on pipe racks. Several words, 
actually. Many words.

A serious pipe smoker will go broke buying those eight-pipe racks and run out 
of desk space to put them on. I came up with a fairly simple, cheap method to 
build extensive wall mounted racks with materials available from any building 
supply store. Get a length of crown molding, a length of finished one-quarter 
by two, and a piece of quarter inch plywood. You will also need a table saw or 
a neighbor with one and a drill with about a 7/8th inch bit. All of the wood 
should be as long as the space on the wall you want to fill with pipes. You 
can, of course, stack them one above another.

Cut the quarter inch plywood into strips about five inches wide. While you are 
at the table saw, take a look at the crown molding. It is designed to be 
mounted at 45 degree angles, and you want to mount it at 90 degrees to form 
the bottom of the rack. So you need to shave off the edge of one side to make 
a right angle.

Attatch the cove to the plywood backing with glue and staples or brads and 
clamps. (Did I mention you need clamps? Borrow them from the neighbor with the 
table saw.) This is the base where the pipe bowl sits.

In the two inch strip, drill 7/8th inch holes on about two inch centers. 
Attach it to the top of the plywood strip -- glue, brads, clamps ... you know. 
Attach the assembly to the wall and you have as much pipe rack as you want for 
a few bucks. Not elegant, but not bad looking either. Slap a coat of paint on 
it before you screw it to the wall. 

So ...  a couple of questions, a couple of suggestions. That should keep me 
quiet for a few more months.

"If you want peace, you've got to be willing to fight for it"

[ Thanks, Duane!  Actually, you've given me some ideas on making your
own pipe racks. You might get nicer results on the racks by buying
plain oak boards (rather than crown moulding) and routing the edges
yourself.  Also it'd be best to use Forstner bits to bore the holes,
and maybe finish with Danish oil.  The little dished spots for the
pipe could be made with a router, with the appropriate jig.  (But how
could you bore the C-shaped holes, or rout around them, without some
hellacious tear-out?)

Good project for a snowy Sunday. If anyone knows of a source of plans
for pipe racks, please let us know! -S. ]

Greetings, fellow Pipe-heads...

now on a frozen winter break from school, i took an excursion to DC for some
job interviews, and to visit w/ an old high school friend last week... while i
was in the reston/herndon area, i stopped by john b. hayes' store... i picked
up three fabulous blends: commonwealth [ a cherry aromatic], mandarin, and
dark
ale... imagine smoking newcastle brown ale and that's pretty comparable.  in
fact, i plan to smoke the majority of dark ale, with my favorite dark ale,
mcewan's export [ an india pale ale for those so inclined].  the interviews
went well and so did my excursion to the store... hayes' shop is located in
the
fair oaks mall, and while he pays large rent, it is a well run shop, w/
knowledgeable sales folk, and a great selection, pipes, accessories, cigars,
and other paraphrenalia...  when you're in the area, i highly recommend that
you visit his shop.

re:

Tivoli sounds like a Tinder Box blend i used to smoke, vaguely aromatic w/ a
hint of maybe almond, or something along that line.... nice fora  while, but i
like McRanie's dolphin better for that type of blend..

see ya next pipe, smoke em if you got em.  peace, will

Dear Steve,

I have been enjoying the Pipes Digest for several months now.  Although I
have been smoking pipes for almost 20 years, in the past year or so I have
learned more from the Digest and alt.smokers.pipes than in all the other
years combined.  What an articulate and civilized group of folks the on-line
pipe smoking community is!

Here is my first contribution to the Digest.  I hope it is useful.

Thanks,

John Edlund

IN SEARCH OF THE COOL SMOKE

    Although I have been smoking a pipe for many years, recently I became
more interested in pipes and pipe smoking, and as a result I have been
smoking more.  This led to a tongue and mouth that were occasionally a little
worse for wear, and I began searching for a cooler pipe.  My arsenal of pipes
up to that point consisted entirely of mid-range pipes and seconds.  I had
good names--Peterson, Nording, Savinelli, Stanwell--but certainly nothing
from the top of the line in any mark.  However, as my fortunes had not
changed, I was not in a position to purchase a handful of Dunhills or
Castellos.  So I began to experiment with some different designs instead.

The Churchwarden

    The first pipe I bought with the cool smoke in mind was a Stanwell briar
churchwarden called the "Hans Christian Anderson" model.  This pipe came with
two bits: a standard length and a churchwarden.  (It also came with a green
Stanwell tote bag, which my wife found to be the perfect thing in which to
carry her ice skates.) The pipe is a delight to smoke and is definitely
cooler with the churchwarden bit.  I believe it is not merely the extra
length that cools the smoke.  Somehow, the extra length changes the physics
of the draw in subtle ways, making it easier not to oversmoke the pipe and
create a furnace.  The pipe stays lit with slow and meditative puffing, and
the physical length of the thing discourages one from moving about very much,
so that one does not have to even think about getting up to mow the lawn or
trim the roses.  Definitely a success in the search for the cool smoke, but
as any smoker knows, one cool pipe is not enough.

    A clay churchwarden would be another candidate for a cool smoke, but so
far I have not been able to find one at a reasonable price.  The clay is so
fragile that people in the seventeenth century bought them by the dozen, or
even by the gross.  Nowadays it seems that they are being sold as authentic
replicas of the past.  The last one I saw cost $45.  I will continue to
search.

The Calabash

    This Christmas I got a Pioneer calabash.  I had heard about the calabash
pipe, but I had never really looked at one closely.  For those who haven't
examined one, it is a simple and effective design consisting of four pieces:
a large piece of block meerschaum with a fairly large bowl bored into it, the
gourd, a black lucite ferrule, and a black lucite bit.  The meerschaum sits
on top of the gourd, held tightly in place by a cork gasket.  Although the
meerschaum doesn't exactly screw in, I was advised to turn the bowl 1/4 turn
counter-clockwise to remove it, and 1/4 turn clockwise to seat it again, and
to remove the bowl periodically to let the gourd dry out.  So far it has not
been necessary to dry it out.

    The calabash provides a very cool smoke, because of the large air
chamber in the gourd.  I have been smoking Cornell &amp; Diehl #531 in it, and it
is just delightful.  It is a large pipe, and a little heavy, so it is
definitely a stay at home smoke and not a pipe to hold in your teeth while
working on something, but it has quickly become my favorite companion with a
book.

    Smoking a calabash is almost effortless.  I rarely have to relight, and
there is never any dottle.  It smokes down to grey ash every time, and it
lasts a long time, on one occasion, through an entire samurai movie.  The
gourd has already begun to darken with use, even though I have probably only
smoked it about 10 times.

The Kirsten

    I heard about Kirstens on alt.smokers.pipes.  I sent away for their
catalogue and received it very quickly.  They call it "the world's coolest
pipe." I faxed them an order for a 1/4 bent Cavalier at $40, and received it
in six days.

    A Kirsten also consists of four basic parts--the aluminum "radiator"
stem, the valve on the front, the mouthpiece, and the screw on bowl.  The
stem comes in black, silvertone or brasstone; the mouthpiece in ebonite or
lucite, and there are several bowl shapes with a variety of finishes.  The
bowls are mostly briar, but you can also get meerschaum.  Mine has a medium
light-finished briar bowl in a shape called "mandarin."  There are several
standard packages, but in effect you can order any combination of parts you
like.

    According to the catalogue, the basic design was created by Dr. Kirsten,
an aeronautical engineer, in 1936.  He had been advised by his doctor to
switch to a pipe from cigarettes, but he didn't like the briar pipes
available to him.  He was trying to get the cooling properties of a
churchwarden into a smaller, more portable package.  The result certainly
looks like a pipe designed by an engineer.  It has a sort of "future as seen
from the past" quality, like it came from an old movie serial like Flash
Gordon, or Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen.  The briar bowl just
doesn't look quite natural sitting on top of the shiny, cooling fin-equipped
aluminum barrel, but I suppose that it is a tribute to the exceptional
qualities of briar that there is no satisfactory high tech material to
replace it.  The full bent pipes in the catalogue look somewhat like
saxophones, and one large black full bent with a white meerschaum bowl
doesn't look much like anything readily identifiable at all, though it _is_
rather attractive.

    The bowl on mine, which has a nice mixed straight grain,  is wider and
shallower than most briars.  I have a bit of trouble at the beginning,
usually requiring two or more charring lights, but after you get it going it
smokes well.  There is a bit of a metallic taste until the pipe warms up.
After that, it is an enjoyable and flavorful smoke, and quite a bit of fun.

    Is it cool?  Well, as you smoke, moisture from the tobacco condenses
inside the barrel of the pipe, as the excess heat radiates from the aluminum
surface.  This moisture would have otherwise arrived at your tongue as steam,
so it is beneficial to remove it.  You can turn the valve and shut off the
draft hole, so the condensate can't leak out into the bowl when you dump the
ashes or put the pipe in your coat pocket, as tends to happen with a Peterson
system pipe.  All in all, the Kirsten works well, and delivers a smoke that
is cooler than the briar churchwarden, but not quite as cool as the calabash.
 Opinions will certainly differ on the aesthetic qualities of the Kirsten,
which may offend, intrigue or delight you, but all three pipes are noticeably
cooler than any of my standard briars, and offer a respite from tongue bite
and cooked mouth.  Of course, as always, your mileage may vary.

Hi pipers.  I am new to the world of pipe collecting.  I recently  
went to my local pipe shop and selected a nice briar 'second.'  With  
the purchase of the pipe I was allowed to select an ounce of tobacco.   
I chose a wonderfully aromatic blend called champagne.  It smelled  
wonderful.

Now, I have been around people smoking pipes before and have very  
much enjoyed the smell.  When I lit this thing, not one smidgen of  
the previously wonderful aroma was present...all I got was the taste  
and smell of old, stale, burnt tobacco -- quite similar to what I  
remember my old high school restroom smelling like.  This cannot be  
what pipers enjoy.  I know that something must be wrong.

Is it possible I am doing something wrong?  Or could a cheaply made  
pipe result in such a distasteful and smelly mess?  I read the howto  
docs and faqs.  Honestly, none of the smells I associate with being  
around pipe smokers in the past was present here...this was as bad as  
or worse than cheap cigarrete smoke (no offense, but cigarette smoke  
bothers me).

Any advice or instruction would be greatly appreciated...thanks.

Sir,
I wanted to let you know that Wilson/Lucas, Inc. of Moscow, Idaho have
produced the Rudyard Kipling poem, The Betrothed, as a suitable for framing,
full color art print (18x24). This work expresses the sentiments of cigar
smokers everywhere and of course has the famous line A WOMAN IS ONLY A WOMAN
BUT A GOOD CIGAR IS A SMOKE. If any are interested in such a product, they
can write Wilson /Lucas at P.O. Box 10001, Moscow, Idaho 83843 or call
208-883-3300. The product costs $39.95 plus shipping and handling. A
postcard version is also available and can be sent as sample on request.
One can also reach me at my email address (I am the Wilson of Wilson/Lucas).
Feel free to let anyone else who loves cigars know of this. Thank you.

Your humble servant,
Evan Wilson

[ Done, Evan!  Though I doubt that, with many women smoking cigars
these days, the poem expresses a universal sentiment... In "With Pipe
and Book" (the book, not the shop) are a couple of poems _by_ woman
cigar smokers; perhaps you'd consider putting those out as well? -S. ]

[ADMIN] I've made a few changes to the intro letter (among other
things, removing the suggestion that new members an introductory
letter.)  This was originally put in during the Dark Ages, when there
generally weren't enough submissions to fill the Digest.  As some have
pointed out, we don't have this problem anymore :-)

<a name="2">Subject: subscribing to pipe digest</a>

Thanks for the pipe digest.  I've heard a lot about it.

I just filled out the registration so, here is a litttle pipe bio per 
your request:

I collect Butera and Ser Jacopo as the primary brands in my collection 
although there are plenty of other Italian and English brands along 
with some Danish pieces in my collection.  I collect mostly briars 
although I do have some meerschaum.

Shapes of interest include bent bulldogs, authors and Rhodesians; 
calabashes (briar and gourd) Oom Pauls, bent billiards and bent apples.

Blends of choice:  Full English and Matured Virginias especially 
Esoterica Tobacciana blends and Butera Latakia 1 and his several 
Virginias.

I'm an internet newbie (two days ago), but have been puffing on my 
pipes since '69; cigars since '67.  

My first pipe was a baby gift (I still have it).

I'm trying out netcom and if I try any others I'll keep you updated on 
address changes.  Thanks in advance for bearing with me on this.  I 
look forward to getting the digest.

Dear Fellow PipePeople...

I am seeking the names and addresses of businesses and/or companies in the US
or Canada that sell refurbished used pipes (predominantly from the Sherlock
Holmes Pipe Collection series).  As well, I understand Series II of this
collection has begun...any referrals to locate this series from a Canadian

Dear Steve, et al,

    In response to Mark Faulkner's query about meerschaums, by all means try
one!  I've been smoking pipes for the past twenty years and just bought my
first meerschaum a week ago.  It's a much drier and more pleasant smoke.  I
had avoided them in the past because the only ones I could seem to find
were, IMHO, garish and too expensive.  I obviously gave up to soon because I
found a nicely carved, small billiard SMS block for $27.  Look around,
they're out there.

Hello Steve,

I have been reading your article for about 5 months now and I find  
it to be a treasure chest of knowledge..

I am a tobacconist 3rd class at a local shop in the chicago area .  I
guess I am what your readers would call one of the "new wave"
tobacconist because I am so young , but thats OK.  just wanted to say
hi and thanks for all the info.

Hello everybody -

I wanted to leave a quick message for those of you who are trying to reach
the Pulvers' Prior Briar tel #.  The authentic # is now: 1-800-863-PIPE -
not 415-691-0338 - Please make a note of it.  Your orders should be
processed much faster now.

I just lit up a reconditioned pipe from L&amp;Co - and it smokes great.  I just
tried Margate tobacco, and it looks like it's going to be one of my
favorite blends on my very small list.

I just got # 208 - Thanks Steve!

<a name="9">Subject: Kabik Pipe</a>

I don't smoke my pipes very much these days (mostly cigars), but I
have one pipe I've never quite been able to sell, give away, or store
in a closet.  It's a straight-grain freehand that I bought about 20
years ago.  On the back, under the stem, it's inscribed "Sculptur by
Kabik."  I was given to understand that the pipe maker carved pipes
for Ben Wade, and also sold pipes under his own name.

    Do you, or any PD readers, know anything about this pipe?

    Also, thanks very much for PD -- it's always a welcome arrival in 
the E-mailbox.

From: ????????@??????.??? (Paul J. Ste. Marie)
<a name="11">Subject: Cracking Meerschaums</a>

&gt;My meerschaum is carved as an eagle's claw holding the bowl from
&gt;underneath. ... One other day, I looked at the shank and thought I saw a
&gt;hairline crack 1/2 way up. Hmm, was that there from day one? Hmm, the crack
&gt;gets bigger after the bowl heats up, yep, it's a crack to be sure. Then
&gt;last night I was having another great smoke and was finishing up and I
&gt;*heard* what sounded like a crack coming from the pipe. What a horrifying
&gt;sound to hear! This morning I looked at the shank again; it's definately a
&gt;crack.
&gt;
&gt;Do you suppose that I just got an inferior pipe or are all the meerschaums
&gt;this fragile?

Two possibilities--1) the crack was there to begin with or 2) you've let a 
cake build up in the meerschaum.  DO NOT LET A CAKE DEVELOP IN A 
MEERSCHAUM!!!!  The meerschaum is softer than the cake and it will crack 
very easily, since the cake expands with heat faster than the meeschaum 
does.  You can ream it out, but you've got to be very careful in the 
process--the reamer will remove meerschaum faster than cake, so you've got 
to watch for spots where you've reamed away the cake and stay away from those.
The other big no-no with meerschaum is tapping out the ash, especially while 
holding the stem or shank.  This is a good way to knock the bowl right off 
the pipe.  To empty a meerschaum tip it upside down, and if the ash doesn't 
fall out on its own use a pipe tool to gentle loosen it.  Don't dig at the 
pipe.  Wiping out the bowl after use with a cotton cloth (old t-shirts are 
good for this) will help keep a cake from forming.  Any sticky tar deposits 
can be **gently** scaped away with a pipe tool.

Two basic principles to always remember with a meerschaum:

1)  No cake.  It doesn't need one, and a cake will split it apart.

2)  Never apply any sort of force on the shank relative to the bowl--eg no 
tapping, no holding the shank while reaming, etc.

Any insurance agents out there?  I've been doing some consulting work for a
local agency that does business over the internet, and the question of rate
discrimination for cigar and pipe lovers came up.  There was an article in
the Fall Cigar Aficianado that listed some insurance carriers that offer
non-smoker rates for cigar smpkers.  However, these were all "captive"
agencies (those whose agents can sell policies only for that particular
company).  Are there any non-captive companies that offer separate rates?  I
understand the reasoning is that they give a qualification physical that
tests for nicotine in the blood, and cannot differentiate between cigarettes
and other forms of tobacco.  I'm wondering why the captive companies can
offer lower rates.

<a name="13">Subject: Lighter repairs &amp; Barling pipe's history</a>

Dear Steve:

Thank you for changing my address. As for the question of Pat Barling about 
information on the history of Barling pipes (PD 208), R. Hacker's book "The 
ultimate pipe book" has a good synopsis about that subject. Also there is an 
excellent article "A smoker's guide to Barling" by T. Gage in "Pipe 
Friendly" vol. 1, # 3 pp. 7, 1995.

There was also an inquiry sometime ago about a place which can repair 
expensive cigarette and pipe lighters (Dunhill, Dupont, Christian Dior, 
etc.). The following is the address of an excellent place which you can add 
to the directory:

Authorized Repair Service
30 West 57th Street
NYC, NY 10019
Tel: 212-586-0947
FAX: 212586-1296

I have also noticed in your update of the directory that you did not include 
as per PD 195 the excellent pipe and tobacco store her in Birmingham AL This 
store has a larger and better quality pipe selection than many of the big 
name stores I have visited around the country. For your convenience, the 
name and address again is: 

The Briary
741B Brookwood Village
Birmingham, AL 35209
Tel 205-871-2839.

Dear Steve,

I subscribe to the PD under a different e-mail address
(??????????@???.???). Haven't written for some time, but there was a
notice in the latest issue about Gawith Hoggarth &amp; Co. I have dealt
with Bob Lynch for about a year, and I find many of his tobacs
outstanding. It is the only place I know for gettin STRONG
tobacs. These include the twists, dark flake, and my favorite, Bob's
square cut. Bob Lynch, the proprietor will be away from home from the
end of January until mid April. Lucky man! At any rate, those who try
to contact them will probably face a lengthy delay because of this.
In his brochure, Bob includes an alternative address: Tom Colwell 325
Germonds Rd.  W. Nyack, NY 10994.  I haven't tried him, so can't vouch
for results.  Regards, Michael Braun

     the message was returned. Looking it over again, I suppose it's OK to 
     post to the Digest. Maybe Stephen will get my scribblings this way. 
     --------------------------------------------------

     Dear Stephen ....
     
     I wrote to say that I found your recent post to the PD interesting and 
     informative. I wasn't sure exactly what document/message/topic you 
     were responding to, but I was intrigued by your insights concerning 
     pipe and cigar smoking among youth. 
     
     I was principally interested in the topic because, even at my age 
     (33), I have felt over the past few years very inhibited by the 
     prospect of smoking my pipe in public. I was encouraged to know that 
     you have noticed this contradictory social prohibition and taken a 
     course of action among your peers. Although I can't say I've shared 
     the experiences you described, I tend to agree with a few of your 
     premises and would like to see the culture surrounding pipe and cigar 
     smoking to continue its evolution. I would also like to see in the     
     general public a recognition that pipe and cigar smoking are practices 
     which are entirely distinct from the more conventional (ab)uses of     
     tobacco in U.S. culture.
     
     As I mentioned, I have felt of sorts as a pipe smoker. I think I first 
     started smoking a pipe (in secret, of course) when I was 16. At 18, I 
     went to university, where I fairly quickly made several friends who 
     also smoked pipes occasionally. This was not an act motivated by a 
     reaction to the social environment, but by an attraction to the 
     pleasures of smoking fine tobacco. All during my undergrad. and 
     graduate school days, pipesmoking was relatively common among my 
     classmates, so it didn't seem at all odd to be a pipesmoker in my age 
     group. It was also an activity that marked camaraderie and friendship. 
     I was not alone, and pipe smokers were generally not socially 
     marginalized, certainly not in my social milieu. In fact, a visible 
     proportion of 17- to 22-year-old undergraduates smoked pipes on my 
     campus. After a time, though, it somehow became less socially 
     acceptable to be seen smoking anything. While I have certainly 
     welcomed the general prohibition against smoking in public places, I 
     don't really consider my sometimes infrequent pipesmoking to fall into 
     the same category as the most common form of tobacco (ab)use. It is 
     not a physical or chemical addiction for me (sometimes I don't 
     smoke my pipe for weeks at a time). However, the only places (other 
     than home and foreign countries) where I feel truly comfortable 
     smoking are pipe shops. And even there, I sometimes get an occasional 
     odd look - because (I'm sometimes told) I still don't quite look my 
     age. I've met a few fellow pipe smokers on my periodic trips to the 
     tobacconist and elsewhere, but my sense is that many of us feel 
     inhibited. One thing I have noticed over the last year, however, is 
     that pipes and cigars are appearing on my campus with more frequency. 
     I think a small portion of the student population may have begun to 
     appreciate the aesthetic qualities of the pastime.  
     
     Thanks for the interesting post.
     
          John

<a name="17">Subject: younger cigar smoker</a>

hi,

My name is Andy Hacker. I'm 23 years old and I've been smoking cigars for
over 2 years now and I love them. Unfortunatly, I don't have many friends who
are cigar smokers themselves. So basically I end up smoking outside on my
own(pretty rough huh?) Anyway, I don't mind it that much. 
My first cigar experiences were over 2 summers ago and Phillies Titans, which
since then I'm well beyond them. Soon after  that came the first cigar shop I
ever set foot into, in Hartford CT,  and to tell the truth I felt like a kid
in a candy store. I had no idea what to get, but I wanted one of everything.
I ended up with a Macanudo and an Oscar. I kept going back, and now i visit
 2 shops local to me in NJ and when I'm in New York I visit Nat Sherman,
which is a beautiful place.  My personal favorites are Nat Sherman
Telegraphs, Macanudo  Prince Phillips, Ashton 8-9-8s and Las Cabrillas
DeSotos. Although when I was starting out I did have the luck of trying my
first Cuban cigar(and only to this point) A Cuban Montecristo, and that was
the smoothest cigar I've had to this point. 
Unfortunatly, as I said there aren't to many cigar smokers my age in this
area. If anyone knows of cigar groups in the central NJ area I'd like to find
out about them. I know of one in Trenton and one in Wayne,NJ but I figure
that they are for an older crowd.  My e-mail  is ????????@???.???

In issue #208, someone wanted to know why "Grant's" pipe shop in San
Francisco was not on the resource guide.  Here is the address
Grant's 
Pipes, Tobaccos, Fine Cigars
564 Market St.
San Francisco
(415) 981-1000

I have only bought pipe tobacco there.  The blend I like from Grant's in
called "No. 2131".  It's got a bit of Latakia in it so I guess that it's an
English style.  Grants pipe selection was o.k.
The Bay Area shop that I think is just great is Sherlock's Haven.  I have
never seen so many pipes in one store ever.  And there prices seemed very
good.  They had a Petersen system pipe selling for around $30 and I remember
buying the same pipe 8 or 10 years ago in Houston for around $40 to $45.  The
next pipe I get will probly be from Sherlock's Heaven.

The last pipe I bought was from the "Piedmont Tobacconist"  in Oakland CA.
 It was made by a maker in Santa Cruz CA by the name of "Andre".  The pipe
only cost $25 but it  smokes great!    The pipe is  a small straight pipe
with an apple bowl.  I'm very glad to know that you don't have to spend a
fourtune to get a great pipe.

Hi, All!   

I hope that everybody is enjoying the new year and I would just like to
remind everybody that cigar aficianado George Burns turns 100 years old (yes,
100 years old!) on Saturday, January 20!

By the way,  in the last post, you said:

"smoke is definitely not a good thing for computers."

I don't know about you guys (and girls), but I don't enjoy smoking near the
computer.  First of all, it causes damage.  And I am not in the position
where I have the time to clean or replace my equipment.  

Second of all,  to me, smoking is not a "thing;" it is an art.  To me, it is
not done while watching tv or using the computer.  Smoking is something that
should be savored.  It is what should be done while sipping fine cognac,
talking with friends, or after enjoying a heavy meal.   

Smoking is not an addiction, it is a form of relaxation.

Anyway, this is just my opinion.

Steve,

	I am fairly new to pipe smoking and PD, so this is my first post.
In my area there are not more than 2 or 3 smoke shops that I know of, and 
the ones that there are do not seem to be geared towards pipes but more 
towards cigars and buying bulk cigarettes.  I started smoking with a 
second that I got at the one store that carries an assortment of pipes.  
I would like to get a few better pipes but have not been able to locate 
any of the names normally seen in PD.  Here's my question, finally.  The 
store owner has, and recommends, Alpha's. Are these pipes worth buying, 
and does anybody have any opinions about the Alpha's?

	On a different note I recently read the last issue of PD in which 
Paul Kupferschmidt  submitted poems from "Pipe and Pouch."  I have also 
recently read this entire collection and ironically enough was going to 
mention it in my first letter to PD.  This book contains poems on 
smoking that express my own and many others view,s which I am sure anybody 
who subscribes to PD would love.  It is my favorite book of poetry which 
I intend to buy as soon as I can find it.  I highly recommend it to 
everyone in this group.

	That is about all for now so until next time, happy puffing.

&gt;I was particularly interested in one item in the latest PD (no 207 if

&gt;Interested, and bemused, as here in the UK Condor is regarded as a 
&gt;supermarket/drugstore tobacco, rather than as a premium tobacco that 
&gt;one would actively seek out. I've never tried it, so I'm speaking from 
&gt;ignorance here :-). 

Wow!  Condor available in supermarkets!  Fantastic!  I always thought the
U.K. civilized. :)

P.S. I've received orders from John Turner and G. Smith &amp; Sons (both very

<a name="23">Subject: MAGNUM-PLUS Size Pipes</a>

Is anyone out there interested in BIG, MAGNUM-PLUS size pipes and cigars?

I have been smoking a pipe for 20 years now, and have always looked for the 
largest possible pipes.  I am a fan of big pipes for the sake of 
their appearance and for the way they draw.  A major part of my enjoyment in 
pipesmoking is inhaling the smoke, rather than just puffing away - this tends 
to heat the bowl up quickly.  I have found that the larger the bowl, the easier
it is to smoke for longer periods of time without overheating the pipe. 

For the last six years, I have been collecting pipes from JM Boswell,
170 South Main St, Chambersburg, PA 17201, phone (717)264-1711.  My
latest pipe is a nearly perfect straightgrain quarter-bent billiard
(length 14", height 3.5", and inside bowl diam 1.5"- 1 oz tobacco
capacity).  The workmanship is beautiful and the draw is excellent.

My longest Boswell is 22", but the biggest one overall is a rough carved finish
billiard/Canadian 14" long, 7" high, and an inside bowl diam of 1.5".  The
airhole is 1/4" from the bowl to the tip of the bit, which is custom made of
clear lucite. You can literally breathe through this pipe without having to 
pull hard.  This one holds about 1.5 oz of tobacco, usually English. 

I would like to share information/pictures with Magnum Pipesmokers.
I'm always looking for a source for bigger bowls!  My address is:

Steve,

  Thanks for the great work you're doing on PD. It's a real pleasure to sit
for a time with a fine pipe, a glass of spirits, and the wealth of insights
in these pages.

   A couple of issues back, you asked about pipes with multiple (fixed)
bowels.  Here are the specifics for the work of a local - west coast -
carver.   His pipes have 3 bowls on seperate branches.  Each is removable
(for cleaning).  The bowls and stem are attached with Jobey fitments. There
is a slight dip to them like the old safari pipes.  There are no valves, you
would have to cap one or two bowls when not in use.  These pipes are made
from 3 blocks of briar in apple shape.  Smooth  =$300.00 &amp; Blast (somewhat
smaller) =$200.00. 

  Apologies for not mentioning the carver by name, but he is retired and
doesn't want publicity.  I can only say that I have over a dozen of his
pieces and am quite satisfied with all of them.  If you or anyone else wants
to get one of these pipes, I'll act as his unpaid agent.  Lastly (I hope I
don't say this badly)... this is not his favorite style to make, but he'll do
it if you're truely interested.

  On another matter Bill Unger (for C.H.'Sarge' Stock) asked about TB#1:

  Also, belated congrats on your marriage.  I wish you much happiness.

  Lastly, I'll put in a shameless plug for PIPE FRIENDLY.  With the February,

<a name="25">Subject: Pipe Sweetening</a>

I saw the question in the latest PD about pipe sweetening.  I worked at a 
Tinder Box for 17 years.  We used to refresh and refurbish pipes for 
customers. I always told people not to use bottled  sweetener. First the 
stuff has mint flavorings, not something I want in my pipe. The main 
ingredient for sweetening is alcohol.  I use and suggested using your 
favorite whiskey, vodka or bourbon.  Place the pipe in a single stand or an 
ashtray(without the stem) and fill the bowl with the booze of choice. Let 
stand for a few minutes then wipe out the bowl with paper toweling.  Run 
pipe cleaners through the air hole until they come out clean.

If the stem is not Lucite, dip a pipe cleaner in the booze and run it 
through the stem. If the stem is Lucite, use only warm water and soap to 
clean. alcohol will melt Lucite!
Let the bowl and stem dry for a day then enjoy!

In extreme cases of sour pipes use this method: fill the bowl with table 
salt, let stand for a day, dump it all out and then do the booze treatment. 
 The most important thing is to let your pipe rest and air out. Smoking the 
same pipe over and over will yield a very sour pipe.

I know many readers are very young and would not remember the hey-day of 
pipe smoking in the mid to late 70's. Working at the Box was great then, we 
blended custom blends mixes for hundreds of smokers.  The store record for 
Camminetto sales in one day was 17!  Some guys would by a premium pipe every 
time they came in!

I taught many, many people how to pack their first bowl and loved the look 
on their faces when they puffed their first puff as a pipe smoker. I tried 
to help the younger fellows by sharing as much knowledge as I could, for 
they were and are the future of pipe smoking!

Please add another shop to the resource list. It's a new shop in Michigan 
City, Indiana.
"The Golden Leaf"
232 W. Fourth Street. Michigan City, IN 46360

name is Phil.

Keep on puffin!

[ Thanks, Wayne!  Is the Golden Leaf a small chain?  There was a

<a name="27">Subject: What to drink</a>

Dear Steve,

Instead of writing a paper for an Art History class, I browsed over the
latest Pipes Digest and found that we (being the "pipies") haven't settled
on the perfect beverage to accompany a pipeful of tobak.  Since this debate
(?) seems like it will be around until there are no longer matches on the
face of the earth, I thought I'd add my two cents.  Some time back, someone
(the name escapes me) posted several times extolling the virtues of a tea
called lapsang suchon and its compatability with a pipe, especially one
filled with an English style blend.  Sounded interesting at the time, but I
dismissed it since I never thought I would run into such a blend of tea.
Wrong again.  Turns out, the stuff is more readily available than the
exotic name may suggest.  The tea has an unmistakeable smokey scent,similar
to some Scotches.  But, as any good pipey knows, the scent can be quite
different from the actual taste, and this is just the case.  Lapsang suchon
has a very smoky aroma, but the flavor of the tea is much more straight
forward- not bitter, and nearly sweet.  From my experience, it does
accompany an English blend quite well, and not being much of an aromatic
smoker myself, I think it may lend itself nicely to all but the sweetest of
aromatics.  The stuff isn't expensive at all, and is IMHO certainly worth a
go.  Check out your local coffee shop for the smoky stuff.  As a final
word, I prefer to enjoy fine Scotch and fine tobacco separately, as I would
hate to slight either of their deserved attention.
Happy puffing and sipping,
Patrick North

<a name="28">Subject: Meerschaum</a>

Steve --

Some etymological/geographical meanderings of possible interest to 
others......Meerschaum:

I must confess to having a fetish (some would say obsession!) with
origins.  This weekend, while puffing away on my Astley's meerschaum 
that my wife (with heavy hinting) gave me for Xmas, I had a spurt of 
interest in probing into the origin thereof.  As we all know, the word 
is German, "sea foam," apparently arising from the early notion that 
the material was compressed foam from the sea.  (Transliterally, the 
word is "ecume de mer" in French.)

Recently, I was browsing in Philip Eversberg's library at his shop, the
BAYOU HUMIDOR, in Baton Rouge.  From time to time, I delve into the book,
TOBACCO ENCYCLOPEDIA, edited by Ernst Voges (published in Germany by
Tobacco Journal International, 1984).  Voges says that, contrary to popular
belief, Meerschaum comes from the lingua franca (the old, mixed-tongue
trading lingo used betweeen the Mediterranean countries and the Eastern
states) word, "mertschavon."  -- Voges does not give any reference for
this assertion, so I don't know if his claim is reliable.

With piqued interest, I delved into my dear companion, the Oxford English
Dictionary.  The OED says that Meerschaum is a transliteration of the
Persian word, "kefidarya," meaning "foam of the sea" (no surprise!).
Now, I found in the OED a rare, obsolete minerology word, "keffekill,"
which is derived from the Persian "kefigil," meaning "foam of clay."
Also, the OED has an old minerology word, "keffekilite," defined as
"a greyish lithomarge found in the Crimea." -- As the geographical readers
of PD will be quick to note, the Crimea is a peninsular region in the
former USSR, protruding into the northern Black Sea (due north from Turkey,
whose northern part forms the Black Sea's southern shore).  Curiously,
there is a town in the Crimea called "Keffe."

We may never know the ultimate historical context of this wonderful stuff
we call Meerschaum!  One thing is certain:  It was well known (and used for
a variety of purposes, including *soap*) long before the time of the
famous legend of the Hungarian Count Andrassy's visit to Turkey -- and the
ensuing employment of Meerschaum for pipes by the aristocracy.  The Turks,
themselves, were probably using the mineral locally for pipes before the
ol' Count's trip. -- Voges, in the aforementioned Encyclopedia, states that
the Turkish word for Meerschaum is "luletashi," meaning "pipe stone."

Amongst this hodge-podge melting pot of information, I lean toward the
Persian association, since their influence in that region long preceded the
Ottoman Turkish period.

A coincidence regarding the Crimea...... The Crimean War in the 1850's
apparently played a significant role in exposing Europeans and British
taste buds to the delights of Turkish/Oriental tobaccos.  They were allied
with the Turks (against the Russians) during that war (e.g., see Carl
Ehwa's book).

I would be interested in additional information on the history of Meerschaum
from PD readers.

All for now,
Rickey Welch

                        I was just reading the latest issue of Pipe Digest
#208 ans came upon your letter you submitted after issue #207. In your
letter you speak about Kirsten pipes. I have several of them that I
purchased in my youth ( smile ). They have been well used I can tell you.
However a couple of them have to be repaired and when I tried to get them
repaired where I purchased them, I was informed that Kirsten had gons out of
business - even the 800 number I had written down doesn't work. You sound as
if you know of a new way to contact them. If you could help me out I would
be very grateful. Thank you - Jim McKinney Jr., 2065 Knox Road 850E, Wataga,

Steve,

[Administrativa deleted. -S.]

I've been reading PD for a few months now and I find it tremendously
interesting. Keep up the good work!

A note for those who are having trouble viewing the large filesize PD. Load
the file into a word processor instead of using your system text editor or
mail reader. Text editors are intended for the creation and editing of
small text files such as scripts or program code that is to be linked to
other code at compilation time. Larger documents are the domain of word
processors.

Any word processor should do. I have used both WordPerfect and ClarisWorks
on the Mac to read the digest. Currently, I am using WordPerfect because it
allows me to reformat the text with a macro. My macro removes the hard
carriage returns, changes the point size of the text for easier onscreen
reading and then adjusts the margins so that the text will fill my screen.
I will share this macro with anyone who is interested. It is not perfect
but is a good start.

I never print the PD. Whenever I run across an interesting entry, I simply
copy that text to a separate file and save it in an appropriate folder on
my disk. Thus I have folders relating to tobacco, pipe maintenance,
histories, shops and suchlike.

[ Thanks for the advice, Doug!  I'm sure many readers will find it
helpful. -S. ]

<a name="33">Subject: Lee Van Cleef</a>

Hi Steve,

Last Sunday I viewed the Sergio Leone film trilogy starring Clint Eastwood
and Lee Van Cleef on TNT.  Although I have seen these movies several times, I
continue to be struck by the pipe that Lee Van Cleef smoked in the second
movie "For a Few Dollars More."  It is  large, 3/4 bent, tan in color, and
appears to be a sandblast.  It seems to have an amber (or maybe bone) stem.
 What a pipe!

Have any readers seen a pipe like the one in the movie?  I'd like any
information (even anecdotal) regarding it.  Perhaps one of the large pipe
manufacturers put out a "Lee Van Cleef" model after the movie came out in
1966.  Maybe one of the custom pipe makers such as Alberto Bonfiglioli could
duplicate the pipe.

I wish I had taped the movies (they were shown in the letter-box format).  To
me, just the image of Van Cleef slowly and deliberately lighting that pipe,
makes the movie memorable.  He looks legit' smoking a pipe.  When I recently
saw the movie "Apollo XIII" I thought that a couple of the actors (smoking
brand new pipes!) looked a little phony.  Did anyone else think so?

pipe smokers, since he played the "heavy" in the spaghetti
Westerns. But he did indeed look like he knew what he was doing with

<a name="34">Subject:       S.G.'s Report</a>

Hello All,

I would like to enlist the help of our other _Pipes Digest_ readers in 
tracking down a document.

Recently, a letter in the _Pipes Digest_ contained a quote from 
the Surgeon General's report which may first have appeared in an 
installment of _Pipes Digest_ about a year ago.

The quote as used stated that pipe smokers have longer life 
expectancies than non-smokers.  The source was cited as: "Surgeon 
General's Report, Public Health Service Publication #1103, pp. 92 and 
112."

Unfortunately:

1.  The _Surgeon General's Report_ and the _Public Health Service 
Publication_ are *two* separate publications.  

2.  None of either publication have numbers like "1103", only 
dates of publication.  

I work in the George Mason University Library where we have many of 
the GPO documents and I would like to see the entire publication to 
read the text for myself.  

Can anyone offer a correction for the title, page numbers or other 
information for locating the said document and quote?

Many thanks for any help,

John

<a name="37">Subject: In Search of Clean Air</a>

I submitted a posting to the Pipes Digest in #206 asking about what
people do to keep the inside are odor-free during the winter months.
I thought I would share some of the responses which I received.

Ralph T. Webb highly recommends an aril called OZIUM which removes
odors from the air.  I bought some in the automotive section at K-Mart
to give it a try. A small spray can costs as much as a decent cigar!
I got about 4 night's use from the tiny can. Definitely clears up a
lot (but not all) of the smell.  I later found through the CompuServe
Wine forum that this product is available at warehouse clubs such as
Sam's Club in a BIG spray can which is much more economical. I'll
still use it, but only in the economy size.  Interesting note on
OZIUM; it contains Propylene Glycol, the same stuff used in Credos to
maintain a constant humidity in our humidors! OZIUM works by keeping
very fine droplets airborne for quite some time, which allows the
absorption of airborne stink particles, for lack of a better term.  I
suppose the PG doesn't evaporate like water would, so it does a better
job than just misting with water.  I read some people would mist with
plain water to _knock down_ the smoke. I would think you would have
smelly carpeting after the droplets settled.

I also tried _smoker's candles_ which are about 3 inched in diameter
with a small core of green stuff that melts with the wax and burns off
something to neutralize the smoke.  This did a tremendous job of
keeping the smoke and haze away. I had some friends over with 4 of
these candles going and after about 9 cigars, there was no smoke
hanging in the air.  However, the next morning it still smelled like
an ash tray in the house.  They helped, but like the OZIUM, did not
eliminate the smell completely.  Perhaps I should have left them
buring all night? I had to sprinkle the carpeting with Carpet Fresh
and really air the place out.  Unfortunately the temperature dropped
from a balmy 40 F to a chilly 10F that afternoon!

Yet another suggestion from the Compuserve forum was to place a bowl
of vinegar overnight in the room he smoked in.  I haven't tried it,
but one pipie said it worked great.  It has something to do with the
acid in the vinegar reacting with something in the smoke that was
alkiline, but I am not a chemistry expert.  I haven't tried it yet.  I
wonder if misting the air with vinegar would work?

My quest for clean smelling air at home has been greatly assisted by
the opening of a new tobacconist in Minnetonka, just a few miles out
of my way home from the office.  J.T. Tobacconist has a smoking lounge
with nice leather furnishings, dart boards, a very large humidor which
will soon contain lockers you may rent and a nice selection of
cigars. All the accessories you would need too, such as humidors,
cutters, lighters, ashtrays. Not being a pipe smoker (yet) I have not
really assessed the pipe collection, but there seems to be a range in
prices from $20 to over $100.  The pipe tobacco is in a dozen or so
jars on the counter. The owners, Jeff and Tim, are very nice and
support a great atmoshpere.  They are willing to give you assistance
in selecting smokes, but won't give unsolicited (read arrogant)
advise.  Great place to stop on the way home from work. There happens
to be a liquor store accross the street with a fine selection of
single-malts, and Jeff keeps a stock of paper cups on hand just in
case. :) If you stop in, let them know how you heard of them.

J.T. Tobacconist

<a name="38">Subject:       Re: Pipes Digest #208 -- January 14, 1996</a>

Dear Steve,
I just got to read PD#208 and found it very enjoyable and useful as 
usual.  I wonder if I could get a current issue of the Resource 
Guide?  I've just received some tobacco from a new Pipe Digest 
subscriber in Germany, and found it not only quite good but quite 
different from anything I have smoked.   Two of the blends are 
Lotzbect and Graf Luckner (Sea Devil).  There seems to be a slight 
flavor of what I have come to identify with Irish tobaccos ( and I 
wonder if anyone can identify that for me).  The Lotzbect Latakia 
Melange is even quite beautiful in the pouch, with a variety of textures and 
colors. I wonder if German tobaccos are available in the U.S., and if 
there are any German brands of pipes available as well.  I have never 
seen either for sale here, in many years of pipe smoking.  Which 
leads to another question: are there decent brands (not the work of 
individual carvers) of pipes produced in countries other than the 
ones generally associated with pipe production? I have an Israeli 
pipe with a bamboo shank I picked up at a pipe show, and I believe 
Alpha used to be produced there, but is now made in the U.S. (?)  
Perhaps some of your international coterie of subscribers could share 
some information about local pipes?  
BTW, in the same package with the German tobacco was a tin of Fox's 
Banker's Mixture, a product of James J. Fox &amp; Co. Ltd., of Dublin and 
London.  I had never heard of it before, and it was a wonderful 
treat. It is one of the best English (not Irish) type blends I have 
ever smoked.  Listed on the tin as "A Rich Medium Blend," I find the 
combination of full flavor and aroma coupled with a cool, mild smoke 
unique in my 35 years of smoking.  If I can part with some, I send it 
to Craig at Cornell &amp; Diehl and ask him to clone it for me.  I will 
be writing to Gawith-Hoggarth English Tobaccos, mentioned in #208, to 
see if it is available.  

The best to you and yours, and the rest of the sotweed fanciers,

Greetings, fellow lovers of The Leaf!

I was reading some of the back issues of the Digest (about 162, I
think the Fall of '94) and came across a posting from ???????@???.???.
He had humidor plans which he was willing to sell for $5 a pop.  I
tried to e-mail him regarding the offer and the message was bounced
back. Does anyone know of his whereabouts?  I would like to make a
humidor, and the plans were to have extensive how-to's on construction
techniques, so I thought it would helpful. He left a snail-mail
address which I am also trying: Chavete, PO Box 5561, Slidell, LA
70469.

Did anyone else on the list purchase the plans and make one of Chavete's 
humidors?

I have heard people asking about construction of humidors but I have
never seen much of a reply. I would think out of our readership of
close to 2000 that there would be some knowledgeable
smokers/woodworkers with some construction hints to share. I have read
the Humidor FAQ from Bob Curtis (if I recall correctly) and it had
some good info, but not a lot on construction techniques that I find
valuable.

<a name="40">Subject: Pipe Cleaning</a>

Steve, I thought I'd try a reply to Wayne Baker's query in the last
newsletter about pipe sweetener and refreshing pipes.  My feeling is that
one should refresh his (or her) pipes every six months or a year, depending
on how heavily you smoke them and how badly your tobacco tends to produce
gunk (i.e., aromatics). Wayne is correct--the commercial pipe sweetener is
expensive, and it's mostly alcohol anyway.  So get you a sufficient
quantity of the highest proof grain alcohol you can obtain.  Some states
still sell a high-proof drinking alcohol that's almost pure (Everclear, I
think it's called), although Ohio doesn't for some reason.  If you have to
get the alcohol with the poison in it that prohibits drinking, do it.
Everything is going to evaporate before you smoke the pipe again, so it
can't hurt you.
 
Ream your bowl down to the thickness of a nickel.  Start with the stem and
run alcohol-soaked bristly pipe cleaners through it until they come out
clean.  (You can wipe the cleaners off on a rag and keep reusing them.)
Then get a bunch of q-tips, soak them the ends in alcohol and clean out
that part of the shank before the air hole until the q-tips come out clean.
Then use bristly cleaners again to clean out the shank from the air hole
down to the bottom of the bowl (there must be technical terms for these
pipe parts, but I don't know them), again til they come out clean.
Finally, double a soft, thin pipe cleaner and insert it down the shank (so
the alcohol won't run out).  Fill the bowl with table salt and then, being
careful not to overfill (I use an eyedropper), fill the bowl with alcohol.
Let sit upright for 24 hours.  Dump out the dried, discolored salt, use the
doubled pipe cleaner to clean off the sides of the bowl, and blow through
the shank.  Repeat if the pipe still is sour, but this should do the trick.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

<a name="41">Subject: Meerschaum Pipes</a>

Dear Steve;
I am a newcomer to pipe smoking since October of 95. I have a 
"collection" of primarily Dr. Grabow drugstore Briar pipes. I currently 
have a total of five (5) briar pipes. Is there a lot of difference 
between drug store pipes and more exspensive pipes that I could buy at a 
pipe store?  Some pipe smokers tell me yes there is a difference others 
tell me I am wasting my money. The basic question is why spend 35-50 
dollars on a pipe when I can get a drugstore Dr. Grabow for 9-19 dollars? 
My biggest frustration with pipe smoking so far is the moisture build up 
or "gurgling" sound. Also do not enjoy having  liquid saliva come through 
the stem and into my mouth. I am thinking about getting purchasing a Dr. 
Grabow meerschaum lined bowl for 18.95 at a local drugstore. But I don't 
know if there would be much of a difference between smoking briar and 
smoking meerschaum lined bowls. Please advise. Perhaps a used estate 
meerschuam would be the way to go? Any advise you send me would be 
welcome If you want my mailing address I would be glad to send it to you 
in the next e-mail message. Have a nice day.

Hi Steve,

I've been really enjoying PD for sometime and have decided to see if maybe 
someone could help me.  First, I've been smoking a pipe for about 10 years, 
mostly high grades.  Thanks to PD, I don't feel alone in this pipeless world. 

I have two questions in particular.  If anyone would like to email me a 
response, please feel free.

Some years ago, in traveling around the southwest I came across the most 
wonderful Nording.  It was a flame grain that had a wonderfully carved Lucite 
bit and a beautiful straight grain.....I should have purchased it but for one 
reason or another, I didn't.  Well.....years later I still dream of this pipe 
and I can't seem to find anyone who can help me.  It cost (at the time) about 
$300.00.  I know I can order a freehand or straght grain from Nording, but 
this particular style was wonderful!

The other question is:  Has There been any new publications done by Richard 
Carlton Hacker?  A friend of mine was reading my old copy of The Ultimate 
Pipe Book and asked me if there was anthing new by him.  My friend found his 
writing so enjoyable that he now wants to start smoking a pipe. (more power 
to him!).

One additional comment, someone had mentioned in one of the last issues about 
a new "smoke shop" in Scottdale, Arizona called the Village Smoke Shop.  
Well, I visited Craig Cooper and found his shop to be wonderful.  He is new, 
and has a limited selection, but it is growing and he is willing to order 
anything.  He is funny and well natured and created a wonderful atmospher!  I 
truly enjoyed spending time in his shop.  So THANKS! for the suggestion!  I 
found myself in Washington D.C. this Christmas and was determined to visit 
one of my favorite locations, the GeorgeTown Tab., But they nolonger seem 
interested in serving the Pipe Smokers of the world, so its nice to find a 
new "Smoke shop" in my local area that does enjoy having the pipe smokeing 
population around!

Love the PD Steve, thanks for the hard work!

Dear Steve, 

I spent a long time looking at your Web page today and was most
impressed.  You really have pulled together some really useful
information and it has illustrated to me just how good a web page can
be .

I notice that you have a commercial section and I wondered if there is
any way that our Quality tobacco catalog might be listed therein. Our
catalog is simply a text file which contains around 150 tobaccos that
we supply mail order worldwide.  ( Current copy attached for your
information ).By the way, you may be interested to learn that we are
about to add a cigar section to our mail order list which will contain
some 200 Continental, Dominican, Honduran and Cuban cigars.

Our postings in the Pipes Digest and OoOps have resulted in hundreds
of enquiries and we are now supplying tobacco on a regular basis to
the USA as a result.  Judging by the reaction of these discerning
fellows I have little doubt that other pipesmokers would enjoy reading
our catalog and would down load it if it were more readily available.

I have considered my own Web page but apart from my own catalog I
could only put up a poor imitation of The Pipes Digest page, and there
is little point in doing that .If there is any way that I could
actively participate in your page I would be most happy to do so. I
could for example act as a source of information re: English tobaccos
( I have been doing this in response to enquiries already received ) .
Perhaps you have some thoughts on this ?

I hope you don't me asking Steve

Yours sincerely

Currently I own four pipes, two of which I smoke regularly. The first is a 
eight bent apple-shaped bulldog with an oval shank and saddle bit. The 
second is the classic straight 'Dad' pipe with a tapered bit. My first ever 
pipe, sadly, hangs on the wall, never to be smoked again. It's a half bent 
three/quarter egg shape, with a really thin military bit. The top has an 
attached spark arrester (lid), and is also lined on the inside with a sheet 
metal of some kind. It was given to me by the man I new as my Grandfather 
(my real paternal Grandfather was killed in or near Stalingrad. All the 
family got back was his wedding ring, his paybook, and an Iron Cross, First 
class with Oak Clusters. No explanation, no other apparent survivors in the 
Regiment to tell what happened.) It was in  the back yard of my 
Grandmother's home in Hamburg, among the apple trees on a beautiful summer's 
after-noon after weeding the tree nursery. I was smoking Drum at the time, 
and he offered to get me started on the pipe. The stem has broken twice now, 
and it's no longer worth repairing. It's been on and off between cigarettes 
and pipes since then, but I think the pipe has finally won after these last 
two months. I even got the point once of throwing out almost all my pipes 
eight years ago, a move that I now regret . I miss my blond sand-blasted 
bulldog. Sniff, sniff.

At the moment I'm smoking mostly Cavendishes (vanilla, black, and cherry), 
and Erinmore flake. I too am still searching for the ultimate smoke, and 
have determined to work my way through every jar in the local tobacconist's 
store.

Now enough about me. Here are my questions:

First question - when my brother came back from India several years ago, he 
brought along a stone pipe. With the exception of the elephants head carved 
on the side, it is a symmetrical column. The over-all effect is one a long, 
skinny tea-cup, with the elephant's trunk forming the handle. There is no 
shank, and the smoke hole is at the bottom of the pipe. The bowl is unusual 
in the there is a 3/16" gap along the bottom of the bowl were the floor 
meets the wall, all the way around. Now, my question is: Is the a museum 
piece, a tourist's trinket, and how would I smoke it if I wanted to? I 
imagine that the pipe would be inserted perpendicular to a hollow bamboo 
piece, closed and one end, and smoked this way. Otherwise I would have to 
tilt my head back at a ninety degree angle to get at the smoke and avoid 
spilling ashes.

Second question - I have an 'alte mode' or Tyrolean pipe handed down to me 
from the afore-mentioned 'grandfather'. Unfortunately, between there and 
here, it has been used as a decoration, dropped, glued back together 
(several times), and is no longer smokable. Its one of those porcelain 
jobbies in four pieces: a large bowl with a metal lid, a U-shaped bottom, a 
long straight bamboo tube, and a mouthpiece. The bowl is decorated with a 
hunting scene. My brother (the same one who was in India) has promised to go 
cruising through the tobacconists of the Black Forest and price a new one 
out for me (he is currently doing a Masters in Architecture at the 
University of Heidleberg) in exchange for some stuff from the Mountain 
Equipment Co-op. The question is, assuming that I get my hands on one of 
these babies - how do I smoke it? Does it need to be packed in a certain 
way? Does it need to be re-lit more often? Or should I just smoke the damn 
thing and let you guys know? I imagine it would be a nice, long, cool smoke 
(if a bit wet), good for a cold winter evening in front of the VCR.

Third and last question - has anyone out there had any luck mail ordering 
tobacco internationally or inter-provincially. I'm wondering (although I 
doubt it) if one can get stuff mailed from outside the country for personal 
use, and avoid paying some or all provincial and/or federal tariffs 
(legally, of course). Or if ordering tobacco from one province (Ontario, 
say) to another (Alberta, say) and avoid some or all of the provincial 
tariffs (legally, for personal use, of course).

Thanks again, Steve for all the effort you've put into this mail group. I 
certainly appreciate it, and I'm sure many others do as well. Next time: a 
report of tobacconists in Calgary, Winnipeg, and Regina.

Cheers,
Bernie May

[Interesting on the stone pipe, Bernie!  I'd say go ahead and try it
out if you'd like. Will defer the other questions to our readers with
experience, but we'd be glad to hear of the results! -S.]

Dear Steve, 

I've been smoking cigars now for a couple of years, and I must admit that 
when I can afford them, they are my true passion.  However, I am a college
student and cigars are expensive so last year I tried a pipe.  Very different,
but very pleasureable, too.  I do not know anything about pipes (briar?, 
meerschaum?, cake?, etc.) but I would like to learn.  Ive found that asking 
local tabaconists usually only results in a sales pitch.  Where is best to 
pick up on these things?  Is there some comprehensive book for beginers?
I don't even know the finer points of actually smoking my pipe.  Where can I
learn?
Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated.

			Thanks!

Hi Steve,

Once again I must say that your dedication to the pipes digest is greatly
appreciated by all that you serve.  Thanks...

James "BriarPipes" Lawson said:

&gt;I continue to be struck by the pipe that Lee Van Cleef smoked in the second
&gt;movie "For a Few Dollars More."  It is  large, 3/4 bent, tan in color, and
&gt;appears to be a sandblast.  It seems to have an amber (or maybe bone) stem.
&gt; What a pipe!

I was very intrigued with it myself and had some of the same reactions,
such as: 

&gt;I wish I had taped the movies (they were shown in the letter-box format).  To
&gt;me, just the image of Van Cleef slowly and deliberately lighting that pipe,
&gt;makes the movie memorable.  He looks legit' smoking a pipe. 

I also thought that Van Cleef was either A) a real life pipesmoker or B) did
some very good rehearsing because he looked very natural.

What I'm hoping is that there is a PD reader who has a way of getting a
video frame into a .GIF or .JPG file -- Also, I've often thought of putting
a page up off my homepage (which is under very slow construction right now
at www.cris.com/~jcjewell) that is dedicated to pictures and .AVI or .MOV
files of famous people or movie clips of pipe smoking.  I need to start
keeping track of who I see and where I see them, though.  Another movie that
I saw not long ago, I don't remember the name of it, but it had Bryan
Denehey (sp?) in it as Leslie Groves, the military officier in charge of the
Manhattan project.  Many of the nuclear scientists smoked pipes.  I suppose
it was much more common then (that was before my time :)

If there would be an interest in seeing such a collection of pipe pictures
and video clips, and other PD readers had some things to contribute, I'd do
the HTML work and put it up.  Write me:

????????@????.???

--Jeff "Charlie" Jewell

[ I believe that the movie about the A-bomb was titled "Fat Man and Little
Boy." Don't remember that Groves smoked a pipe, but Oppenheimer definitely
did. Excellent picture, BTW. -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Actors and Pipe Smoking</a>

In the last digest I heard mention briefly of the notion that many times 
actors are playing a character who smokes a pipe, but he does not have 
the knowledge of how to realistically smoke a pipe.  I too have noticed 
this quite often.  Lee Van Cleef (mentioned last time) was either an 
excellent actor or he really knew and enjoyed smoking a pipe for his 
portrayal was realistic.  Watson seemed a more sincere pipe smoker than 
Sherlock himself in the black and white films from the 40's... even in 
television it is easy to spot.... If any of you watched Simon &amp; Simon in 
the 80's, Gerald McRaney's character was far a far more realistic in 
using a pipe as a disguise (realistically) than was the actor who played 
his brother on the show.  They would regularly don pipes or cigars as a 
part of an undercover disguise.  It was easy to see Gerald McRaney knew 
his way around a briar or cigar, whereas the other one did not.
  
I guess I am just mentioning I also notice the true pipe smokers in the 
movies and tv.... and I look at them favorably.  The poor imposters... 
those that go through the motions in a contrived manner... actually 
detract from a flim or show and distract me.  I wonder if anyone else 
notices this same situation?

<a name="6">Subject: Irish tobacco by Mullingars</a>

(Steve, This is meant to be a post to the Digest -- have I sent it to
the right address?)

In PD 209, someone was asking about tobacco blends from Ireland.  Many
years ago I bought a few tins of tobacco from Ireland, by a company
called Mullingars.  I don't remember the name of the blend, but it
wasn't "Irish Mead" (which is (was?) also made by Mulingars).   I really
enjoyed the tins, but have never been able to find it again.  Does
anyone know anything about Mulingars -- if they are still in business,
and how they might be reached?

Thanks for any info ...

From: "Van B. Adams" &lt;??????@????????.???&gt;
<a name="7">Subject:       Submission for PD:  Try the Drugstore Brands!!!</a>

If you are like me, you don't have memories of adults smoking 
Dunhills with fine English blends of Latikia, Virginias, and  
Orientals, spiced with Perique.  No,  I  recall all those guys 
in the barber shop with their Dr. Grabows , Medicos, and if they were 
really fancy, Kaywoodies,,, puffing away on Prince Albert, Velvet, Half 
and Half, Carter Hall, and Sir Walter Raleigh.  There were so many 
brands of pipe tobacco, most still being sold.  I still see Granger, 
Our Advertiser, Field and Stream, Revelation, Kentucky Club, and 
Middleton's Cherry Blend for sale in the supermarkets, along with 
other old "standards".   You can still find the boards of cheap 
laquered pipes, and here in Missouri the Missouri Meerschaum factory 
still churns out several million corn cobs each year.  Can all the 
people that use those cheap pipes and smoke that cheap tobacco know 
something we don't?

I know the "drugstore brands" lack sophistication and character.  I 
realize that the accomplished pipester would never smoke them in the 
company of folks who "know" about pipes.  But, just like a blond 
cheerleader and a Z-28 are a LOT of fun, although not at all classy, 
a corn cob and a bowl of Half and Half is a great smoke!!!

So, when no one is looking, I sneak some cheap tobacco in the cart at 
the supermarket.  I even have a few Medicos with the FILTERS hidden 
away from the pipes I show to my friends.  And sometimes, when no one 
is looking, I kick back with a cheap pipe and smoke the brands I used 
to see when I was a little boy in the barbershop.

It's a lot of fun, except Prince Albert doesn't come in a pocket tin 
anymore.  Imagine that, no more "Prince Albert in a can" jokes.  
Another piece of Americana gone.  But Velvet still comes in the can.

So go ahead, slum a little.  Nobody at the pipe shop needs to know.  

Van Adams

[ Indeed, Van!  Craig Tarler also related a story to me about a show he
attended, at which a group of "macho English smokers" bought up his stock
of Apricots and Cream.  And Prince Albert still does come in a can; I think
the 16-ounce size. Hasn't anyone let him out yet? :-) -S.]

<a name="8">Subject: Kabik Pipes</a>

Steve, you'll probably get hundreds of replies to the letter in # 209 about
Kabik pipes, but I'll add what I know.  I can't imagine having one and not
being able to sell or give it away--perhaps that was a joke.  Anyway,
Michael Kabik is a noted American pipemaker of long standing.  He started
his Sven-Lar line in the mid-70s, which are the ones marked "Skulptur by
Kabik."  All these that I have seen are beautiful pipes.  They often (or
usually--I'm not sure) came with their own pipe rest carved from a block of
briar.  Often, in fact, there is a two-pipe set resting in a carved briar
block and facing different
directions.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

<a name="9">Subject: (1) Information re.: KABIK ; (2) DRUG STORE PIPES</a>

1. Michael V. Kabik a pipe maker for some 17 years when listed in DIRECTORY
OF AMERICAN PIPEMAKERS in 1987. Among the pipe brands for which he crafted
are: CHP-X PIPES, KANE, GRAN-HILL, TOBAK LTD., SVEN-LAR, DANE CRAFT, WENHALL
PRESIDENTIALS, SCULPTUR, and his own name.

2. DRUG STORE PIPES
    A subscriber wants to know if there's a difference between his Dr. Grabow
drug store pipes and more expensive ones. He then goes on to answer his own
question, perhaps unknowingly, when he complains about the moisture build-up
and "gurgling" sound when he smokes his Dr Grabows. The difference of course
is that the cheap drug store pipes are made from the interior of the briar
burl which is dense and relativeatly grain free.Consequently it doesn't
absorb moisture like the outer surface of the burl (plateau) which is
lightweight, porous and beautifully grained. It's the latter that's used for

  Hi Steve... two questions for you:

  1. Just saw "Hot Shots: Part Deux" on TV last night. In once scene, Lloyd
Bridges is smoking a pipe. He also smoked a pipe in "Joe Versus The
Volcano". Is Lloyd a true pipesmoker or was he acting??

  2.  Does Walter Cronkite still smoke a pipe and if so, what blend does he
smoke? (I threw a message in the a.s.p but never got a reply)

Thanks in advance, talk to you soon...   John

Dear Steve, et al;

I'd like to put my two cents worth on a couple of questions.  In response to
Morris Acevedo's question about calabashes (calabashi?, calabi?), they are
$57 for a small and $65 for a large in my area.  To Chris Bolstad's question
about Alphas, I own two of the Israeli Alphas.  They are passably good pipes
but, IMHO, I'd rather buy a GBD for less money.  My understanding is that
they are now being made by Sparta of Dr Grabow fame.  The Israeli Alpha's
I've seen are usually fanciful and I think that is their appeal.  I paid $30
each for the ones I have. For those asking about Condor, I recently
purchased a box of six pouches from JR (@15 dollars).  I bought it at their
store, but they may also carry it mail order.  It is, btw, very good tobacco.

Smokingly yours,

Phil Cunningham

<a name="14">Subject: SG report</a>

In the last PD, a librarian asked about the Surgeon General's report which
notes that pipesmokers live longer than nonsmokers. The report is:

Public Health Service. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Smoking and health: report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General
of the Public Health Service. Washington, DC: US Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, 1964; DHHS publication
no.(PHS)64-1103.

It's long out of print, but should be in a good library if not stolen
(common), lost or defaced by anti-tobacco "researchers." The chapter
referenced is Chapter 8, which deals with mortality rates. The quotes often
seen online from this report are rarely accurate verbatim quotes. However,
the general sense of the "quotes" is correct. This report (and later ones
from the SG which more thoroughly address pipe and cigar smoking) should
give any pipe smoker considerable comfort. Having read all the reports, it
is clear to me that pipe smoking has risks, but significant health risks
are not among them.

Someone plainly needs to put these reports on the net. They are public
documents produced by the feds with tax dollars. I have decent scans of
relevant portions of 64-1103. Might also have portions of the 1979 report
on pipes and cigars. If someone is willing to put these up on the Web, I'll
contribute the scans. They really belong on the Pipes Digest page.

Dear Steve and PD readers,
       
        Thank you for what you have done with the Digest. I have only
recieved three issues, but each was printed and read over many times by my
friends.  I am 23 years old and have been smoking a pipe for about 5 years
now (I come from a long line of pipe smokers).  I collect mostly Savinelli's
and smoke cavindish blends (but I like to try different tobaccos
occasionally). I have many friends that enjoy pipes now, most of which I
converted from cigars or cigarettes when we were in High School (I bought my
best friend a meerschaum for Christmas, and Christmas was good!).

        The reason that I am writing is that a new cigar shop has opened
here in town, they specialize in rare and hard to find cigars.  I've been in
several times because they keep threatening to unpack a bunch of Dunhills.
The manager, Bill, is interested in ordering some pipe tobaccos from Europe
and employed my help in acquiring a few resources.  1) We are looking for
addresses for shops in European locals from which we may obtain high quality
tobacco. 2) We are also looking for someone in Fresno, the Bay Area, and/or
California to do repair work/refurbishing/manufacturing of pipes. Top dollar
will be paid for quality craftsmanship. Please send any reply to my address
listed below.

Thank you in advance for any and all assistance.

<a name="21">Subject: Digest submission - Smoking Large Pipes</a>

SMOKING LARGE PIPES 

I am sending in this article for those who are interested in smoking very large
pipes.  By magnum, I mean an internal bowl size of 1-1/4" or larger, and a bowl
height of 3" or higher. 

Smoking Magnum size pipes is a little bit different than smoking conventional
size pipes.  The bowl is a lot bigger, the air passage through the shank and
bit should be bigger, and they are heavier.  Each of these attributes make a
difference in the way that the pipes are smoked and enjoyed. 

When packing the bowl full of tobacco, start filling the pipe loosely until it
is half full, then lightly pack with the fingers until it is lightly springy.
Continue to fill the bowl to the top by pushing down more firmly so that the
surface of the tobacco is slightly firm.  Top off the bowl if necessary,
because the large size of the bowl allows for a lot of compaction, and the
finished cake of tobacco in the bowl may have sunken half an inch or more in
the final packing procedure. 

Blow from the bowl end of the pipe to clear out small bits of tobacco that may
have found their way into the shank area of the airway.  Blow from the bit end,
then suck air in through the bit to see if the draw is adequate.  If you have
packed too tightly, the draw will be difficult.  Empty the pipe with a pipe
tool into your pouch and try again.  If the bowl is packed too tightly, the
draw will be too slow and if packed too lightly, it will smoke too hot and the
tobacco will sink down dramatically when you tamp during smoking.  One of the
most attractive features of a super oversized pipe is the freedom of air
(smoke) movement through the pipe.  This is referred to as the "draw". 

After the pipe is packed, you are ready to light up.  I suggest a butane pipe
lighter such as a Colibri clip lighter.  Matches are too slow and cumbersome
for wide bowls, just be careful not to scorch the top edge of the bowl with
your lighter.  Zippos are fine, but they do leave a lighter fluid taste behind.
They also have a slower moving flame which requires a great deal of suction to 
pull the flame down into the tobacco.  If you have no problem with either one 
of these characteristics, then a Zippo is fine.  In windy locations, a Zippo is 
the only lighter that will stay lit - the Zippo pipe lighter is good under 
these situations.  

Begin by holding the pipe so that the bowl is vertical, not tipped forward or
to the side.  Holding the lighter in one hand and the pipe in the other, hold
the flame over the surface of the tobacco and begin puffing in with the cheeks,
holding the bit right at your lips.  The flame should be pulled straight down
into the tobacco.  Move the flame over the surface of the tobacco and scorch
the entire surface.  The tobacco will puff up and curl. Tamp the surface of the
tobacco lightly and make it level again.  This procedure usually needs to
repeated two more times before the entire surface of the tobacco is a bright
orange glow.  At this time, you can slow down and start smoking normally.  Big
bowls will take more tamping to get them going properly, because the tobacco
tends to curl up more when the bowl is a large diameter. Big pipes also take
more puffing than a smaller one to get completely lit. 

If you have never inhaled on your pipe before, try holding the pipe in your
teeth and breathe normally through your mouth so that you get a gentle stream
of smoke with each breath.  For a beginner, you should not try to inhale any
deeper right away.  Wait until this level of smoking feels comfortable before
you go any farther.  Tamp the tobacco when the smoke seems to get weaker.
Tamping is required when the top layer of tobacco ash is light and gray
colored.  Experience will indicate when tamping is required by the way the pipe
draws and the way the smoke tastes.  Do not press too hard, or the tobacco cake
will be overly compressed and will not pass the smoke through properly. 

Large pipes do not get as wet on the bottom as smaller ones do.  The wide bowl
size and greater surface of burning tobacco seems to vaporize a lot of the
water in contrast to a smaller pipe.  Use a long pipe cleaner through the end
of the bit all the way to the bottom of the bowl.  Use a twisting motion if
necessary to work it all the way down.  10-12 inch pipe cleaners are not
uncommon and are indispensable for big pipe smoking. 

After you have become accustomed to inhaling the light stream of smoke,  try
sealing up the lips a little more so that you get more smoke and less air.
Experiment with this for a while until you are able to take in a short blast of
smoke, then open the lips and top off the breath with air.  Exhaling through
the nose will increase the contact area for the smoke, and thus increase the
amount of smoke products that you absorb.  This will also create a different
feel than exhaling through the lips. 

As you become more familiar with this smoking technique, you can try increasing
the smoke to air ratio until you achieve a very pleasant warm feeling in the
chest as you smoke.  You can either inhale continuously with a constant
smoke/air mixture while you have the pipe in your teeth, or you can inhale a
burst of smoke followed by a topping off of air.  You may want to try holding
the pipe in your hand and pulling in the smoke using your cheeks as you inhale
as if you were lighting the pipe.  You can use this technique in lighting your
pipe as well. 

Some of the largest magnums almost require that you inhale while lighting the
pipe so that enough air gets through the pipe, otherwise, the tobacco may not
get completely lit evenly.  After you are comfortable with this, you can light
the pipe while it is in your teeth simply by inhaling forcefully while you
circle the lighter above the tobacco. 

Smoke the pipe down to 1/4 of the bowl, but no further.  The bottom of the 
tobacco has served as a filter and has accumulated a lot of excess bitterness.  
When you reach that point, is is best to switch to another pipe and let this 
one rest for a while.  If you do not have time to finish the whole bowl, rubber 
pipe covers are available that fit very well into 1.25" diameter bowls.  Just 
tamp and push one into the top of the bowl.  This will prevent smouldering and
spilling of ash.  For wider pipe bowls, have your pipemaker make a tapered plug
of briar resembling a bottle stopper. 

Magnum size pipes are heavier than normal pipes, so you will need to become
accustomed to the extra weight in your teeth.  The very largest of pipes are
not very practical for carrying around and are probably best enjoyed while
seated.  Of course with enough determination, you can do just about anything,
so if you really want to smoke your biggest pipes away from home, get busy and
practice! 

When you have become accustomed to smoking your larger size pipes, you will 
begin to appreciate the richness of the smoke and the greater satisfaction of 
the higher smoke volume that they produce.  Each pipefull lasts longer too,
so you can enjoy smoking longer without having to reload or switch to another 
pipe.

<a name="23">Subject: re: German pipe brands</a>

Dear Spencer,

   There are indeed decent brands that come from Germany, but not many, 
that is only two, as far as I know. One of them is *Vauen*. The 
history of the name is quite interesting. At the end of the 19th 
century two remarkable manufacturers of briar pipes located in 
Nuernberg (Ziener &amp; Ellenberger and Gebhard Otto) were left. They 
joined in 1901 and formed the "Vereinigte Pfeifenfabriken Nuernberg" 
(united pipe factories Nuernberg). The abreviated name "V.N." was 
vocalized to "Vauen" (German spelling of the letters) in 1911.
   The second one is *Oldenkott*. They were, along with Vauen, the 
most important manufacturers of briar pipes in the 1950ies, when 
increasing whealth allowed a market for luxury goods again, producing 
mostly pipes in the so called English style. The factory is situated 
in Rees.
   One problem about export and availability are the differences in smoking 
habits. After the publication of the Terry-report in 1964, the 9mm 
coal-filled filters for pipes became so popular in Germany that
 by now almost 90 per cent of the pipes sold in Germany are 9mm's. 
As a result, Vauen (who first patented the coal filter system in 1934) 
produce exclusively 9mm filter pipes by now. They really have 
significant advantages: 50 per cent less tar, 65 per cent less 
nicotine and a dry smoke (the paper tube absorbes the moisture).
   I've been told, that smokers in other European countries and the 
U.S. prefer filterless pipes or the 4-6mm paper rolls. That might be 
a reason, why the *excellent* (as well beautiful as smooth smoking) pipes 
made by Vauen are so little known abroad. If you're interested in 
contacting them, I'll check out the adress. 

With thanks to our benefactor Steve for his magnificent work,

Dirk Bahlo.

Good Evening Steve ...

        I'm looking for some information on the process of pressing tobacco 
and types of casing.
        Last fall, I had a real good crop of tobacco (about 100lbs) and up 
till now I've been spritzing whatever I was going to use with a liquour to 
bring up the moisture content and then running it through a blender. Sounds 
crude but it works well. However, I read an article that stated some of the 
tobacco companies case their product with whiskey, liquours, and/or other 
chemicals and then press the tobacco for about a month. During this 
time,heat is applied and a type of fermentation takes place.
        Well, to make a long story short, I've built a press and heat source 
etc,etc. and now I'm stuck. Has anybody in the group had anything to do with 
this type of process? I need to know how much pressure and how much heat. 
The article I read gave a time frame of about a month but they weren't to 
specific. What types of casing are being used?
        I tried to track down the author of the article but to no avail. I 
don't mind experimenting a little bit but I'd hate like hell to lose a large 
quantity of tobacco.
        If anyone has information on this they can e-mail me direct so it 
doesn't take up valuable space in the Digest. BTW ... Hats off to you for 
the terrific job you do on the digest. It's the best in my book and I really

Thanks for refering me to Steve Beaty, he has very Kindly put our catalog

I have received a lot of enquiries about Old English tobaccos. One that has 
cropped up a lot is Ogdens Readbreast Flake, so I thought everyone might
like to know what Ogdens had to say about this.

Readbreast Flake was last produced in the early 60's. The nearest comparable
tobaccos are  Ogdens BK Flake ( LOOSE ) which used to be known as Bulwark
and Ogdens Walnut  Flake in 50gm packs. Of these Walnut Flake is the first
choice.

Personally I prefer Bulwark which is Black and strong, burns very slowly
and has a wonderful "Old Fashioned" aroma. Both are available from our
catalog.

Steve,

I recently posted some questions on Nording pipes and wanted to thank the 
readers of PD for thier help!  I usually wouldn't post again so soon, however 
something very disturbing happened this weekend.

I am a buisness owner here in Phoenix, Az.  As usual, I spent the day 
Saterday at work.  My birthday is coming soon, and I had decided to purchase 
a present for myself.  Needless to say, it was a pipe, some tobacco, and 
other assesories that where long overdue.  I asked my wife if she could stop 
at one of my preferred "smoke shops" and purchase the goodies.  She was 
shopping with one of her friends and said that she would be happy to stop 
for me.  (She's the best!)  When she arrive at "Ye Olde Pipe &amp; Tobacco 
Shoppe" on 2115 E.Camelback, Phoenix, Az.  It was moderatly crowded. (as is 
the norm on saterday). She went to the counter, to recieve some help in 
purchasing my new goodies.  This is where it gets disturbing.

Of the several (so called "Gentlemen") working there, they would not serve 
her.  She asked for help several times, however, they seemed more interested 
in helping only the "men" that came into the shop.  She remained in the store 
for 10 minutes and could not recieve any help from the store personel.  This 
is after many "men" had entered the store after her and where immediatly 
served.  My wife, (for good reason) left in anger at the treatment she had 
recieved.

My wife is not easily angered.  When I returned home, she told me the story 
of how she had been discriminated against.  I normally would have taken her 
word for it, but I couldn't believe my ears, so I called her friend to find 
out what had happened.  To my horror and discust, my wife's story was true, 
except that she had waited 15 minutes before leaving the retched place.

This type of treatment is outrages and unforgivable!  Not only has "Ye Olde 
Pipe &amp; Tobacco" lost a $400 sale, I WILL NEVER SHOP THERE AGAIN!  I will make 
sure that I tell all the people I meet of the terrible treatment that 
"females" recieve there.  As a member of several buisness organizations in 
Arizona, I will tell this story to every single one of them!

It is unfortunate that women should recieve such treatment as a lower-class 
citizen when entering a place.  It is unforgivable that it also happened to 
be a "Smoke shop".  I have had wonderful experiences at the other shops I've 
been to in this country, and I am shocked that it ever happened at all.  My 
wife has gone to a tobaccanist several times for me when I couldn't make it. 
 This is the first time she has ever been treated this way.

A note to "Smoke Shops".  Customer service is your buisness (as is mine).  No 
matter if the customer is a "male", "female", "black", "white", "red", 
"purple", or from another planet. 

I've enjoyed the friends that I have meet at "Smoke Shops" and will continue 
to meet new friends.  Thanks to all the customer oriented shops, I will be 
HAPPY to do buisness with you!

Hello, Steve,

  Because I was planning a short 2-day trip to Phoenix this last weekend, I
went back to Digest #207 and re-read Joyce Perry's reviews of local pipe
shops.  As a result, on Saturday I stopped in at Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco
Shop.  Although it's a relatively small shop, they had a very nice
selection of both pipes and cigars from low to high end.  The salespeople
were all very friendly and knowledgeable and were very pleased when I told
them that I read about them in the Digest.

  While there I picked up a very nice freehand carved by a local pipemaker
named DeJarnett.  It's a solid, rugged-looking piece, but is surprisingly
lightweight for its size.  It was also very reasonably priced.  I'm not the
judge of wood that some of our fellow readers are, but I've seen pipes of
comparable size and quality that sold for 2 to 3 times as much.  Apparently
Mr. DeJarnett has been honing his skills for awhile and has only recently
begun to offer his pipes for sale via this retail outlet.  I had an
opportunity to smoke it last night and it was a delight--and it will only
get better with age and seasoning.

  I also bought a couple ounces of the shop's "House Blend."  It's a
lightly aromatic blend with some Latakia thrown in.  I found it to be quite
pleasant.  It's light in body, but is full of flavor with a hint of
sweetness that isn't overpowering like some aromatics can be.  It stayed
lit with little fuss and burned cool all the way down.

  Anyway, residents of and travelers to Phoenix looking for a good,
friendly tobacco shop could do a lot worse than trying out Ye Olde Pipe and
Tobacco.  I understand they will soon be moving into larger quarters within
the same shopping complex and so I look forward to visiting them again to
see what they do with the extra space.  I don't know if Joyce sent you the
particulars to add this shop to the Resource Guide.  If not here they are
(sorry, I don't know the zip code):

  Ye Olde Pipe &amp; Tobacco Shop
  Town &amp; Country Shopping Center
  2115 E. Camelback Rd.
  Phoenix, AZ
  (602) 955-7740

--Ed

[ I haven't received anything about them from Joyce.  Given Jason's wife's
experience, it isn't hard to see a possible reason why not. I will list
them in the Guide, but with the following notation: "Caveat: reported
discrimination against women customers."

If anyone in the shop wishes to address this matter, please take it up
directly with Jason and his wife.  I'll drop the caveat at such time as
they ask me to. -S. ]

Hi Steve,

Just wanted to let you know that I enjoy all the info from the digest, give
yourself a pat on the back for all the good work.

Also, I have discovered two new smoking support home pages you might want to
tie links to or at least let everyone else known about. The first is call
Friends of Tobacco (FOT), they are pretty politically oriented towards
notifying members about new laws which affect smokers and ways to state your
concerns to your Senator and such. Their URL is: www.fuji.com/fot. 

If nothing else, their worth taking a look at.

The second one is the South American Pipe Club. Similar to PD but based in
Brasilia, Brazil. A good link to unite us world wide. I have joined SAPC and
became a charter member by being one of the only two North Americans to join. 

Considering the changing time and antagonistic attitude smokers must deal
with today, supporting another group of Pipies couldn't hurt.

Finally, would it be possible to add a section to the directory for pipe
making supplies??. You could start by adding the following two:

American Smoking Pipe Co.
HC 88 Box 223
30 Tall Oaks Terrace
Pocono Lake, Pa. 18347

Stemco-Pimo, Inc
Butternut Lane
P.O. Box 2043
Manchester, Vt 05255

I've have looked far and wide to try and find some kind of supplier to
attempt my hand at making a pipe or two, I spent more time just trying to
find a supplier then it will probable take me to make the pipe.........

Thanks and Good Smoking

HELP ME!!

I am a student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.  Needless
to say there is not an abundance of good tobacco stores around.  I saw a
posting for Gawith Hoggarth British Tobaccos a few Digests ago and I wrote
to them and recieved a catalog.  On the menu (of very fine tobaccos!!) I
saw a tobacco called Latakia.  I think I have some of that blended in with
some other tobacco I bought at my home in Dallas, Texas.  The tobacconist
in Dallas told me it was a very strong blend that was treated in Syria (under
camel dung??)  It sounds crazy, but that's what I remember him telling me.
Steve, please tell me (if you can) a little more about this tobacco because
I like it a lot.  Thanks!

I was wondering if anyone has information about the areas of the world 
that have the highest percentage of pipe smokers?  
  
I was under the impression that at least until the 80's that pipe smoking 
was a very widespread habit in men of both Poland and Ireland.  Are there 
places in the world where pipe smoking is more common in men than is 
cigarette smoking or cigar smoking?  
  
Also.... does anyone know if Lech Walesa (electrician, prior president of 
Poland) is still a pipe smoker?  I do not recall seeing any photos of him 
while president that showed tobacco use.  I was curious if he is still a 
kindred spirit or if he has quit the habit?

     This shop is located close to where the cruise ships dock.  He only
sells one brand of cigars.  But, he makes these cigars himself (and you can
watch).  So, it is interesting.
If in San Juan, pay him a visit.

Steve,

Thanks for processing my subscription to Pipes Digest.  I have two questions
that maybe the readers can answer:

During the mid-1970s I frequented a pipe shop in Lexington, KY.  It was
owned by Bob Vie (a retired Marine, I believe).  I still remember his name
because it is on a line of Savinelli seconds that he sold as "Bob Vie
Matts."  I still have the ones I bought then and they are still some of my
favorites.  Does anyone know if Bob is still in business?

I humidify my cigars with a Credo round humidor.  Credo sells a
"rejuvenator" liquid which is supposed to keep this device working well.
The trouble is this stuff is wildly expensive.  "Experts" tell me that the
rejuvenator fluid is just glycerine and is available at any drugstore.  I
read in the latest issue of Pipes Digest that the liquid is propylene
glycol.  Does anyone know what this stuff really is, and is there an
available substitute that won't cause my humidifier and cigars to melt-down?

Thanks for a great resource for those of us who still enjoy a load of good
tobacco in a nice pipe.

I have found it to be both enjoyable and economical. I got to thinking,

anyone before?  If not, how many of your readers might be interested in

<a name="41">Subject: Item for Pipes Digest -- Bio</a>

Steve and all,

I have been reading current (and past) Pipe Digests for some time
now, and as an official member (PD #206) wish to contribute a
10,000-words-or-less version of who/what/why I am with respect
to pipes and pipe smoking.  To wit:

My initial attempt to take up pipe smoking at about 14 years of age in
rural Oklahoma led me to a single $20 pipe (quite expensive, for that
area in those days, circa 1960) and the drug store tobacco rack:
Rum &amp; Maple, Half &amp; Half, Amphora, Prince Albert (actually, one of 
the better ones), etc.  That, combined with ignorance, led to failure.

Upon entering college (Oklahoma State University, newly renamed from
Oklahoma State Agricultural and Mechanical College), I took another
try at the pipe, testing mostly imported tobaccos, and I also tested
cigars and cigarettes.  The pipe experiments went nowhere fast, with
Balkan Sobranie providing the only moments that remain in memory. 
The "prestige" cigar on campus, Dutch Masters, I found uninteresting,
and Mississippi River Crooks were pleasant but too expensive for me
to consume at the rate I wanted to smoke them.  I wound up with a
Camel cigarette habit, nonfilter of course.

To digress, the Camel habit had a minor side effect a few years 
later,  that has served as a reminder to me that tastes do differ. 
Briefly, I wandered around III Corps with the 11th Armored Cavalry
(then-Col  George S. Patton, Jr., Commanding) for the last 7 months
of my 2  years 2 months 4 days in Vietnam.  One of the benefits to
being in the boonies was that every few weeks a goodie box would
arrive, containing toiletries, other sundries, and carton upon carton
of cigarettes.  All free.  Donated by the manufacturers.  A horde 
would descend upon the box, as guys scrambled to get their favorite 
brand of weeds.  I would simply wait a half hour, until the box was 
sitting there with no one in attendance, and then go over and pick 
up the 2 cartons of Camels that would be all that remained in the 
bottom of the box.  Never once were the Camels gone.  Never once was 
there anything in the box other than the Camels.  But, to return from 
this divergence and back to a slightly earlier time:

After arrival at the Defense Language Institute, Presidio of 
Monterey, CA, a few months after joining the Army, I made another 
try.  A $30 pipe and assorted tinned tobaccos from the tobacconist 
on Alvarado St introduced me to MacBaren's Golden Blend, but did not 
lead to a lasting habit.

After my hitch in the Army was up, I went to San Francisco to study
Japanese, and at an estate auction I went to with my wife-to-be I
acquired a set of "estate" pipes, in the literal sense.  Not knowing
how to sanitize them properly, I simply submerged all mouthpieces
in boiling water for 15 minutes, matched the ones that survived to
their respective bowls, cleaned the bowls and shanks with drugstore
ethanol, and went in search of a good tobacco in San Francisco-area
tobacco shops.  I tried the Dunhill mixtures, virtually everything
else that came in a can from the UK or Europe, and a miscellany of
whatever was available and recommended by tobacconists I ran across. 
MacBaren's proved to be the best of a bad lot, and I smoked Golden
Extra and a few other MacBaren's tinned goods for a time before
abandoning the attempt yet again.  By this time, I had learned a good
bit about pipe smoking, and about tobaccos, but things simply did not
jell.

In truth, I had become comfortable with my Camel habit, and when the
added complexity of pipe smoking yielded less pleasure than the
Camel, I could see no point in forcing the issue.  I did later give up
the Camels once, for 2 years.  I gained 5 pounds, my teeth resumed
rotting (I have so much metal in my mouth that you could mine it, all
from pre-smoking days plus the 2 years I was off the weed), my
metabolism was unpleasantly erratic, and I really missed the 
pleasures of the Injun weed.  I resumed my habit, pledging to
never again give up smoking.  This, later, resulted in a minor
complication, when my daughter developed asthma and the doctor's
orders were clear:  No smoking in the house or around Diana anywhere,
as it could trigger (in retrospect, had  triggered) an asthma attack.
Them things ain't fun, and they can be fatal.  Thenceforth, my smoking
was done outside, in my car when not accompanied by daughter, and at
other locations where smoking was accepted.

Then, I was posted to the UK by the Defense Department in mid-1992. 
That Christmas, what did I get from my wife but a pipe, of the filter 
variety.  She had quit smoking a few months after I met her (at my
suggestion, I might add, but that is another story), and considered
it her wifely duty to nag me occasionally to give up the evil weed,
but to no effect whatsoever.  She thought perhaps she could
encourage a shift from cigarette to pipe, which in her estimation
would be an improvement if not an ideal state of affairs.

I reflected on my past failed attempts to take up the pipe, decided
that if ever I were to succeed at it England would be the place where
it would occur, and presented myself at Tobacco World in the Regent
Arcade, pipe in hand, demanding that the piece of rubbish cum filter
be replaced with a good pipe and inquiring what sort of tobaccos were
on offer.

Peter Kelly (may he rest in peace) metaphorically took me in hand. 
He gently interrogated me on my past experiences with the pipe and
circumstances under which I would be smoking, swapped the disdained
piece of wood for a Peterson model 317, and provided an ounce of
Kentucky Nougat tobacco plus the necessary incidentals: inexpensive
IMCO butane pipe lighter, butane, flints, tapered pipe cleaners, and
such.  To this day, I have no idea what tobacco was in the Kentucky
Nougat.  Peter had several house blends he made up in the back room,
and like most tobacconists he viewed his ingredients lists as
proprietary.

About 3 weeks later, I complained to Peter that the pipe was still
smoking hot, even though it was beginning to break in well.  Instead
of the expected lecture on proper puffing, he simply took
three-quarters ounce of Kentucky Nougat, added to it a quarter ounce
of Scotch Cake, and sent me off again.  The heat problem was solved. 
And my next time in, I bought a second Peterson 317, this time a
Rustic, which smoked even better than the first smooth-finish one.
(The collection is now at 14 pipes, and I am thinking about a rack
that would hold 24 to allow room for growth.  But back to sequence.)

 I had started taking my pipe (later pipes) to work, and smoking
while on break, and I found a couple of mentors that were to prove
crucial.  My section chief, Mike Greenall, had taken up pipe smoking
while in the RAF.  His preferred pipe was a Dr. Plumb's Perfect Pipe,
Miniature (i.e. a short pipe with a very heavy bowl that sold for
about 6 or 7 pounds -- about $10 to $12 worth of UK Sterling, not 
weight).  He generally carried it in a shirt or jacket pocket- lit or 
unlit -in polite company, but with the stem tucked in his sock in an 
informal environment.  His tobacco was the original Condor.  His
first  bit of advice was that the quality of pipe was less important
than the quantity.  I should have a minimum of a half-dozen, and a
few more extras would be all to the good. 

My other mentor was one Mr. Black, a former Royal Army man, who
declared himself to have no sense of taste at all but a smoker of
Condor because of the psychic and physical pleasure it offered.  He
taught me much of what I know about how to take care of pipes and
tobaccos.  

Information gained over a 2.5-year period from these three (Peter
Kelly, Mike Greenall, and Mr. Black) plus what I have gained from my
small but expanding library of pipe and tobacco literature, seasoned
with opinion distilled from personal experience, constitutes my
stock in trade offered on alt.smokers.pipes.

But to return to tobaccos:  Even though the Kentucky Nougat-Scotch
Cake was smokeable, and pleasing in taste, I still was not entirely 
satisfied.  Often, I would smoke a bowl, and find myself craving a 
cigarette.  Not what I really wanted.

I resumed trials of other tobaccos.  I liked a pleasant aroma and
taste, and experimentation soon established that I craved strength in
both nicotine and tar.  And, to complicate matters, my mucous
membranes in the sinuses, throat, and mouth proved sensitive to most
tobaccos that provided aroma/taste, nicotine, and tar, all in
abundance.

After buying a couple of pounds of tobacco in "an ounce of this, and
try an ounce of that" fashion, I tallied the results and took the list
in to Peter.  With a couple of exceptions, everything that I liked and
that seemed to like me proved to be a flake tobacco made by Gawith,
Hoggarth &amp; Co.  I promptly focused on GHC tobaccos, and tried others
that Peter stocked that I had not yet sampled.  The twist tobaccos
proved to be pleasant, but too strong for me.  (Perhaps in my old
age, when I need to be parsimonious in my pleasures...).  And the mild
to medium varieties also were pleasant, but I reencountered the
earlier problem of finishing a bowl of pipe tobacco and craving a
cigarette.  The shag and other ready-rubbed varieties were ok, but
not as good as the flakes.  To summarize my current position on GHC
tobaccos, bearing in mind that these reflect highly personal 
judgments:

Rum Flake and Coniston Cut Plug are my staple tobaccos.  I sometimes
start with the Cut Plug earlier in the day and leave the Rum Flake for
evenings, when a slightly heavier effect is desired, but it is far
from unusual for me to take up an unfinished bowl of Rum Flake from
the night before and relight it to start the day.

Glengarry Flake provides a pleasant aroma, at a slight cost in
strength and a slight touch more irritation to the membranes.  I
liked it enough to get a pound for more thorough assessment, but since
the arrival of  Broken Flake No. 7 (see below) have been smoking that
instead.      

Bob's Flake provides a chocolate flavor and aroma that I find
pleasing.  It is a touch light on strength, so I usually smoke only
one bowl of it and then switch back to something stronger.

Broken Flake No. 7 offers a pleasant change of pace from the 
preceding.  I received a sample of it while in the UK (two bowls
worth) and a pound provided by Bob Lynch arrived just recently.  
I am still working on the detailed assessment.  

Kendal Flake is pleasant enough, but decidedly lacking in strength.

Dark Flake is very good on taste and strength, but slightly abrasive.

I assume that Peter's Scotch Cake was GHC Broken Scotch Cake.  It is
essentially neutral in taste and strength, but burns very cool and
slow.  Get some and mix it with a tobacco you like the taste of but
that burns too fast and hot.

If you like Virginia, get some of the GHC-manufactured Virginia. 
You may find that just as not all that glitters is pyrite, not all
Virginia is  of equal value.  The manufacturing process used does
make a difference. 

A paper read long ago on statistical analysis of failures in
semiconductors convinced me that a sample size under 30 meant that no
meaningful analysis could be done.  As my pipe collection remains
below half that magic number,  I probably should never discuss it at
all.  I have done so, on occasion,  in posts to alt.smokers.pipes,
and will probably do so again, but I will  spare you gentle reader
the gory details on this occasion.

To take up a theme implicit in my chronology above, my transition
from Oklahoma nonsmoking teenager to confirmed pipe smoker has taken
decades and several serious efforts.  This may be ascribed to
ignorance on my part, and of that there was plenty, but a second
critical factor was that tobaccos suitable for me were not readily
available.  The third factor, pipes, was a problem only in so far as
I did not realize how many I needed nor how critical having that
number was.

Had I known in 1961 what I know today, and had Gawith, Hoggarth &amp;
Co. tobaccos been available, I would not have missed the pleasures
and satisfaction of pipe smoking during most of my life.  It is not
my intent or desire to convert others to a theology of pipe smoking,
nor do I think those things that have proved most important to
me will be similarly important to all others.  But I do think there
are many today who like me in the 1960s would take up and enjoy the
pipe if they could, but do not due to ignorance and lack of guidance.
To help them, as Peter, Mike and Mr. Black helped me, I am pleased to
contribute to Pipe Digest, alt.smokers.pipes, and other fora.  And 
given the tobaccos readily available in the U.S., I think they need 
all the help they can get.

Which brings me to a final tag-end:  Some have noticed that I "plug"
Gawith, Hoggarth &amp; Co. tobaccos in posts to alt.smokers.pipes.  And of
course, you may have noticed my views above.  I must confess, my
motives  are not entirely altruistic.  True, I personally find
consider them the  best tobaccos available, but not all may share
that view.  The crux for me is, if the GHC distributor for the U.S.
and Canada Bob Lynch  gives up the business entirely (and he has
already given up advertising,  because it is too expensive) or should
he die (and he is a retiree, with  a limited life-span ahead of him)
and the business not be lucrative  enough for someone else to carry
on, I shall be able to get my preferred  tobaccos only by ordering
them from the UK, and that is expensive!   When I was sampling
everything available from tobacconists in the  Northern Virginia area
(Tobacco Barn, John B. Hayes, Georgetown Tobacco,  John Crouch, plus
telephone inquiries to Fader's and the Smoke Shop in  Annapolis), and
finding nothing but what I considered adulterated rubbish  and
only-marginally-unacceptable import tins, I called Ann Kelly and had 
her send me a couple of pounds Air Mail.  Bottom Line on the
Mastercard  bill:  $80 a pound.

Ouch!

<a name="42">Subject: pipe smoking on the campus</a>

this letter is partly in regards to a letter in the last digest 
concerning pipe smoking on college campuses.

i currently attend calvin college in grand rapids michigan.  i have been 
smoking at great intervals a borrowed (from my father) bent whitehall of 
london briar. this has been somewhat inhibited by a campus rule.  our campus 
has a no smoking policy in all the buildings on campus.  (tons of fun in 
the cold michigan winters, let me tell you.)  despite this, the 
percentage of smokers here is quite high.  sadly, most choose cheap 
cigarettes.  

part of my motive for learning the art of the pipe was the society that 
goes on outside the buildings.  especially on warmer nights, the 
gathering of smokers allows for plans to be made and ideas to be shared.  
we have a comunity here.  though our number may be small, we pipe smokers 
are a happy lot.

   =========== A 1 Cigar's Notice ==========

We have received the first shipment of the year from Cuba. 
Most are fillins of higher volume lower priced cigars.

**"The Cubans have changed the Inspection Codes"** 

As of Janruary 1, 1996 the old inspection codes are no more.

We received MonteCristos No. 3 and the tubos #6.
Romeo y Julieta Cazadores and Cedros de Luxe No 1.
Juan Lopez Seleccion No 1 (great)

Some of the reserved cigars are being shipped now.

There are Cuban cigar shortages and shipment delays.

Everyone that deals with Cuba has a limiting Cigar quota.  
These quotas are calculated the first of every year.
On certain cigars the whole year's quota is sold by mid year.
This is the big reason for the end-of-the-year cigar shortages.  

We have some great cigars in the bonded warehouse.
Check the "Available" list.
If you do not receive the "Available" list 
and would like to, please email us.

<a name="44">Subject: Parker Pipes and aging tobacco</a>

Hello Steve and all pipe smokers;

The other day I was smoking one of my favorite tobaccos(LPI Bombay court)
in one of my favorite pipes and wonder;why don't more people talk about
Parker pipes?I bought this one about six years ago new.Its a large,half
bent smooth finish "Earl".Even at a rather overpriced tobacconist,I beleive
I paid $55.00 or so.If I remember correctly this is the brand that uses the
seconds from Dunhill.The pipe looks like a Dunhill and smokes
wonderfully.It does have a number of sand pits on the surface,but they are
barely noticable and certainly don't have any effect on the smoke.I would
imagine this to be a group six size bowl.I don't remember the last pipe
shop I was in that I noticed Parkers.I have heard of Parker-Hardcastle but
don't know if they are of the same maker or the same(Dunhill seconds)
quality as this Parker.I wonder if anyone else has any thoughts on the
suject.
     As far as tobacco aging goes,I've been putting away a tin here and a
tin there for the last four years or so and am really begining to reap the
rewards.The aforementioned tin of Bombay Court is dated 9/5/91.Upon opening
it,the tobacco,particularly the Virginias was covered with sugar
crystals.The smoke was sooooo smooth.The oriental and latakia was a perfect
marriage!The taste is vastly different from the cans of Bombay that I've
opened in the past,and smoked without the benefit of aging.I'm hoping this
is the case for the older tins of Escudo that I have laying around as
well.I usually pick up a tin of something each time I visit a tobacco shop
and put a date on it for my "cellar".My regular smoke usually rotates
between MacBaren Plumcake and Dunhill Royal Yacht.In the house,for those
times I need a nice smelling aromatic,I really am impressed with
Cornell&amp;Diehl #815,a really nice chocolate that smokes to the bottom of the
bowl leaving nothing but a grey-white ash.Try that with Capt Black.Of
course Capt does have a non smoker pleasing aroma.
Well,keep up the good work and I think if circulation gets much higher,your
sign-off will stand a good chance of coming true(Pipe smokers may indeed
rule the world!).
               Humbly Submitted
               Mike Stanley:-?

responded to my question re Sergio Iannini's message (subject:
"Special Offer for Pipes Digest readers") in the last issue.  Well,
this is a case in which Yr. Obdt. Moderator should have read his own
policy!  Which says, pretty plainly, that advertising is welcome if
it's brief, not repeated too much, and on topic for the group (e.g.,
for pipes, cigars, tobacco, and related stuff.)  But off-topic ads
(e.g., for phone services) are another matter, and always have been;
the article simply shouldn't have gotten in.  My apologies to anyone
whose hackles were raised.

And now, let us take the phone off the hook, light up, and smooth our
hackles a bit...  and look in this issue for some upcoming pipe shows,
including one by the New Yok Pipe Club this weekend!

Fine Pipes Have Arrived in Moscow!

After three and a half years living here in
Moscow and doing my pipe shopping just about
anywhere else, collector's pipes such as
Ser Jacopo, Mastro de Paja and Stanwell have
arrived, along with Dunhill. I hope to join
the fray soon by becoming the agent for Courrieu;
they invited me to meet with them when I visit
France again in April.

The only question is, how badly did I get ripped
off by buying a Ser Jacopo Delecta with silver
band and spigot for 360$ (1,690,000 rubles,
for anyone who follows Russia)? What is the going
price for such a pipe in the US or Europe?

Also, this pipe, the 50th in my collection, marked
my first purchase of a filter pipe. I know that
in my native New York, real men don't smoke filter pipes,
but the filter really makes a difference in 
controlling wetness. I will probably add a few
more filter pipes to my collection this year.
Any comments on filter pipes?

Yitzchak Schier, Moscow.

[ Was the Ser Jacopo new or "estate", Yitzchak?  I've had many others
praise the European 9mm filter system. -S. ]

 ... just a few comments on Dirk Bahlo's message:
 &gt; 
 &gt; From: "Dirk Bahlo" &lt;????.?????@??.???????????????.??&gt;
 &gt; Subject: re: German pipe brands
 
 &gt;    There are indeed decent brands that come from Germany, but not many, 
 &gt; that is only two, as far as I know. One of them is *Vauen*. The 

There are also some (approx. 5-10) excellent German pipe makers who
make a few hand-made pipes per year; names that cross my mind are:
Ingo Garbe (who actually lives in Denmark these days), Klaus
Billerbeck (Hamburg), Juls (Julian Schaefer?), Bertram Safferling,
etc). Futhermore, there is a company called DB Design (?) located in
Berlin; they produce machine-made pipes I would consider to be in the
same category as Vauen. And there is Bentley, who either have their
design made in Switzerland and produce in Germany, or vice versa (I
keep confusing this).

I am personally not so enthusiastic about Vauen pipes; I own two of
them found bothsomewhat dissappointing. As to my experience, you get
better value for money from Stanwell or Savinelli. But this is of
course a matter of personal taste. It might be related to the fact
that I belong to the minority of 10% in Germany who do not like
filters...  Btw, Vauen will also deliver their pipes without a
filter-hole in the shank (upon request).

 &gt;    The second one is *Oldenkott*. 

As far as I know, Oldenkott went bankrupt a couple of years ago. They
became known outside Germany for producing the famous Porsche
pipe. Now and then you can still find some of their pipes in the
shops.

Finally, and not related to the above: if you should happen to be in
Milan, Italy: stand in front of the cathedral, look for a shopping
arcade to the left (after visiting the cathedral of course :-)). Near
its end on the right hand side, there is a shop with a spectacular
selection of Castello pipes (probably more than 200 pieces). Prices
are _very_ interesting due to the "cheap" Italian Lira (a "Collection
Fiamata" was about US-$ 300.00 a few weeks ago).  A real "must".  Some
knowledge of Italian is, however, useful.

Best,

I'll put it in the Guide. -S. ]

A quick correction.  In the last digest, someone commented about 
Gerald MCRainey and Jameson Parker of the TV show "Simon &amp; Simon".  It 
was thought that Gerald McRainey was much more comfortable with them than 
Jameson Parker.  I have a newsletter from Amphora that I picked up at a 
pipe show in Northern Virginia a few years back that has an article from 
Richard Hacker where he had interviewed Jameson Parker who IS a pipe 
smoker. So perhaps his seeming discomfort was just really good acting. . .

Dollars More".  In The Ultimate Pipe Book, Hacker identifies Van Cleef 
as a notable pipee, and comments "actor Lee Van Cleef puffed on a 
well-used meerschaum as he played a bounty hunter opposite Clint 
Eastwood ..." (p. 214).

Dear readers of Pipe Digest:

I am a relatively new pipe smoker and have a short question.  I recently
bought a tin of an English style tobacco from a well known and expensive
tobacco distributor known better for their cigars, which shall remain
nameless as I enjoy their cigars.  However, when I opened the tin, the smell
was, well, very unpleasant.  Now I love the smell of a tobacco shop, and
have never disliked any pipe tobacco I've encountered until now.  Is it
possible I received a bad tin, or is it because the mixture is "English" and
I'm used to more "Danish" blends of Virginia, Burley and Cavendish tobaccos?
The mixture in question is composed of red Virginia, Oriental tobaccos and
Latakia.

S.M.S.

[ Latakia smells fairly strong... can you describe the way in which it
was unpleasant? -S. ]

Hi Steve,

As always I enjoyed the PD this morning over a good cup of coffee and my
morning wake pipe. While reading Jason Helmick's letter I was reminded of
the attitude of our local tobacco shop. Its the Pipe and Pouch Tobacco Shop
located in Fairbanks, Alaska. The proprietory, who's name is Dave, also
tends to be rather rude. In fact his rudness has me ordering my pipe and
tobac by mail rather than endure his attitude. I have been to his shop on
six different occasions and on five of them he has treated me as if I was
more of an inconvience, rather than a paying customer. One the sixth he
smiled, well actual this occured during the third visit or I would'nt have
tried his place a fifth and sixth time. At first I assumed he was just
having a bad day. So either all his days are bad or he's just does'nt care
about his clientel.

This has cost him quit a bit in the last couple of years. I actual live in
North Pole, Ak. approximately 15 miles from Fairbanks, and although he is
the only tobac shop for 350 miles, I'll never use him again. I have bought
about 8 new pipes during the last 24 months, this includes Peterson,
Bonfiglioli, and West's, not cheap pipes and various amounts of different
tobaccos for my smoking enjoyment. So to all who visit Fairbanks, bring your
own tobacco. The service is'nt worth it.

Now for a good note, if your traveling through Anchorage on your way up
north, stop by and vist the Tobacco Cache on Northern Lights Blvd. They have
always helped me with any questions and will blend any mix you like. I don't
have their address at the moment, but will get it and send to you for
inclusion in the digest. And if their are any fellow pipe smokers in living
in the bush, the TC will does mail orders.

Hello, Steve, I really enjoy the digest. Up to now, I have restrained from

mentioned. It just so happens, that last Saturday, I was browsing the local
Huntsville pipe shop, The Humidor, and came across a Parker Hardcastle. I,
too, have the understanding that Parker Hardcastles are produced by Dunhill.
Nevertheless, this pipe has quickly turned into the favorite in my
collection of Petersons, GBDs, and varied expensive Italian handmades. It's
light, smokes cool, and has the traditional look of and English pipe which I
like. Though, I paid $65.00 for this pipe, I feel it was well worth it. Keep
up the great work and smoke in peace.

Hi all you cigar aficianados!

I have very important news for all of you in the New Jersey/New York area, if
you are interested in smokers' nights.

Here is the ad that I found in the newspaper:

Cigar Evening Smoke-In Gala Planned for area Aficianados

Carmen J. Maggio, president of Rowe-Manse Emporium, announced plans today for
the first in a series of Smoker's Evenings in New Jersey.  A "Magnificent
Evening for Cigar Aficianados" will be held on March 8, 1996 at Mayfair Farms
in West Orange, New Jersey.

The magnificent evening will include a wonderful 5 course Gourmet Dinner,
complete with cocktail hour, international hors 'oeurvres, fine wines and
brandies along with fine hand-made cigars to compliment each course.  The
evening also includes an expert cigar roller, a guest speaker, appearances by
stage and screen personalities and numerous door prizes ranging from weekends
for two at Trump Plaza to cigar humidors.

Carmen J. Maggio indicates that there will be additional Cigar Dinners held
throughout the year.  Rowe-Manse also has a Cigar Club which cigar smokers
may join to take advantage of specials, events, etc. etc.

Mr. Maggio is currently searching for a 1920's railroad car, which he plans
to use as a "smoking car" to provide a comfortable setting for his
cigar-smoking customers to relax and enjoy a cappuccino with their cigars
while wives shop.  The railroad car will be placed at the rear of the store.
  
{{{Just a note, guys.  I didn't write this.  So I didn't put in the part
about smoking while wives shop.  I consider myself a "womanist,"  and I
understand that many of the smokers on this list are woman.  Well, on with
the advertisement}}}

Those interested in signing aboard for a truly magnificent evening are
encouraged to call  1-800-633-3100

IF you guys would like to go, feel free, but I already have prior
engagements.

Dear Steve,

I have been with PD since PD #198, but this is my first
contribution.

In PD #210, Steve Russo (????????@????.????????.???) mentions
something about roll-you-own cigars. I, for one, would be
interested in more information, as I am both a pipe and cigar
smoker (I started on the pipe, though). (Note that this is cc'd
to him.)

This triggered a thought: where do I get the raw materials? Since
my family maintains a large garden, I am sure I can take a
corner, or even expand the present one, to produce tobacco.

So, the question is, does anyone know about growing tobacco? What
should I treat the soil with? Does tobacco prefer acid/alkaline
conditions? Will I be able to get a crop in the northeast (NE PA,
almost NYS)? Most importantly, where do I get seed/shoots to
start the plants?

I would like to thank anyone in advance for any information.

Hi Steve,

I have an unfortunate up date to my attempt at producing a Home
Cigar-Making Kit.  Due to the prohibitive massive government red tape (ATF)
involved in getting a license to sell tobacco products and leafs, the
reality of producing this kit is too difficult.  However, there is a cigar
maker in Sacramento, CA who makes the best handmade cigars anywhere in the
world.  Casillas Cigars are every bit as good in quality as A. Fuente,
Padron, Macanudo, ect. for about half the price.  Each cigar consists of :
Wrapper - Connecticut Natural, Ecuador Natural, Mexican, and Maduro.   Long
Filler - Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua.
Binders- Mexican, Ecuador.
Wrapper + Filler + Binder =  5 Country Blend.   Compare that to any
commercially available cigar!

Hi everybody I'm new to this internet stuff so please bear with me. I am 32

meerschaum pipes. I have enjoyed smoking my pipes since high school. I like
to collect matched sets of briar &amp; meerschaum pipes, so if anyone knows
where I may find some please let me know, I also would like to find a
supplier of Ascorti pipes since the tinder box stores in my area seem to be
closing shop.

I would also like to reply to Tony Spiegel question about differences
between drug store pipes and the more expensive pipes. I to started out with
drug store pipes then my granfather bought me my first Ascorti pipe. I think
you will find that quality pipes will burn cooler and therefor smoke better.
Some cheaper pipes also use wood fillers to make the pipe look better but
this also causes hot spots.  There are also different grades of briars just
as ther are different grades of wood used in building fine furniture.If you
can afford the better pipes I think you will enjoy relaxing with them more.

I would also like to thank Douglas Cope for his helpful hints on viewing the

From: ???????@???.????????.??? (Jon Erik Penvose)
<a name="22">Subject: A few thoughts regarding Pipes Digest #210...</a>

Greetings,

A few various and sundry items hopefully of general interest.  First,
I was impressed by Mark Peterson's rather complete tutorial relating
to the use of oversized pipes.  I personally dislike very large pipes,
as they make my jawbone hurt from the weight.  However, his
suggestions on smoking technique would certainly help those who are
not gaining full enjoyment from their pipe smoking experience.  I am
not clear though, on what Mr. Peterson meant by inhaling smoke.  Does
this mean inhaling into the lungs?  Whenever I inhale pipe smoke into
my lungs, it is by accident and it is not at all pleasant.  I have
been under the impression that almost no one inhales pipe smoke into
the lungs.  I wonder, is the practice more prevalant than I thought it
was?

Second, regarding the question of commercial advertising in the
Digest.  Please cast my vote against advertising that is not related
to the subject of this publication.  I realize everyone has to make a
living, but this is not the place for it.

The real driving force that caused me to write this time regards the
submission by Jason C. Helmick regarding the unfortunate experience
suffered by his wife and her friend.  Here is a situation where a
paying customer is treated like dirt by a salesperson for no better
reason than the fact that he can not put his predjuces aside long
enough to conduct a business transaction.  When I read Mr. Helmick's
letter, I was impacted; I felt an emotional response (this is unusual
for me, I normally have a very detached view of things).  As I
reflected upon it, I found that I felt ashamed and embarrassed by the
clerk's actions to the ladies.  You see, I believe that pipe smokers
are a distinct class of people.  I assert that, more often than not,
pipe smokers are people who have resolved certain basic problems
dealing with life.  A pipe smoker is someone who is and should be the
voice of reason, calm, and balance.  I found that the feeling of
embarassment I felt was the fact that these salesclerks and I are
supposed to be part of the same niche in society.  Their inexcuseable
actions reflect not only on myself, but all pipe smokers as a whole.
And that, my good friends, is a terrible shame.

I myself was once made to feel unwelcome by the owner of a smokeshop.
Last year, I learned that a Tinder Box location was opening in nearby
Harrisburg, PA.  I had frequented a Tinder Box when I lived for a time
in Tacoma, WA, and I was satisfied with my dealings there.  I had a
Friday off, so I braved the crushing Friday afternoon city traffic to
pay a visit.  I soon learned that this Tinder Box was tailored for the
suit, tie, and cufflinks crowd; which does not include me very often.
Although the owner was not openly rude, he made it crystal clear that
I was not a welcome guest in his store.  What a dissapointment.

Well, I suppose I've lectured long enough.  Keep up the good work,
Steve.  It does not go unnoticed.

Regards,

Jon Erik Penvose (???????@???.???????.???)

[ Thanks, Jon!  I also was wondering what readers thought about Mark
Peterson's suggestion on inhaling smoke.  I've known people who did,
but personally I agree with you. -S. ]

Hi Steve,

My name is Jude Rennolds.  This e-mail is my girlfriends.  I am blind, 
have a seeing eye dog and love pipes and pipe smoking.  Toni and I and 
recently discovered the Net.  This is facisinating for me.  She has 
been reading the different things that we are coming across.  

I have been a pipe for about 20 years.  I have a few pipes that I love.
My favorits being, Cessini 8-dot (I think that how that is spelled), 
Lovat, I have a Dunhill from the '30's an number 2 i would say, and a 
Savanelli, Punto 'Oro.  I have others, but these I enjoy most of the 
time.  Some of my favorite tobaccos are Dunhill Black Aromatic, 
Straight Virginia, house Blend from Gus's Smoke shop, Sherman Oaks, 
CA., Ancient Mariner, Boswains Mate, also from Gus's, Honey Cavendish, 
from the Tinder Box, Santa Monica and Epicurian also from the Tinder 
Box.  I have smoked for many years and I like variety, but for the 
present the Honey Cavendish is my favorite.  I am really enjoying 
finding these resources.  It has taken many years to find out that it 
takes skill to smoke a pipe.  

I will relate a story that happened a fews years back.  My pipe smoking 
brother and I were at Gus's in the Valley, I bought a Comoy Bulldog, He 
a #2 Dunhill Billiard (both estate pipes).  AT the time my favorite 
tabacco was Punchbowl, from a company in Ireland, and my friend smoked 
Craven mixture, same company.  We bought our treasures, could hardly 
wait to light up, ran to the car, and reclined the seats, and I have a 
little keychain screwdriver for opening tins, with our ears to our tins 
we opened the tins to hear the hissing of the air escaping the tins.  
Loaded our bowls, lit our pipes and smoked ourselves into a coma.  We 
could not wait to drive home.  Coming out of the coma we realized that 
the car was full of smoke, visability zero, opened the windows, smoke 
billowed out, and passerbys were laughing.  What a heavenly memory.

<a name="27">Subject: Ohio Pipe Collectors 1996 Swap/Sell Show</a>

Steve, I'm really pleased to announce the final details of the 1996 Ohio
Pipe Collectors swap/sell pipe show (pipes only; no cigars) on Saturday,
Sept. 14, 1996 at the Holiday Inn on Lane Ave. in Columbus.  This is the
same location as last year, but we have increased the space by half again,
with room for 65 dealer tables.  Again, there will be no admission charge
for the public. Dealer tables are $25 until June 1, $30 thereafter, first
come first served.  As Neil Murray recorded so well, in words and pictures,
in his Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette, last year's show was a huge
success.  We're getting a much earlier start this year and are expecting a
much bigger and better show.
 
The Holiday Inn (614-294-4848) is offering a special rate of $69 for show
attendees for single, double, triple and quadruple rooms, so for all who
plan to come, get your reservation in early and troll for others to share a
room with you.
 
Last year was my first attempt at producing a show, and I was extremely
nervous, but right now I'm confident of a huge success. If any of your
subscribers would like a show flyer (or more than one if you can distribute
them), please send me your mailing address.  Also, if anyone would like to
rent one or more tables, contact me for a participation sheet, which also
contains a line for donations to our raffle--the thing that keeps us in the
black, as the rest of our money goes for show expenses and producing our
quarterly newsletter (or magazine, as my wife said after the last one).  If
anyone would like to donate something for the raffle in exchange for all
the fulsome praise we can heap upon you and publicity we can give you,
please write for a sheet.
 
Having gone over 100 members last year, we are shooting for 200 this year
(dues only $12 per year, pro-rated for new members). As always, anyone
interested in joining the OPC should contact me for a complimentary
newsletter.  Our mailing address is Ohio Pipe Collectors, P.O. Box 9642,
Columbus OH 43209.  Thanks for your help.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Secretary, Ohio Pipe Collectors

Hi Steve,

Wonder if you can help me out on this one.  My brother in law is going to 
Italy for 2 weeks and I'd like him to pick me up a pipe (or a couple 
depending on price).  I was wondering if you knew of or had a reference 
of Italian pipe makers listed by town?  The highgrade briar Italian pipe 
makers must sell direct, don't they?  Or is it better to go to a 
smoke/pipe shop to buy?  Any idea of quality pipe shops in Italy?  How 
do the prices compare, I am assuming that they will be better buying over 
there than trying to purchase here.  

I know this is a lot to ask but you are the guru.......

Thanks

Steve-

Have you seen the recent postings by [deleted. -S.] and a few
others...?  Louis went ranting that if the feds ever came to take away
his tobacco or his automatic weapons he'd shoot them the way Gordon
Liddy recommended (i.e.  to be sure to kill them quickly), and then
someone else who has (of all things!) a service record with the USMC
on his sig said something vaguely approving about that, and now we
have [deleted. -S.] talking about something that sounds suspiciously
related.  Are these guys just doing the macho mode or is there
something we should be "concerned about"...?

Not to go calling for censorship of their little rants, but frankly it bugs
me, and it's not like I'm being squeamish or anything.  What's your opinion
of all this...?

<a name="32">Subject: Boulder smoking ban &amp; Laudisio's Italian Restaurant</a>

[ Picked up from alt.smokes.cigars, with permission of the author. -S. ]

There is a thread within ASC about Boulder's anti-smoking law. 

Essentially, Boulder residents voted to ban all smoking in public
places (yes, to Boulder-ites, your restaurant is a public place). In
order to permit smoking, the room must be sealed from any non-smoking
areas (yeah - sealed). You must have a seperate ventilation system
also.

One restaurant was going to have a cigar dinner, but caved in because
they feared lingering smells the following day. One Hotel had a nice
smoking area, but banned cigars now because the cigarrette smokers
complained about the smell! ( Hotel Boulderado - call and let them
hear from you if you're inclined (303) 442-4344 )

Now realize, this town thinks of itself as "too hip". There are more
"under 50-year olds" living off trust funds per-capita than anywhere
else in the USA. Heard the term: idle-rich? They're here and deciding
how we should live. (hey, nothing against being rich - I trying also)
The kicker is that this town supports and promotes the notions of
"freedom" and "self-expression" like Atlanta promotes the Olympics! 

There is one true maverick in this town and he's a real character.
Antonio Laudisio. His restaurant (one of the finest and the BEST wine
list in town) has been non-smoking for 8 years prior to the smoking
ban. The "ban" completely goes against his grain and he is putting his
money behind his principals. 

Antonio cleared out a stockroom, painted the walls and ceiling, added
persian carpet and fine antiques, installed a mother of a ventilation
system, installed a humidor, added lots of Wine Spectator and CA mags,
and great books on Cuba and cigars. The lighting is subtle and the
service is terrific. His entire staff is attentive to the cigar crowd
and very polite.

Now, Laudisio's Italian Restaurant is THE place in this area for cigar
smokers!  There has never been any pressure to spend money and
sometimes we spend alot, sometimes very little. We have a secluded
smoking room, lots of conversation, great people and true freedom to
do as we please.

If you even think of coming to the Boulder area, please stop in and
say hello to some fellow  ASCers.

Their number is 303/442-1300.

Matt Steele

[ Excellent, Matt!  And if you're reading this, please give my
congratulations to Antonio on his bravery, and wish him the best of
success in his venture. -S. ]

<a name="33">Subject: Help Me</a>

     Dear Sir

I started smoking pipe not long ago, and i have some difficulties in it. I
asked a friend of mine, who is also a new pipe smoker, and he suggested that
i contact you for help (in fact, i`m sending that email through him).
I`ve read your "how to" section about pipes, and i have several "up to the
point" questions. If you would be willing to help me, i would very gratefull.

1. In your "how to" section, you wrote : "Try to smoke all the way down". Is
this mean that i am to smoke to tobacco "all the way down" to the lungs? -a
salesman in the pipe shop told me that it is forbidden, for you can die from
the hot smoke you breath. Nevertheless, only through smoking the pipe all
the way to the lungs gives me the sense of taste from the tobacco. What
shall i do?

2. You said that a "cake" is leaving of millimieters of tobacco inside your
bowl. I have 2 questions concerning that: I`m using a "Dr Plumb" pipe. Is
that necessary in order to have a "better" smoke? -and second, do i need to
clean the bowl (i.e to through out all the tobacco left in it) after every
smoke, and leave the so called "cake"?

3. You also mentioned a rhythmical smoking of the pipe. How can that be
obtained?

I`m very sorry for all the trouble i cause, but it means a lot to me.

Thank you in advance,

Joe Sartre.

??????@?????????.???.??

[ (1) By "all the way down," I meant "all the way down to the bottom
of the bowl." (2) The cake is necessary to avoid burning the wood of
the pipe as you smoke.  But if the pipe was advertised as "needs no
breaking in", it was probably pre-carbonized, and thus you don't have
to build up a cake.  The cake can only be removed by scraping the
walls of the bowl; don't worry about losing it when you empty the
pipe. (3) You're in an orchestra and you're asking _me_ about rhythm?
:-) Seriously, though, assuming that you've packed and lit it
correctly: if it gets too hot to hold, or burns your tongue, puff
slower.  If it goes out a lot, puff faster.  Hope this helps! -S. ]

I visited a tobacco shop last week that had Nordings along with Erick's 
(or Erica's, sorry not sure) and the owner said they were "the same as 
Nordings," i.e., produced by the same company, just a different name. Is 
this correct? What are the differences? All were priced at $95.00. Is 
this high, low or competitive? I'm a relatively new subscriber 
so I apologize in advance if this is something already hashed over in the

Hi,I had not talked to you before. I am not a pipe smoker but have been
interested in them quite awhile. I have been chatting with a group on irc
on the pipes room. I think someone said they saw you there once.  I would
like to chat with you sometime,and i know the others would too. I do read
some of the things on the pipes digest site and the newsgroup. I know mark
tinsky has been on once. I asked him if he would like to chat also. It is
on irc.dal.net,6667 on the room named pipes. The group usually comes on
after 10 pm, some nights are slower than other. The usual big chat is sat
night. I am one of the ops but VicVixvi,his nickname on there, is the
creator of the room. Hope to see you there if you are not too busy. I
always like chatting with new people. Rich.

Steve,

Thank you for the intro... what a great publication!  After 20 zillion
cigarettes, (I recall smoking only 3) I finally started *tasting*
tobacco, with a Ben Wade Regent.  Wow!  I live in L.A., and have been
frequenting the Wilshire Ave. Tinder Box store.  Presently, going
through the process of trying an ounce of 'this or that'.
 
 I really enjoy the English blends, particularly "Baker Street Full".
Like searching for a full bodied coffee, or a fine bourbon, or cigar,
I'm sure this will take time.  Would you please direct me to some of
the 'Pipe Clubs' in L.A.?

Steve,

     I have just recently subscribed and read the PD you mailed. I found it
very interesting. One observation I made is there do not seem to be a large
percentage of cigar smokers contributing to the Digest. Is that typical or
are most of the members pipe smokers as opposed to cigar smokers? Also, do
you have any information concerning cigar clubs?
     As a matter of information for your cigar smokers, several of us have
started making a cigar friendly bar a regular after work meeting place on
Thursdays. It is the Paisley Pineapple in Greensboro, NC. It is on the second
floor above the restaurant and has a nice decor and is furnished with sofas
and easy chairs. The owner keeps a table-top humidor stocked or you can bring
your own. For subscribers who live in the area it is located in the 300 block
of S. Elm St.
     I am new to AOL and I look forward to receiving and contributing to the
digest.

[ Well, Randy, it all depends on what the members post here.  We have,
I'm sure, hundreds members who smoke cigars, exclusively, primarily,
or occasionally.  Same with pipes, etc.

The Guide does list a bunch of cigar clubs; new ones are always

Thanks for enrolling me. I have a couple of questions/inquiries that
hopefully generate some responses. 1. I have a particular interest in
Charatans -usuallly large at least, freehand and/unusual shapes and GBD
Uniques. Anyone that has any available, let me know. 2. A particular
request for two Charatans that I parted with maybe 3-4 years ago that I
would like to get back-probably very little chance. But just in case,
these two were sold for me at Barcays in Columbus, Ohio and were both
large/extra large executives freehand. The 1st was straight, "broken
top"bowl style and unstained with typical slanting bowl and "flowers like
" at base of bowl, 2nd a full bend ,"broken topSTyle" bowl. 3. How do I
join pipe Club of London and pay here in US?
Thanks.

Another milestone in the Digest's history: we're now _well_ ahead of
the 2000-member mark, and still growing!  Thanks to all who've made
the Digest the colossal behemoth juggernaut it is today! :-)

And speaking of (possible) colossal behemoth juggernauts...

[ASTRONOMY] I know that many members are forced to smoke outside (and
indeed, in the next century, we may be the only people who still _go_
outside at all.)  So why not make the best of it?  While you're
outdoors, watch for a new comet, named Hyakutake, which is scheduled
to appear very bright and large in the evening skies later this month.
Who knows, it may make up for Kohoutek, Halley, et. al.!  You can
learn more about it on the Web page:

	<a href="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/">http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/</a>

Lest you think this is too far off topic, also check out "The Stars: A
New Way To See Them" by H.A. Rey.  The constellation Bootes
(Herdsman), which is visible in the Northern Hemisphere sky now, is
depicted sitting and smoking a pipe.  As Rey says, it's "a sensible
thing for a herdsman to do."  And a fun read!

[PROHIBITIONS] And, if you thought the anti-tobacco jihad was bad, you
ain't seen nothing yet!  Even more scandalous is the suspectedly
Illuminati-run Committee to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide:

	<a href="http://www.circus.com/~no_dhmo/">http://www.circus.com/~no_dhmo/</a>

But, while you still can, why not join us with a smoke and a glass of
vintage dihydrogen monoxide, as we search for stray comets...

Smoke Signal #21
?????@???.???.???

Saturday, 24 June 1876, General George Armstrong Custer
arrived at the confluence of the Big Horn and Little Big Horn
rivers in the Montana Territory. Custer was leading the vanguard
of troops under command of General Terry; the main body was due
to join Custer on the 26th. Intelligence reports spoke of the
presence of a small force of Indians, to which Custer responded
by divided his command into three parties that moved forward, on
the 25th, to encircle the enemy. Surprised by a force much larger
than expected, Custer led the two hundred and twenty-six men of
the center column into the thick of battle. Custer, the Little
Big Horn, and the rest are history. They knew news of victory in
Indian communities in all directions, long before it reached the
ears of the European settlers. Indians of the plains used the
smoke signal to exchange messages across long distances, a series
of long and short puffs. On a clear day they could hear for
miles.

Friday, 10 November 1995, was a clear day; one of those days
on the Southern Plains typical for its bright light, clear skies
of pale blue, cool still air, and winter vegetation of sepia
tinted hues similar to the colors used on the Dunhill Christmas
card; a day on which Smoke Signal Nineteen rose into the vault
above, its message read and understood by David Webb,
representative for Alfred Dunhill Pipes Limited in London. Mr.
Webb sent me E-mail to let me know that Dunhill now owns Parker
and that we can have pipe cleaners direct from Dunhill in London.
Sometime later, the noon stagecoach brought me a packet of fifty
cleaners, accompanied by a Christmas card from Mr. Webb for
Dunhill, and a request that I confirm they still work as they
always have. Here is my assessment of Parker's Conical Pipes
Cleaners as made in England today.

Upon inspection, the Parker cleaner of today is clearly a
fraction of an inch longer than the cleaner of old. I am in the
happy situation of directly comparing old and new. The nap of the
old cleaner is of slightly better quality, it is a trifle denser;
the nap on the new cleaner is not quite as tightly bound. I can
say that the new cleaner has the required stiffness of character
to pass the steck-test in triumph. Overall, Parker's Conical Pipe
Cleaners continue to clean as they did, although I would like to
see a return to the restful nap of old. I have some of these old
cleaners that I will be glad to send to Mr. Webb, so that he can
see for himself.

A footnote: In Digest #211, Mr. De Luca reported having a Parker
pipe with a broken stem. Dunhill own Parkers and should, therefore,
be capable of making repairs to these pipes.

<a name="5">Subject: I heard a rumor</a>

Steve,

Your latest issue of Pipes Digest reminded me of something I heard from a 
friend of mine who just got back from Chicago.

Cafe Ba-Ba-Ree-Ba, that great Lettuce Entertain You tapas bar in Chicago, 
has added a smoking lounge.  Apparently, they sell a small number of 
cigars (of good variety with respect to price and quality), for smoking 
after your excellent meal along with your cognac.  I'm telling the PD 
crowd in case anyone in or visiting Chicago would like to check it out.  
I'll have to enjoy it vicariously; I moved from Chicago to Boston this 
year (the winters are better but the basketball worse).  So even though I 
can't recommend it, not having been there since the cigar room opened, I 
will definitely say go for the food.

While I'm at it, there's a club called "Drink" in Chicago (Hmm...I wonder
what goes on there?) which last year added a smoking lounge in their
basement.  It was very well decorated, but a little trendy.  Cigars in
their humidor were (quite) overpriced, more than you'd expect, but there
is a well-stocked bar in the room.  The manager of the joint says Michael
Jordan frequents it, but I'll just pass that on without comment... We had
a meeting of the Chicago Cigar Internet GRoup (CCIGR) there last year, and
it was fine.  I'd only recommend it for gatherings were most bring their
own stogies. 

Just thought I'd pass those along.  Keep up the good work, Steve.

GROW YOUR OWN TOBACCO

Its time to order seeds if you haven't yet already.  I've been growing
tobacco for 5 years now. Its easy, and it grows just fine anywhere
you can grow tomatoes. BTW, I just discovered a tobacco seed company
on the net. Big selection of seeds. I Can hardly wait to try some new
(to me) havana varieties. Check it out.

BTW, I've had very good luck growing Burley. Grows big &amp; fast (I'm in
Massachusetts), very large leaves, smooth smoke and good for chewing
also. Also Jasmine is one of the best for show &amp; sweet scent (but it
didn't smoke as well as the Burley). I've grown may other varieties
too.

I know its gonna be the best year ever for my home grown hand made
cigars (pipe filler too). 

Sincerely,

Steve
This is an addition/continuation to my mail to you yesterday for the
digest. Hope it still fits, as I lost contact and could not get back on.
It concerns my "impossible request" to locate two Charatan freehands that
I sold through Barclays in Columbus, Ohio about 3 years ago over the
Christmas holidays. My hope is that some reader will recognize the criptic
descriptions I give of them and get hold of me. Who knows, stranger things
have happened. Anyhow, to continue: both of the forementioned pipes had
unstained, "broken rough briar" to the bowls, bowl thickness on both were
about 1/2 " with inside diameter 1-1 1/4 ". Both had freestyle
bowls that were larger at top than the bottom and perhaps2-2 1/2 'high.
The smooth finish on the straght one was slighly darker than the smooth
finish on the curve. These particular pipes have personal memories for me
and I would be quite willing to repurchase or trade other Charatans, etc
for them. In any case, if the curent owner reads this, I am sure he/she
will remember them just by the location and circimstances of purchase.
Much thanks for any efforts and for the job you are doing with the Digest.

John

[ Good luck on recovering your pipes, John! -S. ]

Dear Steve,
	I'd like to see a shred of reason in this puritan wasteland.   
Could you send me Charles Whitebread's speech?  

	--Thanks

	Also, I think the time has come to give the digest some  
structure.  I know this will be a major chore, but better now than  
later.  By structure I simply mean: a definitive policy concerning  
advertisement, scrapping some of the boring stuff, and dropping the  
cigar smokers--even at the risk of offense.  It is clear you've been  
thinking about this.  

	Although I am an consumer purist (my only submission has been  
a call for localized, qualitative tobacco commerce) I think  
advertising would be *gasp* NICE.  Descriptions of blends or pipes by  
manufacturers would be extremely informative--so long as the  
solicitations are personalized and fit into the flow of discourse.  A  
general stipulation to this effect would be satisfactory for me, and  
I think other militant anti-corporate pipe smokers would agree.   
Anyway, something to think about--thanks for your time.

Yours truly, Chris Hamsher 

[ Speech sent, Chris.  Re cigar smokers: they have always been welcome
here, and will always remain so.  Re advertising: I think the existing
policy works pretty well; the problem was that it had been a while
since I'd read it. :-) Re "the boring stuff:" it's a big group, and
what's uninteresting to one member may be fascinating to another. My
advice is just to skip forward to the next line of ASCII pipes if
you're not interested in a particular article.  Thanks for your
comments! -S. ]

Steve + Fellow Pipe Smokers:

My English 250 Honors class at Purdue University is currently reading Moby
Dick by Herman Melville.  I thought I'd share a specific passage with
you all to let you ponder some classic American Literature while you puff
quietly on your pipes...
	"How now, this smoking no longer soothes.  Oh, my pipe!  Hard
	it must go with me if thy charm be gone!  Here have I been
	unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring, -aye, and ignorantly
	smoking to windward all the while;  to windward, and with such
	nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were
	the strongest and fullest of trouble.  What business do I have
	with this pipe?  This thing that is meant for sereness, to send
	up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn
	iron-grey locks like mine.  I'll smoke no more-"
			-Captain Ahab

Interesting, huh.  Mail me if you want to discuss it further.  Puff in
peace.

Greetings fellow smokers!

Alright...  I notice many PD members drop a note when they are soon to be 
going abroad.  I am heading off to China, the city of Tian'jin (about one 
hour Southeast of Beijing.)  I wanted to know if any Digest members have 
visited this country, and if so, if China has anything interesting 
available in the way of pipes.  I read that China produces more than half 
of the world's tobacco, and has more smokers than the U.S. has people, so 
I'm sure that pipe-smoking is probably a part of their culture.  Anyway, 
any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!

Steve,
I am enjoying the PD digest and have gotten a lot of good info. on place to
find good cigars and info. on pipe smoking.  I smoke both.

I have had a similiar experience here in Vacaville, CA  that some of the
other writers have about unfriendly shop owners or clerks.  The local on
here keeps trying to do a hard sell on the most expensive products he has
and when I went to the shop to buy a pipe, he did everything he could to
discourage me from smoking a pipe and encourage me to buy some cigars.
Mind you I love the cigars, but I wanted a pipe.  He even made comments
that pipe tobacco was very dangerous and I should not smoke it.  I have
decided that even though the shop is convient, I will not frequent it any
longer.

Most shops are very helpful and friendly and luckily I haven't had any
experiences of being discriminated against because I am a woman.  Although
when my husband and I go into a shop they always offer to assist him and he
tells them that I am the cigar/pipe smoker.  Then they assist me.  Also, in
one place they asked me what king of cigar my husband wanted.  They never
did that again.

Thank you again for the wonderful digest, I always look forward to getting
it each week.

Pipe and Tobacco Shoppe in Phoenix.  I can understand his anger over the 
matter, and I believe that it is unfortunate that his wife had to wait 
ten minutes before receiving attention while other (male) patrons were 
waited upon.  I was not present in the shop during his wife's visit, nor 
do I know Mr. Helmick or his wife (I will take his word that "she's the 
best"). However, I am very familiar with the shop in question, and 
believe that Ms. Helmick's experiences are certainly open to 
interpretations other than "discrimination." 
    I have visited over one hundred pipe and cigar stores, and have yet 
to encounter one that is more oriented to the customer than Ye Olde Pipe 
and Tobacco Shoppe.  Regarding women customers, I can report that in the 
scores of times I have visited, I have never observed the employees 
ignore female customers, fail to answer their questions, or wait on male 
customers in preference to female ones. In fact, I have often wondered if 
there was "discrimination" in favor of women customers, as the treatment 
of lady customers is quick, courteous and (if I may say) chivalrous.  I 
have sent my mother and sister to the store to make purchases on my 
behalf, and they have always reported a pleasant shopping experience.  I 
personally know of at least two female pipe smokers who frequent the 
store.
      It is true that when the store is VERY busy (as it always is on 
Saturdays in the winter), customers who have already made purchase 
selections or who have regular standing orders that merely need to be 
picked up are waited upon ("checked out," if you will) before customers 
who will require greater attention.  This sort of customer triage, which 
is obviously an expedient, sometimes occurs when the number of customers 
exceeds the number of people working in the store.  When this happens, 
customers looking for pipes are invited to look around on their own , and 
return to the counter if they have any particular questions.  This 
invitation can be made because EVERY new pipe in the store is available 
for examination by the customer without asking for a counter person's 
help (a policy that is rare these days).. All of the pipe display cases 
can be opened by the shopper and the pipes handled and examined by the 
customer.  This is true even of the high-grade pipes.  In a sense, the 
shop is self service for pipes.  Some patrons (such as myself) enjoy the 
opportunity to "graze" and drool over the briar, but some customers 
prefer to visit the store when it is less busy so that they may be waited 
upon.
     Since Ms. Helmick's visit to the store was on a winter's Saturday, I 
think it is quite possible that she misinterpreted what happened to her.  
Based on my own experiences with the shop, and my familiarity with the 
people who work there, I have NO DOUBT that this is so.  While I do not 
think that Ms. Helmick's experience should be ignored (I am certain that 
she would receive a heartfelt apology from the shop's owner for her long 
wait), I think that it is emotion rather than evidence that leads Mr. 
Helmick to characterize it as discrimination. 
     You, Steve, can, of course, put any notation or comment in the 
resource guide that you wish.  I do suggest that one, single isolated 
case warrants at least the phrase "one alleged episode" somewhere in your 
remarks.  I also suggest that you seek comment from Joyce Perry before 
inferring that the reason for her decision not to give you the address of 
YOP&amp;TS for the guide was because they discriminated against her (PD 
#207); she did not give you the addresses of the other stores in Phoenix 
either, just the phone numbers.
   Personally, i wish to recommend Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco Shoppe to all 
of the Pipe Digest readers, regardless of their gender, and to their 
spouses, sweethearts, and families as well, without regard to sex, race, 
creed, or national origin.  The store is a real tobacconist shop, and 
everyone who works behind the counter KNOWS tobacco, cigars and pipes.  
They don't sell cute novelty items.  I think I saw a mug on sale once 
there, but that's about it.  Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco carries the widest 
range of name-brand pipes in Arizona, and has one of the largest 
high-grade selections in the U.S., including Ashton, Dunhill, Castello, 
Savinelli Autos, Willmer, etc.  The store has won numerous local awards 
as the best smokeshop in Phoenix. I do think that they discriminate 
against minors, but only in the sale of tobacco products; you can buy as 
many pipe cleaners as you wish regardless of your age.
    
     By the way, I have no interest in the store except that of a very 
satisfied customer. In my opinion, Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco Shoppe is the 
finest smokeshop in the U.S.

Steve, 
  I finally got around to reading issue 210 of PD this week, and was puzzled 
by Mrs. Hemlick's experience at Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco Shop here in Phoenix. 
I have shopped there for nearly a decade and have never had a negative 
experience with the personnel, their attitudes, or their helpfulness. In fact, 
this shop was mentioned at out monthly meeting of lady cigar smokers last week 
as a "favorite" of many of the women in attendance.
  While I do not in any way discount her feelings, let me assure Mrs. Helmick 
that her experience with Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco does not reflect either the 
attitudes or treatment that I have experienced. Over the years, Rick Hopkins 
(owner) has proved himself to be a man of honesty, integrity, tact and 
sensitivity. It is my opinion that his employees also reflect these qualities.
While I admire the defense of your delightfully thoughtful wife, Jason, I wish 
you would have given them a second chance, or at least written them a personal 
letter before deep-sixing them publically. 
  Also please find attached my comments on Ye Olde posted to you in December 
of last year.

#207, which was sent on January 4, 1996. -S. ]

  Ye Olde Pipe and Tobacco Shop (602 955-7740) is a father-son operation 
that's been around for years. Rick Hopkins maintains a large and varied 
selection of cigars, pipes (new and estate) and RELEVANT smoking accessories. 
He and his employees are extremely knowledgable on all aspects of smoking and 
tobacco, and take great delight in teaching rookie smokers the art of pipes 
and/or cigars.

[ Given your and Ray's commendations, I'm going to delete my
cautionary note in the Guide.  It may well have been some reason other
than prejudice that caused Mrs. Hemlick to be treated with less than
the best care (especially around the seasonal madness in December.)
Not having witnessed the incident, I can't pass judgment, and would
not want to prejudice others.  Readers should judge the shop for
themselves.

Also, for the views of another woman pipe smoker (though not
specifically on Ye Olde), see Pat Christiansen's note above. -S. ]

Hi Steve,
    Welcome to Monday and the daily grind once again.  However, today I 
can reflect on pleasant memories of Saturday.  I had a great time. I 
wound up staying until around 6pm, just as most started packing their 
wares.  It was a real pleasure to meet you.  It was funny, I walked up 
to the folks at Fine Old Briars to put my name on their mailing list 
and whose name do you suppose was right above mine, well, yours.  So, 
at that point I knew you were in attendence, now I just had to locate 
you.  That was easy, just ask the Sailorman.  You, by chabce just 
happen to be standing at his table and voila, we were aquainted, just 
like that.  It was that kind of thing that makde this show a great one. 
 I enjoyed the fellowship with fine friends who I've met at the last 
three shows and it's good to see them comming back each year.  I 
applaud all who contributed and organized the show. 

    Did you see the mention you received in the premier issue of, Pipes 
&amp; Tobacco p.13 ?  Not bad at all, Steve, keep up the great work, we 
appreciate it.

    I bought three great pipes this year along with a bunch of tins of 
tobacco.  I managed to pick up a nice Castello 4K "Castello" and a nice 
Dunhill Danish Style Shell from Bob Hamlin.  I was also looking for my 
first Pre-trans Barling in a bent shape, which I found at another 
table, I forget the gent's name.  It's small but it will at least 
initiate me into the Barling mystique.  It was great seeing old freinds 
like Nikos Levin, who is one of the most sincere and genuine gentlemen 
that I have the privelage of knowing, as well as Tom Colwell, Rich 
Esserman, Sam and of course Sailorman Jack.  What would a show be 
without his great voice as MC ?  There was even a table taken by the 
guys from Puff-n-Stuff located in Flushing ,Queens which is pretty 
close to my neck of the woods.  I missed seeing Joe Nastri of Trinity 
East from Rockville Center.  He's a great guy and a good friend who I 
have the privelage opf seeing from time to time.  He, also is one of 
the most sincere and kindest gentleman that I have the privelage of 
knowing.  
    
    As you can tell, I had a great time !  I had better get to work now 
and let you go as well.  Hope to be hearing from you soon.  Keep up the 
good work and I'll be looking forward to the next issue.

<a name="24">Subject: Any good pipe shops/pipe smoking spots in Long Island, NY?</a>

Greetings,

I have been receiving Pipes Digest for about a year and a half, but
haven't really kept up with it since I graduated from college this
past May.  I never introduced myself to the list, so I guess now is as
good a time as any to do it.

I graduated from Cornell with a B.S. in biological
sciences/physiology, and will be attending medical school this fall.
I have smoke pipes and cigars on and off for about four years.  I have
two inexpensive pipes which hold more sentimental value than anything
else, and have smoked mostly mild Virginia and aromatic blends.  I
have tried Dunhill's Standard Medium Mixture, but only like to smoke
it once in a while.  As for cigars, my one and only is Nat Sherman's
Host selection, which I usually find to be quite mild and sweet.  I
have tried to find a similar tasting cigar, but have had no luck so
far; perhaps someone could recommend a mild, sweet cigar which is
relatively common at shops.  Since I have been back home, I haven't
really enjoyed a good bowl for lack of a suitable place to light up (I
am unable to smoke at home).

I had two questions that I hope someone would be able to answer.
First, where could I find some good pipe shops which have quality
tobacco blends on Long Island, and second, are there any good
restaurants, bars, or other establishments which are conducive to
pipe/cigar smoking on Long Island?

I appreciate the great job Steve has done with the Digest; after a
couple of hundred editions, he still finds the time to comment and
give advice on nearly every posting.  PD has added greatly to my
enjoyment of pipes, as it is my only link to the advice of more
experienced pipe smokers.  Keep up the good work, Steve!

Sincerely,
Tom Zimmerman

<a name="25">Subject: introduction etc...</a>

Here is another introduction.  I began smoking a pipe about 8 years ago.  I
was at a friends house, he had a small Petersen system pipe and I asked him
to tell me about it.  I had never smoked anything much less been around pipe
smoking.  He said that he like to smoke on cold winter evenings by the fire.
 However, this was in Houston Texas and cold winter evenings only happen a
few times a year.  My couriositiy was sparked.  The next time I was at the
mall I went into the pipe shop and bought a small sandblast Petersen system
pipe and some aromatic tobacco.  

I really enjoyed pipe smoking right from the start.  I got some good
information about the art of proper pipe smoking so I usually didn't have too
many problems.  I would occasionally buy cheap pipes and suffer the results a
few times then give up on the bad pipes.  My mother went on a trip to England
and brought back two pipes for me, one CAO mearshaum carved head and a Danske
Club Danish Briar in sort of a calabash shape.  These pipes both smoked
great.  Unfortunately I lost the mearshaum at some point moving from city to
city.

I moved from Texas to Boston to go to music school.  During my time there I
did not smoke my pipes much at all.  There was a good pipe shop in Cambridge
MA called "Earlich" or something like that.

When I finally moved to Berkeley CA a couple of years ago, I took up the pipe
once more.  The best thing that happed however was that I started to
experiment with tobaccos.  Up till that time I just smoked the same kind of
aromatic vanilla-type tobacco in bulk.  I was in a mood to try something
different so I bought some virginia pressed flake type tobacco called "London
Press" from Drucure &amp;Sons Ltd. pipe shop in Albany CA.  What a difference!  I
instantly knew that I had not really been experiencing real tobacco flavor
before with the aromatics.  This virginia was quite strong but the taste was
great and it seemed to get better as I smoked to the bottom of the bowl.  I
bought an English blend called "No.2131" from "Grants" pipe shop in San
Francisco.  I love the aroma of the English blends but I'm not always in the
mood to smoke them.  I found the english that I have smoke quite cool and dry
but I find that I gravitate toward the virginia side of things more often.

The best thing about pipe smoking around the S.F. Bay Area is the "Schmit's
Pub" or just the "Pub" in Albany CA.  This is truly a smokers haven.  The
place is an old house on a nice commercial street "Solano Ave." that has
English beers and ales on tap and in bottles, serves wine, espresso and sells
estate pipes (large selection - including Petersens) and pipe tobacco.
  There are three rooms the living room chairs and tables and lots of books
and magazines to read.   Pipe and cigar smoking is practically encouraged and
the Bay area Pipe club meets once a month on a sunday afternoon.  There are
also alot of cigarette smokers and their smoke does bother me but I can't
complain.  I really can't smoke my pipes at home so the "pub" is a great once
or twice a week treat. 

Here is a list of my pipes and tobaccos that I have now or have tried.  I
would like suggestions on what other tobaccos people think I might like.

Pipes

1. Petersen system standard sand blast 313 -  my first pipe and probly my
favorite, smokes well and I love to take this one hiking in the mountains
with me.

2. Danske Club Danish Briar in sort of a calabash shape- this pipe is the
biggest one in my collection.  It's a sit down pipe for me 
3. Petersen system standard  304 - this pipe is reserved for English style
tobaccos, it has a flat bottom so it can sit by itself (ugly but practical)

4. Andre small straight apple shape briar - a California maker that I got for
only $25 from the "Piedmont Tobacconist" in Piedmont CA.  This is one of my
favorites,  It is very light, even for it's size and just simply has a great
flavor.

5. Irish Second (Petersen second) straight billiard shape - the largest bowl
of any of my pipes.  For some reason the cake has built up better (more even)
on this pipe than the others.

I only smoke two or three times a week so each pipe gets ample rest.

Tobaccos

1. "London Press" from Drucqure &amp; Sons Ltd. in Albany CA - dark pressed
virginia , great flavor but a little strong for me sometimes, bites a bit if
I smoke it too fast.

2. "Virginia Light"  another pressed virginia from Druquers but lighter and
mellowed in taste.  The owner recommended it to me as an alternative to
"London Press"

3. Mac Baren Roll Cake De Lux - the only tin tobacco I have ever tried.  I
wanted to try a roll (twist) tobacco and I love this one.  I reads on the tin
"A de luxe roll-cake pipe tobacco of medium strength.  A blend of twisted
Virginia, Cavendish and perique tobaccos.  A precious mild pleasure."  I love
this tobacco, It has the natural flavor of virginia but it a slightly sweet
fruity aroma.  This is my favorite tobacco so far and I am really looking for
ward to trying more tin-tobaccos.  That's why I need recommendations. 

4. Grant's No. 2131 - an English blend, the only one I have ever tried.  I am
learning to enjoy it but I am more often in the virginia mood.  I think that
is is probly a medium strength english, the others in the store had a
stronger aroma.  I would like to try some more english blends.

5. Mate's Aromatic Blend - from Mates pipe shop in San Francisco.  The shop
keeper said that this house blend is really not an aromatic be cause there
are no flavorings added to it.  It does however have a vanilla aroma but a
very light one in the back ground and not at all like the aromatics that I
used to smoke.  This tobacco smokes quite well, it it very mild and I never
have to re-light it.

Well that all the tobaccos that I have tried I would like recommendations on
what people might think I would like.  My favorite store to window shop for
pipes is Sherlock's Haven in San Francisco.  They have many different tin
type tobaccos and I can't wait to try more.

Well I guess that's all for now.

thanks,

Morris Acevedo

Hi Steve,

I've been having something of a game with Mark Tinksy, which I
mentioned in the alt newsgroup, but which is progressing much better
than I ever anticipated.

It began with my trying to teach myself Ray Dream Designer (aka RD Studio),
a 3-dimensional design-painting program.  Normally, after whacking away at
tutorials, I like to begin with something I personally find interesting.

So I designed a pipe.  I didn't think too much of my first attempt, but Mark
found it interesting, asked for additional views, and the short of it is
that I wound up with a great looking pipe (big!  but smokes nice).  (The fun
of 3D rendering is that once an object is designed, it can be presented at
any angle or in any light or in any anything.)

That encouraged me to try a second, then a third.  By the time of my fourth
pipe, I finally figured out how to get the grain moving in the right
direction and a stem with a proper airhole throughout.  Of course, Mark was
also gaining and passing me by.  Not only was I doing a lot of additional
rendering I never expected, but I also got a pipe he called driftwood (after
a person in CA who thought of the original), which is more or less what the
pipe looks like.

Let me tell you, rendering "driftwood" with its multitude of driftwood
effects and holes is something for Advanced Rendering 1001, which I'll
probably put off for a few months at least.

In the meantime, I've struck back with a shape I haven't seen before: a
Grecian pipe--I call it the pipe of Ulysses, since if he ever smoked I'm
sure he'd like it. :)  The front resembles that aspect of a Grecian galley:
a forward prow.

For anyone interested, the sequence of designs begins at

  <a href="http://www.asb.com/usr/chet/3d.htm">http://www.asb.com/usr/chet/3d.htm</a>

and continued through to  3d5.htm

I've also included two photographs of Mark's versions of his subsequent
pipes on 3d.htm and 3d3.htm.

&gt;is that the cheap drug store pipes are made from the interior of the briar
&gt;burl which is dense and relativeatly grain free.Consequently it doesn't
&gt;absorb moisture like the outer surface of the burl (plateau) which is
&gt;lightweight, porous and beautifully grained. It's the latter that's used for
&gt;more expensive pipes and as any seasoned pipe smoker will attest, well worth
&gt;the extra price.

Now, read on with an open mind and understand that I don't intend to raise
doubt about what Al says, and in fact would kind of like someone to confirm
it.  Right now, I just do not know what to believe yet:

I would like to think that what Al says is true, because I have a devil of a
time with this problem.  I would like to find some way to enjoy my smoking
without having to deal with the melodious twitter that emanates from the
small frog pond that forms in the bowl whenever I smoke tobacco that isn't
cracklingly dry.  If that means buying a particular kind of pipe (expensive
or not), I'll do it--

Until now, the only advice that I've been able to find useful was that of
Paul Spaniola in Flint, Michigan.  He and he son, Dan have been smoking
pipes for over a hundred years between them (no kidding).  They claim that a
pipe does not need to be "rested", as is commonly advised.  They say that
you can smoke the same pipe all day long if you like, but you do need to let
it cool before you reload it.  Dan says that he keeps two pipes around
during the day in the shop there, and he switches back and forth.  This is
as close to "rotating" his pipes as he comes.  They say that the "pipe
rotating" myth comes from pipe salesmen.

But they are both real proponents of keeping pipe cleaners handy and
swabbing the stem down to the bowl a couple/three times while smoking.  I
don't know...maybe they make more money on pipecleaners than they do on a
good pipe ;)

Anyway, the Spaniolas were extremely helpful, good people.  I highly
recommend anyone in Flint, Michigan to brave the city streets down to their
shop.  It's truly a unique experience that you won't find just anywhere.  Be
very nice, and you'll get a personal tour of the pipe museum--a tour that is
different for everyone that gets to see it because what you see depends on
what Paul decides to pick up and talk about.  Nearly every pipe in there has
a great story behind it.

But back to the gurgling issue-- What Al said does sound like a plausible
explanation, and in fact would answer my old, ever present question, "What
is really going on when a pipe is 'resting' ?"  Maybe a pipe needs to "rest"
because it simply takes time to dry out--and good briar really does have a
good absorbent quality and ability to soak up and dry up an infinite number
of times.

Al, where did you get your information on that?  Or does anyone else have
any other comments on the subject?  As I said, I'd like to beleive that the
answer to my problem is simply to get a good quality pipe, and I'll always
have a great smoke.  Until then, I'm finding that I simply have to let my
tobacco dry out quite a bit.  It's a fine line, though, between dried out
just enough for proper tamping, and tamping it only to find tobacco dust
left waiting to be lit.  &lt;sigh&gt;

Looking forward to hearing more input on this subject.

Hi Steve,
This is my first attempt at writing to a mail group so I hope you will be
understanding. After reading the above article I called the company and
spoke with Mrs. Casillas(Maria?).She was a delight to converse with, both
courteous and informative. I ordered a box of Corona Longs and they arrived
in two days by Priority U.S. Mail. I and a couple of friends smoked some and
all agreed that they were very good. They smoked smooth with no bite, and
had a pleasant aroma. I believe they are well worth the money and will order
more. One small negative, the cigars are not packed very tight and smoke a
little fast, but NOT hot(IMHO). One other item, the Blue Ox Cigar Society of
Oscoda meets every Tuesday at 6:30 PM in the Toby Jug. If any members happen
to be in Northeast MI, E-mail me and I will happy to give directions. Maybe
we can even get in some fishing. My finger is getting tired, so thanks for

Steve,
Enjoyed the digest for the past few months and thought I would contribute a
little information. In #210 and #211 a few people mentioned pipe smoking in
the movies. I just  wanted to tell everyone interested about an old movie
staring Cary Grant and Melvin Douglas, "Mr. Blandings builds his dream
house". Both gentlemen smoke a pipe continuely through the movie and just
about everyone else does too. It is a comedy about a family building their
first house and all the problems they encounter. The carpenters, painters
even the well digger are all puffing on a pipe. It is a very entertaining
 movie and a joy to watch everyone with a pipe, smoking when and where they
like. Certainly makes you aware how much things have changed. You can catch
the movie on cable on AMC or TNT.

Hi Steve,

Thanks for sending me the digest.  I have enjoyed the readings.  I have 
a question?  (keep in mind that I am blind)  How can I light my pipe 
without scorching the edges?  I have tried everything I can think of.  
When I am at home I use matches, bowl straight up.  I touch the tip of 
the match to one side of the bowl inside and puff and bring the match 
around following it around inside the bowl.  When I am out, I use a 
Zippo.  I have a lot of facial hair so I have to tip the bowl down and 
to the side so I wont burn my hair.  I dont't like butane lighters 
because thy burn too hot,  and I can't control them like a Zippo.  Have 
any suggestions?  Thanks again

[ I really don't know, Jude.  Perhaps it would help to fill the bowl
only partially, and use the rim to guide the match.  Are there any
other blind members who could help? -S. ]

From: John Martindale &lt;???????????@??????.???&gt;

Steve,

I would like to thank you for the digest!  I have read most of the
issues and greatly enjoyed them.  As for myself, I have been smoking a
pipe on and off for about 3 years and this is my first contribution to
the digest...

I prefer the classic English pipes in the billiard shape.  My collection
is equally split between sandblasts and naturals. I own about 25 pipes,
including a very nice Boer calabash and a few clays.  I also own several
Ashtons, Dunhills, and Ferndowns.  The Ferndown is my favorite pipe
because I believe that Ferndown offers the highest-quality English pipe
for the lowest price.  Your readers need to know that Iwan Ries has a
decent inventory of Ferndown pipes and has a continuing close-out sale
of these pipes for just $75 to $100 each.  These are beautifully made,
really excellent smoking pipes at ridiculously low prices.  If you are a
pipe smoker looking for a high-quality, English hand-made pipe, look no
further.  I have purchased three Ferndowns myself from their Chicago
store and each has quickly become a treasured possession.

With regard to pipe tobacco in general, IMHO, pipe tobacco (especially
aromatic mixtures) seems to require a minimal amount of humidification. 
I have found that most of the mixtures I purchase are either completely
dried out or completely over-humidified.  It seems that pipe tobacco
absorbs moisture like a sponge, making it easy to over-humidify the
mixture.  And, if the mixture is too wet, keeping the bowl lit is next
to impossible.  But how much moisture is enough?  Take a large pinch in
your hand and sift the leaves through your fingers.  There should only
be a slight (hardly noticeable) amount of moisture in the leaf.  When
you pack and tamp your bowl, there should be a very definite "springy
feeling" to the mixture.  If the mixture is not very "springy," the leaf
is over-humidified and will not smoke well.  Purchase a pouch of Carter
Hall or other "drugstore" brand and you'll find that these mixtures are
sold in sealed foil pouches that initially, have a near perfect amount
of moisture:  not bone dry, yet far from damp.  For my tastes, unlike
cigars, I feel it is better to maintain pipe tobacco more on the dry
side than the wet side.

With regard to specific blends and brands.  On the aromatic side, I like
Iwan Ries' 3-Star Blue and their China Black Fire-Cured mixture.  3-Star
Blue is cube cut so it stays lit very easily.  Also, it seems to have a
small amount of Latakia, which is nice.  Its great aroma matches its
taste (which seems to have a very slight trace of licorice).  The 3-Star
blends are certainly unique in that they really do "straddle the fence"
between aromatics and English blends.  The China Black brands are
probably one of the best buys in aromatics.  J-R Cigars (800-JR-CIGAR)
was recently selling the China Black blends for $5/pound!!  I also like
Erinmore Flake, Captain Black (white pouch), and the tremendous Danish
offerings from Finck Cigars in San Antonio, TX.  Carey's Cinnamon and
Raisin blend is nice also.  I too have experimented with Cornell and
Diehl's blends, but I was somewhat disappointed.  The blends I sampled
(100, 300, 414, 700A, 712, ) all shared a common bland taste and their
room aromas imparted a simple tobacco, almost cigarette-type smell in
the air which my wife absolutely hated.  I'm not saying that I think the
C&amp;D blends are bad -- they are just not my cup of tea.  I can say that I
was quite impressed with C&amp;D's service and their friendly owner, Craig. 
On the English side, I prefer Dunhill's Early Morning Pipe and
(especially) Rattray's Highland Targe.  Both are fabulously-light blends
that burn dry all the way down and taste the same at the end as the
beginning.  Great stuff.  Finally, I think that Finck's Istanbul blend
offers slightly fuller taste, is also very mild, and is considerably
cheaper.  Highly recommended!

Regards,

John

Hi Steve: I was beginning to think I was one of the last pipe smokers
until I received your Digest. It's GREAT!
I have a few questions which I just have to ask, since I have no one
else to ask.....
I used to smoke a tobacco called Escudo. They have disappeared totally,
I believe they went bankrupt. They were an English Company...Is there a
tobacco that even comes close to Escudo, that I can purchase? I miss
this tobacco beyond words. I have yet to find anything like it. Why was
it so unique?
Also questions in the Digest regarding the inhaling of Pipe Tobacco....I
inhale my pipe tobacco, not constantly, but usually after first lighting
up, and maybe once during a smoke. I have done this for 30 years. Also,
regarding cigarettes, I find it absolutely impossible to inhale
cigarette tobacco, and I've tried. It makes me very dizzy, and causes me
to become nausious. There is definitely something vicious in cigarette
tobacco that is not in Pipe Tobacco. My body tells me this. Also, I
never cough from pipe tobacco, but find the sensation of inhaling it
delicious. Sorry to say this, but it's the truth for me..
Also, has anyone ever heard what happened to all the mid-priced Danish
Pipes, such as Jost. Have they gone bust?
Thanks,
Rich Reitz

     Dear Steve and coleagues,
     
     At first, let me thank You for your great work and interesting reading.
     I am 27 years old male - pipe smoker for 5 years. What bothers me is the
     fact that I can not get any closer information about some of my pipes - I 
     acquired from my grand father. May be someone from this group will 
     provide information. All of this set of pipes are bryars (probably 
     not younger than 30 years) of following trade marks: 
                 Windsor,Chevron,Belami,Monte Bello.
     Also, I bought myself Italian pipe Aldo Morelli one year ago. Can anyone 
     tell me wether this stuff is considered good or not in more experienced 
     circles. I personaly tend to appreciate cool smoke of Belami and Windsor.
     
     I would like add my point of view to discusiion wether filter pipes are 
     worth smoking or not. I guess that filter pipes are better for 
     unexperienced pipe smokers ( they are able to absorb the leak), but for 
     the experienced ones will appeciate "convensional" pipes for their 
     straight taste.

Prefer larger briars with a vanilla cavendish.  AM in the military and with
the new rules they are somewhat rabid about smoking inside so my normal
nicotine fix during the day is via cigarettes.  Do look forward to that
commute home -- get out of Detroit traffic and then have a half hour of
'calmness'.  All this talk of keeping a pipe lit doesn't apply to me -- one
match and I'm going -- just have to worry about smoking to fast...I guess
too much living in the fast lane.
Several years ago I put my pipes up, and just like any other endangered
species, the local tobacconist went out of business.  Hoping to find some
tobaconnists in the Southeast Michigan area via the Digest.
Now I'm back and trying to get away from the demon cigarette...be retiring
from the military soon and hoping the life style change will help.
Thanks for the web page...been reading thru (and enjoying) the back issues.
When I was going to college in Brooklyn (late 60s) seems there was a pipe

		      Starting a Pipe Collection
				  by
			     Mike McCain

Rule one: you must spend a great deal of money to develop a good pipe
collection.  Rule two: you must own a lot of pipes to have a
collection.  Rule three: you must possess "collectible" pipes to have
a collection.

Although you may have heard them before, not one of these statements
is true.  They're myths, not rules.  In fact, many pipe collectors
take great delight in proving that exactly the opposite can be true.

A collection can be based on any concept you choose, limited only by
your desire and imagination.  It can focus on Kaywoodies, patent
Dunhills, Upshall billiards, Becker sandblasts, bent bulldogs,
freehands, Christmas pipes, meerschaums, clays or anything else you
want.  All collections have one thing in common, however...instead of
unstructured accumulations of pipes, they are assembled with a
specific intent or purpose in mind.

"So what," you might respond, "I'm a pipe smoker, not a collector."

But it's possible that you really are a collector, albeit
unintentionally.  For example, if you tend to buy some pipes over
others because of a particular make you prefer, you're beginning a
brand-name collection.  If you seek out mostly rhodesians or Oom Pauls
or any one particular style, you're starting a shape collection.  If
you primarily look for pipes having a common theme or distinctive
feature, you've begun a motif collection.

Why not concentrate your pipe purchases around such a preference from
now on?  As you become a collector with an intentional focus, you can
avoid frustration, save money and have more fun in the process.

Getting started in this hobby of ours seems easy enought, just find a
place that sells pipes, pick one which appeals to you and buy it.
Most pipe smokers begin this way.  I did, too.  I bought my first pipe
in 1967 and it didn't take long for me to invent an incredible number
of excuses to justify getting more, either from a tobacco shop,
through the mail or at a pipe show.  If I saw it, liked it and could
afford it (and sometimes when I couldn't) I impulsively bought it,
irrespective of brand, shape, size, finish or any other special
consideration.

After a while, though, I found I was acquiring and smoking certain
pipes exclusively.  All my others were gathering dust and I was
getting no enjoyment out of owning them.  Does this sound familiar?
Thus do pipe collections often begin.

An understanding of HOW to start a collection must include the WHY and
the WHAT of collecting.  To these ends, we need to ask ourselves what
we expect out of a pipe.  I think most of us will agree that pipes can
be expected to perform as many as three roles: they're for smoking,
stroking, and selling or swapping.  The degree to which your
particular expectations are fulfilled will determine your level of
enjoyment and affect what you choose to collect.

Above all, pipes are made for smoking.  Think about what you smoke
most often.  Do you prefer the comfort of vulcanite stems, smaller air
holes, classic shapes and the taste of oil-cured briar, as
characterized by major English brands?  Or do you like the durability
of lucite mouthpieces, larger air holes, more "stylish" shapes and the
taste of air-cured wood typical of Italian pipes?  How about the
artistic qualities of Danish freehands?  Or do you primarily enjoy the
absorbency and beauty of meerschaums?  The smoking characteristics of
a canadian, for example, versus a bent apple?  The feel of a deep
sandblast, as opposed to the visual delight of birdseye grain?  If you
depart very far from your preferences, your expectations may not be
fulfilled and you ultimately could be disappointed.  Collecting
minimizes this risk.

Some pipes are made to be stroked.  You'll occasionally see those rare
pieces with carving so magnificent, or grain so straight and tight, it
brings you to your knees.  More than just smoking instruments, they
are sculptures, works of art.  There are those which literally are
pieces of history, as well.  It's difficult to fire up a stroker.
Invariably, they cost a lot more than the day-to-day smoker.

That brings up their third role: pipes can be sold or swapped.  What
is a fair price for a particular pipe?  If pre-smoked, how does its
condition affect its marketability?  Is it in demand; can you trade it
for another of equal value?  If you (or your estate) must sell it, how
much of your investment will be returned?  Some enthusiasts are able
to fund acquisitions for their collections through prudent and
informed swapping, buying and re-selling at a profit!  At the very
least, if you're knowledgeable and careful about what you're
doing--which are virtues of collecting--you won't take a financial
beating.

A pipe must fill at least one of these roles, or you won't be happy
with it.  Ideally, it will fill two.  If it fills all three, ah,
that's the stuff pipe dreams are made of.

Knowing what to collect is problematic, according to one point of
view, because there are so many options.  From another perspective,
deciding what to collect is as simple as concentrating on what you
like.

Brand-name collections have been built around Dunhill, Parker,
Barling, Charatan, Ashton, Comoy's, Baldi, Castello, Caminetto,
Radice, Ascorti, Amorelli, Jacopo, Larsen, Preben Holm, Stokkebye,
Kaywoodie, WDC, Edwards, Butera, Frey, Peterson, Tsuge, meerschaums
carved by Beckler and Sabri, and many more.  Collectors of a
particular brand usually will try to get different shapes, sizes,
finishes, grades, periods of production and limited editions.

Shape collections can focus on canadians, bulldogs, billiards,
dublins, pokers, lovats, pots, princes or any other style that's made.
Too, there are collectors who prefer only freehands.  The objective
here is to obtain a representation of different brands.

Motif collections have included egg-in-claw carved meerschaums,
giants, gadget pipes, carved heads, pipes carved in the shapes of
flowers, those carved with a "dripping wax" finish, pipes with bamboo
shank extensions, Christmas pipes and erotic meerschaums, to cite only
a few examples.

Many collectors concentrate even more specifically, such as on GBD
Uniques, patent Dunhills, Dunhill's shape 120, Dunhill ODAs,
pre-transition Barlings, Sasieni Dovercourts, Castello Greatlines,
Savinelli Autographs, Gemline Jacopos, Caminetto New Dears, Ben Wade
Danish Hand Models, pre-WWII briars, pre-Republic Petersons, pipes
made in the USA and English tan sandblasts.

Some collect by type of material other than briar or meerschaum, like
clay, porcelain, corncob, pyrolitic graphite, cherrywood, hickory,
olivewood, rosewood, bone, antler, ivory, stone and metal, or by
origin, such as African, Asian and American Indian pipes.

Contrasted to contemporary pipes, collecting antiques is a specialty
unto itself with its own opportunities and pitfalls.  A great tutorial
on this subject is the book, A Complete Guide to Collecting Antique
Pipes (now out of print) authored by Ben Rapaport.  More about Ben
later.

Now, for these reasons, and with these kinds of alternatives, how do
you go about starting a pipe collection?

Here's one way to begin.  Spread all your pipes across a table and
pull out those you like the best and smoke most frequently, the ones
you automatically turn to in good times and bad.  In all probability
they will be similar in some fashion, be it brand, shape, finish,
tobacco chamber geometry or whatever.  These will form the nucleus of
your collection.  Also, pick up the ones having a lot of sentimental
value to you.  These are keepers, too.  Unload everything else; you
weren't enjoying them much anyway, right?  Do some swapping if you
have the opportunity.  Then, sell the rest individually or wholesale
them all at once, to generate funds to buy more pieces for your new
collection.

Going through the same excercise I quickly grabbed those pipes I used
constantly, which were of the same brand, had the same tobacco chamber
taper and the same air hole diameter and which, therefore, smoked
similarly.  I also kept that first pipe I bought and, fearing a fate
worse than death if I let it go, the one my wife gave me for a wedding
present.  All the others I wholesaled to a pipe dealer.  Admittedly,
sending them off was scary at the time, but in retrospect it was the
smartest thing I've ever done in this hobby.  I had not been enjoying
them, and by turning them into quick cash I was able to buy pipes that
have given me both pleasure and value.

The next steps are visualizing where you want to go with your
collection, determining how much you can spend on it and setting your
goals accordingly.  If you have chosen a certain brand, learn about
its shapes, finishes, size and grade designations, and nomenclature
and logo variations.  Budgetary realities may cause you to focus on a
particular grade or finish of that brand.  If you've selected a
specific shape to collect, find out what companies, present and past,
either make or have made it.  To economize, you might decide to obtain
pieces from just one country of origin initially.

Know the difference between the asking price and the "street cost" for
new and used pieces.  With few exceptions you'll get what you pay for,
so go after the best you can afford within your collecting preference;
quality is more important than quantity.  Although quality doesn't
always have to be expensive, it's a good idea to maintain a
descriptive record of acquisition prices, replacement costs and
related facts for insurance and estate purposes.

Some collections aren't affected one way or another by finances,
they're created by necessity.  A good example was my dad, a pipe
smoker for more than fifty years.  When declining health and a
partially paralyzing condition confined him to a wheelchair, all his
priorities changed.  He needed a rough-finished pipe that was easy to
grasp and it had to have a super thick stem and bit, among other
attributes.  The one pipe that filled all his needs was the Savinelli
Estella.  Out went the Dunhills, Charatans, Comoy's, Caminettos,
Petersons, meerschaums, etc. and in came the Estellas.  Due to his
physical limitations, his pipes were one of the few joys he had left
in this world and he pronounced his collection as perfect, each and
every pipe being exactly what he wanted.  He wished every pipe smoker
could be so fortunate.

No matter which route you take, remember to focus on your preferences,
have a strategy for attaining your goals and be selective.  Don't
amass pipes at random, or you'll end up back where you started.

There are numerous guides to hasten your collecting journey.  Computer
users with a modem and enabling software have quick access to a
variety of on-line pipe information resources, but it seems redundant
to list them in this forum.  You also can subscribe to the increasing
number of pipe-related periodicals available via snail mail, such as
A&amp;M Gazette (47758 Hickory, Apt. 22305, Wixom, MI 48393) and Pipe

If you're lucky enough to have a good tobacconist nearby, take
advantage of it.  However, many of us have no choice but to patronize
mail-order firms.  Among those which regularly send out color photos
and descriptions of new and used pipes for sale are the Pipe
Collectors Club of America (P.O. Box 5179, Woodbridge, VA 22194-5179),
NML Pipes Direct (12159 Cuddington Court, West Palm Beach, FL 33414),
Aroma's (4936 Windsor Hill, Windcrest, TX 78239) and Edward's (338
Spanish Village, Dallas, TX 75248).  PCCA is an active participant on
the Internet; NML is well-known to on-line pipe enthusiasts, too, as
is Marty Pulvers (Sherlock's Haven, One Embarcadero Center, San
Francisco, CA 94111) with their WWW pipe offerings.  Moreover, NML,
Aroma's, Edward's and Sherlock's buy quality used pipes and
recondition them for resale.  Send a descriptive list of your unwanted
pieces to get their cash offers.

Finally, go to pipe shows; you won't believe the wonderful time you'll
have.  From all these sources, and others they will lead you to,
you'll gain knowledge, find trading partners and have great
opportunities to view and obtain pipes for your collection.

On the other hand, maybe you have absolutely no intention of spending
money on long-distance phone calls, postage and travelling to distant
tobacco shops and pipe shows, looking for some elusive pipe to fill a
gap in a collection.  It might be that you're perfectly content with
everything you have, thank you, and all this nonsense about collecting
seems kind of silly.  Or perhaps you have no desire or need to
self-impose any restrictions whatsoever on your pipe choices.  If
you're happy, that's what counts.  There are no rules dictating how to
enjoy our hobby, and doing your own thing is what this is all about.

But those of us who are collectors know what it is to experience the
fun of The Hunt and the thrill of The Find.  We help one another
achieve our respective collecting goals, swap on a handshake and make
lifelong friends along the way.  We smoke and/or stroke every one of
our pipes.  We're proud that our collections are more than just the
sums of their individual components.  We're preserving a bit of
culture and history in what we collect.  And in doing so, we become
more knowledgeable and careful about the pipes we're acquiring, thus
protecting our investments in them.

As you light another bowl of tobacco, think about what pipe you might
acquire next and your reasons why.  Although an accumulation of pipes
can offer a great deal of pleasure, a lot of us believe that a
collection of pipes can provide even more.

[ADMIN] Some of the members who were new last issue may have received
some unsolicited email.  The sender did so without knowing the
Digest's policy, and has apologized for doing it (see later this
issue.)  My apologies also, and any member who wishes to keep his or
her address confidential only has to ask.  The mailing list is, of
course, kept sealed in a mayonnaise jar in NBC Studios, awaiting the
return of Karnak. :-)

[ASTRONOMY REDUX] I'd venture to say that Comet 1996 B-2 Hyakutake has
not been a disappointment to anyone who had the chance to see it under
clear skies!  At perigee, its tail covered more than 50 degrees of the
sky, stretching from the Big Dipper to Arcturus (in the pipe-puffing
constellation Bootes.) Assuming I have the energy after editing this
(it's 10:20 PM now, and still a bit to go), I'll take my new 6-inch
Dobsonian reflector and a GBD "Century" out to the field, and see if I
can find it again.

For those who missed the "hairy star" the first time, don't worry.
After a long vacation in the Oort cloud, it'll return in probably 9600
years or so. In the meantime, there will be time to enjoy many a good
smoke, which I personally find an aid to the quiet contemplation of
the Infinite. (Also helps in the construction of sliding dovetails and
collar ties, the writing of a dissertation, or just mowing the lawn.)

And for further astronomical kapnismology, see the Quote of the Week,
below.

Hi Steve and all the 2000 and more subscribers of the PD,

As usual, thanks to you Steve. Your opening comments always have been a
pleasure to read. This time (PD #212) especially so.

I am a little confused with this rapid flow of information bombing us
to-day. As a rule I check both the *a.s.p.* group and this *PD*. To-day
there are too many interesting mails to answer! At the time I joined in, the
number of subscribers was less than 1000, perhaps about 700 - 800. I think
all this has happened in a couple of years. Now we are more than 2000!

I only tell you about my *latest* delights in this endangered field of
smoking pipe.

In Italy, in a town called Bologna there works a true craftsman (an artisan)
who has dedicated his life to pipe making.
I bought a sturdy Dublin Natural *Straight Grain*, ("Infiammata") by him.
This happened by the help of PD, his home page in the www, and a couple of
e-mails we changed. To-day I am proud to own a pipe carved by this man,
Alberto Bonfiglioli. He does not write English as his first language, but
you can communicate with him. Alberto wrote me that he lets the briar dry
from 6 to 10 years before he carves it. I must say that I am fully pleased
with his work. I never has seen a more perfect straight grain as the one I
got from Mr. Bonfiglioli. This far I have only smoked three times 1/3 of
bowl with it and it is great! I look forward to the future pleasures with
this Dublin. The thickness of briar is a good 12 mm (about  a half inch) in
the top of the bowl.

BTW, Alberto does send you a photo of your pipe prior to your payment, so
you do have an opportunity to check if it is *the one*.

The other delight I want to tell you deals with tobacco. I think that I have
found perhaps one of the choiciest mixture during the 30 years of smoking
pipe this far. 
I must thank Craig Tarler (Cornell&amp;Diehl) about this. I am speaking about
#531 (Yale Mixture) in their list. It consists of mainly various Virginias
and Latakia and it is really good! 
Tastes may vary, but I am sure that if you are fond of English mixtures you
will like this one. As Craig describes it: "Rich but not sweet, like
Cabernet Sauvignon".
I want to mention that I have no connection what so ever with signor
Bonfiglioli or mr. Tarler other than a happy client.

The price of my Dublin was about 100 $(US).

The price of one pound of *Yale mixture* is in the USA $16.75 (pressed) plus
$5.00 shipping and handling for the first pound. Of course I living in
Europe had to pay a little more.

Last but not least I want to inform those of you who have not yet contacted
this page:

<a href="http://www.asb.com/usr/chet/">http://www.asb.com/usr/chet/</a>

Do it now! Chet's page is full of beautiful graphics and information about
pipes and various other things. Especially for me living near the North Pole
his photos and short stories are fascinating.

Dry ashes!

[ Besides which, I can testify that both Alberto and Craig are super
guys!  (Each has a red cape and a large "S" on his chest. :-) BTW,
Craig also has some interesting news on a new _non_ - tobacco blend,
later this issue; can't wait to try it!  -S. ]

Dear Steve:

While I have been reading PD for a few months, it took Chris
Hamsher's letter to cause me to write.

I am an occasional cigar smoker who loves to read about cigars
when not able to smoke them.  I will not delve into my initial
reaction to Mr Hamsher's "drop the cigar smokers" comment, but
wanted to thank you for emphasizing your welcome of us to your
pages.

I skip much of the PD where it concerns pipes--that is my way
of "structuring" the PD--and I echo your advice to Mr Hamsher
to "skip forward."  It is a big group and you can rest assured
that we all appreciate your efforts to include everyone.

Thank you again.

Sincerely,

Bill Comer

<a name="4">Subject: PD Submission</a>

Steve,

  Thanks for the great job on the digest.  It is truly relaxing to read 
about a pleasant subject for a few minutes, as opposed to the usual array 
of e-mail I receive.  Unfortunately, I read the PD at work, so I can't 
enjoy a smoke as I read it.
  I wanted to pass along a hint about humidification to the other members 
of the group.  I use a combination of table salt and water to regulate 
humididty.  This subject was actually brought up on the 
alt.smokers.cigars newsgroup a while back, but I have been using this 
technique for a few years now with excellent success.  The idea is that a 
solution of salt and water will maintain a relative humididty of 75% in a 
closed environment.  My implementation of a large, cheap, and effective 
cigar humidor is as follows:  First get a Rubbermaid container, or similar 
airtight vessel (i.e. Tupperware, etc.).  Next take a shot glass and fill 
about half way with common salt.  Then wet the salt with water, to make a 
slushy mixture.  The trick is to have more salt than water; there should 
always be plenty of solid salt in the glass for this to work.  Place the 
glass in the container with your cigars, and seal it up.  This also works 
great for keeping containers of pipe tobacco.  In this manner I have a 50 
cigar humidor that cost less than $10.  Not pretty to look at, but 
effective for a poor Ph.D. student.  I will also note that this technique 
will only work in a closed environment.  It would not work in a standard 
wooden humidor, due to the porousness of the wood.  
  On another note, I tried some of Dunhill's Elizabethan Mixture the 
other day, and fell in love.  Does anyone know what is in this?  I 
beleive it is just a mixture of several Virginias.

-Scott Bukofsky

[ Been using this technique for a while.  How often, BTW, should one
change the water? -S. ]

I'm answering my own question that appeared in the last issue of PD.
I've found the 'new' address for Kapp and Peterson, which is as follows:

Kapp &amp; Peterson Limited
Peterson House
Sallynoggin Co. Dublin
Ireland
Their telephone numbers are 01-2851011     fax: 01-2856593

[ Thanks for the updated address, Ed!  BTW, is it properly Eire or
Ireland? I suppose that mail addressed to either will end up in the
proper place... -S. ]

From: ??.?????@??????????.??? (Ed Price)
<a name="6">Subject: Smoking Wet</a>

I just have to throw my 2 cents in on the recent question of pipes that
smoke wet.  While I realize that quality of briar is a major factor,
most new smokers don't realize that pipe tobacco can also contribute to
the problem, and may be the sole cause of the problem if your pipe is a
quality, absorbent pipe which is treated 'right'.

When I started drinking beer, I started with lite beers, now I drink
Guinness, almost exclusively.  With tobacco, I started on sweet, light
aromatics.  I had been smoking a vanilla blend "Aristocrat" for about 3
months, using many matches to keep it lit, and experiencing a flood
inside my pipe each time.  I happened to wander into Edward's Pipes and
Tobacco here in Dallas (a branch of their larger Richardson store)
looking for a little more Aristocrat, because I really did enjoy the
taste (at least the first 2/3 of the bowl, after that it became bitter).
After explaining that I was looking for Aristocrat, but would be
interested in something that smoked drier, the employee there at the
time asked me if I had ever tried any "non-cased" aromatics, and filled
my pipe with the Edward's French Vanilla, the tobacco he preferred.  He
explained that this tobacco was flavored by storing the tobacco with
vanilla beans for an extended period of time, not by spraying it with
chemical flavorings.  The chemical layer on the tobacco tends to add to
the wet smoking experience.  The non cased vanilla tobacco had a more
subtle vanilla taste, but also a more rich tobacco  taste.  It burned
cooler in my pipe, and all of a sudden I was using 3 matches to a bowl,
instead of the 8-10 I had been in the past.

Another source of wet smoking, and difficulties keeping my pipe lit were
explained to me.  I have two ceramic Comoy's pipe tobacco humidors. I
had been routinely adding water to the small sponge humidifying agent in
the lid, ever time it dried.  The result was that the tobacco was being
over humidified, making it harder to keep lit, and making it smoke
wetter.

Although still a novice pipe smoker (and before that, no kind of smoker
at all!) of less than a year, my pipe collection has grown to 4, and
will continue to grow.  The discovery of this non-cased aromatic tobacco
has helped keep me a pipe smoker, and I would encourage anyone looking
for a cooler drier smoke to contact Edward's about their line of
non-cased aromatics.  By the way, I do not have any connection with the
store, other than sharing a first name, and being a loyal customer.

My name is Mac McKenney.  I have been smoking a pipe for about 25
years, but I have been trying to use the Internet for a few short
months now.  I have immensely enjoyed receiving and reading the Pipes
Digest.  I usually smoke Peterson's during the winter months, but I
gravitate toward Missouri Meerschaums when I work in the yard.  I used
to have little or no trouble finding them without putty and shellac,
but haven't had any luck these past two or three years.  Can anyone
out there recommend a source?

Steve and fellow PDer's,
       I've just been reading the mystery "The Bookman's Wake" by local
author John Dunning and came across a passage that made me pause (the
character Cliff Janeway, former Denver policeman, now bookstore owner and
collector has just stumbled upon a very ripe corpse: 
       "I moved around the table, watching where I walked.  A wave of rotten
air wafted up in a cloud of flies. 
       I tasted the bile.  What I didn't need now, after compromising the
first scene, was to throw up all over this one.
       The lighter fluid might help.  I know it's an evil solvent; I've
heard it can get into your blood through the skin and raise hell with your
liver.  But it's stronger by far than Vicks, and even the smell of a
cancer-causing poison was like honeysuckle after what I'd been smelling.
       I put my handkerchief on the table, then turned the plastic bottle on
its side and pried open the squirt nozzle.  Liquid flowed into the rag...
       I made the wet rag into a bandana.  Found a roll of cord and cut off
a piece, then tied it over my mouth and nose..."
       
       I guess my concern is: should I be concerned about the fluid in the
Zippo pipe lighter that I carry around in my pocket eventually damaging my
liver?  Granted, the character in the story is inhaling the naptha directly
- something any intelligent person would never do (unless the alternative is
to inhale rotten corpse!).  But anyway, are there any chemists out there?
What do you think?  Maybe I should stick with my Diamond matches?

Pipes Digest is very unique in its presentation on smoking high quality 
tobbacco, especially in pipes. This idea of pipe smoking interests me a 
lot. I have smoked cigars for at least 5 months now and was intrigued by 
Pipes. I have a local tobacco shop in my area, and I was wondering if 
someone could tell me what the best kind of pipe to buy when I don't want 
to spend more than $30. And what kind of pipe tobacco to purchase. I love 
cigars, yet I don't smoke them that often. My favorites are Upmann, 
Montecruz, Don Diego, and Macanudo (though Macanudo is kinda hot on the 
tongue). Moreover, what I wondered is what is the taste and aroma like.

Thanks.

&gt;From Towson, Maryland.

[ Well, under $30, you'll probably get a "Second." Connoisseur might
be a good bet in that range, because they don't attempt to hide
defects with putty.  As for tobacco, I'd recommend getting a few
samples (maybe a cavendish and an English); since you're a cigar
smoker already, you could probably try the English, though I wouldn't
usually recommend such for a beginning pipe smoker.  -S. ]

Steve -

Continued nice job with the Digest, and congrats on breaking the 2000
member barrier!

A note of interest to those in SE Michigan - The Malaga Briar Pipe Co.,,
in Royal Oak, is picking up their pipe production again after quite a long
lull.

For a long time, Malaga seemed intent on de-emphasizing pipes for an expansion
in cigars.  At one point, Steve, the founders' son, was busily making plans
for doubling the size of his walk-in humidor, and the beautiful handmade Malaga
pipes were in short supply.

No more.  The plans for the expanded humidor have been dropped, and the pipes
are back in force!  In addition to his own beautiful work (which I am quite
partial to) in traditional and freehands, Steve has also found a local 
craftsman who is doing AWESOME things in creating "figure-type" pipes for
Malaga.  One I drooled over, but could not afford - a fully detailed American
Eagle, holding an American Flag in its' claws.

Steve is also taking his work on the road, and says he will be attending the
Ann Arbor Art Fair, and will also be participating in the Renaisannce (?) 
festival this summer.  I'd recommend his work to anyone interested in superior
quality, handmade pipes.

For the record, I have no association with Malaga, except as a very satisfied
customer.

Last, a note under the heading "Why can't this happen to me once in a while?":

This past Saturday, I spent a few hours crusing the Antique and Collectibles
show at the the Gibralter Trade Center in Mt. Clemens.  Places like this are
great sources for old pipes, IF you're willing to sort through the chaff.  
(The chaff, in this case, included a vendor who had a basket of used Dr. 
Grabows, and was selling them for a "giveaway" prices of $7.50 each (grin).)

Anyway, one guy was selling off a collection for a widow, and had some really
nice Alborg's and Ben Wades.  While I was drooling over beautiful old Peterson
System Standard (which I bought for $38, thank-you-very-much), I struck up a 
conversation  with a pleasant older gentleman.  We were chatting about various
pipe-related things, when he mentioned that he'd received most of his pipes
as a group when his uncle passed away.  He went on to say that he didn't really
know anything about pipe brands, but looked mostly for nice grains and 
finishes.

"You seem to know something about brand names", he said.   "I've got one pipe
that I got from my uncle that seems really nice.  It looks kind of like this
one", he said, picking up a straight, no-name pipe from the table, "except it's
got a white dot on the top of the stem." (gasp).  "I think the name is Dunmore,
or Dunn Hill, or something?  Do you know anything about it?"

Weakly, I asked him how old it was.  "Well, I'd guess he probably bought it 
in the 50's or 60's.".  (gasp, gasp).  

I explained what I thought his pipe might be, encouraged him to treat
it nicely, and suggested he get it appraised, and maybe insured.  He
thanked me, and wandered away into the crowd.

Sigh.

Anyway, thanks again for the great work you do on the digest.

Dear Steve,
I've been a little busy lately, and just got around to reading 
PD#212. Congratulations on passing the 2000 subscriber mark! PD is 
surely one exception to the rule that popularity = mediocrity.

Brad Richards asked about clove tobaccos. I don't know any blends 
available, but in my youth back in the sixties I experimented with 
many additions to tobacco, including cloves. I tried putting whole 
cloves in with the base tobacco, and the result was a surprise. When 
the burning tobacco reached a clove,  it would explode. Not a KABOOM 
of course, but a definite pop and puff.  And it did not result in a 
clove flavored tobacco.

Jude Rennolds asked for help in avoiding charring the top of the bowl 
when lighting up. My solution to this problem has been to wet a 
finger and then moisten the top of the bowl prior to lighting the 
tobacco.  It works very well.

John Marindale's comments on the aroma of some of Cornell &amp; Diehl's 
tobaccos surprised me. While I have lately favored English blends, I 
still keep some #300 Apricots and Cream around as a "marriage saver." 
I recently had a stranger on a bycicle stop to ask me what I was 
smoking. He said he had been following the fantastic smell for two 
blocks! He actually thanked me for making his ride so enjoyable.  In 
Manhattan, a couple of months ago, someone shouted over his shoulder 
at me, "I hate smoking, but that smells great!"  Perhaps there was 
something wrong with the shipment he received? I've found Craig's 
tobaccos very consistent.

Best to you and yours,
Spencer Schein

Jude,

You might try a Nimrod pipe lighter. I'm not 100% sure if these
are still made, but you might be able to track one down
nonetheless.

The Nimrod pipe lighter is like a Zippo turned sideways and made
into a cylinder. Instead of a flip-open cover, it has a
slide-open cover. It's about 3 inches long and about 3/4 inches
in diameter and uses standard lighter fluid (Ronsonol) and
flints. At least the model I have is solidly made from aluminum

The key feature for you is that the aperture where the flame
comes out has a raised, octagonal, beveled edge.  I experimented
a bit and found that I could guide this raised, beveled
aperture directly over the bowl of the pipe with my eyes
closed. If the aperture is kept close to the bowl, flame is
guided directly to the tobacco.

If you are familiar with a Zippo, you should find the Nimrod
simple to use. To light it, push the slide open with your thumb
or index finger to expose the wick, then flick the lighting
wheel with your thumb. One difference between lighting a Nimrod
and a Zippo is that with the Nimrod you flick the lighting wheel
away from the lighter instead of pulling down or towards the
lighter as with a Zippo. (The motion is the same as flicking a
coin into the air with your thumb.)

Once lit, you puff on the pipe and the flame is drawn downward
through the aperture. To extinguish the flame, you push the
slide back over the wick.

Maintenance is easy. The flint tube is capped with a small,
brass screw-in plug, as with a Zippo, except that the plug is
accessible from the outside of the lighter. There is no need to
disassemble the lighter to change flint. The plug screws off
with a dime or a penny. To add fluid, you unscrew the large
ribbed cap on the base of the lighter. It's altogether an
ingenious design.

in a desk drawer for over a decade, since both my father 
and his partner had long before given up smoking pipes. 
I held onto it as a novelty for another decade until I took
up pipe smoking. It's now a valuable back-up to my IMCO
lighter.

d like to share with Pipes Digest readers an appreciation  of twist
tobacco. I have been smoking black twist, sometimes called "Irish twist," for
about thirty years. At one time, Gallaher's of Ireland used to produce and
export it in a one-pound tin containing sixteen individually wrapped pieces.
It eventually became too expensive for them to manufacture, and now it is
only possible to obtain through Bob Lynch, who gets it from Gawith, Hoggarth
in England. Bob stocks several different thicknesses of both black and brown
twist, but my choice is the XXX black unscented type.
Historically, twist is one of the oldest forms of tobacco still being made.
It began production when tobacco was first becoming popular in Europe:
sailors would twist the leaves together, wrap them tightly in canvas, and let
them steep in their own juices until the finished product was ready to smoke.

Twist is quite labor-intensive, and still involves a great deal of
manual-rather than machine-work. The tobacco leaves are spun, almost in the
same way that wool is spun, to form a long, continuous rope. Large pieces of
this rope are then wrapped in cloth and processed under pressure and heat
until they turn dark brown or-in the ultimate stage-a rich, oily black.
Twist can be either chewed or smoked. In the very poor areas of Ireland, it
was common for people to chew pieces of twist and then, eventually, to smoke
what they had chewed. Today, it is prepared for smoking by cutting the
thinnest possible pieces off the rope (it is usually sold in a half-pound or
one pound piece), rubbing it between the palms, as one does with flake
tobacco, and then filling the pipe bowl.
As there is a good deal of moisture in twist, it does smoke "wetter" than
other types of tobacco, and requires frequent relighting.
It should be said, too, that black twist is probably the strongest pipe
tobacco in the world. Unless one has a cast-iron constitution, it should only
be smoked after meals. However, for those with sensitive tongues-people like
myself, whose tongues are burned by almost every tobacco on the market-twist
is ideal, since it will never bite. 
It is difficult to describe the flavor of black twist, except to say that it
has rich, smoky qualities and is also reminiscent of strong espresso coffee.
For those who like single-malt Scotch, especially a peat-smoky one like
Laphroaig, twist is an experience that will give great pleasure. 
The only other tobacco I have ever smoked that was in any way as satisfying
as black twist was one called "Warlock" (Compton Mackenzie's favorite). This
went out of production twenty or twenty-five years ago, and if anyone still
has some tins of it lying around, I would be glad to hear from him.

I hope that some of the more adventurous readers of Pipes Digest will give
twist a try. Contact Bob Lynch if you would like to buy some.

One more note: If anyone out there enjoys nasal inhalant snuff (not the stuff
that goes between lip and gum), please communicate with me to compare notes
on types you use (my own favorite is Irish high toast).

Hello, Steve.  I just wanted to let you know of my appreciation for PD, 
and a little of my pipe smoking background.  I started college here at 
Christian Brothers University in Memphis just about a year ago.  I never 
imagined anything like college is...what a rush!  Well, anyway, with the 
daily grind and pressures of college life, I found myself to be exhausted 
and becoming often.  It wasn't until around my 1st semester exams that I 
considered smoking a pipe.  I have been a cigar smoker for approximately 
4 years, so naturally I didn't see pipes as something "for old men."  And 
of course, I wanted to try something new.  As exams neared, stress 
levels grew exponentially.  I usually surf the web when I can, and had 
noticed your pipe information page on a random hit.  I read your 
"Beginner's Guide..." and my curiosity was piqued.  I want out to a drug 
store and bought a Dr. Grabow Lark and some drug store cherry cavendish.
With a little practice, I got the hang of it and really began to look 
forward to smoking it.  I smoked my pipe while studying for exams, and 
God, let me tell you, I couldn't believe how RELAXING pipe smoking was!
my stress dissipated to minimal levels, and I Began to feel better, 
physically.  Well, that started a new pastime for me.  I went out to the 
Tinder Box and bought a sampler tin of some blends:  Crown Royale (my 
favorite), Norse Gold (a little Strong), Golden Treasure (good on 
occasion), Chairman's Mixture (my second favorite), North Sea (hadn't 
opened it yet), Peach Melba (a really good aromatic), and a few others.  
I could really tell the difference b/t drugstore and good tobacco.  I am 
looking forward to purchasing a decent pipe, of good briar, when I get my 
next paycheck.  But for now, my Lark suits me just fine.  You have 
recruited another pipe smoker, and I want to express my gratitude for 
introducing me to such a fine pleasure.  Thank you.

As a college student, the thing that marveled me was the fact that smokers
on my campus, be them pipe, cigar, or even cigarette smokers, lived as
small pockets.  Recently I undertook the founding of a group devoted to
smoking, socializing and education of the history of smoking.  I tried to
submit a proposal for club funding (we wanted to bring in local
tobaccanists for talks and fund trips to different cities to buy a variety
of tobaccos.  The SGA Treasurer wasn't helpful, and I didn't find out until
three minutes before it was due, that we needed a formal constitution along
with the proposal.  After sending in our forms, I was informed a week later
that the SGA had blocked our proposal (no big suprise.)  I spent two weeks
working to get the constitution together and worked with several people to
perfect it.  This time I sat in on the SGA meeting.  At the appropriate
time, I was asked to speak my piece and presented it as a stand-alone
document, dropping the funding part and aiming for club recognition.  The
SGA voted us down again and we left.  A friend of mine wrote a letter to
the editor of our school newspaper complaining about being denied without a
good reason and that the SGA should be encouraging student socialization.
The SGA took a second vote recently and decided to give us the recognition
we deserve.  Next semester, we will bid for club funding, but we are
satisfied knowing that we are probably the only school around with an
SGA-recognized smoking group.

you'll be getting orders and requests from the Briar Society of Washington

Dear Steve,

Thank you for my subscription to Pipes Digest.

I am a 35 year-old pipesmoker from the UK and have been smoking a pipe
for just under three years now. My favourite tobaccos are Condor Mild
and St Bruno. I somehow regret having not started when I was a lot
younger, although I have never touched a cigarette in my life, it is
still hard for family and friends to accept me taking up this peaceful
pastime at my age!  Yet in a country where (cigarette) smoking is
still common and much more acceptable than say in the US, to be seen
smoking a pipe in public at my age in life often seems to attract
funny looks and the occasional odd comment!

Reading through back issues of PD, it is certainally very encouraging
that people much younger than myself, generally in the US, are keeping
the pastime alive. Here in the UK pipesmoking, these days, seems to be
regarded as something for the older generation, something perhaps to
turn to after years of cigarette smoking rather than take it up at a
younger age as a beginner smoker as something to appreciate and enjoy,
rather than simply just dismiss it. Since I began, I have still yet to
meet and get talking with a fellow pipesmoker who is younger me! Sadly
quite a high proportion of the British younger generation still take
up cigarette smoking and inevitably end up getting hooked. At least I
can safely say that my very moderate use of tobacco has not lead
towards any addiction or degradation to my health. Whilst the
anti-smoking lobby will instantly put the blame on advertising, the
cigarette manufactures will turn around and reply that advertising is
intended only to encourage smokers to change brands. Meanwhile,
despite a huge potential market out there, the UK pipe industry seem
to do little to promote the benefits of pipesmoking - much less
harmful than cigarettes, a wide range of tobbacos available but most
important the sheer pleasure and relaxtion gained, not to mention the
cost saving!

Although the US is streets ahead than here in the UK with regards to
the internet, if there are PD readers from the UK/Ireland in their
early 30s or younger, please write in or feel free to contact me, I
would hate to feel left out!

Best wishes,

Things I have to submit:

--Discrimination in tobacco shops?
--Will a "good" pipe stop the gurgle?
--How the cake effects flavor...?

**DISCRIMINATION**
I just thought I'd drop my two cents in and hopefully save some people from
a bit of grief that they may be putting _themselves_ through over this issue
of discrimination in tobacco shops.

First, I in no way would defend or condone a shopkeep if he (or she--can't
discriminate :) were to discriminate against a woman who came to do business
there.  That is completely unacceptable.

However, I would pose the question:  If you were to work in a tobacco shop,
and every day you see that by a margin of 9 to 1, it is men who make
purchases there, and fairly rarely, if ever, do you ever see a woman buying,
wouldn't it be a fairly understandable conclusion on the part of the
shopkeep that it was the man who was interested in buying, and the woman was
just tagging along?  I know that if it were me, it would quickly become
natural to save time and effort for everyone to make a tiny little
assumption.  If I'm wrong, it's easy enough to make a little apology and get
back to business.  I've often been with a woman in what I call a "foofy"
store, and the clerk will rarely look at me when they approach to say, "Can
I help you find anything?"  It's always the woman they look at, and her
assumption is understandable.

Now, if after straightening out the issue of who is the interested party,
and you find the shopkeep still ignoring you, inferring that you somehow
have no right to be in the store, I would say that this person is being a
bit rude.  I would call back to the store when I got home (and many times,
have) and I track down the manager to relay my experience.  I'm sure that
they would want to be aware of it.  It's not good business to let an
employee treat people that way.  But let's not embark on a witchhunt,
looking for everyone to have prejudice in their heart, simply because they
may have made an honest assumption-- one that proves true for them 90 out of
100 times in the rest of their business day.  It seems that the media has
gotten everyone hypersensitive to the point where there is a racist, a bigot
or a womanizer around every corner.  It's generally not the case.

Stress is something that we put on ourselves.  There are much bigger
problems in the world to get stressed over.  Go home, put it behind you, put
yourself in a good mood and sit down to enjoy one of the great pleasures in
life-- a good pipe.  :)

And to Steve-- Once again, I have to say that you do a great job, and this
most recent tar-baby that you nearly got stuck to (Ye Old Pipe) is a good
example of the kinds of things that will earn you sainthood for enduring for
the good of us, the PD readers.

**GURGLING**

I received a great email response from Joel Farr, of Pipe Friendly fame and
thought that others might appreciate the insight he offered.  I hope that he
doesn't mind it being placed into a public forum.  For those who came in
late, this refers to a question posed in PD #212:

(Below, my original comments that he quoted back are "&gt;&gt;" and his are "&gt;".
My latest comments are unquoted.)

&gt;Jeff,
&gt;
&gt;  What Al said is essentially correct IMHO.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I would like to think that what Al says is true, because I have a devil of a
&gt;&gt;time with this problem.  I would like to find some way to enjoy my smoking
&gt;&gt;without having to deal with the melodious twitter that emanates from the
&gt;&gt;small frog pond that forms in the bowl whenever I smoke tobacco that isn't
&gt;&gt;cracklingly dry.  If that means buying a particular kind of pipe (expensive
&gt;&gt;or not), I'll do it--
&gt;
&gt;  The optimum condition for tobacco is 'springy.'  Some blends are drier and
&gt;others wetter, but this is the norm.  The other solution (aside from a new
&gt;pipe purchase) is to run a pipe cleaner into the bowl when the twitter of
&gt;fluids is heard.

OK-- So it sounds like what you're saying is that a good pipe WILL help (or
dare I say, solve) the moisture issue.

&gt;&gt;Until now, the only advice that I've been able to find useful was that of
&gt;&gt;Paul Spaniola in Flint, Michigan.  He and he son, Dan have been smoking pipes
&gt;&gt;for over a hundred years between them (no kidding).  They claim that a pipe
&gt;&gt;does not need to be "rested", as is commonly advised.  They say that you can
&gt;&gt;smoke the same pipe all day long if you like, but you do need to let it cool
&gt;&gt;before you reload it.  Dan says that he keeps two pipes around during the day
&gt;&gt;in the shop there, and he switches back and forth.  This is as close to
&gt;&gt;"rotating" his pipes as he comes.  They say that the "pipe rotating" myth
&gt;&gt;comes from pipe salesmen. 
&gt;
&gt;  If it is a myth, I subscribe to it.  In my case, however, I love pipes and
&gt;the variety that's out there.  I'd be extremely unhappy if I could only smoke
&gt;2 pipes over and over again.  

Agreed-- I think the point he was making was that there is no /harm/ in
smoking a pipe without resting it.  I'm getting the impression, though, that
the resting simply allows the pipe to dry out, true?

Also, I'm getting the feeling that the Spaniola comments had were saying,
basically, that keeping a pipecleaner handy and using it when necessary is
all it takes to take up the slack between a "good" pipe, and a cheaper,
albeit wetter smoking, pipe.

&gt;&gt;But they are both real proponents of keeping pipe cleaners handy and
&gt;&gt;swabbing the stem down to the bowl a couple/three times while smoking.  I
&gt;&gt;don't know...maybe they make more money on pipecleaners than they do on a
&gt;&gt;good pipe ;)
&gt;
&gt;  Again, I'm not sure if the frequency isn't excessive, but the thought is
&gt;definatly on the mark.

Oops... I was a bit misleading there.  When he suggested his advice on using
a pipecleaner while smoking, he said that it might be necessary to swab it
more than once, but as you alluded to, he did say that three times in the
course of a bowlful would be the most you'd have to do to keep it dry.  He
seemed to do it about once in the course of a bowl, if that.  Also, swabbing
while the pipe is still warm allows all the stickies to remain liquid and
easy to clean out rather than waiting for a cold pipe, which makes it much
harder to clean.

In any case, I think that what the Spaniolas were attesting to is the fact
that a person needn't spend a great deal of money to enjoy a good smoke.
Pipecleaners will fill in the gaps.  If this is the case, I wish they'd have
also mentioned that the annoying requirement to swab could be avoided by
getting an absorbent (more expensive) pipe.  Their comments about there
being "no difference between a $5 pipe and a $500 pipe" were really directed
at the taste.  They said that any other differences in cost could be
attributed to aesthetics.

**CAKE FLAVOR**
Also, about taste, they said that a large part of taste comes from the cake
that is built up in the bowl.  If you switch tobaccos, it will take at least
4 ounces to fully acclimate (I don't remember the words they used) the pipe
to the new tobacco.  This, Dan says, is why they will sometimes get people
who come in and switch to a new tobacco, then several weeks later come in
and say that it now tastes better (or worse) than when they started.  It's
because originally, the tobacco was imparting a flavor to the cake that also
included their OLD tobacco.  It takes a while to fully reflavor (or build
originally) the cake.  BTW, they also say that it takes about eight months
of daily smoking to build up a good cake.

&gt;&gt;Anyway, the Spaniolas were extremely helpful, good people.  I highly
&gt;&gt;recommend anyone in Flint, Michigan to brave the city streets down to their
&gt;&gt;shop.  It's truly a unique experience that you won't find just anywhere.  Be
&gt;&gt;very nice, and you'll get a personal tour of the pipe museum--a tour that is
&gt;&gt;different for everyone that gets to see it because what you see depends on
&gt;&gt;what Paul decides to pick up and talk about.  Nearly every pipe in there has
&gt;&gt;a great story behind it.
&gt;
&gt;  One of these days I'll get to the Big D, but until then I'll have to settle
&gt;on the mails.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;But back to the gurgling issue-- What Al said does sound like a plausible
&gt;&gt;explanation, and in fact would answer my old, ever present question, "What is
&gt;&gt;really going on when a pipe is 'resting' ?"  Maybe a pipe needs to "rest"
&gt;&gt;because it simply takes time to dry out--and good briar really does have a
&gt;&gt;good absorbent quality and ability to soak up and dry up an infinite number
&gt;&gt;of times.
&gt;
&gt;  This point is correct.  Add to it the fact that less expensive pipes often
&gt;use heavy varnishes and laquers to help hide fills and flaws.  These
&gt;processes can cripple the pipes long term ability to rejuvinate. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Al, where did you get your information on that?  Or does anyone else have
&gt;&gt;any other comments on the subject?  As I said, I'd like to beleive that the
&gt;&gt;answer to my problem is simply to get a good quality pipe, and I'll always
&gt;&gt;have a great smoke.  Until then, I'm finding that I simply have to let my
&gt;&gt;tobacco dry out quite a bit.  It's a fine line, though, between dried out
&gt;&gt;just enough for proper tamping, and tamping it only to find tobacco dust left
&gt;&gt;waiting to be lit.  &lt;Sigh&gt; 
&gt;
&gt;  Al's been doin' pipe stuff for longer than most PD readers have been alive
&gt;(or at least adults).  I can't begin to speak of his specific experiences,
&gt;but most carvers say the same things.  For a formal discussion, I recommend
&gt;you get a copy of Rick Hacker's Ultimate Pipe Book.

This is reassuring.  Again, I want to say that I don't intend to question
Al's expertise.  I'm just really anxious to get the real dope on this
"resting" and moisture issue.  Most people I talk to who have smoked pipes
for a long time haven't done much pondering on it.  They just smoke their
pipes and enjoy.  The typical response I get when asking a question is
something along the lines of, "Hmmm...", as they puff thoughtfully, "That's
a good question.  I don't know why that is..."  :/

Thank goodness for the PD to get these issues hammered out :)

&gt;  Hope this helps.
&gt;
&gt;Until later ... Smoke Well!

From: Craig Tarler &lt;???@???.???&gt;
<a name="22">Subject: Breakthrough</a>

Hi, Steve,

I want to announce what we think is a marvelous breakthrough in pipe tobacco.
We are offering for the first time a very small amount of what I'll call
"Sam's Blend," a nicotine-free tobacco that smokes, I think, better than
anything I've ever blended before.

The story of Sam's Blend started about five years ago with a discovery.  My
great uncle, Schmuel ("Sam") Tarler, was an herbalist in Odessa and also a
lifelong a pipe smoker. In the 1890's his two brothers (one of them my
grandfather) and a sister immigrated first to Austria and then to the US.  In
going through my grandfather's effects we found a small packet of something
that looked like tobacco with a blend formula and a note to my grandfather
from Great Uncle Sam asking him to see if this tobacco could be reproduced in
the US.

The fascinating thing about this blend was that it contained no tobacco, and
thus no nicotine! It was a mixture of other plants, with the most crucial
ingredient, as far as we could determine, the leaves of a plant called, in a
literal translation from the Russian, "Flower of the Steppes".

There was just enough for a couple of pipesful, although it was very, very
dry. I wet it with a little distilled water and applied some heat and it came
back so that I could try it. WOW! This tasted better than any blend I'd ever
had, something a little like "English", but with a woodsy, nutty, taste I've
never had before.  It was wonderful!

And it smelled great even to nonsmokers.  A couple of women from my wife's
bridge club were in the house while I was experimenting, and thought it
smelled kind of like a wood fire with a little cinnamon.  One of the
poodles-and-potpourri set even asked me for a sample to take home and use for
the aroma.  Of course, I couldn't give any of it out at the time, and it would
have been wasted on her poodles anyway.

But, how to reproduce it?  Without the "Flower of the Steppes," every mixture
I made up was lifeless and flat, not worth the trouble to smoke it.  I tried
the Botany Department at UNC, but none of them had any idea what "Flower of
the Steppes" was.  They agreed to analyze the last little bit of Sam's Blend,
to try to find a similar plant.  We tried dozens of plants, but every attempt
failed.

Then a friend of mine who's a microbiologist, and I'm not going to identify
him except that he's not at UNC, suggested we try to extract the DNA and clone
the main ingredient.  Over a period of several years, we have been
experimenting with the resulting plants and Sam's formula.

We've come very close.  But we're having a hard time growing the plants
because it takes some impressive equipment to keep them alive (low pressure
chambers to simulate high altitude, sterile condititions because there are a
lot of plant diseases that clones can't stand, and some rare and expensive
trace minerals in the soil.)  And they grow very slowly.

Because of the hoorah about nicotine, and the fact that we weren't certain the
"Flower of the Steppes" wasn't addictive, we had to experiment.  I smoked just
Sam's Blend for two months.  I found that I could smoke ten or fifteen bowls a
day, more than three times my usual, with no tongue bite and no other
problems. And I loved every bowl.

Then I quit cold turkey for a month.  No problem, I didn't crave it, I just
missed it.  It wasn't addictive at all!

Now we have about two pounds of this marvelous blend and are ready to offer it
exclusively to any P.D. readers who would be willing to pay $25 per ounce, one
ounce per customer. The only drawback that we observed was that, if you smoke
two or three bowls fast, Sam's Blend tends to cause temporary priapism, which
has diverted my attention from pipe smoking sometimes.  However, it hasn't
really been a bother at all.

If any of the readers want to try Sam's Blend, please E-mail me at
???@???.???.

[ Craig, this I've got to try.  Please reserve an ounce for me -- if
there's any left! -S. ]

<a name="23">Subject: Honest Long Cut Tobacco - Anyone Remember It ?</a>

Hi Steve,

    Actually I am posing this question to anyone who might recognize 
this old, old tobacco blend for a friend of mine.  It was a "drug 
store" type blend from the early 1900's through about the 1950's or 
1960's and then disappeared.  It was an American product.  My friend 
remembers his grandfather smoking Honest Longcut back in the late 
1940's and early 1950's.  He mentioned this to me after I told him I 
was to attend the NY Pipe Show on March 2, 1996, and asked me to look 
out for any nostalgia buffs who might have some.  To my surprise, a 
fellow by the name of Jay, from Hermit Tobacco, Fronteir, MI. had two 
old packages.  My friend has since purchased the two from Jay.  He 
plans to spring them on his brother who also has fond memories of 
grandad and his pipe.  He would indeed be interested in finding out 
what became of this family favorite.  If anyone has any info would they 
please kindly post it ?  He, and I would appreciate it.  

Thanks Steve, and I'll write sometime soon as to my beginnings in pipe 
smoking.  

Your friend,

Louis F. Carbone

Hello Steve,

  Just wanted to tell you what a great job you are doing with PD. I am a
relatively new pipe smoker (8 months) and have picked up alot of helpful
hints here. I look forward to receiving it every couple weeks. I just
recently bought my first "better" pipe. I have never seen it mentioned by
any of the other members and wanted to get they're opinions. It is a Sasieni
- Four Dot pipe. It is bent and has a rough finish to it. The tobacconist at
a local shop helped me pick it out. It smokes alot better than any of the
cheap pipes I have. Just wanted some opinions about it. Keep up the good
work. I can't wait to get the next issue.

I'm a new subscriber and so far, I love it!

When I was a little girl, my father used to smoke cigars and pipes which had
such a heavenly aroma, I would constantly badger him to let me try a puff or
two.  After a while, he came up with the inspired idea that if I tried his
cigar, I'd hate it and never want to take up smoking.  Needless to say, he
was wrong (he should have given me something of less quality than what he
smoked -- *that* might have done the trick).  Now I smoke cigarettes and have
recently taken up cigars (as did my fiance).  What I'd like to know now is:
are there any "ladies nights" at cigar club or restaurants that allow cigar
smoking in New York City?  Also, where on the cigar is the proper place to
snip the end (my father, who no longer smokes and is now delighted that I've
taken up cigars, has made me a gift of his guillotine cutter)?  Finally, are
there any pipes that are considered "acceptable" for women (this vice has not
yet seemed to reached my gender or generation)?  Thanks a lot for your input.

LIT UP AND LAID BACK

Lit up and laid back
Tobacco shop is a smokers' haven.

By Scott Huler
staff writer
Raleigh, North Carolina

The thing to keep in mind as you walk into Tobacconists of Raleigh is this
place is not about smoking.

Yes, the little store on Capital Boulevard is a tobacco shop - one, its
customers will tell you, with the widest variety of cigars and pipe tobaccos in
the Triangle. And yes, it has a special ventilation system that allows - no,
encourages - its patrons to sit down and smoke a while.

But what keeps people coming back isn't the selection. Or even the pictures
and figures of smoking sea captains, cowboys and, of course, Indians. No, the
reason you see the same faces here day after day has something to do with the
eight wine-colored leather wing chairs, arranged in a pleasant rectangle around
an Oriental rug, each with an end table and capacious ashtray close. Something
to do with the many stools within grabbing distance, should the crowd get too
big, as it often does around lunchtime. Something to do with the way someone
shouts "Window!" - stopping all conversation - whenever a pretty woman walks
into the manicurist next door.

As noted, this place is not just about smoking: It's about hanging around.

Mark Moctezuma, a bearded printed circuit designer from North Raleigh, taps
an ash off his long, slim cigar and explains.

"This is the last vestige of the men's club," he says. "The barbershop, the
old corner grocery store."

His companions, three men and a woman, nod their heads sagaciously and tip
their own ashes.

"It's like Floyd the barber's shop in Mayberry," says Tom Marrelli, a
47-year-old consultant who comes in every day. "We actually sit here and solve
all the problems of the world. We just don't tell anybody."

"I look at this," says Steve Robinson, 47, a commercial real estate broker
from Cary who sucks on a pipe, "as my one-hour vacation in a day."

Vigorous assent from the rest of the crowd. "I come here so I don't have to
answer the phone at my studio," says Keith Roy Thomas, 35, an oil portrait
painter in North Raleigh.

Tobacconists of Raleigh, then, is a retreat. "Think about 'Cheers,' " says
Gary Blandina, a 35-year-old teacher from Durham. "A place where everybody
knows your name."

And they do. As the smokers sat around on a recent afternoon, they
recognized certain cars. "Here comes Keith," they said before he emerged from
his car. Or, "Hey, it's Joey Spicc," of Joe Spicchali, who comes in daily.

And there's always a crowd. Debbie Churchill, who manages the shop, says the
store, started by her father after he retired from IBM, has formed a community.
They come in, of course, to smoke. But tobacco takes up very little of their
conversation. Sure, they can wax rhapsodic on a specific cigar, but they don't
need to talk about smoking: They're already doing that. Sure, they can lightly
gripe about the anti-tobacco forces, but none of them claims tobacco isn't
unhealthy. And they have some interest in the nationwide increase in cigar
smoking, especially among women and younger people. Moctezuma calls cigarettes
"short attention-span smoking," and they agree that what makes cigars special
is the time they take. "You have to understand, it's a 45-minute smoke,"
Marrelli says. Heads nod.

So they talk. They talk politics, they talk money, they just talk. When one
is sick, the others go to the hospital. When one needs to move, the others lend
trucks - and backs - to make it happen. They have helped each other find jobs;
they share investment advice. One regular patron often brings or sends buckets
of chicken from his restaurant franchises.

Sometimes they stray from simple running commentary. When Moctezuma,
explaining why he smokes cigars, launches into the tale of his grandfather, a
cigar roller from Veracruz, Mexico, mouths drop. His grandfather was in San
Francisco during the 1906 earthquake, Moctezuma says. And he was blackballed
from Florida cigar factories for refusing to support the Communists in the
Spanish Civil War. "He rolled his own cigars and sold them for shoes for the
kids," Moctezuma says, punctuating with a long puff.

"Hey!" Marrelli says. "Mark's got a real story!"

Which just spurs another round of storytelling. "See?" Marrelli says. "I'm
telling you, everyone I bring in from out of town, they all say, it's Floyd the
barber's store from Mayberry."

They describe each other as family, spurring yet another round of joking.
"Family?" asks Moctezuma, turning to Spicchali. "Dad, can I have the keys to
the car?"

Spicchali tosses a set of keys. "Just fill it up when you bring it back."

He's only half joking; throughout the day, they run errands for each other,
pick up lunches, help each other out. It's like a college dorm lounge, where
the coffee's always on and one set of drinkers is just finishing up when the
next arrives. The participants come and go, but the easy conversation never
stops.

Says Churchill, "I can tell what time of day it is by who's in here." And so
can others. Thomas may say he's getting away from his phone, but other smokers
can't hide here - in two hours on Friday, four of 10 who drifted into and out
of the store received phone calls there. But still, they can always duck a
call; their friends will cover for them.

Marrelli, growing thoughtful, sums up: "In a relatively busy world, when you
want to have social intercourse, you have coffee, or you invite people for
food. Who has time to do it?

"Here, what you have is the opportunity to have a tea party every day."

But it's too late for Marrelli to grow too poetic - Blandina is snorting in
his best "Beavis and Butt-head" imitation.

"Huh-huh! Huh-huh!" he wheezes. "You said intercourse."

And that's how it stays - from 10 till 6 every day. Painters, salesmen,
philosophers, gathered around the ashtray, their own '90s version of the
cracker-barrel talk or pot-bellied stove. Solving the problems of the world,
making jokes about each other's comments, and looking at the women as they go
to the nail shop.

Robinson says the store represents the future of retail. He points to his
monogrammed shirt cuffs, describing how the catalog he orders from keeps his
name, his size and other preferences on file. They know who he is when he
calls, he says, and it makes a difference.

Tobacconists of Raleigh is much the same. "This is a free service to the
clients," he says. "A place for smokers to congregate."

Debbie Churchill agrees, to an extent. That is, maybe it's the future of
retail - but maybe it's the past as well. Or maybe it's just what a good store
has always been, whether it's that old grocery store with the cracker barrel or
Floyd's. It's a place to be together.

"We are a family owned business," Churchill says, switching from a cigar to
a cigarette. "But the men who sit out there? They're like our extended family."

So it is, but it really is only an hour of a day. Joe Spicchali stands up.
"Well, guys," he says, "A slice of heaven, but I gotta go."

He'll be back. 

[ Debbie, it sounds like what every smokeshop ought to be. Thanks! -S. ]

<a name="27">Subject: [PIPES]</a>

Hello, Steve,

  It was a year ago this month that I obtained access to the Internet and
stumbled onto the Pipes Web Page.  Since that time I have been an avid
reader and an all-too-frequent contributor.  In reflection, I must say that
the Digest has changed my pipe smoking life--all for the better.

  First, of course, is the sense of camaraderie that the Digest generates.
Every couple of weeks (more or less), pipe smokers from around the world
receive the latest issue and share their knowledge and experiences; ask and
answer questions; gently debate the burning (pun intended) smoking-related
issues of the day; and pretty much feel at ease with each other.  Is it any
wonder the list of subscribers keeps growing by leaps and bounds.

  Second is the fact that the Digest is an invaluable way to discover the
people and places of the pipe and cigar smoking world.  Through the Digest
I learned of the local pipe club and the expos it puts on annually; of
smoke shops--both locally and away from home; of mail-order sources of
smoking materials; and of publications that one might otherwise never come
across ("Pipe Friendly" and "The Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris" come to mind).

  And third, the Digest has certainly helped me expand my horizons
regarding the pipes and tobaccos I smoke.  For many years I was content to
purchase low- to mid-range pipes and one basic aromatic tobacco blend.  And
don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with either of these--I have more
than one inexpensive pipe in my collection that are made out of some pretty
ugly wood, but they're comfortable and always provide me with a good smoke;
and I still smoke that aromatic blend from time to time.  But I've branched
out, thanks to the Digest.  I now look for better quality pipes (and not
just the expensive ones--I've picked up some pretty nice pieces for under
$100); I smoke a wide variety of tobacco blends, have discovered the joys
of English and other non-aromatic blends, and am constantly trying out new
ones (one recent one that I've found to be VERY good is Equinox offered by
Bob Hamlin's PCCA; I've also been sampling a variety of the Cornell and
Diehl blends, many of which are also very good).

  I doubt that I'm alone in any of this.  In fact, as of last issue, there
are over 2,000 of us.  All of this is by way of saying, simply, thanks,
Steve, for putting out the Pipes Digest.  I, for one, greatly appreciate
your efforts, and there are over 2,000 others who probably would agree.

--Ed

[ And there will doubtless be many more of us in the future, Ed; it's
a privilege to be able to do it for you and the community.  Thanks! -S. ]

<a name="28">Subject: Receipt of My First Issue</a>

Dear Steve:

Thanks for including me in your distribution. When I last (and first)
corresponded, I was en route from my home in Oklahoma City to San Francisco
and Yosemite for a week with my wife. I've spent alot of time thinking about
pipes, why I enjoy them and the reason that I bought my first one.

I attended Menlo College in Menlo Park, California from 1977 to 1980, and
fell for a terrific gal by the name of Pam Litwer. She decided on a new
haircut, and I offered my two cents worth. Seeing the aftermath at lunch that
day, I realized that my advice had been a mistake. She was as beautiful as
ever, but her hair would need months to repair. As we walked through the
Stanford Shopping Center on our way to the car, and in front of a Tinder Box,
I asked her what changes she would like to see in me. She said that she was
always attracted to men who smoked a pipe. A few minutes later, I was the
owner of a Peterson system and an ounce or two of California Blend. I've
enjoyed my few pipes since then (although I haven't seen that Peterson in
quite awhile), and I think of Pam whenever I smoke. As my wife and I walked
through the Stanford Center two days ago, I shared with her the story of my
first pipe. 

After a couple of days in San Francisco, we arrived at Yosemite last night,
and I am looking forward to a long weekend of beautiful mountain weather. Our
host maintains a no-smoking policy in the cabin, but I'll go for a walk, pipe
in hand, later this morning and until our departure Sunday.

I suppose that most of us were brought to our pipes under similarly enjoyable
circumstances, and our memories are just as fond. As I look forward to
reading future issues, I hope to find stories of first pipes and smokes that
bring a smile to the author as this one has to me. 

Thanks for your publication, for an outlet for my indulgence, and for the
promise of meeting others who share in this simple enjoyment.

Regards,

Tom Kilpatrick

[ Thank you for a wonderful story, Tom! -S. ]

Steve:

Just a note to let you know that the Chicagoland Pipe Collectors Club will be 
hosting a pipe show at the Clarion/Quality Inn O'Hare Hotel (5 minutes from 
the Chicago O'Hare Airport) on Saturday and Sunday April 13 &amp; 14.  There will 
be about 90 tables (tables are sold out) 60 + of which will be devoted to 
estate briar pipes and the balance of the tables devoted to antique pipes, 
tobacciana tins, cigar bands, and tobacciana literature.
All the major estate pipe dealers will be there as well as several 
internationally recognized collectors and experts in the antique pipe area.
Of special note, for the first time in its history Dunhill will have a 
major display of pipes from its London museum with the museum curator in 
attendance.  Also of note the Chicago Pipe Show is being held in conjunction 
with the Annual Pocket Lighter Preservation Guild Show (lighter collectors) 
which will be at the same hotel in a different ball room on Friday &amp; 
Saturday, April 12 &amp; 14.  The lighter show will be at least as large as the 
pipe show and traditionally attracts several collectors and dealers from 
Europe.  In other words we should have most important areas of tobacciana
collectables under one roof for the first time in memory.  There's a special 
hotel rate as long as you mention the show (I think its around $60).
                                                   John Loring  

[ Good luck on the show, John! -S. ]

In your resource guide I noticed that you had listed Fred Stoker and 
Sons , Dresden TN. however the correct zip code is 38225. Also I 
would like to take this opprotunity to thank
you for putting together such a wonderful, informative digest
and I am proud to be a part of your membership.

Question #1: Could you possibly send back issues of the digest #1 - # 
209, I am a new member and am very interested in reading these back 
issues. I have tried to read them on line but always manage to not be 
able to access them.

Question # 2: I recently purchased 2 Aldo Velani briars from
Italy and was wondering if you or any other digest members
have any opinions on these pipes, compared to GBD, Charatans and 
Dunhills etc.

I am relatively new to pipe smoking so my experience is nil, 
I notice that alot of the digest members give a background of 
themselves do here goes. I have smoked cigarettes for 10 yrs 
and recently gave them up for the finer pleasures of pipe smoking and 
have enjoyed every minute of it. I live in TN, have 2 children and a 
wonderful wife who readily accepts my new found joy and even 
purchased a new pipe and stand for our anniversary this past weekend. 
I love the cavendish blends of tobac and am eager to try some other 
blends in the
near future. 

Once again, thanks so much for the time you devote to making this 
digest what it is.

Pleasant Smoking,

Donovan Ransom

[ Back issues sent, and thanks for the correction! -S. ]

Dear Steve, dear friends-in-smoke:

For I just bought me a new Peterson (Sherlock Holmes Rathbone) there I
would like to make a contribution to the PD Resource Guide:

Tabak Trennt
Moellingstrasse 28
D-24103 Kiel
Germany
Telephone 0431/95890, Telefax 0431/95893.

It is a comfortable and luxury retail shop which sells pipes, cigars and
accessoires. If you had no reason so far to visit Northern Germany -- here
you are. The well-informed and helpful owner of the shop, Mr. Trennt (it's
an old family business), repairs pipes as well. --

Afar from this I bought some days ago my first estate pipe (I long had
prejudices about smoking pre-smoked pipes), cleaned it carefully and am now
the satisfied owner of a Nording #1 Silver Band. To all beginners in
pipe-smoking (with a small budget) I can really recommend this kind of
purchasing your "new" one.

Thanks for your work, Steve (and thanks to you all not minding my mistakes)!

Regards,
Hanjo.

	Hello various smokers one and all...
My name is Thomas Doucet. After reading posts in this excellent digest 
about people walking into little antique stores and finding racks of 
Dunhills, Pre-trans Barlings, and solid gold Petersons :) for three bucks 
a bushel, I did some second hand shopping old style myself. I think I may 
have come across ` my deal of the century '. Two hand-made Bellezia's
for $60.00 CDN.( that's three zero bucks each! ). I have never heard of 
such a talent but know brilliance when it pulls me to it.
I would appreciate it if anyone could send me info on this amazing pipe 
maker. I know he is from Buffalo ( from doing the word search thing )
and that's it. These baby's are smooooth....I think my old bryre Comoy
is a bit jealous.
My advice to anyone is go to the antique and flea market things.
Also, how do I get rid of the pesky SOFT carbon at the BOTTOM of the bowl.
I have tried the boiled alcool trick but this stuff is thick.
Well, time to get to know Mr. Bellezia a little better and reassure Mr. 
Comoy. 

P.S. ANDREW, thanks for the direction...

Steve,
 
On this occasion of the mailing of the first OPC newsletter (all 18 pages)
of 1996, I'd like to bring you and Digest subscribers up to date on the
Ohio Pipe Collectors and our upcoming show. The OPC now stands at 113
members from many states, Canada and Europe.  The newsletter is out,
featuring a long and interesting piece by OPC member Bob Everett from
Anacortes WA on his success at becoming an amateur maker of high-quality
pipes.  As always, we welcome anyone who would like to become a member,
thereby receiving the newsletter and supporting our annual September
swap/sell pipe show.  Dues are only $12 a year, prorated by the month for
new members.  Anyone who would like a free complimentary copy should send
me their mailing address.
 
The show, scheduled for Sept. 14, is shaping up very well.  Of the
available 65 tables, 18 are now rented.  I have just heard from noted
Chicago collector Rex Poggenpohl, who took two tables, and Mel Feldman of
The Smoker in Albany NY, who took five tables and promises to be coming
with a van full of people and 2,000 pipes.  Merchandise and promises of
great merchandise for our show raffle are pouring in.  The raffle proceeds
are what keep us afloat year to year as all other income pretty much gets
spent on the newsletter and show expenses.
 
Join us a member and/or come to the show.  We'd love to have you all.  If
anyone would like a show signup sheet, please let me
know.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.
Bill Unger
Secretary, Ohio Pipe Collectors

[ Bill, I wanted to also compliment you on the fantastic job you're
doing with the OPC.  It just gets better and better, and your energy
and enthusiasm show!  And is it my imagination, or has the show scene
become much more active in recent years? -S. ]

Steve,

        I am very embarrassed, but have to tell you that before I read your
"Pipe Digest" administrative guidelines, I jumped on the new subscribers
list and send emails to all new subscribers asking if they were interested
in receiving the FINE OLDE BRIARS catalog.  This email went out yesterday.
I would not have used this list for commercial purposes had I read your
guidelines first.  I'm sorry that I did not.

        I have received about 25 positive replies, including snail mail
addresses.  I hope you are not beseiged by angry subscribers complaining
about your giving out their email addresses.  I would be glad to get in
touch with anyone who is upset and explain that the error was mine
entirely.

        Please accept my assurances that this will not happen again, and
let me know if there is some way I can made amends.

        Rob Denholtz

[ Apology accepted, Rob, and no harm done, as far as I know.  -S. ]

Steve:

Just to thank you for all the fun we had with the April 1 PD. I got a lot 
of replies, some of them very funny. One reader suggested that the after 
effects of Sam's Blend must have given me "a handful"! Only one reader 
bit and he got an APRIL FOOL reply. I guess I lost a prospect, but it was 
fun.

On another subject: I think we have cloned Three Nuns. We're calling 
it Three Friars, #972. To make certain, I'm offering 2 oz. FREE to the 
first 10 Three Nuns smokers who contact me so that we can be sure or to 
make whatever changes are necessary.

Also, people have been asking me for a strawberry aromatic. We now have a 
super one, Strawberries &amp; Cream, #303. I never made one before. I thought 
the strawberry would kind of fade out because it is a delicate flavor. 
This one is strawberry to the bottom of the bowl!

Thanks again for all the fun.

<a name="3">Subject: Dented Briar Blues...</a>

Hello everyone,

I have a question for those who subscribe to this digest that are
handy in the area of pipe repairs.  I aquired a beautiful "Wiley"
free-hand briar back in January and somewhere along the way of
enjoying this great pipe I had a little accident with it resulting in
three or four small dings on the bowl.  

Feeling terrible about this, I went and talked to the man who i
bought it from, who is somewhat handy in pipe repairs, and asked him
if their was anything he could do to fix these dents short of putting
a filler in them or some other operation like that.  He told me that
he could use an old woodworking technique and, in his words, pull the
dents out of the briar without having to put a filler in or sand the
dents out.  

This made me very curious as to what this technique was all about,
being that I've done quite a bit of woodwork but had never heard of
this technique.  My question is, to those who might have knowledge of
this technique or any other technique for fixing dings in pipes, what
can be done to fix dings in a briar bowl.  I do realize that those
who make a profession in this sort of work probably don't want to
give away any trade secrets, but any hints that anyone could give me
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

[ Oddly enough, I may be able to shed some light on this one.  In
"Tage Frid Teaches Woodworking," there's a technique for removing
minor dents from wood.  It involves saturating the wood with water and
heating it, to expand the grain.  Perhaps this works with briar too? -S. ]

STOGIEFEST FOUR UPDATE

WHERE:   American University
         4400 Massachusetts Avenue, NW

   Stogiefest Four will be held on April 26th, beginning at 7 PM. The rain
date for the event is the 27th, same time. Our last Fest was held in
November, and suffered due to weather, so this time we remembered to think
ahead. Hopefully the weather will cooperate this time.

   For those of you who aren't familiar with Stogiefest, it is a free
outdoor event at the American University in Northwest Washington, D.C. It
isn't anything special, shall we say, but it is the highlight of the
semester for myself, and hopefully for others too. Stogiefest is a great
opportunity to meet people, enjoy fine cigars, and for many people to try
something new. Stogiefest often seems to become a mini-clinic of sorts, with
experienced smokers teaching the uninitiated. It is my hope (but not
guarantee) that we will have some new things at this fest, to make the event
more worthwhile for those who travel any distance to get here.

   If you have any resources or ideas you'd like to present, mail me at
???????@????????.???. We still are looking for someone who might be willing
to sell cigars, as our funds are limited and cannot be ventured. We usually
have little idea of how many people will want to buy cigars, as opposed to
those who bring their own, but generally the ones we have sell fairly well.
At this time I am uncertain as to the requirements for an event vendor, but
if you are interested in this, write me and I'll find out quickly. Also, I
hope to make shirts or another souvenir item for this Fest. If this idea
interests you, also write me. If the response is great enough, I'll research it.

I have smoked cigars for at least 6 months now, and my parents aren't too 
happy about my cigar smoking. They regard all smoking as bad. I explain 
that I don't inhale, yet they don't listen. It's not like I smoke a lot 
either. In a week, I usually smoke 3-7 cigars. I don't even know how I 
got started smoking cigars. I was just seeing what many pipe and cigars 
smokers' opinion on this situation.

[ Well, David, it's an unfortunate situation; it seems like your
parents have bought into the "all tobacco is evil" mentality.  But if
you're of age to smoke cigars, and if you're not, er, creating new
aromas in their house, then it's your own business.  Perhaps agreeing
to disagree may be the best for now. -S. ]

 Steve;
Just a short note to tell you how much I am enjoying your digest.  Living on
the eastern shore of Maryland, there are not a lot of outlets for pipe
smokers, although I did treat myself to a new Merschaum today.  It's a
second, but a beatiful one at that.
There is a unique joy in smoking a pipe for the first time, perhaps like
meeting a new friend. 
I have read much in the way of opinion as to what is the best kind of pipe
to smoke, but I would imagine that in the long run the best one is the one
that you enjoy best, be it a Dr Grabow, or a Merschaum, or a good briar.  I
have smoked a pipe on and off for over 20 years, smoking cigarettes mainly
inbetween.  The cigs are gone for good.
After taking up the pipe again, cigarettes hold no interest for me and in
fact are not at all enjoyable.
I have also read with much interest the comments on letting a pipe rest
between smokes. I have some pipes that are used daily and often do not have
a chance to cool completely between bowls.  Will this cause damage to the
pipe?  Also, just how much should I let the bowl build up?  

Keep up the good work.

Richard 

[ Eastern shore of Maryland?  My grandmother, may she rest in peace,
lived in Easton.  Re resting the pipe, I like to do so, though some
people say it makes no difference. -S. ]

Like many people I have found myself going from a cigar smoker who
occasionally smokes a pipe to a pipe smoker who occasionally smokes a

A pipe question for you if you don't mind.  I received a pipe as a gift a
while back but I don't know if it requires a filter or not.....It is made in
Denmark and has the markings "(one word can't make out then Danish" and the
number 62 afterwards with a picture of a 3 peaked crown on the stem.  It is
a beautiful rough grained pipe with carved finger pads on both sides.  I luv
the smoke (use it as is) but wonder if it requires a filter.  The purchaser
advises that the store has since moved and whereabouts unknown.  Any
information anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.

P.S.  I look forward to PD and thoroughly enjoy all the letters.  Keep up

Scott Bufosky asked about the content of Dunhill's Elizabethan Mixture. 
 It is, according to the can it comes in, a mixture of virginia and 
perique tobaccos.  There are a lot of pressed tobaccos around in a 
similar formulation, but few, like Elizabethan Mixture, come ready 
rubbed.

I have managed to create my own by mixing a blend that is acutally mixed 
at John B. Hayes Tobacconists called "Tom's Red and Black" (which is a 
blend of red and black virginias) with perique.  My blend is 7 parts 
Toms to 1 part perigue.  Some folks find this percentage of perique to 
be a little too much, but many like it.

Greetings Steve!

Thanks much for your dedicated service to all of us pipe smoking enthusiasts on 
the Internet.  I've learned perhaps more in one year of reading Pipes Digest 
than I did in all of my previous years of pipe smoking.  Thanks also to your 
many readers and submitters who've educated me on topics ranging from Irish 
Twist tobaccos to the latest purification techniques for restoring sweetness to 
pipes gone sour.

I'm a big fan of oriental mixtures and matured Virginia blends.  St Bruno and 
Condor are at the top of my list, as are Dunhill's Standard Mixture Medium and 
Nightcap (particularly during the evening).  Actually, I experiment with a 
fairly wide range of mixtures and blends, but the above four have withstood the 
test of time.  They just seem to keep getting better and better, year after 
year.

I had the thrill of visiting Dunhill's Tobacco Bar last January during a trip
to 
England.  I was surprised to learn that many of the Dunhill mixtures that had 
previously disappeared in the U.S. (e.g Aperitif, Baby's Bottom) are still 
available at the Dunhill store in London!  The store personel were very
helpful, 
and provided me with a type-written list of their available mixtures with brief 
descriptions.

Given the amount of discussion in PD and alt.smokers.pipes about Dunhill
blends, 
I thought there might be an interest among your readership in seeing the 
mixtures that are still available through their store.  Below, I've included a 
copy of the original type-written text.  Hopefully, most of it survived the 
scanning and OCR process.  Someone wrote to me recently saying that Dunhill can 
make any of these blends available via mail-order.  I've even heard that they 
will exclude the tax and duty for orders of a certain size, but I haven't 
confirmed this yet.

The only address and number I have for Dunhill are:

Alfred Dunhill Pipes Limited
32 Saint Andrews Road
London E17 6BQ
England

Fax: 0181-523-2816

If anyone out there has any experience ordering pipe tobacco directly from 
Dunhill, I would very much appreciate a short email with any helpful 
information.  Thanks in advance!

[ These lists differ slightly; some blends are present in one that are
absent in the other, the descriptions differ, and I strongly suspect
that someone made a typo in one of the mixture numbers (though I can't
say which.) It might very well be worth editing them into one. -S. ]

&gt;   I wanted to pass along a hint about humidification to the other members 
&gt; of the group.  I use a combination of table salt and water to regulate 
&gt; humididty. 

I do that, and it works, but sometime during the night when everybody is
asleep the salt creeps slowly up the side of the container I've got it in, 
climbs over the top to drop to the bottom of the humidor, then slips out
the crack in the bottom to hide amongst the carpet. What are you all using
to keep the salt solution in, and do you beat it occasionally to keep it
at bay?

Really. I don't know enough about physical chemistry to know why, but I get
an absolutely dry salt crust up the sides of the container, on the bottom
of the humidor, and on the floor. 

My humidor is a mirror doored medicine cabinet set into the wall (dirt
cheap at any good hardware store) so the door is vertical, and the salt
is escaping through the weatherstripping I added to the door.

And this gave me a horrendous chuckle:

Somebody said
&gt;         The Tobacco Tavern in State College PA (see the resource guide)
&gt; carries a clove scented pipe tobacco called "Punkin' Pie."  

and then
&gt; (all blending is done in house, with no wacky additives)

Cloves are obviously perfectly ordinary additives in a tobacco called 
"punkin pie". Certainly an after-dinner blend; before dinner one would
have a bowlful of 'pipe stuffing', with sage and onions. ;-)

(all in fun; if I can find a sample I bet I'll like it.)

PIPE MAKING FOR THE RANK AMATEUR BY ROBERT EVERETT
 
[After making Bob Everett's acquaintance through e-mail, I kept badgering
him until he joined the OPC.  Then, after discovering that he had just
started making pipes, I badgered him again until he agreed to write an
article for the newsletter.  I'm quite pleased with all the results of my
badgering.  Bob can be reached at 1275 Marine Drive, Anacortes WA 98221 or
by e-mail at ???@?????.???.???.]
 
Background
 
When he learned that I had created a handful of briar pipes during the last
couple of months, Bill Unger asked me to render my experiences and any
hints developed during this foray into undying prose for the education and
enlightenment of the membership.  Being even more of an amateur at writing
than I am at pipe making, I must beg for your forbearance as you read on. I
have been a pipe smoker and in a small way a collector for the last 40
years or so.  During that time, I frequently wondered while I admired or
smoked some pipe maker's masterpiece if such creativity was in the realm of
possibility for the average bloke (read "me").  The answer was, for a long
time, no way, man!  Last Christmas, however, Harold Berlin, my best buddy
of some 30 years standing and also a pipe smoker, threw me a real curve.
Over the years, he and I had frequently discussed the various attributes
that go into making a pipe a success, both artistically and as a good
smoke, and had wondered together if we could make a pipe of professional
quality given the materials and the time.  His method of bringing the
matter to a head was to present me with a briar block and a stem blank as a
Christmas gift along with a challenge to get off the dime and make a pipe.
 
Arming myself with a copy of Stemco-Pimo's booklet Pimo's Guide to
Pipe-Crafting at Home, I headed for the shop to see what I could come up
with.  To make a long story short, after about 12 hours of work, I held in
my hands my first pipe, a Danish-style freehand with plateau (that is, the
rough, naturally knobby surface of the briar) bowl top and stem end similar
in shape and style to various Ben Wades and Preben Holms that are among the
favorites of my small collection.  I'm sure I was guided, albeit
unknowingly, in shaping that first pipe by some of the attributes I had
admired while handling and smoking the pipes of the Danish masters.
Bursting with pride, I rushed to show my creation to Hal.  He was stunned!
Well, I want you to know that this initial success created a monster.  I
rushed an order to Stemco-Pimo for a supply of briar blocks and assorted
stem blanks and haven't looked back since.  The thing that really amazed me
and continues to do so is that making pipes really isn't all that
difficult. All one needs are a few basic tools, the pipe materials and a
plan of action.
 
Basic Tools
 
Borrowing from Pimo's booklet on pipe making, I'll describe a minimum tool
set and then mention a few special tools that might make the job easier or
more pleasurable.  But one can get by easily with a vise, a square, a small
saw (coping saw or hacksaw), assorted files, assorted sandpaper and an
electric hand drill with assorted bits.  Additional tools, such as a
special drill bit for boring the tobacco hole, a tenon turning tool, buffs
and cutters, are available at a cost that will fit into most people's
budget without breaking the bank.
 
I am fortunate to have a small Shopsmith combination lathe, a bench
grinder, a bench motor with tapered spindles for wire and buffing wheels
and, most useful of all, a Foredom flex-shaft hobby tool with a large
assortment of cutting, grinding and polishing accessories.  I use these
tools because I have them in the shop, but one could easily get by with the
basic list and the Pimo booklet's advice on how to use them most
efficiently.
 
Pipe Materials
 
As my pipe-making experience is limited to a handful of briar pipes,
predominantly freehands, I'll stick to briar in outlining the materials
necessary.  Basically, two materials--briar and stem stock--are needed to
construct a pipe.  These, however, are available in many different forms
and qualities.  I'll tell you what I think, although it may not agree with
what you might read or hear from other, admittedly more knowledgeable, pipe
makers. The briar burl is found in the root system of the white heath,
Erica Arborea, a relatively low-lying tree-like shrub found primarily in
the mountains and valleys of such Mediterranean countries as Greece,
Algeria, France, Spain and Italy, where it grows in harsh, rocky soil.  The
burl, a nodular growth above the roots, is found just beneath the earth's
surface and is considered by many to be the finest material available from
which to carve a smoking pipe.  I'll forego discussing the methods by which
the briar burls are gathered, cut and cured and discuss only that part in
which we are interested.
 
The burl is cut into manageable blocks for pipe making prior to marketing.
These blocks are referred to as either ebauchons or plateaux (French).
Ebauchons are blocks cut from the burl's interior, where the wood is denser
and less likely to exhibit a beautiful grain pattern.  They are purchased
in huge lots by the commercial pipe making companies and used to make
commercial quality pipes.  Plateaux are cut from the burl's less dense
outer skin, where the wood is much more likely to produce a pipe with the
cool smoking characteristics associated with reduced density as well as a
beautiful grain pattern.  The plateau briar block sold in the pipe making
trade is usually distinguished by an outer skin of bark, which is left in
place.  If it has been removed, the block is still easily distinguishable
by the rough, knobby surface of the burl just beneath the bark.  Most
experts advise beginners to start with an ebauchon for their initial few
forays into pipe making because ebauchons are typically cut in a size and
shape to facilitate making a pipe, and being from the inner, less desirable
part of the burl, they are cheaper.  Here is where I differ from the
accepted philosophy.  I use only extra-grade plateaux.  They cost a few
dollars more but are vastly more likely to yield a pipe with beautiful
grain and excellent smoking characteristics.  My thinking is that if I'm
going to spend 8 to 12 hours creating a pipe, why start with a $4 or $5
ebauchon, which will almost assuredly produce a less-than- satisfying pipe,
when, for $12 or $14, I can start with an extra- grade plateau that will
maximize my possibilities for creating a truly nice pipe?  For a few
dollars more, plateaux are available from which more than one pipe can be
cut, but the smaller sizes cut to produce a single pipe vastly simplify the
planning and layout of a pipe in the block for the beginner.
 
Enough about wood; let's talk stem materials.  Most briar pipe stems are
composed of vulcanite (hard rubber, also occasionally referred to as
ebonite) or acrylic.  Acrylic is referred to by several proprietary names.
The most common is Dupont's Lucite, but also encountered are Perspex by
Imperial Chemical Industries, Plexiglass by Rohm &amp; Haas and Acrylite by
American Cyanamid. Both vulcanite and acrylic are available in rods of
varying diameters from which the craftsman can produce pipe stems of any
desired shape and size.  Doing so requires a lathe or drilling jig because
the stems must be drilled, shaped, sanded and polished.  The beginner is
probably better served by purchasing pre-shaped vulcanite stem blanks made
in presses that only require final shaping, sanding, bending (if desired)
and polishing.  They are available in a wide variety of styles and sizes
both for standard shaped pipes and freehands.
 
Plan of Action 
 
Before actually starting to form your pipe from the briar plateau, I advise
you to prepare a plan of action, which will be controlled to a large degree
by the size, shape and grain characteristics of the particular block you
are working with.  In order to get a good idea of what lies within the
bark-covered, rough-sawn plateau, I recommend first cleaning it up a bit.
The outer surface's bark covering can be readily removed by vigorously
applying a wire brush or a wire wheel on a drill or bench motor.  I've used
both methods and recommend the mechanical version if you have the equipment
as being much quicker and less difficult.  One must wear eye protection
because the bark and small bits of wire are shed from the wheel with
projectile force. I wear a full-face shield while engaging in this process,
and I frequently hear the resounding "ping" of some errant bit of wire
bouncing from the shield.  Much better than finding it stuck in my face!
Have no fear that the wire wheel will deface the plateau surface, leaving
it unsuited for use as a handsome knobby pipe top or stem end.  The briar
is tough enough that only the bark is removed, leaving a clean plateau
surface.
 
The next step in preparing a block is to sand the outer surfaces, which
have been rough sawn to a smooth surface that reveals the grain pattern.
When the plateau is sawed, the sides and bottom are normally kept square
with one another.  When you sand, be sure to retain this squareness.  It
will allow you to plan the drilling of the tobacco and smoke holes
precisely so that they meet at the proper place within the block.  Once
your plateau is clean, I suggest that you wipe it with alcohol, which will
cause the grain to stand out momentarily and will give you a realistic
picture of what you may expect to find as you begin carving.  I find it
helpful at this point to roughly sketch with a soft lead pencil various
potential designs for my pipe on the side of the block.  The marks are
easily erased, and one may proceed until a design is reached that seems to
fit within the available wood and that makes the best use of the grain
pattern.  Another advantage of cleaning up the blocks and doing this
preliminary sketching is that you can frequently figure out ways to come up
with a nice- looking pipe while cutting away parts of the block that
display obvious flaws.
 
At this point, perhaps a few words about flaws in the briar are in order.
You will seldom if ever find a piece of briar burl completely free of
flaws, which may appear as cracks, sand pits or small pockets of foreign
matter and may be found on the visible surface of the block or hidden deep
within.  Although most flaws, if left visible on the outer surface of your
finished pipe, will not affect the smoking quality, one usually strives,
simply from a desire for beauty, to achieve a finished product that
displays no flaws.  I must admit, however, that strive as one may,
achieving a finished product absolutely free of visible flaws is seldom
possible.  Even the most advanced professional pipe makers may find a pit
or crack just as they are doing the final sanding on a hitherto flawless
masterpiece.  In this case, one must accept the flaw, remove it and use a
fill or continue removing wood in the hope that the flaw is shallow enough
to be sanded away without spoiling the pipe's shape.  Another method
frequently used by professionals when something like this rears its ugly
head is to revert to a sandblasted or otherwise textured finish in order to
hide the flaw(s).  While I personally admit to liking a well-done sandblast
finish, I prefer a beautifully grained smooth finish, and I find myself
striving toward that end in my own pipe making.  I have made a pact with
myself to never use a fill to hide a flaw in one of my own pipes.  If I am
unable to remove the flaw by further sanding or by using a strategically
located depression (as is frequently done by the Danish masters), I'll
consider sandblasting the pipe (I have the equipment but haven't actually
attempted it yet), or else I'll leave the flaw visible.  If the flaw is
sufficiently disfiguring as to make the pipe unsatisfactory for my own use,
I reluctantly discard it and start afresh with another block.
 
Having sketched an outline of your planned pipe on the side of the block,
the next step is to draw an outline of the tobacco hole and the smoke hole.
It's a good idea, if possible, to center the tobacco hole in the planned
bowl and to place the smoke hole so that it meets the bottom of the tobacco
hole while still running down the center of the planned shank.  In the case
of certain designs with bent shanks, the placement of the smoke hole must,
perforce, come close to the top of the shank at one point in its length.
In such cases it's important to plan the design and shaping so that one
doesn't cut into the top of the smoke hole while shaping the shank.
Certain designs may be best achieved by first drilling the larger hole for
the mortise (that portion of the shank into which the tenon of the stem
fits) to its proper depth of 5/8 to 1 inch in the center of the planned
shank.  Next drill the smoke hole itself, offset somewhat in the bottom of
the mortise so as to facilitate meeting the bottom center of the tobacco
hole more easily.  Once your drilling plan is sketched on the side of the
block, it is time to begin actually making your pipe.
 
Making the Pipe
 
The first step in actually making your pipe is drilling the smoke hole and
mortise and the tobacco hole.  The Pimo booklet describes a home-made
drilling jig constructed from scraps of plywood that will help make this
important step less fraught with possibilities for error.  With the jig, a
3/8" electric hand drill and the proper bits, drilling can be accomplished
with every prospect of success.  I am fortunate to have a Shopsmith lathe
in the shop and find that, with the proper setup, I prefer using this handy
tool.  The key to success when using one tool or the other, however, lies
in accurately measuring the angles and depths of the holes you're going to
be drilling as related to the square outer surface of the briar block.  I
first drill the smoke hole and mortise and then the tobacco hole.  If the
depth and angle of the smoke hole are accurately controlled, meeting the
tobacco hole exactly in the center of the bottom is simply a matter of
carefully drilling the tobacco hole while frequently pulling the bit out as
you near the planned depth to visually check the bottom of the hole.  When
the smoke hole becomes visible, carefully proceed, using a light touch with
the drill, until the relationship of the holes with one another is optimal.
 
For drilling the tobacco hole, I highly recommend the special bits sold by
Stemco-Pimo; they will produce a hole of the proper size with the proper
rounded bottom contour.  A set of three bits in sizes appropriate for most
pipes costs about $16.  You could, of course, make your own bits by shaping
commercial spade wood bits to the proper contour on a grinder.  Another
possibility that I have considered but not yet tried is to use contoured
milling burrs of the proper shape and size, which I have seen in tool
supply catalogs.  These are designed to mill holes in metal and would
undoubtedly work equally well in briar burl and would perhaps leave an even
smoother inner surface to the tobacco hole than a wood bit does.  Sanding
the interior of the tobacco hole on a finished pipe is rather difficult
because of its limited size and rather deep contour, so any help in tarea
would be most welcome.
 
When the drilling is finished, you are ready to begin shaping your pipe to
its finished contours.  Briar burl is a very hard wood, and you will
quickly find that removing large quantities of stock with a coping saw or
hacksaw by first cutting off corners and other portions of the plateau that
fall outside the lines of the finished pipe will save you much time and
effort.  (Save these pieces!)  Be sure to leave sufficient stock for small
changes in shape to allow for removal of interior flaws that might be
uncovered in the sawing.
 
You may choose among several tools to actually shape the pipe. Experienced
wood carvers might prefer a knife.  However, I believe that the hardness of
the material makes files more appropriate.  Even better is a hobby tool
such as a Foredom flex-shaft or even a Dremel tool if you have one
available.  I am fortunate to have a Foredom flex-shaft tool and a
selection of cutting, grinding and drilling bits available in the shop.  I
use this tool almost exclusively to shape my pipes once I have
removed the excess wood by sawing.  The most useful bit I have found
and the one I use about 95% of the time is a 1/2" sanding drum
equipped with the coarsest abrasive availabel (80 or 100 grit).  With
this tool, I shape the stummel (that part of the pipe comprising the
bowl and shank) from start to approximate final shape.  It removes
material quite rapidly, and you should practice with it in order to
insure that you don't inadvertently take off too much in any one
spot.  With a bit of practice, you can use it almost
instinctually, and it allows you to shape the hard burl with amazing ease.
When you use this tool, I recommend that you wear a disposable paper filter
mask to prevent the fine briar dust from clogging your nasal passages.  Eye
protection is also mandatory.
 
When you have achieved a shape that satisfies you, the sanding process
begins.  The object here is to refine the shape to its final lines and to
remove as many flaws as possible (hopefully, all of them) from the visible
surface while arriving at a stummel that is ready for staining and/or
waxing.  I begin the sanding process with 100 grit paper, using hand
sanding or wrapping the paper around an appropriately shaped item, such as
a drill bit, a pencil or my finger, to get at the curved places.  Once I
have completely sanded the stummel with the 100 grit paper, I progress to
150 grit, then 220 grit and on through 400 grit to final sanding with 600
grit paper.  This process sounds fast in the telling, but it actually
consumes more time than the actual shaping of the stummel with the Foredom
tool.  The satisfaction you or anyone will feel from handling and using
your finished pipe is largely derived from the perfection of its finish, so
any amount of time spent to achieve perfection here is time well spent.
When the sanding is completed to my satisfaction, I next wipe the entire
stummel down with alcohol on a soft cloth.  Wiping serves to remove
sanding dust and to expose any flaws that the dust may have hidden or any
scratches left by the final sanding.  Almost invariably when I carefully
examine the stummel, I find some tiny spot that I didn't sand quite
thoroughly or some tiny flaw that I think could be removed by further
sanding.  This, mind you, after I was virtually certain that I had done a
perfect job in the first place!  I have been known to revert to the 220
grit or the 400 grit level as many as three times on a single stummel
before finally arriving at what I consider an acceptably sanded end
product.  I don't know if my oversights are caused by poor eyesight on my
part or being in a rush to get the sanding done or if they are a normal
occurrence, but I really hope to get better at this part of the game with
practice.

Staining and Waxing the Pipe

The final step in preparing your stummel for use is to apply a stain--if
you want to--and a through waxing.  Many pipes will be enhanced by a stain
that brings out the grain or simply changes the color of the
unfinished wood to something more in keeping with the maker's aesthetic
feelings.
Pipe makers use alcohol- based stains that are available in a myriad of
hues and shades. I prefer a briar pipe to look like it's made of wood
rather than some brightly colored substitute material, so I tend to stick
to a natural finish if the grain is up to it or a light walnut or cherry
finish if the grain needs the help.  You can stain the small pieces of
wood removed with your saw when you first began to
shape the pipe to determine
which color works best with this particular piece of wood.  I apply the
stain with a Q-Tip, being careful not to allow it to run down inside the
bowl.  When the stummel is dry after a minute or so, I burnish it with a
piece of 0000 steel wool to remove excess stain and to lighten the stained
surface to the desired shade.  If the pipe is a plateau-topped freehand,
you may wish to use a darker stain or even a black stain on the plateau
surface.  If you do, take special care to prevent the dark stain from
running down the outside of the bowl.  I prefer to use the same color
stain that I plan to use on the sides of the bowl but to just apply it
more heavily on the plateau top.  Then I'll usually lighten the bowl
color to some degree during my steel wool burnishing, thus giving a
nice contrast between the top and sides of a plateau-style bow.

Having stained your bowl to a satisfactory color, you're ready to
apply the wax.  I recommend pure carnauba wax, which is used by most,
if not all, professional pipe makers and gives the hardest, longest-lasting
finish of
any wax.  It is so hard that it cannot be applied by wiping on like most
other waxes. Carnauba must be applied by holding a chunk of the wax against
a spinning cloth buffing wheel to charge the buff and then using the
charged buff to apply the wax to the pipe.  With care, this waxing
procedure will result in an extremely hard glasslike polish on the pipe
that cannot be achieved with any other wax.  Other waxes are available that
will do an acceptable if less satisfactory job, but I recommend pure
carnauba.
 
Fitting the Stem
 
I have left for last the subject of fitting your pipe with a stem so that
you can actually smoke it.  Because I have concentrated primarily on
Danish-style freehands in my pipe making thus far, I can leave making the
stem until last.  If, however, you have decided to make a standard shape
for your first effort, shaping the stem must be integrated into shaping the
shank of the stummel.  With standard shapes, the stem is exactly the same
diameter and shape as the shank and must therefore be shaped together with
the shank to get a smooth junction.  In the few standard shapes I have made
thus far, I haven't found this difference to cause any particular problem.
I tend to simply place the stem in the stummel once I have turned the
tenon down to the proper diameter and then to shape the stem and shank as
if they were a single piece of material.  A freehand pipe, on the other
hand, seldom uses a stem that is formed as a continuation of the shank. 
In most freehands, the stem is a fancier shape, with symmetrical grooves
and/or bulges, and it may be conveniently shaped and sanded apart from the
stummel one the tenon is turned to the correct diameter.  Stemco-Pimo
offers a clever tool designed to be used with a hand drill to turn tenons
to size.  I haven't used this tool because I have devised a method of
doing the job using the Shopsmith, but if you don't have a lathe, it
appears to be quite adequate for the job.  Needless to say, the tenon must
be turned to precisely the diameter of the mortise to ensure a snug fit
when the pipe is assembled.

Once you have shaped your stem to the desired contour and sanded it to a
smooth finish using only the finer grits of paper (320, 400 and 600), it
is time to bend it to its proper curve to enhance the pipe for which it is
intended (unless of course it is to be left perfectly straight). 
Vulcanite stems, which comprise the majority of stems in the pipes I have
made thus far, may be bent quite simply with materials at hand in every
home.  First run a pipe cleaner through the stem so that it protrudes from
both ends.  Bend the ends to 90 degrees more or less from the line of the
stem.  Put the stem and pipe cleaner in a small oven-proof container and
cover it with a layer of table salt.  Place the container in your kitchen
oven set to a temperature of 270 degrees F for 10 or 15 minutes or until
the stem gets soft enough to bend easily.  Remove the stem from the salt
by grabbing the exposed pipe cleaner.  Using a folded handkerchief or
other cloth to prevent scorching your fingers, ben the stem to the desired
degree.  Hold the bend in place  
with your hands and the cloth until the stem has cooled
sufficiently to retain its shape unaided (only a minute or so).  Remove the
pipe cleaner and try the stem in the pipe to see if you like the looks of
your job or if you want to add or subtract from the bend or to make a
slightly different arc.  Return the pipe cleaner and heat and bend again as
desired.
 
Once you're satisfied with the bend, you may proceed to the final finishing
of the stem, which is accomplished by burnishing with 0000 steel wool and
polishing on a motor-driven buffing wheel charged with tripoli.  You may,
of course, use your electric hand drill to turn the buff, using the jig you
built earlier to hold the drill.  Assemble your stem and stummel and gaze
in awe at what your hands have wrought.  I'm certain that you'll be pleased
with it and that it will hold a special pride of place in your pipe rack
henceforth.
 
Smoking My Pipes
 
In the initial smoking of my hand-crafted pipes, I have followed standard
recommendations for loading and breaking in.  I do not stain or otherwise
finish the interior of the bowls of my pipes other than by sanding to
remove the drill marks.  The bare wood may be coated with a thin coating
of honey for the first smoke if that is your normal method of breaking
in a new pipe.  I find that my pipes, being made from the finest of
plateau briar available to me, break in and smoke much as any fine
Danish freehand might be expected to respond.  I start with a half-bowl
of tobacco for the initial few smokes and quickly progress to a full
bowl after two or three bowls.  Thus far, I have determined that if the
geometry of the smoke hole versus the tobacco hole is correct, one may
expect a sweet, cool smoke right from the first puff and that it only
improves as the pipe breaks in.  I attribute this to the use of
high-quality plateaux as raw material and care in the planning and
drilling of the tobacco and smoke holes.

Conclusion

In preparing this description of one amateur's methods of pipe making,
I have borrowed heavily from what I learned by reading Pimo's Guide to
Pipe-crafting at Home.  This booklet will greatly amplify many aspects
of pipe making for the amateur that I have barely skimmed or
inadvertently omitted entirely.  Although I am sure that other
references are available, I haven't been successful in locating any and
thus recommend the Pimo booklet most heartily.  Stemco-Pimo, a small
company owned by pipe makers Al and Ginny Baier, has been my only
source to date of materials and supplies, and I find no fault with
either their service or their materials.  I do not, by any means,
desire to cast aspersions on any other suppliers who may offer the same
or similar services and materials.  I am simply unaware of their
existence.  Should the aspiring pipe maker desire to use their
services, Stemco-Pimo may be contacted at Stemco-Pimo Inc., Butternut
Lane, P.O. Box 2043, Manchester Center, VT 05255; tel. (802) 362-3371.

 I hope that reading my description may cause some of you who may have been
wondering if pipe making was something within your reach to believe that it
really is.  I doubted for years that I possessed the ability to make a
decent pipe "from scratch."  In so doubting, I cheated myself out of an
awful lot of fun as well as who knows how many pipes.  --Smoke in Peace,

        Steve:

Just a short note to share the excitement of my recent merschaum purchase.
It is probably a second (based upon the price) but is non the less
beautifully carved.  The only visible fault I can find is a curve in the
shank leading up to the stem.  I had the chance to smoke my first bowl last
night.  It's almost ceremonial.

I do have a question in regards to the amount of build up one should allow
in a briar.
While I don't scrape mine all of the way down, I do feel at times that the
'cake'(?) is becoming too thick.  Is there any rule of thumb in this matter.
Any advice will be appreciated.

[ I usually keep it to about the thickness of a dime or less; this is
less than the rule of thumb, which is a nickel. -S. ]

Hi, Steve,

I just received my first in-the-email-box issue of Pipes Digest. Thanks for
signing me up.  

I decided to give pipe smoking a try as something to enjoy on a part-time
basis while I travel for sales. I purchased a GBD American (2 weeks ago) at
Pipes by George here in Raleigh. The price was $42, and he knocked 15% off
that because the vulcanite stem had "leached some sulphur" and turned
slightly yellow.  Supposedly I can fix this with a real good buffing. I
believe I got a good pipe for a good price. I've smoked about a dozen bowls
by now, and am already becoming a real fan of my pipe. There's been
relatively little trouble with the learning process. I've tried blends sold
by the pipe shop called Cameroon, mild tobac English, Nougat (really
great!), Mr. T and Cherry Cavendish. I've received aroma compliments from
office cohorts on the Cameroon, Nougat and Cherry Cavendish blends. My
favorite is the Nougat.

Gurgling has been a slight problem on a couple of the aromatic blends, but
the remedy seems to be to stop puffing for a short while, then resume before
I have to relight. This helps for a few minutes.

Reading future PD's will be a real pleasure while I light up another bowl.

Thanks again!

Greetings Steve and fellow PD members!

I just wanted to drop a note concerning a depressing situation where I go 
to school.  I'm a 22 year old college student at the University of 
California, Irvine.  In 1989, our chancellor and eventual President of 
the University of California, Jack Peltason banned the sale of cigarettes 
on campus.  Recently, there was a movement to repeal that ban, which 
sprang from the desire of some students to have a monthly pipe and cigar 
night at our on-campus pub.  The movement had a lot of support; most 
students questioned stated that the University's policy on cigarette 
sales smacked of hypocrisy.  A university is supposed to foster mature, 
adult, and intelligent thought-processes and yet here were these 
bureaucrats refusing to let adults do just that!  Well, surprise 
surprise, but the University, under the explicit direction of Assistant 
Dean Manual Gomez, stopped the movement in its tracks.  

Oh well, chalk up a defeat for those who have the nerve to be mature adults.

Greetings,I'm quite excited. As you know I just started receiving the
Digest. I read a question from a blind pipe smoker about tips. I am blind as
well and want to offer some advice.
the person said he doesn't like Butane lighters. He uses Matches.
I am of the opposite opinion. I got this rad butane lighter at Tinderbox.
It costed me $10, great buy. It's stirdy metal (it's made in Germany what
did you expect? no crappy American made plastic here.) Anyways it's
refilable and has a builtin tamper. I recomend them highly. of course the
flame's adjustable as well. now why am I mentioning this? because it's the
easiest. I tried matches but by the time I got it lit the match would be
burning my fingers, and I'd rather burn the side of the pipe a little than
burn my fingers. Admitadly the lighter is hot after use well the metal tip
anyway and I have gotten burnt once or so from it but still. I just hold the
lighter at a 90 degree angle to the bowl, so the flame will be pointing in.
If you are blind, try holding the lighter and without lighting it just trace
the tradjectory of the flame with your finger to see where it'll end up.
I pretty much know by feel and estimation now how to get it lit (now the
problem is KEEPING it lit but I don't think that is the lighter, more
because I forget to take a puff and it goes out.) Zippo's are OKAY but they
are overkill for pipes. Zippos can probably set ANYTHIN on fire you would
want them to. I have a zippo pipe lighter as well but do not use it for my
pipes for the above mentioned reason. One cool thing though is if you've
ever seen them you know the holes in it. well it is really easy to line it
up perfectly ... I hope this helps any other blind pipe smokers for me this
task of getting it lit was really hard to get down consistantly. Rather
unexpected I guess.
keep up the good work on the Digest.
oh yeah one other thing, I've seen some debate about dr. grabbo vs. more
expensive pipes. I used to smoke grabbos (stop laughing) but when Iwent to
Tinderbox picked up a bunch of nie pipes for like $25  a piece. Well worth
it. the cheaper pipes burnt hot a lot, and since I prefer english blends
this is  NOT good. hotness really whacks the flavour. so buy better. You
will not be disapointed,people.
um maybe I should introduce myself.. "Please allow me to introduce
myself.... I'm a man...of wealth and taste..." - Laibach
I'm 18 and go to college here and have been smoking (regularly anyway) since
I started this hellpit in August. but smoked ocasionally before that... I've
found the net.pipesmokers very very helpful except [ Flame deleted. -S. ]
Well,lates (for real)

[ Later... -S. ]

Hi some things I forgot... re the blind thing again, learn to hear the sound
of the lighter lighting. It's really embarrassing to go into public and
trying to puff to light the thing and have the lighter not even be lit...
Also, one thing you may not notice if you can't see it is when you tamp it
be carefu l and take your time or pipe ash will spill everywhere.
and you've heard of the Illuminati? How cool. Lates.

  I've been thinking about tobacco lately. Specifically about which kinds
  smoke hotter.

  I have been smoking Pasha's Dream (C&amp;D), and while I enjoy the taste and
  aroma, no matter what I do it burns my tongue. I've tried packing the
  bowl differently, smoking veeerrrry slowly, with no difference in
  outcome.

  Pasha's Dream is a mix of Virginias. Could this be it?? Do Virginias
  smoke hot?

  What I would truly appreciate is the opinions of fellow pipe smokers in
  regards to how different tobaccos smoke.

  Thank you for your attention,

  proportional to how many times you must swab it out while smoking

Hi Steve,

Thanks for adding me to your susbscription list &amp; thanks for putting out the
Pipes Digest.

I am a 60 year old (two weeks until 61) retired Naval Flight Office,
currently employed as an Information Systems Analyst looking forward to
really retiring in another year.   I smoked a pipe for over twenty years but
quit about eight years ago.  I am just starting to smoke my pipes again
(looking forward to that retirement).  I did keep my pipes in good condition
even though not smoking them.  The only exception was letting the stems
oxidize.  But some very helpful instructions from Nanosh J. Lucas
(???????@????????.???) in answer to a query to alt.smokers.pipes has
resulted in the stems looking like new.

I still have 15 pipes (even after giving several others to my brother)
purchased between 1963 and 1984.  I have a CAO meerschaum, a Savinelli, two
Estella's (Savinelli), a freehand Skuptur by Kabik, a Ben Wade freehand, a
Barantini, three freehand Mastersen's (inexpensive, but nice - think I got
them through a Wally Frank catalog years ago), a beautiful Hilson sandblast
meerschaum lined churchwarden given to me by my wife for Christmas 1963, and
several no-name pipes.  I notice that the price of pipes is a little
different than when I last purchased a pipe!

A small bit of trivia - my Savinelli butane pipe lighter lit the first time
I tried it, even after sitting untouched for eight years.  The only thing I
had to do was remove the tarnish from the silver.

I am buying small samples of different kinds of tobacco to see what I might
like.  The locally blended tobaccos I used to smoke were from a now defunct
tobacconist. During the past eight years, most of the local tobacconists
have disappeared.  There is only one retail store left anywhere in the area
and I don't yet have a warm feeling about that one even after visiting it
three times.  I just returned from a business trip to Washington D.C. and
luckily had time to visit W. Curtis Draper, Tobacconist there.  Now that is
what I call a friendly place.  I was made very welcome and, with the help of
a very knowledgeable gentleman, ended up purchasing four packets of various
blends.  I also took home a catalog and the assurance that they would gladly
welcome my mail order business.  I regret that I did not have time to to
visit the Georgetown Tobacco Store.  But I did send for their catalog this
morning.

I subscribed to the Pipes And Tobacco Magazine and received the first issue
within a few days.  The magazine is great!  I also received a complementary
issue of Pipe Friendly and liked it enough to subscribe to it also.

Keep up the good work Steve...  We appreciate it.

to Doug Cunningham, who was looking for his first quality pipe and wanted
to limit his cost to $30.

        I think it's important to note Ed Burak refers to his least
expensive (under $30) pipes as "Irregulars," indicating briar which is less
well-grained and which may show more sand pits than his other lines.  The
"Irregulars" are offered so that a customer who is not ready to spend $60
or $150 or $500 for a pipe, will not have to leave the shop empty-handed.
Sand pits in the briar need not be considered "defects" as they are NATURAL
to the burl, and are not mistakes made by the pipemaker.  As Ed believes
they are part of the beauty of the wood, not detractions, they are left
unfilled.

        "Irregulars" are not the only pipes offered in the Connoisseur Pipe
Shop [1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st St., Paine Webber Building, New
York, (212) 247-6054].

        Better quality, second-cut briar [as distinguished from plateau (or
first-cut) briar], is used to fashion a broad range of pipes, in most
standard shapes.  Although the shapes are familiar and recognizable as
Billiards, Dublins, etc., they have been designed with Ed's marvelous
creativity and artistry and bear the distinctive "look" of Connoisseur.  A
bent Dublin, for example, definitely looks like a bent Dublin . . . but is
also immediately recognizable as a Connoisseur.  As all the pipes are
hand-made, each one is slightly different from all others of that shape.

        Most of these shapes are also offered in plateau (or first-cut)
briar from the outermost part of the burl.  This is the oldest and densest
wood, promising the coolest, driest, smoothest smoke.  These pipes are more
expensive than those in the previous two groups.

        At the top of the line are the Connoisseur Freehands, each design
unique unto itself, made exclusively from the finest, oldest plateau briar
available.  Connoisseur Freehands start at $225 and range up into four
figures.  Some approximate more familiar designs and some are a quantum
leap beyond what we are used to seeing and are, clearly, smokable works of
art.

        Ed makes all his pipes from one of three types of briar: Grecian,
Calabrian (Italian), or Algerian.  He is said to have purchased "enough"
old Algerian wood when the largest, oldest burls were still available.

        Ed seems to have no particular interest in making STRAIGHT-GRAIN
pipes.  he values density and finess of grain as opposed to verticality.
My two favorite pipes are Connoisseur panels (one a bent Dublin and one a
Freehand).  Each face of a panel pipe presents a diffeent perspective on
the grain:  flame in one place, birdseye in another, complex whorls in
another, etc., always dense and busy.  I bought the Dublin new . . .
watching it color and watching the grain seeming to change as the pipe aged
has been one of my great joys in pipe smoking.  The panel Freehand (bought
pre-smoked at the New York show) looks like the grain has been "splashed"
on from behind.  Flame grain streaks the sides and ends in birdseye ON THE
FRONT OF THE PIPE.  I've never seen another pipe like it!

        I could go on and on talking about my favorite pipes, but enough's
enough.  Besides, the one I was smoking while writing this is done, so I've
got to go reload.  More another time.  Thanks for listening.

        Regards,

<a name="24">Subject: Re: How to locate smoke shops</a>

[Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

I have a couple of things to share with the group today. First is a tool on the 
web which will help you locate smoke shops you have heard about here on the 
Pipes Digest. As all subscribers to this list should know, there is a Resource 
Guide which Steve Masticola has compiled a list of all the shops we have 
submitted in our postings. This guide usually contains the address of each
shop. 
By using the MapQuest Interactive Atlas at <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">http://www.mapquest.com/</a> you can get 
a map that shows exactly where the shop is located.  The program places an
image 
of a stick pin at the address you requested. (I believe this works only for  
locations in the United States at the moment.) You may zoom out to get a
broader 
view, or zoom in to get all the surrounding street names.

I have been planning a trip to Pittsburg, and have printed maps to Blooms 
Cigar Camp and a couple of other shops.  This will allow me to visit them w/out
digging out a city map or making calls for directions. You could use this for 
other things like finding the home of Tom Arnold in Ottumwa, Iowa if you knew 
the address. Hey, go wild!

My second point is to share the results of my latest vacation to the West
coast. 
I went to San Francisco for a few days and I was taken to Telford's Pipe Shop
in 
Mill Valley. Not a large place, but it was crammed full of stuff.  One wall was 
a cigar humidor with a nice variety of premium smokes. There were a large
number 
of humidors and more accessories than I have ever seen in one place. The 
collection of estate pipes was so big that he had to hide display cases behind 
display cases. Since I am a cigar smoker, I was not able to judge the quality
of 
the pipes, but you could spend a lot of time looking!  Nice way to spend an 
afternoon. Here is the address for the Digest:

Telford's Pipe Shop
119 Strawberry Village
Mill Valley CA 94941
415/388-0440

My other find was in Carmel-by-the-Sea. A very small shop called the Carmel
Pipe 
Shop. Not a huge selection, but they did carry the Davidoff cedar matches which 
I couldn't find in Minneapolis. They seemed to have a little of everything, 
pipe, cigars, humidors, lighters, pipe tools, flasks and so forth. If you are 
ever in Carmel, stop by.

Carmel Pipe Shop 
Lincoln Street near Ocean Ave
Carmel-by-the-Sea CA

While I was in Carmel, I found a little resteraunt that had an open area
outside 
which was perfect for enjoying a cigar.  The place has gas fireplaces and 
overhead heaters to keep off the chill. Turns out to be Clint Eastwood's 
resteraunt called the Hog's Breath Inn. 

In closing, Steve, I wish to thank you for sticking to your guns in keeping the 
digest open to both pipe and cigar discussions.  I have enjoyed the stories of 
the pipe smokers just as much as the cigar smokers' input. It is good to have
an 
open mind and learn from others. 

[ Many thanks for the Mapquest site and the shop addresses, David! -S. ]

<a name="25">Subject: Tinderbox Internationale</a>

First, I apologize if I've sent this to the wrong address for posting on the
digest.
  Was reading with interest about Ave Malkin's visit to Stag Tobacconnist in
Phoenix. Yes, it is a chain, and the owner, Gene Duhon (sp?) has 5 stores in
the Valley including Mesa and Scottsdale. In the past they have had a good
selection of pipes and cigars, especially at Metrocenter and Scottsdale
Fashion Square, and treat folks well. In fact, I met my best friend at their
Mesa store, but he has since moved to another, new shop in Mesa, which is
truly impressive.
  OK, now for the disclaimer. I don't work for this new store, but my best
freind does. Of course I want it to do well, but then again I'm moving to
Atlanta in two weeks, so ...
   The new store is Tinderbox Internationale is on the northwest corner of
Southern and Alma School in Mesa, AZ, and is the highest "grade" of Tinderbox
franchise, with only tw nationwide right now but more on the way, they say.
Their cigar humidor is massive and very well stocked. Their pipe selection is
limited (OK, about 80 (and i'm REALLY guessing)  medium to high grades and
more lower grades, but they've only been open two weeks. I'm sure it will
grow as their customers do. Their gift line is pretty cool and they have all
the accessories (Dunhill, S.D. Dupont etc, but I don't think Davidoff,
((Yet?!)))
   My friend, Paul, has extensive knowledge in pipes and cigars (12 years in
the biz, more than 400 pipes ((OK, some are *^$#^)). Another emp, Derrick
(sp?), isn't too shabby himself, especially on the cigar end.
   One of the most exciting things about this store is Club Amante, a private
club for members only at $300 a year. They have (will, i should say. Club
opens this weekend) a big screen TV, wet bar, fridge, etc. Also available are
humidified lockers. Club members get a discount and gifts with membership
(Zino cutter and cigar travel case). Businesses can hold semi-private
meetings there.
   Sadly, the club is really important to Mesa since voters passed an
extremely prohibitive smoking ordinance that bans smoking in almost all
public places including most bars and restaurants, movie lines, baseball
parks! and golf courses!!!!! It was just passed this last month and it's yet
for city council to "interpret" it, but it's the toughest in the state and
probably the West. Smokers of Mesa, Where were you election day???
   So adios, I'm moving to Atlanta, and have no idea of a good tobacconist
there and would welcome suggestions at CAP MCrit (i'll be living near
Perimeter mall and working at the AJC downtown). Better suggest fast, 'cause
I'll be losing that E-mail address soon  (hopefully to be replaced with AJC
Crit, but I don't know yet).

[ Hope you can send me an address for Club Amate before the email goes
away; I'd be very pleased to put them in the Guide.  As I've said
before, an excellent response to an execrable law. -S. ]

Hello Steve,

I haven't been writing to the digest for long, so I thought it was the moment
for a few lines.

First of all, thanks for the digest, always amazing and interesting. I agree
with your policy of leaving it as open as possible, sometimes I've found
interesting information in articles that seemed very marginal.

Some data that you might be interested to put into the guide:

Barcelona Pipa Club
Placa Reial, 3 pral
08002 Barcelona
Tel +34 3 302 47 32
Fax +34 3 301 11 65

This is a pipesmoker's private club. Many activities are conducted every
week, and there are jazz sessions on some evenings. They have a very
victorian-like pub dedicated to Sherlok Holmes and a pipe museum. Actually
I'm a member and I was thinking in leaving a weekly copy of the digest in the
club, would you mind if I do so Steve? Any occasional pipesmokers visiting
the city are very welcome!

Gimeno
La Rambla, 100
08002 Barcelona
Tel +34 3 302 09 83

This is a well assorted tobacconist, with a lot of pipe stuff. I think that
already wrote about this shop, but didn't remember the correct address and
phone. Bear in mind that there is already a second shop named Gimeno in the
guide, much better assorted in pipes, but not selling tobacco. I know it's a
bit confusing, but our city is like this.

L'Estanc de Laietana
Via Laietana, 4
08003 Barcelona
Tel +34 3 310 10 34

Fairly assorted tobacconist. The Dunhills are not visible, you have to ask
for them, a guarantee for perfect state.

A suggestion for the webb site:

I would find very helpful a guide of pipe tobaccos, that would be
alphabetically structured and also with brands groupped by categories. I
think that digest readers could contribute with descriptions and critics
about brands they know.

As an example (could be included):

Dunhill Blender's Own

This is one of Dunhill's hand blended mixtures. It's aromatic, but with a lot
of character. It includes perique, a bit of latakia, and some vanilla aroma.
Not strong, smells well but heavily for your companies.

Well, hope this is not to much.

Thanks again,

Ricard.

[ You're more than welcome to leave copies of the Digest with
Barcelona Pipa Club, Ricard!  Gimeno is already in the Guide, but with
a different address (Paseo de Gracia, 101). Has there been a change,
or are there two stores? -S. ]

<a name="28">Subject: New Smoker</a>

	Well I have never been much of a pipe smoker. But I have
always enjoyed the smell of my relatives pipes, I never relay thought
about it until recently, but I have always really admired my relatives
who did smoke pipes.
	My mom was born and rased in Copenhagen Denmark and most of
the men on her side of the family smoked pipes.
	My dad was born and rased in Totten Masochists but my grand
pa(the pipe smoker whom I admire the most) is from Canada. He is
actually french Canadian thus the name Marcotte.
	Well back in the 60's my dad was in the military or something
met my mom they got married moved to CA I was born in 71 then my
younger brother Jeff was born in 76.
	In 1990 they divorced when my mom who is a good 10 years
younger than my dad moved left us. My dad moved back to the east cost
and took my little brother with him.
	I became independent around this time renting rooms working
during the day and going to school at night. This was when I started
smoking.
	My parents where both cigarette smokers and I always hatted
it. So one day I went to Wallgreens and invested about 20 dollars in a
pipe a lighter and some tobacco.(This was before I discovered the
beginners guide on the net) after a little practice I kind of got the
hang of it
	This helped me a lot during really stressful semesters. It
also kept me awake by giving me something to do while driving. For a
while I was commuting 90 miles a day. 30 miles to work 30 miles to
school and 30 miles from school to my home.
	What's is weird is that I kind of smoked in secret or only
around certain friends. Around 94 I pretty much quit. This was about
the same time that I landed a cush job with a big corporation. I
bought a house and only smo ked on cold winter nights when I had a
fire going or during times of high stress (which I have had a lot of
lately).
	Well on 4/2/96 Jeff (after numerus attempts at suicide)
Finally passed away as a result of complications from a car
accident. He was drinking and driving no one else was injured.
	I went to a tobacco shop for the first time ever and asked him
for some Cornell &amp; Diehl's Apricots and Cream #3000 which I had red
about on pipes digest #213 He had never herd of it and asked me who I
was buying it for.  Feeling self conches about being a computer
geek(kind of a problem for me)I didn't want to say that I herd about
it on the internet. So I said "um, well what do you have that's really
light and good smelling." Then he sta rted ripping on me and said in a
loud obnoxious voice something like will It depends on what you
consider good smelling Do you want it to smell like frute or fresh
baking cookies. Then all the dudes sitting around smoking cigars
started laughing. Eventually I got him to suggest a tobacco. He said I
should try Bills Blend but first he would half to check my I.D. I
handed him my drivers license and in his obnoxious manner he said "Wow
are y ou really that old". Then I said "what do you think." then the
cigar dudes started laughing at him(well not laughing but one of them
chuckled and that made me feel a little better).I do look young for my
age so I guess I understand.
	I was going to buy my firs real pipe there but ended up just
leaving with my tobacco. The tobacco had good moisture content which
is a first for me the store brands around hear are always vary dry.
	Later the same day after arguing with both my parents. I was
feeling extremely anti social so I grabbed a pile of CD's jumped in my
van and drove to the shore. Bought a bottle of Gold Shloger and a 6er
of Sam Adems pulle d into a camp ground walked along the beach smoked
a few bowl. Bills blend had vary little flavor but I didn't get a hot
smoke like I usually do. Then I drank until I puked
	After puking I mixed a bowl of bills blend with some dried up
Borkum Riff. It made me feel better. It settled my stomach and helped
me to relax and focus. that was when I realized.
 	I was always meant to be a pipe smoker
 	I'm not much of a drinker
 	it does not matter what others think
I'm looking forward to spending the rest of my life as a proud pipe smoker.
	I can picture every one from work staring at me through the 
window as I smoke my pipe for the first time there and looking forward 
to it.
	If I have spelled something wrong excuse me but I also happen to 
be dyslexic. So I guess that makes me just like Albert Einstein, or 
Alexander Gram Bell. they too where dyslexic pipe smokers.

P.S.  Would any one happen to have for sale or know where I could buy a 
Ferdinand Porsche pipe. Also did he ever make a bent?

Regards Tom Marcotte   ????????@??.??????.???.

[ First of all, my sympathies re your brother Jeff.  It sounds like
you've been going through some _major_ tough times recently.

It's not too surprising that you got that response from a pipe shop
guy; after all, he wasn't selling the Apricots &amp; Cream (and probably
didn't know what you were talking about.) But there was no reason for
the proprietor to be insulting.

BTW, I recall seeing Bell's pipe in the museum in Baddeck, Nova Scotia
when I visited there.  Good luck on finding the Porsche pipe; it seems
to be kind of a hot item (no pun intended.) We have all kinds here;
some blind, some dyslexic, and even some computer-geek pipe
smokers. Perhaps even a few brilliant people; certainly some prominent
ones. 

Welcome to the fold, Tom! -S. ]

Here's a little something I found when rereading _The Hobbit_ (a great

    After some time he felt for his pipe.  It was not broken,
    and that was something.  Then he felt for his pouch, and
    there was some tobacco in it, and that was something more.
    Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all,
    and that shattered his hopes completely.  Just as well for
    him, as he agreed when he came to his senses.  Goodness knows
    what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco would
    have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible place.

<a name="31">Subject: Re: whoops</a>

Dear Mr. Comer and everybody else at PD,
	I was just got back from spring break.  I went to Chicago to  
visit a friend who is going to the School of the Art Institute and  
see the city.  As a small-town kinda guy I was surprised that people  
on the street of such a large city with so many different people  
would not only notice, but also mention the fact that I smoke a pipe.   
I even got a few chuckles.  Numerous people would stop to look at me  
and ask, "You smoke a pipe?"  Most of the time I would just stare  
down at my pipe and answer back in a bewildered tone--"Apparently."   
But I got mad when people were condescending, and I had to remember  
all of the subscribers to PD and bite my tongue so I wouldn't answer  
back, "Why, yes . . . I do smoke a pipe.  Fuck you."  As a young pipe  
smoker I actually get a lot of crap--because people think I smoke a  
pipe for attention, or, more often, because people think pipe smoking  
is some token of elitism that I have purposefully acquired in order  
to appear "aristocratic."  Well, obviously the first reason is false  
as I receive a lot of negative attention, although I also receive  
compliments.  But the second reason is VERY false.  I hope that all  
the PD subscribers are doing their best to dispell the myth that pipe  
smoking is a sign of wealth.  It is only a sign of taste.
	I stopped by IRC while I was in the windy city.  That is a  
very nice shop.  The employees were great and I bought the third in  
my collection of Danish Freehand style pipes for 68$.  But, (this is  
the real reason I wrote this letter) I ALSO bought a couple of cigars  
for me and my buddy (remember him?--he goes to school in Chicago).   
He is a big cigar lover.  AND, I spent a couple of days up in  
Waukegan with my Uncle Ray.  My Uncle Ray is a regular ol' cigar  
FREAK--it's enjoyable to smoke with him and talk about cigar brands  
he likes, cigars he's smoked recently, cigars I smoked the other  
night with my buddy, cigar makers, the philosophy of science, the  
early history of the Christian church, my father, etc.  I smoked a La  
Gloria Cubana with my Uncle Ray--I liked it more than any cigar I've  
ever smoked. It was kinda mild, just the right size, and very tasty.  

	The point is: I LOVE cigars.  I don't know nearly as much  
about them as I do about my favorite blends, but I really like them,  
really I do.  I did not mean to disrespect cigar smokers with the  
brevity of the "drop the cigar smokers" comment.  I said this with  
the intention that someone should pick up a seperate digest.   
Certainly it would be a good thing to make the digest a little more  
tidy now that there are so many subscribers.  I'm sorry Bill, I think  
I misunderstood the nature of the digest.  From now on I will skip  
past the submissions that do not interest me (like really long-winded  
letters that get to the point only at the very end, after lots and  
lots of parenthetical comments and many completely unnecessary  
words).  I will scroll on by with the firm knowledge that among the  
2,000 subscribers someone was DYING to read that submission.  And  
maybe, just maybe, I will unwillingly learn something about all those  
cigars I've smoked with my Uncle.

Love, Chris Hamsher

[ Chris, I really don't think this is well-advised, but since you
submitted it, I've printed it. -S. ]

What a delight to find the Pipe Digest and its subscribers! What unexpected
pleasure I found in my first stroll through its conversational threads!

To stumble across the lament of Rich Reitz at the passing of that fine tobacco
Escudo made me feel at home. More, it took away that feeling that comes from
mourning alone the loss of something of which even your best friends are unaware
of the value.

Hogarth's of  Kendal have a replacement tobacco in their Curly Cut De Luxe. It
has very similar smoking characteristics to Escudo and has the same clean
flavour.  My introduction to it came from Coster &amp; Son Ltd, my local retail and
wholesale tobacconist which has an enviable range of pipes and tobaccos.  Some
of their own blends are excellent.  You will find them at 52 High Street in
Marlow Buckinghamshire SL7 1AW, situated in a beautiful small town on the banks
of the Thames, half way between Windsor and Henley (01628 482045).  Well worth a
stop  if you are on a visit to the UK.

Chris Hamsher would like to see more structure in the digest.  You have read the
Digest for longer than I, Chris, but I can only recall that the best trout can
be caught in the gentle meanderings of an English chalk stream and the most
enjoyable walks are on winding paths to a destination of which you cannot be
certain. 

[ Later... -S. ]

After sending my first note to the Digest, I became embarrassed by its
assertiveness. Of course, I meant some of the best trout, not exclusively the
best, are found in meandering English Chalk streams.  As a Welshman, how could I
neglect the small fighting brownies of our own mountain streams. I am certain,
also, that all that I have read about the qualities of the North American Brook
and Rainbow trout leave me open to severe censure on this, my first, Digest
contribution.

In regard to my support for not imposing a structure on the Digest, I will not
back down nor preface with IMHO.  Its quiet delight is the way that it drifts
like the smoke from your bowl on a still summer evening whilst sitting out on
the porch.

Greetings fellow smokers,

       My name is Andy Hacker and I have been smoking cigars for a little
over 2 and a half years and I wanted  to pass a story on to you all and see
if you might have any comments.
I am a graphic designer in the NY/NJ area  who for a while has been trying to
find employment  (which  I am still looking for) and I have a little ritual
that I do every  time I'm in the city. after any interview,  wherever I am
 in the city I manage to make my way over to Nat Sherman and pick up cigars
or a cigar as  the case may be. On this peticular day I had bought a Nat
Sherman Sutton, which is a robusto. I wanted something small to smoke on my
way down to Penn Station. So I lit up and went out on the rarly  beautiful
day in NYC (considering we are still getting snow in April) So, I made my way
down 5th avenue enjoying this sweet tasting  smoke and even though I was
outside walking past many cigarette smokers I still was recieving glares and
dirty looks from occasional people. But I continued on enjoying the cigar.
People walking behind me would quickly walk past me and glance back with an
annoyed look on their faces,  and the smoke wasn't even blowing in their
direction. 
      Why is it that we as cigar or pipe smokers can't even get the chance to
endulge ourselves even  if it is outside? Heck, even cigarette smokers seem
 to look down  on us. And personally I can't stand the smell of cigarettes! 
      Well, anyway I did finish this cigar and I still plan to visit Nat
Sherman whenever I visit NYC  and I will smoke it outside even if I get these
annoying looks from those who haven't yet enjoyed the pleasures of a good
cigar. 

Keep Smoking,  Andy Hacker

ps..just curious, I was wondering if anyone knew of any cigar clubs in the
central jersey area? I know about the Metropolitan cigar society in Wayne,
 NJ but that's a little to far of a travel for me...........thanx

Dear Steve,

I should be grateful if you would publish the following.

Fellow pipesmokers,

Re: Quality Tobacco Uk

It is with refgret that I must announce that we are terminating our Mail Order
service beyond the UK with immediate effect. Unfortunately we have found that
our highly taxed prices are totally uncompetetive in most markets beyond the UK
and that to continue with our service would not be realistic.

I have had the pleasure of exchanging letters with many of you since we launched
our service and have made many new friends in the process. Many of you have
shared experience and Knowledge with me and this has been much appreciated.
I cannot thank you all personally, but I would like to publicly thank Steve
Masticola and Steve Beatty for their support and Don Churn, Kim Bailey, Chet
Gottfried and Bob Jay who all helped immensley

We will continue to operate our Mail order service in the UK and of course our
retail business in Wells, Somerset, England. If any of you visit the UK and can
take the time to look us up, we will be delighted to see you.

Best wishes to all

John Turner

Hi Steve!

greetings from Rome Italy to you and all Pipes Digest subscribers

Thanks for sending me the last two digests.
It's a lot of reading to do, but, by a birds eye glance, looks
like I am going to enjoy it.

Just a few words as an introduction and a small contribution to 
your guide: a couple of pipes museums in Switzerland and northern 
Italy and a few adresses in Rome and Milan to go  for a peaceful
puff and a look at some beautiful instruments of our smoking
pleasure.

In Italy the antismoking lobby, even if not as powerful as in
the USA, are doing their best to make life unconfortable for
smokers generally and are particularly hostile to pipes and
cigars users. They have introduced a bill in parlament to ban
smoking in all public places, including restaurants, bars, sport
arenas, shops. Lot of restaurants already ban smoking or have non
smoking areas, the smoking corner being  the most unconfortable
in the place.
It's nice to have a couple of places to go to and have a puff
without feeling like being confined in a ghetto!

Any pipe smokers travelling to Italy will feel welcome at:

BECKER AND MUSICO'
Via San Vincenzo 29
ROME

This place, a few yards from the Trevi Fountain, is owned by
Paolo Becker, son of the late Frederick. They together started
carving the world famous Becker pipes some 30 years ago, when
Paolo was in his teens. He is now carving unique pieces out of
a stock of long aged briar roots and, somewhat inspired by the 
Danish pipe stile, produces beautiful pipes both in design and 
grain.
His partner, Giorgio Musico', an institution in the Italian pipe
smoking community, is a walking enciclopedia of the pipe and
tobacco world and is a willing counsellor both to beginners 
and long time puffers.
Their store, more a club with its confortable couches, books on
pipes and tobacco and international pipes magazine, is a meeting
point, particularly on saturday. 
Besides Becker pipes, they produce the Becker &amp; Musico' brand,
ranging from inexpensive to medium price and stock some leading
brand names: Charatan, Dunhill, Baldi, Ser Jacopo della Gemma,
Larsen, Ascorti, Ashton, Caminetto.

FINCATO
Via Colonna Antonina 34
ROME   

This is the University of the Rome smoking community.
It is not a place for beginners nor for drug store type pipes.
Castello, Radice, Savinelli Autograph, Caminetto, Ascorti,
Dunhill, Charatan, Bang, Larsen are a few brands on Fausto
Fincato's breath taking display.
Dont'be misled by the small street level shop, where, however,
an impressive choice of cigars, from havanas downwards, and
pipe tobaccos pack the shelfes. Make your way to the first
floor, where, in luxurious surroundings, Fausto will entertain
you and, for sure, make a dent on your credit card, as very
rarely one fails to submit to the many temptations on show. 

NOVELLI
Via San Claudio 39
ROME

This is a good place for a bargain and a must if you are keen
on estate or reconditioned pipes.
Besides being the Italian distributor of Astleys of London,
and storing several leading Italian brands, Diego Novelli is
the Rome estate pipes specialist. You can find an exceptional
variety of both Italian and English brand names, particularly
Dunhill, Castello and Charatan.

LORENZI
Via Montenapoleone
MILAN

It's a store on two levels on the most exclusive shopping
street in the city.
The first level will not interest you, unless you want to
buy knives or shavers.
Go downstairs and enjoy the best show of pipes in Milan.
All the world leading brands are stored.

Close to Milan, on Lake Varese, there is a pipe museum worth
visiting, if one is interested in the technical side of pipe
making.
Besides a collection of some 2000 19th century pipes, an impressi
ve display of pipe making tools are on show

MUSEO ITALIANO DELLA PIPA
GAVIRATE - Varese

and another museum is a must if you visit the Lake Geneva area
in Switzerland.
An unique collection of 17th, 18th and 19th century pipes from
the four corners of the world.
Exceptionally beautiful merschaum and painted porcelain pipes
from Austria, Hungary, Germany, France, Holland and a collection
of original Gambier clay pipes from France, carved wooden pipes
from the far east, metal and cristal pipes and middle eastern
narghiles, all beautifully laid out and displayied.
A couple of hours well spent.

MUSEE DE LA PIPE ET DES OBJECTS DU TABAC
Rue de l'Accademie 7
LAUSANNE - Vaud - Switzerland

And to close a request.
Recently a friend returning from the New York brought me a pouch
of DELACONCHA TURKISH DELIGHT, a tobacco blend that I enjoyed
a lot.
Can anyone tell me where I could order it?

That's all for now.

Thanks to Steve for his good work and pleasant puffs everyone!

<a name="36">Subject: RESPONSE TO JEFF C. JEWELL, P.D. #212</a>

Jeff wants to know where I "came by the information" about my assertion in a
previous issue of P.D. that the difference, between a cheap drug store pipe
and a more expensive quality pipe is in the briar.Or putting it another way,
"the gain is in the grain."

The short answer to Jeff's query is EXPERIENCE. I've been a pipe smoker for
over 45 years, a wood carving hobbiest for over 50 years and a full-time
professional pipe carver with customers world-wide for more than 12 years.
But for  further substantiation I offer Jeff the following excerpt on the
subject from THE BOOK OF PIPES &amp; TOBACCO by Carl Ebiva:

"Bald or grainless wood is not desirable because it is soft and more prone to
burn out than other types. It becomes saturated by moisture more quickly than
grains of fine briars and therefore needs more frequent rests. On occassion,
it fills up with tars to such an extent that it remains sour even after
drying.
High grade pipes will have little of this grainless wood in them. Certain
manufacturers have capitalized on the ignorance of smokers.Rather than try to
educate their potential customers and supply them with high quality products,
they have produced a multitude of gimmicks. Pipes made from metal and low
grade briar, simply cannot in any way compare with the simple designs of high
grade pipes made from excellent, well seasoned prime burls. ...Smokers who
have smoked fine pipes will, with rare exceptions, insist that no metal
baffles or filters be used in their pipes. Why? There is simply no need for
such gadgets in fine pipes. A metal piece constricts the smoke coming through
the channel and increases condensation which ultimately is held in the shank,
causing the pipe to sour faster. It's also a nuisance. A pipe that is
uncluttered through the shank and stem smokes drier and more flavorfully and
is easier to care for.

 ...Only when the smoker begins selecting suitable tobaccos and pipes,
properly cares for his pipe, and develops proper smoking habits, will he
begin to savor pipe smoking.Only then will his pipes stay lit and smoke
sweetly while remaining cool and DRY."

For further information on the subject I refer Jeff to Rick Hackers great THE
ULTIMATE PIPE BOOK.

Thank you in advance, Steve, for the use of all this space.

                               Sincerely,           Al Baier

<a name="37">Subject: Frankfurt, Germany, Pipe Resources</a>

Dear Steve and fellow Pipe Digest Readers, 

Not expecing my comments to apper, I wrote a few issues back without an
introduction, sorry if there was any misunderstandings in my first post.  The
obligatory introduction: I am a 26 year old pipe smoker of several months.  I am
a native of California but have been working in Germany for the past three
years, in Frankfurt for the past two years and before that in Bonn.
Fortunately, I have been able to learn much from the postings and resources for
which I am very grateful.

I know that there are several readers, including yourself, who frequently pass
through Frankfurt on business or vacation or whatever, so I would like to
comment on the Frankfurt area pipe resources, plus a few other things which
might be of interest to anyone here for a few days.  

One German member, Joachim ?, commented that in any German city, the safest bet
would be a tobacco store at the main train station, Hauptbahnhof.  This is true
for Frankfurt as well and also applies to most small tobacco stores.
Furthermore, the duty free shop at the airport has a fair selection of tobacco,
a cigar humidor and a few Dunhill pipes.  There are two tobacco shops with
pipes, cigars, tobacco and cigarettes in the Bahnhof but given the throngs
frequenting them, personal attention is lacking.  Fortunately, there are two
good pipe shops just five minutes away from the Bahnhof which can be reached by
crossing the 
streetcar tracks in front of the Bahnhof and then veering right to
Muenchenerstrasse:

FISCHER, Muenchenerstrasse 22, is a John Aylesburg dealer, with a good selection
of Savinellis but only Savinellis.  There also appears to be a good cigar
selection, although as I don't smoke them very often I can't tell how it
compares with other stores.

Their is another hidden store just two doors down on Muenchenerstrasse 18 called
TABAK WEIDER ( tel 49 69 23 24 81) which is in my opinion the best shop in
Frankfurt.  The owners are a frail but friendly couple.  There is a great
selection of Stanwells, Savinellis, Petersons, Nordings, Vauens and other pipes,
mostly in the DM 100 to DM 200 range, roughly $ 70-150.  They also have a large
selection of tinned tobaccos, pipe tools, stands and other accouterments.  I
have bought three pipes from them which makes them quite generous with the
samples as well.  Because the shop is small you have to ask to see the display
cases where the pipes are stored.  

Unfortunately neither of these shops are very spacious, in fact they are both
quite small.  I doubt if English is spoken in either of these shops but part of
the attraction of the later shop is the caring voice of the propitiers with
their distinctively Frankfurter accents.

Just a warning to those new to Frankfurt: the area around the Bahnhof has gotten
worse in the past few years, one turn to the left walking down Munchenerstrasse
and you will be smack in the middle of the red light district.  Even though the
archictecture is beautiful in the area, I would recommend briskly walking past
any potential shady characters.  Infrequently, some interesting types stop into
these shops as well to pick up air plane size bottles of Jagermeister, vodka or
whatever, just an enhancement to the atmosphere in my 
opinion.  Also the latter shop has begun to pander to some of the locals with a
small selection of water pipes, I still think it is a great shop though.

Another major shopping area with a few good stores is the "Zeil" bounded by the
U Bahn stops of Konstablerwache and Hauptwache; everyone knows what and where
the Zeil is in case you are lost.  Behind the Hauptwache stop is PALM TOBACCO; I
have only window shopped here but the selection seems to have a fair number of
pipes, tobacco and cigars.

In the sprawling Hauptwache U-Bahn station at the west end of the Zeil is
another good pipe shop which I don't the name of.

Finally, just south of the Zeil towards the Main river on Kornmarkt 9 is
TABAKHAUS (tel 49 69 28 78 13).  This is one of the more upscale shop in
Frankfurt with a fair selection of Dunhills, Ser Jacopos, Butz-Choquin and most
other brands.

A block or two farther west from the Hauptwache brings one to a very hidden and
exclusive shop,  TABAK+PFEIFE off the so called Fressgasse at Grosse
Bockenheimer Strasse 52 (tel: 49 69 28 93 46).  They have a excellent selection
of English tobaccos including Rattrays, Hemingway and of course Dunhill with
some interesting Danish/Irish types as well  Their pipes are only the best from
Dunhill, Peterson, Savinelli and Larsen.  The prices are from DM 170 or so for
the Petersons and Larsens all the way up to DM 800 and more for the Dunhills.

Anyone residing in Germany for an extended period of time would be wise to order
the extensive Dan Pipe catalog which is almost 200 pages.  Peter Heinrichs of
Cologne also does mail order.  I have found both of these companies to be very
reliable, shipping is free with most orders in Germany; both are in the resource
guide.  These can also be a convenient way to avoid the restrictive German
shopping laws, Monday-Friday 9-6:30, Saturday 9-2:00.

Anyone looking for German translations of pipe and cigar books should check out
the three story Hugendubel bookshop, Steinweg 12, which is around the corner
from Palm Tobacco just off the Zeil.  They have the German translations of
Hacker's pipe and cigar books.

Finally, I have found a few friendly smoking establishments although no one will
blink an eye in virtually any German restaurant or cafe if you light up.  One
locale is Literaturhaus, Bockenheimer Landstrasse 100 fortunately across the
street from work and around the corner from the American Consulate should you
happen to be there, a converted former residence of a German nobleman, now
dedicated to promoting literature and the arts.  They have a cafe with a good
selection of spirits.  There are frequently readings during the afternoon.  It
is closed on Saturday however.   

The large hotels including Hotel Grand Arabella, Hotel Frankfurter Hof and Hotel
Hessischer Hof all have good lounges with comfortable chairs.  I' ve seen a few
people have cigars brought to them by waiters at the Arabella so there must be a
cigar humidor there.

I would not buy a pipe unless I was going to smoke it but for those collectors
looking for something rare and expensive, I would certainly try TABAK+PFEIFE and
TABAKHAUS before the other places.  The other shops should satisfy the rest of
your yearnings.  As far as including any of these places in the resource guides,
if I had to pick one, it would be Weider.

This is certainly not conclusive, there are several other stores in Frankfurt
but I tried to list those next to the train station and the main shopping areas
that are most accessible to visitors.

I'll be here for a few more weeks in case anyone has questions, perhaps some
German members can comment?

[ADMIN] Some folks may be getting two copies of this issue; this was
due to a mailer glitch at this end.  My apologies for any
inconvenience. 

Also, we now have our own domain, folks!  Vince Calloway and Steve
Beaty (our estimable Webmaster) have provided for us the following:

			<a href="http://www.pipes.org/">http://www.pipes.org/</a>

There are also a number of changes to the Web page, Guide, and Digest
formats, which I'll explain below.

[SPRING] Yes, it's finally getting warm enough here that we can
venture out onto the deck or into the garden, beckoned by the spring
flowers and the intense green of the landscape.  Once there, it's only
fitting that we enjoy a smoke, for we've been cooped up inside for too
long.  And, as Garrison Keillor's old nurseryman noted when confronted
with the dribbles of chaw on his tomato flats: "Plants love tobacco."

So join us outside and light up as we look over the tulips that the
rabbits haven't yet chewed to bits, the oxalis that they won't, and
the nicotiana that they'd better not, listen for the first thrushes,
and admire all that is to be admired...

I posted the following in alt.smokers.pipes, but I thought
I'd offer it here as well.  Hope it sparks some discussion.

I picked up a pouch of Sail Aromatic (in a green pouch).  The label
on the outside says "Smooth Dutch Cavendish."  Naturally, I thought
it would be a typical, "crowd-pleasing" cavendish.  Once I broke
the seal, however, my nose picked up what the inside label told me:
"Sail Aromatic combines the mystique of the Orient with bright,
clear Virginia leaf.  The result is a pleasant blend that never
offends or tires.  A few Latakia leaves add to the lasting charm..."
It was a pleasant smoke, though I'm not too experienced with Latakia
blends.  My question is this:  What qualifies as an aromatic?  I've
always assumed aromatics are the blends that most people say "smells
like a pipe" and react favorably to, while other blends draw reactions
like, "That smells like a burning tire," etc.  What are your comments
on Sail, and how well is it received by non-smokers?

Steve: A submission for the next P.D....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently, The Pipe Digest's regular reader Jim Denton from Cigar.com
received the following interesting request from a member of the U.S. 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. 

"... I am an Army physician deployed with Operation Joint Endeavor in
support of the Bosnia peace mission. I am presently starting a small cigar
club here in Tszar, Hungary. It now consists of mainly novice to early

I enjoy reading PD, but unfortunately I have not been able to get up and 
go to Fader's, my local tobacco store, and buy a pipe for myself. It is 
definitely annoying walking around my neighborhood and getting weird 
looks from people as I smoke a Punch Royal Coronation. It is a very good 
cigar. It's also annoying that most restaurants do not allow smoking. 
It's bad. Lately, I have been smoking a smaller cigar, they're called 
Biddies by Agio. They arenot bad, yet they leave a hot taste on your 
tounge. I was wondering if there was a smaller cigar, which is 
inexpensive, that I could purchase at my tobbaco shop in Towson, 
Maryland? I'm not sure which pipe tobacco to purchase there, so I was 
wondering if Mac Baren's Black Ambrosia Pipe Tobacco was any good.

Thanks, and keep up the good work with the digest.

[ I have a can of Black Ambrosia here, and it's gone largely unsmoked.
But that's just my taste.  It's a black Cavendish; probably if you
like Captain Black you'll like Black Ambrosia more. -S. ]

Steve, the PDs are getting better all the time, that is if you can improse
on success.I read #214 while smoking a half-bent GBD, and old one which a
friend gave me, and it is a beauty. What made it ever more enjoyable is
that it was filled with Craig Tarler's #813, which is to be my tobacco of
choice. I took advantage of his offer and selected five samples from his
extensive list, of which three were good, but 813 is the best. In over 55
years of smoking, I have tried many tobaccos and I recall the pleasure I
had smoking Revelation, but that was when I was young. I even tried Rum and
Maple then. But there was one tobacco I really enjoyed and that was S.S.
Pierce of Boston's OPM. They are long out of business, but I wonder if any
other tobacco firm ever took over that blend. I enjoy reading the posts of
these young fellows who have just experienced the joy of pipe smoking. I've
never known of a bad guy who was a pipe smoker, except perhaps for John
Mitchell. Cheers, Ben Frank

Dear Steve,
At the recent mention of the Tobacco Taverne in State College, PA, I thought
it would be a good idea to notify anyone in the area of the new cigar shop
in town. Its appropriately called "The Cigar Shop" and it's, in my opinion a
step up from the taverne.  The new place has a walk in humidor that's well
appointed and quite relaxing. The cigar selection is about equivalent to the 
taverne.  However the shop does not carry pipes or pipe tobacco.
thank you and keep up the good work,

	Steve,
	  After recieving this magazine I now realize I'm not the only 
young person that smokes a pipe.  I meet people all the time who can't 
believe I just don't smoke cigaretts instead but, I tell them a pipe is much 
more 
enjoyable and smells better too. I do have question though through my 
expirience I have discovered that pipe smoking does not seem to be as 
adictave as cigarett smoking I smoke alot somedays other days one or two 
bowls and yet other times I just plane don't feel like it. I love to 
smoke the pipe but, I have at times gone more than a week without even 
realizing I haden't smoked.  Is this just me or is pipe tobacco not as 
addictave as other tobbaco?

[ Never having been big on cigarettes, I couldn't say, Mark.  Though I
have little trouble putting it aside when I want. Probably the major
factor is that few people inhale pipes.  Some believe that pipe
tobacco contains less nicotine, though I don't know that

Steve and all,

        it's been a little while since i've updated the mailing list as to
what's been going on on the Web page.  here's some of the stuff:

        1) first and foremost, we now have our own domain!  thanks to the
ever-helpful Vince Calloway, the pipes home page is now located at:

        <a href="http://www.pipes.org/">http://www.pipes.org/</a>

pretty darn cool, i think.  the old address at www.tacoma.net will be
deprecated in the coming months, so update those pointers!  the new domain
may not have propagated to all corners of the world, but it's at least
reached my little corner of it.

        2) for people who have difficulty with background images (the
lettering seems very faint), try using <a href="http://www.pipes.org/no_bg_index.html">http://www.pipes.org/no_bg_index.html</a>
that should solve your problems.

        3) a new disclaimer has been added for pointers from the page;
please read it if you plan to submit a URL and are in the habit of sending
out junk email.

        4) old digests now have all email addresses stripped out of them;
see #3 for the reason why.

        there's also lots of new pointers and such, drop by and check things
out when you get a chance.

Steve, firstly, thanks for sending me your digest, it has proved useful and
informative as well as amusing.  I was wondering if you could include the
following in the next edition of the digest ...

     I am a 20 year old student currently studying at the University of
Huddersfield, England.  As part of my course, I am carrying out a survey of
pipe smokers, (being one myself, I felt this to be the perfect subject to
study).
     I was wondering there are any pipe smokers, preferably aged below 30,
although there isn't really a cut off point, that would be willing to answer 
a few questions regarding pipe smoking, such as when, where, how and why
they became a pipe smoker.  I f there are any willing volunteers could  you
please email me at the following address ...

               ????????@???.??.??

     possibly giving a brief outline of their answers.  Also, I would like
to hear any views from pipe smokers on how they feel about smoking a pipe in 
todays world,  in particular, how younger pipe smokers feel about their pipe 
smoking in a time when many view pipes as strictly for the older
generations.

     I would be most grateful for any information sent to me.

               Thanks,
               Nick Goldberg.

<a name="13">Subject: How It All Began</a>

Hi Steve, 
      
     How are you today ?  Thanks for the dedication to the Digest, I love
it.  I just thought I would give this a shot since I wanted to tell you how
I became interested in pipes and pipe smoking.  It is a rich history and I
hope it doesn't bore anyone. 
  
     Looking back on it now, at 35 years old I could say that ever since I
could remember, my Dad smoked a pipe.  My earliest memories are of him
smoking his pipe on a Sunday afternoon.  At about the age of 5, I used to
join my father for his ritual "Sunday Drive" in his 1960 Chevy Impala.  He
loved that car and I surmise that his ritual began long before I was.  One
of his rituals was smoking his pipe while taking that long drive on the
Long Island Expressway on a trip to nowhere.  You see, he worked two jobs
and even on Saturday, so he never used the car during the week.  He was a
firm believer in the idea that if you did not use the car much you should
take it on a long ride when the opportunity arrived.  I don't know the
validity of this idea but it worked for him.  So, after we got out of
church, as Mom cooked her marinara sauce at home, Dad and I would embark on
a trip to really, nowhere.  We would just drive for about an hour and then
turn around and head back.  I think he just loved the idea that he could
"get away" for a bit and smoke his pipe and drive his car.  I can still
picture him sitting behind the wheel, smoking his pipe filled with Holiday
Tobacco, the aroma of the tobacco blowing around me in the passenger seat,
it smelled great.  I loved that time we spent together, actually for two
reasons; I didn't get to see much of him during the week and I loved the
smell of his pipe.   
 
     As for his collection, he had about three circular racks of twelve
with the glass humidor in the middle.  One humidor lid even had two horses
heads carved out of the wood.  The racks were filled with various pipes.  I
don't believe he owned any that would be considered a high grade.  He must
have bought them anywhere from the late 1950's to early 1960's.  I don't
remember him ever buying a pipe during the times that I could remember.  I
remember many with a with shamrock logo, others were from E.A. Carey's as I
would come to know later on.  As for the humidors, they were always filled
with Holiday or, later, Capt. Black.  He smoked these blends exclusively.
He was content with his modest collection and along with some pipe cleaners
and a pipe tool, he was happy. 
 
     These are my earliest memories of pipe smoking and I think it laid the
foundation to my own passion that followed in my adult life.  I would say
that life went on pretty much the same until my teen years, when teens try
to detach themselves from their parents and establish their own identities.
 The Sunday drives continued for my dad but unfortunately, without me.  At
the age of fifteen, I got bold.  I would go downstairs to the basement to
the shelves where my father's pipes were, select one that appealed to me,
fill it with Holiday and then go to the back door, light up and blow the
smoke into the alley behind the house.  This went on for a while and I
enjoyed it.  Once, I asked my mother when she thought it would be
appropriate for me to take up the pipe and she said, "When you get a little
older, Louis".  As far as I was concerned, that wasn't a "no", so at the
age of sixteen I was able to scrape up $15.00  and with that I went down to
Arnold's Tobacco Shop located in Queens Center Mall and purchased my first
pipe, an Italian second.  To me, it was the greatest pipe I had ever seen. 
Though it was loaded with fills, it was my own.  So, with that, a couple of
ounces of an aromatic called "Cake Box", some new pipe cleaners and a brand
spankin' new three in one pipe tool, I was well on my way into the world of
Kapnismology.  Kinda' weird to be smoking a pipe at the age of sixteen.  I
was the only one of my friends to do so.  Everyone else smoked cigarettes,
but I loved it.  Even more to my delight was to find out that the Hobbits
loved to smoke pipes.  That's right, I found my way to some great reading
by Tolkein and could not believe that the Hobbits smoked pipes.  This was
great, I would light up in my room, open a window and read The Lord of the
Rings into the night.  At sixteen this was heavy duty.  It was around this
time that I met my good friend Fred Alvarez.  We met at a teen club that
was held in my old grammar school in Middle Village.  We shared similar
interests and started hanging out.  You would not believe this but Fred,
who was two years older, also happened to be a pipe smoker.  He smoked
cigarettes too but he loved his pipe.  We could not believe this.  There
was nobody our age who smoked pipes.  So, we shared tobacco and how to's on
pipe smoking. 
    Things went on like this for some time.  I was in high school and
didn't work so new pipes didn't come by so easy.  I managed to obtain a few
more pipes from Arnold's, nothing to mention but I loved all of them, about
five in all.  Years passed all the while smoking when I could, through high
school and college.  Never met anyone else who enjoyed the pipe beside
Fred, even at Queens College.  He too obtained a few non descript pipes for
his collection.  Once I did start working, at Maspeth Federal S &amp; L Assoc. 
things picked up.  I remember going to Arnold's one day and I bought my
first meerschaum.  It was the head of a Viking.  I am a Minnesota Viking
fan so this pipe was a must buy.  It was carved by Yunis, have you heard of
him ?  It is a beautiful pipe.  Colored great in ten years of on off
smoking.  Also around this time, 1985, I received a catalog from Wally
Frank, since their main distributor/warehouse was located in the
neighboring town of Middle Village, I lived in Maspeth.  BTW, Wally Frank
is now somebody else and are located in Texas.  I also received a catalog
from E.A. Carey's, a company I remember seeing on the shanks of some of my
father's pipes.  He BTW, still smoked his pipes throughout these years as
well.  He didn't seem too interested when I told him I started smoking
pipes and he was not the talkative type.  Anyway, I bought some pipes from
both of these companies, turned Fred on to their phone numbers and the both
of us started to amass a collection.  I bought some Savinelli's, some GBD's
and some tobaccos.  At this time I also started seeking out tobacconists in
the area.  Besides Arnold's in Queens Center Mall, the only place to find
tobacconists was Manhattan, so I visited Pipeworks at Wilke, De La Concha,
Arnold's Manhattan and Barclay Rex.  There was a Wally Frank's store in
Roosevelt Field Mall were I bought a few pipes like Micloi, Butz-Chocin and
some seconds as well as tobacco and supplies.  But it was the Manhattan
stores that I got my first look at "high grades".  WOW !!!  Pipes like
Dunhill, Ashton, Jacapo, Peterson,  etc...  All out of my range for sure. 
However, one day in the mail I struck gold.  I was somehow, by the magic of
mailing lists, found by the late Barry Levin of then Levin Pipes.  BINGO,
he sold pipes that were already smoked, sounded gross but could you believe
those prices !!!  Now I could conceivably afford the high grades that I
could only drool over in the stores.  So it was that I began my second life
in Kapnismology.  Of course, Fred learned of Barry Levin also.  I bought as
many pipes as I could afford and even when I couldn't.  I amassed a great
collection of assorted brands and artisans.  I also learned of Hacker's
book, The Ultimate Pipe Book, and an instant "ultimate" education ensued. 
Other mailers followed like Bob Hamlin of Pipe Collectors Club of America,
Edwards Tobacco Shop and others.  I also had the privelage, via Hacker's
book, of finding out about Tom Dunn and the Pipe Smokers Ephemeris, who, by
this publication has done more for our hobby in the last 30+ years than
anyone.  By it I have received countless amounts of information to feed my
passion.  So, over the last seven to ten years I have delved deeply into
the fine art of pipe smoking.  I have attended all of the N.Y. Pipe Club
Shows, four in all, and have met a great number of fine fellows and
friends.  A sad note to all of this was finding out about the passing of
Barry Levin when I attended the Second Annual N.Y. Pipe Show.  It was
sudden and tragic and it sent a shock wave throughout the world of pipe
smoking.  I have him to thank for teaching me the finer points and the
refinements of our hobby.  If anything positive could have come out of his
passing, it was that his son Nikos Levin emerged  to carry on what his
father had begun, the distribution of and EDUCATION about fine pipes,
tobaccos and assesories.  He is one of the finer gentlemen that I have had
the privelage to meet and get to know.   
 
     As for the state of my pipe smoking today, I basically deal with
either Nikos Levin or Bob Hamlin as others delete me from their list if I
fail to buy a pipe per mailer.  Now I realize that these mailers cost a
great deal of money, but if we fail to receive them, how will we have the
opportunity to buy.  I realize and understand their position, though. 
However at this point in my life, married with two children, it is often
times difficult to justify the purchase of a new Ashton or Jacapo when the
cupboard is bare, you know what I mean ?  But given the opportunity, I
would be able to purchase a pipe here and there if the mailer was to reach
me on occasion.  Here I must make a good point.  I must say that if you can
find a local tobacconist, and I mean tobacconist, he/she is overwhelmingly
deserving of our support.  My "local" tobacconist happens to be located
about 20 miles from my house but he has my support.  I am speaking of one
of the kindest friends I also have the privelage of knowing and that is Joe
Nastri of Trinity East Tobacco Shop located on the Sunrise Highway in
Rockville Center, Long Island.  He is "the" premier tobacconist this side
of the East River.  He will never fail to go out of his way to help you
find just the right pipe and tobacco.  Too many shops are closing their
doors and it seems that the tobacconist is a dying breed.  This is a shame.
 We can prevent it by supporting our local tobacconist.  Getting back to my
likes, I smoke either English blends of assorted kinds and Tinned Virginias
and Matured Virginias, the kind that McClelland's puts out.  My Favorite
pipes are whatever catches my eye as my collection is diversified with many
different brands and artisans.  I must say that I smoke exclusively bents
or semi-bents as I really don't think I am comfortable with straight pipes.
 My favorite pipes would be those made in England; Ashton and Dunhill and
Italy; Castello, Radice, Jacapo, and old Caminetto's, but I will smoke any
and all in between.  As long as the pipe has no fills and I like what it
looks like I would consider adding it to my collection.  I have about 60
pipes of Briar and Meerschaum.        
 
     So, basically this is my pipe story take it or leave it.  I hope that
some can relate and I hope it didn't bore anyone, sorry if it did.  I smoke
about a pipeful a day during the week and about two to three on Sat. and
Sun.  My friend Fred still enjoys his pipes as well and we enjoy chatting
about our experiences with them.  I try to stay as informed as I could and
the Pipes Digest is one of the best ways of doing that.  In a non
electronic form, the Pipe Smokers Ephemeris by Tom Dunn is my other link. 
I applaud all of the efforts of people like you and Tom for the task is
colossal.  But it is people like you who keep the torch lit by providing a
forum for us to share our knowledge, ask questions and learn.  A most noble
effort for sure. 
 
     So, Steve, I hope you enjoyed a look into my world. If you can I would
appreciate if you could post it to the digest.  Also please post my new
e-mail address if you would.  I'll speak to you soon, until then, stay well
and happy smoking. 
 
Your friend , 
 
Louis F. Carbone             

[ You're absolutely right about supporting your local tobacconist,

Steve,
	Thank you for adding me to the digest.  I am twenty years old and 
am really just stating to really get into pipe smoking.  I have 
experimented off and on with pipe smoking for about six months now.  I 
really enjoy it but like other members of the digest whom are my age I 
have found that it is not looked upon as "Normal".  For the past six 
months I have been attempting to avoid most people when I smoke.  
(Especially family, they wouldn't approve...) So I was wondering if you 
know of any pipe (Or Cigar) clubs in the Aurora, IL area.  If not are 
there any members of the digest from that area interested in getting 
together to enjoy a bowl?

Steve,

two business notes:
1)  I attended the Chicago Pipe Show 2 weekends ago.  It was wonderful!
It was my first show and I had a great time.  Also, I purchased a Tilshead
pipe by Upshaw and some English tobacco.  I love them both!!

2)  I have a pipe my father smoked in college and it is very unique.  It is
a billard style with grooves carved into it.  Also, it has a yellow dot on
the shank on the left side.  If you know, can you help me find out what it
is.  Can anyone help me?

Thanks,
Brandon Rottinghaus

You can sometimes steam out small dents using a wet cloth or sock and and a
warm iron. He says to iron the briar with the cloth inbetween, being careful,
of course, not to scortch the briar or yourself.

[ Polishing the pipe afterward, once it has cooled and dried, probably
couldn't hurt either.  See below for another dent-removal

A gentleman wrote asking how to remove dents from briar bowls.  Since I am
not very good at this internet stuff yet, I am posting a reply to you
instead of the person asking the question.  It is really a quite easy
process, requiring only some paper towels, an iron (like you press clothes
with), and some water.  Tear a paper towel in half, and fold it continuously
until it is a square, about 2 inches large.  Then dampen the towel with
water.  Place the towel on the dent, and place the iron on the towel.  Do
this repeatedly until the dent "pops" out.  I have done this many times over
the years, and in some cases actually fixed some dents in which the wood
fibres were broken or crushed.  I performed this feat on a patent date
Dunhill root briar some years ago, and the repair was invisible.  While you
are doing the steaming, continue checking to make sure you do not scorch the
wood.  Continue wetting the paper towel so it does not dry out.  Any more
questions, drop me a message.

Steve,
Good Morning!
 I am sitting down getting ready to try my first pipe of Stoneheaven 
from Esoterica. It's deep, rich aroma is very excellent. This leads  me 
to my question. As I am still relatively new to pipe smoking I was 
wondering if you could point me towards some good reading/primers on 
pipe tobacco and the various kinds/descriptions, such as what 
characterizes a Virgina, a burley, etc..
 I am afraid that when my favorite tobacconist here in Columbus starts 
talking about the blends I get a little lost. I know what I like, but 
not much more than that. 
Any help would be REALLY appreciated.
Thanks

<a name="19">Subject: Condor etc.</a>

Dear Steve, 

I noticed a member wrote that Grant's in San Francisco was an enjoyable stop
for visitors of that fair city. Grants is what I would call a real
tobacconist.  I was in Grant's just the other day and what should I find but
a package of Condor light blend.  I had read so much about it that I added it
to my other purchases.  I know that Grants used to mail order perhaps this is
a source of the much sought after brand.

 Smoking the Condor later on that day was a very nice experience, one I would
have never had without the comraderie of this group. I was reflecting on what
 another contributor had written on the very real difference PD has made to
the  enjoyment of this hobby.

 I started smoking a pipe a couple years ago and was aided on my journey by
the very friendly advice of Jay Beardsly of Edwards Pipes in Los Altos.
(Origonally part of the other Edwards stores but since an independent)
Everyone should try to find at least one  tobacconist, if they are fortunate
enough to have one nearby,  where you know the proprieter on a first name
basis.  Even with, what I think, was better tutoring in the art of pipe
smoking than most people without local tobacconists get, I don't think that I
would be half as knowledgable with out this great forum. Its like having the
most knowledgable pipe smokers in the whole country available at my own
 corner smoke shop. 

I have now purchased estate pipes now from Pulvers Prior Briar, Nikos Levin,
Edwards, Briar Nut and Old Knickerbockers as well as attending the Southwest
Pipe show last June. I have found that I like  virginias (throat can't handle
latakia unfortunately) currently my favorite is Three Nuns and I am always
searching for the perfect blend. One of the gentlemen I met at the Briar Nut
in Hayward, who had been a pipe afficianado for 25 years, told me he felt one
of the joys of the pipe was searching for the perfect tobacco which he knew
he probably would never find but always hoped and believed he might.  The
search for perfection without making too much fuss about it and having a good
time along the way, what a great philosophy to live by.  

Thanks Steve ,  I like PD just the way it is.

[ Thank you, John!  BTW, I was lucky enough to acquire a few pouches
of Condor in a trade from Bruce Harris.  Personally, I'm not crazy
about it; it has probably the heaviest concentration of glycol I've
ever encountered.  Other than that, it was (probably) a nice mild
flake; the "light" variety may be different. Anyone know of a way of
de-glycoling tobacco?  -S. ]

Steve,
  Thanks for all the hard work you put into this digest.  It's really
been both a joy and a help to read.  Could you change my mailing
address from ????????@???????.??? to ????????@???.???.  I'm trying to
stem the flow of email at work.  I'll just have to learn to tolerate
the aoler jabs from some of the other news groups.

  My name is Dan Stegner, I've been an off-and-on-again pipe smoker
for several years, trying to get rid of the cigarette habit.  I've
been mostly smoking my pipe for the past year or so.  English blends
are my favorite for late afternoon and evening. In the morning I'll
smoke IQ, St Bruno's Flake, or Dark Navy Twist--depending on my mood.

  I try to buy the best pipes that I can afford.  I have a couple of
meerchims, a Norde freehand (the cheap ones), an Ardore full bent
which is a nice dry smoke, a Savinelli Long John, and a Stanwell.  The
Stanwell and Savinelli are recent additions during my sudden and
ongoing estate pipe craze.  I recently bought a never-smoked pipe that
was collecting dust at a grocery store for $20.  The briar has lots of
beutiful birds-eye and there are no putty fills that I can see.  The
briar is stained, but not varnished or laquered and it provides a
wonderful smoke. The brand name is Wild Honey and it is made in
London, England.  My local tobacconist said that this brand is no
longer made, but that's all he could tell me about the pipe.

  Can anyone provide me with more information about Wild Honey pipes?
I couldn't find any reference in Hacker's book and a search of back
issues of the digest proved fruitless.

Thanks,
Dan Stegner

<a name="23">Subject: Pipes Digest</a>

Steve --

I noticed some commentaries recently on Perique and Latakia on the "net."
I pulled out of my desk drawer a newspaper article that appeared in the
New Orleans paper a few years ago, concerning Perique farming in
Louisiana.  Perhaps the readers might be interested in some excerpted
tidbits therefrom........

Today, Perique is grown in a sandy location, less than one hour's drive
from New Orleans.  Many pipesmokers know the story, how the French settlers
got seeds and curing techniques from the Native Americans here, so I
won't belabor that part of the history.

The processing of Perique is still largely a "hands-on" operation.  Each
tobacco leaf is handled 15-20 times before it is squeezed into a barrel and
pressed repeatedly with a screw-jack during curing.  The seeds are planted
Then, in June, when the mature leaf turns yellowish, the stalks are cut
with cane knives; and the plants are left until the next morning, while
turning limp in texture.  Then, the stalks are hung in a barn to dry, after
which the leaves are stripped off and pounded.  After beating, the leaves 
are moistened and hand-stemmed, in preparation for the pressing and curing.

The local folks sometimes chew it and smoke it in cigarettes (as well as
pipes -- WARNING!  To the uninitiated, smoking straight Perique will really
clear the sinuses!)  The dust from the tobacco-pounding is also popular
locally for keeping lice and fleas from chicken houses and dog houses.

Sadly, Perique production has dramatically dropped in recent decades.
It is becoming harder and harder to get the present generation of local
folks to pursue this toil and hands-on work.  There are few "brokerage
houses" left in the area.  One is Poche's.  For anyone travelling to the
New Orleans area (with a car), you can get there by taking I-20 west
toward Baton Rouge.  Exit at Highway 641 and proceed south to Highway 44
(River Road).  Go upriver from the town of Lutcher, about 10 miles.
Poche's is on the right, just past Manresa House of Retreats.  There are
no organized tours, but Poche's is usually open for a visit.

Perique is definitely on the "enddangered species" list.  Enjoy it.

A year or so ago, I found (in a small art shop in the French Quarter)
a print of the Perique farmers in the act of twisting the wooden
scre-jacks, pressing the large "carottes" of tobacco leaf in the 
large curing barrels, as it slowly aged (fermented) in its juices.
It adorns my office wall now (and, no, it's not for sale!).

Puff, puff,
Rick Welch

[ Indeed!  If you enjoy Perique, it might be best to stock up on some
tinned varieties now; recos are solicited. -S. ]

Here's another little thing I came across rereading Baudelaire's _Les 
Fleurs du Mal_ (which seems to go better with a cigar than a pipe, 
IMO):

The Pipe

I am a writer's pipe.  One look at me
and the coffee color of my Kaffir face
will tell you I am not the only slave:
my master is addicted to his vice.

Every so often he is overcome
by some despair or other, whereupon
tobacco clouds pour out of me as if
the stove were kindled and the pot put on.

I wrap his soul in mine and cradle it
within a blue and fluctuating thread
that rises out of my rekinsled lips

from the glowing coal that brews a secret spell.
He smokes his pipe, allaying heart and mind,
and for tonight all injuries are healed.

&gt;&gt;When breaking in a new pipe is it normal for even the nicest of tobacco to

&gt;&gt;deal of trouble or rather distaste with it! Is there anyone who can shed 
&gt;&gt;any light on this topic?

&gt;No. as a matter of fact just the opposite.  NO past tobacco to chg the taste. 
&gt;I have had problems keeping new pipes lit, but not in the tobacco
&gt;tasting bad. Have you tried several tobaccos?

Thank you for such a speedy reply! I have only tried two blends in it, which
are very similar. Both blends are quite sweet and very aromatic. In an old
pipe the are both excellent, but in the Peterson are quite different. I have
smoked 6-8 half bowls of the Peterson with these blends but I cannot seem to
get right to the bottom becavse the tobacco becomes too juict and
distasteful. Needles to say, the bottom of the bowl is not black yet.
Perhaps I am being too impetuous and want too much from the Peterson too soon?

Best Regards, 

Jason Gallop

[ The P-trap system also has a tendency to get juicy, regardless of
how well the pipe is broken in.  This might be affecting the flavor. I
also find that my larger Petersons generally smoke better than the
small ones.

But regardless of size, the best results are obtained by cleaning the
traps regularly with a paper towel or Q-tip soaked in pipe sweetner or
Everclear (grain alcohol). Petersons are made for convenience, but
they must be cared for. -S. ]

The BBC is located at El Camino and Santa Cruz, in Menlo Park (right
next to Kepplers Books).

The meeting will either be inside and upstairs, or outside, depending
on weather and the preferences of those who show up.

The PPC is an informal organization that has no charter, officers,
agenda, or dues. Just good fellowship, useful information, stimulating
pipe and tobacco discussion, and the occasional pipe trade. Plus, the
BBC will be happy to sell you a beer.

(the FIRST MEETING is May 5. I have no idea how many people will show
up)

Hi Steve,
Enrico speaking, from Italy.
I've got a question for you (and for all the other readers, of course):
Few days ago I've been given by a friend of mine some very very old tobacco.
There are three different types,two of them contained in a pouch and the other 
in a metal box. They should be about 10 or 12 years old. Since this kinds of
tobacco are totally new to me, I would like to try to smoke them even if
they are very dry. What would you suggest me to make them "smokable" again ??

If you want to include this message in the next PD, it's o.k., but if you
have a personal answer, please send it to me before, if it's possible.

I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING THEM !!!!

Thank you very very very much ....

Bye, bye ...

Enrico Schiattarella &lt;??????????????@?????.??&gt;

[ Try the following: Make a concentrated solution of salt water.  Seal
the old tobacco in an airtight container with the salt water. The salt
water should not touch the tobacco. Wait a few weeks.

If that doesn't work, dip your fingers into some fresh water and
sprinkle a little on the tobacco.  Seal it in an airtight container.
Wait a few days and repeat as needed. Be very careful not to crumble
the tobacco. -S. ]

[ADMIN] Our illustrious Webmaster, Steve Beaty, has done it again!
For folks without Usenet access, the Digest Web page now provides
recent articles on the alt.smokers.pipes newsgroup.  Look for it in:

	     <a href="http://www.pipes.org/News/alt/smokers/pipes/">http://www.pipes.org/News/alt/smokers/pipes/</a>

See his letter next.  Steve, may you never lack Latakia, may your
Perique always be at its peak, and may your Burley never get surly!

This has got me thinking... one of these days, I'll have to go over
the back issues and make a collection of all the tobacconian toasts.
There are others lurking in this issue!

[CIGARS,BOSNIA] And don't forget about Operation Cigar Lift, as
mentioned in Pipes Digest #215.  This is an effort to solicit
donations of cigars for U.S. servicemen stationed in Bosnia.  Full
details can be found at <a href="http://www.cigar.com/airlift/">http://www.cigar.com/airlift/</a> or by writing to
Jim Denton (???????@?????.???).  I'm sure that Captain Rupp and his
men will appreciate anything you can do, as we appreciate what they're
doing for us!

Steve,

&gt; Hence the changes to the Digest format (removing the new members'
&gt; addresses) and also to the Web site (removing _all_ addresses from
&gt; archived Digests), to protect Digest members from junk mail.
Steve,

I do understand the need to privatize email addresses; it seems the 
only prudent course of action.  Nevertheless, I did derive a significant 
amount of enjoyment from seeing the various geographic locations of new 
readers. If the address-stripping is being done by software, would it be 
possible to alter it to strip out the addresses while leaving the 
domain/location info?

	On another topic, I have been looking for carrying cases

Does anyone know where I could find a case for larger pipes? Everything I

<a name="9">Subject: Goodby</a>

	First I want to thank you for the excellent job you do with the 
Pipes Digest. I have looked forward to every issue.
	I'm a 19 year old college student, who became a pipe smoker quite
by accident. I was cruising the net early one morning and happened across
a pipe smoking page. The thought of smoking a pipe seemed like a good
idea. About a week later I purchased a relatively nice briar from a flea
market, and a nice vanilla blend from (as far as I know) the only tobacco
store in town. I enjoy smoking very much, although I don't get to do it 
as much as I would like due to time restraints and the ever present "NO 
SMOKING" sign.
	It is with great sadness then, that I must ask you to remove my
address from the mailing list. My first year of college is done here, and 
I will no longer have access to the schools computer after this week. If 
I can I will try to get a new accout, sometime at a later date. Until 
then, goodby.

					Thank you,
						Randy Summers

tobaccos. They also sell cigars, although I don't know what kind or how 
many (beacuse I wasn't looking). Your welcome to post as much or as 
little of this letter as you like. Thanks again.

<a name="11">Subject: First Smoking Experience</a>

Steve:
     I thought you might get a kick out of my first pipe smoking 
incident. A friend and I decided to start smoking the pipe...we already 
were smoking cigars...so we set aside the money and went to the smoke 
shop. We entered the Tinder Box and said we wanted to be set up with a 
pipe outfit..I must add that they were very helpful in getting us 
started. So we went straight to our usual smoking spot...on a beach on 
Lake Erie...and we pulled out the directions, yes written directions! We 
followed them to the tee and then we tried to lite them. I must add that 
neither one of us wanted anyone to see us make fools out of our selves 
trying to do this so we hid behind a shed. I think we must of looked like 
a couple of crack heads because every one who walked by gawked at us. 
Well we finally got it lit and the rest is history. We're 
youngin's...early 20's...and I find that the pipe really relieves the 
typical college stress. We've been smoking for about a ear now and slowly 
building our pipe collections. This is one of the interesting hobbies I 
have picked up. Pleasant smoking!
-Steve

[ Thanks for the note, Steve!  At least you had directions; I had to
go through a book of matches trying to keep that first bowl lit! -S. ]

<a name="12">Subject: Thanks to all for Bonfiglioli opinions</a>

&lt;sent to _Pipes Digest_ and posted to a.s.p.&gt;

To all who responded to my call for opinions regarding Bonfiglioli
pipes (and all other interested parties):
Thank you all for the input and recommendations.  Upon the strength of
these, I ordered three pipes from Alberto - the OoOPS pipe (a short,
thick-walled pot), a bent billiard, and an apple (I like traditional
shapes).  There may have been some miscommunication, so I may be
getting one more pipe than I actually ordered.  Oh well, I'll buy it
anyhow...
I received the OoOPS pipe on 27 April, and I must say that it exceeded
my (high, from what I'd heard) expectations.  Beautiful wood, nice
finish, and a good hand-filling shape.  It smokes better than either
of my Petersons, my Savinelli, or the Upshall I bought in a moment of
justifiable (and thankfully temporary) insanity - and it's not even
broken in yet!
I expect to be doing more business with Signor Bonfiglioli in the
future.

May the Leaf be with you always,
Chuck

<a name="13">Subject: Pipes Digest Submission</a>

Greetings Steve and esteemed Pipes Digest readers.

I've been a subscriber to the list for a short time only and have a few
ponderings some of you may be able to help me with.  First let me say thanks
to Steve and every member of the Pipes Digest for providing such an
interesting, uncluttered and informative format for sharing information on
pipe smoking.

In a throwback to the early days of the digest, I'll give an introduction of
myself and how I took to the pipe, prior to boring you with my silly
questions...

I'm 35, have only been smoking a pipe for a few months now and have really
gotten the hang of it.  As with many hobbies an interests I've acquired
throughout my life, pipe smoking is one I wish I had "discovered" a long
time ago.  I got started into the world of pipe smoking when I stopped by a
local tobacco shop to buy a couple of cigars for a friend and I to enjoy on a
weekend get together.  We like to try a cigar now and then, and we were
feeling the craving about that time.  In visiting tobacco shops over the
years, the pipe tobaccos always intrigued me.  They smelled so incredible
and I always kept in the back of my mind the thought of trying a pipe
someday. On this particular visit, I started asking pipe questions of the
shop personnel.

With my interest running high, I came back home and did a little snooping
here on the net for pipe smoking information.  I found the alt.smokers.pipes
newsgroup along with the various web pages and of course this wonderful Pipes
Digest.  After reading the Pipes Digest FAQ and after posting an inquiry to
the a.s.p newsgroup, several readers who responded gave me some helpful
pointers.  With knowledge in hand, I went back to the tobacco shop and
purchased in inexpensive bent pipe with a couple of samples of cavendish
tobacco.

While the tobacco wasn't bad, it simply didn't taste nearly as good as it
smelled in the pouch.  My first few tries at smoking the pipe were pretty
much to be as expected... very hot pipe (smoking *way* to fast), lots of
gurgling, lots of doddle and difficulty in keeping the tobacco lit.  All
this left me a little disappointed and wondering if I should bother to
continue.

Then, with guidance received from the readers of a.s.p and the regulars of
the #pipes IRC channel on irc.dal.net, I ordered an Edward's Royce Canonball
style pipe via mailorder from the Ft. Collins, CO store.  What a wonderful
change for the positive having a *real* pipe and tobacco without glycol
casing was in my smoking struggle!  But I still found the cavendish samples I
was acquiring and trying sort of boring and lacking in the strength of taste
I was craving.  What happened next has converted me to a pipe smoker for
life... Bruce Beaman, a #pipes channel regular, sent me a small sample of a
tobacco called Blatter Reserve from Blatter &amp; Blatter Co. in Montreal,
Quebec.  It was love at first light!  I then learned first hand what an
English blend is.  The rest is becoming history.  I've been sampling various
English blends from Cornell &amp; Diehl and continue to find these blends are
the style that I like.  I still try a cavendish now and then, but the English
blends keep my taste buds happy.

In this short period I've purchased another quality pipe to rotate between
(I've been spoiled can't bring myself to smoke the el cheapo pipe ever
again), and I can see that I need even more pipes for my various smoking
schemes... one exclusively for my favorite tobacco (Blatter Reserve)... one
for sampling my English blends... one for sampling cavendishes... one for...
well you get the idea.  There's always a reason for a new pipe!

On the other hand, many of my friends and co-workers think I've gone insane
and are sure there must be something else they're not seeing in my pipe...
like some illegal additive in the tobacco!  One co-worker has seen the light
and actually joined me.  He ordered himself an Edward's pipe via mailorder
also.  My wife is just getting over the shock of my new "interest" also.
She's convinced I'll be starting with a pipe and will end up lying in the
gutter chain smoking cigarettes.  I tried cigarettes in high school and
thought the taste was disgusting, not to mention my wondering about the
questionable intelligence of inhaling concentrated pollution into one's
lungs.  I do not inhale pipe smoke.  My employer has a no smoking policy, so
I now get to join the cigarette smokers outside.  It's rather lonely... they
(the cigarette smokers) run outside, light up and polish off a stick in 5
minutes and dash off back inside.  I'm just finished lighting my pipe and
starting to enjoy myself when they're finished and gone!  But I really love
relaxing and smoking my pipe... fellowship or not!

I'm now looking forward to trying to carve a few pipes for myself.  Thanks to
the information in the Pipes Digest, I called Stemco-Pimo and received a pipe
carving supply catalog.

All that being said, here are the questions for you pipe gurus...

1.  What exactly is technique used to "rub out" tobacco?  If this literally 
means you rub the tobacco between the palms of your hands, won't it make a 
big mess?  Is thins done in a big container before putting in your pouch?

2.  Many of the cavendish tobaccos I've tried impart a stinging or bitter
sensation on the back of my tongue and throat, especially when smoked
heavily.  Which tobacco leaf actually causes this effect?  I suspect maybe
some sort of Virginia tobacco, because some of the blends which exhibit this
boast flavorings with a Virginia base.  The Blatter Reserve I like so much
gives no such problem.  Blatter Reserve is a very dark color... does this
mean it lacks Virginia?  I don't like this "peppery" sensation and would like
to know which tobacco I need steer clear of to avoid it.

3.  I've successfully polished my Vulcanite stems with a muslin buffing 
wheel mounted to my 6" bench grinder and tripoli compound.  Is it acceptable 
to polish the briar in this same manner?

Well, thanks all for your advice.

May your tobacco stay fresh and your pipe stay warm!

John

[ To rub out tobacco, place about one bowlful in the palm of one hand
and rub it between the thumb and forefinger of the other, until it is
loose and springy.  What you don't put in the bowl can go back in the
pouch, but I think it stays fresher if you only rub out what you're
going to smoke at the time.

And lastly, your polishing technique sounds pretty much correct for
briar, though you might want to follow the tripoli with some white
diamond, and finish with carnauba wax.  BTW, on stems, use a light
touch; it's easy to gouge them, as I've found through bitter
experience! I don't think the type of tobacco has as much to do with bite as its
proper humidity, its packing in the bowl, and your smoking style.  Pay
attention to these and you'll learn the fine points.  To some extent,
other substances might make a bite worse (for me, these include mint
toothpaste or vinegar) or lessen the chance of getting bitten (sweet
drinks like wine or iced tea seem to help.)  I'd also advise you never
to smoke with a bitten tongue.  

Also see the next article re bite; it's very interesting! -S. ]

<a name="14">Subject: Tongue Bite</a>

Illustrious Moderator and Fellow Pipe Types:
    I recently came across a small book by a gentleman named Robert F. 
Winans entitled _The Pipe Smoker's Tobacco Book_ (Graphics Etc, Inc., 
Provincetown, Mass., 1977), and some interesting comments regarding the 
cause of tongue bite were made.  Winans reproduces a graph from an 
article by a Dr. Braun in _Beitrage zur Tobakforschung_, v.4, pp. 32-79 
(1967), and elaborates thus:
    "The graph is a temperature profile of the smoke at a point 
approximately 2 1/6 inches behind the pipe bowl.  A smoking machine was 
used to smoke the pipe."  The graph caption indicates that the machine 
made 6 puffs per minute of 2 second duration, that the volume of the 
draw was 20 ml, and the total smoking time was 28 minutes.  Winans 
continues:
    "Note that the temperature range in this experiment ranges from 
roughly 85F to 118F maximum and the highest temperature is of short 
duration towards the end of the smoke.  To equate this temperature to 
discomfort, or tongue bite, if coffee were served to you at this 
temperature you could gulp it down without hesitation and then complain 
about being served tepid coffee."
    "In other tests run in the U.S., temperature profiles were reported 
in which people did the smoking rather than a machine.  On the overall 
(sic) the results were not very different from the machine.  
experienced and inexperienced pipe smokers participated.  Different 
blends of tobaccos and new and broken-in pipes were used.  Following 
are some general comments on these tests:"
    The most interesting of these comments reads:
    "Based on the foregoing data it appears certain that tongue bite is 
not caused by high temperature.  Nor can we blame the pipe itself for 
delivering a hot smoke.  Knowing this we have to turn to the chemistry 
of the smoke for an answer.  Along with the chemistry of the smoke, the 
smoking habits of the pipe smoker must be taken into account."
(This is indented as a quotation in the text, but the source is not 
noted.  Winans provides a bibliography, but I haven't the time to look 
this up.)
Later:
    "The peppery sensation most often called tongue bite is in part due 
to the alkalinity of the smoke.  Pipe and cigar smoke, because they are 
alkaline, is the reason most smokers don't inhale this smoke."

Anyone else have any thoughts on this?
May the Leaf be with you always, 
Chuck

[ If so, then perhaps an acid drink might neutralize the bite... but
this is counter to my own experience! -S. ]

confussion with the next one:

Gimeno
La Rambla, 100
08002 Barcelona
Tel +34 3 302 09 83

Yes, there are TWO pipe shops named Gimeno in Barcelona, but they have
nothing to do between them.. Would you please include this second one in the
guide Steve ?

Besides that, the Barcelona Pipe Club has opened a WWW page:

<a href="http://www.barnaocio.es/pipa/index.html">http://www.barnaocio.es/pipa/index.html</a>

At the moment it's not very good, but it's just a first version, and will
improve soon.

Thanks Steve, and keep the good work.

Greetings.
It's been a while since I have contributed so I thought I might take this
rare and quiet moment to do so. Allow me to fill your mental briar with two
quick thoughts.
1)  I have found that a small container of coarsely ground fresh coffee beans
( espresso blend is good- I prefer a sumatran bean ) makes my inexpensive
humidor smell delightful and has helped overcome both lingering varnish odors
and a spell of nasty pipe tobacco that once resided therein.
2)  I  seem to recall one of the tobacco companies attempting to appease the
' your giving my child lung cancer with your second hand smoke' coalition by
producing a smoke-free cigarette. Hopes were quickly dashed when one
government agency or another nixed the wole idea by proclaiming that a
smokeless cigarette was, in fact, nothing more than a nicotine transferal
device ( requiring a presciption to use ? ). It is with some surprise then
that, on a recent trip to the local apothecary, I found myself standing
before an impressive counter display that informed me I too could now get
nicotine gum and patches with NO PRESCRIPTION! Really now, who's fooling who?
 We can infer from this that the pharmecutical lobby is now more powerful
than the tobacco lobby. Thanks for looking out for my 'best interests'
Washington D.C. but i think if I can be trusted not to overdose on Tagamet
and Orudis and a whole host of what were, until recently, prescription
medicines- I can be trusted to excercise moderation in smoking cigars.
Keep up the good fight Steve ( and tell Marvin we like his new humidor ;-)
Gideon Hill.  

[We remember the "smokeless cigarette" flap too; thanks for pointing
this little gem of logic out!  Sorry, but I have no connection with
Marvin Shanken, other than buying his magazine, so I couldn't presume
to tell him anything about Kennedy's humidor (though for US$600,000,
it should darn well transform any White Owl into a pre-CA Cohiba,
complete with band and Cubatabaco tax stamp! :-) -S. ]

In regard to your inquiry  about Wild Honey Pipes, I think I have some
information. Wild Honey Pipes were distributed by a small company in NJ
that sells a line of cheap pipes, candy, tobacco ,&amp; you name it,at the RTDA
show. I don t know if they are still in business. I doubt very much they
made them. Rather bought from the cheapest source and had their name
stamped on. I purchased one of these pipes as I too was struck by how clean
the pipe was and how good a cross grain it had. Unfortunately , it never
lived up to my expectations and has languished on my pipe rack . Mark

Dear Steve:

As the editor of SMOKESHOP magazine, I was surprised to find our listing in
the Pipe Digest Resource Guide is almost two years out of date! (Shame on me
for not checking sooner...)

Our magazine, which reaches nearly 4,000 specialty tobacco retailers as well
as industry leaders, is in its 26th year. It was purchased in August 1994,
and is bigger and better than ever. Recently we were named an official
publication of the industry's leading trade association, the RTDA (more on
that below!)

<a name="23">Subject:       Re: Submission #2 - Coumarin in Pipe Tobacco</a>

The latest issue of Vanity Fair carried a piece
about anti-smoking gadfly Dr. Wigand, who claims
that some pipe tobacco contains the chemical 
coumarin. Now, as far as I am concerned, Wigand
is more than slightly off target, but coumarin
is a common rat poison, and not the sort of thing
I care to smoke.

Does anyone out there know if there is coumarin
(a/k/a Warfarin, I believe) in all pipe tobacco,
and, if so, what is its purpose? Don't worry,
I will stay a committed pipe smoker and an opponent
of banning smoking in public places; I am just
interested.

Incidentally, is there any airline that permits
pipe smoking? I just flew SAS, and if they don't,
who would? Methinks smokers of aromatic blends
should get a discount for freshening the air of
the plane, rather than being prevented from
enjoying our pipes on board. 

Yitzchak.

[Yitzchak, I'm sure that if Wigand and his ilk could connect pipe
smoking with Satanism and Ebola Zaire, they would.  Regardless,
they'll probably try.  It's the old "let's force them to deny it"
trick.  Nonetheless, if anyone has any hard info, please let us
know. -S. ]

Just got back from a three-day vacation trip
to Copenhagen, where I spent most of my time 
buying pipes and tobacco.

If anyone finds themselves there, the best place
to buy pipes is Poul Hansen Pipe Shop, on the 
Stroget pedestrian street. (Frederiksberggade 36;
at the beginning of the closed street) Their 
selection is excellent, especially of Nording
pipes, and the proprietor is very knowledgeable
and helpful. I purchased 3 Nordings, as well
as 4 discontinued and heavily discounted (and
all gone) Bjarne giant briars. Be sure to get a
VAT refund cheque from him when you purchase;
you receive 12 or so per cent back at the 
airport.

There is also an excellent tobacco blendery,
Paul Olsen, at Gammel Mont 4, where tobacco
is blended on the premises and can be sampled
before your choice is put into 100 gramme tins
for you. (Danish law forbids sales by weight)
Tobacco is European price; most of these blends
are available in the States for much less under
different names. However, for those like me who
reside outside the US, this store has the best
selection I have ever seen, and I have been to
many a tobacconist in many a city.

My trip to Denmark also yielded a tin of Perique,
packaged under the Robert McConnell name in London.'
I also recall that Wally Frank sold Perique by mail,
perhaps successor Finck Cigar also does.

I would recommend Perique to Havana-deprived cigar smokers; it reminds me of
a very strong cigar, like some of the stronger
Havanas I have smoked.

Again thank you!

_______________________________________________________________________________

Dear Nick,

I read your submittal to the Pipe Digest.  I would like to tell you my story
regarding pipe smoking.  First of all, I just turned 30 years old on April
5, 1996.

When I was a little boy and when my maternal grandfather was still
alive; of whom I was and still am very fond of.  I would watch him
fill, tamp, and light his pipe several times during the day.  Grandpa
smoked Half and Half tobacco and Marlboro cigarettes.  Grandpa loved
to smoke, he would smoke several bowls a day.  It seemed like grandpa
was always smoking his briar pipes.

Grandpa had a collection of about 20 pipes in his collection.  The pipes
where always on a special table designed to hold his pipes, cleaners, and
tools of the trade.  Grandpa would sit in his leather wing back chair, put
his feet up on the stool and begin the ritual of pipe smoking.  Grandpa was
very fond of the Native American Indians and I am sure that this ritual for
him was much like sitting around the indian fire and smoking the Peace Pipe.

Grandpa always seemed at peace with life.  Grandpa found great peace of mind
and spirit in his several hobbies that he held very dear to him.  Grandpa
loved to paint birds on wood, this was done with great care and detail.
Grandpa also loved to make pen and ink drawings on board.  He would draw
same the great literary giants like Mark Twain, Edgar Allan Poe, and Robert
Frost.  He also drew Great American figures like Abraham Lincoln and several
Native American Indians.  I am sure that the combination of his talent and
the peace that pipe smoking brought to him helped create some of the nicest
pieces of art that I own.

When my grandfather died I was still very young.  I remember going the my
grandparent's home for the funeral, I could still smell grandpa's tobacco
lingering through the house.  I always liked smelling grandpa's smoke.  When
we where going through grandpa's things, I remember looking very long at his
pipes, his pouch and the numerous butane lighters that he had.  I remember
putting the used pipes up to my mouth and drawing on them as if I were the
smoker.  It tasted very bitter, but I did it any way, I did it because I
wanted to be the same wonderfully kind and gentle person that my grandfather
was.

Obviously I was not allowed to smoke since I was still in grade school.
During my high school years I did own a couple of pipes, nothing to write
home about.  I think the pipes where Dr. Garbo.  I smoked drug store tobacco
only occasionally.

When I graduated from high school in 1984 moved in with my older brother.
At that time I was living near Chicago and found a Tinder Box.  I bought a
couple of Tinder Box pipes and a pouch of tobacco.  I thought I had died and
gone to heaven.  I now owned 5 pipes.  My older brother gave me a 3 pipe
stand the one with the glass jar for tobacco.  I had finally arrived as a
pipe smoker.

I lived with my brother for a year and a half and then I joined a Catholic
Monastery.  I was considered normal to smoke a pipe.  I stayed with the
group of Monks for almost 3 years.  When I left I went back to smoking
cigarette.  About 2 years ago I started smoking pipes again.  I had to start
over since I had disposed of all of the early pipes.

I was living in Milwaukee Wisconsin when I decided to start smoking pipes
again and I found Edward's Pipe and Tobacco on the north side of town.  The
owners name was Dean and he helped me get started smoking pipes again.  This
time I had someone to ask all of the questions I wanted to ask, Dean always
provided me with good answers and great encouragement.  His store was very
conducive to a fraternal environment.  His tobacco counter was the main hang
out.  I went to the store almost every day of the week.  I found friends
that wanted to help make pipe smoking an enjoyable hobby for me.  The kind
of took me under their wings.

Since then I have moved to Palm Springs California.  I miss Edward's and all
of the gang, but I have found the Tinder Box in Palm Springs and it is owned
and operated by a father and son team.  Garry is the son and he and his wife
Gerry worked most of the time.  I go to the store quite often and can be
found there every Saturday morning from 9:30 am until 1:00 pm or so.  I have
found great friendship in the store, it is not the same as Edward's but I
like it.

Since moving to Palm Springs my collection of pipes has grown from 12 briar
pipes to 67 pipes.  My collection consists of several Edward's own,
Savinelli, Ben Wade, Nording, Charatan and a Dunhill.  My collection is
mostly straight pipes, however I do have 12 freehand pipes.  I have found
that I do like straights better than bents.  Currently I am smoking the
Tinder Box tobacco called Chartwell.  I find that I change tobaccos often.
I have tried the english tobacco, but I do not like the fragrance as much as
I do with the aromatics.

I hope that this helps you.  If you have any questions, or if you would like
to keep in touch from time to time please feel free.  I enjoy talking to
other people who like to smoke pipes.

Keep the embers burning!

Stephen A. Johnson

<a name="26">Subject: [PIPES]</a>

Hello, Steve,

  You know, sometimes life is hard, what with the daily struggle to survive
and all.  But every once in a while we find or make a little piece of
paradise and for a short time things don't seem so bad.
  This last weekend was almost perfect spring weather.  Okay, so it was a
little hazy, but that just meant that the marine layer was cooling
temperatures back down to where they belonged--in the mid-80s.  The maple
tree's leaves had filled out nicely creating plenty of shade--time to give
the new hammock a trial run.  So there I was Sunday afternoon, in the
hammock in the shade, a cold drink close by, and a cigar in hand (a Royal
Jamaica in case anyone's interested).  For about an hour it was paradise--a
cool breeze, the flowers a riot of color, birds singing, rich and fragrant
smoke curling above my head.
  Later on one could find me stretched out in my easy chair in front of a
baseball game eating some leftover pizza, drinking some brown ale, followed
up by McClelland's Deep Hollow tobacco in a favorite pipe.  Ah, bliss.

  A couple of weeks ago I was in Denver for a seminar and managed to visit
three tobacconists--and buy three new pipes in the process, one from each
store.  The first shop I visited was Tobacco Haven in the Northglen Mall.
It was kind of strange.  First of all, it was the first time I have ever
seen a dying mall.  There must have been 2 or 3 stores closed and shuttered
for every one open and shoppers were few and far between.  It was
positively eerie.  The shop itself was fairly large with about 2/3 taken up
with beer steins and similar gift items.  The rest was pipes, cigars,
tobacco, and smoking accessories.  And they actually had a pretty fair
selection of everything.  It's just that the store was--what's a good word?
Cluttered, maybe--but no, I've been in other pipe shops that were
cluttered, but in a friendly, inviting way.  Maybe disheveled is what I'm
looking for.  The pipes looked like they were tossed into the display cases
any which way, but to even see the display cases, one had to move bunches
of stuff out of the way.  The cigar humidor was fairly large and had a good
selection, but everything looked pawed through--no one apparently goes
through and straightens things out.  There were boxes in the corners piled
floor to ceiling and--well, you get the picture.  In spite of all this, I
managed to buy a smallish freehand made in Denmark by a company called
Knute which I hadn't heard of before.  It's not a flawless piece of wood,
but at the price I didn't expect it to be.  It is, however, rather handsome
and a good smoke.  If anyone knows anything about Knute pipes and would be
willing to share, I'd appreciate the info.
  The second shop was an Edward's on south Broadway in Englewood.  This was
a small shop and because of space constraints, selection was limited, but
all the bases were covered:  pipes, cigars, lighters, humidors, tobacco,
racks, tampers, pouches, etc.  It appeared to me that a lot of their
mid-range pipes carried their own house logo.  They also had some nice
freehands and a few high-end pipes.  I found a nice meerschaum with a
bell-shaped bowl at a very reasonable price.  I was also able to pick up
some Fuente Hemingway Signature cigars.  These can sometimes be hard to
find, so I was pleased to pick up a few.  The fellow who was manning the
shop was pleasant, friendly, and knowledgable.  I definitely would go back
to Edward's in spite of it's small size.
  The last shop I visited was Jerri's in downtown Denver.  This was a
nicely appointed shop and all the staff seemed real knowledgable about
their products.  They had a fair selection of pipes, cigars, tobaccos and
accessories.  At this shop I purchased a Barling pipe.  Now I have heard
(probably here in the Digest) that Barlings aren't the pipe they used to
be, but this one appealed to me.  It's a 3/4-bent billiard with nice grain
for the money and is very reminiscent of a Peterson's--including a Peterson
system-like chamber for collecting moisture and a silver-toned cap (I don't
know the proper term here) over the shank where the stem fits in.  What it
didn't have was the Peterson bit which I personally don't care for.
All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this pipe.  I've smoked it a couple of
times and it offers a cool, dry smoke.  In summary, I will return to
Jerri's the next time I'm in Denver.
  By the way, Steve, I didn't include addresses because I'm pretty sure
that Jerri's and Edward's at least are in the Resource Guide.  If you want
addresses, etc., let me know and I'll send them along.
  Anyway, I'm sure I've taken up more than my fair share of space, so I'll
wind down now.  I'm back in the middle of another work week and life is
hard again, but wait!  There's another weekend coming and maybe, just
maybe, I'll be able to create another moment of paradise--one that of
course includes pipe or cigar in hand.

--Ed

[ I checked, Ed, and Jerri's and Edward's are indeed in the Guide.

[ADMIN] Despite Steve Beaty's and my best efforts to prevent it, I've
gotten more member complaints about email spamming by Cigar Trading
Lda.  Since I've received no response to my letters to the postmaster
at Cigar Trading's site, I must also assume that the site is
rogue. I'll iterate: if you don't like unsolicited commercial junk
email, don't buy from Cigar Trading Lda.

And now, to the mails, over which I've been procrastinating for _far_
too long, and which do contain far better things!  

Interestingly enough, I'm finding more and more that someone asks a
question in the same issue in which, as it happens, someone else has
given the answer!  Coincidence... or fate?  You decide!

<a name="2">Subject: thanks for the subscription!</a>

        I've been an on-again, off-again subscriber to the Pipe Digest for
several years, and was recently re-added to the list.  It is a consistently
enjoyable and informative read on a very interesting topic.  Thank you
tremendously for doing such an excellent job!

        Wonderful things happen sometimes if you smoke a pipe.
        A couple of years ago I met a young lady while I was volunteering
for a local non-profit.  I thought she was attractive but when she told me
the smell of my pipe smoke reminded her of her grandfather, I doubted there
was much chance of a future with her.
        Time passed, and things happened.  I married her in the fall, and we
are now expecting a baby boy in July.
        I should be asking for recommendations about good cigars.  (-:

Dear Steve,

     Being a new subscriber, I don't know if this has already been done.  I
think it may be of interest to others, exactly what your subscribers
demographics are.  List things like:
age, education, marital status, tobacco/pipe preference, etc.  I have read
several letters from some of the younger pipe smokers that are suprised that
other young men share our interests.  i believe a poll would reveal quite a
diverse grou of men (and even ladies).  I understand that this may be of some
undertaking, but it's something to think about!?!?

                                            Thanks for a Great Digest,

Hello Steve and Fellow pipesmokers!

In Pipes Digest #216 Spencer Martin wrote a comment about the new Pipes
Digest strategy regarding email adresses of the new subscribers.
I totally agree with Spencer. Reading the new subscribers list to see
where people actally come from, is a most enjoyable start on reading the
Digest. 
I understand the problem that email adresses are used by companys to send
out junk mail. But I would still like it, if at least the domain
(.no,.uk,.com or .whatever) was left outside the subscriber. 
And as far as I now, the domains that end in a .com .edu .org an the like
are US adresses. All other countrys have the country domain name as the
last in the adress. This may not be true for all adresses, but I think in
the majority this is the case.
Just my opinion.

Keep up the good work Steve!

just the person's full name and domain.

<a name="7">Subject: pipe question and change of address!</a>

Hi Steve!

I would just like to say what a great job that you do on the digest.  

I am a college student about 20 years old who enjoys a pipe greatly.  I have
been smoking for about (in 11 days) two years.  I have a quite modest
collection with a few great pieces (2 of the five being dunhills, a peterson
captian pete, nording, and a stanwell).  I also am in a unique situation of
which not many of your readers can say, I work in a tobacco shop during the
summers and Christmas break, The Tinder Box of Winston-Salem.  I have worked
there going on my fourth year.  It is a great place to work.  Where else is a
person encourged to smoke offten as possible  

I have suffered the strange looks that accompany a young pipe smoker. I once
thought a older gentleman (60+or-) was going to walk off a set of steps and
fall because he was looking so intently.  Some people think it is stupid,
others think that "he just does it to get attention", but many of my friends
are quite interested in learning more and trying it from time to time.  We
sometimes have a classic example of the peacepipe image going around the room
sharing to delicate leaf.

The main reason for writing is the fact that I am now at home and wish to
continue to recive the digest.  My address was ???????@??????.????????.??? .
That has now changed to ??????????@???.??? .  (This address is one that is a
little form of rebellian, I forgot to mention that I attend Appalachian State
University in Boone, NC.  Several years ago they had a mountian man as their
mascot, which incleded a pipe, a wiskey jug and a gun, but they decided that
he should become PC.  The end result was the man with no pipe, no jug and no
gun.  His name is Yosef, therefore Yosefsmoke(s) is a great form of protest.)
 I would appreciate the changing.

Number 2 reason for writing:
Thursday, I am traveling to Washington, D.C.  I was wondering if there are
any great pipe/tobacco shops around that area that I should add to the trip?

Thanks so much!  Keep puffing!  ~~

[ John B. Hayes, in Fairfax, VA, is not to be missed.  Dr. John
Weinstein at the Capital Area Pipe Smokers (CAPS) would have other
suggestions, I'm sure; he's in the Guide.  And thanks for keeping
Yosef politically incorrect and happy! -S. ]

Hi Steve-

[Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

I would have liked to register the domain name "cohiba.com", but it was
already taken!  I wonder how many other famous brands are registered as
domain names?

Thanks for running such an informative and entertaining list.  I would'nt
mind you spinning off a cigars-only list, as I'm not interested much in pipe
smoking (although I find much of the pipe information to be fascinating).
The problem I see with the current format is the sheer size of the list; I
don't like it when a transmission is broken into two parts.  I'm guessing
you do this because some recipients can't handle messages over a certain
size.  So I vote for two lists, one for cigars and the other for pipes;
interested parties could subscribe to both.

regards, Phil Glatz

I am in the process of writing books on GBDs and Charatans and would
appreciate members assistance in obtaining any copies of old literature
concerning styles, numbers, models, and grades. The books will be
illustrated and contain this information as well as photos, in addition to
other information on the pipes. I am also taking photos of pipes, so if
any members would like to possibly have some of their collection included,
please contact me. I will of course give full credit for the photos, if
desired, and also return any literature. Thanks in advance for your

<a name="10">Subject: Smokeless Cigarettes</a>

Steve:

With reference to GideonH's post last issue about smokeless cigarettes,
there were a few items I thought might clear the smoke about this
particular product.

The cigarettes, named "Premier" and developed by RJR/Nabisco (R. J.
Reynolds), never formally came to market.  Development costs were in
excess of $200 million.  There were a number of concerns, including the
"safer cigarette" problem.  Foremost was the quality.  They were never
well-liked, but when lit with sulfur matches the resulting odor and taste
was best described by James Garner in the movie "Barbarians at the Gate":

"Dammit, these things taste like sh*t and smell like a fart!  Well, that'll
make a great billboard slogan!"

The movie, which covers the RJR/Nabisco LBO battle between Ross Johnson
(the CEO portrayed by Garner) and KKR, is well worth renting for both
entertainment value and a reasonably accurate description of the sad
history of Premier.  Premier played a major role in the outcome of the
fight.

However, the cigarette was never officially reviewed by any government
agency (as far as I know) and threatened to be classified as a drug.  This
idea is far more recent than the Premier (late '80s).

I hope this isn't too far off topic.

In PD #216, Steve Carney was looking for a pipe case for several large pipes. 
I solved this problem for myself in an amazingly inexpensive way. Found a 
padded shaving kit which holds 6 pipes nicely (though loose they don't rattle 
or bang around; if they did, some "bubble wrap" would keep them from knocking 
together). The kit fits a briefcase and cost all of $2.50 in a discount 
store. Best of all, it's washable. Small side compartment is great for 
cleaners.

Steve- in last week's edition someone was asking about devices for
safely transporting pipes while travelling.  I came up with what for
me has been a very satisfactory solution: pistol cases.  These are
available in several sizes, from ones to hold a single pistol up to
ones to hold three or four.  Inside the cases have a very thick layer
of foam rubber in a sort of undulating hill and valley pattern that
can shape itself to what ever is enclosed.  The exterior is very tough
high impact plastic which is nigh on to indestructible.  I bought a
single pistol case at the hallowed home base store of Cabelas, the
huge mailorder sports and hunting outfitters.  This one comfortably
holds four standard size straight pipes, more could fit if the pipes
were on the smallish side.  Two big advantages: pipes of virtually any
shape can be accomodated, and the cases themselves are CHEAP.  For me,
a perfect solution- once inside this case and latched shut, nothing
will budge no matter how the !  case itself gets knocked around.

[ But can you take your pipes aboard an airplane? :-) -S. ]

<a name="13">Subject: New member bio</a>

Steve,

Have been reading the digest for a couple of months now and I thoroughly
enjoy every issue. I thought it about time to stop being a passive reader and
contribute something of my own.  So, here is my new member bio.

My name is Steve Hahn, I am 38 years old and have been smoking a pipe for 1
year now.  I am a reformed cigarette smoker and my lungs are happy to say
that I have not smoked a cigarette since I took up the pipe.  I took to pipe
smoking very easily (no major problems) and really enjoy my new hobby.

My father smoked a pipe years ago and he was a good source of information to
get me started.  I own two pipes now.  A Charatan Trafalgar - nice and light,
cool smoking with a beautiful cross-grain.  I really enjoy this pipe.  My
second pipe is only 2 months old.  It is  an Aldo Velani sandblast with a
very slight bend.  A bit heavy but smokes beautifully.  I usually smoke the
Charatan on my way to work (I have a one hour commute) since it is lighter
and easier to handle in the car.  My Velani I save for home where holding it
in my jaw is not imperative.

As far as tobacco, I started with aromatics and have moved to English blends.
 I don't like the wet nature of the aromatics.  A new friend (made at the
Port Royal shop in Toledo, OH) introduced me to Balkan Sobranie.  I simply
can't get enough of this right now but I know this will change.  I also enjoy
Dunhill's My Mixture #???.  Maybe some of your readers could suggest
something I might enjoy since they now know my taste.  I have been going
through the back issues at a lesiurely pace and came across a tobacco
description of a blend called "Midnight".  Either the writer was a
reincarnated Hemingway, or this is truly an exquisite blend!!  He made it
sound delicious, and I would love to try it.  Anyway, I can not find the back
issue.  Hopefully whoever wrote the description will contact me and tell me
how to find it.  Or anyone else for that matter.

Thanks again for the terrific job you do with the digest.  Hope to write
again sometime.  Peace

Steve Hahn

<a name="16">Subject: aromatic vs. English/Virginia</a>

Hi there, Steve and fellow pipesters.  I'm just taking a few lines here 
to jot down some reflections on aromatic pipe tobaccos inspired by a 
freshly opened can of McLintock tobak.  When I started pipe-smoking I was 
steered, both by my local tobacconist and by my preconceptions of what 
pipe tobacco was supposed to smell like, firmly towards what I later 
learned to call aromatics.  In fact, for at least the first year of my 
smoking career, I thought all pipe tobacco was supposed to smell sweet 
and fruity and the sweeter and fruitier the better.  
	My first experience with the English blends came through Blatter 
and Blatter in Montreal, an excellent tobacconist/pipe-maker in Montreal 
whose name has already appeared many times in this digest.  Anyway, I 
tried one of their own English-style blends (I can't even remember which 
one), and for the first time experienced the true, unaldulterated flavour 
of fine tobacco.  
	Within a couple of months, I had completely abandoned the many 
aromatic blends which I had come to love, in favour of such ambrosia as 
Red Rapparee, St. Bruno's Flake, Dunhill's My Mixture, anything from 
Blatter and Blatter, and indeed virtually anything that comes in a can 
labelled "Made in England".  I am ashamed to say that I even became 
somewhat of a snob.  I thought of aromatics as artificial-tasting, 
glycol-laden, soggy-smoking crap.  They were universally made of inferior 
flavourless tobacco and, while the ladies seemed to prefer those who 
smoked them, a true pipe-smoker wouldn't touch an aromatic blend with a 
ten-foot pipe-cleaner.  I actually went so far as to feel real pity for 
those around me who could not appreciate the complexities of a matured 
virginia or an English blend with enough Smyrna and Latakia to clear a 
garden party.
	To get to the point, let me say that I have now modified, if not 
quite changed, my tune.  Out of curiosity, I just bought a can of a blend 
called "Blanc de Blancs" by a German company by the name of McLintock 
(sound German to you?).  Let me quote from the label:

	"...a mixture based on the best tobacco grades growing in the 
	U.S.A. regions of South Carolina, the East and Middle Belt, and 
	Georgia- with a pinch of Turkish Izmir for spice.  But the mystery 
	of the blend is in its flavour: Selected exotic and Frech Provence 
	herbes soaked with Dry Champagne- well aged in wooden casks until..."

	Well, suffice it to say that here is an aromatic that I like.  It 
has no glycol whatsoever, as far as I can tell, it has a wonderful winey 
aroma (the herbes (sic) are pretty understated) that you can smell all 
the way across the room from the open can, and it tastes great.  The 
flavour is mild, but very good.  It is clear that if this tobacco had 
been aged equally without the flavouring, it would still be excellent.  I 
guess McLIntock has a number of other blends and I would love to sample 
them as well.  If anyone out there knows the other blends, or simply 
shares my taste for English/Virginia blends and would like to compare 
notes, I'd appreciate an e-mail: ??????@???????.????.???????.??.

Hi Steve and fellow digest members,

My dad recently returned from a trip to Costa Rica and brought back, as a 
present to me, a very interesting sort of pipe.  I've been smoking for 
three years, and while I like to think I know something about pipes, 
tobacco, and smoking I must confess I've never seen a pipe like the one 
my dad bought me down there.  Let me describe it.  Naturally I invite any 
commentary from my fellow pipe smokers:

It is one solid piece of wood, there is no removable stem.  I am 
confident that it is not briar, maybe its teak, but again, I don't know 
if one can make a pipe from teak.  It has a very extreme curve, with the 
bowl being @ 4 inches beneath the bit.  It is a deep red color, but let me 
add that I have some "red" briar pipes and this Costa Rican one is a 
different shade entirely.  It smokes very well, but I must confess a need 
for added agility with my mouth, since the bit is wooden, and part of the 
whole pipe itself.  Additionally, I find myself having to exercise a 
degree of caution when cleaning it for fear of lodging the pipe cleaner 
in the pipe for all time.  At any rate, I was just curious, as this pipe 
is itself very curious.  As always, happy smoking!

<a name="19">Subject: Coumarin aka Warfarin</a>

Hi Steve..

This is my first letter to the digest - and may I say what a pleasure it is
to read...

Re Coumarin.
I suppose that this should come from one of our knowledgeable medical
friends but I will stick my nose in for what it is worth regarding
coumarin/Warfarin, so that anyone confronted with this as a reason for not
smoking a pipe has some ammunition to shoot it down.

Warfarin is a commonly used rat poison -I am not certain but I believe it
works by thinning the blood in the animal concerned and by causing
hypothermia. Rats or mice so treated become slowed down, and usually die of
cold.( I can vouch for this - I used to work in an agricultural/garden store
where it was used). There may be other ways in which it kills, but in cold
England this is mainly what happens. The dose however, is massive, for the
size of the creature.

If warfarin does exist in pipesmoke so what? It is commonly used,  commonly
used to treat heart conditions and probably counters the effect of nicotine,
which constricts of blood vessels.... but by how much? The amount of the
chemical is probably far less significant to our general health than the
pollutants from Petrol/Diesel engines or residual radiation - or even the
chemical pollution in our daily diet due to pesticides/herbicides.

As  a side issue... I used to have a cat which developed  locked joints
(ankylosing spondylitis (spelling?):-)) through eating to much vitamin D in
Liver, and I am told by a hospital dietician that too much vitamin C can
cause kidney stones.. Should there be a campain for the banning of Liver or
Citrus fruits and potatoes? And what about the onion? - that would be banned
if it were introduced now. 

Why can't these people leave us to make our own judgement?

<a name="20">Subject: Smoking Rat Poison</a>

Steve --

I don't know whether there is rat poison in pipe tobacco, and furthermore I 
don't care. Just as I don't care that there are deadly poisons, including 
arsenic, occurring naturally in most of the vegetables I eat (people have 
actually died from an overdose of potatoes) or that the medicines I take are 
toxic (aspirin, a blood thinner, works much like rat poison). Things we take 
for granted are lethal compounds: the caffeine in coffee and theobromine in 
chocolate. Even the vaunted herbal remedies contain toxins and carcinogens 
(pennyroyal and comfrey come to mind) that would not be tolerated if a factory 
put them there.

It is an axiom of toxicologists that "the dose makes the poison" Many 
compounds, natural and manufactured, that are deadly at one dosage are 
harmless or even beneficial at low doses. So if there's rat poison in my 
tobacco, I'm not going to worry about it until I hear stories of pipe smokers 
crawling off into the walls and bleeding to death.

<a name="21">Subject: Tongue Bite verses Peppery Taste</a>

[In Pipes Digest #216 I said...]

&gt; 2.  Many of the cavendish tobaccos I've tried impart a stinging or
&gt; bitter sensation on the back of my tongue and throat, especially when
&gt; smoked heavily.  Which tobacco leaf actually causes this effect?  I
&gt; suspect maybe some sort of Virginia tobacco, because some of the
&gt; blends which exhibit this boast flavorings with a Virginia base.  The
&gt; Blatter Reserve I like so much gives no such problem.  Blatter Reserve
&gt; is a very dark color... does this mean it lacks Virginia?  I don't
&gt; like this "peppery" sensation and would like to know which tobacco I
&gt; need steer clear of to avoid it.

[Steve responded...]

&gt; I don't think the type of tobacco has as much to do with bite as
&gt; its proper humidity, its packing in the bowl, and your smoking style.  Pay
&gt; attention to these and you'll learn the fine points.  To some extent, other
&gt; substances might make a bite worse (for me, these include mint toothpaste or
&gt; vinegar) or lessen the chance of getting bitten (sweet drinks like wine or
&gt; iced tea seem to help.)  I'd also advise you never to smoke with a bitten
&gt; tongue.  

&gt; Also see the next article re bite; it's very interesting! -S.

I think you may have misunderstood my question Steve.

The "stinging" effect that I get on the *back* of my tongue is not what I
think you mean by tongue bite.  Isn't tongue bite the almost burning, 
soreness or scalded feeling one gets on the middle or front of the tongue 
caused by (what the article from Charles Basso in PD #116) smoke chemistry?  
I'm sure that the effect I feel is also caused by smoke chemistry, but I only 
feel it when I swallow during smoking.  It's like I swallowed something 
peppery.

With tobacco blends that cause this, the effect gets more pronounced the
farther down the bowl of tobacco is smoked... sometimes to the point that I
can't stand to finish the bowl.  I thought you mentioned once in the Pipe
Digest that you sometimes only smoke a bowl of tobacco half way down because
the taste becomes increasingly harsh.  Maybe I'm talking about the same
thing when I describe the peppery feeling.  This taste doesn't linger after
ceasing smoking like tongue bite.

When this effect happens, I can take a sip of coffee or water and that seems
to wash the taste away temporarily.  It's very unpleasant, and while I
sometimes like the initial taste of certain blends that cause this problem,
by the time I'm 2/3 through the bowl I get disgusted with it.

Even though I'm a newbie at this, it seems logical to me that a certain
tobacco is directly responsible for this.  I notice it predominantly with
certain cavendish blends.  I just finished a bowl of C&amp;D's "Dark Chocolate"
and it causes this.  In contrast, I have gotten what I think you mean by
tongue bite from medium and heavy English blends *without* getting the
"peppery" taste on the very back of my tongue when swallowing during
smoking.

I'm just wondering if anyone else who reads the Pipes Digest experiences what 
I'm describing, or is it just me?

Take care,

John

Hi Steve,

     For sometime now, Mike Dunk and I have been working to have 
a carving news group established.  We have finally arrived at the 
voting stage of a fairly formal procedure. Although this is for all cavers,
I believe it would be a good place to help any pipe carvers (such as myself)
exchange ideas and info on pipes as well.

     Anyone interested in seeing the carving group get started should 
search through their news provider to find any of the following 
newsgroups:
news.announce.newgroups
news.groups
rec.woodworking
rec.crafts.misc
alt.crafts.professional
misc.creativity

     Posted to these groups is a message entitled 
"CFV:rec.crafts.carving".  This message outlines the charters and 
reason for the group and details how you can place your vote.  Voting 
is a formal process and rules must be followed if the vote is to 
count.  The approval of the group depends on the voting numbers and 
the count can be a little complicated.  We need a minimum of 100 yes 
votes over any no votes and at least 2/3 of the votes must be yes 
votes.

letter written to her home by a Russian princess living in Sitka about the
ceremony to transfer possession of Alaska from Russia to U.S. representatives.

  "Although we had already signified our intention of becoming American
  citizens, Arkady, as you would expect, wanted the farewell Russian
  performance carried out with proper dignity, as would befit the honor
  of a great empire.  He rehearsed our Russian soldiers with great care
  in the lowering of our flag and I helped mend torn uniforms and
  supervised the polishing of shoes.  I must say that our troops looked
  pipe-clay neat when Arkady and I were finished".

I assume that this refers to the bright white appearance of a clay pipe when
new or after being burned clean in a fireplace (as described in The Ultimate

Tks very much for your welcome msg and also for the first Digest
received last week.  First of all I must introduce myself, I'm 47
years old, cigarettes smoker for more than 30 years and fortunately
pipe smoker for two more and hope that for ever, also I must beg your
perdon for my bad english.  I tried to change to pipe several times in
the past but then there is not exist Internet, it's is not a joke !!.
With this easy way of comunication, I have found a lot of Web pages of
people that seems to be very happy with this "hobby"(?), "way of

Kevin Cook for his kindest conseils and Craig Tarler for his kind
attention.  While I wait for sample packs from Cornell &amp; Diehl, I am
trying some blends I can get in Canary Islands where I live, presently
I like very much "Gold Block" and Dunhill's "Early Morning" and
"London" also I like "Three Nuns" and "St.Bruno" but I still have not
a definive choice having in mind that I am smoking 8/9 pipes daily,
four of them chained.  I think that better blend to smoke chained,
within of blends tried, can be "Gold Block" but I would like to
receive from you any suggestion to permit increase my curiosity.  I
dont know if this will be my first input as well as my last one
because I can be accused for torturing you with my words from a
begginer and my awfull english, anyway I want to finish saying that
now I enjoy my smoke, I feel better and for first time I have found an
special pleasure in smoking and I dont want to come back to my 60
cigarettes per day.  Tks for your patient and best regards.  Ignacio
Martin.

	Well, I just got my first Pipes Digest, and I'm very glad I
subscribed.  You ask for submissions, and I find that, indeed, I have
something to submit.  People seem to write about their first
pipe-smoking experience, and mine was pretty typical, it seems, so I'm
going to write about something else -- my visit to the Ashton pipe
factory.
	I recently came over to England to get a DPhil, and -- still
being fairly new to smoking -- I didn't know anything about Ashtons.
However, during the Christmas break, Bill Ashton came to the local
pipe-shop for a three-day exhibition.  I thought it sounded pretty
interesting, so I went along.  I arrived sometime around lunch-time,
and Bill was in the back eating.  However, as soon as he heard that I
was there to see him, he came out and shook my hand.  I didn't know
who he was -- I'd seen Ashton pipes, but I didn't know that THIS was
the fellow who started/owned the company (I just assumed that he did
the shows or something).  He asked if I had a pipe with me, and when I
produced one, he cleaned it up and advised me on how to get the most
out of it.  He was very personable, and I had no idea of his position
in his company until after I'd left and was looking at the business
card he'd given me.
	During the course of our conversation that day (or the next
day -- of course, I had to go back), he invited me to visit the
factory.  I was eager to take him up on his offer, and I did a couple
of weeks later.  I'd ordered a pipe from him when he was giving the
show, and the visit was a good time to collect it (like I needed an
excuse...).  He picked me up at the train station, and took me out to
the factory -- it's since moved, so this information is a bit out of
date, but when I visit the new factory, I'll send you an update.  He
showed me all the various stages that a chunk of briar goes through in
order to become an Ashton pipe.  He let me use the sand-blaster.  He
let me roam about and poke into corners and ask all my questions.  The
machines (lathes, etc.) he uses are, he told me, no longer made, but
are optimal for producing top-quality pipes.  The finishing work is
done at carrels of the sort used at the old Dunhill factory.  There
were pipes in all stages of completion on every flat surface, but he
could tell you exactly where the pipes for order N were.  It was
great.
	Of course, I also got my pipe, and it's easily the best in my
(quite humble) collection.  I'm getting another as soon as I can.  The
technique he uses (and has patented) for curing the briar produces a
very nice smoke, and the stem -- made of a material he has patented as
well -- has all the qualities he attributed to it (strong without
being brittle -- much like vulcanite except that it doesn't discolor).
As you can tell, I'm sold on Ashtons and had better stop before this
note turns into an advertisement.
	Regards,  Glenn.

[ I read a nice piece on S&amp;R Anderson recently (in Pipe Friendly?),
and they mentioned that they _had_ managed to get pipemaking machines
cast specially.  And then they had lots of fun learning how to set
them up and use them.  So it's not impossible; just difficult. Thanks! -S. ]

Steve,

        a couple of quick thing on the web page.  1) i've added an index to
the end of all the digest and a pointer to it at the beginning.  may help
some people find specific articles they are interested in.  2) on the
removing of email addresses, i was thinking we could rip out the addresses
on the From: line only and leave those in the articles.  this would allow
people to choose for themselves whether their email address is in their
signature.  just a thought.  live well!

<a name="37">Subject: trip report</a>

Steve and all,

        well, i'm sitting in DaVinci, the Rome airport.  it's six in the
morning, and i didn't end up spending the night on a bench here, as i've
done before, but that's telling the end of story before the beginning.

        i'm on a two-week trip visiting Italy and India for a conference and
some HP work.  recently, Enzo Medici created a cool personal pipe-smoking
page at <a href="http://www.flashnet.it/medici/">http://www.flashnet.it/medici/</a>  we did a little corresponding, and
he graciously invited me to stop by if i was ever in Roma.  well, little did
he know that i had a trip planned in the next two weeks :-)  so, we met each
other in the airport one Sunday and he and his wonderful daughter and wife
took me to a great lunch and showed me around Roma a little.  i saw where
"Il Circolo della Pipa" (<a href="http://www.flashnet.it/medici/pipeclub.htm),">http://www.flashnet.it/medici/pipeclub.htm),</a> the
Roma pipe club meets.  they have their own building!  i took a picture or
two of it, i may scan one of them in for the pipes page...  Enzo gave me a
copy of the Italian magazine "Smoking".  it's helped me with my rusty
Italian :-)  on the cover there are three beautiful pipes shown, a Dunhill,
a Savinelli, and the actual Castello that Enzo was smoking when he met me in
the airport.  235 of them were made and it's a nice pipe.  speaking of nice
pipes, Enzo has more than a few.  Dunhills, Ser Jacapos, Savinellis; you get
the idea...  beautiful, one and all.

        the president of Circolo della Pipa is Fausto Fincato and Enzo
maintains that he has the best pipe shop in Roma.  Fincato is already in the
resource guide, and Enzo would know the best.

        the food was great, the company was better (Enzo and his daughter
Annalisa speak wonderful English, much better than my Italiano).  Enzo then
gave me a pipe.  not just any pipe.  one that had been made especially for
him (his initials are on it).  unsmoked.  straight grained.  beautiful.  i
was beyond words, and truth is, still am.  i will always cherish this pipe.
i'll take some pictures of it and put them on the web page too.

        Enzo has a nice web page and a nice setup at home.  fast computer,
and a bigger monitor than i have :-)  he was very humble (umile, a new
Italiano word for me) about all that he did for me.  they put me on a train
for Napoli a very happy camper.  i was on the island of Ischia for five
days.  had a great La Gloria Cubana cigar while there.  paradise...  warm,
beautiful, and a good cigar to help commemorate the event.  gotta find a
place to get more of those cigars...  like i'm the only person looking...
had an A.F. short story two years ago on Ischia: it's good to take great
cigars for moments like those.

        back to reality.  i took the train back to Roma whereupon i missed
my flight to Delhi.  it was evening, there were no more planes for India
that night, and all the hotels were full :-(  could have been major sadness
if i hadn't had Enzo's cellular phone number.  i called him asking for help
in finding a place to stay for the night, and he insisted i stay with him.
the beautiful Annalisa gave up her room for the weary traveler, we had
another great meal, and i slept like a baby...  Enzo took me to the airport
early in the morning as the trains don't run that early (we're spoiled by
all the flights and transportation here in the States...)

        nothing to report from India.  not a big pipe-smoking place it appears.

        so the upshot of this rambling tome is: i am once again amazed how
nice pipe smokers can be.  i have memories from this trip that will last a
lifetime.  a public thanks to Enzo and his family.  i look forward to being
able to repay their kindness when they visit me!

        i'll be near Melbourne Australia the week of June 10; if anybody
wants to get together for a quick bowl, drop me a line!

        ciao!

[ Later... -S. ]

Steve and all,

        i've been playing with the web page some more.  i've added links at
the top to indices that don't have either the smoke trail background (for
those with monochrome monitors) or tables (for users with the AOL or older
Microsoft viewers).  also at the top are links to the major subsections of
the page.  i've also added a change of address form for updating the mailing
list when an email address changes.

        thanks,

Hi Steve,

You may remember me from Sparta Industries where I worked with Doug Allen at
the Pipe factory.  (Dr. Grabow Pipes)

I have moved to Kentucky and am working now at Fruit of the Loom World
Corporate Headquarters.

I've established an e-mail address and tested it thru the internet.  Now that
I'm settled in I'd like to start receiving your magazine again.   Before I
left Sparta Industries, I was informed that I had to UnInstall AOL at work.
(It was corporate policy from UST)  I still miss the pipe factory and the
tobacco industry in general.  They were a great bunch of people to work for;
and with.

Anyway, Please add my new e-mail address to your list again and keep me
posted.

Also:  Do you still send to Doug Allen?  He moved up to corporate office in
Connecticut on or around the first of the year.  I'd like his e-mail address
just to keep in touch - if you have it or can get it - and can send it to me.

If not - no problem, I'll call and get it sometime.

I'm looking forward to getting your magazine, It'll be almost like a visit
from an old friend.

Thanks very much!

Hi Steve!

Just wanted to say that I received your massage. At the moment
I'm reading some of the older Pipes Digest articles, still
very interesting. 

Maybe I should tell you a little of myself: I'm a 27 year old
student from Austria (Graz, bigest town in Austria accept for
Vienna) and I smoke pipes for more then seven years now. In a
few month I will finish my masters degree and then probably go
for the PhD, both in theoretical physics. Besides smoking 
pipes I also enjoy good food (Italian, French) and sometimes
a real good cigar (Dunhill, Davidoff, ...). 

Enough for this time. Best wishes and a calm smoke from

<a name="40">Subject: Picking a good pipe shop</a>

Some time ago, there was a discussion about the quality of service in
tobacco shops (and specifically, sexual discimination). I've been meaning to
send this note for quite some time to propose a response to that problem.

There's one place where you'll almost _never_ see women treated poorly because
they're women, and that's a store that employs women. Both of my favorite
tobacco stores employ women, and I've found them to be consistently helpful in
general. The lady who works (or worked, I haven't been in for a while) at the
Tinder Box in Rockville, MD was a real joy to talk to about pipe shapes and
bowl sizes, and lead to me buying one of my favorite pipes. (Unfortunately, I'm
not up on my terminology enough to describe it right, except that it's got a 
gentle bend, and at this time in my personal and financial life, I stick to
seconds... so you'll just have to take my word on it.)

Even better was the woman at Graybeards of London in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.
She was a real pleasure to deal with last summer. One of the things I remember
best was that she was very helpful to my friends who don't smoke cigars
regularly enough to know what they want, while I walked in, grabbed some big
ring Macanudos and some loose tobacco, and stood around with a silly grin on my
face. I sure hope she's still aroudn this year, seeing as how it's time to
start making beach trips again.

Which reminds me that I made enough of a fixture of myself down there one week
last year that I qualified for a frequent-buyer's card, and I'd like to find 
it if I'm going to the beach next weekend. So I guess I'd better sign off and
start cleaning...

<a name="41">Subject: New member - Me!</a>

Greetings and salutations,

I'm new here and thought I might introduce myself. I'm 38, married for  
10 years (almost), father of 2 children - Shannon is 4 years old, Ian  
is 14 months old. My dad smoked pipes and there are stories (all untrue  
of course :-}) that I bit through the stem of his favorite meershaum  
with my first tooth and that I used his pipes to blow bubbles and that  
when they were dirty I would wash them for him.

I smoked my first pipe in college (about 1977 or so) in self defense  
when my friends were smoking bongs (for those that don't know, a water  
pipe for the inhalation of cannibis). The burning rope smell (of the  
cannibis!) made me nausous. I don't recall what tobacco I smoked or  
even have the pipe anymore. I stopped smoking when it got too expensive  
for me!

I went back to the pipe in Swaziland in 1982 or so and collected a few  
pipes and smoked a blend from a tobacconist is Johannesberg and I  
cannot recall the name of either. It was an English mix similar to the  
C &amp; D #531 Yale. The pipes, but not the tobacco, came back to the  
States and I switched to an cognac aromatic (no, not borkum riff) while  
in grad school with the occasional english mixture thrown in. I met my  
soon to be wife, who while she likes the aroma, cannot stand to kiss  
after I have been puffing. I will give you one guess what went. (I kept  
the pipes though.)

Almost 8 years had passed since I last smoked, when Ian was born. He  
is, shall we say, difficult. He was a gastric reflux baby and required  
full time care. I found myself getting more and more stressed out (I am  
the stay at home dad type as Holly makes a great deal of money as a phd  
chemist). I fondly recalled the days of relaxing pipe puffing and  
decided that maybe it would help. bought some borkum riff (my little  
town does not have a tobacconist). It did and didn't. The stress kept  
coming, I got a flyer from Thompson &amp; Company and ordered some cigars  
(H Upmann and Hoyo de Monterrey) and remembered what I didn't like  
about cigars. Holly suggested I search the Web about pipe tobacco! I  
almost fell off my chair, but then she explained that cigars really  
tasted bad and brushing my teeth and lots of mouth wash did not help.  
Shannon agreed.

I found lots of stuff and here I am. I must say that I am quite  
impressed by the virtual community I have found. I orderd a Cornell &amp;  
Diehl sampler pack from Craig with whom I enjoyed a few moments of  
pleasant converstion, dusted off my pipes and have been happily  
sampling the tobaccos. Shannon does not mind the pipes at all and Ian  
is absolutely fascinated by them. (I think I will keep them up high out  
of his reach just in case pipe use is genetic.....) I was quite pleased  
to discover that my fingers remembered how to pack a pipe. I wonder how  
long it will take to sample all of the C &amp; D tobaccos?

Now I get to start looking for pipes and tobacco pouches and so on. The  
Digest has already helped. But I have discovered to my dismay that pipe  
prices have gone up and choices have become more limited, I am hoping  
the few mail order places listed the Digest will help. I saw one  
listing for a tobacconist in Little Rock, AR and will get there soon.  
Does anyone know of any others in Arkansas? I live in Batesville, and  
while driving to Memphis is an option, Little Rock is easier.

Well, I have probably bored you sill by now, I will puff a pipe and  
contemplate my navel.

May your pipe bowls always be full.

Hello. I just resubscribed to the Pipe Digest after about a year away
from it and pipe smoking in general. It is very nice to be back among
a such fine group of people, I recall looking forward to issues in the
past and continue to find myself looking forward to new issues of the
PD. 

Growing up I had always loved the smell of pipe smoke, and the magic
and process that goes along with smoking a pipe.  My first ill fated
attempt at pipe smoking was with a corncob pipe and very cheap drug
store cherry tobacco. A friend and I tried this and we were both ill
for a day afterward - no trouble keeping the pipe lit [and the pipe
did burn - along with the tobacco... :)]. This effectively paused my
pipe smoking, I have never smoked cigarettes with any kind of
regularity nor cigars - So, I took a few years off from smoking. Then
I happened to be living on campus in a dorm while at school - it was a
cold winter - and since my roommate moved out [of school and the dorm]
about Febuary I had the room to myself - I went to the [then] new pipe
store at the mall and bought a pipe from their "Seconds 25% Off"
basket, a small full bent with a small rounded bowl which continues to
be a good friend and walking companion. While I was there I picked up
a one of their house blends called Prestige [very possibly a Lane[?]
blend??]. At this point I had already discovered the online community
and FAQ - so I was able to light [and keep lit] the pipe and continue
from there. I ordered three heavily stained redish carved pipes via
the mail along with a Zippo Pipe lighter. Two of them are still
unsmoked and the third is smoked, but very occasionally - I don't
really like the bit as much as the bit on my main pipe and the bowl is
a larger too - but it also smokes very nicely. I also have a straight
Dr.Grabow which I used to hand to people when they asked if they could
have a puff of the tobac I was smoking as it smelled good.

About this time a member of the online pipe smoking community sent me
a handful of sample quantities of pipe tobacco - THANKS! - some of which
have become my favorites and I plan on ordering via mailorder as the local
shop doesn't doesn't carry them. These are: Rattray's Black Mallory, 
Cope's Escudo, Bengal Slices and Erinmore Flake. I would like to find a few
tins of Escudo for cellaring [and smoking now] if anyone has any
sitting on a shelf and doesn't want them anymore. :-) 

A tip that someone shared with me at one point was to feel free to mix
some blond burley with a stronger tobacco if I wanted a milder flavor -
I plan on picking up some blending tobaccos and blending my own.

Oh yes, a question, my main pipe has a bit that looks similar to a Peterson
but the smoke comes directly out the end of it instead of being directed 
towards the roof of your mouth - a very nice bit which I have not seen
since - anyone know what this kind of bit is called? I am looking for 
another pipe with a similar bit - I plan on trying a Peterson pipe over the
course of the summer. Also, I am looking for a nice pipe rack - I may 
wind up building my own as well as continuing to haunt antique stores.

Well - as someone who doesn't tend to write long messages this certainly 
seems to have become one. Thank and it's great to be back!

ADMIN: As many members have noticed, the Web site has been down for
much of this week.  Our redoubtable Webmaster, Steve Beaty, has some
news on this (garnered from alt.smokers.pipes), which appears as the
first letter.  It's not Steve's fault, nor is it that of the site. And
hopefully, we won't leave our readers on the Web stranded for too much
longer!

And now, as the Solstice approaches and the warm weather has arrived,
join us in the backyard as we fetch a stick to scare the woodchuck and
a smoke to scare the mosquitoes...

The pipes page at <a href="http://www.pipes.org">http://www.pipes.org</a> will be down for a couple more days.

US Worst (U.S. West) was supposed to have our new T1 up on the 7th and my

From: sergio &lt;???????@???.???&gt;

Hello Steve,

        First of all, my congratulations on our PD. Is ine of the best
things in the Net, I always find good information and listen to very
interesting stories.

        I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, and have been a pipe smoker for 10
years now. Pipe smoking is not very common here, may be because of the very
hot weather. Things are starting to changing, it's becaming fashion here
people  smoking cigars. They just open a new shop near home, it's a little
too fancy for a serius smoker, but I can sit there and have my pipe in peace.
         I have 2 questions I would like to put to you and to any other expert:

        - A friend of mine give me an old Italian Whitehall briar pipe, with
the inside of the bowl made in meerschaum. The pipe have never been used,
bur I found one litle fissure, crack, in the meerschaum. What can I do to
repair it? Can I smoke it anyway or put it in the shelf?

        - I also had a very old pipe, actually only the bowl, that was found
in escavations in the northest of Brasil. I was told that it is a XVII
century old dutch pipe, made in terracota, from the period the dutch invade
this part of Brasil. I would like to try to rebuid the pipe. Do you know any
book that could help me in this job? Or some one that could do it?

        Thank you in advance for the help.

[ Meerschaum-lined pipes aren't usually very valuable; I'd suggest you
just smoke and enjoy.  As for the Dutch pipe, repairing it would
probably be impossible, but perhaps a skilled ceramicist could make
you a copy.  As It Happens, we might have some expertise in the group
on reproducing antique clays... -S. ]

Dear Steve: When ever I'm out in public smoking my pipe, people comment on
how nice it smells and then they go on too tell me about there grandfather
or uncle who smoked a pipe,and how much they enjoyed the smell of the
tobacco.  This makes me happy, to think that my smoke awakens memories of
forgotten and missed loved ones. The sense of smell is a wonderful thing.

<a name="4">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #217 -- June 3, 1996</a>

Hope this is the right address to write to : I've never written.

I have subscribed for about a year, and have enjoyed the issues; but, I 
never supposed I had a thing to contribute, so I kept my counsel.  I'm a 
27-yr.-old grad. student in philosophy at McMaster University here in 
un-lovely Hamilton.  I've smoked a pipe for about five years; and, I have 
to admit, I have no time for the snobs who insist that my liking for a 
well-made aromatic is bad taste.

Anyway, this is a comment on the following, from the June 3 issue:

&gt; "Although we had already signified our intention of becoming American
&gt;  citizens, Arkady, as you would expect, wanted the farewell Russian
&gt;  performance carried out with proper dignity, as would befit the honor
&gt;  of a great empire.  He rehearsed our Russian soldiers with great care
&gt;  in the lowering of our flag and I helped mend torn uniforms and
&gt;  supervised the polishing of shoes.  I must say that our troops looked
&gt;  pipe-clay neat when Arkady and I were finished".
&gt;  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

&gt;I assume that this refers to the bright white appearance of a clay pipe 
&gt;when new or after being burned clean in a fireplace (as described in The 
&gt;Ultimate Pipe Book).

&gt;[ Also, back in the days of sailing ships, pipe clay was applied to
&gt;the ropes (or lines or halliards or hawsers or whatever) to whiten
&gt;them for special occasions. -S. ]

What is fascinating about this, actually, is that 18th century military 
practice was to use pipe-clay for all sorts of whitening uses.  The 
British army (I don't know about the Russians) regulars used to use wet 
pipe clay on their breeches in order to make them white.  Naturally, this 
had some unhappy effects in cold weather, such as was often seen here in 
Canada.  As a result, some Canadian regiments adopted grey trousers as 
uniform, instead.

Ah, for the days when one could expect a ready supply of pipe-clay in the 
neighbourhood...

<a name="5">Subject: Eatin' Park</a>

I everyone, haven't written in a while cause I don't get to e-mail much now
that school is out for summer break.
        I live in South Central PA and just wanted to make a note to
everyone who knows about or eats in Eatin' Park restaurants.  They've got a
smoking section, but on the menu it states that they must ask patrons to
refrain from smoking cigars or pipes in the smoking section.  Cigars I may
agree.  I enjoy a fine cigar very much, but the concentrated smoke can
travel far and be overwhelming.  But I've never met a person that would
prefer cigarette smoke over that of a fine pipe tobacco.  A sad state of
affairs indeed.

P.S.  I've never actually tried a puff, I wonder if they'd say anything???
P.P.S.  Thanks again Steve for the wonderfull job you do every month.

<a name="6">Subject:       Re: Pipes Digest #217 -- June 3, 1996</a>

Interesting post by "bigchris;" I should have 
thought of that myself. If indeed small amounts
of the coumarin/warfarin in pipe tobacco are
absorbed into the bloodstream, it could be beneficial;
Warfarin, trademarked as Coumadin, is indeed an
anticoagulant used to treat heart/stroke patients.

What I still would like to know, though, is whether
Wigand is just plain full of it, or whether there
is any coumarin in pipe tobacco.

Also, on a completely different topic, I had always
thought that the (Italian) pipe carver Lorenzo Tagliabue,
whose pipes are known as Lorenzo, had passed away
10 or so years ago. Yet, I just bought another
Lorenzo - great value for the money, incidentally.
Is my info wrong, or did someone take over from
Tagliabue?

Hi Steve, and all other pipe-smokers...

	I've thoroughly enjoyed reading PD for the last few months, and 
figured it was time to write in.  Besides, I have a motive.

	I am a grad. student in Santa Barbara California and have been 
smoking pipes for a dozen or so years.  Having recently moved to the West 
coast I left my smoking pals behind and have met no pipe smokers here.  I 
have also seen no mention anywhere of a pipe group--briar friers, 
etc.--and am interested in getting one together if one does not already 
exist.  So if there are any SB area pipe smokers, please e-mail me at the 
address below.

	Thanks for a great digest.

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]
 
Try using the computer tool cases that you can get at any computer
retailer. They come in sizes which will hold two pipes to as many as five
or six. They have elastic bands which will usually fit the pipes, and they
are probably cheaper than the gun cases or shaving kits. They don't have as
much cushioning, but you can put a thin piece of foam in the middle. Nice
zippered cases. The tools are a bonus.

<a name="9">Subject: Heloise on the Pipes Digest?</a>

 Hi, Steve...I've been subscribing to the digest for about a year now, but I've
never contributed anything before.  Well, I figure it's about time.

 Towards the end of the last issue, someone mentioned that they were looking
for a good pipe rack, or thinking of making one.  I have a couple of racks
which I picked up at a flea market, but one is rather bruised and battered, and
the other only holds four pipes (and neither of them really accomidates my big
Nording freehand.  Also, I've always thought that pipes are
better displayed as they often are in a smoke shop, hung somehow horizontally
on the wall.

 So, I set out to make myself a decent but inexpensive (hey, I'm just out of
college) pipe rack, and I got one together for about $6.00.  I went to the
local lumber/home improvement store and picked up three things:  A sawtooth
picture hanger, a small package of black 1 5/8" panel nails, and a ready-made
10" X 24" wood shelf (I bought one of those _really_ cheap particle board ones 
that's covered with a decent looking faux wood grain, but for a little more you
could always buy the real thing).

 I nailed the hanger to the top &amp; back of the shelf. (holding it vertically,
although I suppose you could do it either way)  Then, taking each pipe I wanted
to put on this rack, I plotted where it would be necessary to prop the pipe up
so it would sit securely, and put a nail in at each point... for bents I used
one nail on either side of the bottom of the bowl, and one under the end of the
mouthpiece, and for straights I used one nail under the bowl, one nail just
under the end of the mouthpiece, and one nail right near the point where the
top of the shank meets the bowl, making sure I could place &amp; remove the pipe
without its getting stuck.

 The black paint used on the nails that I found acts like a protective coating,
preventing the metal from potentially scratching the pipes.  And since the
nails have very small heads you hardly notice them at all, so it doesn't look
too much like a cubscout's first wood project.  I'm very pleased with the
results... hung on the wall my pipes are much better displayed than standing on
a rack in the corner, and the dark woodgrain behind them complements the briar
bowls very nicely.  

 Well, I hope that's of interest of someone... I figured it would be more so
here than in Heloise's column in the paper. :{)&gt;

[ Sounds workable, Andy; plastic-coated cup hooks might do well, too.
BTW, I've had a woodworking question about pipe racks for some time
now.  A couple of my racks have a top piece with C-shaped
indentations, routed along one edge.  How does one drill the
indentations or rout the edge without excessive tear-out? -S. ]

Hi everybody,
as a new member to the list, and an inexperienced pipe-smoker, i want to 
ask two questions:
 ...could somebody advise me on the best way to clean meerschaum pipes and 
the second one is what is the best pie/tabacco shop known to you in the 
new york city?..if anybody could get me some information on either of 
those, i would appreciate it very much...

<a name="10">Subject: Meerschaum</a>

Illustrious moderator and fellow pipe types!

        While referencing Kraus and Slawson's _Gems and Gem Materials_ and
Kraus, Hunt, and Ramsdell's _Mineralogy_ on an unrelated topic, I came
across some information regarding sepiolite - the mineral which my fellow
Digesters (now there's an odd turn of phrase &lt;G&gt;) recognize as meerschaum.
I hope it will prove of interest.  (And I beg forgiveness if it's been
posted before!)

1.  Everyone knows that meerschaum translates to "sea-foam."  Why?  Due to
its low specific gravity (1-2 times the weight of water) and considerable
porosity, it will commonly float.  Romantic allusions aside, this seems the
most plausible of all the explanations I have seen for the name.

2.  The famed deposits at Esksehir are secondary deposits.  The meerschaum
originated elsewhere.  (Incidentally, it's also found in Spain, the Grecian
archipelago, Morocco, Moravia, Utah, California, New Mexico, and
Pennsylvania.  So I suppose it's possible to have an American meerschaum pipe!)

3.  Most sepiolite is a product of the weathering of serpentine and
magnesite (which is in turn the result of the alteration and carbonation of
magnesium minerals from igneous and metamorphic rocks).  Some is also the
result of the alteration of impure opal containing considerable magnesium -
radiolaria have tests (shells) of opaline silica, so they may be the
"millions of tiny sea creatures" described in numerous sales brochures - but
I would suspect that sepiolite from this source would tend to be finely
disseminated in sediments, rather than nodular.  (I'll admit that the
"millions of tiny sea creatures" story has the greater romantic appeal, both
from a sales and tell-your-friends point of view.)  I don't have specific
information on the source of the Esksehir deposits, but I am looking.  I'll
talk to some clay mineralogists of my acquaintance and follow up later.

Hi Gang!

I just wrote to give you guys a little something to chat about!  Sort of...

Well, anyway, I smoked a cigar today.  It was nothing fancy, just a Phillie
Sweet.  I must say that it is excellent because they put sugar on the tip and
it is very sweet, hence the name.  

I was going to take the bus home, but since it was a beautiful day I decided
to walk home.  What better a thing to do at a moment like this but to light
up.  So I took out my Phillie Sweet and lit up.  I truly enjoyed it on the
two-mile walk home.  

I seem to be getting off on a rant here, so let me explain.

Dear Steve,

Thanks for my first copy of the Digest, #217, and to see myself listed among
the new members. Wonderful to find something really interesting to read
among all the professional crud in the mailbox!

I am writing in response to

&lt;From: "Carl Hurley" &lt;?????@???.???.???.???&gt;
&lt;Subject: dunhill pipes in England&gt;

One place that is a must for me when I go to London, or as we say where I
live, *Go up to Town*, is Smith's Snuff Shop in Charing Cross Road, half way
between Cambridge Circus and Leicester Square. I am always amazed at the
amount of stock he manages to get into such tiny premises. One thing that
Carl should be able to pick up there is a copy of a gem of a quarterly mag
produced by the association of independent tobacconists of Great Britain,
which contains the addresses of all their members. Have a great trip, Carl!

I have to say that my favourites all seem to be Petersons. Of the sixteen
pipes on my desk, (more in drawers!), 12 are of that ilk, 10 from Dublin and 2
from the Rosslare factory. I do have a Ropp, a Savinelli and a Big Ben as a
minimal counterweight. My absolute favourites are the Hand Mades, but they are
so big that it really takes two to smoke them - one to hold and one to puff.

My Father smoked a pipe, as had his, and for my sixteenth birthday I was
given a pound (money) and sent to see a friend of his who was a tobacconist,
to buy a kit. His words were that he knew I smoked cigarettes, (how on earth
did he know?), and if I had to smoke, I would bloody well smoke a pipe. I'm
53 now and have been a pipe smoker pretty much exclusively for the last
twenty. I remember some of the good-natured ridicule I got as a youngster -
*You'll fall off the end of that!* and so on. But I am extremely pleased
that I perservered and did not get a bad cigarette habit..... Anyway, for my
pound, I got a reject pipe, an ounce of Will's Cut Golden Bar, a box of
matches and a pipe knife ... and six pence change. (There were 240 pennies
to the pound in them far off days).

I picked up a little on the availability of Copes Escudo, which I have
smoked and enjoyed from time to time. One of my Dad's complaints was that
Copes had withdrawn his preferred smoke, High Card, and that must have been
fifty years ago. My tastes vary, but are usually drawn from Gawith Hoggarth
of Kendal's list. I do like to mix it up with the occasional pipe of Black
Cavendish, although I could not smoke that all the time.

Enough of my drivel. Thanks again for a truly enjoyable mailing.

Regards and lang may your lumb reek.

&lt; A new friend (made at the Port Royal shop in Toledo, OH) introduced me to
Balkan Sobranie.  I simply can't get enough of this right now but I know this
will change.  I also enjoy Dunhill's My Mixture #???. 

I, too, enjoy Balkan Sobranie, both the Original Smoking Mixture and the
Luxury Blend. Maybe the Dunhill mixture is 965, my absolute favorite --
though I prefer it out of the tin instead of in bulk, a problem here in
Atlanta. I heard from one Arizona tobacconist that Sobranie was being dropped
by the distributor, and then on the web that Sasieni (sp? Sorry) was picking
it up. I'd really like the straight dope on that situation. But may I also
suggest to Steve Hahn the McClelland's Personal Reserve Series -- like Bombay
Court and Bombay Extra. Most fine English blends. You used to be able to get
them from Nikos Levin at NML Pipes Direct, who I noticed join the list. (I'm
a satisfied customer of his father, Barry, and I'm sure Nikos is carrying on
the fine tradition. My condolences, Nikos.)

Next on this long letter, I'm new to Atlanta, moving from Arizona, and while
I've found adequate tobacconists, I have not found enough cohorts in crime to
enjoy a bowl with (or an occasional cigar, for that matter.) Don't want to
make this a personals ad, (they scare me! Who answers those things?) but
would like to know of some Atlanta-based clubs or hangouts where some folks
like me might gather for a smoke and a drink (Hey, I'm happily married with
our first on the way, but my lovely wife, while tolerant, doesn't partake in
our fine hobby.) I'm a journalist, a bit on the youngish side, quickly
approaching 30, and like to pair my English tobacco with fine English ales.

On Tim Ramsay's talks of finally finding an acceptable aromatic, I'm kind of
partial to George Washington from Cincinnati Tobacco. Story is, or I was told
by someone anyway, that someone researched the mixture that Washington gave
his troops as rations, which I thought was kind of neat. A good story, even
if it isn't true!

Thanks for another great Pipes Digest!  I really enjoy the letters from other 
digest readers, and pick up on their experiences.  I've been smoking pipes 
since 1968, a small but proud collection of  Dunhill, Charatan,Radice, 
Peterson, Barling, Caminetto, Castello, Sasieni, and Ascorti.  I am 
particularly fond of the Radice and Caminetto (pre and post founders 
production).

I have moved from aromatic to English over the years.  Lately, I have been 
smoking the Esoterica selections and those of Butera (who is also the importer 
of Esoterica) who also lives in Houston.

Thanks for the pipe cleaning info in a previous newsletter regarding 
Everclear.  I have cleaned/reconditioned several pipes by removing the bit, 
plugging the shank, and inserting a piece of paper towel in the bowl, then 
saturating the paper towel with Everclear.  Two days later the tars have 
leeched into the paper towel and the bowl is sweet and clean.

<a name="15">Subject: Swallowing</a>

Hi Steve,

I found this little piece of wisdom in your pipe-smoking FAQ

"You may find the pipe getting a little juicy as you smoke. To avoid
this, try to keep your mouth dry as you smoke, and avoid swallowing."

While the idea is clear, the underlying principles leave me a bit 
puzzled, especially the "avoid swallowing" part. I do seem to produce a 
lot of saliva when I smoke. Swallowing it seems to be the thing to do, 
although it does sometimes ressults in a slightly irritated oesophagus (I 
guess the liquid does carry some of the nasty stuff). The other solutions 
are to drool or spit it out, neither of which strike me as being elegant 
or approriate. Any advice or ideas would be welcome.

<a name="18">Subject: Thanks, New address et al.</a>

Hi Steve,

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

Is this the right place to send pipe-digest related mail?

Now the boring bit is over, on to pipe matters:

Thanks for subscribing me to the pipesmokers digest; so far I have
found it most enjoyable and informative!

I am effectively a new pipesmoker, and have a query either for yourself
or the digest readers, but first let me introduce myself.

I am now 30 years old; since my pre-teen years I have loved both the
smell of pipe tobacco, (in the jar, and when someone else smoked it)
and just the *idea* of smoking a pipe. Maybe JRR Tolkien had something
to do with this :)

My first encounter with a pipe was at university, with a very cheap
"second", a "mild" aromatic blend, and no guidance.  It was not an
experience that I will easily forget: my disappointment at the lack of
taste and my charred tongue ensured that I did not touch a briar again
for several years.

But the aroma and mystique still beckoned, and so I tried again. And
again. And again...

My second and subsequent encounters all started and ended in much the
same way, as the first,  with the exception that I was buying better
briars, and milder &amp; lighter tobaccos, in the hope that this would
help.

The result of this was that 3 years ago during a major clear-out of the
house, I discovered that I had a collection of 11 pipes, including a
GBD and a Peterson, none of which had been smoked more than a couple of
times.

I decided to try again, but this time, sought the advice of my local
tobacconist, who gave me a dark aromatic (a German Black Cherry) and a
copy of the Pipesmokers' Welcome guide (a free yearly publication in
Britain, produced by the Pipesmokers' Council), which set me on the
right track as far as packing and lighting were concerned.

Finally! 
I could smoke a pipe without it feeling as though I were sucking on a
blow-torch! The room-aroma was fantastic! Even my wife-to-be liked it.
How I envied her, that she could appreciate the smell without having to
pop out in to the garden for a few seconds every so often! But, I was
still not getting much taste, and so gradually I smoked less and less,
until without noticing I had stopped altogether.

Two years went by. We had a daughter. We moved house.

While unpacking the millionth box, I found my pipe collection!

So once more, off I trudged to the (new) local tobacconist. I returned
with more advice and not an aromatic, but Rattray's Red Rapparee.

Though at first I found it a bit hot, there was that un-mistakable
quality I had sought after for so long: flavour! (I'm British and
that's how WE spell it :)

Spurred on by this new experience, and encouraged by my tobacconist, I
persisted, and now both my mouth, and my briars are broken in. Bliss!
Joy! Rapture! Ahemmm, sorry to go on but I have been waiting for this
day for over ten years :))

Anyway, finally on to my question. (Wake up there at the back! :)

I understand the importance of "cake" in a briar for a cool, dry smoke,
but what exactly is cake?

Is it a (gradually thickening) layer of charred wood, which as it is
trimmed will enlarge the original bore of the bowl?

Or, is it a (gradually thickening) deposit inside the walls of the
bowl, which if left un-trimmed will eventually reduce the original bore
of the bowl?

The reason that I am asking is because I seem to have quite a bit of
the later, which resembles a tar-like deposit. If it is tar, I guess I
ought to scrape it all out, and clean my pipes more often, but I don't
want to do that until I am sure it is not cake.

Apologies for the excessive length of this missive: when I lurk, I
lurk; when I stop I do so with a vengance!

Smoke in peace, 

Mike Bardzinski

[ Cake is the former: the charred remains of the leaves you have sacrificed to
the great god Nick O'Teen. It's probably best to keep it at about a 1-mm
thickness. The briar itself should never burn, after the pipe is broken
in. -S. ]

Steve, I hope you don't mind if I share some of the exciting details of the
OPC Sept. 14 swap/sell pipe show--pipes only; no cigars--with you and the
Digest readers.  This promises to be a really exciting event, and we'd like
as many people as possible to make plans to be there.
 
With room for 60-65 tables, we have already rented 42 and have a good shot
at a full house.  So far, several pipe shops, numerous individuals, Nikos
Levin of NML Pipes and Bob Hamlin of PCAA, and pipe makers Tim West, Steve
Weiner, Steve and Roswitha Anderson, and Lee von Erck have all committed to
attending.  There will be thousands of pipes as well as great quantities of
pipe-related items (tobacco, literature, etc., etc.) available for purchase
and possible trade.
 
With a table rent of only $25 ($30 after July 1), most of the money we make
each year to continue operating comes from our $1 a ticket raffle.  We
already have lots of tobacco and other stuff pledged for the raffle, but
I'll just enumerate the pipes pledged so far: a Tim West, a Dunhill
Chestnut bamboo shank Group 5 pot, a Bob Everett, a Kirsten, an S&amp;R, an
older GBD unsmoked Virgin, a David Jones Regency, a von Erck, a Mark Tinsky
American, an unspecified Dunhill, a Steve Weiner and a (probably) Brebbia.
There will be more.
 
But that's not all.  The Dunhill Chestnut is now in the hands of Chris
Hill, wife of OPC member and artist Pat Hill.  Chris is a jewelry designer,
and, in conjunction with the OPC, which is paying for the materials, she is
making a solid sterling silver fitted case for the pipe.  This will be the
last item in the 4:30 raffle, and I expect the interest will be intense.
You don't have to be present at the raffle, but you have to buy your
tickets at the show.
 
OPC membership now stands at 132 from 22 states and Canada, plus one in
England.  Anyone interested in receiving a show flyer or signup sheet,
please contact me.  And, as always, I will send a comp copy of our
increasingly large newsletter to anyone who thinks they might be interested
in becoming a member.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

[ Ooh! Aah! That raffle item should definitely spark some interest, I'd
say!  -S. ]

<a name="21">Subject: Kudos to McClelland and Butera...</a>

Steve,

Over the past few months, I have been experimenting with the McClelland 
and Butera Pipe Co. blends (including Esoterica Tobacciana).  Instead of 
product reviews, I would prefer to honor these companies with some 
public recognition for their blatant obsession with producing and/or 
marketing top-quality products ONLY.  It's a shame these aren't public 
companies, since they have successfully and skillfully established 
market niches and should profit in what can only become a stronger 
market in the future as more and more cigar smokers come to realize that 
$5 for a one-time smoke is an obscenity.  Of course, McClelland and 
Butera face some price sensitivity themselves, since their blends are 
indeed more expensive than most.  But, one should carefully consider 
that the per-smoke price of pipe tobacco remains a genuine bargain and 
when you amortize the pleasure you receive over the time it takes to 
consume the entire contents of a tin, the price of the McClelland/Butera 
blends is just a few pennys more per-smoke than cheaper blends.  In 
today's grossly over-hyped cigar market, a dollar here or there 
per-smoke is nothing, while many pipe smokers seem intimidated by paying 
a few more pennys per-smoke for a quality tinned blend.  Go figure!!  
Are there plenty of other good blends out there for less money?  Yes.  
But, are there other blends that use super-high quality leaf, are as 
painstakingly manufactured and are as carefully blended and packaged?  
No.  Try these blends....quality remains the only bargain.

Hi Tim,

(Steve: I started writing this reply to Tim, but thought that some
parts of it might be of interest to the rest of the Digest readers, please
include/edit as you see fit)

I read your posting to the Pipe Smokers digest with some interest, as
it is very similar to my own experience: I too started with aromatic
blends, but have moved to English blends.  Red Rapparee is a favourite
of mine, and I after this tin, I shall start working my way through the
rest of the Rattray's range.

As far as McLintock is concerned, they do quite a variety of aromatics:
Black Cherry, Blackberry, &amp; Apricot are some that come to mind, but they
do many more. I have only tried the Black Cherry of theirs, and it is
now one of the very few aromatics that I enjoy; however I have added
Blanc des Blancs to my list of tobaccos to try :)

If you are interested, the AITS Tobacco Index  which now available
on-line through the Pipe Digest WWW page has a complete list.  This
index is the most comprehensive list I have seen of tobaccos available
in Britain. If you cannot find them in your neck of the woods, there
are a number of tobacconists in the UK who will do mail order. One of
these is Edward McGahey, the guy who compiled the list.

One tobacco that I have tried recently is Craven Mixture, which is a very
pleasing mix of matured virginias and aromatic tobaccos.  It is not the
easiest tabak to find, but I think it is making a come-back. Appart
from being a very old blend, made for the Earl of Craven during the
last century, it is also the "Arcadia mixture" referred to by both  J.M
Barrie (in "My Lady Nicotine" I think?), and Sherlock Holmes (I forget
which case, but I can find out if any one is interested).

	I have an idea. How about taking all the past issues of The Digest- add
some scanned photos of pipes- etc and make a CD-ROM of info on pipes for us new
folk. Maybe a small search engine for the issues- just a general information
source.

	Since the Digest is 'Not for profit', Let one of our commerical
sources foot the main bill(or course ads for them and others)- then a
small fee of $5.00 to $10.00 for the CD. I know CDs can be produced for
$3-4 each, in numbers of 1500-2000. I noticed the Digest was going to
over 2200.

	I know this would be some work, must be about the same as a Web
page, and would provide a great source for new people.

	Food for thought. The Digest is wonderful. Thanks for all your
time and effort to further the cause. Great Job.

company and maybe could send me a short note.

Thank you and best wishes

Hi John / Steve

In PD #216 John said:

&gt; 2.  Many of the cavendish tobaccos I've tried impart a stinging or
&gt; bitter sensation on the back of my tongue and throat, especially when
&gt; smoked heavily.  Which tobacco leaf actually causes this effect?  I
&gt; suspect maybe some sort of Virginia tobacco, because some of the
&gt; blends which exhibit this boast flavorings with a Virginia base.  The
&gt; Blatter Reserve I like so much gives no such problem.  Blatter Reserve
&gt; is a very dark color... does this mean it lacks Virginia?  I don't
&gt; like this "peppery" sensation and would like to know which tobacco I
&gt; need steer clear of to avoid it.

This may be a coincidence, but, I recently purchased some pure Perique,
for blending with other tobaccos. Despite my tobacconist's warnings to
the contrary, I tried a bowlful "neat"; my wife said the room-aroma was
very nutty and chocolatey, which was to some extent mirrored in the
taste; but the overwhelming sensation was of pepper at the back of my
tongue &amp; throat; I had to stop before I was 1/3 way through the bowl.
Sure enough a drink took the sensation away. Maybe the C&amp;D's "Dark
Chocolate" you mentioned uses Perique for the chocolate (which I find
is quite prominent with Perique, even "in the jar").

I'd be interested to hear of other experiences with Perique.

breakdown lane and rolling on the Information Supercollider.  Thanks
to Steve Beaty and Vince Calloway for their support during the crisis,
and see Steve's letter below.

And welcome to our "once in a blue moon" issue, for June 30 is a "blue
moon" (the second full moon in a calendar month, at least in some time
zones.)  So, if you can see the moon (which I can't; it's been raining
all day), take a little while to light up and contemplate.

        a couple of updates:

        1) the web page is back up and working.
        2) there were several small glitches due to the move and i'd like to
thank people for pointing them out to me.  searching and subscribing should
be working again.
        3) i've reset the counter at the bottom of the page to reflect both
changes in the web counting method and the moving to the new site.
        4) the old address at tacoma.net is no longer working.  update those
pointers if you have them!

        thanks to everyone (especially Vince Calloway, who provides the site
free of charge to us all) who helped in this transition!

[ Re: Pipe-claying various military items in past centuries ]

&gt; Ah, for the days when one could expect a ready supply of pipe-clay in the
&gt; neighbourhood...

So did they carry a supply of fresh pipe clay on the ships in order to make
their own pipes when out on patrol at sea for several years?  Or did they use
the remains of old ground up broken pipes for their source of pipe clay for
whitening purposes? 

Happy smoke rings,

John

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipe Clay (fwd)</a>

[ Quote from above letter. -S. ]

It is not precisely true that ships would be on patrol for several years, 
since part of the point of having an Empire was to have possesions in all 
corners of the globe; that way, there'd be lots of places to stop to get 
fresh water, extra rum rations, etc.

Note, too, that most of the time neither sailors nor army regulars 
had to be in "full dress".  Generally, inspections would not occur every 
day; and, I've seen some evidence to suggest that British Army regulars 
were not required to change their shirts except on Wednesday and Sunday.  
"Shorts" (i.e. underwear) were not issued; the shirts merely had long 
tails, which were generally tied between the legs.

Probably there were supplies of pipe-clay available wherever a regiment 
went; there were always hangers-on who could make a few fast bucks by 
selling goods to the soldiers.  But given the hygene of the men, 
"pipe-clay neat" may not have been terribly neat at all!

Sweet smoke,
A.

<a name="6">Subject: Pipe Digest #218 response</a>

Steve,
Just wanted to take a minute to respond to a query by Sergio Jordao in PD
#218 about really old clay pipes.
During the 18th and early 19th centuries, a lot of clays were locally made.
Now these weren't the fine white clay churchwardens that you'll often see in
Colonial recreations, but thick bowled 'working' pipes, often made from
local clay. They were usually very short with no stem to speak of. A friend
of mine in college gave me one that he'd dug up near Lynchburg, Va. It was
of local red clay, and had, as I recall, a floral design on the bowl. The
general practice was to attach a hollow reed, and use that as the stem. I'll
bet the pipe Sergio was given has a similar history. If Sergio decides to
smoke it, or even display it, he could probably fashion a rustic reed stem.
Thanks again for providing a wonderful forum for followers of the pipe.
Regards, Travis

<a name="7">Subject: Swallowing While Smoking</a>

In Pipes Digest #218, Eric Francoeur said...

&gt; I found this little piece of wisdom in your pipe-smoking FAQ
&gt; 
&gt; "You may find the pipe getting a little juicy as you smoke. To avoid
&gt; this, try to keep your mouth dry as you smoke, and avoid swallowing."

&gt; While the idea is clear, the underlying principles leave me a bit 
&gt; puzzled, especially the "avoid swallowing" part. I do seem to produce a 
&gt; lot of saliva when I smoke. Swallowing it seems to be the thing to do, 
&gt; although it does sometimes ressults in a slightly irritated oesophagus (I
&gt; guess the liquid does carry some of the nasty stuff). The other solutions are
&gt; to drool or spit it out, neither of which strike me as being elegant or
&gt; approriate. Any advice or ideas would be welcome.

I take the suggestion to mean that you should avoid swallowing while the stem 
of the pipe is actually in your mouth.  It's sort of hard to avoid getting 
saliva into the pipe stem in that situation.

Happy smoke rings,

John

[ Thanks, Kevin!  We also had favorable comments on the CD-ROM from

would like to produce a CD-ROM commercially, please give us a yell.  I
think there's some potential for a product here, especially for the
burgeoning cigar market. I would be glad to help out, provided that a
portion of the profits is given to an agreeable charity (perhaps Cap
Cure), the addresses are stripped, and it doesn't turn into a black

 Actually, I have all the past Pipes Digests on my hard drive.  But I'd love 
to see a CD-ROM that included pictures (.gif or .jpg) of pipes and cigars; 
 perhaps even some clip-art (.pcx, etc.) of pipes, cigars, and pipe &amp; cigar

Hi folks,

I just found Pipes Digest #218 in my mail, and I just overflew it, and
I found Grant Porter's message, and I would like to declare my
interest in such a CD-ROM, because I'm still a pipe novice, not yet
clean from cigarette smoking, and I have loaded down from Compuserve
onto my harddisk all issues of the Pipes Digest starting with #132,
and via my file finder I've found many answers on my questions, which
I didn't find in my books. Sometimes I simply start reading old
issues; it's interesting, specially as I see, that other people
have/had the same problems and unanswered questions as I (is that
correct English??).  So, I would immediately buy a CD-ROM with the
older issues of the PD and eventually some general informations about
pipes, tobacco...

Smoke in peace,

<a name="12">Subject: CD-ROM, Ireland, cigars&amp;pipes, and the meaning of life...</a>

Dear Steve,

I enjoy reading PD; it always breaks up a boring business day, that's for 
sure.  As for your straw poll, I would find a CD-ROM with that wealth of 
information useful.

Now on to some personal matters.  I subscribed to PD more for the cigar aspect 
rather than the pipe subject matter, but I have to say that I have become 
interested in pipe smoking now.  My wife is travelling to Ireland next month 
and she asked what I would like her to bring me back.  Knowing that Peterson 
is there, I suggested she bring me back a Peterson pipe.  I have not smoked a 
pipe before (not really) and I was wondering if this would be a good way to go 
about getting started.  Is there a Peterson shop in any of the big cities in 
Ireland or would you just go to any tobacco shop?  Any help in this area, 
particularly by the Irish members of PD would be gratefully appreciated.

On a somewhat related note, I have a corn-cob pipe (Missouri Meerschaum) that 
was given to me as a gag gift a couple of years ago: is that worth smoking?  
Would it put me off of pipe smoking or would it serve as a good training 
device for my Peterson (and make me appreciate it more!).

I've been smoking cigars since a trip to Amsterdam in the late eighties when I 
picked up a Cuban Montecristo on a lark and was enchanted by the incredible 
flavor.  I never smoked cigarrettes and I always thought that a cigar was just 
a big cigarrette; how wrong I was.  I've enjoyed many a cigar since, although 
the Montecristos are few and far between because of our country's silly little 
embargo.  (Hopefully, a few of these might find their way into my humidor via 
Ireland!).

Keep up the good work, Steve.

Thanks,
Dave Tainer

[ Missouri Meerschaums are definitely worth smoking, though they don't
last forever.  I've been thinking about getting one of the "MacArthur"
types myself, for fun.  (Though I can't wear the Ray-Bans or the gold
braid!)  BTW, there were interesting articles about both the Missouri
Meerschaum Company and Douglas MacArthur in the current issue of
"Pipes and Tobacco." -S. ]

Hello Steve.  Thanks for adding me to the subscription list.  I enjoy 
reading the Digest very much.  In response to your recent query-I would be 
interested in obtaining a CD Rom of past issues, if it could be done at a 
reasonable cost.

Also could you, or anyone else help me to find out some information about a 
recent pipe I acquired.  It is  a Prebem Holm Hallmark H-2 Made in Denmark. 
 It is a very beautiful Freehand, rather on the large side that I recently 
picked up.  It smokes wonderfully and is a joy to hold as well.  I was 
quite pleased to add it to my smallish collection that also includes
Savinelli, Lorenzo, and Mastro de Paja.  I am particulary interested in 
finding out more regarding price, manufacture, etc...as well as detaild 
about the company and availability of others. 

Thank you very much for the Digest and your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

Bonjour Steve!

  This is my first post, I'm a 24 year old American ( Idaho), working
as a missionary/University teacher, in Switzerland for 6 months.  I've
been smoking pipes and cigars about 5 years, and it just keeps getting
better.  My pipe collection is slowly growing... I've got about 8,
including an SMS meershchaum, a couple of hand-made Lithuanian and
Russian novelties, and a nice English BBS that I quite enjoy, but my
current favorite is a great Mullins &amp; Westley bulldog that I picked up
in London last month.  What an adventure it's been scouring Eruope for
the best tobacconists!  My current favorite is "Alexandre Senn,
Tabacs-Cigares" on the Rue de Bourg in Lausanne, Switzerland.  Great
selection, both pipes and cigars.  (the prices for Cubans over here
are obscenely low compared to the States...  but...  Cubans in the
States?.... well, you didn't hear it from me).

Anyway, the reason I'm writing is in response to :

&lt;From: "Carl Hurley" &lt;?????@???.???.???.???&gt;
&lt;Subject: dunhill pipes in England&gt;

I didn't read the actual post, just another response in PD #218, so
forgive me if this is redundant: I spent two days in London last
month, just passing through on my way back to Switzerland, and went on
a treck for the best tobacconists.  Unfortuantely, I was there over a
weekend, and most were closed, but I did find a small shop in Covent
Garden.  Very friendly, and helpful.  I bought a nice Bulldog there
for a fraction of what I'd have paid in the states.  But they also
have some very nice Dunhill and Savinelli's, for less than what you'd
actually have paid in the Dunhill shop.  (let's all just observe a
moment of silence in respect for the AMAZING humidor in the Dunhill
shop...  )  So, there you go.  don't know the address, but it's on the
north-west side of Covent Garden.  Hope this helps.

Smoke 'em if ya got 'em...

Steve,

Thanks for the subscription! I've been reading the Pipes Digest for several
years now, but never got around to signing up. Anyway, some quick news
about the situation regarding Balkan Sobranie. I read in the latest issue
(#218) that Balkan Sobranie was going to be discontinued. Well this news
seems correct. While down at my local tobacconist (Edleeze in Albany, NY),
I purchased a pouch of Balkan Sobranie Origibal Mixture and was told by the
owner of the shop that this line of pipe tobacco was being removed from the
U.S. market.

She told me the reason was two fold. First, the rise in tobacco taxes and
importation costs have made it difficult to continue to import. Second, the
rising number of law suits the company has been involved in. What these law
suits are all about? I don't know! But I do know that if you like these
blends, you'd better buy up a good supply. It seems like the supply is
already starting to dry up. Once the current supply is gone, the only place
it will be available will be the United Kingdom and Canada. Maybe?????

I hope this news will help my fellow pipe smokers to stock up on this
blend. It's to bad that it has to come to this.

<a name="18">Subject: pipes and attitudes</a>

Greetings from the land of the midnight sun to all the pipe smokers of P.D.

Again some time has elapsed since my latest mail to this list. I see the
number of subscribers to be already more than 2.200 aficionados of the
pleasures of Nicotiana Tabacum in its various forms. 

We are today an endangered species. Most governments and fellow human beings
see us as class-B citiziens. The attitude toward us is growing more and more
negative and hostile every day. Non smoking people have recognized the risks
of so called passive smoking very well indeed, at least here in Scandinavia
and Northern Europe, even in the U.S.A., where smoking once was thought as a
typical characteristic of the American way of life.

In this group we see smoking as an interesting hobby, many of us even an
integral element in our attitude to life. We know the health risks but still
fill our pipes with heavy Latakia blends, enjoy the aroma and the beautiful
grain of old briar. Fellow citiziens are fully unaware of these esoteric
pleasures and the hidden knowledge therein. We are categorized to belong to
the stinking group of filthy smokers, which is endangering the "better
people's" healthy, towards immortality striving pursuits. Health has become
a new god of contemporary life in western societies. For many people it is
ununderstandable that for some persons there even may exist other values
than health. (Besides, what about the average expectancy of life among pipe
smoking American men compared with the non smokers?)
Despite all this, let us behave as considerate smokers when we interact with
these ignorant people :)

Okay, okay, now that I have got this burst out of my anxious heart I am
feeling better already. I must say that I am very grateful to Steve M. and
all the fellow smokers about this list, which even seems to have some
therapeutic value for its members :)

Lately I have been smoking C&amp;D's #507, Shandygaff. As Craig writes: "507 has
a generous portion of a mixture of Dutch type tobaccos with a little flavor.
It's about 1/4 Turkish with some Perique and cavendish cut burley thrown in
for good measure". Although it has no Latakia in it, I find Shandygaff quite
tasty, try it! I think that people who like #414, Oriental Silk, might find
it useful to experiment even with a sample of #507.

Now as I am a proud owner of two old Ben Wade freehands, I feel almost a
personal sorry and sadness about Preben Holm's untimely death.
 
If there are members, who are willing to abandon a Ben Wade, please contact
me (??????@???.??).

At the end of July I am starting again my annual three weeks' hiking and
fishing trip in the vidda of Lapland. (Remember the story of "A pipe
smoker's agony in the wilderness", in which I told about the terrible
situation of finding out that the main stock of pipe tobacco was
forgotten?). I think I must have a pound of some pressed blend with me this
time, because in pressed form the tobacco is handy in the rucksack. It goes
in a small space and does not dry as easily as loose tobak.

I'll tell about my trip in September, when the nights are again getting
darker here and my consumption of good pipe tobacco is increasing in spite
of the "better people's" disapproval.

Mr. Davis,

In the last issue of Pipes Digest you wrote:

&gt;From: Carl Davis &lt;????????@????????.????.???&gt;
&gt;Subject: Cigar Store II
&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if you knew of any place other than Thompson's that sells 
&gt;the Cigar Store II.  I found the Pipe's Digest that had the maker of the 
&gt;CigarStor (the original one) wrote to you and I tried to email that 
&gt;address but it did not work.  Thanks for any help you can provide. 

I make the CigarStor. Back around Christmas, we decided that a far improved,
more attractive, larger and more effective CigarStor could be made available
for about the same price as the original CigarStor. Hence the birth of
CigarStor II.

Well, to make a relatively long story short, we had some difficulty with
tooling which lived up to our expectations. We have been refining and are
finally at the point where an accaptable tool is complete.

The delay has been a great headache to us, as it has to Thompson. There are
many back orders for CigarStor II. We feel, however, that it is better to be
patient and produce quality than to ship inferior goods. I think you'll be
very pleased when you see CigarStor II.

Let me apologize again for the inconvenience. If you need any more
information about CigarStor II or need info about tobacconists which carry
our products, feel free to contact me.

Thanks,
Philip Burrus

First, a (second) unfortunate occurrence, with a question:
  What the heck does Dunhill put in "Royal Yacht?"  The tin tells me it's
"Exceedingly mild with a grand rich flavour."  I won't deny that it's tasty,
but on both occasions I've tried it I had to make a beeline for the
lavatory.  The first occasion I ascribed to a large pipe and a Bad Pipe Day.
This second problem I can only put down to the tobacco.  85% of the tin
left, and I don't dare go near it!

Second, a ray of sunshine:
  I remembered riding a bus twice a day past a shop in Royal Oak, Michigan
called the Malaga Pipe Company.  Seeing as this was almost twenty years ago
(and I didn't smoke a pipe then, being something like nine years old), I
figured that the shop had gone the way of all good things, but figured since
I was visiting family in Madison Heights last weekend, I'd drive by anyhow
and take a look.  To my surprise, the firm is still in the business (third
generation!) of making pipes, and a friendlier propreitor there never was.
(I grew up in the area, so we had a nice chat and remembered many of the
same things; we both bemoaned the "Ann Arborization" of Royal Oak.)  He
carries probably thirty-five bulk tobaccos and a smattering of tins.  I
purchased two of the Malaga pipes, and impressions follow:

        1.  A nice bent bulldog "first" in a reddish color.  A
larger-diameter tobacco hole than most bulldogs (which I prefer), and nice
mixed (mostly flame) grain, with a lucite bit.  Light and comfortable.
        2.  A "second," which I'd describe as a short prince.  This pipe is
beautifully (nearly straight) grained, with a natural finish.  Even with a
small sand pit or two, this piece of briar makes the green-eyed monster
evident in just about all the pipe types at my regular tobacconist in Toledo.

  And better yet, these are absolutely the driest pipes I own!  I'm still
breaking them in, and I have needed ONE pipe cleaner during a dozen smokes -
when a shred of leaf got into the draft hole of the "second".  Fully as dry
as my old Sasieni eight-dot.  Better than my Upshall.  Better than my
Savinellis.

  I haven't got the latest iteration of the Resource Guide, so here's the
address:
        Malaga Briar Pipe Co., Inc.
        1406 E. Eleven Mile Rd.
        Royal Oak, Michigan  48067
        (810) 542-5000

  I can only hope that (like many fine tobaccos) the Malaga pipe doesn't
fall victim to Herblock's Law.

It's been a while since I have had time to read any digests, but I
just read the last ten or so -- and here, in no particular order, are
my contributions and thoughts on what has gone before.  My apologies
for comments on topics long-dead.

Re:  Pipe smoking and flyfishing.  I am truly impressed with anybody 
who can successfully flyfish a stream and smoke a pipe at the same 
time.  I smoke pipes, and I flyfish (if you can call it that - I 
catch an awful lot of tree branches and other choice overhead 
obstacles) but I cannot imagine the hilarity that would ensue should 
I try to combine the two.  And unless I had the pipe on a zinger (a 
little cord thingy that you attach to your vest and whatever you 
don't want to drop in the stream, for you non-flyfishers) I would 
probably lose as many pipes as I do flies.  I don't think I could 
afford that.

Re: "pipies".  I've seen this one at least a few times reading 
through the digests, although it probably stood out more with the 
effect of reading several at one sitting.  I'm sure we can come up 
with something to call each other that's not quite so cutsie.  
Please, please, can we?

The digest has become a touchstone for me to the world of pipe 
smoking.  I realized how long it's been since I've smoked my pipes.  
And I realized that I miss it.  I appreciate the digest and all its 
submissions -- I've learned more than I would have guessed here.  
That reminds me.  I did have another topic.  A question, really:

As I haven't smoked in a while, all of my pipe tobacco currently 
looks and feels like little bags of tumbleweed clippings: bone dry 
bone bone dry.  Is there a good method for reconstituting tobacco 
that has been ignored by its owner?  If not, I won't be too upset - I 
don't have that much stuff on hand - and it would be a good excuse to 
go to the tobacconist...  (Gee, that's a nice-looking pipe - I really 
could use another pipe - I'm sure Katy won't notice one more in the 
rack)  For that matter, do I really need an excuse?

[ As long as the tobacco hasn't turned to powder, you can seal it in
an airtight container and apply a little bit of water every couple of
days until it has rehumidified.  Just run your hand under a faucet and
shake the water droplets onto the tobacco, thn re-seal. Thanks to
Craig, who told me that one.  -S. ]

<a name="24">Subject: Info for the resource guide and a few miscellaneous thoughts</a>

Dear Steve;

     I just downloaded your most recent Resource Guide and have a few items
which you may wish to add.

     First, in Denver, the best pipe, cigar and tobacco shop I have found is
"Prince Philip's Pipes and Tobaccos" in the Tamarac Square Shopping Mall
Telephone (303) 695 - 1959.  The tobacco selection is excellent and they have
a modest but good quality selection of pipes and cigars.  Also, they are the
home of the only Denver Cigar and Pipe Club I know of, The Knights of the
Mystic Leaf.  The Knights meet every few months for a gourmet dinner and
cigar sampling party at local restaurants.  The owner is trying to put a pipe
dinner together but has had little luck to this point in convincing pipe and
tobacco distributors to atttend a dinner like this.  I highly recommend
Prince Philip's and the Knights.

     The other item for your attention is that there used to be a fantastic
Pipe and Tobacconist Chain in Central New York called The Briar Route.  The
headquarters was in Syracuse and the owners, Chris Buffis and Jerry Miller,
really knew the tobacco business and kept the highest standards in their
shops.  They had an absolutely first rate pipe and tobacco selection.  I
don't know if they are still in business, but if so, they should definitely
be listed in your resource guide.  Perhaps if there are any subscribers to
Pipes Digest from Syracuse they could relate the current status of the chain
and give out an address.  I know I would sure like to find their address.

     By the way have you noticed the hypocracy that many fervent anti-smokers
have towards kids smoking.  I remember that, when I went to high scool in the
early '70's, one of the first things I was told by the teachers and
administrators was where the smoking area was.  All students, even the
non-smokers like I was, accepted that it was no big deal if their fellow
students smoked or not.  And everyone knew, even then, how "bad" the doctors
and the Surgeon General thought smoking was for their health. Now suddenly
these kids are twenty years older and the standards they lived under and
accepted are not good enough for their and my kids.  What hypocracy!  My 16
year old daughter smokes cigarettes and I have no problem with it.  Maybe
these people need to learn the meaning of the term consistency!

Take care and Happy Smoking!

Hi Gang:

I hope you will tolerate a little bandwidth usage for something that may 
not be of interest to everyone, but I figure it might a) encourage others 
to attend and/or b) encourage others to start a local group.

So: There were six of us in attendance.

Brief Summary: It was great! We plan to do it every Third Wednesday, at The 
Londonner in Addison. If you need meeting/direction details please email 
me.

Verbose Summary:

The six of us found each other fairly easily: We were the only ones walking 
around the pub with pipes in hand. (Oh and one Cigar). We gathered, we 
greeted and that was that for the formalities.

We swapped stories about our favorite/worst Tobaccoes, Pipes, beers, 
liquors, women^H^H^H^H^H^H, local/mailorder Tobacconists etc etc.

David Quisenberry brough some tobaccoes for all us to sample: Stanhope from 
C&amp;D, Dunbar from Esoterica. Yours truly showed off his latest aquisitions 
from the Dallas PCI show. (Aside: we unanimously agreed the show could have 
used more advertising, we hope to be able to help with that in the future 
-- but that may be a Pipe Dream :) )

It was fun to get confirmation that Pipe smokers truly are great people. 
Everybody was very friendly and pleasant.

Incidentals:

Turns out that not only do most of us read avidly, but we have some very 
similar tastesin authors and genres. There was a napkin writing incident 
which I promised not to bring up, so I won't :). If anyone knows Art 
Larson, and is in touch with him, please tell him he has a very charming 
daughter.

If any of y'all have any non-net friends in the area whom you think would 
be interested, please drop me their name and numbers. I would be more than 
glad to call them.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please let me know. 8D

U am sure I won't be the only one who gets this. The C part of the rack is
made by using either a spade bit or Forstner bit of 3/4 inch diameter in a
drill to make the holes. The board can be a narrow board, in which case you
leave it the way it is, and you have a hole to surround the bit, or you cut
it down the middle and you have two pieces.

Hi Steve

Happy to report completion of the two bowl pipe. ^The bowls are 1.5" high
and have a depthe of 1 1/4 ".
Overall length is about 7". ( with stem) Best of all the weight is under 2
oz and its quite comfortable to hold in the mouth. The pipe is virtually
flawless and I can finish naturally if that s ok . Pipe will darken as you
smoke it and will look better and better as its smoked. I chickened out  on
the real flat oval shank as I  ws afraid to hit an airhole. Its slightly
ovalled instead. Pipe sits flat also. Still have to make  murder bite stem
and polish. This may be the only pipe I ve ever made where I used files;
tools I had airlirly dismissed as woodcarving tools and not used by
pipemakers ! I needed them , however.

I SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAIL TO YOU MON.If you ll provide a snail address. I
mentioned it to Chet and he wants to see a pix. As i don t own a camera its
up to you to satisfy him if you so choose.

I was so glad about the pipeI undertook a chore(lesson) that I had been
putting off. This is that story:

Well this evening I did something completely different.  spent hours tying
knots. Yup knots. In fly fishing there are a couple of totaly nec. knots
you need to be able to tie while standing in a rushing torrent , over your
waist, wedging a 9' flexible fishing rod under your arm in the wind. You
are tying knots using clear line maybe the width of human hair. For someone
with good manual dexterity its not easy, fror someone as undextorous as I
am its near fuckin impossible. Sometimes i spent more time attempting to
tie than I do fishing . Most of the time I resort to just many regular
knots, like in shoe tying, not really recommended.

So yesterday I bought a little do - jiggy which was supposed to make knot
tying easy; it even has a video, which i didn t purchase, but did come with
a book.Time for a pipe!

I have been graced with the ability to catch footballs, hit raquet balls
and punch and kick people with a fair degree of success. However when it
comes to threading needles, soldering wires , and manipulating small
objects I m a total spazz.. I n order to make up for my natural
defeciencies I practiced tying knots all day with my little do jiggy. To
make a long tedious story short, after starting with string and tying then
moving to regular fishing line and finally to fly line I was able to learn
two knots in approx 4 hours.This is a major accomplishment for me. Sadly I
was only able to do thi under bright light, no wind, and calmly seated at a
table with both elbows conveniently anchored. Hardly the conditions I ll
encounter on the river sumarize above. Practice makes perfect!

We had some big T storms tonight. I kept the computer unplugged untl just
now. Had a nice, but slow dinner out. Lot of fog and mist out tonite.
Sunset where you could see it was pretty. Good nite MT

From: Steve Masticola (????????@???.???????.???)
<a name="29">Subject: 2-bowl experiences</a>

Hi, all,

As I put this issue of the Digest together, I'm breaking in an in-line
2-bowl pipe that Mark Tinsky (??@????.???) carved as a special order
for me.  I've been curious about both two-bowls and Mark's work for
quite some time, and decided to put one and one together.

The pipe is based loosely on one that appeared in the Summer-Autumn
1995 issue of the Ephemeris, made by Mr. Marshall of Millville
Ltd. and owned by O.F.W. Fisher.  It's a beauty -- a straight stem
with two apple bowls, in line, about six inches long, with a natural
finish and a great-looking tight grain pattern with some birdseyes.
The bowls are separated by about a half inch of thicker stem.

The pipe has a flat bottom so it will stand up on a desk.  Mark
supplied two stems, a P-stem and a flat, crunch-resistant one.  Both
stems are inlaid with a ring of wood and a small silver star cased in
lucite.  I've so far only used the P-bit.  

Mark and I both had fun with the design, which we did by email, and
his execution was as flawless as almost any human activity can be.
One bowl is sliiiiightly thicker than the other, but that's all.  As
was to be expected, there are a couple of minor sand pits, which I
asked Mark not to fill.  I've taken photos, which I hope Mark will put
on his Web page, if they come out.

So what's it like to smoke a multi-engine briar?  Well, it's an
experience for the advanced amateur, not for the beginner.  I'm
learning all over again how to keep a pipe lit!

It's nice and cool, if both bowls are burning.  Keeping them both
burning has required some attention.  One or the other of the bowls
won't stay lit unless they are packed just right.  This means packing
it proportionally, so the outer one draws a bit harder than the inner
one.

I'm still playing with the packing.  The first time I smoked it, I put
some McConnell Red Virginia in one bowl and one of Craig Tarler's
blends in the other.  This was a mistake, as it makes it hard to
balance the bowls with two different kinds of tobacco.  The second
time, I used one blend in both bowls; this seems to give better
results.  Hopefully, after a few hours, the technique will become
automatic.  Then, I'll play with blending at the time of combustion,
which I'm eager to accomplish.

Last but not least, this is one pipe I'm _never_ going to smoke in the
car.  The police here are on the lookout for drug paraphenalia; the
papers are replete with cars being searched for pot after being
stopped for broken taillights and failure to dim high beams.  So I'd
prefer to look inconspicuous while driving.  But I hope to bring the
Tinsky two-bowl out at a show soon and have some fun with it!  (I'd
love to see the double-takes! :-)

Mark and I have also discussed fitting the pipe, or one like it, with
an in-line screw adjustment for flow balancing.  He assures me that
this is possible, but suggested that experience would help more.  At
this point, I think he's right.

If anyone else here has played with multi-bowls, I'd appreciate
hearing your experiences, and tips on technique.  Until next issue,
then, 

			Smoke in peace,
			~\UU Steve.

&gt;From: Chuck Basso &lt;??????@??.??????.???&gt;
&gt;Subject: Meerschaum

&gt;1.  Everyone knows that meerschaum translates to "sea-foam."  Why?  Due to
&gt;its low specific gravity (1-2 times the weight of water) and considerable
&gt;porosity, it will commonly float.  Romantic allusions aside, this seems the
&gt;most plausible of all the explanations I have seen for the name.

Actually, in "Tobacco Leaves" (published in 1915 by Index Press), the
author W.A. Brennan explains the origin of the name in the idea that
the substance we call meerschaum was thought to be fossilized sea-foam
(!) I don't have the book in front of me, but there are references to
other publications that he cites as his sources. If you would like
those references, send me e-mail.

There's even a lovely little anecdote about the first meerschaum pipe
being made, which I will transcribe if there is interest. (It's a GREAT
little book, if a bit outdated in some of its technical and economic
data)

<a name="32">Subject: The smell from resting pipes</a>

Hi again everybody,

I have a nasty question to ask. The aroma coming from pipe I am puffing
doesn't bother at all my wife, who is a cigarette smoker.  On the contrary,
she likes a lot most of the English blends (from C&amp;D) I smoke. The problem
is that she doesn't like a bit the smell of pipes resting in a rack. She
thinks they stink :-(

Do other members in P.D. have similar experiences?
Has somebody invented a solution for this "stinking" problem?
I would like to read about these inventions. Lay your inventions bare,
please!  I'm getting desperate ;-(

Dry ashes!

Antti Kalliokoski (??????@???.??)

[ After a good cleaning with pure grain alcohol, my pipes don't tend
to smell bad, especially if I put a cleaner in with them.  On the
other hand, my wife doesn't care for the aroma of pre-smoked tobacco
in the ashtray... -S. ]

HAPPIER NEWS: Tom Dunn, in the latest issue of the _Ephemeris_, asks
for a comprehensive list of all Internet tobacco resources.  Shall we
help him out?  (Although Steve Beaty does a great job with the Web
site, I'm sure there are a few places he hasn't linked yet, and I also
know the Resource Guide is not comprehensive.)  If you have a list of
Web sites and/or email addresses anywhere, please send it in and I'll
collate them and send them to TUCOPS Headquarters (and publish them
here.)  Thanks!

Also, the CD-ROM Digest may be coming closer to reality.  I hope to
acquire a HP flatbed color scanner and Tom's permission to scan some
of the _Ephemeris_ photos and drawings.  If anyone knows where I can
get my hands on a (used!) scanner, please let me know!

Hi Steve:

I've finally succeeded in my quest to find quality cigars and pipe tobacco 
in Taiwan. The shop is called Smoker's Inn (Lin Bai Hsin  in Mandarin - 
which means happy cypress forest, the connection escapes me). They have a 
good selection of pipes, tobacco and cigars (including Cohiba and Davidoff) 
and the people are very helpful. They're expensive, but everything is 
expensive in this town.  They are located at HsinYi Road, Section 4, Lane 
199, No. 28 (886 2 707 0675, Fax 886 2 707 0674) in Taipei and SiWeiEr 
Road, No. 219 (886 7 722 5736, Fax: 886 7 722 5793) in Kaohsiong. Please 
add them to your list.

<a name="3">Subject: Re: Routing pipe racks</a>

In reply to your message of Fri, 28 Jun 1996 09:41:07 EDT:

Hi Steve,

In regard to your question in the last digest on routing pipe rack sections,
while by no means a sage in the ways of woodworking, I do have a couple
of suggestions:

1) Clamp the board to be routed between two scap boards-- this is a common
way to prevent chipout when doing through cuts of various kinds. Then, use a
drill press with the appropriate Forstner bit to cut the C-shape.

2) Clamp as above, but instead use a router with a bit of the appropriate
size. Arrange parallel guides for the router base to make a straight cut
into the work. 

I've seen some pipe racks with a circular hole for the pipe and then a 
smaller "notched opening" for insertion of the pipe; I'm not sure how I'd 
try making one of those, but a first attempt would be to drill press cut
the hole and then-- after rearranging boards-- with a board clamped against
the edge I'd route the notch from inside the hole to the edge of the board.

Hope this was at least of some use for a text-only description... ;-) :-/

Thanks again for a great Digest!,
	Cheers,
		Paul

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #219 -- June 30, 1996</a>

Steve:

        On an administrative note, is it acceptable to refer to the many
pages of the Pipe Digest in a paper article?  My wife and I are writing for
Neil Murray's A&amp;M Gazette, and a question came up regarding the Peterson
Pipe and it's suitability for beginners.  I used a letter from the 82nd
issue as part of the reference for my answer, and gave the author, you, the
Digest and the web page credit for the quote.  Are you okay with this?  I
note your commercial restriction, and while there is money involved in just
about any printed matter, no one can claim a profit from any of this!

        Strangely enough, the following letter was in the most recent PD,
and the article in the A&amp;M Gazette answers it wonderfully, so I would refer
the reader there for a partial answer!

From: "Dave Tainer":

&gt; Now on to some personal matters.  I subscribed to PD more for the
&gt; cigar aspect rather than the pipe subject matter, but I have to say
&gt; that I have become interested in pipe smoking now.  My wife is
&gt; traveling to Ireland next month and she asked what I would like her to
&gt; bring me back.  Knowing that Peterson is there, I suggested she bring
&gt; me back a Peterson pipe.  I have not smoked a pipe before (not really)
&gt; and I was wondering if this would be a good way to go about getting
&gt; started.  Is there a Peterson shop in any of the big cities in Ireland
&gt; or would you just go to any tobacco shop?  Any help in this area,
&gt; particularly by the Irish members of PD would be gratefully
&gt; appreciated.

        I, also, would be interested in assisting production of a PDCD, and
would be interested in purchase as well.  Let me know if there is anything I
can do!!  I am a webmaster for Jade Inc (Check us out at www.jadeinc.com and
www.americashmall.com) and if there is anything interactive I can do, I'll
be willing.

From: "Steve Masticola":
&gt;[ Thanks, Kevin!  We also had favorable comments on the CD-ROM from
&gt;many other members, below.  BTW, if there's anyone on the group who
&gt;would like to produce a CD-ROM commercially, please give us a yell.  I
&gt;think there's some potential for a product here, especially for the
&gt;burgeoning cigar market. I would be glad to help out, provided that a
&gt;portion of the profits is given to an agreeable charity (perhaps Cap
&gt;Cure), the addresses are stripped, and it doesn't turn into a black
&gt;hole for time.  The Digest is a hobby for me, and I don't wish to make
&gt;a personal profit from it -- or to take a big personal loss, either! -S. ]

        ObPipeNote: Aside from the recent article in A&amp;MG, I have been
fairly quiet on the pipe front.  Recently picked up a matched pair of
Nording freehands for Gabrielle and myself; still smoking Grail from Barclay

<a name="7">Subject: A Pleasant Cigar Weekend</a>

Hello, Steve,

  I had a couple of pleasant cigar-smoking experiences over this last
weekend that I thought I'd share.

  First of all, every once in awhile I'll leave work an hour early and take
the earlier commuter train. This one, unfortunately, doesn't go all the way
to my stop, so I'll get off in a town called Claremont and head up a couple
of blocks to the Claremont Tobacco House. After chatting with whoever's
there for a little while, I'll buy at least one cigar which I'll take
across the street to a park bench. There I'll sit and smoke for 30-40
minutes until it's time to catch my usual train for home. This last Friday
I was sitting and smoking an Oscar 400 when a lady walked by carrying
packages from one of the other local shops.  I thought nothing of it until
she gets about 20 yards down the street, turns, and calls out to me, "You
know, your cigar smells really good!"  I, of course, thanked her warmly.
It's so unusual to get a positive comment from a total stranger like that,
that I have to admit, it gave me a kind of warm, fuzzy feeling for a
change.

  Secondly, Saturday night some friends and I arranged to have a surprise
birthday party for my wife. After we had eaten and she had opened her
gifts, many of us were out in the back yard where it was cooler. I had, of
course, let everyone know that they were more than welcome to sample my
humidor.  Some were already cigar smokers, others had never really tried a
good hand-rolled premium.  Well, to make a long story short, at one point I
looked around and there were 6 or 7 of us with cigars and drinks in hand
chatting amicably and enjoying our tobacco.  My very own mini-smoker!

  In the last Digest (#219), Antti Kalliokoski asked about bad-smelling
pipes sitting in the rack, and I would have to agree with you, Steve, that
regular and thorough cleaning is the answer.  I always run both ends of a
pipecleaner through the stem of a pipe after I've smoked it, then bend it
over and swab out the bowl.  I also rotate my pipes religiously making sure
than all get an equal workout and, more importantly, than none get
oversmoked.  Then, about every six months, I take each pipe apart and clean
out any buildup that's accumulated.  I simply use a pipe sweetener, but
grain alcohol is probably better.  I let the clean pipes dry out overnight
before putting them back together.  I've been following these rituals for a
long time now and neither I nor any of my family or friends has ever
noticed a bad smell emanating from my racks.

  And now I have one quick question before I go--does anyone know of a
retailer that sells the Butera and Esoterica Tobacciana pipe tobaccos
mailorder?  I can't find a retailer here in So. Calif. that sells them and
I've been wanting to give them a try.  Any info would be appreciated.

--Ed


[ Sorry, Ed, I don't happen to know offhand.  "A Little Taste of Cuba"
sells Butera; you might want to give Jorge a call and see if he'll
ship some to you. Or call Mike Butera directly at (210) 590-1802.
(Good luck getting a response!) -S. ]

Niagara Falls, on both the Canadian and U.S. sides, is not a Mecca of
pipe-smoking, from my experience (I was raised nearby -- eeek!).  But,
there is a truly wonderful tobacconist at the corner of Pearl and Main
Sts. in Buffalo, NY (only about 1/2 hr. away from N.F.): Bernstone's.  The
usual Bernstone's warning, though: they are _really, really_ punctual.  At
5 p.m. sharp, the metal doors close.  So get there early, M-F 9-5 (I
believe) and Sat. until (if I recall correctly) 2 pm. 

[I don't know if this is worth sending to the list, since the info. is 
probably in the directory.]

Hey Everybody...

As I sat through reading PD, I felt a compulsion to relay a few pipe 
stories myself to all the members out there.

First let me say that I just graduated from the University of 
California, Irvine, on June 15.  I was selected to deliver the 
commencement speech for our graduating class, a daunting task indeed.  In 
the weeks leading up to the big day, I spent many an evening preparing my 
speech and revising it.  Each time I did so, I was accompanied by my 
friend, the ever-present pipe.  I credit the contemplative state of mind 
it created with helping me to write a speech that proved successful and 
well-liked.  On the big day, I walked up to the podium and looked out at 
nearly 4000 people and wished very seriously that I'd tucked a pipe into 
my graduation robes.  Unfortunately, such preparedness would be 
uncharacteristic.  

I recently picked up a new straight-stemmed GBD and noticed, with some 
consternation, an small problem with the vulcanite stem.  When I 
purchased it, it was shiny, smooth, and black.  When I smoked it however, 
the top left edge of the stem has discolored into a dull brown. It has 
had no effect on the quality of the pipe, but it's unsightly.  Should I 
just have it buffed again?  

Another thing.  My fiance just bought a car, a Honda Civic DX.  Am I the 
only one who was surprised to learn that they are now making "non-smoking 
cars".  When the salesman told us that, I had to conceal my amusement.  
"Forget the side-impact airbags Charlie, let's make it a non-smoking car 
instead!"  Anyway, I just thought it was lame that they would make a car 
with no ashtray or cigarette lighter.  Even my non-smoking friends like 
the ashtray as a coin storage center.  Oh well...

I'd also like to thank, once again, my local tobacconist here, Orange 
County, Southern California, Jim Allison, at the Tobacco Barn in El Toro 
California.  I'll give the address next time if it's not in the Guide.  
When I was in Cambridge, England for two months last summer, I picked up 
a gorgeous Savinelli.  Surprisingly, the shank swelled ever so slightly in 
the next few months and consequently, the vulcanite stem kept falling 
out.  Despairingly, I went to Jim to ask if there was anything I could do 
for my precious pipe.  He announed that it was easily repaired, and for 
$10 did exactly that and replaced the tenon so that my savinelli is no 
longer a filter pipe (a good thing in my mind's eye).

Okay, one final thing, then I'll shut up.  I'm going to Hastings Law 
School in San Francisco in August.  Is there a general consensus on the 
quality of pipe stores in the area?   Thanks again to you all, and sorry 
if I blabbered too much!

Scott

[ Congrats on the graduation, Scott!  And the "non-smoking cars" can
always be converted with a quick trip to almost any auto supply shop.
BTW, this recalls to me the time NPR ballyhooed the execrable Chrysler
Neon as "the first car without an ashtray" (implied "whoopee!"), but
failed to note that it was also a car without a rear window defogger.
Go figure... -S. ]

Hello S - thanks for doing a great job.
This might be og general interess to PD readers.
I have also answered GS directly...   /Jesper

About pipe carving kits.

In PD 209 Mr George Sjostrom asked where to buy a carving kit.
Well, if you're in Europe then go to Denmark, to the peninsula
Jutland and the city of Randers. The FF Pipe shop there sells
kits for less than 15 USD including stem and the bowl already
made. However, I think they have had the same kits on stock
for several years and that the real price should be higher.

They also have some cheaper kits where youy have to make the
bowl yourself. If you are REALLY interested I could try to
arrange some mail order for you - e.mail me.

If any of you are in the neighbourhood (!) you ought to visit
the shop in Adelgade. Quite a lot af US senior citizens visit
Randers, so spread the word...

Sincerly,
Jesper Klith

<a name="14">Subject: Pipes Digest &lt;Reading Material - A Book Review&gt;</a>

     To all,
     
     I am happy to have been able to re-subscribe to this wonderful forum. 
     I took leave of it for several months but in that time was able to 
     read a wonderful book by a fellow named Klien (last name  -  I am too 
     feeble to remember his first name &lt;perhaps Richard, perhaps Kevin&gt; at 
     the moment,) entitled "Cigarettes Are Sublime."
     
     Dr. Klein (he is the Ph.D. variety of Dr., not the the M.D.) is a 
     professor of French at Cornell University (I was given this book by my 
     best friend, and a student of Dr. Klein's) and decided to write his 
     book on smoking from a societal and cultural point of view. He tends 
     to frame his analysis of popular culture, with references to smoking, 
     in terms of some obscure French literature but many of his examples 
     are not (e.g. "Casablanca.")
     
     One point he argues is that it is precisely the cigarette's futility 
     that ensures its survival of the current anti-smoking culture. That, 
     had cigarettes any utility they would be much easier to fight, from a 
     variety of standpoints.
     
     Though he only touches breifly on pipes &amp; cigars, it is clear that 
     many of the same mechanisms within our culture that apply to 
     cirgarettes apply to them.
     
     It is a wonderfully written, fascinating book which, in addition to 
     the cultural discussion, includes some history and allegory of smoking 
     figures. There is the anecdote of Sir Walter Ralleigh making &amp; winning 
     wager that he could measure the weight of cigarette smoke - which he 
     did by weighing an unlit cigarette, then smoking it (all the while 
     carefully ashing on the balance) and then weighing the ash - 
     substracting the difference and voila! Also, the interesting technique 
     of the famous street photographer Henry Cartier Bresson using the time 
     it took him to smoke either a Gitane or a Galouises to determine his 
     night-time exposures (He used the Gitanes when it was slightly darker 
     out becuase they took longer to smoke.)
     
     He does fine work of laying out the historical signifigance of tobacco 
     to Troops during battles, to women during times of societal oppression 
     and to thinking, feeling human beings when they contemplate the 
     unbearable lightness of being. He asserts that while smoking, time is 
     suspended for the smoker - that each moment spent with smoke is a 
     moment spent with the congealed presence of life, or time and of 
     experience. That when you are in a room, smokig and talking with 
     friends, the smoke is the physical - meta-physical manifestation of 
     our aura and souls mixing in the air. Smoke is much, and much more 
     still than authors of "Anti-smoking" legislation will ever be able to 
     understand - its more than money, its more than prestige, it is 
     Sublime.
     
     Anyhow, I promised myself that I would recommend this book to readers 
     of this list when I returned and I have, and so I have.

In the July edition of the "Scientific American", page 99: Briefly
Noted the "Cigarette Papers". Several thousand pages of legal
documents from a tobacco company law firm found their way into the
public domain. The Cigarette Papers chronical the response of BAT
Industries and Brown &amp; Williamson to the growing evidence that their
product kills. These papers are on-line at
"<a href="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco">http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco</a>", in the Tobacco Control Archives
along with a lot of other material that will put the wind-up those
people dedicated to the enjoyment of tobacco. I think it would be
whimsical for the Pipes Web Site install a hyperlink to the Tobacco
Control Archives.

On a literary note, I can recommend the biography of Sax Rohmer,
"Master of Villainy" by Cay Van Ash and Elizabeth Sax Rohmer. Sax
Rohmer smoked a pipe; the frontispiece shows him with a Bulldog
clenched between his teeth. I borrowed my copy via Interlibrary Loan.

I'm an italian pipe smoker who would be glad to share informations
and point of views on our common love for pipe,tobacco and related

I have been smoking for 15 years and never stopped it.I have a lot
of pipes  English made (Dunhills ,Ashton,Sasieni) and also a lot
of pipes made by Italian firms (mainly Castello and Ser Jacopo).
Usually I smoke Classical English Mixtures because I deeply love
the Latakia flavours.In late months I discovered a tobacco that in
Italy is not imported (We have a monopoly dictatorship here in
matter of tobacco)but i realized that this marvelous Slice is made
in Denmark for the USA market:it calls Bengal Slices and it is
superbous.Isnt' it?

<a name="18">Subject: Tobaccos</a>

Hello Steve!
I verified that I wrote to Tom Dunn on May the 17th,and I believe
that I have to wait before rewriting again.Anyway,for the future,I
will follow your good advise.I'm puffing in my Four Dot Sasieni
and since it's lunchtime in my office I will tell you something
more about myself as usual for the new enlisted in the Digest.
I am 37 year old,married with a math teacher and with two kids .
My job is Marketing Coordinator in a Multi-National Telecom
Corporate and I began smoking Pipe when I was attending at the
University(a lot of years ago).Since then I never stopped and had
 a lot of journeys into the beautifull world of pipe and
tobaccos.What I found is that it is an infinite world with
infinite possibilities and it contributed to relax and soothe me
in every moment of my life(expecially in the difficult ones
when,being in the Operations,the stress and the hardness of the
job where quite overhelming indeed).
In all those years I created I little collection of very good
pipes Englishmade of course but also Italians ,due to the fact
that I have the luck of living in a Country in which pipe carvers
and factories are of excellent level.
Like most pipe smokers,I began with a Danish sweet Mixture (Sweet
Dublin Whiskey Flavoured) which had the quality to introduce me in
the pipe smoking life without huge difficulties.As time went by,my
preference changed ,having discovered in the mean time the
satisfaction English Mixtures can give,and now I have reached a
good "statu quo" smoking in daytime Danish mixtures (Larsen etc)
and reserving evening hours to the pleasures of Latakia.As I wrote
 to you lately ,I discovered in late months the Bengal Slices that
is,I suppose,a good trade-off between Danish and English Mixtures
and very satisfying indeed.Unfortunally it can't be found in Italy
and I have to ask the precious tinderboxes to someone who travels
to your country.That is, my reserves have to be centellinated like
a rare Beaujoles!
That's all for this time,have good puffes

<a name="19">Subject: Castello Pipes</a>

Hello Steve!
I would ask you an advise about a newbought Castello pipe.
Recently I bought a new Old Antiquary KKK Rhodesian and,having
lately bought only Dunhill and Ashton pipes (that require not much
care in the burn-in phase) made no care in the first three or four
times.I noticed that in this new pipe a lot of holes appeared and
sometimes i feel a burned wood smell.
In a few words I feared having burned my pipe (never
happened before!)
I decided however to keep on smoking this pipe using the following
technique:first of all using only that mixtures that give a not
fast burning like Three Nuns ,Slices and Curly cut in
general;further I tried to smoke the cooler I could reach always
making the best attention in order not overheat the bowl.
The result is that after a dozen of times it seems like a wound
being in the closing phase.It seems to me that the pipe is like a
living being.What can you say on this topic?Are there others
things I must do in order to continue in making a good cake?
Regarding the proposal of filing all the PD collection in a CD-ROM
 I agree to this proposal and let me know what kind of decision
will be taken;It must be considered,however,that an action of this
kind means also that must be foreseen a regular update system in
order to insert the new issues in the CD-ROM.
So,every year or six months a new CD-ROM must be released and this
is a cost that must be considered .
Let me know.

[ I've been offered access to a single-copy CD-ROM burner, at cost.
So updating every six months wouldn't be that much of a problem, I
hope! -S. ]

<a name="20">Subject: Some experiences in choosing the right tobacco</a>

Hi everybody!

I am new to this list and this posting is my first one. I am also new
to pipe smoking, have begun only a few weeks ago because I was sick
and tired of the stinky smell of cigarettes and wanted to smoke
something with more flavour and with alot more pleasure. Smoking
cigarettes was and ist to me like smoking yourself to death, and not
because you enjoy the whole act of lighting, smoking and smelling a
fine pipe. But I still wouldn't dare to call me a "real pipe smoker"
because I only smoke a few times a week.

I have also followed the Digest for some weeks now and would like to
pose some questions. Since I am from Germany, it would be a special
pleasure for me to talk to one or two pipe smokers from here
directly. I also don't know if we can buy the same sorts of tobacco
over here than you can in America or anywhere else. This came to my
mind because I wasn't able to find any of the tobaccos I tried yet in
any of the lists published on the WWW site.

I seem to be one of those who still love aromatic tobaccos. But this
is possibly due to the fact that I haven't tried a good natural one
yet. I have begun with a pretty strong "Avalon Mixture", blended with
red wine. It smells absolutely wonderful but is still pretty tough on
the tongue (Virginia Red). Now, I am trying "Indian Summer". The sign
on the pouch says it's "Indian Cut", but what exactly does this mean ?
It is of considerably darker colour than Avalon and seems to taste
ALOT smoother and less "tough" on the tongue. Maybe anyone could give
me some more information and tips on choosing a fine tobacco with an
aromatic flavour that is available here in Germany too ? (BTW, I live
in Heidelberg...) I can only remember all those strange names like
"German mixture", "Springwater" and so on...

Thanx alot in advance,
Sincerely,
Bijan Kafi

[ I have no idea what "Indian Cut" is, Bijan! -S. ]

I just started fly fishing this season. Apart from problems I m having with

are trout out there to catch. Last night I stumbled up a beautiful stream
in Hickory Run State Park. Not a whole lot of room to cast but lots of
pretty clear pools and rapids. Managed to catch two on a Slight Drake and a
brown elk hair Caddis.I got all my flies out of the other things I "caught"
so it was a successful evening.

I smoke either a full bent large ball that I made years ago or a Ser Jacapo
large bent billiard filled w/ Mac Baren's Golden Extra. Both smoke well and
have a carved finish . They are balanced well enough to leave in my mouth
for hours. I m so used to a pipe hanging out of my mouth that I leave it in
long after it goes out.The Golden Extra burns well and dry enough that
after a couple of matches to light it burns down without further help.

All in all smoking a pipe while fishing greatly adds to the experience. For
as most of the time you don t catch fish; what could be better than smoking
in a gorgeous setting for pure personal pleasure ! Mark Tinsky

<a name="22">Subject: Queries from a new pipe smoker</a>

Hi everyone:
A relative newcomer to the pipe-smoking realms, I, too enjoy PD and would be
interested in a CD-ROM.  In the meantime, I'm hoping for some words of wisdom.

I started on pipes about 2 months ago as part of a campaign to quit smoking
cigarettes.  Now that I've figured out what to do with the smoke (if I can't
inhale, what *do* I do with it??? was my first question), I really enjoy it.
I have two pipes -- a "regular-size" rough-finished Duncan (that's a
Peterson wannabe, right?) and a small, lightweight smooth-finished Bent Bob
-- both of which I really like, and am exploring different tobacco blends.
I can even keep both pipes lit for more than two minutes at a time -- so I
guess I'm making good progress on those fronts.

One problem I can't seem to get rid of is the pipes smoking awfully hot when
I draw at a rate that feels real comfortable and also keeps the pipes lit
for more than a few minutes.  They also both get pretty soggy as I approach
the last 1/3 or so of the bowl.  Any suggestions?   Also, will I ever get to
the point where I don't have to relight 3 times for each bowl???

I was also hoping someone could  point me in the direction of a more
thorough guide to tobaccos and blends than the one in the FAQ (I liked it,
but want more info).  I'm currently patronizing a very nice local
tobacconist and trying his "house" blends, which is quite fun, but would
like to be able to describe my likes and dislikes in terms of the different
elements of each (e.g. -- I've got a blend that I like pretty well now, but
it smokes a bit soggy and I'd like something with more of one of the
component flavors -- but I don't know what that flavor is!).  Hints?

Keep up the good work.

<a name="23">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #219 -- June 30, 1996</a>

There's a widespread misconception that the cause of the gurgle in the
bowl of some pipes is saliva. Individual pipesmokers might reach the
point of causing a pavlovian gurgle, but most of us have pipes that
smoke wet and others that smoke dry, same smoker, same saliva. I don't
think many of us are boiling spit. There's something else afoot.

It would be useful to hear from the scientists of this list about
their gurgle theories.  I'm not a scientist, but can start with four
points.

1. Water vapor is a byproduct of most free air combustion. Hold a cold
mirror near the flame of a bone-dry match's flame and you'll see
moisture condense.

2. There's some kind of construction or geometry issue here. I have a
long straightgrain James Upshall churchwarden; there's just no way my
dry mouth is contributing any significant moisture to the bowl, but it
wants to gurgle right off, even if weeks dry. Must have something to
do with the construction/geometry of the pipe.

3. Smoking very slowly seems to avoid gurgle in my wetest pipes, and
smoking fast can make my driest pipes moist. (This might be the same
point as #1. Smoking slowly may allow an equilibrium between moisture
creation and removal).

4. The obvious: moist, flavored or glycoled tobaccos smoke wetter. Straight, 
properly humidified (not dry or wet) unglycoled tobaccos are the driest.

Hello,  just thought I would drop a line.  Love the Digest.

On a personal note I have had some recent changes in my pipe 
lifestyle and I thought I would share them with the PD and see if 
anyone has any answers they might field.

My wife has recently gone on medication that has precluded her 
smoking again and in a show of support I am giving up my cigars and 
tobacco too.  Truth be told its not as hard  due to the fact I havent 
smoked a cigar since my daughter Fiona was born in April.  She lived 
only a short half hour and Daddy never got to pass out the cigars he 
had lovingly chosen for the occasion, until the reception after the 
Funeral.  

I just have not had the craveing for the taste of tobacco but I still 
can appreciate the aroma of smoke and leaf,  and as always my wife 
and I appreciate a good pipe, she collects churchwardens and I 
collect everything else!

I still feel the need to enjoy that knot of peace a pipe can give, but
no longer count tobacco as a option.  I have tried some of the Native
American traditional non-tobaco blends which are actually quite
unique.  I am wondering if any readers have heard of non tobacco
smoking options, excepting any of that illegal garbage that is not fit
to grace Pipe or body.  Any leads would be appreciated.  Please keep
in mind that I am a very traditon respecting smoker and do not puff
for the buzz or the taste alone, and I have great respect for the ways
of the Native traditions.

Hey, all you Dads, put the pipe  down and invite your kids in to  
help you clean your pipes.  Quality time, every second is worth it

re: Brad Williams' query on reconstituting dried-out tabak: my local
tobacconist showed me a method that has worked very well for me: dampen a
largish bowl (preferably a wooden one) and pat it dry so that the inside of
the bowl is not dripping wet; then pour the dessicated tobacco into the
bowl and stir with your hands. The tobacco absorbs the water from the bowl
quickly and evenly, and it doesn't get overly wet.

Steve and all;
	I bring terrible news from the war front.
	I am writing from Niagara Falls, Ontario. The greater Metro
Toronto Area ( the heart of downtown Toronto ) has banned ALL smoking as
of January 1 1997 in bars and restaurants. I'm not sure yet of all the
details but I'll post them as I get the full story. There are still some
conflicting reports. I do know that the bars will not have a separate
ventilation system - just no smoking at all. I think ( I'm not sure )
that the restaurants will follow suit.
	I haven't heard anything about tobacco restrictions.
	Maybe someone from Toronto could give us the real deal.
	Being the calm pipe smoker I am though, I'm used to being booted
outside while cigarette smokers smoke inside...but while I'm outside
I ask the cigar smokers for a light !:-)

                   Light a pipe for me, I'll be home in the morning.

&gt; 
&gt; I don't quite understand the point you are making here, would you 
&gt;offer  some clarification?

In terms of quality probably the best board by far is Compuserve (I'm 
not on it due to cost, so I'm not tooting my own horn) take a look at 
there pipe tobacco reviews and comparisons.  They are flat out 
outstanding, best thing I've seen in any media and for those of us with 
less discriminating pallets (including the undersigned) a textbook in 
what to try to look (actually taste &amp; smell) for.  Further, it has the 
support of Bob Hamlim, while some might say, 'he's a dealer' the fact is 
that perhaps excepting the all too soon deceased Barry Levin (who was 
also a dealer) I can think of no one in recent years that has 
contributed more to the art and knowledge of pipes.  

It is simply a tragedy that the Compuserve postings are not forwarded to 
alt.smokers.pipes where they could be digested and discussed by a larger 
audience.

Somewhat similarly - in the email format there's OoOPs and Pipe Smokers 
Digest certainly valuable and worthwhile in and of themselves but 
wouldn't we all be the better for it if the emails as received by OoOPs 
and PSD were forwarded to alt.smokers.pipes.  In another format there's 
the pipe IRC, I have to take the time to figure out how to use it but in 
the interim and for all of us, wouldn't it be nice if someone could 
upload interesting segments.  And lastly, although too much to hope for 
there is Tom Dunn's The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris, wouldn't it fantastic 
if mail to the Ephemeris was scanned, converted to ASCII and uploaded 
here!!  

If all of the above were not changed an iota but also channeled into 
alt.smokers.pipes this would truly be an outstanding board and perhaps 
the beginnings of a truly international pipe community.
    
PS.  For an example of an excellent board, that combines community, 
sharing of expertise at all levels, sharing of B/S opportunities and 
fairly heavy volume see the Pen board on AOL (in Collector's 
Corner/Other Collectibles or something like that).

<a name="31">Subject: PD nos.218-9</a>

Steve-
I/m really enjoying PD.  Would like to offer a few comments and ask a few 
questions.
1.Re: Chuck Basso
  I'd like to know what they put in Royal Yacht too.  It's an enjpyable 
enough smoke until my stomach gets wind of the fact that I'm smoking it. 
My symptoms are different in that this blend sends me to the medicine 
cabinet for Mylanta or Tagamet.  So, Chuck, you're not alone.
  I remember Malaga pipies well and am surprised they're still around in 
Royal Oak, MI.  The founder used to boil his bowls in oil"way back when." 
I still have a few of these pipes--good smokers all.  The founder would 
stamp the words "Ras Kassa" on a particularly good piece.  I think tthis 
is Armenian but have no idea what it means.  Being a Miciganian, former 
president Gerald Ford smoked Malagas.  Oh for the days when a President 
could smoke in public.

2. I read a comment in PD218 about Lorenzo pipes.  My experience with 
them is that they were poorly made and a pain in the shank to break in. 
True they were inexpensive, but so were a couple of old Savinellis which 
are in one piece and smoke vey well.

3. Since reading of the potential, if not real, loss of Balkan Sobranie, 
I bout a couple of tins.  I hadn't smoked this in years.  The standby for 
me is My Mix.965 but I did enjoy the Balken S.

4. Perhaps the Danish readers could help me here:
   I picked up a beautiful piece of briar at a flea mkt.  It's tamped 
"Danmark" (get the spelling) the letters "D." and "E." are stamped in the 
shank as well. Can anyone identify?
I also found a nice straight grain (tight graining) made by "Nielson". My 
guess is that it's an early 70's or before vintage.  I wonder if this is 
any relation to Bjarn (or Bjorn)?
5. Note on Ben Wade: The "Original Smokers' Haven" in Columbus, Ohio made 
have a few of the Peben Holm era freehand left from a collection of 
unsmoked pieces they were able to get hold of.  They had a few of the 
Charatan era pipes as well.  

6. Does anyone out there have aline on bulk pipe cleaners?  I go through 
alot of extra absorbent and tapered.

Keep your tobacco lit.

Mark

Steve,
  
     Just got PD#219, and enjoyed reading it, as usual.  Its great that such
a free form forum works, and noone charges for it to boot!

     I wanted to comment on the CD-rom idea.  We just put together a
commercial quality title at work and got 1000 copies of it made, so I thought
I might share my thoughts on what it would take to produce a CD for Pipes
Digest.  First question to ask is:  Will this CD be just an archive, or
should it have a colorful user interface?  Will it be just windows or mac, or
both?  If a user interface is desired, then this could easily be done in
Director, by Macromedia.  Pictures, video and sound bites could then be
included, if so desired.  An  archive search would also be possible, I think.
 I would willing to work on this for free in my spare time.  I have the
necessary tools and resources to program this up, and create CD masters.

     The actual commercial run of the CDs is another matter.  We got 1000
cd's, with 4-color, 4 page cover, cd tray card(the back of the jewel case),
jewel cases, and two color cd silk screen art for $2300(US).  This is pretty
much the minimum order and price.  In order to do this, we should make sure
that there are enough people willing to buy it just to cover this cost.  I
feel that the cd could be priced between $7-$12.  I state this without
knowing what it costs to ship a CD thru the mail.  If it is more than I am
guessing (~$1) then the price should go up slightly.  This would cover
shipping, shipping materials, a charity donation, take up the slack for
unsold CDs, and possibly leave a little change for the backer(s) to buy a
really nice pipe.  This cost could go down if it was felt that a jewel case
with artwork was unnecessary(maybe by $500-800).

     Steve, and others, what I would like to know, is how many people
actually would buy this, and what would everyone be willing to pay?  Like I
said, I will volunteer my labor, but we (the Pipes Digest community) need to
determine if it is economically feasible.  If we get beyond this stage, then
we can get down to details of format, content, and financial backing.  This
could be a really neat idea, let's see what the interest in it is.

Thanks
John Ayers

[ John, I guess I've gotten maybe 10-20 yesses on the CD-ROM, which
certainly wouldn't be enough to justify a volume run.  I've also
learned that there are _two_ cigar CD-ROMs on the market now, so our
product wouldn't be unique.  So my plan now is to first assemble a
CD-ROM with the Web page materials and some scans (keeping it simple),
and then accumulate orders and do a small run maybe every six months.

But perhaps Rick Hacker would be interested in putting out an Ultimate
Pipe/Cigar CD-ROM? If so, we could get fancier. -S. ]

Steve, I'm sending you this item from the OPC July newsletter for the

BARCLAY TO OPEN SECOND STORE
 
Mick Ratliff and Pam Tufts, co-owners of Barclay Pipe &amp; Tobacco in the Lane
Ave. Mall, Columbus, OH, have announced the opening of a second store, to
be called Barclay Tobacco &amp; Cigars, at 2673 Federated Blvd. in the Service
Merchandise Plaza just off Sawmill Rd. between 161 and 270.  The new
Barclay will open in mid-July, with a grand opening blowout scheduled for
early August, featuring Tim West carving pipes on site.  The shop will
boast 1,500 square feet of retail space (two and a half times the space
available at Lane Ave.), with 300 square feet of enclosed humidor space
(four times the footage available at Lane Ave.) in two separate humidors.
It will also feature cigar storage lockers available for monthly rent.  I
visited the site while it was still bare to the walls, and it is a fine,
large store front with lots of easy parking.
 
Both Barclays will continue to carry the same full line of
merchandise--including estate pipes--that the original Barclay has been
noted for.  However, shoppers may find the Lane Ave. Barclay even more
convenient and accessible now because, in the future, all deliveries and
pricing of merchandise will take place at the new store, thus eliminating
the crowding that sometimes occurred at Lane Ave.  Both stores will be open
Mon.-Sat., 10:00- 9:00 and Sunday 10:00-6:00.  The knowledgeable Bob
Russell will manage the new Barclay, whose telephone number is 614-764-0300
and whose fax number is 614-764-0340.

since grown and continue to grow.  It's going to be a great show, and we
invite everyone to try and make it.  As always, contact me for a
complimentary newsletter and membership form and/or a show flyer.
 
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PLEASURES OF WINE DRINKING AND PIPE SMOKING
 
Our secretary has requested that I contribute an article on the obvious
pleasures of wine drinking and pipe smoking.  Drawing on my past and
present activities as a wine consultant and consumer, I will briefly
outline my own preferences along with a guide to the wine types (varietals)
available.  Let me emphasize that, just as with tobaccos, the only thing
important is an individual's personal taste.  Drink what you like with what
you like to smoke, eat, etc.  Forget what others like if it does not suit
you.  An obvious example of this rule is the aforementioned secretary's
choice of tobacco versus my choice of tobacco.  (He does, however, have
impeccable taste in pipes.)  One last preface to this "guide" so that you
know my own background and biases.  I have recently returned to Columbus
from about two years on California's Central Coast, and I am delighted with
our weather. Now that you know I can lie, I can proceed with this with a
clear conscience.  [Ed: Written in the middle of May.]
 
I will deal mainly with California wines, with perhaps brief references to
other country's wines that are in some way comparable.  Although I believe
we make in many, many cases the finest wines in the world, I also
personally normally enjoy my pipes in the cooler weather or on cool
evenings in the warmer months.  Likewise, in many cases a red wine seems to
go slightly better with smoking a pipe--but certainly not all the time.  So
I will cover reds, whites, and roses and give some specific
recommendations.  But for each specific recommendation, I could also give
at least 10-20 others, so don't worry about trying to get the specific
wine.
 
Briefly, California wines are named for the type of grape used-- i.e., the
varietal.  For example, Merlot is a type of grape, so a Merlot wine is made
principally from this grape (over 75% as a minimum percentage in the wine).
There are a few "proprietary" labels or names of wines that usually use a
mixture of grapes, such as "Bill's Blend."  So you see, there is a lot in
common with the naming of tobaccos.
 
REDS   
 
Cabernet Sauvignon is considered the biggest, fullest, most robust wine.
So choose a full tobacco--for instance, a good English/Turkish blend such
as Lane's Crown Achievement.  Cabernet Sauvignon is dry and can have a wide
range of "flavors" consisting of herbs, flowers, and mint.  Great choices
would be from the wineries of Heitz (expensive), BV (nice and very
available), Robert Mondavi, and Iron Horse.
 
Merlot is a much softer wine on the palette than Cabernet Sauvignon.
Probably a better choice than Cabernet for most people.  It also would go
better with less-robust tobaccos of the mild to medium type.  Again, my
choice might be an English blend, such as Dunhill 965 or Germain's Margate.
Virginia lovers fill in their favorite.  Try a Chappellet Merlot from Napa
Valley if you can ever find it.  Otherwise, there are many available, such
as Alexander Valley.
 
Pinot Noir is the "feminine" soft wine in all the very best senses, a
description that I hope offends no one.  I personally consider it the
finest grape but also the hardest to find an excellent wine made from.  The
very best and most expensive wines in the world from Burgundy in France
come from this grape. Lovely, soft, beautiful bouquet of flowers and other
essences are there.  The best overall American Pinot Noirs come from the
north central coasts of California and Oregon.  Try a bottle of Qupe with a
fire and your favorite tobacco, perhaps one of the excellent blends from
McClelland, such as Bombay Court (English/Turkish/Latakia) or an aged
Virginia that has smoothed out--and dream.  Another good lower-price bottle
usually comes from Parducci.
 
Petite Sirah is a spicy red, one of my favorites.  Here again, Parducci
makes an excellent one for about $6.00--a definite best buy.  Qupe is
usually great but more expensive.  I just finished some Parducci last night
with Pembrook cognac flavored from Germain &amp; Sons.
 
Napa Gamay or Gamay Beaujolais is a lighter, fruity fresh red that is
usually served slightly chilled.  It can have a bouquet of flowers or
berries and is a perfect "picnic" summer wine.  So enjoy it with a "summer"
tobacco, perhaps Dunhill's Early Morning.  Early Morning will also go well
with a chilled bottle of Berringer Beaujolais Noveau when it is first
released from the winery, usually in early autumn.
 
Zinfandel is perhaps my favorite California wine.  It is unique to
California.  The types vary widely from pale, light, nondescript to robust,
full, late-harvest desert wines that taste like Port.  But my favorites are
the spicy, minty flavored medium ones from Ridge, Ravenswood, and Caymus.
But don't pass up the widely available ones from Sutter Home and especially
Robert Mondavi, which every supermarket carries. One of my most memorable
pipe smoking experiences occurred recently when I smoked a bowl of Margate
in a giant old GBD Unique on a cool evening with a real fireplace going.
 
In the next newsletter, I'll briefly continue this coverage with whites and
roses.  But as a preview, and since it may even be warm (but raining) when
you are reading this, a chilled rose would be perfect with that summer
Virginia or English blend.  Try "Eye of the Toad"--a Pinot Noir Rose from
Toad Hollow Winery, run by Robin Williams' brother, Todd.  Nice and dry
with roses, etc. coming off its bouquet.  Actually, probably great on the
deck with a cigar of your choice!  Cheers. --John

   Thanks very much for the subscription, I enjoyed it greatly.I would also
like to add a fine establishment to your list if your interested in posting
it. This business I visited very often prior to moving to Illinois.
It's,"The pipe and Tobacco Shop, 2908 S. University,Broadmoor Shopping
Center,Little Rock,Ar. 72204.Phone 501-562-PIPE. They have a fine selection
of pipes, cigars and gift items as well as gourmet coffee beans and other
items of interest. A very friendly place very willing to assist the novice
or veteran smoker.Northen-seas is an aromatic I still purchase from them by
mail order. They will gladly send a catalog to any interested party and mail
orders are welcome. It doesn't have the ambience of Georgetown Tobacco in DC
but the selection is comparable.

Thanks,

Steve,

I don't know your policy about announcing new commercial WWW sites on your
mailing list but I thought I would try anyway.  

We just launched a commercial cigar site that you might be interested in.
Robert Langsam (the guy who publishes The Double Corona) finally has his own
site on the Web. His entire catalog, newsletters, cigar reviews and the like
can be found at this URL.  

<a href="http://www.cigar-heaven.com/">http://www.cigar-heaven.com/</a>

The catalog is kind of small but the last time I called he had over 100,000
cigars in his humidor; so if you order from him you are likely to be able to
get whatever is on the list.  He has online ordering and the site will be
secure by the end of August.

Thanks.

Tom Suhadolnik

[ Commercial announcements are fine, as long as they're brief,
tasteful, and not repeated too often (as yours was).  See the
introductory message sent to new members.  I've listed Robert's Web

<a name="39">Subject: High altitude, Bed and Breakfasts, expensive bowlful of tobacco</a>

Hello Steve:  My wife and I recently returned from a very relaxing few 
days in Taos, NM.  I remember some comments in past issues re: bed and 
breakfasts and pipe-smoking acceptance and want to report that La Posada 
de Taos 309 Juanita Lane, Taos, NM 87571 800.645.4803 is quite pipe 
friendly to smoking in the garden area but not in the rooms proper 
(remember that you are a guest in their home).  Bill and Nancy Swan are 
the proprietors and very gracious hosts.  Highly recommended (even if you 
aren't a pipe smoker.) 

I noticed that I had more trouble keeping my pipe lit at Taos (elevation 
approx 6900 ft ASL)  Is this a reflection of the lower oxygen content at 
higher elevations or my poor technique?  Comments anyone?

Finally, my last bowlful of Dunbar in Taos was the most expensive ever.  My 
wife and I were relaxing in the garden with books and a pipe when she looked 
up and asked me to put out the pipe and go look at a ring she found 
attractive on our first window-shopping expedition in Taos Plaza. To 
make a long story short, I ended up buying the ring as an early 
25th anniversary present and went back to my 2/3 bowlful of Dunbar. I 
really savored that pipe!!  Any other Pipe Digest readers have 
experience with expensive bowlsful of tobacco?    

((Steve, this is meant as a submission to Pipe Digest.  Please advise 
on acceptability etc.))

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ Thanks for the info, Bruce! I've phoned La Posada and asked Nancy to
send me a brochure.  In the spirit of Prof. Einstein's quote, if
things work out, Jeanette and I are tentatively planning to be there
for a good view of Comet Hale-Bopp, which should be at perigee early
next spring.  (And since Taos is in the high desert and New Mexico is
a "dark-sky" area, the seeing should be much better than murky New
Jersey!)

Any interest in planning a Digestian rendezvous there at that time? -S. ]

Thanks to all for the kind messages about my father.

[MYSTERY] Those of a Sherlockian bent might have noticed something
special about the number of this issue!  In honor of the event, I've
scanned in an article from John Hall of the Northern Musgraves,
entitled "140 Different Varieties" -- a detailed report on the use of
tobacco in the Sherlock Holmes canon.  The original was sent to me by
Tom Dunn, editor of _The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris_, and is a worthwhile
read for anyone contemplating a trip to the gas-lamps and moors.
Although it's too long to include in the Digest, Steve Beaty has given
it a berth on the Web page, <a href="http://www.pipes.org.">http://www.pipes.org.</a>  Or I can mail you a
copy if you don't have Web access.

[CD-ROM] The work is going along, though slowly at the moment.  I'd
like to include some pictures, and have therefore acquired a scanner
(and am attempting to get Photoshop installed, though that is having
some difficulty.)  Tom Dunn has given me permission to scan in
pictures from the _Ephemeris_.  If you have any pictures you'd like to
include (which are free of copyright encumberances), please mail them
to me.  (Snail address provided upon request -- I'd like to keep track
of whom that goes to.)

I might be able to get sponsors for a pipes digest cd-rom.

One of my clients is a fairly famous mail-order wine shop, this would be
something that might interest him.

Another possibility would be Fuji Publishing, I am sure he would pay to
have his wine and cigar guides on the CD.

I would also pay to have my services listed.

Dear Steve,

First, condolences on the loss of your father.

Next:  I have read a few references to Swan Vesta matches in PD.  I also 
noticed Dan Rather using one to light a cigar in a recent issue of 
Cigar Aficionado.  Now I'm curious:  can you or someone else familiar 
with these briefly explain just what it is that makes them so 
desirable?  And is there any way to get them these days?

Finally, I'd like to pass on a couple of personal recommendations, 
for what they're worth.  
  -  Of the several tobacco shops in Manhattan, I've found 
Barclay-Rex (42nd St., across from Grand Central) to be the most 
pleasant place to hang out and have a smoke.  The staff is 
refreshingly free of the kind of "attitude" that can be found at some 
of the other midtown establishments.  
  -  In New Haven, Conn., cigar-friendly establishments include 
Richter's on Chapel Street (great tap beer and single-malt Scotch 
selections), Elm City Brewing's Brew Pub restaurant at the brewery 
on Grand Avenue (a dozen or so freshly-brewed beers on tap at all 
times), and Scoozi's outdoor patio area, also on Chapel Street (good 
Italian food and wine).

Best wishes and good smoking to all.

Greetings Steve,

	Glad to see my CD-Rom idea went over well. I would be glad to help who
ever works on this idea. In fact I have many more ideas for it as well. Send
them my way.
	Question: Most pipes today come 'ready to smoke' ,is the term
'pre-char'?  What is the process they use to do this? I have seen
several pipes recently at my local store that are not ready to smoke,
what are the schools of thought on 'breaking in' pipes?
	Once again thanks for a wonderful DIgest- a true labor of
love. Smoke in Peace, my friend.

?????.????@??????????.???

[ I believe "pre-carbonized" is the term; a thin layer of carbon is
deposited on the inside of the bowl.  Some folks advocate wetting the
inside of the bowl or coating it with honey during break-in, but
personally I've never found that to be necessary.  And for other
issues on break-in, see the following two articles.  Thanks! -S. ]

<a name="7">Subject: Pipes Digest</a>

From: John E. Kelso, San Jose, CA.

As a new guy to the group, I first want to say hello.  I'm so very glad 
to have found you, and have enjoyed reading the back issues of the 
Digest.  I'm a 30 year veteran pipe smoker, and have worked off-and-on 
part-time in pipe and tobacco shops (mostly for the fun of being around 
other folks who appreciate pipes, while incidentally picking up the 
spare change to buy an occasional fine pipe).  I have also been one of 
those who has sometimes lapsed into cigarette smoking (having picked-up 
the gasper habit while serving in the Army).  In a future contribution I 
will have a few words to say about my final successful effort to put 
aside the gaspers forever (well, some 12 years ago, anyway).  

When I look over my pipes, I notice that without any real conscious 
effort to do so, I have built a "collection" with some particular 
characteristics.  I have picked up mostly freehand pipes, and they seem 
to be predominantly Danish in origin.  There are a number of Ben Wades, 
several Preben Holms (rest their smoky souls), a few Baris, quite a long 
list of pieces from the catalog of Erik Nording's work,  and a couple of 
very special W.O. Larsens.  These Danish pipes are complimented with 
exceptions from other lands -- a favorite Mauro Armellini, a Butz 
Chaquin, and a truly wonderful freehand HW Custom straight-grain with a 
natural burl top that extends as an unbroken bridge over the whole bowl 
and across to the briar stem.  What do I smoke in these?  Well, I've had 
my flings with all types of tobacco, but for many years now, I have 
settled on straight (non-aromatic) cavendish tobacco (Amphora Regular, 
brown pouch, for example) which manages to feed my sweet tooth without 
giving me too much of the bitterness and tongue-bite that the heavily 
flavored cavendish blends do.  

Now that I've made my introductions, I'll jump right in and stretch your 
hospitality to the limits with an opinion piece, which may prove 
controversial,  on an aspect of our hobby about which I've collected my 
observations for many years.

          HEEL CAKE: THE HOLY GRAIL OF PIPE-SMOKERS
Pipe smoking should be an enjoyable activity.  That it is not always so 
is an unfortunate fact.  Strangely, of all the things that conspire to 
take joy away from smoking a pipe, none has been so insidious, and none 
has caused so many smokers to puff away for so long at so many 
nasty-tasting pipes, as the one thing that pipe smokers have placed on 
their own heads:   the quest to build the perfect heel cake in briar 
pipes.

The quest for the perfect heel cake has been the bane of many pipe 
smokers for generations. Laying down such a thing in one's pipes has 
been promoted as a necessary step in becoming an accomplished pipe 
smoker, as if it were our equivalent of  the medieval knight's quest for 
the Holy Grail.  Like unto the history of that ancient search for the 
mystical artifact, there are numerous smoker's claims to having seen the 
elusive heel cake, and even a few smokers who claim to have actually 
captured it themselves.  To these I say with all respect, "I much doubt 
it." 

First, a few words about cake in general.  The build-up over time along 
the walls of the pipe bowl of a layer of crystallized pure carbon is a 
serendipitous consequence of the physics of combustion in a pipe which 
savvy smokers put to good use.  When we allow that carbon build-up to 
take place and carefully trim it from time to time so that it remains 
even and goes far down into the bowl, we help preserve our briar pipes 
and improve the taste of them as well.  This carbon layer acts as a 
fire-wall between the burning tobacco and the wood of the pipe itself. 
When we smoke a pipe, we really don't want to be smoking the pipe  -  we 
want to be smoking tobacco.  A good layer of hard carbon prevents the 
briarwood from becoming involved in the combustion process.  A pipe with 
a good cake is well preserved from having the fire attack the integrity 
of the pipe itself, and the smoker is protected from smoking the wood 
and resins present in even a well-aged burl.  So a good, even, and deep, 
pure carbon cake is indeed something worth questing for.  But the myth 
of the heel cake takes a good thing to an unnecessary, nearly 
impossible, and undesirable extreme. 

In thirty years of smoking, observing smokers, and working with pipes in 
the repair facilities of tobacconists, I have never seen a true heel 
cake.  Upon examination of the pipes of smokers who have claimed to have 
achieved heel cake, I have invariably found in the heel one of two 
things:  either charred briar, or  -  not the same hard carbon casing 
which lines the vertical walls of the of the pipe's barrel  -  but a 
softer, almost rubbery mass of collected gunk.  This is not carbon cake 
in its proper sense at all, but is instead only a partially heat-cured 
collection of the hydrocarbon juices produced from burning tobacco. Such 
a mess contributes nothing to the smoking experience beyond bad odor and 
nasty taste.  The effort given to producing this false cake requires 
that the smoker endure the unpleasantness of finishing many otherwise 
enjoyable smokes with a gritty and bitter chaser.

The physics of combustion in a smoking pipe ought to be enough to 
demonstrate the impossibility of a smoker building a heel cake in his 
pipe in the same way it is built along the pipe's vertical wall.  The 
common advice for building heel cake is to smoke the tobacco all the way 
down to the (literally) bitter end.  The technique assumes that cake is 
made up of burned tobacco, but this is not the actual case.  The true 
cake which forms along the inside of the barrel is not tobacco, but 
crystallized carbon which only forms under very extreme conditions 
where, under intense heat, the vaporized products of combustion interact 
with moving air jets to produce carbon plasma which eventually 
sublimates against the relatively cool wall of the pipe into 
crystallized carbon.  The plasma and the hot gasses of combustion cool 
as they are drawn toward the bottom of the pipe.  For this same reaction 
to occur in the bottom, or heel, of the pipe would require that the 
smoker draw plasma and flame far out into the stem of the pipe.  
Friends, nobody does this without serious consequences.  We are smokers, 
not fire eaters.  So, anything that collects in the heel at or below the 
level of the stem hole is going to be chemically more like soft asphalt 
than it will be to the hard carbon cake we quest for.

The point I want to make is the one with which I began:  Pipe smoking 
should be an enjoyable activity.  Building the carbon cake on the 
vertical walls of your briar pipes is something to be done with 
reasonable care because the benefit is great.  But forget about the 
mythical heel cake.  A good cake tapers down to nothing right at the 
level at which the stem hole comes into the bowl.  Don't smoke below 
this level, and clean out the gunk which collects down there.  Absent 
the trials of the mythical quest, your level of frustration will come 
down, and your smoking enjoyment will go up.  

Peace,   JEK

Hi Steve,

I just finished PD #220, and want to thank you again for providing 
this wonderful publication.

Bijan Kafi asked for recommendations of good aromatic tobaccos 
available in Germany.  Thanks to Frank Glenewinkel, who gets the PD 
in Germany, I've been able to sample a number of tobaccos available 
there.  Von Eicken has been producing tobacco in Germany since 1770, 
and imho offers excellent blends. I recently received a tin of von 
Eicken Tradition 225, and it is a wonderful aromatic, and quite 
unusual. The closest thing to it I've ever tried is Rose and Crown, 
by Stanwell. It has a wonderful aroma, almost a perfume, in the tin, 
but is not overly sweet.  And the quality of the tobacco is very 
high.  I've also liked the von Eicken Varinas Kanaster blend, but 
this may not be what Bijan is looking for, since it is not aromatic, 
and reminds me of a Virginia blend.

I also like Cellini Classico Reservo, which is also an excellent 
aromatic. While it is made in Italy, it is available in Germany. To 
quote from the pack, "A fragrant orange bouquet of delicately cool 
aromatic brillance guarantees superb smoking pleasure."  I find it 
interesting that the tobaccos in this mixture were grown in Tuscany 
and Umbria.  I was unaware that any tobacco was grown in Western 
Europe. Would any PD readers know how long this has been going on?

Two other German tobaccos I have enjoyed are Lotzbect Latakia 
Melange, which despite its name is NOT an English blend but a very 
nice aromatic, and Graf Luckner mixture.  These are widely available, 
being "kiosk" blends, their equivalent of our drugstore blends, but 
both are very good.

I would recommend that any German pipe smokers get a copy of the Dan 
Pipe catalog.  I have never seen anything to compare with the 
presentation, photography, selection and general quality this catalog 
in the USA.  Unfortunately (for me, but not for those who read 
German) it is printed in German. I think anyone who can order from it 
will find much to keep them happily smoking for ages.

On another topic - burnouts - which was mentioned more than once in 
PD #220,  I read some interesting information about it on Mark 
Tinsky's American Smoking Pipe home page 
(<a href="http://www2.AmSmoke.com/AmSmoke)">http://www2.AmSmoke.com/AmSmoke)</a>
Mark suggests never lighting a pipe you are breaking in with a 
lighter. It seems it may produce too hot a burn at the bottom of the 
uncaked bowl. As a matter of fact, he recommends always using 
matches.  I'd never heard of this connection between lighters and 
bowl burnout before.

Best wishes to you and all the PD subscribers,
Spencer Schein

[ I've never burned out a properly made pipe, but have noticed that
lighters tend to char the top of the bowl. -S. ]

On a recent camping trip to somewhere in Pennsylvania, my friend and I
broght along some Montecristo cigars for some late night smoking. First
off, we smoked an immense Primo Del Rey he had kept for a few months. It
was very light and grassy, and barely any smoke, but it was great. On the
trail to the lake aroun one in the morning, we found a nice spot to light
up. We smoked a $9.50 Montecristo cigar. OH, it was GREAT! It was creamy
and had a complexity of flavors and an imcomparable aroma. It took almost
an hour to smoke completely..... It was definitely worth it. It was the
best cigar I have ever had. My friend also brought along his cheap pipe
and pipe tobacco, and that wasn't too bad... But we have to get the good
stuff from Fader's......

Steve,

I would like to thank you for your off-hand remark in digest #219 about how
to renew old tobacco.  My dads father was a pipe smoker for many years and
passed on shortly after I married (July  1973).  His pipe "stuff" was passed
on to my mothers father as he was also a pipe smoker.  When he left us I
inherited the collection.  I have had in my posession a tin foil bag of
tobacco that belonged to my dads father that was pretty dry and I thought was
useless, but I kept it around since it reminded me of him.  Every once in a
while I would open it and savor the smell for the memories it would bring.
 When you mentioned the tip about renewing old tobacco I decided to try it
out.  
I scrounged up one of my wife's tupperware and applied the remedy not sure if
it would work.  This was custom tobacco and at least 26 years old.  Lo and
behold  when I opened the top it it was like I had just purchased it.  Sweet
and moist.  I waited until the house was clear and filled up a bowl in my
favorite pipe and sat on the front porch and lit up.  What a beautiful
fragrance and taste, and the memories brought a tear to my eye.  After all
those years I could almost sense his presence.  
Thanks again for bringing back my Grandpa.

<a name="16">Subject: Smoke Signal [PIPE]</a>

    Years ago, in my beardless days, when I had difficulty controlling the
pitch of my voice, I joined-up, as they say and likely still do. We
bailed out of the troop-train at Cosford Halt, me and several hundred
other spotty-faced youths, apprentices to the Royal Air Force. We
harangued the army wallahs on the train and someone shouted: "Where the
Army goes pongoes." We thought this the height of wit for the army boys
were known by that collective noun -- pongo. It wasn't until much later
that I discovered that early writers used "pongo" to refer to the
large, anthropoid African ape -- the Chimpanzee or Gorilla -- much to
my further amusement. We were formed-up into a semblance of order, a
rag-tag bunch, and marched to our quarters in Fulton Block where we
were told to pick a bed and stow our kit. We were visited by a
middle-aged Flight Sergeant who took his pipe from his mouth to
pronounce: "Cleanliness is next to Godliness." And that we were to
perform our ablutions each day, and that we were to write home to mummy
and daddy each week because he didn't want to be receiving telephone
calls from anxious parents wanting to know what had become of their
precious son. His pipe was full-bent, something from Capp and Peterson
as I recall.

    One of my comrades-in-arms was Peter Brown, an ex-choirboy from
Farnborough. It was through him that I became acquainted with the
Staines Falcon. Now there are several kinds of falcon. Falcons can be
any of various hawks belonging to the avian family Falconidae. The
Maltese Falcon was a bird too, albeit made of lead much to the chagrin
of the Fat Man who I can still see hacking at it with his penknife.

    Lead was the material in which the Maltese Falcon was cast by Dashiell
Hammett: Aluminium is the material in which the Staines Falcon is cast
by Merton &amp; Falcon. Behind the Maltese Falcon was a trail of
destruction, murder, and mayhem: Behind the Staines Falcon, a bouquet.
Embodied in the Maltese Falcon are greed and folly: In the Staines
Falcon are scientific principles and precision engineering needed to
produce a high-tech pipe design.

    Peter Brown had a bent Falcon pipe in which he smoked St. Bruno flake.
Falcon pipes have aluminum stems to cool the smoke, a humidome under
the bowl to condense moisture, a Lucite bit, and a detachable briar
bowl. Each bowl has a four-start thread so that the bowl can be
attached and detached from the stem with a quarter-turn. Five styles of
bowl are available: Standard, De luxe, Hunter, Classic, and Standard
Meerschaum-lined. There are standard pipes, de luxe pipes, Alco pipes,
and a range of other pipe-smoking accessories. If Falcons are not
available at your local tobacconist they can be ordered from Falcon's
mail order department five doors down from 84 Charing Cross Road at:

		G. Smith &amp; Sons,
		74 Charing Cross Road,
		London, WC2H 0BG,
		England, G.B.

    Falcon pipes will appeal to engineering types and people who smoke
aromatic tobaccos. The aromatic tobacco smoker can have several bowls
on hand, one for each type of tobacco. Falcon pipes are rugged,
economical in their use of tobacco because it is possible to smoke down
to the last shred, and they are easy to clean. They need to be kept
clean otherwise they can smell rank. Myself, I have a bent standard and
a curved standard pipe with two or three bowls in which I smoke English
and Scottish blends as the mood takes me. Standard bowls are small,
ideal for a short smoke. Hyperboles are twice as large as the standard
bowl for a longer smoke. Also, there are dry rings that can be
installed in the humidome to absorb moisture. Falcon pipes do not
replace the traditional briar rather they compliment a pipe smoker's
collection and are ideal for the outdoors-man or -women and other persons
on-the-go.

Greetings Steve,

A very special thanks for providing us all with this great resource.  Just 
when I thought that the hours of enjoyable reading and countless pieces of 
invaluable information it provides were enough I get an email from an old 
friend that I haven't seen in ages saying he ran across my name in the digest 
and wanted to know if it was the same Jake Kurdsjuk he grew up with - not that
the name is that common ;-) !  Well it seems that he too has taken to the 
pleasures of the leaf, cigars originally and is now taking up the pipe.  We're
about 100 miles apart but are looking to get together real soon to share a 
bowl or two since he occasionally has reason to travel towards my neck of the 
woods.

Speaking of my neck of the woods, God has finally graced me with a tobacco 
shoppe worth a lick that is within 20 minutes of my house. The Tinder Box has 
opened a store in Bethlehem, PA and it is well stocked and well staffed.  The 
spacious shop has a large humidor lining one wall with a great selection of 
cigars.  The display cases on the opposite wall contain various pipe and cigar
accessories plus a minor amount of the usual tobacco/gift shoppe 
paraphernalia, but not enough to be annoying.  The pipe selection behind and 
under the front counter is a little wanting (compared to the cigars) with 
Comoy's, Peterson and Ascorti representing the bulk of the higher grades, but 
the shoppe has only been open for a couple months and the proprietor, Joe 
Carroll, is more than willing to try and find something if your looking for 
it.  The feature attraction is the smoking lounge in the center of the store. 
Comfortable leather chairs and sofas are full on most evenings (every time 
I've been there), mostly cigar smokers but I did run into a pipie there once. 
It's so nice to have a place near by just to stop in and have a smoke and a 
chat.  The added bonus is that it is located in the same shopping center as 
the Home Depot giving this homeowner a great excuse to head in that direction 
- and the wife doesn't seem to have to nag me about those little things that 
need fixing around the house anymore!  For the resource guide:

If anyone else out there lives in the area and is interested in meeting there 
for a bowl full, either once in a while or possibly on a regular basis, please
let me know.  

Before I go, just wanted to add that I finally added a Preben Holm Ben Wade to

what the rest of you have been saying in the digest it may be a little more 
difficult to come across tham now.  Let's hope not too difficult.

Dear Steve,

Please accept my sincere condolences on the recent loss of your father.

Also on a happier note, I just returned from a conference in Boston that
wound up having some great pipe smoking side benefits.

The meeting was held at the Westin at Copley Place.  The organizers had
selected the Westin, in part, because of its liberal smoking policy, as the
meeting was international and the Europeans would expect to be able to
smoke.  Not only were the cigarette smokers able to smoke at coffee breaks
and in the bar, pipe smoking elicited not a single complaint.  Since I
didn't eat in the Hotel resaurants, I'm not sure what the policy is there.

I phoned Craig Tarler at Cornell &amp; Diehl to order some tobacco, which he
next day courriered to me so I could take it with me to Canada (saves $$ in
customs and taxes when brought home under the personal exemption).  While on
the phone, he mentioned that I was near "one of the best tobacconists in the
world" and told me about Peretti's.

A pleasant walk to Park Square took me to an "old fashioned" pipe store,
with hundreds of pipes on the wall and in display cases, and a knowledgable
pipe smoking salesman.  Even the old practice of lining up choices on the
counter to narrow them down seemed quite in order.  Peretti's makes their
own pipes, as well as stocking a reasonable selection of quality brands.  I
finally selected a large 1/2 bent with a Dublin style bowl, straight to
flame grain on the sides, birdseye front and back, with no visible flaws,
for the very reasonable price of $50.00.  It is breaking in quite easily,
and smokes nicely.

All in all, the trip was a delight from a smoking perspective in these times
of anti-smoking sentiment and disappearing pipe shops.

&gt;&gt;1.  Everyone knows that meerschaum translates to "sea-foam."  Why?  Due to

&gt;&gt;porosity, it will commonly float.  Romantic allusions aside, this seems the
&gt;&gt;most plausible of all the explanations I have seen for the name.

&gt;Actually, in "Tobacco Leaves" (published in 1915 by Index Press), the

&gt;the substance we call meerschaum was thought to be fossilized sea-foam
&gt;(!) I don't have the book in front of me, but there are references to
&gt;other publications that he cites as his sources. If you would like

Hi, I have reciently started smoking a pipe. After admiring others and 
enjoying the aeroma I decided to try the taste.
I have started with a cheap corncob pipe loaded with cheap cherry flavored 
tobaco.
I plan on trying several different brands and types of tobaco to find the 
one that I like,and mabey I'll get another pipe to try that route.
I currently smoke menthol cigarettes and am getting tired of smoking an 
entire cigerette before I throw it away. I figured that I can get the same 
feeling out of a pipe as a cig.,not as much waste.

I would like to get in on your mailing list.

<a name="23">Subject: Pipes &amp; Flyfishing</a>

Hi Steve:

In the past couple of Digests,  Mark Tinsky has referred to his pipesmoking
experiences while flyfishing.  As a veteran flyfisherman, I have had my own
adventures/misadventures.

Any flyfisherman knows the difficulty of casting well when the wind is roily.
 The wind can hurl your flyline in a contrary direction to what you intend.
 For instance, I have had many occasions, casting into a headwind, when my
fly and leader were blown into a tree branch 30 feet overhead.  There are
techniques used to avoid this happening, but sometimes the terrain is not
conducive.  (For readers not acquainted with flyfishing, the "fly" is
propelled by the weight of the flyline, as the fly itself has a negligible
weight.  In spin casting, the weight of the lure/bait pulls the line out from
the rod.)

Once, while flyfishing, I decided to enjoy a bowl.  I pulled out an E. Andrew
canadian pipe that I purchased from Uhle's in Milwaukee.  I was alone on the
Moose River (near Moosehead Lake, here in Maine).  The fish weren't biting
particularly well, but I was inwardly placid as I puffed on a bowl of
Davidoff Oriental Mixture.  Rather suddenly, the weather changed.  The sky
looked threatening, and the wind became very gusty.  The current was quite
strong and the water level was nearly 4 feet, where I was fishing.  I slowly
worked my way shoreward, while continuing to cast.  The wind got ahold of my
flyline and hurled it into a massive spruce whose branches overhung the
river.  I gently tugged at my line, hoping to free it.  I stumbled over a
submerged rock and dropped me, my rod, and pipe into the churning river.  I
bobbed along in the current.  As I struggled to regain my footing, I noticed
my pipe downstream from me.  It was beyond reach, and then it disappeared
forever.

Fortunately, I retrieved my flyrod, still hooked onto the spruce.  By this
time, it was getting dark and a thunderstorm started.  I decided to call it a
day.

Unfortunately, I got lost in the  black woods, heading back to the car.
 After a few hours of bushwhacking, I finally found the river again.  (It was
raining so hard, I could no longer hear the river while in the woods.)  I
walked upriver, falling flat on my face in the water several times, for about
a mile until I reached the bridge where I parked my  car.  

I never told my wife that I had purchased "another pipe" and so I didn't feel
obligated to tell her that I lost said pipe.  But from then on, I never
smoked a 1st quality pipe while flyfishing again.

Anyway, for tobacconists in SF I've found Sherlock's Haven at 1 Embarcadero

tobacco. My two favorite blends are from Sherlock's: King's Cross and Bar

Hi Steve,

Great job on the digest. I would also be interested in a CD ROM format.  

I have a question.  I have a Savinelli Autograph 5.  When I purchased it
with it was a package of "filters" which look like long triangular pieces of
balsa wood.  The pipe shop where I purchased it didn't inform me about any
filters.  I have just been smoking it without.  Is there some hidden
compartment where this filter resides?  I can't find it unless the stem base
srews out of the bowl some how.  If anyone has an idea of how these filters
are used or if they should not be used or if they just don't belong with the
pipe I would appreciate the enlightenment.

I am also in search of the "best blend" tobacco.  I tend to lean towards
aromatics.  The closest source I have is a tinderbox.   Do the big pipe
shows tend to have vendors with samples to try?  Would that be my best
avenue to start searching?  I have contacted a couple of mail order vendors
for some samples(not free) but I end up paying 1/3 of the total cost in
shipping ect.  I have not found a pipe show that is close enough for me to
justify taking a weekend (mini vacation w/wife and 4 kids).  Bill Unger
advertises his clubs in Ohio.  That is as close to Iowa as I have seen.
There used to be one in Chicago.  Oh well that is also part of the fun of
this pastime!

Dear Steve,
I am sorry that I have never joined your club but I have a friend that lets
me read the news now and then.
I would not have bothered you at all but I was passing a tobacconist in my
home town of Melbourne, Australia, and noticed something quite strange. A
Pipe Sale.
On further inspection, this store had BBB's from England at less than half
the price I bought mine for and a Peterson 2 times cheaper than I paid for
last week somewhere else.
I had to enquire.
The owner told me that an old pipe importer died leaving his niece with a
warehouse full of Pipes that she has no use for.
I bought a BBB Tasman for $20 and asked for a card.
The shop is called Benjamin's Fine Tobacco
The address is:
Shop 10
Strand Central
250 Elizabeth St
Melbourne  3000
Victoria
Australia

Phone  61 3 9663 2879
Fax    61 3 9663 2181

I don't know if they have an Email address but it seems they have about
1000 pipes they are selling cheaply.
If think you members could use this info, fine.
Thought the information would be of help.

Paul Parker

[ Indeed; I won't list this in the Guide, since they are selling out
their stock, but it might well be worthwhile! -S. ]

<a name="31">Subject: Weeping Shank</a>

Steve,  I read with pained empathy Rick Larson's question in PD#220 
regarding a weeping shank on his beloved Mastro de Paja.  I concur with 
your diagnosis that a crack has probably opened up on the shank.  You 
suggested that the accepted repair would be to put on a band.  Again, I 
concur.  However, allow me to propose an alternative solution -- 
install a bamboo shank.
 
I had a similar occurrence with a beloved Algerian briar which was the 
finest, coolest and driest smoking pipe in my collection.  I brought my 
beloved weeping Algerian to Ron at the Wharf in Beavercreek, Ohio.  I was 
disconsolate, but I was hoping for a miracle.
 
After inspecting the subject and considering various alternatives, Ron 
and I agreed that the pipe would be exceedingly handsome with a bamboo shank.  
We were absolutely right.  Not only is my beloved Algerian handsome with 
its new bamboo shank, but it smokes cooler and drier than ever.  
I have two other similar pipes in my collection that are currently undergoing 
bamboo transplants, despite the fact that they did not suffer from weeping 
shanks.
 
I know that an extensive modification like adding a bamboo shank 
compromises the collectors value of these pipes and significantly changes 
the pipemaker's original intent and design.  But after all is said and done, 
they are now _my_ pipes.  Moreover, one bowlful of tobacco convinced me that 
the benefits were worth the risk of being called a Philistine by the purists.

several changes of e-mail address, always with some sort of forwarding, but 
I need to get to the real one that will be more or less permanent.

time to write a bit.  It haas always been a pleasure, and I feel bad not 
having written before.  This will be short, but I hope I can send more in 
the future.  

I have been in Paul's Pipe Shop in Flint, Michigan, twice in the past month. 
The Guide says "rumored to be legendary," and the description fits.  It's 
well worth the 70 mile drive from Detroit, and probably worth 700 miles at 
least, since it really is a TOBACCO shop.  None of the Mall junk.  And a 
geat selection of pipes, tobaccos, and cigars, with all sorts of 
accessories.  Early in the month was the 68 cent sale, celebrating 68 years 
in business; buy one pipe at regular price, the second is 68 cents.  What a 
buy on two great-looking bulldogs, one of Algerian briar.

Flint will be the site of the IASPC meeting in October.  I will be sure to 
be there, and I hope to be able to put faces with many of the names I have 
been reading for the past months.

More later.

&gt; certainly wouldn't be enough to justify a volume run.  I've also
&gt; learned that there are _two_ cigar CD-ROMs on the market now, so our
&gt; product wouldn't be unique.  So my plan now is to first assemble a
&gt; CD-ROM with the Web page materials and some scans (keeping it simple),
&gt; and then accumulate orders and do a small run maybe every six months.

Steve:

Just a note to let you know that I would be a subscriber.  Also if you 
run it at 6 months intervals consider including a compilation of 
alt.smokers.pipes messages and, if possible, the CompuServe base.  Given 
the room perhaps you could also include a 'want ad' or buy/sell area.
Another area that comes to mind would be scan contributions of old 
catalogues and leaflets - I seem to always be down in my basement 
digging through my pile of s___ in search of that two page flyer from 
twenty years ago that I dimly recall described some now obscure tobacco 
blend or pipe - hitting the "next" button on my CPU would be a lot 
easier.  I guess I chopped off the Hacker tag to your response above but 
that would be nice, if only because the book's lack of an index 
seriously limits its long term usefulness.  Thank heavens for the bound 
volume Ephemeris indexes - but still CD ROM search capabilities would be 
better, although it really would be a task to scan and convert to ASCII.

[ The second edition of the Hacker tag has an index, John.  And while
scanning brochures in would be a nice idea, I'll have to limit the
scope of the CD-ROM project somewhat, so it can be completed in among
the myriad details of job, home, etc. that keep clamoring for my
attention!  The "140 Varieties" article, for instance, took me three
hours to scan and convert; the photos will probably take a long time
to touch up, even with Photoshop. (BTW, any tips on doing this

Hello Steve and Pipsters!
I Have a question to submit to everyone could answer.
During my perpetual research for good pipes( to smoke first but
also to collect),it happened to me to find and buy an unsmoked
Caminetto with the tipical "moustache" on the stem painted Gold.
I knew that maybe it refers to the gold period of this firm since
in 1980 it splitted out and after refounded but with a
significative difference either in quality either in the
collecting value due to the fact that the team was not the
founding team.
This pipe is stamped with "Caminetto BUSINNES 108".
I tried to found something in Rick Hacker's Book but for
Caminettos there are not much informations.
Is anyone aware of this firm's story?

Just came across a new pipe repairer:

Bill Braddock
Bill's Pipe Repair
2909 SW 52nd Place
Oklahoma City, OK 73119
405 682 1558

I had an ancient Soren with a broken shank which he repaired so that 
you have to use a glass to see the joint. He's also done some other 
repairs and stem replacement. He's very good, quick and reasonable.

I have no connection other than as a satisfied customer.

Greetings Steve and PD Readers,

After a painfully long absence from this group (and a.s.p), I am happy
to report that my family and I are finally settled in at beautiful, 
sunny, Ft Irwin, CA.  For those of you who haven't heard of this garden 
spot, we are located 20 miles south of Death Valley National Monument 
and 45 miles north of the nearest town (Barstow, CA).  We get a 
whopping 3 inches of rain a year here, and summer highs hover around 
115 degrees or so.  Fortunately, we spent 4 years here--'86 to '90--so 
we knew what expect.

Since the nearest town is a long distance call away, I had given up any 
hope of finding an Internet service provider.  Fortunately, a good 
friend located a provider that offers 1-800 access for a *very* 
reasonable fee.  It's very good to be back.

My home page has also found a new home, thanks to my "baby" brother,
Home Depot's newest communications engineer:

<a href="http://www.atlcom.net/~drlathem/pipes/">http://www.atlcom.net/~drlathem/pipes/</a>

It had lost something in the translation, but I think it's finally back 
up to speed now.  I added a couple of additional links and got rid of 
my personal pages section; the intent was not to snub others' pages, 
but Steve Beaty does a much better job of keeping track of these than I
possibly could.  I also added another Ephemeris exerpt, "The Black
Dudeen."  It's a terrific little poem, reminiscent of Kipling, that I
had somehow overlooked previously.

One bit of good news; on the day I arrived here I learned that I have 
been selected for promotion to Major (for those who may not know, I'm 
a US Army officer).  To celebrate, I've asked Mark Tinsky to make a 
special pipe for me:  a duplicate of the Randy Wiley pipe that is 
featured at the bottom of page 63 of the second edition of Hacker's 
book (the pipe in the foreground).  I had considered asking Jim Cooke 
to do the work--he did a phenomenal job with two other pipes over the 
past year or so--but, after seeing much of Mark's work on the web and 
after reading of his successful "two-bowl" model, I decided to ask Mark 
to do it instead.  I'll be sure to let the group know how it turns out 
(no pressure, Mark &lt;BG&gt;).

Again, it's great to be back, and if anyone knows of any shows in the 
Los Angeles/San Diego/San Bernadino/Las Vegas area any time in the 
coming months (unfortunately, I missed the July LA Show), *please* drop 
me a line.

Regards,

Steve,

My protracted absence from the Internet gave me a great deal of time to 
ponder the great mysteries of life.  (My lovely wife, Teresa,
affectionately refers to this activity as "sitting on your butt.")
During this period I composed a number of short essays which will
someday be incorporated into my memoirs.  My decision to leave all the
proceeds from the sale of this future work to my heirs has done much to
assuage my guilt at spending all of their inheritance on pipes and
tobacco.  Below is a small sample of my writing; this subject has been 
previously addressed by others, but I felt that I had a thing or two to 
add.

BTW, does anyone know of a foolproof (and I do mean *foolproof*) means
to remove one's tongue from one's cheek?

======================================================================

                WHY PIPES ARE BETTER THAN CIGARS...
                -----------------------------------

Before anyone gets their nose out of joint, let me say that there 
is absolutely *nothing* wrong with cigars.  I smoke cigars on
occasion, myself, and I enjoy them very much (honest).  I also have 
tremendous respect for any pastime that furthers the responsible 
use of fine tobacco.  Still, there are a number of reasons why pipes 
are unquestionably *better*.

Reason #1:  Variety.  The range of pipe tobaccos is phenomenal.  
Even discounting "aromatic" (artificially flavored) blends, the 
variety of pipe tobacco flavors is greater than that of cigars by a 
huge margin.  Ethereal subtleties of flavor aside, a cigar will always 
taste like a cigar.

Reason #2:  Pipes.  This reason, in and of itself, is  sufficient to 
forgo cigar smoking.  Pipes are *beautiful* things, nothing short of 
functional works of art.  For the price of dinner and a movie, you can 
purchase a lovely pipe that will bring you decades of pleasure.  For a 
few weeks salary, you can purchase a sculpture in briar that will make 
your cronies green with envy.  Collecting such marvelous things is a 
truly noble pursuit, and one can never have enough pipes.  Here's one 
hint:  when your spouse asks you, "Why do you need *all those* pipes?" 
it means that they have lost track of the actual number that you do 
own.  You are now free to purchase as many pipes as you choose.  Of 
course, turnabout is fair play; I'm reasonably certain that my wife has 
successfully used this same tactic with shoes...

Reason #3:  Paraphenalia.  What do all great hobbies have in common?  
*Gadgets.*  Cigar smokers have humidors, cutters, lighters, cases, and 
distinctive ashtrays.  Save cutters, pipe smokers have all of these 
things, plus cleaners, racks, tampers, reamers, pipe tools, shank 
brushes, etc.  And I thought fly fishing was fun.  Actually, I'm 
currently working on a design for a pipe-smoking vest...

Reason #4:  Skill.  Face it; you can give any Tom, Dick, or Jane off 
the street a cigar and a box of matches and he or she will manage to 
convert the cigar to ash with little difficulty.  Give the same person 
a pipe and the results will likely be quite different.  It takes 
*skill* to smoke a pipe.  To properly pack and smoke a bowl is an act 
of performance art.  Lesser men have been known to slink away in utter 
shame upon watching a skilled pipe smoker put his briar into action.

Reason #5:  Economy.  For the price of a single Cuban, I can purchase 
a two-week supply of the finest pipe tobacco in the world, and--for 
the time being--it's legal.  The money saved can then be immediately 
transformed into more pipes.  Anybody besides me see the inherent 
beauty in this system?  If so, could you please explain it to my wife?

Reason #6:  People.  Pipe smokers are the world's greatest folks--
brilliant, erudite, and kind.  Cigar smokers tend to be nice people, 
too, but you must admit that they also have some real stinkers in 
their ranks.  You should see some of the nasty e-mail I get...

======================================================================

support... -S. ]

Steve,

Download received.  Looking forward to reading.  I'm a Peterson pipe
collector &amp; smoker of some 12+ years now, thought I've been smoking
pipes for almost 34 years off &amp; on.  I also smoke Dunhills, although
I've tried many others, both free-hand and classic.  I have a few
meerschaums which I also like.  I don't smoke these very often as I
never seem to have the precious time to sit &amp; really enjoy the ritual
with these (ha!).  I have about 200+ pipes in my collection, not
bragging - just facts, so I'm beginning to have problems with #1 -
where to display them, #2 - which one to smoke, #3 - when is my
collecting frenzy going to end - probably never &amp; #4 - my wife's
concern that I'm purchasing too many - she says that I can now open a
small tobacco &amp; pipe shop with library with all the tobacco &amp; other
ephemera I have relating to my hobby.  But I still continue to enjoy.

My tobacco taste varies.  It depends on the time of day, what kind of
day it is/ was &amp; what kind of mood I'm in.  Also certain seasons or
holidays call for certain blends.  However, I have found myself
leaning more toward the non-aromatic of late - Dunhill, Erinmore,
others.  I rarely buy over-the-counter tobacco other than Captain
Black - white.  I must say the selection here in my area is small.
I've begun mail-ordering for for some blends I can't purchase at the
local tobacconist.

It's a nice shop - Mall-type - the usual candy, coffee, gift shop, but
they do sell some good tobaccos &amp; have a good selection of pipes.
Also, they will special order, though this can be rather slow.

I'm a member of T.U.C.O.P.S., Fellowship of the White Spot, Peterson's
Smoker's Guild, OOPS &amp; the American Institute of Architects.

Well so much for the short intro.  Will send more later.

Wishes for good smoking to you &amp; yours
Tom

Steve, on Friday, Aug. 2, our local paper ran a picture of Zapatista
leader Sucommander Marcos talking to Danielle Mitterand while smoking a
pipe.  The picture wasn't very good.  I wondered if anyone saw a better
one and could determine what kind of pipe Subcommander Marcos was smoking. 

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Quote of the Week:

  'I have been guilty of several monographs.  They are all upon technical
  subjects.  Here, for example, is one "Upon the Distinction between the
  Ashes of the Various Tobaccos".  In it I enumerate a hundred andforty
  forms of cigar, cigarette, and pipe tobacco, with coloured plates
  illustrating the difference in the ash.  It is a point which is continually
  turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme
  importance as a clue.  If you can say definitely, for example, that some
  murder had been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it
  obviously narrows your field of search.  To the trained eye there is as
  much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white
  fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.'

[ADMIN] I've had recurring trouble sending Digests to the juno.com
ISP, due to the fact that they do not accept mail of the typical
length of the Digest.  If you'd like to receive the Digests on Juno,
please write the postmaster and ask them to provide at least the
services that most competing ISPs do.

[PROHIBITION ALERT] U.S. president Bill Clinton has approved a set of
FDA regulations which will have a negative impact on our hobby. URLs
for the FDA regulations and an excerpt regarding mail-order sales
follow.

The bad news is that the regulations classify nicotine as a drug under
FDA's jurisdiction.  The implications are both obvious and ominous.

The regulations further classify cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as
drug delivery devices, and prohibit mail-order sales of cigarettes and
smokeless tobacco (and impose various other restrictions.)

The not-bad-yet news is that this regulation does not appear to
prohibit mail-order sales of cigars and pipe tobacco.  You can still
buy from JR, C&D, Holt's, Iwan Ries, etc. via mail -- for now.

Of course, we don't know what Clinton and Kessler will do if they both
manage to retain their posts.  But recall that two years after
cigarette advertising was banned from U.S. television, cigars and pipe
tobacco were likewise prohibited.

So let's remember in November.

Clinton to Announce New Anti-Tobacco Measures

WASHINGTON (Reuter) - President Clinton was set Friday to announce a new
series of restrictions on the sale and advertising of tobacco products in
the biggest challenge to cigarette makers in over 30 years.

White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Clinton
would make the announcement during a midday Rose Garden ceremony attended
by a number of anti-smoking, consumer and health groups.

Clinton's aim is to stop what he considers the tobacco industry's attempts
to coax young people into taking up the smoking habit.

He is to approve recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration that
White House officials said closely parallel the proposals the president
sent to the FDA for review last August.

Under those proposals, cigarette companies would be barred from placing
billboard advertising near schools and playgrounds.

He also proposed to require age-verified and face-to-face sales and
eliminate mail-order sales, vending machines, free samples, self-service
displays and sales of fewer than 20 cigarettes.

He also urged that sales or giveaways of caps or gym bags with tobacco
company logos be prohibited, as well as brand-name sponsorship of sporting
or entertainment events.

White House officials said the new regulations will have some modifications
to Clinton's proposals to reflect some of the comments the FDA heard during
a comment period.

Nonetheless, this major set of restraints on the sale and advertising of
tobacco products to minors will mark the first time that the federal
government will have asserted jurisdiction over tobacco products.

It is also the biggest government challenge to the tobacco industry since
the 1964 Surgeon General's report that linked smoking to lung cancer.

Tobacco companies, already facing assault on many fronts, have made clear
they will fight the regulations in court by claiming the FDA does not have
the authority to regulate nicotine.

Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole's spokesman Nelson Warfield
called the announcement an ``election-year gimmick'' that could delay a
teen-smoking crackdown since lawsuits are already pending against Clinton's
proposals.

The Clinton campaign spokesman, Joe Lockhart, fired back that Dole's
criticism showed that he ``seems more interested in protecting the tobacco
lobby than protecting childen.''

Dole had come under heavy criticism in June when he said tobacco was not
necessarily addictive and that he did not believe the FDA has the authority
to regulate nicotine.

The union that represents most tobacco workers said the restrictions could
cost thousands of jobs and eventually prompt tobacco companies to move
operations out of America.

The Freedom to Advertise Coalition, a group of advertising and publishing
associations, said the regulations were overly broad and unconstitutional
and poorly targeted.

The White House Thursday denied Republican charges that the announcement
was timed to steer attention away from a government report that drug abuse
among teen-agers has skyrocketed during his term.

Republicans also charged that Clinton was timing the announcement to gain
maximum publicity ahead of next week's Democratic National Convention.

<a name="3">Subject: Just a newbie(to a.s.p. and the internet, not to pipes)</a>

Dear Steve:
I am not sure if this is the address to give my intoduction to the pipe 
digest.  Nonetheless:
The digest is the best thing to happen to pipes since the invention of 
matches.  I have been smoking a pipe on and off (never really OFF,just 
allowing the time between bowls to get a bit long) since about 1976 and 
watching tobacconists disappear like buggy-whip makers.  I hope this 
trend is turning around. 
My older brother has always smoked a pipe and I remember the great smell 
his pipe smoking always left in a room. (Even though it was Middleton's 
Sugar Barrel).  When I joined the Navy, and everyone was smoking 
cigarettes, I defended myself by taking up the pipe.  OK - it was a 
Medico Brylon (haven't seen one of those in about 20 years) and i smoked 
sir walter raleigh special mixture.  I transferred to the Reserves and 
went to college, and was able to learn real pipe smoking at a shop that 
has long since closed, CB Foster's, in State College, Pa. I picked up 
great english seconds (Made in London England, or London Made, England on 
the stem) and tried all the custom blends, eventually settling down to 
mild aromatics and virginia blends.  I still have a beautiful Bari Opal 
and a Peterson's Donegal Rocky bent from those days, and all the seconds 
I bought. They all pretty much still smoke great.  My tobacco tastes have 
only slightly changed; the only aromatics I is Amphora in the Green 
Can/pouch.  I mainly prefer flaked virginias from McClellands or 
Dunhill's Light Virginia Flake. This is good because I am fortunate in 
being able to smoke all day at work, and I need tobaccos that I enjoy but 
don't bother other building tenants (we can't smoke cigars because people 
in other offices notice the aroma via the building's ventilation system, 
but no one has complained about pipe aroma, if they even notice it).  
My absolute favorite pipe is my Peterson Mark Twain.  
On the subject of the current anti-smoking climate, I have noticed 
occasional references in the PD to cigarettes.  While I do not smoke 
cigarettes, I would remind all pipe smokers that to the radical 
anti-smoking community, we are all just the same, and we should not look 
down our  noses at cigarette smokers just because they have not the 
supreme good taste and judgement to smoke a pipe.  Now, I have for 20 
years suffered under the unfairness of restaurants allowing cigarettes in 
the smoking section but not pipes or cigars.  Now cigarette smokers are 
suffering, in much of the country, what we suffered for years.  And at 
least I could usually go to a bar and smoke my pipe in the convivial 
company of others... Now even that is under attack in California and othe 
areas.  There are estimates that there are about 45 or so million 
cigarette smokers in the U.S.  If they get rolled over, pipe smokers 
don't have much of a chance, because what the radical antis want, and 
they are who are driving the issue, is nothing short of total prohibition 
of TOBACCO, not just cigarettes.  So, vote, be active, let your 
politicians know how you feel, and smoke in peace.  (Sorry if that came 
of as a tirade, but the issue is one I care about alot.) 

                                           Thanks, 
                                                 Steve Lehman

Hello Steve and all the Digest Readers!
While leaving for summer Holydays I would give one more little
contribute in the Knowledge of Tobacco World;reading the
literature both pipe tobacco related both cigars related,I noticed
a lack in informations that,in my opinion must be fixed as soon as
possible.I refer to our Toscano Cigar.Rick Hacker in his "The
Ultimate Cigar Book" never mentioned this Cigar concentrating his
focus on Cubans and similars.It seems that outside of Italy nobody
knows it!
This cigar has ancient roots since has been manifactured first in
the 18th century in Tuscany and is one of the product of Italian
craftmanship that survived and is still sold until our
times.Futhermore,the offering was expanded with new interesting
variations and by now there are maybe ten kind of Toscano
available.
It is a long and slim cigar that has been cured after the rolling
phase with a salmaster solution that gives it his particular
flavour.Usually we use to cut it in two pieces and smoke them
separately doubling ,thus,the pleasure of smoking them.
Until a few years ago,it had the futher quality to be cheap but
since it has become a fashion cigar between Top
Managers,Politicians etc ,it lost this cheapness following the
rules imposed by our State Monopoly.
Nevertheless connoisseurs still buy them remembering with a lot of
"sadness" the times when Toscanos were a real popular cigar.
They are manufactered also in Italian Switzerland (and they are
maybe better then Italians) and in USA too,since some Italian
emigrants in 1920s started a production in New York state.
This Cigar has a great influence in Pipe Smoking too,because
adding a little bit of this cigar to some English Mixtures you can
obtain a strong but delicious mixture for the relax of evening and
night puffes.I use,for instance,mix some Toscanos to a 200grms tin
of White Balkan Sobranie.
>From what I read on PD,in the USA is running a strong activity
from "the non smokers lobby";in Italy things are going better but
the Toscano Cigar is a preferential target because of its strong
and penetrating smell.
When I will come back from Holidays I will send the complete range
of the Cigars available in case of someone,visiting my
Country,would try this marvelous Cigar.

Hello Steve and fellow pipe smokers,

I wish to pass on a favorable comment about the work of Mark Tinsky, 
Pipe Maker and Repairman.  (I would like to use the term 
'Repairperson' in the light of more modern, non-sexist language, but 
I have heard of only one female who works on pipes, so my apologies 
go out to any females on the list who may be or may be aspiring to be 
crafters of pipes.)  This comment is based upon my viewing of some of 
his pipes about a year ago in Fairfax, Virginia at a Pipe Fair at the 
store of John B. Hayes, Tobacconist.  Also, Mark did some repair work 
for me.

I have one of Mark's pipes, of the "American" line.  It is a bent 
bulldog with a sandblasted finish.  It's a handsome, large-bowled 
pipe.  One day while admiring my collection of some 15 pipes, a 
dropped Mark's pipe on the tile floor of my studio.  The stem broke.  
I sent it to Mark for repair.  It came back in better shape, with a 
better fit than before.  I was really astonished at how good a job he 
did for a comparatively modest fee.

Mark has an information sheet with a breakdown of prices for the most 
specific kinds of tasks he performs.  I strongly recommend that any 
readers consult with Mark for any pipe repair or manufacture.

Mark Tinsky's email address is:  ???????????  All the information you 
need can be obtained through him at that address.

Wishing you all Contentment and Peace, 
John

Dear pipe smoker,

Hi. I am an anthropology student at Loyola University Chicago.  I am doing
research on the casts of dentition from an 19th century archaeological
population.  In several of the casts, the teeth exhibit a particular wear
pattern that appears to look like what is commonly known as "pipe
smoker's wear", a distinct hole that is created by the pipe being clenched
by the teeth for long periods of time.  In order to determine if what I have
found is indeed wear cause by pipe smoking, I am attempting to do an
informal survey to learn more about the general habits and
characteristics of pipe smokers.  If you are interested in helping me with
my research, please e-mail the answers to the questions in the
attachment to this address: ???????????????  Also, if you have any
comments or suggestions, or if you know anyone else that would be
interested in helping me with my research, I would greatly appreciate the
assistance.  Thank you very much for your time and contribution.

<a name="10">Subject: Enjoying the PD</a>

Dear Steve,

I have been recieving PD for several months now, and I wanted to let you know 
that I am really enjoying it.  I haven't been a regular contributor for a 
couple of reasons.  One, I am naturally kind of quiet.  Both a blessing and a 
curse!  Two, my job makes contributing, even finding time to log on, kind of 
difficult.  You see, I own a small trucking company, so small in fact, that I 
spend most of my time on the road, behind the wheel of a 1997 Freightliner 
Century Class truck.

My habit is to download the PD into a file, to be enjoyed at a later time.  
Most likely when I am stuck at some dock being loaded or unloaded for the 
better part of a day!  I believe I have one of the best jobs a pipe lover 
could have.  I have the pleasure of traveling this beautiful country, smoking 
a fine latakia in one of my 60 odd pipes.  My tastes lean towards Castello, 
Butera, Ser Jacopo and the like.  I have puffed from Blue Mountain (Cabbage, 
in trucker's parlance.  I have no idea why it is called such!) to the shores 
of Maine.                                

After 10 years of white-collar terror, where I was seldom allowed to smoke in 
the presence of another human, I have done this for the last 6 years.  I love 
it!  One of the few drawbacks is that I sometimes find it hard to log online.  
Fortunately, more and more truckstops are realizing that many professional 
drivers are equipped with laptops, and are providing phone access for us.  
More often than not, though, I must wait till my next trip home.  This can be 
anywhere from 2-3 weeks at a time.  Thus, one of the reasons for my quiet 
membership.

Anyway, I wanted to let you know I'm still out here.  Keep up the good work, 
and maybe I'll drop in on you sometime!  Got room for me and my ride?!

Till next time...
                                                       Sincerely,
                                                       Derek D Jones
P.S.  Feel free to publish any or all of this as you see fit/interesting.  
Maybe we'll find out together if any more drivers are enjoying the PD!

Hey Steve, what's up?
   Got the last issue of Pipes Digest and decided to add my two cents' worth
for the next issue. In the past week, I've been fortunate enough to have
smoked two ecellent cigars. The first one was a Calle Ocho which came in its
own cedar box. I took it to a wedding. The location was spectacular, with
beautiful views of the Ohio River; the ceremony and the reception were great,
and the Calle Ocho was perfect for the occasion. Very mild and pleasant. All
the groomsmen and the groom took a puff and they liked it too. Just a perfect
day all around. Beautiful wedding, perfect weather, great views, and a great
cigar. Life doesn't get much better!
   The next cigar I tried was the legendary Fuente Fuente Opus X. The
president of the Louisville Cigar Society brought back some boxes from a trip
to Florida, and he gave some to Oxmoor Smoke Shoppe to sell. I bought one of
the cigars, took one puff, and it was bliss. The Opus X is definitely every-
thing it's supposed to be. Very pleasant smoke and tasted wonderful. Without
a doubt, right near or at the top of my list. I wanted to bow to the president
of the society in reverence for bringing them back from Fla.
   Anyway, that's my story.
                                Smoke in peace,

Dear Steve-
I just noticed that you were a student at Penn, as was I (C'76 Gr'83).  
As it happens, Craig Tarler of Cornell and Diehl was too (C'52).  When 
were you there?  There was a pipe club in Philly about 15 years ago, 
which also met occasionally at the Classical Guitar Store.  Holt's was a 
sponsor (partially, at least, I think) back then, but now they are 
"Holt's Cigars" and no longer a tobacconist in their advertising.  
They've moved to upscale digs on Walnut Street, have a massive and 
opulent cigar section, a substantial fine writing instrument business, 
and by the way some pipe stuff (mostly very high end pipes).  It's sad 
to me.
However, best regards, and keep up the good work.

P.S. to previous e-mail...
You must but the largest sized straight Kirstens to get the full benefit 
of the design.  And they-re not kidding when they say to pack it as 
tightly as possible.  It makes a difference.  It smokes a bit 'sootier' 
to me, but it removes a huge amount of water (and a bit of the essential 
oils which shouldn't be removed).  For really full flavored tobacco, 
like Rattray's Black Mallory, it can't be beat.  It also helps discern 
some of the subtle differences in, for example, the McClelland Virginia 
blends, because the pipe carries none of the remains of previous smokes. 
 So much for my 2 cents.

Reply to Why Pipes Are Better Than Cigars.....

A cigar can definitely be enjoyable, with subtle aroma dn taste and
beauty. I smoked both pipes and cigars. And I enjoy both. I have not
become a professional at it, but it is a great pleasure for me. Pipes do
give a lighter aftertaste than cigars and have a great aroma. True, when
you've tasted one or more cigars, you've got a pretty good taste for
cigars. Pipes are more diverse, with copious blends to try. But they are
both good. YOU can definitely smoke a lot more for less. Sometimes I feel
like a cigar and other times I feel like a pipe. And it's more pleasant to
smoke.

I offer my condolences on the passing of your father. I recently lost my

Here is a list of some sources for estate pipes. These estate pipes sellers
make a real nice effort in providing photos or descriptions of the pipe
they have for sale via mail order customers. As long as you purchase a pipe
every six or so you'll stay on their mailing list.

I have only done business with Fine Olde Briar's. Rob is a very nice guy to
deal with. If you express an interest in a pipe, he'll hold it for you
until payment is received. He has a nice selection. BTW, Ron will be

still can offer a great deal of pleasure. And the prices can be GREAT!

Hello, Steve!

Due to a bug in my mailer program, I've only just now begun to be able to
read your digest.  I'm very happy to be aboard.  I can tell you THIS is one
club I never expected to find on the Net.
I was using a beta version of YAM on my Amiga and it was freezing whenever I
tried to read your mail (and fragmenting attached files,as well) but the
bugs seem to have been worked out and the program much improved in the
latest version.
Sorry for the technical digression - just wanted you to know why I haven't
been in touch.
I returned to pipe smoking after quitting cigarettes several years ago and
so far have no inclination to pick up the old nasties, again.
I inhale much less with a pipe and find the experience much more
contemplative, soothing and enjoyable.  I don't have difficulty going places
where smoking is verboten or sitting through a movie without getting up for
a smoke.
Looking forward to long association with other pipe-smokers!
Thanks!

[ Thank you, Richard! -S. ]

Steve,
 
I loved Mark Lathem's piece on Cigar vs. Pipe Smokers in the last
Digest--so much so that I would like to ask Mark's permission to reprint it
in the OPC Newsletter as space permits. Unfortunately, the address seems to
be that of a web page (which I don't know anything about) rather than an
e-mail address.  Can I ask Mark to get in touch with me about granting
permission for this and future efforts and for getting me proper e-mail and

<a name="20">Subject: Ohio Pipe Collectors Show Update</a>

Steve,
 
I'd like to give you and your readers one final update on the OPC swap/sell
pipe show in Columbus on Sept. 14.  Five weeks before the show, we have
rented 59 of the 61 available tables and are expecting a great show.  Lots
of big names will be there--Nikos Levin, Bob Hamlin, Craig Tarler--several
pipe makers, and just lots of other people with lots of pipes.  I talked to
Mel Feldman from Albany, NY the other day, and he informed me that he's
bringing 3,000 pipes.  I don't know what they will be, but it should be a
blast.
 
Our $1.00 raffle (not an auction!) will really be terrific.  I won't
attempt to list all the donated pipes, tobacco and other items, but the
responses to my requests for donations have just been terrific.  The high
point will remain the superb Dunhill donated by Barclay Pipe & Tobacco with
the fitted sterling silver case made by Chris Hill, wife of OPC member Pat
Hill.
 
I repeat my invitation for all who can possibly make it to attend.
Admission is free, and the Friday night gathering in the bar will be a
great opportunity for making new and renewing old pipe smoking friendships.
Plus, the Chicago contingent will be present, which means lots of pipe
viewing, buying, trading and whatall in their rooms.  The show runs 9-5 in
the Holiday Inn at 328 W. Lane Ave., right across from Ohio State.  The Inn
is about two miles east on the Lane Ave. exit off the 315 highway,
accessible off 270.  Call 614-294-4848 if you need a room at the special
show rate.  Contact me if you need more information.  To repeat, we're
expecting a big crowd and a great
show.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Steve, I just wanted to let everyone know that the OPC board has voted
unanimously to cancel the advertised smoking contest at our Sept. 14 show.
 Having rented all 61 available tables, we continue to receive enquiries. 
We decided that the contest was not that big a deal and that it was
important to free up three more tables for dealers.  We have now rented 62
tables out of a full house of 64.  I hope know one was planning to come to
the show just for the smoking contest, but, if so, accept our

and purchased it for the unbelievable price of $24.00 plus tax...of course.
It is a rather large pipe, aprox. a group 5. It is a prince briar. On one
side of the shank it says Dunhill and under that it says London. The opposite
side says FET f/t, under that it says,Made in England with an 8
underlined(for the year made). Under that is the pat no. 417574/34. Does any
of this help ? If anyone can help it would be appreciated. After all the
antique shops I've hit over the years this is the second time I struck gold.
The first find was a 1940 Dunhill Rollalite Lighter for $25.00 in Austin,
Texas...I'm always looking for that next pipe. Thanks John Munoz...

Hello!  Hello,  Steve!

	I offer sincere condolence for the loss of your Dad.

	Chuck Basso's notes on meerschaum in PD#221 reminded me that my 2 
lovely Calabash pipes need replacement bowls from time to time.  
Although they cannot be transported as discretely as their briar 
cousins, I carry and smoke these pipes at liberty to complement my mood 
and attire.  From time to time I have been as shattered as their clay 
bowls when one pipe or the other was crushed or dropped during my 
workaday activities.  A trip to the tobacco shop, a six to eight week 
turn-around time, and a small fortune later, I have replaced the bowls.

	I do not begrudge the bowlsmithy his due, and yet money (or scarcity 
thereof) is a great motivator.   I have a steady hand and I have an eye 
for precision and grace.  I humbly believe that I could fashion a 
handsome, serviceable replacement bowl if only I had the clay.  From 
whence comes meerschaum?  How can I obtain some?

   Hello all and hope your pipe dreams have been pleasant. It's been 
awhile since my last submission but after this past weekend I just 
had to let the group in on my latest find: Ye Olde Pipe Shop, 
Hamilton Hills Shopping Center, Jackson, TN. 38305. Floyd is the 
owner's name and this is definitely not a mall tobacco shop, the shop 
carries many fine tobaccos and pipes such as Nording, GBD, Comoy and 
Peterson to name a few. The conversation is friendly and he also 
carries a good line of cigars for all of you aficianados. For anyone 
who might be passing through TN on I-40 exit 80A it's well worth a 
look see.                                                             
      I spent this past weekend in peaceful pipe bliss by carrying 
the wife and children to a middle Tennesee Trout stream and fishing 
to my heart's content. The fly line wasn't always cooperative;as 
usual; but the fishing was good and several trout were caught. Of 
course pipe in mouth and a fine
leaf to smoke contributed greatly to my experience, especially 
at night sitting out under the stars smoking my new Nording freehand 
with a bowlful of #3 purchased at Ye Olde Pipe Shop. It's really 
amazing how peaceful a freshwater stream and a bowl of tobac can make 
a person feel. I took some good advice offered in digest #221 and 
smoked only my less
expensive pipes while in the stream ( to avoid that dreaded slip of 
the foot and then floundering around and losing one of my prize 
pipes) but nighttime offered me the opportunity to sit back with pipe 
in hand, counting stars, and reliving the day's
events. 
     Well enough rambling, just some enjoyable thoughts on pipes and 
fishing. I really enjoy the digest and look forward to them regularly.
 Steve, you have might utmost gratitude for a job well done.

Pleasant Smoking,

Connecting the Dots:
A Concise History of the Sasieni Pipe
by
Stephen P. Smith

In his excellent book, "The Ultimate Pipe Book", Richard Carleton
Hacker writes American pipe collectors "seem to be more preoccupied
with 'smokable' brand names, of which the most collectible are
Dunhill, Barling, Sasieni, and Charatan." Theodore Justin Gage, the
former publisher of the much missed "The Compleat Smoker", called
Sasieni pipes a "fascinating collectible, ...representing all that is
good about classic English pipe making."  And for good reason: the
pipes made by the Sasieni company between the years 1919 and 1979 rank
among the very best the London pipe industry had to offer.  They
featured superb wood, flawless bowls, outstanding smoking qualities,
and a styling that was uniquely theirs.

Yet for all that, Sasieni's are among the most underrated pipes on the
collectible market, usually selling for far below their real worth.
In this, they offer the astute collector a genuine opportunity,
whether he or she is looking for a pipe with potential for
appreciation, or simply a great pipe at a reasonable price.

However, in order for the collector to capitalize on this, it is
vitally important to realize the Sasieni company changed hands on two
occasions, and each owner had different priorities and agendas.  Not
surprisingly, this was reflected in the quality of the pipes made
during these different times.  All bore the Sasieni name, and yet they
were very different pipes.

It is possible to divide the Sasieni history into three eras, similar
to Barling.  In fact, throughout this article, I will be referring to
"Pre-Transition, Transition, and Post-Transition" Sasieni's.  While
this may raise a few eyebrows, I believe it will become clear these
classifications are actually quite appropriate.

Therefore, it will also become clear a collector must be able to
distinguish between Sasieni's of different eras, as it is mainly the
family made pieces made between 1919 and 1979 which are truly
desirable to collectors.  The dual purposes of this article, then, are
to trace the history of the Sasieni pipe, and to enable collectors to
judge, with a reasonable degree of certainty, when the Sasieni in
question was made.

I
A Brief History of the Sasieni Company

There is a great deal of mystery surrounding the Sasieni pipe, owing
largely to the fact there is such a paucity of written information
about them, as is the case with many collectible pipes.  Even the name
of the founder is subject to debate.  One respected source says the
founder was named "Joel" Sasieni.  Another equally respected source
says with equal certainty the name was "Joseph" Sasieni.  (A third,
rather less reliable source once told me "Joel" and "Joseph" were
brothers, but I think we can safely dismiss that.)  An old Sasieni
catalog which I came maddeningly identifies the founder as
"J. Sasieni".

Whatever his first name was, Mr. Sasieni apprenticed at Charatan, and
moved on to Dunhill, where he eventually rose the position of factory
manager.  Many men would have been perfectly satisfied with such a
position, but not Mr. Sasieni.  He opened up his own factory in 1919,
believing he could improve on some of Dunhill's methods. Mr. Sasieni
was, if nothing else, an optimist.

Things did not go smoothly for the new firm.  The factory burned down
almost immediately.  Apparently undaunted, Mr. Sasieni simply rebuilt
the factory and carried on.

One change he incorporated in his pipes was the method of curing the
bowls.  While the briar blocks were air cured, similar to Barling,
Sasieni took this process a step further by "oven curing" his pipes.
Each pipe was cured in an oven over a period of six weeks, being
removed periodically by a factory worker, who would wipe away the
moisture as it emerged from the bowl with a rag, and check it for
cracks.  The end result was Sasieni pipes (the ones that survived)
were extremely dry smoking.

Sasieni was not oblivious to the success Dunhill had achieved with its
famous "White Spot" logo, and while he obviously couldn't copy the
logo exactly, he apparently saw no problem with reinterpreting it a
bit.  Therefore, each Sasieni pipe which came out of the factory had a
single blue dot in the stem.

Not surprisingly, the idea of their former employee competing with
them using a very similar trademark didn't exactly make Dunhill's day.
They threatened legal action in both the U. K. and the U. S..  Sasieni
was saved in England by that country's rather vague trademark laws,
and the Sasieni One Dot continued to be produced for the European
market for several decades.

Sasieni was not so fortunate in the U. S., where by the early 1920's
Sasieni had found an enthusiastic audience.  In an initial attempt to
comply with U. S. patent law, Sasieni moved the one blue dot to the
side of the pipe.  This unfortunately didn't do the trick, and only a
few side dot Sasieni's were ever made, which are now extremely rare
and collectible.

So, thanks in part to Dunhill's patent attorneys, one of the most
famous logos in the pipe industry was born.  To clearly differentiate
his pipes from Dunhill's, and also to distinguish the American market
pipes from all others (American market pipes originally only had a
three month guarantee, although by the mid 1930's this was extended to
one year) Sasieni put four blue dots on the stem of his pipes,
arranged in the shape of an elongated diamond.

The distinctive logo was an immediate hit in the U. S., where it,
along with the pipes' exceptional smoking qualities, helped the pipe
to sell in such quantities the factory had trouble keeping up with the
demand.  In fact, by the 1930's over 90% of Sasieni's production was
going to American shores.

Ah, but we Americans are a restless lot.  We just don't know when to
leave well enough alone.  So enamored had the U. S. market become of
the four blue dots, the importer wanted to make sure they could be
seen by everyone standing on each side of the smoker.  Therefore
Sasieni, reluctantly by some accounts, agreed to put four more dots on
the right side of the stem.

The Sasieni Eight Dot is now the most collectible of all Sasieni
pipes, due to both its scarcity and the fact that, unlike other
Sasieni's, the collector can be reasonably certain when the pipe was
made.  The Eight Dot made its debut in the late 1920's or very early
1930's, and was discontinued during W.W.II due to the inevitable
shortages of supplies.  Like the Four Dot, the Eight Dot had its logo
made by individually inserting rods of blue plastic into pre-drilled
holes in the stem, similar to the process used by Dunhill for their
one white spot.

This was an excruciatingly difficult procedure, even on the Four Dot,
for each dot had to be placed just right in order to create the
desired diamond shape, and on the Eight Dot, both sets had to be
symmetrical.  For all that, it is rare to find a an original Sasieni
bit in which the dots are even the slightest bit off.  This in itself
bears testimony to the fastidiousness with which Mr. Sasieni applied
his craft.  It also makes it fairly easy to spot a fake Sasieni stem.

Both the Eight Dot and the Four Dot were marketed in the U. S. during
the pre-war years, with the Eight Dot fetching more money, even though
both pipes used the same wood.

The post war years brought many changes at the Sasieni company, not
the least of which was the death of Mr. Sasieni himself, in 1946.  His
son Alfred (named, perhaps, for his father's arch-rival and former
boss?) proved a worthy successor to his fathers' business, and the
company continued to thrive under his leadership.  About this time the
company started stamping "Four Dot" on the shanks of the pipes, to
further capitalize on the now famous trademark's prestige.  There were
other changes in both the shank nomenclature and the dots themselves,
which will be reviewed in detail later on.

Through the post war years, Sasieni added shapes and lines.  While the
Four Dot remained their most famous product, the company also sold
lines of "seconds" under various names, such as Mayfair, Fantail, Olde
English, and Friar.  These were pipes made of good wood, but possessed
of some flaw, usually filled with putty.  Pipes that were almost, but
not quite, good enough to be a Four Dot were sold as Two Dots.  I have
two of these pipes in my collection.  Both pipes are quite striking,
exhibiting exquisite shapes and exceptional grain.  At first I
wondered why they were not Four Dots.  Eventually, after long
inspection, I discovered each pipe contained one very small filled
flaw.  In spite of this they remain two of my favorite pipes.
However, it is clear Sasieni was determined to put the Four Dot logo
on only the most perfect pipes.

Alfred Sasieni continued to run the company prosperously until 1979,
when he sold out to another firm.  Interestingly, he stayed on in the
capacity of a director.  At first it seems to have been a harmonious
partnership.  The new owners started their tenure with a limited
edition reissue Eight Dot.  This was a generous sized, natural stained
smooth pipe which occasionally also had a gold band.  Each pipe had a
blue string running through the bowl, shank, and stem, affixed with a
lead stamp and paper tab signed by Alfred Sasieni himself.  These
pipes are both strikingly handsome and maddeningly elusive, due to the
fact only 100 (or so, accounts differ) were ever made.

This spirit of cooperation between the old and new owners does not
appear to have lasted long.  Alfred Sasieni believed only vulcanite
should be used for pipe stems, eschewing the newer, trendier Lucite.
When the new owners, contrary to Alfred's wishes, issued a new Ten
Dot, replete with Lucite stem, it seems Alfred decided he had had
enough, and left the firm for good.

The new owners of what can accurately be called the "Transition" firm
continued to create high quality pipes using the old wood and methods
they inherited from the Alfred days.  However, these pipes are not as
collectible as the family pipes, and it is necessary for the collector
to be able to differentiate between the two.

The new owners do not appear to have retained their interest in pipe
making for very long, as they sold the company again in 1986.
Unfortunately, this new, "Post-Transition" firm decided to abandon the
high grade market place, and instead transformed the Sasieni into a
mid range "smoker", a metamorphosis from which it has yet to recover.
The news owners decided to capitalize on the Four Dot mystique by
eliminating all "second" lines, and issuing practically everything
under the Sasieni banner as a Four Dot.  This had the inevitable
effect of lowering the overall quality of the line.  For the first
time, it was possible to find a Four Dot with a putty fill, which
would have been unheard of when the family ran the company.  Even the
"Transition" firm maintained the integrity of the Four Dot line by
marketing flawed pipes under some other line.

Ironically, it is generally agreed the two most active markets in this
country today are the "high end" and "low end" markets, with the
middle $35-$100 range being the most sluggish--precisely where the new
Sasieni's are now being marketed.  Fortunately, fairly obvious changes
in the nomenclature--to say nothing of the presence of putty--make it
easy to spot a "Post-Transition" Sasieni.

II
Dating a Sasieni

No, this has nothing to do with asking the pipe to go out to the
movies with you.  As I have mentioned before, it is important to be
able to date a Sasieni which you are contemplating purchasing.
Pre-Transition Sasieni's, as I will now call them, are obviously the
most collectible and desirable, with the Transition pipes being
marginally collectible (although the commemorative Eight Dot, when you
can find one, is extremely collectible), and the Post-Transition
Sasieni's having little or no collector value at all.

Unlike Dunhill's, Sasieni's (and in fact most pipes) do not have an
explicit system for dating the pipe to the year.  However, by
understanding an admittedly somewhat arcane combination of
nomenclature, patent numbers, and dot arrangements, it is possible to
narrow your Sasieni's date of manufacture to within a certain era, and
sometime even down to a certain decade.

Ironically, the pre-W.W.II pipes are easier to date than the post war
pipes, because Joseph (or Joel) Sasieni was always fiddling with the
details which help to date the pipe.  Son Alfred seems to have made
some initial changes in the nomenclature after taking over the company
in 1946, and been content to leave well enough alone.  Sasieni
nomenclature changed very little between 1950 and 1979, although the
company continued to develop new shapes and finishes.

To begin with, there are three main elements to dating the Sasieni
pipe, the patent number, the style of the name "Sasieni" as it appears
on the shank, and the Dots themselves.  Naturally, there are
exceptions to these rules (this hobby would be boring without them),
but for the most part these guidelines apply better than 95% of the
time.  All Sasieni One, Four, and Eight Dot pipes made before W.W.II
and destined for the U. S. market carried a patent number on the shank
which usually started with the numbers "15", with 150221/20 and
1513428 being representative of the group.  Also, the name "Sasieni"
was stamped on the shank in a very florid manner, with the tail of the
last "i" sweeping underneath the name forming a shape which has been
compared to a fish by more than one collector.  This script was
discontinued by Alfred almost immediately after he took over the
company, so this alone tells you your pipe is pre W.W.II.  Underneath
in block lettering are the words "London Made", with the patent number
making the third line.

The dots will help you narrow this down further.  As we mentioned, the
short lived U. S. market One Dot was introduced around 1920, and was
replaced by the early to mid 1920's by the Four Dot.  The 1920's Four
Dot is distinguishable by the florid Sasieni script, a patent number,
and four blue dots, which are quite small compared to the pipes of
post war years.  Furthermore, by 1935 Sasieni began stamping pipes,
based on the shape, with their own names, which were usually, but not
always, English towns.  For example, apples were stamped "Hurlingham",
bulldogs were "Grosvenor" or "Danzey", and panels were "Lincoln".  One
rare and interesting variation of this was the large bent, dubbed
"Viscount Lascelles".  Even in this soft Sasieni market, these pipes
regularly sell for $150 in their rare appearances in mailers.

As mentioned above, the Eight Dot appeared in the late 1920's or early
1930's. These too have the florid script and the patent number, and
the presence or absence of a town name will help you date this pipe
fairly precisely.  Although the Eight Dot remained in the catalogue
through the war, it was for all intents and purposes discontinued
during W.W.II.

Once Alfred took over the company in 1946, these elements changed in
fairly rapid succession.  The first thing to be changed was the
nomenclature itself.  In place of the elaborate "Sasieni" stamp of pre
war pipes, a simpler, though still script style, "Sasieni" was used.
This can be seen on patent pipes which have the small, old style dots.

Soon after, Sasieni enlarged the dots themselves, and they formed an
equilateral rather than an elongated diamond.  My pet theory on this
is the dots were enlarged to make up for the fact there were no longer
eight of them, but I can't prove it.  Finally the patent number was
discontinued, and the words "Four Dot" were added.  The shank thus
read:

Sasieni
Four Dot
London Made.

Somewhat later still, this was modified to reflect the finish,
e.g. Four Dot Walnut, or Four Dot Natural.  All these changes seem to
have been made in the years between 1946 and 1950.  Therefore a pipe
with new style dots and old style stamping almost certainly has a
replacement stem.

This system changed little if at all in the ensuing thirty years.
When the company was sold in 1979, one of the first things the new
owners did was to eliminate the town names from the shanks.  The dots
were enlarged yet further, and the Sasieni name, though still done in
script, was larger, as was the rest of the shank nomenclature, which
in all other ways was similar to the Pre-Transition nomenclature.
While these pipes are not as collectible as the family made pipes,
they were made with care and are high quality. 

The nomenclature changed again in 1986, with the sale of the company
to the Post-Transition firm.  The three line nomenclature was changed
to two lines, with the first reading "Sasieni 4 Dot" and the second
identifying the finish, e.g. Natural, Walnut, or Ruff Root.  Note how
4 Dot is spelled, using an Arabic numeral 4, as opposed to spelling
out the word "four".  This is the easiest way to spot a
Post-Transition Sasieni, as the new company has used both script and
block lettering to spell the word "Sasieni" on the shank. 

As mentioned above, there are exceptions to these guidelines, which
can be frustrating.  Probably the most feared aberration in our neatly
constructed Sasieni universe is the European One Dot.  As may be
remembered, Sasieni had no problem keeping his original trademark in
Europe in spite of Dunhill's best efforts to the contrary.  This led
to the pipe being manufactured for European markets until the sixties.
If in doubt, check the rest of the nomenclature.  Old style stamping
(just think of the fish) means an old pipe.   

The most difficult to distinguish from 1920's era U. S. One Dots are
the European One Dots made in the 30's and 40's.  Here you just have
to know your patent numbers and hope for the best, bearing in mind
virtually any pre war Sasieni is collectible.  In any event, these
pipes are rarely found in the U. S..   

A few other pipes, such as the plum finished pipes, kept their patent
number after the war.  Again, knowing your dots and script styles will
help keep you from mis-dating these pipes. 

III
Why Collect Sasieni's?

There are many reasons to collect these pipes, ranging from the purely
monetary to the aesthetic and esoteric.  While I personally do not
collect pipes to make money, nor do I advise same, the fact remains a
high grade, flawless, first quality pipe that currently sells for less
than $100, and often less than $50, surely must have some potential
for appreciation.  No less an authority than the late Barry Levin
himself once told me he felt Sasieni's were severely under valued, but
as time went by they would eventually take their rightful place next
to Dunhill and Barling, as people came to appreciate the wonderful
qualities of this pipe. 

There are many theories regarding the soft market for these pipes, the
most logical and most accepted of which points to the low price of the
currently made pipes.  Sellers are often reluctant to price a
pre-smoked pipe higher than an unsmoked one of the same brand, and
buyers reluctant to pay more..  It is important to remember, though,
there is a vast difference in quality between the Pre-Transition and
Post-Transition Sasieni's.  The older pipes should sell for more than
the new ones, simply because their quality is so much higher. 

Monetary considerations aside, there are many other reasons to collect
Sasieni's.  First, unlike many collectible pipes, the Sasieni is
actually quite datable, contrary to popular belief.  The ability to
date a Sasieni at least within a certain era, and sometimes within a
decade, not only deepens our appreciation of these pipes, it also
ensures we spend our money wisely. 

Furthermore, there is the company itself.  Sasieni was a family owned
company, run by people who took deep pride in their work.  The firm
has an interesting history, with links to two of England's other great
firms, Dunhill and Charatan, whose influence can occasionally be seen
in Sasieni pipes. 

Most importantly, there is the pipe itself.  Sometimes it almost seems
as though collectors forget the ultimate purpose of a pipe is to
deliver a great smoke.  Pre-Transition Sasieni's fulfilled this
purpose admirably, and continue to do so.  The old Sasieni's were
renowned for being extremely dry smoking, and even today a well cared
for Sasieni will deliver a cool, dry smoke, even though the pipe may
be over seventy years old.  While Pre-Transition Sasieni's are usually
available only on a pre-smoked basis, occasionally one can still be
found unsmoked by the fortunate collector. 

On top of all this, the pipe is truly pleasing to the eye.  The wood
is full grained, usually featuring striking cross cuts and astonishing
birds-eye, as well as the occasional straight grain.  The Four and
Eight Dot, as well as the early One Dot pipes always had clean bowls.
Any pipe with even a tiny fill was relegated to the "second" line. 

One virtue of Sasieni's which I rarely if ever see commented on
deserves mention here.  The Sasieni shape line, particularly prior to
the war, has an undeserved reputation for being limited and overly
conservative.  Yet by 1935 their catalogue listed no less than 50
different shapes!  As one acquires more of these pipes one will
continually be surprised at the many unusual shapes, which show,
perhaps, the influence of Charatan. Anyone who has ever seen the shape
knows as the Exeter, which can only be described as a sort of freehand
bull moose, will know what I mean. 

Besides the Exeter, I have in my own collection a 1920's One Dot
shaped like a clay pipe, complete with tilted bowl and a heel
underneath, and a 1970's era Two Dot, which can only be described as a
tilt bowl, diamond shank pear (Sasieni only used the descriptive town
names on the Four and Eight Dot series).  The Sasieni pipe is quite
literally full of surprises.  I have no doubt as I continue adding to
my own collection, I will discover yet more unusual shapes.

Sasieni was also a pioneer in the concept of "Ladies' Pipes".  Three
styles, the "Argyle", the "Montrose", and the "Dorset" were designed
specifically for ladies.  Unlike many so-called ladies' pipes, these
pipes did not mar the finish with colored lacquer, or have a bowl so
small the lady in question could only get a five minute smoke.
Instead, they had reasonably sized bowls, and long slender stems and
shanks.  The "Argyle" and "Montrose" were carved and smooth versions
of a Billiard, respectively, and the "Dorset" was a carved oval shaped
bowl.  Needless to say, these pipes could be enjoyed by anyone who
simply wanted a smaller, slimmer pipe, as the finishes were exactly
the same as the rest of the Sasieni line.

Finally, there are the dots.  This may sound a bit silly to the
non-Sasieni collector, but Sasieni collectors know exactly what I
mean.  Sasieni collectors have a fascination with the striking logo,
which is both distinctive yet tasteful.  Some would say it has an
almost mystical quality about it.  Over the years, the dots have
changed both in size and color (although many of the seeming color
"variations" are simply a result of aging.)  Over the years the dots
ranged in color from light blue to a vivid sky blue.  Many collectors
are as enthralled with the dot variations as with the pipe itself!

The delights of this pipe are almost endless.  They deliver a great
smoke, visual enjoyment, and maybe even the possibility of monetary
appreciation.  They deserve to take their place next to the other
great collectible pipes of England's recent past, and perhaps, with
more understanding on the part of collectors, they will.

IV
Some Acknowledgments

It is impossible to write an article such as this without a lot of
help from other people, and indeed, I received a great deal of help
from the pipe collecting community, from both the famous and the
obscure.  It never ceases to amaze me that I could call someone from
out of the blue, and, upon identifying myself as a fellow pipe
collector, have that person gladly, often enthusiastically, drop
whatever he was doing and talk to me about pipes for an hour or more.

An article like this is never truly finished.  Just when I think I've
got it all figured out, I'll talk to another collector, or read
another magazine article, or come across some bit of long hidden
information, and be forced to reconsider my ideas.  Should anyone have
anything to add to this article, I would enthusiastically welcome your
call.  My office number is (617) 878-1300.

Thanks first and foremost go to Theodore Justin Gage, former publisher
of "The Compleat Smoker", and Richard Carleton Hacker, author of "The
Ultimate Pipe Book".  Both men graciously allowed me to quote from
their published works, and gave generously of their time on three
separate occasions each, even though neither of them was expecting a
call from yours truly.  Richard Carleton Hacker literally allowed his
dinner to get cold one evening while he answered my many questions.

Thanks are due to Jim Cooke, the Vermont alchemist without whom there
would be far fewer estate pieces in our collections.  Jim answered
many questions concerning the inner workings of the Sasieni pipe,
describing in almost torturous detail the steps involved in creating
the Eight Dot stem.

Many estate pipe dealers also gave generously of their time.  Thanks
go to Nikos Levin, Steve Leaders, and Jack Ehrmantraut, for discussing
at length with me the current state of the Sasieni market.

Of course, there is the pipe collecting community itself, that legion
of relentless individuals who scour the dark places in search of
collectible briar.  Thanks to Red Coombes, who played a crucial role
in helping me verify the very existence of the seemingly apocryphal
Ten Dot Sasieni.  Thanks also to Mike Reschke, the well known Parker
collector who's also pretty smart when it comes to Sasieni's.  Mike
introduced me to Jim Copic, and what amazing conversations those were!
I felt like I had hit the mother load!  Jim enthusiastically collects
not only pipes but hard to find ephemera, and was an invaluable source
of information about all kinds of obscure facts, including details of
the Sasieni guarantee.

And finally, thanks to the members of the Massachusetts based Sherlock
Holmes Pipe Club, particularly our fearless leader, Col. Don Powers,
who encouraged me to write this article when I myself had grave doubts
about the project ("Aw shucks, Don!  I don't know nothin' about
writin' in no fancy magazine!"), and who if fact got me started on the
road to collecting Sasieni's in the first place.

Steve,

   Has anyone had this thought and does it hold any water. I have been 
searching for my perfect tobacco and have been trying many of the tin/can 
tobaccos because I figure that these would be more easily obtained and 
would be more consistent than the bulk tobacco. When I visit different 
shops they all have their own names for the blends that they are buying 
in bulk from a wholesaler, and I don't think I get the same blend from 
one to the next. Buying in bulk makes for a better price but are their 
any other reason to stay away from these than price. Like other 
ingredients that I should avoid? Some of the more costly tobaccos I have 
been trying are Dunhills, Mac Baren, McClelland, Three Nuns etc...  How 
are these different than the cheaper brands like Captain Black, Prince 
Albert, Sir Walter Raleigh, Amphora etc...? Do the drug store brands have 
harmful additives? I thought I read in a back issue of PD that some have 
glycol??

Thanks for all the hard work!!!!

[Most of the store brands do contain glycol and "casings"
(flavorants).  So do quite a few of the premium blends.  The glycol is
used as a moisturizing agent.

Off the top of my head, I think that the McClelland's "Personal
Reserve" series does not. And there are others.  It's midnight and
thinking is becoming difficult... :-) But see the next letter. -S.]

     Dear Steve,
     
     Thanks ever so much for the Pipes Digest via e:mail.  It is a treat 
     for me to be able to take a moment during my busy day at the office 
     and find the PD sitting in my mailbox.  Even though I can't smoke 
     while reading it in the office, I still take a little time to read, 
     peruse and enjoy.  Then of course I print it, take it home, and read 
     the rest of it while smoking in my own easy chair.
     
     I consider myself a "purist".  I only drink regular, black coffee.  I 
     rely only on my old outdoor antenna for TV reception.  I cut my lawn 
     with a human-powered, hand-reel mower.  I used to smoke cigarettes, 
     but found them disgusting, unhealthy and distasteful (well, I smoked 
     domestic brands - and this was in college).  But in time I learned to 
     aprreciate tobacco for what it is.  Consequently I soon gave up the 
     nails and picked up a pipe.  I tried a lot of different kinds before 
     settling on the one domestic brand that I've stuck with through thick 
     and thin:  Borkum Riff.  It's inexpensive, easy to get, and it tastes 
     and smells great.  I've also recently discovered two special tobaccos 
     I thought others might enjoy trying.  One is manufactured and packed 
     in Liverpool, England.  It's calle "GOLD BLOCK".  My sister brought me 
     a tin a few years back when she visited England with a friend.  It is 
     full-bodied, aromatic, but not too dark or strong.  Very delicious, 
     smooth and delightful.  The other one is called "TWIST".  This is 
     "spun" tobacco that comes in a very tightly packed cord.  What you do 
     is shave off a little from the end and rub it in the palm of your 
     hand.  It flakes out to become a nice little wad of fluffy, dark 
     tobacco that burns very cool and tastes like a fine cigar.  I know 
     that both of these tobaccos can be ordered from JR.
     
     Smoke in peace, my friend.

<a name="41">Subject: Re: Benjamins</a>

As promised, am reporting back.

I went in and searched out a few gems: a couple of GBD pipes were
snapped up immediately.  It seems that these pipes given to Benjamins
are very old stock: there were two HUGE cardboard crates full of boxes
of pipes.  Most, unfortunately, are what I suppose you'd call in
Yankese "drug-store" pipes of the <<highly>> desirable type with "real
briar" reassuringly stamped on the sides.  The second time I went in
they had not completely unpacked the second crate, as Benjamin had
departed overseas to a convention (lucky sod!).  I must say I was very
impressed with the staff: they were very helpful and before leaving
Benjamin himself let me rummage around in the first carton with what I
consider to be great latitude.  Perhaps he is not used to someone
relatively young purchasing pipes.  I also managed to score from his
regular stock an ebony Peterson 120.

Nevertheless, I am VERY pleased with the GBD's, especially when he let
me have them for only $AUD 9.95 each!  (That's about $US7.00!!!!)  I
am presently breaking in one of the two Pedigree pipes (#90891).  I
have never had a Peterson (my usual brand) that has smoked so well.
The smoke is cool and always stays well lit - one match and you're
away.  The other one I grabbed is a Pedigree #91311 SF.  The grain
patterns are beautiful.  The shanks have "HAND CUT" marked near the
join.

Now, for a few questions.... ( I hope you'll oblige by donning your
pipe expert fez when and if you reply!) Should I keep the extras
untouched for a time?  Are these pipes hard to get elsewhere?  Is
there anyone out there desperate for one of these? (perhaps it's a bit
selfish to hang onto both)

By the way, has anyone ever heard of tobaccos called "Skallorna" or
"Cutty Sark"?  I collect old advertisements (any contributions
welcome!) and have never seen these tobaccos for sale: perhaps they
were for the UK and USA domestic markets.

Any comments welcome, as is also any brochures etc from stockists.  If
anyone is visiting Australia, please do not hesitate to give me a call
(although I don't think the surplus supplies at Benjamins would
justify it.... after all, I have got in there first!!!!!)

Once again, THANKS for the great work you do.

Adamm

<a name="43">Subject: My Tinsky Pipe...</a>

In the last issue of PD, I wrote that I had asked Mark Tinsky
(??????????????) to make a special pipe for me.  The pipe arrived this
week, and I am extremely pleased.

The pipe is a straight, plateaux-topped billiard, 6" in length with a 
2 1/4" high bowl.  The chamber is about Dunhill group 5 size, and the
pipe has a slightly ovalled stem and a saddle bit.

The pipe is quite striking visually.  In describing my wishes, I told
Mark I wanted a pipe with a high "wow" factor, and he delivered exactly
that.  The pipe is a straight grain and was given a light finish to
accentuate this grain pattern.  The stemwork is outstanding (I'm pretty 
picky about my stems--only Jim Cooke and Alfred Dunhill had been able to
completely please me previously <g>), and the stem/shank mating is
flawless.  I hope to find the time to photograph the pipe and put a scan
on my web page in the coming months.

The phrase "work of art" has been diluted somewhat by overuse, but this
pipe is exactly that.  I strongly recommend that anyone who has ever had 
the urge to design a pipe commission Mark to do the work for them.  I
can guarantee that they will be pleased with Mark's superior
craftsmanship and remarkably reasonable pricing.  I'm already working 
on another design for Mark--my very own "Christmas Pipe," #1 of 1 <g>.

Steve,

I thank you for the updato my address.  I really enjoy reading The Digest 
and would hate to miss getting it.

I attended my first pipe club meeting last Wednesday.  It was a great time.  
The group proves that pipe smokers are among the most friendly people 
around.  The club's name is the Sherlock Holmes Pipe Club of Massachusetts.  
If you like I can send information about it and its doings to the Digest or 
maybe someone already is doing this and my info would be redundant.

<a name="45">Subject: Italian tobaccoes</a>

Hi Steve,
I was wandering if italian tobaccoes are known abroad. I've seen some cigars 
("Toscano" ) in airport dury free shops,but nothing else.
The pipe tobacco ("Trinciato") is quite different from the other classical
tobaccoes ( English, Danish, etc.). It is quite strong, rough, unaromatized,
mostly like a cigar than a pipe tobacco.
Some people like it, some other not. Personally I smoke "classical"
aromatized tobacco, but sometimes I find it wonderful to have a "rough" smoke.
The same for cigars, they are quite strong, very slow burning, etc.

[ Personal note deleted. -S. ]

I am very interested in hearing other people's opinion.

Let me know ...

Dear Steve,

I was getting ready to compose this message, when I spotted Wayne Baker's
message in the current PD, and it relates directly to my question.  I
recently bought my first Savinelli, and it came with those little balsa
wood filters.  Fortunately, my pipe had one already in place, or I might
have chucked the lot of them, not knowing what to do with them.  I don't
know exactly how your pipe is configured, Wayne, but my stem separates
from the bowl in the normal way (not a screw in or anything like that). 
The piece of balsa slides right into the stem, and rests at a point where
about 1/3 of it is sticking out.  I then just put the stem back into the
bowl and the filter is in place.

I wasn't sure whether I was going to like this or not, but after a few
bowlfuls, I found that the balsa really did absorb a lot of the moisture,
and made for a much drier smoke. 

Now, my question:  I bought my Savinelli from a mail order house, and
though I've searched the accessories section of their catalog, I can't
find replacement filters for my pipe listed.  Does anyone know from whom
they can be purchased?

Steve,

thanks for replying to my post in asc.  I spoke
with a local transamerica agent this am.  He said
that if you have used any nicotine in the last 2
years you are a smoker to transamerica.  So according
to them, even 1 cigar in the last 2 years will make 
you a smoker in their eyes and they'll charge double
the premium.

you might also note for the faq that he mentioned another
ins. co., I believe the life ins. co. of Virginia that 
has a tobacco user but non-smoker rate that is more
tolerant of cigar smokers.

hope this helps others out there.  seems like the ins.
companies are tightening things up.

take care and thanks again.
please forward this info to bob for the faq update.

Hello everyone! It's great to be back after a year's absence.I've really
missed PD.

In my latest order from C&D, Craig included a sample of a new blend that
came with a story. It turns out that one day he was making up a batch of
#414, Oriental Silk. Being rushed, he accidentally used Latakia in place of
bright flake. After several self-imprecations about wasting five pounds of
tobacco, Craig tried a bowlful and discovered he had stumbled into something
new, unusual and good.

He's right. I am not a big fan of oriental style blends.Too harsh and too
hot burning. This combination works for me. It retains the spiciness of an
oriental but it is subtle. The use of latakia gives it a milder taste
without turning it into a typical english blend. And it is smoooooth without
sacrificing flavor. I didn't like it as an early morning smoke but it went
very well after a light meal or with a cup of tea. (Aged virginias or
heavier english blends are still my standard after a big meal.) It adds a
nice variation to my repetoire of tobaccos. 

If you are interested, Craig has given this blend the number 416. It doesn't
have a name yet. Perhaps he should call it
"Oriental-Blend-For-People-Who-Don't-Like-Oriental-Blends."

As usual, I have no connection with C&D except that of a satisfied customer.

Happy Puffing!

Dear Steve,     

Thanks for the great job you do in publishing the Pipes Digest.

Congradulations on your up-coming one year anniversary.  I have just 
celebrated mine.  Even though I have only been married a little over a 
year, my wife and I have a new two month old son.  He was born two 
months early.  Things have really changed.  

I have read several of the past P.D.s.  They are great.  I have been 
lurking for several months because I don't have my own computer and have 
to use a friend's.  He has just recently subscribed to P.D. himself.  

I have a couple of questions that I would like other readers to anwser. 
 I have just purchased a calabash.  The meerschaum bowl fits in the 
gourd body very tightly and is difficult to get out.  Is this normal?  
Should I put something on the cork or what?  Does anyone have copies of 
Pipe Friendly Numbers 1 & 3 that they would be willing to sale?  Answers 
may be sent to ?????????????? .

Using the Internet is new to me and I hope I have done this correctly.

Smokingly,
Earl Jacob Starbuck, Sr.

Quote of the Week:

"Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is
a species of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds
of reason in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by
legislation, and makes a crime out of things that are not crimes."

[ADMIN] In this issue, in response to popular demand, I'm going to try
to group the mostly-cigar-oriented articles together.

[ LEGISLATIVE UPDATE ] Following the last issue, I learned that the
FDA currently does not plan to restrict mail-order tobacco sales.
This was noted in their web page
(<a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/campaigns/tobacco/execrule.html)">http://www.fda.gov/opacom/campaigns/tobacco/execrule.html)</a> after the
last Digest went out. See my article later titled, "FDA executive
ruling" for the full text.

But lest anyone think we're out of the woods yet, I heard an FDA
official say that they planned to "go slow at first" with the
regulations. So stay tuned...

Steve:

This is a pleasure to see that sombody has the guts to make a web sight
like yours.  In todays society, to many liberal thinking individuals are
trying to take away all freedoms of self-expression and pleasure.  Please
note that I am not approving of selfish on the part of others, but that I
am stating we as Americans have developed this great nation under the
principal of individuality.  We must not forget that we all are Americans
because we or are forgoers choose to be!  WE left of countries to come to a
greater nation to stave of prejiduice of different beliefs!!  We as pipe
smokers, cigar smokers and every other type of tobacco user, must stick
together to let every other American know that we have "OUR" rights as
well.

I have been in the Medical community for many years, and as of date, I have
not seen one medical finding that relates second hand smoke to conclusively
cause greater chances of lung cancer.  Yes, this may be my opinion, but we
as Americans are entitled to an opinion.  Many of the people that I work
with have this conclusion as well.  There are many other things out there
killing people.  Yes, many have not been proven as well, but is that any
reason to target tobacco usage?  

Please keep up the grat wook, and please put me on your mailing list for
pipe digest.    My e-mail address follows.

Thank you in advance, and keep up the fight

I'm glad someone did this for Tom.  I've sent out a few individual hard
copies (including one to Tom), and several electronic copies of the complete
PD archive to folks who have requested them.  Perhaps Steve B. would like to
print and bind a few paper copies for those of us who would like to peruse
the Digest in our recliners <G>.

For those who are interested, issues #1-222 of Pipes Digest total nearly 1
million words.  I think we all owe the honorable Mr. Masticola a heartfelt
thanks for his labor of love.

On a different note, does anyone know of a source for the "old" Swan Vestas?
My supply is getting rather low, and panic is beginning to set in...

Hello again. I just was wondering if anyone could tell me if there were
any goo tobacco shops in Frostburg, Maryland and Salisbury, Maryland.

I love reading Pipes digest...... I have just recently smoking pipes and
it is an enjoyable experience. I have smoked a Danish Cavendish blend...
the aroma is great!

       What bothers me the most about the new tobacco legislation is that 
     the government is trying to project the image that it actually cares 
     about the health of its citizens.  For example the automobile 
     emissions laws in my state (Connecticut) don't apply to diesel 
     engines.  And older cars are exempt as well.  In other words, only 
     new, clean burning cars are subject to emissions regulations!  Driving 
     through town on a crowded summer day means inhaling massive amounts of 
     diesel fumes, burnt oil and gasoline, then suffering headaches and 
     nausea.  I can smoke a calabash full of tobacco with no ill effects, 
     so why is tobacco being targeted first?
       If the government really cared about the health of its citizens they 
     would target health risks that people are exposed to against their 
     will, not the ones that they choose to be exposed to.  I choose to 
     smoke, but I do not wish to inhale diesel fumes, pesticides, and other 
     toxic chemicals in the environment, as I get no pleasure from it.
       Government safety regulations are more about votes and dollars than 
     protecting health!

Dear Steve,

Let me add my appreciation of your work on PD to the many others already
published.  As a pipe smoker (started at age 15, stopped for a while in my
mid-20's, now at 43 an everyday enthusiast), small-time pipe collector and
lover of fine tobacco, PD is always a pleasure to read and sometimes source
of just the information I am seeking.

I am also an appreciator and small-time collector of acoustic guitars,
specifically small-bodied Gibsons.  I am more a looker than a regular buyer,
so I subscribe to monthly listings, like mini-catalogs, from a few of the
vintage guitar dealers.  Even if I don't buy a guitar every month, I am
delighted to pay the $12.00 or $15.00 a year to get the mailings every month,
increase my knowledge of the market and enjoy!

You probably can guess what I'm getting at!  I might buy an estate pipe once
in a while, but I would be happy to pay a fee to receive mailings from the
various mail-order dealers every month.  The vintage music dealers do it as a
straight subscription - no refunds if you buy something - no problem if you
don't.  Wouldn't this be a good way for estate pipe dealers to offset some of
their mailing/productions costs while giving folks like me the opportunity to
buy a pipe once in a while while enjoying and appreciating their mailings
every month?  What do you think?

Best regards, Jerry Posner, West Stockbridge, MA
????????????????

[ I don't know, but as long as the estate pipe dealers send around
photos for free, I doubt that such a system will go into place anytime
soon. And I'm sure that they'd be glad to keep you on their mailing
lists if you drop them a line, even if you don't buy anything for a
while. -S. ]

[ Apologies for assasinating the punctuation, Antti! If the =E4 and

Hi Steve and all pipe smoking friends in the Net!

Here comes the promised account of my hiking trip in Lapland in July -
August -96. This time I had at home taped everywhere little pieces of paper
reminding me to take the needed pound of tobacco (C & D's #414) with me in
the backpack. This I had learned from the unhappy hike I formerly did
without the main storage of tobacco (I wrote about this in PD a couple of
years ago under the title "A Pipe Smoker's Agony in the Wilderness")

I flew 2.5 hours with an ATR-72 turboprop from Helsinki to Enonteki,
Lapland. The plane did an intermediate landing in Kittil, a couple of
hundred kms south from Enonteki.

After enjoying a social evening with local friends in the hotel bar
with lots of beer and booze and talk about how was the winter for
reindeer, etc.  I drove in a taxi who distributed mail to every house
up to the Norwegian border and customs some 60 kms to the little Sami
village Nkkl situating about 10 miles east from the main road and 15
miles south of the Norwegian border. I gave this taxidriver friend 50
FIM (about 10 USD), lifted up my backpack and started my hike.

I climbed up a little fell and wandered to a small lake (they are called
"lompolo" in the north), made my camp, cooked some coffee, eat some air
dried reindeer meat and puffed enjoyingly a couple of bowlfulls of C & D's
#414 in one of the six Savinellis I carried with me in the backpack. Then
later in the evening I took four nice whitefish out of the lompolo with an
artificial fly, fried three of them and laid one in a little salt to have it
to-morrow rawsalted ("graavi").

This way I spent a week, every day moving some 5 to 10 miles, fishing,
drinking lots of black coffee, eating mysli and fish and puffing pipe until
the accident occurred.

I was coming down from a fell and was in the midst of damp small birch
growing area with uneven soil with hummocks and holes everywhere. Usually I
don't walk while looking around the way to go but this time I was careless
and stepped on the edge of one of those holes twisting the ankle and at the
same time falling in the hole. Moments of terrific pain. My backpack's irons
had hit my head adding the agony.

After some time I dared to move and noticed I could stand on my feet
somewhat. Made a staff from a birch and started slowly my way to the river.
It took several hours before I could put my feet in cold water and wade
cross the river. I had still go down the river to get a a proper camping
place. Could rig up my tent, fetch troublesomely some water, get the boot
somehow of my feet and lay down in the tent a make some coffee and light my
pipe.

I knew some day somebody will come, because this river luckily happens to be
about the only probable place to see some people here. It was only a
question when!

Well, it took almost four days this time. During those days it was
almost impossible to move at all. I took some photos during that time
of my ankle's changing colours and condition.  I had three pills of
pain-killers, but didn't use any of them waiting the aching get worse
and wanting to see my condition.

I invented a handy way to pee, did it into a sealable plastic bag of 4
liters. This way I was freed from the difficult crawling from and back into
the tent. There was a myriad of every possible type of mosquitoes and every
time one crawls back to tent there comes a million of them in clothes and
through the open zipper. Now I had to crawl out from the tent practically
just for fetching water from the river.

Then suddenly a voice was heard outside the tent uttering in Finnish "Terve"
(Hi!). Seldomly has the voice of a human being sounded that nice to me!
There was two Finnish students on their hiking and fishing trip having come
to their planned utmost camping place.

The guys stayed two days fly-fishing before they hiked back to the nearest
village. Their getting there took two days and the in the third came the
rescue crew from the fire-station of Enonteki. At first they drove me an
hour in a little boat with a small outboard motor, then some five hours
laying on my back in a sledge with long runners of at least 15 ft under it,
pulled by a six wheeled terrain vehicle (in Finnish "mnkij"). After
getting to a proper road then in ambulance to hospital some 80 miles south,
x-rays and foot taped and then by taxi back to Enonteki. A week in the
hotel waiting for my scheduled flight south. Much beer, #414 and chat with
the local reindeer men again.

As I left I had 20 lbs of deepfrozen reindeer meat and 5 lbs trout donated
by the local people to carry with me in a huge brown carboard box.
My ankle is still tightly taped in a bandage. It is a lot better now, only
going up and down the stairs is a little difficult. It doesn't hurt so much
any more :)

This time I had enough tobacco with me. To lay a week listening one's
leg aching in a tent with no tobacco to fill the pipe with would
indeed have meant a perfect hell on earth for me.  As I came home
there already was a shipment of Cornell & Diehl's #416 already
waiting.  BTW, Craig wrote that the name of this blend is "Plantation
Evening". So this new mixture was not named as an "Oriental blend for
those who do not like oriental blends". I must agree with the opinion
in the preceding PD, this new blend with 20% Latakia, 20% Perique, 30%
Turkish and 30% VA ribbon is really a winner and killer. Try it!

Dry ashes!
-Antti (?????????????)

[Sorry to hear about your accident, Antti.  Reminds me of the time I
hiked about 40 km with a bum knee... or the time I walked on a broken
leg for a week while thinking it was just sprained...

Dear Steve,
	
	Like many pipe smokers, I am always searching for good 
tobacconists when I travel. In the spirit of this ongoing ritual, I 
would like to tell you about my latest find. I was recently in New 
Orleans on business. I spent some of my free time exploring the French 
Quarter, a wonderful, exciting place. I was looking for the well known 
resturant, Antoines on St Louis St when I came across a small cigar 
shop called The Epitome. I found a nice sellection of cigars, and more 
importantly, a selection of pipe tobacco mixed only in this store. For 
any one interested, The Epitome is on St Louis St just off Bourbon St. 
It is worth the journey.

Hi, Steve
In issue 222, Felice Mocci lamented the lack of publicity about Tuscano 
Cigars in the United States.  In fact, there are several brands of these 
readily available in the States. They are called Tuscani or Italian 
style, and are generally put in the same catagory as dry-cured cigars.  
They are sold in many large variety and drug stores, and JR sells the 
following brands mail-order: Pedroni, Parodi, Avanti, and DeNobili. Some 
people think they are an acquired taste, but I enjoy them.  By the way, I 
believe that the Parodi and Avanti cigars are made in the U.S., while the 
Pedroni are Swiss.

Sammar,

Mold is hard to mistake on cigars in a humidor.  Just like on food, 
the mold takes on the appearance of green, fuzzy spots.  There is a 
special solution you put in your credo which prevents mold which you can 
get at any cigar shop.  The name escapes me at the moment, but it is 
by a company based in Atlanta.  

Also, the specks may be just that, specks -- natural coloration in 
the wrapper of the cigar.

They are open 10am-8pm Monday - Saturday and 11am - 7pm Sunday.

They carry a wide range of Cubans & Dominican's to include Nat

<a name="14">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #222 -- August 25, 1996</a>

I have been smoking cigars for about 10 months. I started out with the
cheaper stuff and have matured into the 100% tobacco which is truly
enjoyable anytime. My favorites have been the H. Upmann demi-tasse
(although it can be extremely rough at times), Don Diego (the lonsdale is,
in my opinion, almost like incense -- a densy heavy smoke), the Montecruz
(great anytime), Las Cabrillas (which had a light aroma, very earthy),
Canaria D'Oro (which had a grassy, earthy aroma -- very soothing), The
Montecristo #2 (the best cigar tried, it is creamy and very heavy), Primo
Del Rey (a very light, grassy, woody aroma -- also very pleasing), and
Punch Royal Corona (had a slight bite at times, but still pleasing with a
slightly overpowering aroma).

Recently, in the last few months, I picked up an inexpensive pipe ($20, I
think) and have been lighting that up with Black Flake and Danish
Cavendish pipe tobaccos. The pipe is definitely a lot more pleasing and
more aromatic, and not as rought as some cigars. The only problem is
keeping it lit, which is probably a problem encountered by many new pipe
smokers. The guy at my local tobacco store showed me a lot about it, but
when it was finally time for me to light it, I could never keep it lit. My
question is, how should I pack it? And a wooden match is probably better
for pipe lighting, right? 

Usually, I light up the pipe on late night walks (away from my parents)
and enjoy it walking or outside the driveway when the wind is not blowing
too hard, so I can therefore enjoy the aroma. I enjoy reading the digest
and hope that it continues to grow and prosper, in the light that more
people will become interested in smoking fine tobacco every now and then.

Smoke in peace....

<a name="15">Subject: The Anti-Anti smoking posts...</a>

     Steve,
     
     The other day I was watching Court TV. I witnessed the most
     recent case in which a man succesfully sued a Tobacco Co.
     for damages done to him through smoking. All the while, I 
     was thinking to myself "This guy, and all other like him,
     who file these ridiculous lawsuits, always trying to make
     someone else bear responsibility for their actions, really
     piss me off."
     
     Then I went to Berkeley for Pizza at Blondie's on Telegraph Ave.
     In the restaurant they have a display of old print ads. for
     cigarettes. Some of them are for Camel, Lucky Strike and other
     brands. I marveled at how in one of the ads. the copy read
     "Lucky Strike! The brand 6 out of 7 doctors recommend as being
     smooth on your throat," and in another the ad. featured a singer
     and the copy touted the fact that she smoked such&such brand
     because the smoke was "smooth" and refreshing, that particular
     ad. also mentioned that her throat was insured for $25,000.
     
     Anyway, it all got me to thinking that this man who was suing
     the cigarette company was of age when these ads., and more like
     them, were current. No wonder he didn't think twice about 
     smoking cigarettes - everyone did! Even doctors smoked and they
     endorsed certain brands as well! And it made me think about
     the murmurs of documentation that many cigarette companies
     had known by then that not only was nicotine addictive, but
     that smoking was bad for you. If they knew all of this, and
     I am not saying that that they knew, only "what if?,"
     then they had damn well better be held responsible for the
     people harmed by using their products. Caveat Emptor stopped
     being a product liability precedent a long time ago and I 
     fear the day it becomes one again.
     
     Well, it brings me to my point. In all of the anti-anti-smoking
     legislation rumbling that goes on in this list I sometimes
     get the feeling that most of the readers somehow feel sorry
     for these cigarette company giants - as if the majority of 
     their problems aren't self-induced.
     
     Also, many of these companies, if they were shut down tomorrow
     in this country,  would still be selling billions of packs, 
     weekly, in other countries. I was recently in Costa Rica and 
     I watched the kids buying packs of Marlboro "Reds" for the
     equivalent of 50 cents a pack, Marlboro billboards were the
     most common type (after Coca Cola.)
     
     So, when I hear that legislation is coming that may ban the
     use of billboards advertising cigarettes near schools, I am 
     glad. When I hear that the advertising community is upset that
     they are losing the privilege of lying to this country's 
     children - I laugh. But I don't take any of it too seriously
     and neither should any of you. The truth is that money talks
     and bullshit walks in the U.S.A., and the speed with which
     each do their task doubles, at least, in an election year.
     
     I realize, all too well, that what we all fear is the day we
     are no longer allowed to buy and use cigars, pipe tobacco or
     some of the higher end cigarettes. This is a genuine fear and
     I don't mean to mock it. But, I would sacrifice my right to 
     smoke if it would keep my daughter or son from smoking
     cigarettes. Maybe some of you are not - but there has got to be
     a happy medium.
     
     Of course, mis-information and dis-information campaigns; the
     likes of wich every side involved in this debate resort to, 
     are harmful in the end. The line that gets crossed by the 
     majority when trying to govern a minority is never clean.
     
     Just my two cents, sorry if I ruffle any feathers but I have a 
     really hard time having any pity for the cigarette companies, 
     the advertising industry, our idiotic politicians and the people
     who support all of them.
     
     -Adam.
     
     P.S. If I did manage to piss you off, think about how it feels
     the next time you want to post your polticial views to a few
     thousand people... There is a reason why it isn't polite, or
     appropriate, to talk about certain things in "mixed" company.

Dear pipe friends;

I've been "lurking" in Pipes Digest for the past year or so, and wish to
thank Steve and all of you contributors for the many hours of pleasure
you've given me sharing your exploits. I'm 42, married, 2 kids, and have
been a pipe smoker off and on for 18 years.(16 pipes in collection, mostly
Canadians)

I also want  to verify the report issued by Jeffrey M. Poulin in the Digest
#222 concerning C&D #416. Craig sent a sample in my last order which I took
with me on a Canadian fishing trip two weeks ago. On the second day of
fishing, I filled a bowl with #416 for fun and found it to be truly
delightful (He calls it Plantation Evening). The mix proves to be a nice
change from my normal blend of C&D #813 Professor and it really went well
with a bottle of Labatts' ale. It's quite a chore to run the boat, smoke my
pipe, drink a cold one,  pull in an occasional fish, bait hooks, and
untangle lines. Sounds alot like the recent reports on fly fishing, but no,
I didn't drop my pipe in the water...

I've only recently become a customer of C&D's and I've got to say their
products and services are first rate. Many thanks Craig! It's really nice to
find a good mail order source for tobacco as all the good pipe shops in
central Iowa are gone now and we must contend with stores that sell pipes in
spite of their main lines of glass do-dads, clay figureheads, John Wayne
portraits, $100.00 cigar cutters, etc. I went to the Tinderbox at the mall a
while back, and would you believe they only had 1 bag of tapered pipe
cleaners on hand?

Who buys all that other stuff, anyway?

In case this could be interesting to the readers: A month
ago I saw a Danish tv-programme about pipe carving and it
turns out that Sixten is still at work - and now with his
granddaughter Nanna Ivarsson (BTW a good looking woman in
her early twenties.

Sixten can't see very well anymore but he was still doing
some of the "rougher" work and letting Nanna finish the
pipes. And of course she learned from him all the time so
we have an upcoming lady here! Her own designs were very
beautiful, up to Sixten's standards.
Unfortunately I didn't get the programme on video tape...

e. Mail Order Sales and Redemption of Coupons 

The proposed rule would have prohibited the use of mail-order sales
and mail-order redemption of coupons because there is no reliable way
to verify the consumer's age. At the time FDA issued the proposed
rule, the standard industry practice simply required the consumer to
provide a birth date or check a box to signify that he or she was of
legal age.

The agency received many comments on this provision. Opponents argued
that young people do not buy cigarettes through the mail because they
do not have checks or credit cards with which to pay for them. Many
adults stated that they prefer mail-order sales because the products
are unavailable in stores or are less expensive. Others said mail
order sales serve those in rural or isolated areas, and that the rule
would eliminate the principal or sole source of tobacco for those
adults.

After reviewing the comments, FDA decided to allow mail order sales of
tobacco products. There is little or no evidence to show that young
people use mail order sales to any significant degree.  However, the
agency is concerned that children and adolescents may turn to mail
order sales if access to tobacco products is denied in other
ways. Therefore, FDA will monitor mail order sales to ensure that they
do not provide young people with a mechanism for purchasing cigarettes
and smokeless tobacco.

Mail-order redemption of coupons for free cigarettes or discounted
cigarettes will not be permitted on the basis that the agency did
receive evidence that young people were able to obtain free samples in
this manner. Evidence from the attorney general of Massachusetts
showed that as part of an operation conducted by his office, 30 young
people mailed in coupons for free samples of smokeless
tobacco. Virtually all of them received their free samples in the
mail.29

Contrary to the concerns expressed by a number of adults, this
provision does not prevent adults from receiving coupons through the
mail as long as they redeem the coupons in person where a sales clerk
can verify the customer's age.

Hi Steve
Here s a little story I posted  to ASP. If you like it and cosider it
suitable for publication in your journal please feel free. It s entitled. "
Oil Curing Briar- A fairy tale( of sorts)

Back in the hey day of the 1920's Dunhill pipes  were begining to take off.
MAster Alfred was fit to be tied. It seemed he had only planned  production
for x number of pipes and he was selling them at the rate of 2x. What to
do?
You see they had run thru their air cured wood that had sat for 5 years.

Being a realist Mr. Dunhill decided to cut corners a bit. He instructed his
foreman to start cutting  into next years wood which had been let sitting 4
years. I don t think it will make all that much difference he thought.
Maybe this years great sales were a bit of a fluke and we ll order more
green wet wood and over the next 5 years we ll catch up .
Fortunately , or unfortunately for Mr. Dunhill, the next years of sales
were better and better and he had to keep cutting into his  air curing
times in order to meet demand.

And one day, his foreman came to him and said," Mr. Dunhill, all we have
left is wet wood!"

Any simpleton knows you cant sell pipes made of wet wood. This is wood that
has come from the briar cutters that has been boiled for 24 hours or so to
remove the sap  from the briar burls.

"What are we going to do Capt? The warp engines are about...." ( OOps wrong
story. I kind of imagine the foreman sounding like  a latter day Scotty
form Star Trek.)

So he says" MR. Dunhill, what are we going to do, we re all out of dry wood? "

Mr Dunhill thought a moment, as he was a very creative man, and said,"
we'll force it to dry quicker!"

The ever innovate Scotty, I mean foreman went back to the factory  and
tried many means of heat to dry the wood. Most with terrible results as
force dried woods tend to crack horribly. It wasn t working out so well
until one day MR D came to the factory and uttered these fatefull words. "
If we could only lubricate the wood so it wouldn t crack so horribly  our
problems would be solved."

The ever resourceful foreman took him literally and soaked the burls in hot
oil before heating them. This solved the problem as the briar hardly
cracked at all!

" What do you think they 'll smoke like, Mr. D", inquired the foreman?

"I think it will be ok", he said. " Just think anytime they come up with a
new strange meat, everyone thinks it tastes like chicken. I think our
problems are solved......."

<a name="22">Subject: Questions...</a>

	Hello Steve and all...
I recently bought an excellent pipe. It is made by BIG BEN.
First question:
This is the first pipe I've owned that has a pre-carbonized bowl.
All my other `regular' bowled pipes smoke fine in terms of how hot the
outside bowl temperature gets. The Big Ben gets so hot though, I can't
hold it. 
I burn the same tobac in this pipe as all the others and I'm not
a Hoover on the bit.
Comments ? Physics explanations ?

Second question:
Does anybody have any info on this excellent pipe or maker(s)/maufacture?

Last question:
Does anyone have info on a tobacco company called Planta Pipe Point ?
I think they are German. They make a wicked` Golden Irish Coffe Mixture'
and `Old French Cognac Mixture'.
On the inside of the tin it is written thus:

Golden Irish Coffee Mixture
Weich und aromatish. Er schmeckt wie er duftet: Nach reifem Tabak,
sehr fein nach Kaffee altem irischen Whisky.
2 weitere Geschmacksrichtungen

I bought the last couple tins at a shop, but they said they probably
won't be getting anymore. There is no address on it.
Get this...the top of the tins have indentations for you to rest your pipe
in. Simply amazing stuff this is !
Does the scope of this amazing digest reach someone who can help ?

That's all for now...

                                 -Thomas.

[Well, I've smoked some precarbonized pipes, and I don't think that
the precarbonization is the cause of the hot bowl.  Heat for me is
more often a function of how the pipe is packed and
puffed. Paradoxically, I sometimes notice that pipes get hot if they
aren't lit well enough! Other opinions?  -S. ]

The Danish Championship was held in Copenhagen in March 1996
with 355 participants. The tobacco was 3 grammes of Sweet Dublin
smoked in a Stanwell type Dublin sandblast.

Winner, men:   2:08:41 - Carlo Waaentz
Winner, women: 1:58:40 - Sussi Jensen
Winner, team:  4:57:55 - Sydsjaellands Pibelaug

The results were not up to the usual standard maybe because
the Stanwell has a conical bowl instead of a straight as
described in 'Piber & Tobak' nr. 72, May 1996.
This is only an unofficial summary from one of your readers.

I have two Savinellis, both of which I bought at one of their shops here in
Italy. Their (patented, I believe) so-called "balsa system" consists of a
set of pieces of balsa wood, shaped in triangular-based prisms, which are
meant to be pushed into the tenon which, if you happen to look closely, has
an exceptionally large aperture.

The balsa is supposed to absorb most of the gurgle and much of the tar; to
this purpose it is meant to be changed every two-three smokes. I have tried
both with and without the piece of balsa but I cannot say I see much
difference, except that the gurgle is indeed reduced by being absorbed by
the wood.

I have even tried to place a filter in another pipe, after drilling a wider
hole in the stem. It was a very cheap "basket" pipe (tobacconists and pipe
retailers here in Italy have a habit of selling slightly defective pipes -
usually those with a couple of fills - at a lower price, putting them in a
basket and pricing them usually about 20-25,000 Lit which is roughly US$
15.-). The gurgle did improve, so I believe you might only be concerned if
this Savinelli should suffer of this problem.

As always, enjoy the work and effort you put into your "passion". Thanks

I would like to send to you for inclusion into the Resource Guide the
name of a tobacco shop that I did not notice in the most recent edition.
Without further ado...

Carrousel Tobacco Shoppe
8001 Reading Road
Cincinnati, Ohio 45237
Phone: (513) 821-5350

Their card reads thusly: Tobacconists to the Queen City
						 Suppliers of Smoker's Needs
						 Tobacco Blenders

They carry a nice variety of pipes (new and estate) and a wide selection
of tobaccos. Like most good shops, you are welcome to come in and load
up a sample. They also sell a nice variey of cigars. But beware! Seating
in the shop can sometimes be something of a problem. It is quite popular
among the cigar smokers. All in all, a friendly shop.

I don't believe that they have a catalog but they will ship purchases. 

Keep up the good work and smoke 'em if you got 'em.

I would really like to get in touch with some younger pipe smoking

they let their parents know of their smoking habit.   (I am now at 
that uncomfortable point! - any tips will be most welcome!)

I still find it difficult to smoke with confidence in public - 
probably because of my age.   Can anyone help me on this?

<a name="28">Subject: General Info and Hello!</a>

        Hello everyone!
I'm new to the internet and recently found your mailgroup. I'm impressed and
delighted with what I've seen and read so far. Any information on pipes and
tobacco are of an interest to me. One might say I am obsessed with it. A
worthy obsession I think.
        
A little background history, perhaps, is in order. I am nearly thirty years
old and I have smoked a pipe for eleven of those years. I tried a cigarette
in high school and didn't understand the fascination. My maternal
grandfather however always smoked a pipe and we lived upstairs from him and
one of my earliest memories is the aroma of tobacco.

My preferences in tobacco have not progressed much in eleven years I'm
afraid to say. I started with the drugstore blends have tried smokeshop
blends and have found very few I could smoke regularly and enjoy. The two
blends that I smoke regularly are Edgeworth and Edwards Pipes and Tobacco's
blend Scottish Moor. Incidentally, Edgeworth is the same blend that my
aforementioned grandfather smoked. Perhaps that's why I like it. I arrived
at it's selection without any exact knowledge of my grandfathers preference.
Genetic maybe? I'm not adverse of course to trying something new.

My selection of pipes has more than made up for my single minded taste in
tobacco. I guess you could call me a collector of sorts. I collect any pipe
that catches my eye and taste. For me, each pipe I own has it's own story to
tell about what was going on in my life when I bought it, who it reminds me
of and so on. I have one pipe of my grandfathers the only one left that I
know of. It's a Willard if anyone's ever heard of that brand and it still
gives a good smoke.

My other reason for writing is that I just bought the oddest pipe I've ever
seen. A man at a flea market here in central Florida had an entire box of
these pipes that according to the literature I swiped from him dates it
about 1947. Has anyone ever heard of a MelloPure Pipe? The whole thing comes
apart bowl screws out and theres a metal screw like 'condenser' that removes
moisture. The whole pipe is metal with radiator like fins all around with a
briar bowl. My model is the "Silvery Sheen Sportster" however according to
the pamphlet they made a briar one as well. I smoked the one I bought (Two
Bucks, but it looks so damned odd. A Star Trek pipe if I ever saw one) and
it was okay. I'd appreciate it if anyone else has ever heard of one and can
tell me if they've smoked one.

I've rambled on long enough and I still have a few old Pipe Digests to read
so I'll light a bowl and enjoy. 

                                                                Regards,
                                                                David M. Bent

The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

<a name="29">Subject: AW: Pipes Digest #222 -- August 25, 1996</a>

Hi everybody!

I'd just like to say comment what Steve said about the new tobacco
laws being implemented in America these days.

We all know that smoking a pipe differs alot from smoking a
cigarette. Most cigarette smokers will probably agree to being called
"addicts" to the drug "nicotine". And we know that serious pipe
smokers generally do not like to be compared with people who smoke
cigarettes simply because there's alot behind the simple act of
lighting a pipe or lighting a cigarette. Pipe smokers do enjoy a fine
pipe filled with an extraordinary tobacco. I guess most of you
(including me) could easily distinguish at least a dozen different
sorts of tobaccos just by their smell or taste. And who cigarette
smoker could say that of himself ?

As I said, smoking a pipe is much more than just the simple act of
"lighting some tobacco" and blowing the smoke into the air. I am sure
you all will agree that smoking a pipe has much more style and
elegancy than smoking a cigarette, or, let's exaggerate a little:
giving in to the addiction by smoking forty cigarettes or even more
day.

Surely the new American laws will make mail-ordering a little more
difficult.  But, please remember that there are alot of teenagers or
even younger ones out there who do not feel like we do about
smoking. Teenager who can buy cigarettes at each and every shop around
the corner and smoke themselves to death over years without even
knowing about the risks must be protected! I am sure you all know
about the huge profits most tobacco companies are making by ruining
peoples health. This can't go on - especially not if anybody is making
money on the expense of somebody else health, especially those who are
too yound and too inexperienced to know.

I enjoy about one or two pipes a day. It is huge fun for me and has
always been a wonderful pastime. Prohibiting the sale of any tobacco
at all because it is a drug is nonsense. For example, nobody would
ever dare to prohibit the sale of alcohol! But we all have to do
something about the real problems that do exist.  I know about the
risks smoking poses to my health. I try to minimize them by not
smoking too much and by smoking with much "consciousness". But smoking
a pipe is also so much pleasure and fun for me, that I simply do not
want to give it up just because anybody is telling me it's "not
healthy". What way of having pleasure would then be healthy in this
world ? None!

And now enjoy your pipe with pleasure and stay safe!

Sincerely yours Bijan

[Well, Bijan, alcohol prohibition has been tried.  Although it was an
awful flop (as related in the Quote of the Week), it might not keep
the FDA from trying it again sometime. -S. ]

I have been lurking around the digest for quite awhile now, throwing
in the occasional comment and answering what reader questions I can
via e-mail.  Well, I had one of those weekends that needs to be
shared.

It started when a good friend from So. California came up to So. Lake
Tahoe for a week of vacation.  My family and I live in Reno, so we
drove down friday night, armed with a bottle of Amontillado and
several bottles of Chimay Grande Reserve ale.

My freind Helmut (another faithful "Digester") had a tin of Esoterica
Pembroke.  What a smoke!  So very rich and smooth.  I have a fabulous
Randy Wiley pipe, a "right hander" that I quite lovingly refer to as
the "Trashcan".  This is due to the massive bowl size.  Anyone who
does not have a Wiley should try and find one.  This pipe I have is a
real beauty.

We sat on the deck of helmut's cabin, overlooking Lake Tahoe, enjoying
the Chimay and Pembroke.  It was one of the best bowls of tobacco I
have had in quite some time.

On Tuesday of the following week, I had to fly to Los Angeles for a
business meeting.  My partner picked me up at the airport and we
headed for Schatze's in Santa Monica.  What a resturant!  We sat at
the bar and had their chicken pizza and calamarie, and then enjoyed
stolie and soda and a fantastic Padron Aniversario cigar.  Any
restaurant that has a humidor with a stogie selection like Schatze's
would be okay with me, but coupled with excellent food and very
friendly service, this is tops.  If anybody is in the area, I would
definitely stop in for a smoke.  They have an excellent selection of
single malts and ports also. We did not sample any, but it was still
nearly a hundred degrees outside, and stolie and soda sounded much
better.

Well, that is it.  Thanks for the work on the Digest, and if anyone
out there is in the vicinity of downtown Santa Monica, a trip to
Schatze's would be well worth the time.

I used to smoke it in the early 1970's. It was considered a "drugstore"
tobacco. I remember it being very mellow and pleasant smelling. I wish I
could still find it. Does anyone else remember Skallorna? I have an ad for
Skallorna which appeared in PLAYBOY magazine in the 1970's. It shows a
Robert Redford type smoking a Danish freehand pipe. The tobacco is described
as a mild cavendish mixture imported from Denmark. I seem to remember the 1
3/4 oz. packet was gold in color. 
     I just got back from the Labor Day New York pipe show. Another great

<a name="33">Subject: PIPE CRAFTING WORKSHOPS - A REPORT</a>

Dear Steve,

After experiencing my inauguration of a series of pipe-making workshops, this
summer, I'm convinced that deep inside many pipe smokers, there's a pipe carve
r struggling to get out.

If you recall, this past Spring I announced that I would give the workshops
during the months of July and August in the "beautiful green mountains of
Vermont".

I'm pleased to report that it was an immensley enjoyable experience for me
and the folks who attended judging from the pleased and proud expressions on
their faces as they departed, pipe in hand that they had completed
themselves.

I initially conceived the idea of offering pipe-making workshops after
noticing the surprising number of my PIMO customers that ordered pre-bored
briar blocks that they finished at home. And we were in a position to
accommodate the attendees in our home for the two-day period, thanks to my
wife Ginny, who had run a bed and breakfast operation for a number of years
in our house to which my workshop is attached. So it seemed like a natural
tie-in.

The offer even included the spouse's of the attendees at no additional cost
since our home is located in one of the most beautiful regions of Vermont at
the foot of the Green Mountains close to numerous cultural and recreational
resources.

In any event, the workshops went as follows:
Each attendee was provided with a package containing a brief description of
briar wood and its characteristics, a step by step diagram of briar boring
procedures and illustrations of typical standard and free-form shapes.

Day one consisted of design and layout of the proposed pipe; selection of an
appropriate Grecian plateau briar block; boring the tobacco and draft holes;
selection of an appropriate stem; trimming the stem's tenon to fit the shank
mortise; bandsawing excess briar; beginning the shaping of the stummel and
shank with a power sander.

Day two included finishing the shaping of the bowl and shank with hand
tools;sanding the stummel, shank and stem with a series of successively finer
sandpapers; applying a stain; buffing overall with tripole compund; applying
canauba wax and then a final buffing with a flannel buffing disk.

Prior to the actual hands-on work, each attendee was offered the choice of
design, ie; standard or free-form shape.

In addition I made a similarly shaped pipe concurrently so they could observe
and follow my procedures, step by step.

One of my pupils, Steve Gutz from Harvard, MA opted for a huge Canadian with
an extra long shank and we were both amazed on how well it turned out.

Another novice carver, Jim Martins, from Storrs, CT fashioned a beautiful
free-form pipe that would do credit to a master Danish pipe maker.

But the big surprise was the couple, Ralph and Lucille Ledone who flew in for
the workshops from Appleton, Wisc. In this instance, it was Lucille who had
signed up for the course. But Ralph decided to take a crack at it too. And to
our amazement, he turned out a  fabulous free-form, while Lucille crafted an
elegant, long stemmed beauty of a lady's pipe.

All in all, it was a delightful experience. So much so, that we intend to
offer an encore next summer

<a name="35">Subject: Pipe FAQ</a>

In your FAQ I agreed whole heartedly with the following paragraph:

"If you like smoking a pipe, why not get another? Or several? Most 
pipe smokers have some kind of a collection, since we like variety, 
and because pipes smoke better if they're given time to rest 
between smokes. I have about 25, but I've been building my 
collection for about 15 years. Make sure you've gotten to know the 
last pipe before you buy the next one, so you don't wind up with a 
lot of new, unsmoked pipes. It's OK to make mistakes; hardly anyone 
likes every pipe they buy."

The only things that I would add after so twenty-odd years (gee... 
has it been that long...!?!?) of pipe smoking is:

A. A serious smoker SHOULD have approximately 7-10 pipes to rotate 
and allow the others to 'rest'.  They tend to smoke better, in my 
humble opinion, if smoked for a day or two at most then allowed to 
rest after cleaning for about a week...  This is easy if you have 
several quality pipes (petersons, personally) as i'm sure you have 
also.

B. For those pipes you buy but just can't seem to find a liking to 
smoke.... hang on to them and use them for "give-a-ways" to friends 
who desire to learn the fine art of the pipe.  I have given away 
pipes that I've paid $50-$100 for simply because I just didn't like 
the smoke.  Rather than let them sit in my rack (and take valuable 
Peterson space) I present them to friends who want to learn the 
art.  The pipes appreciate the use, (i'm certain), and my friends 
definately appreciate it.  (Beside that, it makes me look 
incredibly magnanimous.)

Enjoyed the FAQ......

Dear Steve,

There was a piece in the Sept 2 issue of "Time" magazine stating that
anti-smoking legislation has recently turned to regulating <outdoor>
smoking.  In various parts of the country it is now illegal to either light
up near publicly used buildings or on public (usually municipal parks)
grounds.  Fines range up to $500 for violators.

Soon it will be illegal to smoke in your own house if you have a child
(child endangering), a pet (animal endangering), etc.  

If you think this is a new trend, think again.  I remember an insurance
company I worked for many years ago where the District Manager made
disparaging remarks to one of the agents about his weight at an office
meeting (he was very overweight, but he sold enough insurance to stay in the
game).  This was in the early 80's.  

Business believes it has the right to monitor all aspects of employees lives
as it affects employee performance, and ultimately, profit.  We no longer
live for ourselves but for the employer - are we ultimately allowing
ourselves to become slaves?

Personally I do not wish to "live longer" if living longer means I have to
live my whole life according to someone elses rules.

<a name="37">Subject: Pipes news & Questions</a>

Dear Steve & all, 

I've noticed that many people write in about their favorite tobacco 
shops.  There are two that I would like to recommend.  The first one is:

	The Tobacco Basket
	266 West Main Street
	Abingdon, Virginia  24210
	1-540-676-CIGR (2447)

This shop is owned by Frank & Nancy Markwalter.  Frank has blended 
several of his own blends as well as selling some bulk blends.  One of 
his blends is called "Franks Passion".  It is in the top five aromatics 
I have ever smoked.  If you are traveling on Interstate 81, the shop is 
two blocks off of it.  Take the middle Abingdon exit (there are three.)
By the way for all of you home brewers, they also sell brewing equipment 
and supplies.

The other shop is:

	Tobacco Road
	325 Clinchfield Street
	Kingsport, Tennessee  37660
	1-423-246-5417

The gentleman who owns this shop is knowledgeable and carrys a good 
selection.  Wayne has created some of his own blends as well as selling 
several bulk blends.  I especially like his blends: Mixture #13, Mixture 
#20, And Mixture #21.  All three of these are his own creations and are 
aromatics.  

I have been smoking aromatics since the early '80s and have just tried 
some English blends in the last four months.  They taste wonderful.  
There is nothing like a good stout Latakia blend (IMHO).  I have read 
several people's comments in P.D. about aged tobaccos.  They have all 
commented about aging tinned tobaccoes.  Has any one tried aging bulk 
tobaccoes like Cornell & Diehls.  I love them.  I would sure like to 
hear some of the experienced people's comments on this.

Two or three issues back a gentleman made a comment about some tobbaco 
making his throat hurt or burn and ask if Virginia was the cause.  It 
has been my experience that some blends with Burley in them cause this 
to happen to me.  Just thought I would stick my $0.02 worth in on the 
debate.

One more comment and I will hush.  In reading the back issues, I noticed 
several people commenting about having a tasting every month and then 
people commenting on the monthly or weekly tobacco.  I sure would like 
to read more experienced smokers comments on tobaccoes that are sold 
nation wide.  This would help me in choosing new blends to try.  For 
example: Balkan Sombranie has been mentioned more over the years than 
any other tobacco, yet I have never read anyones description of it.  It 
is not sold locally, and I would like to read comments about it before I 
mail-order some.

As always, Thanks for the wonderful job, Steve.

Earl J. Starbuck, Sr

[Earl, it may be too late for the Sobranie.  Several readers have
commented in recent issues that it may soon be discontinued. -S. ]

I guess it has been a while since I submitted anything to the digest.  I 
am now "back" to my pipes.  I have been a pipe smoker for the past 30 
years.  For the past 3, very little pipes, mainly cigars.  Good cigars 
are getting too expensive and scarce.  I find myself enjoying my pipes 
more than ever.  

WRT tobacco, I find myself settled down around "North Sea", and 
"Chartwell" from Tinderbox, and "Losantiville" from Strauss Tobacco in 
Cincinnati.  (I bought a bent calabash (briar, Armellini) from them while 
on a business trip, which started me back into my pipes).

WRT: Pipes---what a summer, picked up at local flea markets, a castello 
"Sea rock briar", a Ben Wade "spiral", and 3 Charatan makes, (Special, 
select-stratight grain, and a relief Canadian).  The first two for about 
$25 each, and the charatans for $5 each.  It was a good summer at the 
flea markets.  At these prices, who wants to buy a new pipe.

TPSE---What can I say, got vol. II and the latest mailings.  Tom keeps 
doing an excellent job.

PD Archives--I am in the process of downloading the PD archives and 
reading them.  I would wholey suport a CD rom version of PD and other 
pipe lore.

That's it for now.

OOPS, forgot to mention, that as of Sept 1, 1996 the Century III mall 
went totally smoke free.  Up till now, they at least had designated 
smoking areas.  So much for their interests in their customers.  I guess 
the only store that I will do business with there will be the Tinder 
Box.  (I wonder why they are in a smoke-free mall?).

CUL
John

Steve,
 
Scientists have not yet announced its discovery, but it is clear (to me,
after much personal experience) that a gene must exist-- I'll call it the
"joining gene"--that makes it impossible for people to join organizations.
They just can't do.  To help these organizationally impaired souls, we have
decided to offer the Ohio Pipe Collectors newsletter--"The Pipe Rack"--on a
subscription basis at the bargain rate of only $10 a year ($2.50 an issue).
To make the deal even more inviting, receive the last two issues of 1996
and all of 1997 for only $12 by sending your check to Ohio Pipe Collectors,
P.O. Box 9462, Columbus, OH 43209. (Of course, we still eagerly seek new
members at only $12 per year, pro-rated for new members.)
 
The Oct. newsletter will feature major pieces on Mark Tinsky, Curt Rollar
and the American Smoking Pipe Co. (a very long piece) and on Texas pipe
maker David Jones.  Every issue will continue to be as exciting and filled
with significant information as I can make
it.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

Greetings All.

I am new to the world of pipes and I just wanted to let everyone know
that this page is wonderful.  Also, I wanted to put in a plug for
Connolly's Smoke Shop in Chinchilla, PA (717) 587-3751. Jon Connoly is
as fine a man as ever smoked a pipe. He has a wonderful selection of
pipes, including some Boswell customs and some very nice cigars.

It was through Conolly's that I was reunited with an old friend who
had moved to Florida six years ago. I was in the smoke shop purchasing
some tobacco and a new briar when some on clapped me on the shoulder
and I turn around to see my good friend Mike. Needless to say we
caught up with each other over a few bowls of Connoly's Beryl blend at
the local pub. I guess there is always something good to be found in
the smoke shop.

I am an avid back packer and fly fisherman. Since I can barely
navigate the Appalachian Trail and smoke at the same time I am in awe
of those of you who can smoke and throw a fly.  Any how, if anyone is
in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area on a visit, or lives here I
encourage them to stop by Connoly's or e-mail me ????????????????

Steve: 
I hope this is the correct address to submit to the PD. I have never 
written before, but let me say I thoroughly enjoy reading the letters 
and articles in the PD. I have gotten much good information, and 
always have even more questions. I am still a novice to this pipe 
smoking, only having done it for about a year. I don't know all of the 
proper names for the types of tobacco or types of pipes, but I am 
learning. The FAQ you have was good primer, but my purpose in writing 
is twofold. First, I wanted to ask if you might recommend some good 
books or reading material on pipes and pipe tobacco.

Second, I am not a paid sponsor, so I hope this will pass. I simply 
wanted to alert pipe and cigar smokers in the Greenville/Upstate area 
of South Carolina who might not already know that Boda Pipes in 
McAlister Square Mall, Greenville, SC is moving to a new location 
within the mall. They will have an even bigger line and a new, larger 
humidor. It is worth checking out. The people are great, and it is a 
family-owned shop. They will definately take the time to help.

Thanks, and keep up the great work. Smoke in peace, all.

Quotes of the Week:

  Tobacco is a dirty weed,
  I like it.
  It satisfies no normal need,
  I like it.
  It makes you thin, it makes you lean,
  it takes the hair right off your bean.
  It's the worst damn stuff I've ever seen.
  I like it.
	                        -- Graham L. Hemminger
		                   (Penn State Froth 1915)


  Prohibition is an awful flop.
  We like it.
  It can't stop what it's meant to stop.
  We like it.
  It's left a trail of graft and slime,
  it don't prohibit worth a dime,
  it's filled our land with vice and crime.
  Nevertheless, we're for it.
				-- newspaperman Franklin P. Adams, 1931

[ADMIN] This issue, I'm introducing a new separator for the
cigar-related articles.  This should make it easier to find them (the
articles, not the cigars!)

[EMPLOYMENT] I noted that "Pipes and Tobaccos" magazine is looking for
a full-time pipe-smoking journalist.  A great opportunity for someone
to work on an excellent magazine!  Their address and phone number are
printed later in this issue; search for "Pipe publications."

[SHOW] Also, CORPS President Linwood Hines has asked me to announce
the Conclave of Richmond Pipe Smokers' "12th Annual Pipe Smoker's
Exposition and Celebration" ath the Holiday Inn, I-64 West Broad
Street, Richmond VA, on October 11-13.  For further information, call
the CORPS Hotline at (804) 342-0761, or mail ?????????????????????
I'm planning on attending, and will hope to see many of you there too!

And, as the autumn evenings take on a cool snap, light up your
preference and join us for one of our all-too-few fall issues...

Steve:

Let me echo the sentiments of so many: your efforts in producing
the Digest and supporting the liberties of pipe and cigar smokers
everywhere are greatly appreciated.  Thanks for pioneering the "inter-
netification" of pipe and cigar smoking.  Looking at what resources
we pipe and cigar smokers have on the internet, and realizing that it
all started with Pipes Digest, I am awed by the influence of your efforts.

Of course, the biggest impact of your work is upon those of us who
read and re-read the Digest with relish, and I sincerely thank you for
giving us that ability.  I have also come to appreciate how the Digest
has bettered the lives of news-group readers, web-page browsers, and
thousands of others.  Most folks don't even realize that they have you
and the other "pioneers" (including Elias Mazur, Bill Thacker, Sami
Mikhail, Steve Beaty, and all of the contributors to the Digest) to
thank for much of what they see on the internet. In addition to being
a source of information, Pipes Digest has been a source of
encouragement and inspiration to lots of people through the years.

I'm finishing up my second year as a subscriber.  While it seems sort of
inadequate, I just wanted to say, "thanks!"

Hello Fellow Smokers,

      I thoroughly enjoy my news letter, and have not written but as of late.
 I want to thank all of you for helping me enjoy my hobby to it's fullest.
 Although I am predominantly a gigar afficianado, I do dabble in the pipe
art.
      I would like to announce the newest addition to my town.  The soon to
open club is called the "Havana Club".  Amongst its inventory there is a wall
sized mural of the tobacco fields of the far south.  I was pleased to see
this classy joint opening up within walking distance of my home.  It is in
the town of Matawan, NJ.  I wish the owners well.
   On another note, I myself am looking for a humidor, and I do not care
about looks, I would prefer an antique, of high quality and affordable price.
 E me if anyone has one to part with.

Happy Smoking with Regards,
Joe

<a name="5">Subject: Humidors?</a>

First I want to introduce myself.  My name is Jason Sarsany and I am a
Senior at the University of Evansville in Indiana.  I am somewhat of a
novice to smoking a pipe, but with the information I got from the homepage
and the letters that have been circulating, I feel more and more like a
veteran everyday.  I won't bore you much longer with the demographics, but
I will give you fair warning.  I am new at this and am not ashamed of my
ignorance in this field.   That means that I may ask some stupid
questions, so please humor me (then again I'm a Psych. major  -- therefore
there are no stupid questions -- Right?!?).   

My first question is actually about cigar humidors?  Are there any tips to
the construction of them?  They look relatively simple in design and I am
contemplating making one for a good friend who loves a nice Macanudo from
time to time.  It is for graduation and I believe it would mean more if I
made it.  I have experience with woodworking and am confident I can build
it, but I hate to produce something that won't keep a cigar fresh.  Any
advice would be of great help.

Thanks again

Steve,
I have been reading in horror as at least two members of the group 
have supported the moves by the FDA toward control of tobacco. Don't 
they realize that if the FDA places controls on tobacco, it won't 
just be on the tobacco contained in cigarettes? Have these people not 
heard that the FDA wants to consider tobacco a narcotic drug and the 
cigarettes as a "drug delivery system"? Drug delivery systems are, by 
definition, tightly controlled in the USA. Just try to go and buy a 
syringe for insulin without the proper prescription. 
Ladies and gentlemen, if we allow the FDA to make tobacco a controlled 
substance, and they term cigarettes as drug delivery systems, I 
guarantee you that pipe tobacco will not be excluded and that pipes 
will also be labelled as drug delivery systems. Regardless how we may 
feel about cigarettes, this is not about teenagers smoking. This is 
about the loss of another freedom in America. As the man said, we 
will never submit to an outside force attacking our shores and 
limiting our freedom- but we will sit idly by and allow our 
Government to reduce our freedom slowly without saying a word.

Just my .02; mileage varies based on conditions

<a name="8">Subject: Things are not always what they seem</a>

It was Dick Morris, the inventor of mini-issues (who cheated on his wife with 
a mistress and cheated on his mistress with a whore -- is that a hat trick?) 
who whispered in the President's ear that tobacco was an issue with popular 
appeal and minimal downside. That is the same Dick Morris who, while advising 
the President, was at the same time a paid advisor to parties suing the 
tobacco companies on behalf of various states. Cozy, isn't it.

While the popular press was pounding Bob Dole over the head for his tobacco 
connections, they ignored the Morris/Clinton/Lawsuit nexus. The media proclaim 
that they do not present biased news, but they neglect to mention that they 
are the ones who decide what IS news. So you did not know of Morris's part in 
this unless you read the fine print near the end of an article in a weekly 
news magazine.

[ Deleted at Duane's suggestion. -S. ]

So when you see the reports about what lobby owns Bob Dole, ask yourself who 
owns Bill Clinton.

I cannot agree more that there is a happy medium.  That happy medium is
twofold: (1) We simply make some kinds of advertisments illegal.  While
I am unhappy with this provision on grounds of liberty, it seems to me
to be a modest sacrifice of speech rights to public opinion.  The real
force, however, is in the second proposal I have.  And, it is one that
no-one seems to advocate.  (2) We ought to require publicly-accessible
(indoor) places to post _very_ prominently their smoking policies, while
yet giving them the freedom to adopt any smoking policies they like.  We
should, moreover, distinguish between publicly-accessible and
fully-public places.  The latter are such as government buildings.  The
former are such as restaurants, taverns, &c.  I am not a rabid
free-marketer; but this seems to be an adequate compromise which allows
everyone the freedoms of association that we might value.

What I find most disturing in the author's suggestions (above), however,
is the author's apparent contentment with the elimination of some
freedoms in favour of some (perceived) wider good.  I am not too unhappy
with restriction of corporate freedoms: I am not convinced that
corporations ought to have the same sorts of freedoms that individuals
do, since the corporations are only amalgamations of individuals
anyway.  We can justifiably circumscribe corporations to the extent that
we do not similarly circumscribe individuals.  On the other hand, I am
perturbed by the suggestion that we ought to treat adults as children in
order that advertising companies be free to treat children as adults. 
It is likely that children do not have the critical skills which are
required to evalutate the (often specious) claims of tobacco companies. 
That seems to be good reason to control the claims of those companies,
and not to try to control the behaviour of adults who choose a practice
(like smoking tobacco) in full knowledge of its potential effects.

My parents didn't really need to be told of my love of a pipe.  Nobody
smoked in the house, so I never did either.  But, I smoked often enough
that the scent was hard to miss on my overcoat.  I never worried about
it; rather, I simply made my decision as an adult, and hoped to be
treated as one who was qualified to make such decisions.  My parents did
treat me so.  

Similarly, once I had decided that I enjoyed pipe smoking, it was not
long before I found that my enjoyment was compatible with other
practices.  In particular, I found that, if I was out with friends,
having a drink or two, a pipe had a fantastic appeal.  It was a short
jump from there to just pulling my pipe out and smoking it.  Nobody
objected, though I did get ribbed for being old before my time.  Of
course, I was helped by meeting a rather lovely woman who swooned at the
scent of a pipe.  My friends were all envious.  Eventually, that woman
dumped me.  I still have my pipe, though.

Sweetest smoke,
Andrew Sullivan

Bijan,
	I am young. I will not reveal my age, but I am below 20. I tried
cigarettes at one time and didn't like them at all. I guess it was because
I had tried cigars first, and loved them so much. Pipes are so great. And
so much different than cigarrette smoking. I have smoked cigars since I
was 17......

I'm a 23 years young student in the netherlands and I started pipe smoking
a couple of years ago. The story of how I started is the same story of
telling my parents about it:
My parents are both non smoking and in preventing their children from
smoking they promised them that they would pay for the driving lessons
(wich are rather expensive in the netherlands) If we (the children) did not
start smoking before the age of 18 (that's the age one is allowed to get
driving lessons). However, if we did start smoking before the age of 21 we
should pay all the lessons back to our parents. (This was all in a
contract, made up by my eldest brother)
So I always said I would start smoking at the age of 21 and indeed so I
did, and now I have my driving-licence and am a happy smoker.
But why pipe? well, I always liked the smell of it when someone smoked a
pipe, so i decided to try it myself. (and because I always wanted to be
different from like other people... :-)  ) And I like it!
And about my parents: they just think I should make my own decissions and
they do like the smell of it, so they accepted it and even gave me tabacco
etc. on my birthday !

> I still find it difficult to smoke with confidence in public -
> probably because of my age.   Can anyone help me on this?

What should we do? smoke it for you ? :-)  Just do it... I experienced
people finding it kind-of possitvely funny seeing young people smoking
pipe. They don't expect it, i think.
When I smoke a pipe in the smoking area of a train I never get negative
reactions, but when I smoke a cigar (like them too!) in the smoking area of
a train I once heared somewehere behind me 'aach.. a cigar!', while they
were smoking cigarettes themselves......

Smoke in peace

     Charl,
     
     I don't think you have to worry about your age as much as you 
     seem to. First of all, 22 isn't that young. Second, I think
     you might be convincing yourself that other people think your
     habit is bizarre when in fact "they" don't. It seems that you
     think your habit is bizarre, at least "for your age," and so
     you are projecting this conceived notion into other people's
     heads.
     
     Just forget about it and smoke 'em if you've got 'em.
     
     I began smoking cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco all at the
     same time, at the age of 16. I am 24 now.
     
     It was the summer between my Sophomore and Junior year of High-
     School when me and my best friend went to Oxford University for
     a summer history program.
     
     We left San Francisco and landed in New York, where we spent a
     week just visiting people. We stayed with my aunt in her apt.
     on East 64th Street, between Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue. Our
     first cigars were stolen from her boyfriend's humidor and we
     loved them. We strolled the shopping areas in the summer heat
     just puffing away - dizzy from the nicotine / Green from the
     dizziness. 
     
     An old man, perched on a high stool outside a bar, asked us 
     what "the hell we were doin' with those seegars" and we gave him 
     one. His eyes bugged out when he looked at the band - I wish I 
     could remember what they were but it was in 1988 it was my 
     first one....
     
     The guy invited us into his place, it was dark and there was no
     one inside but he told us to "climb up a stool" and he'd 
     take care of us. He gave us Rum, and when our cigars were all
     finished, he gave us cigarettes.
     
     Later that week we went with my aunt to Long Island, to stay at
     her boyfriend's summer house, East Hampton, Manhasset -something
     like that. Anyway, at some little tobacco store we found corn-
     cob pipes and we bought them. Having no actual tobacco, we 
     bought cigarettes from a vending machine in a movie theater
     and crumbled them up into the pipes - I don't remember the 
     taste and I can't remember what ever happened to that pipe, but
     that was a great buzz!
     
     --------
     
     We settled into our room in St. Claire's, Oxford and after 
     getting oriented to the school, went exploring the town. Our 
     first night there we discovered The Lamb and the Flag, a great
     bar in the English tradition. Steak for supper, and cigars
     from behind the bar to go along with our beer. 
     
     Eventually I bought a pipe that was a little nicer than the 
     corn cob thing and a tin of tobacco to go along with
     it. Again, I can almost remember what kind it was, but not 
     quite. At the same time I bought some cigarette rolling tobacco
     and a pack of filterless Gouloise.
     
     I have fond memories of that summer; some bus rides to London,
     a trip to Paris, practically all of my suppers taken in bars
     and a lot of smoking and drinking. Another great bar that was
     in Oxford was the Blue Bear on Boar Street, or perhaps, the 
     Blue Boar on Bear Street. Either way, it is set in a cobble
     stone alley with large stone "picnic" benches outside and 
     inside, all of the walls were covered with the regimental ties
     of all sorts dating back to the beginning of each. Some of 
     them, The 7th Dragoon to name just one, were a few hundred 
     years old.
     
     Almost everywhere I went; Merlin's Cave on the coast near
     Glastonbury, the remains of what was supposedly King Arthur's
     Castle, Bath and the blarney stone itself I smoked my pipe.
     
     I don't know whatever happened to that pipe, or the empty tin
     of tobacco I stuffed into my luggage along with an assortment
     of ashtrays and pub drinking glasses but I will always remember
     the smell of the tobacco and taste of the smoke.
     
     When I returned home I was a smoker. I went to the humidor that
     my father had brought home from my Grandfather's office after
     he died and discovered pipes.
     
     Well, that seems like a long time ago, in fact, I guess you 
     could say it's been a third of my life. I gave up cigarettes
     all together not too long ago but my own humidor is nice and 
     full, my pipes are well smoked and I have recently (3 years
     ago) taken up the Agreela, or hooka. You see, there is this
     middle eastern restaurant in San Francisco that I have been 
     going to at least twice a month for three years now where they
     have Egyptian water pipes you can rent for $7, filled with
     authentic tobacco and piled high atop with the coals they use
     in the mid-east. Wonderful.
     
     As far as telling your parents, well that's up to you. 
     
     Personally, I would just tell them I had taken up pipe smoking
     and had grown attached to it. Don't smoke it in front of them
     just yet - but you might as well face it, you're a smoker now.
     
     Adam.

Charl,

	I am a 34 year old pipe smoker. I suggest you just do it! Set
the pace. A friend of mine used to work in a drug store. One of his
favorite isles to stock was the tobacco. He loved the smells. In fact
he used cherry pipe tobacco as air freshner for his car. After several
of his dates asked if he smoked a pipe- he picked up a pipe and tried
it. He has not turned back since- not to mention has had many
wonderful dates with above average women. They could spot his
sensitive and good nature not to mention his wonderful taste. You see
a good woman can spot the slow, well thought out, smooth nature of a
pipe smoker. She can see his skill and concern, and attention to
detail. All this to say anyone who frowns and looks down at you, is
probaly the same kind of person who called other childern names as a
child- and has not a clue to what life is about.

	At 22, you are a man. Step out and forge the path that will be
yours. Put aside others views and thoughts and take on your own. Life
is too short to let others control what you think and do. Embrace what
you enjoy.

	As for your parents, my father smoked a pipe, and my mother
now smokes cigarettes. Thus in our house it was acceptalbe to smoke-
when of age.  Respect what you parents want in their home. If you
'need' to tell them, tell them-remind them you are an adult, and will
respect their home. But you make your own choices now. I know when my
father was alive- this made him proud to know I could stand my ground
and live 'my' life, not one choosen by him or anyone else.

	The only age to begin or consider smoking a pipe is that which
is legal.  Respect for the laws of the land is most important. If we
don't like the laws we should seek to change them, but ignore them
sets us back years in our development as civilized people.

	Make your choices with thought and care. Smoke in peace.

Grant Porter

Steve,

I was awfully glad to see you group the cigar messages together in one
place. I have a mild and passing interest in cigars (or, rather I should say
that I _did_ until it got popular and the prices went through the roof!),
but I am curious as to why the Pipe's Digest carries cigar messages at all.
Let 'em get there own!

Speaking of which, I sat down and read PD 223 immediately upon receipt. I am
always pleased to "have" to carve that little bit of time out of my day to
read it through and through. My only problem is that the way the PD comes
out, it's hard to carry on a conversation with my fellow pipe smokers. Is
there (or are there plans for) a pipe smoking list server with "real time"

No, Steve, I don't agree. It wasn't just a flop, it was a tragedy: possibly
the biggest mistake in the history of your country. Alcohol prohibition,
with its prospects for good illegal business, along with the inflexibility
of prefect Mori whom the Fascist government of Italy had charged with
unlimited powers to fight the Mafia, caused the migration of the latter from
Sicily to the United States- with the results we have before us today.

cigars on and off since I was twenty.  Mostly off until a friend introduced
me to quality pipes and tobaccos.  Tom Eddleman of Jackson,MS gave me a
Savenelli dry system pipe and I was on my way.  I had been smoking Dr.
Grabow Omega pipes and Borkum Riff.  I now have a few Savinelli pipes but
mostly perfer Peterson system pipes.

        I would like to submit a couple on tobacconist's for your resource

Steve has a variety of quality pipes including a numbered gold band Mark
Twain. He had a silver band until I spied it in the cabinet and gave it a
new home on my rack.  I had about despaired of ever finding one and then
stumbeled on two at the same shop, just lucky I guess.
Steve also has a good selection of quality cigars in his walk in humidor.

COLUMBUS SHOW REPORT

The Ohio Pipe Collectors held a fantastic show on Saturday, September
14.  Bill Unger, Regis McCafferty, Steve Richey and a lot of others
worked long and hard on all the arrangements for their 1996 event, and
their dedication was evident by its success.

The activity began in the hotel bar Friday night, with a bunch of pipe
nuts getting a head start on the show.  The pre-show festivities
continued in Chuck Rio's room later that evening, where the Chicago
contingent hosted their typical hospitality event.  (With adrenalin
still running high after the show, more than a dozen folks congregated
there again Saturday night, when we popped a 40-year-old tin of
Dunhill Early Morning Pipe tobacco...pure ambrosia...and finally went
to bed around 3:00 Sunday morning.)

The hotel's ballroom was full, with 64 tables of pipes, tobacco, pipe
books and magazines, and related tobacciana.  Actually, the show was a
sellout last month, with 61 tables rented.  Three more tables were
reserved for the pipe smoking contest, but with the demand so high,
Bill and his cohorts decided to cancel the contest and make those
three tables available to exhibitors.  They could have rented even
more had space been available.

Walk-in attendance was great, thanks to the publicity OPC generated
through print and broadcast media, plus a lot of advance promotion by
local pipe shops.  I estimate 200-300 persons came in to browse, buy
and/or swap.  There were times when some of the aisles were so packed
with people, it was hard to get from one table to another.  Quite a
few seemed to be younger, beginning pipe smokers, and it looked like
they were upgrading from board pipes to things like Petersons and GBDs
in the $20-$40 price range.

The demand for collectible pipes was high, too.  Bob Hamlin was so busy he
didn't even take a break for lunch; in fact, I didn't see him sit down the
entire day.  (I love the Castello I got from you, Bob!)  Nikos Levin said his
greatest demand was for classic English brands.  Mel Feldman was inundated with
collectors wanting to trade for his wares, which numbered in the thousands of
pipes. The American pipemakers in attendance got a lot of attention, and
deservedly so, because the quality of their craftsmanship was absolutely world
class.  

Overall, those looking to buy and to sell quality used pipes in the $75 to $125
price range had a field day.  The demand for older Dunhills far exceeded the
supply, at least in price ranges folks were willing to pay.  Pre-transition
Barlings switched hands through swapping, not selling.  I saw only a handful of
Charatans in the Executive grades and above.  Comparatively few used Castellos,
Mastros, Jacopos and other Italian makes were available in the higher grades.
It looks like more and more collectors are holding on to what they have.  When
they decide to unload a piece, they prefer to trade.  When they do sell, the
prices they're asking today are higher than what we've seen in the past. 

Craig Tarler began the show with a bunch of his wonderful bulk tobaccos, but he
left with a much lightened load that evening.  The PCCA specialty blends
produced by McClellands were there in abundance.  Vintage tobacco lovers were
pleased, too, at finding such deals as Escudo for $12.50 to $15.00 per tin.
Pipe literature lovers had the opportunity to acquire old Pipe Lovers and Pipe
Smoker magazines, books, pamphlets and other such neat stuff.

The show ended with a raffle of donated pipes, tobacco and related items.
Raffle tickets cost a dollar each.  As evidence of the quality of these items,
one guy bought 300--not a typo, that's three hundred--tickets alone.

If all this wasn't enough, the opportunities to make new friends and
see old ones in this hobby was reason alone to attend.  (I wish there
had been name tags at the entrance; I'm sure that some of you I know
only electronically were there, but I was unable to attach names to
faces.)  And the education one can achieve at a pipe show is
incredible.  Want to date a Dunhill?  Learn about the nomenclature on
a Castello?  Find out the history of a particular brand?  Discuss
techniques to recondition pipes?  Talk to a pipemaker about how one is
made?  You could do all that, and more, in Columbus.

Thanks to all the members of the Ohio Pipe Collectors for a great
time.  I'll be back next year!

Steve,

Thanks for all the hard work on the Digest...it just keeps getting better and
better.

I am celebrating my 1-year anniversary as a pipe enthusiast and I
thought that it would be great to "give something back." I have
interest in computers and specifically database design, and this gives
me an idea. Have you or anyone else you know put the Resource Guide
into a database or some type of tab- or comma- delimited text file? If
not, it is a project I would gladly take on in my spare time...not
only the initial design and data entry, but the updating as well. I
have spent much time scrolling through the huge resource guide or
using Netscape's inefficient "find" to get to something I needed. A
database file, importable into either a database app. like Access or
Filemaker, or a spreadsheet like Excel, would really be great for
searches, sorting, etc.

Please, let me know what you think. If it's already been done, please let me
know where to get a copy.

Thanks again!

Hi Steve,

I have been reading the digest for some time now and I really enjoy it. 
Please keep up the good work.

I have a question about additives in some tobacco.  I smoke Chartwell
from the Tinder Box which I have grown very fond of.  I recently went on
a vacation so before I left I went to the T.B. to pick up a fresh supply
but upon arrival I was told that they were sold out. Major
disappointment!

I went to the drug store and purchased Captain Black which I use to
smoke before I tried Chartwell.  It lacked the golden cavendish so I
bought the C.B. gold and mixed the two together and came up with a
reasonable facsimile of Chartwell.

I remember reading in one of the past issues about store bought brands
and some of the additives that are added.  Is C.B. one of these
tobaccos?  Does the Tinder Box have the same problem with their
tobacco?  What are the additives that are placed in some of the tobaccos
that are no-nos.

If you, or any of our readers, remember what issue(s) this discussion
took place in I'll grab that one via ftp.

Thanks in advance.

Terry.

[ Propylene glycol is one additive that's used as a moistening agent;
too heavy a dose will make the tobacco taste like soap.  And all

Now, I don't mean to resurrect the debate about whether or
not zippos are good for lighting your smoke; most of us have
heard both sides of the debate (Works great! Tastes funny!)
and have already made our decisions.

I was in my local tobacconist perusing the 1996 Zippo catalog,
and happened to flip to the pages where they describe the
process of ordering your own *custom imprinted* lighters.
Various methods of etching, engraving, and enameling exist,
and the minimum order for any design is just fifty lighters.

So I had the idea that maybe some members of the list would
be interested in going in together on such an order. I don't
yet know how much each lighter would cost, or what the design
would be, but if there's enough interest, I could look into it.

My first idea for a design is based on the signature file of
the digest, and would be printed in bright green on a black
lighter to give that "computer monitor" feeling.

For those of you who are thinking "here's somebody trying to make a
quick buck," I would be offering the lighters on a cost recovery basis,
charging only enough to cover the imprinting fees, lighters, shipping,
and suchlike. My figures would be public and easily checkable.

With the thousands of people on this list maybe fifty will be
interested.  If you're interested, please send *me* (not the list) a

<a name="25">Subject: Re: Hot Bowl</a>

Steve,

If I may deal with this topic in my usual detailed verbose
fashion:

I find that there are a number of factors that can influence
how hot the bowl gets, and discerning which is the problem
is (as always) the key to solving it.

Hard puffing can, of course, cause any pipe to overheat.  But 
if one is reasonably consistent in how one puffs, and some 
pipes get hot but others do not, one must look elsewhere for
the problem.

Tobacco packed either too loose or too tight can be the culprit.  
If too loose, too much air flow fans the flames and generates 
excessive heat.  If too tight, the air drawn through the tobacco 
will find a small path of least resistance, and funnel through 
it, creating a localized chimney of rapid combustion and excessive 
heat.  If the chimney is right next to the wall, this can burn through 
the carbon cake and initiate a burn-through, though such is rare.

Coarse-cut tobaccos tend to burn much more slowly than fine-cut 
ones, and Virginia tends to burn faster than burley.  Moisture, of 
course, is a factor.  If too dry, the tobacco burns quickly and the 
fire is hot, but contrarily tobacco too wet does not burn slowly 
and cool.  It does not burn at all unless you puff hard enough to 
keep the fire at a temperature that will vaporize the moisture and 
ensure that the fire continues to spread, and that temperature is 
usually too hot.

A pipe with a larger-diameter bowl will tend to smoke cooler 
than one with a smaller-diameter bowl, for a couple of reasons.
One is that air flow is more diffuse, and does not "fan the flames"
as much in any one area.  Another is that neither air nor 
tobacco at proper moisture content conduct heat readily.  This 
leads to a topic worth addressing in some detail.

Many a time I have read and heard of pipes that "dissipate heat"
well and therefore smoke cool.  It seems to me, that they smoke 
cool precisely because they do NOT dissipate heat.  They insulate 
well, keeping the heat in the bowl rather than dissipating
it.  Several factors affect effectiveness as an  insulator: 
the nature of the wood (porous grain structure, but containing 
little or no moisture or sap that would transfer heat readily); the
carbon cake lining the bowl (the low-density cake that usually
forms in a pipe is a good insulator, though high-density carbon
transmits heat readily); and the density of the wood (lighter or 
less dense is better).

When the bowl and carbon cake lining it serve as a good insulator,
it is easy to keep the tobacco burning at a temperature just high 
enough to yield full flavor.  When they fail to insulate effectively, 
you must puff hard enough to overcome rapid heat loss and still 
keep the tobacco burning, and the combustion temperature is 
necessarily significantly higher.  

Returning to the larger bowl factor, tobacco of proper moisture content
is itself a good  insulator, much better in fact that either carbon cake
or even good  briar.  The fire burning toward the center of the larger bowl
is better  insulated, and the larger the diameter of the bowl the better
the insulation for that central portion, and the larger the area that 
is well insulated.  Net result:  Better wood, a thicker cake, and a
larger-diameter bowl will all contribute to a cooler  smoke, other things
(puffing style, tobacco, moisture, etc) being  more or less equal.

In closing, I would propose that if a pipe is smoking hot, first consider 
puffing more gently, as this is an easy change to make.  If that does not
do the trick, I would next try getting some bland-tasting but very slow 
and cool burning tobacco from a tobacconist that makes up house blends
(he will have at least one such tobacco in stock, for blending) and mix 
that with whatever you like the taste of but that is burning hot.  Next, I 
would let the pipe rest for a few weeks, to dry out thoroughly.  Moisture 
in the wood can cause the heat-transfer rate to soar, and result in a hot 
bowl and a hot smoke.  If the preceding still fail to cool things down,
you need either more carbon cake lining the bowl or a pipe made of 
better wood.

[ I'd disagree that larger bowls always smoke cooler, though; in my
experience, there's a range of bowl sizes that smoke cool, and going
outside this range either way can result in a hot smoke. -S. ]

looking for a mild aromatic tobacco. At the local CVS drugstore, I liked
Vanilla Cavendish, Black & Gold Cavendish, Toasted Cavendish, Captain Black
Blue Label, and Burley & Black. At the local NewsShop, I liked the aroma of
Vanilla Twist and White Mountain Special. Can you give me your opinion of
these tobaccoes? 

Thanks again. Your assistance is most appreciated.

How about a consumers' guide to global tobacco prices? Nice if
you travel a lot. I have found some prices in Denmark, Germany
and Czech Republic for Dunhill and Capstan which probably are
available in most countries. And Steve, maybe you could make
some kind of a list so letters about prices won't take too
much space in PD. And thanks for you good work - it leads
to more work as you can see!

The prices are in USD +/- 10% since the dollar sometimes
varies quite a lot compared to currencies in the European
Community (or maybe our currencies are flowing; but with
my European eyes...) Enough of that: here are some prices:

Dunhill Light Flake: Denmark 10.30, Germany 13.30, Czech R. 3.60
Dunhill Mixture 965: Denmark  9.70, Germany 10.80, Czech R. 4.60
Capstan Medium Navy: Denmark  7.90, Germany  9.30, Czech R. 3.50

Well, it seems like a good idea to visit CR if you want
to spend your holiday smoking pipe - also recommended
because of general low prices, friendly people, a lot of
culture/history, and last but not least the fabulous beer!

Sincerly,
Jesper Klith, Denmark

Hello, Steve,

Well, it seems I'm losing my taste for aromatic tobacco blends.  I smoked   
nothing but aromatics for many years, but late last year I got turned on   
to the Virginia-based blends manufactured by McClelland (both under   
McClelland's own label and those limited edition blends manufactured for   
Bob Hamlin's PCCA).  I recommend these highly to anyone.  A few issues   
ago I sent out a call for information regarding tobacconists who carried   
the Esoterica Tobacciana blends and wound up ordering several from   
Sherlock's Haven in San Francisco.  So far I've smoked Penzance and   
Dorchester and love them both.  These tobaccos really are as good as I've   
heard.  I still smoke an aromatic once in awhile, mainly to make my wife   
or friends happy, but I certainly don't enjoy them as much as I used to   
and certainly not as much as I enjoy the McClelland and Estoterica   
blends.

In the last issue of the Digest, Terry Jones asked about aging bulk   
tobaccos.  I asked this same question of Bob Hamlin after reading an   
article on his homepage   
(<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rchpcca)">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/rchpcca)</a> about aging tobacco.   
 He replied that yes, bulk tobacco could be aged if a) it was not cased   
(i.e., aromatics) and b) if it was stored in airtight containers such as   
Tupperware/Rubbermaid.  Minimum handling of the tobacco is also   
recommended as this reduces the chance of mold-producing bacteria   
transferring from hand to tobacco.  Also, for those who can, storing the   
tobacco in the proper environment (constant temperature of 65-70 degrees)   
is also best.  I, however, don't have a place with I can keep tobacco at   
a constant temperature, but I have several bulk blends stored in   
Rubbermaid containers that are still good after a couple years.  Perhaps   
others whose experience outstrips mine can add to this.

Also in last issue, Lim Keng Hong asked about ordering Weber's guide to   
pipes and pipe smoking.  You replied that it hadn't been published in   
over 30 years.  When I was in Denver this past April, I visited Jeri's in   
downtown and bought a brand-new copy of the book in paperback (I think I   
cost me $8.95 or $9.95).  Perhaps it's back in print (I don't have it in   
front of me, so I can't look at the print date)?  Anyway Jeri's is in the   
Guide so Lim might want to call and see if they have any more copies for   
sale.

I guess that's all for this time, so I'll sign off.

I'd like to Subscribe to the "Pipes Digest Mailing List".  I'm fairly new
to pipe smoking, and am looking for as much information on pipe smoking as
i can find, as well as trying to find a Niche of pipe smokers that i might
beable to fit into.  My wife and I live in the Mountains of Eastern
Kentucky, and we find it difficult to find anything out about anything.  We
drive 1 hour (each way) to go grocery shopping, and know of only one store
within 2-3 hours of driving that sells pipes and tabbaccos of any quality,
and the store is very small with very little to offer.  We can get the Big
brands (Carter Hall, Half & Half, Sir Walter Raleigh, Prince Albert, and a
few others) just about anywhere even gas stations.  And finding Pipe
cleaners and Pipe sweetener doesn't seem that difficult either.  Its just
all the locations but this one small hole in the wall only have Dr. Grabby
& Corn Cob brand pipes.  I'm sure someone really likes them but I've been
told they are not of the higher quality brand pipes.  I've found myself a
Jobey from France that smokes pretty good, actually a whole lot better then
the other said brands..  Anyhow can ya add me to the list server?

Many Thanks!

  Steve,
   I understand. We live in an area without local access numbers which
makes internet connection rather expensive-----and Juno is a free service
so it's the obvious choice until a local access number comes along in a
month or two, at least that's what we've been told. When we do get a
local number and get back to another e-mail connect i'll contact you
again. By the way have you heard of a pipe  called a  Claude Romain
Silverado? It's a pipe my father in law gave me that apparently has a bit
of age on it. It's a bent with military mount and rough sandblast finish.
It is or was made in France where he was stationed in WW II

I subscribed to PIPE DIGEST in early June.  So far I've read about
half the back issues and all the issues sent to me.  What a wealth of
information!  The first item I attended to was to find someone who
could replace a stem on a hand made pipe I had recently received.  I
had read about Mark Tinksley.  I found his web site and decided to
send him and e-mail to see if he wanted to take a look at my pipe.
After a couple of e-mails between us, i shipped him the pipe.  It
arrived back within the week with a beautiful stem.  Then I became the
owner of one of Mark's pipes from his recently released UNIQUE
seriesl.  I own U34.  Then I read of the OHIO pipe's smoker convention
in Columbus.  As we live within a 100 miles, my wife and I decided to
check it out.  We had a marvelous day.  I traded a little and bought a
little.  From that show, I began to purchase Cornell & Diehl tobacco.
So, as you can see, I've managed to make very good use of the Pipe
Digest.  Keep up the good work. PAX

<a name="36">Subject: Alternative Woods for Smoking Pipes</a>

Hi Steve: 
Mark Tinsky and I have been having a dialogue recently about the
feasibility/desirability of making pipes from some of the more exotic
woods. Researching the issue, I came across two articles, published in
the 40s which provide fascinating insights into pipe production of 50+
years ago.

During the Second World War the supply of Briar for pipe making was
either drastically reduced or eliminated. As a result, U.S. pipemakers
began looking around for alternate sources of wood suitable for making
pipes. Three woods, Mountain Laurel; Rhododendron and Manzanita were
actually used for the production of pipes. A fourth, Redshanks, while
producing suitable burls of good quality, was found to be too hard to
work into pipe blocks profitably.  

My initial impression was that these woods were only used for a few
pipes on an experimental basis, but I was astounded to read that there
were 7 plants in North Carolina and Tennessee, most of them using Laurel
burls exclusively, in operation !! The articles go on to report that the
combined weekly requirement of all 7 Appalachian plants in 1941 was
approximately 400,000 lbs of burl which produced 176,000 blocks. The
articles arent specific as to how much manzanita production amounted
to, but one article reports, In midsummer of 1941 two relatively large
block mills were established in California to cut Manzanita grown in
Santa Cruz and Monterey counties Both of these mills are associated with
large pipe companies. More recently (1942) another plant has been
established in trhe area and there were plans for a fourth.

The two articles differ in their reporting of the total requirerments of
theU.S. pipe making industry. One article reports as follows, If these
7 plants (Appalachian) should operate only forty-six weeks out of the
year their production would amount to slightly over 8,000,000 blocks
annually. This indicates that apparently about one-fourth of the entire
requirments of the United States is provided by the present (1941)
southern Appalachian industry. The second article states, The American
smoking pipe industry (has) an estimated current demand for 40,000,000
blocks annually...  Regardless of which estimate is used, it seems to
have been quite an industry !!

The articles also report peripherally on the economic side of the pipe
making industry of 50+ years ago. In 1941 the manufacture of pipes was
estimated as an industry to be valued at $8,000,000 annually. The
article also reports that Brier pipes retailed at 25 cents and up and
that there was a large market for pipes selling at less than $1.00.
Allowing for a small proportion of high priced pipes, this would suggest
that somewhere around 10,000,000 pipes would have been sold annually in
the U.S. 

Prices for Brier blocks also recall a by-gone era. Before the war,
Pipemakers were paying about 2 cents/block. By 1941 this had increased
to 8 cents for imported brier blocks, when they were available, as
compared to 6 cents for domestic blocks that were suitable substitutes
for Brier.

Given the figures contained in the articles, I would presume that there
must be quite a few of these alternative pipes still in circulation. I
have no idea whether they were identified as being made from wood other
than Brier or whether the pipe makers concealed their identity. Both
Mark and I would be really interested in hearing from older members who
may have had first-hand experience smoking these pipes and we would each
be interested in acquiring on or two examples for our collections. Kind
regards, Bob Holmes

[SHAMELESS HUCKSTERING] Due to the energetic efforts of Vince Callaway
(???????????????) and Steve Beaty (???????????????), the Pipes Digest
is now able to offer vanity email addresses at (you guessed it!)
pipes.org.  These are receive-only email addresses that forward all
mail to your own account.

They're fun, and practical, too! Is your present address something
like ???????????????????????????????????  Get a spiffy new one!  How
about "?????????????????"? It's still available!

The pipes.org addresses are practical because they're stable. They'll
remain constant places to get your mail, regardless of whether you
change your job or ISP.

The price is $25 for the first year, $20 for successive years.  All
net profits go to finance Pipes Digest activities (i.e., paying for
the domain name and some other stuff that costs us real moolah.)  If
there's any left over, we'll think of something to do for the benefit
of the membership.

Email to ????????????????? for details!

<a name="2">Subject: A Dissenting Voice...</a>

Hello All <===~~~

Since we have so much in common, I thought I'd take a risk and voice a
little dissent.

I love cigars. But I'd give them up *immediately* if I could save just
one cigarette smoker's life.

Not everyone agrees with me (obviously). Here's a sampling of reasons
I've heard:

1. The right to kill yourself with cigarettes is important.
2. It's the thin edge of the wedge... next they'll take away my vote...
3. Good idea, bad law/implementation/methodology

I'm personally in the third camp.

I don't belive we have some important right to do as we please,
especially when most of the cost of lung cancer is borne by society (at
least it is here in Canada). No surprise, I'm also against the
proliferation of weaponry and in favour of the minimum wage. I also
don't belive that in order to keep some important freedoms we have to
allow total anarchy. IMHO, the right to make a living by selling a
device which kills the user is well on the other side of reasonable
freedoms.

But these laws I hear about... whoa!  What nonsense. Either cigarettes
are bad (my belief), in which case ban them outright and balance the
jobs and political unrest against the lives saved and productivity
gained. Or cigarettes aren't bad (who's kidding whom???) in which case
let the kiddies buy them.

Enough! Smoke while you still can...

[ With respect to the costs being borne by society, the health care
does not come for just the price of the taxes.  Support implies
control.  TANSTAAFL, after all.

And please recall that in the past, jazz music was also been labelled
"bad" by much of society, and that motorcycles are a demonstrably more
dangerous form of transportation than cars. Your argument would also
subject both of these to prohibition: one on the grounds that it is
considered "bad," and the other on the grounds that it incurs risk to

Steve-

This is my first post in response to the digest; if I have the protocol 
wrong, just let me know.  Feel free to edit the above out.

In the last digest a reader raised the cry that the recent FDA moves 
to classify tobacco a drug and cigarettes drug-delivery-systems signal 
eventual classification of pipes/cigars and their tobacco forms 
likewise.  This is not good according to the contributor.

I am afraid that thinking like this is precisely why this country of ours 
is in the muddle it is in regarding drugs.  Let's be real with ourselves 
here: TOBACCO IS A DRUG. So too are coffee, alcohol, cocaine, marijuana as 
well as a host of other substances.

Our government does have the right to protect citizens from the acts of 
other citizens.  Hence reckless driving should be controlled.  The 
misrepresentation of products should be controlled.  The use of tobacco 
in public places (as compared to private homes and clubs) should be 
controlled.   Unfortunately the government, aided by misguided 
citizens, has also chosen to regulate individual choice: eg. seatbelts in 
cars, motorcycle helmets.  The use of drugs is simply another example.

Another astute reader pointed out that the likely crime implications of a 
prohibition on tobacco.  Look at our drug regulation problems NOW!  We 
are spending 100s of Millions of Dollars on regulating individual choice.

Instead of fighting the inherent truths: 1) tobacco is a drug and 2) 
tobacco is harmful if abused, we should be focusing our energy on ridding 
our government of its abuse of our rights as individuals in many areas.  
Consistency will win the day.

N.

[ I quite agree, Nathan, that tobacco is a drug.  The problem is that
the director of the FDA is not acting out of some sense of academic
pedantry, but rather to extend the domain he controls.  The term
"drug" is also perjorative (though it shouldn't be; aspirin is also a
drug.)

We shouldn't lie for our cause, true -- but neither should we trust
men of unlimited ambition. -S. ]

I'm 20 turning 21 in December and I've been smoking a pipe for about 
a month or two now, so you are not alone.

I have found pipe smoking is more of a mind set then actually smoking.
My wife smokes Salem Cigarettes, and it relaxes her but its in a
different manor.  If she is driving and someone cuts her off, or if
anything gets her frustrated the first thing she will do is roll the
window down abit and pop one of them Salems in her mouth and suck it
down.  For her its a to cool down when she is flustered.  For me
however i don't think i could ever use a pipe in that fashion.  We
live in the Mountains of Eastern Kentucky and atleast every other
weekend go somewhere to relax.  We have a Special spot in the middle
of know where along a small pebble bank of a creek with nothing in
sight but trees.  We relax fishing, reading to each other, and usually
have a small camp fire going to roast hotdogs or marshmallows on.
When I am in the right mood i really enjoy my pipe.

As for in public, I'd have to say i don't really feel that comfortable
smoking in public.  If i was in public and the mood was right, sure
I'd probably break my pipe out.  I try make sure i have a pipe and
some tabacco nearby all the time.  Usually i just keep it in the car
when we go places, but I'd carry it with me if i thought the mood
might strike.  For instance if we were going to a nice nightclub/pub
with some light jazz or folk music (something relaxing) to have a bite
to eat, I'd probably bring it with me.  If we were going to a Mall to
go shopping I'd probably leave it in the car.  Thats just how I am.  I
think pipe smoking is for people with a seasoned mind.  I mean some
people smoke Hemp in pipes to just get High, but really as for the
Pipe Tabacco smokers i believe it is more for a long period of
relaxing, be it reading, listening to relaxing music, fishing, or just
reflecting.

Now i could be wrong on these I've only been smoking for about 1-2 months
and own 2 pipes, and have tried 5 major brand names of tabacco that i can
get locally, but then again i guess 
you wanted something from a younger aged smoker eh?

Did you mean Young as in young of mind or young of body?

> What interests me in particular is stories of how other people

My parents live 3000 miles away.  I doubt they will know, I figure probably
in about a year or so once i find the right mix & blends to suit me, and of
course by them have a humidor, pipe rack and so one, i figure I'll just let
my mom in on it slowly.  Sorta like "Oh you didn't know" type thing.  I'd
do it in such a fashion that she would know it was habit i didn't just
pickup.  I believe if you let them in on it once you start (say in the
first month while you are still trying to find the niche) they will tend to
try to push you one way or another, either for or against tabacco.  
 
> I still find it difficult to smoke with confidence in public - 
> probably because of my age.   Can anyone help me on this?

I believe its our age.  Its society in general.  If i was in the right
setting i could smoke in public comfortably, (nightclub, or relaxing side
of lake, or maybe nice pub) however i don't think I'd feel comfortable just
smoking on the side of the road or watching a parade.  That to me seems
more like a cigarette smoker.

You got me Charl.  Maybe we can run a survey.  Every send Charl the age ya
started smoking, and he can let us know the lowest, highest, mean, average,
stats for different ages etc. hehe (that is if he wants to do that :)

Hey Everybody...

Well, I haven't written in a while, and I have a few things I wanted to
mention.  First, I recently moved to San Francisco to attend law school
here at Hastings.  I have to admit I miss being able to smoke my pipe in
the peaceful, warm autumn air of Southern California, for I now have to
get used to sitting on my balcony and listening to the city traffic far
below me.  

My first question is this...  Ever since I came up here, I notice
something rather bothersome.  I'd always thought that the point of
smoking a pipe was to make it last, but with the wind we have here in
The City, I smoke on my balcony and my tobacco just burns up much more
quickly!  It's frustrating!  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how
I might extend the life of my bowlful of tobacco (without necessarily
smoking inside?)  

Second, I was curious if anyone knew whether a special cleaner,
equivalent to pipe sweetner, should be used on a Meerschaum.  

Finally, let me recommend Grant's Pipe Store, on Market Street.  I'm not
sure of the exact address, and I don't know if it's in the guide, but I
felt it just had a better feel than another nice pipe store here in the
City, Sherlock's Haven, located at 1 Embarcadero Center.  At any rate,
take care and happy smoking...

<a name="10">Subject: First time posting..</a>

Dear Steve,

I've been receiving the pipe digest for a year now and wanted to take
a minute to express my thanks to you for making this forum available!
I am a weatherman for ABC in Tyler, Texas and have thoroughly enjoyed
reading the digest.  In fact, I've noticed several times the mention
of the pipe store on Coit Road in Dallas.  I've been in the store
several times and within the past three months purchased a high grade
Mastro de Paja from them for $325.  I also have a high grade Italian
Caminetto that I purchased from another great store in the Dallas
area.. "Up In Smoke" in the Dallas Galleria.  Also in my
collection.. two gold-banded Kinsale Petersons, a couple Savinellis
and a Ser Jacopo that I also purchased from the "Up In Smoke" store in
the Valley View mall in Dallas for $175.

I just purchased on my last trip to the Galleria, a box containing 5
different tins of the Dunhill mixtures that they are offering for the
Christmas holidays.  The box contained: Dunhill My Mixture 965,
Standard Mixture Medium, Royal Yacht Mixture, Early Morning Pipe and
the Nightcap Tobacco.  My favorites.. the Early Morning Pipe and the
Nightcap.  I don't know how readily available this gift set is.. so if
you're interested in obtaining the box (around $29 I believe).. the
number for the Dallas Galleria "Up in Smoke Store" is 1-800-856-7501
or 214-458-7501.

One more thing and I'll close..  last Christmas my Aunt in Hutchinson,
Kansas gave me a round copper humidor that apparently belonged to my
Grandfather.  The only markings on it are found on the bottom and read
"Solid Copper, Hand Finish".  Inside the lid.. a drop down tin cap
that you can unscrew and put a humidifer in.  I've been using the
small "Peterson's Humidifier" that you immerse in cold water every 5-7
days.  It keeps the tobacco perfectly humidified, not to mention looks
wonderful on my pipe shelf and is definitely a "topic of conversation"
with guests.  I'm wondering if you or anyone else who reads the digest
would be able to give me a bit of history on my copper humidor.  I
can't seem to find any information on it.  It stands approximately 6-8
inches high and holds about 3/4 pound of tobacco.

Sorry for the length of this.  Just wanted to get my "first posting" in and
congratulate you on the wonderful job you're doing!  Keep up the good work!

It has been quite a good summer at flea markets this year.  Latest 
acquisition is a wooden "chest".  The fine finish oak chest, is 
9.5"l x 7.5 deep x7.5"high, has the top and front panel interlocked.  The 
top opens and the front panel is hinged so that it comes down.  From the 
front you see a 6 pipe rack with a place for pipe cleaners.  Looking 
down, you see the holes from the rack section, and a 3x8.5" wide, plastic 
lined "humidore section".  I am not sure if the humidore section is for 
pipe tobacco (it would hold a lot) or cigars.  I do not know how old it 
is, but it cleaned up very nicely.

I also picked up a natural frehand pipe with a vulcanite stem.  The pipe 
is stamped "Bruno Original", "hand made".  I am not familiar with this 
carver (?) or brand.  If anyone has any information, I would be grateful.

Regarding telling parents about pipe smoking, my mother died from 
cigaretts (lungs burst) when I was about 14.  When I was 18, I told my 
dad that I was going to start smoking pipes, and would not smoke 
cigaretts.  He said that that was fine--but stay away from cigaretts.  I 
am now 47, have never smoked cigaretts, and have contained my smoking to 
pipes and occasional cigars.

My question to the list is what is light, moderate, and heavy pipe 
smoking.  I usually smoke at least one pipe a day, up to a maximum of 
three.  Usually, I like a large pipe that will last up to an hour.  What 
are the definitions---also with respect to risk?

I am looking for an old GBD blend called "GBD International World Blend"  
If anyone knows where some can be purchased, I would be grateful.  SMoked 
it for many years until it was taken off the market.

As part of the CD rom project, I wish some of our knowledgable members 
could put together a listing (or data base) of the main pipe 
manufacturers, design or stypes of pipes, and the year of manufacturer.  
For example:

	GBD	prehistoric	sandblast or smooth	1982-1988
	GBD	New Standard	smooth			1978-1990

etc., etc.  It would also be useful to have a relative value assigned 
denoting the scarcity of the pipe.

Enough ramblines, but, will pipe smokers rule the world if they quit 
making matches and have to use lighters??? :-)

1996) issue of "Pipes and Tobaccos" magazine. It states: "According to
a study of U.S. veterans (cited by the surgeon general as the most
detailed report on the effects of various forms of tobacco use), pipe
smokers have a mortality risk ratio of 1.07 compared to nonsmokers. In
other terms, the death rate of pipe smokers is about 7 percent higher
than that of nonsmokers. And pipe smokers who consumed four or fewer
daily bowls had 0.07 lower risk than nonsmokers."

The article also quotes a 1988 study by by Herling and Kozlowski:
"...pipe or cigar smoking may be a reasonable alternative to
cigarettes, if not inhaled and kept under five a day."  (It's doubtful
they'd get funding now. :-/

Hi folks.  This is my first entry into your digest.  I have read many
articles about and by young pipe smokers, and decided to ad my twopence.  
I started smoking a pipe when I found my dads old DR. Grabow in the trash.
Of course I grabbed it, ran out and bought a pouch of Borkum Riff (I was 17
by the way) and lit up.  Not having any advice to draw on, i failed
miserably.  I did keep the pipe, however, and tried again every once in a
while.  I even bought my own pipe, another dr grabow, and kept trying.  When
I was around 21, I found a pipe shop, and I was in heaven. I learned how to
smoke the right way, and I discovered the pleasures of custom blended
tobaccos.  I now own 6 pipes (no more DR. Grabbies) and even 2 tampers, a
rack, and an ash tray with one of those funny little cork things in the
middle.  So much for history.

I have been reading your newsletter for a couple of months now, and I have

I am a pipe smoker of 20 years, and perhaps a little unusual in only
smoking a single brand which I find most satisfying - Balkan
Sobranie. I don't really know any other pipe smokers personally, it is
curious to be able to correspond with you all in this way. I have
often wondered to myself "Who are these other people buying the same
tobacco I find so enjoyable?"  (As my tobacconist assures me it is
quite popular).  I would be pleased to hear from anyone who shares my
taste.

Now for the sad part .... I was told recently that I would no longer be able to
obtain this blend, it had been discontinued. Does anyone know if this is true?
Can anyone suggest an alternative supplier in the US or elsewhere who may be
able to help me?

I know there are many other choices out there, and perhaps I should be more
adventurous, I have tried many brands over the years but never get the same
enjoyment I find with Balkan Sobranie. As you can imagine, this news was
devastating on the same scale as hurricane Fran - which arrived at about the
same time.

If PD can help me here, I will instantly become a lifetime member.

in GRAND OPAL CIGAR CO. may be brought across to all these fine members...

Fellow Aficionados!
Though across the Ocean from the Cigar boom, us in Europe are slowly
catching on and jumping on the wave and discovering the true pleasures
and appreciation of fine, premium handmade cigars and other fresh tobacco
products and its accessories. As per date the selections of great cigars
in Norway and Scandinavia has been limited and ruled by the big companies
providing poor, artificially added, mass manufactured and poorly stored
 ( actually dried out! Shuld I rather say ) Cigars, available in few areas
 ( although things are changing...and there are infact a couple of stores
out there ...)....
Having travelled the States and been around in the world I have been able
to luckily get my hands on some fantastic stogies over time ( although
all too rare )! Well, getting to the point,  I ( and a few great beings )
have now established GRAND OPAL CIGAR CO. in Norway, with a direct
philosophy to distribute and sell premium cigars and related tobacco
products and accessories( and yes that does include Pipes and the great
variations in Pipe tobaccos ) on the Scandinavian market, and Europe to follow!
In the process is the opening of an exclusive Cigar store, along with a
Club and Lounge and the "goodies". About time one say? Of course!
As a steady reader of the Digest I felt that...why don't we ask the opinions
of the other members? So I ASK YOU....send me an e-mail....about
whatever you must feel....WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE US TO DISTRIBUTE? WHAT
ATTRACTS YOU? WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE BRAND/TYPE? Do you have any good ideas
lurking
in the back?! And should you be in the close- by area
I urge you to get in touch....give us a call....whatever you feel.....We are
open to all ideas and thoughts anybody might have relating to the above.

So, Steve...if you want you may add us on to your list....and I'll update on
the opening dates and place later! Thanks a bunch!

Sincerely

First I want to thank you Steve for taking on this task. You must really
love doing this, and I am very happy for you in that respect. I also want to
encourage all of those young (under 30) pipe and cigar smokers out there. I
have been smoking pipes and cigars for 13 years and I am 31. I know exactly
what these young people are going through. In fact, I still go through it
quite a bit. Even though I am a professor at the University of Mississippi,
I am constantly mistaken for a student and I still get strange looks when I
have a pipe or cigar in public ( which is not too often). Just enjoy this
fine past time and remember that you will probably out live most of your
curious on lookers anyway.

I would also like to respond to Jason Sarsany's query about building a
humidor, and for anyoneelse interested in this subject. In the December 1995
issue of of Popular Mechanics is a humidor shop project. It has good
directions, a measured drawing, and a materials list. This one is made out
of mahogany and holds up to 50 cigars. I personally have not had time to
make this yet (bought my own "This Old House" project taking all free time)
but I will eventually. I hope this helps.

<a name="23">Subject: Pipe Digest</a>

          I saw the item "Pipe: Questions & Answers" on Smokin' Joe's home 
          page.  I would be very interested in subscribing, and would be 
          grateful if you could tell me how to go about it.
          
          I've been a pipe smoker for 30 years.  In the early 1970s I 
          purchased four GBD New Standard pipes, and I also purchased a 
          good second.  I've replaced the stems on three of them, but they 
          continue to smoke very well.  I also have a couple of Canadians 
          and an apple Comoy's Patina, all purchased in the early 1970s.
          
          It is worth noting that none of these pipes came with a filter, 
          and I haven't given the matter much thought, as I hadn't 
          purchased any pipes since then.  However, on a recent trip to 
          England, I purchased five pipes:  two from Inderwick's, one from 
          Shervington's, and two Dutch Big Bens.  All of them had filters 
          of one sort or another:  the Inderwick's have a disposable 
          filter, while the others have metal filters.  A couple of 
          knowledgeable pipe smokers told me that if I don't like filters 
          (and I don't!!), I should just remove them.  This is what I have 
          done, and they seem to smoke very well.  However (getting 
          philosophical, while pipe smokers seem to be pragmatic!) I wonder 
          if I am not, in a sense, compromising the design integrity of the 
          pipe by removing the filter, in that the interior of the pipe had 
          to be crafted to accommodate the filter.  Or are filters truly 
          optional, and not an essential element of the pipe?  What is in 
          the mind of the designers/craftsmen when they decide whether or 
          not to include a filter?  Sorry to have gone on a bit, but it's 
          hard to get information on a topic like this!! 
          
          If you have any views on filters, I would be grateful to hear 
          them.  Also, I would be grateful if you could share the views of 
          some of your subscribers on this matter, or any articles that 
          have appeared in Pipe Digest.
          
          Hoping to hear from you!  

[ Personally, I don't have any filter pipes, but might not be averse
to trying one of the balsa filters that are popular in Germany.  The
American tubular filters I'd think would gum up quickly. -S. ]

<a name="24">Subject: Tinned Tobacco</a>

Hello Steve and Fellowship Pipesters,

   First of all, Steve keep up the great work on the Digest. I look forward
to receiving it everytime.

   Now to my questions. 
    1) I am relatively new to pipe smoking (1 1/2 years) and just bought my
first tin. I have always smoked house blends packaged in zip lock bags. I
was wondering if there is anything special I should be doing about
humidification. How should I store the tin? It will take me a long time to
finish this amount.
    2) The tin I bought is Mac Baren - Symphony. My tobacconist recommended
it to me based on the house blends that I liked. I would like to know of any
other tinned tobaccos that are similar to try. I would like to try and
branch out but in the relative same direction.
    3) Can anybody give me any info about Sierra pipes sold at Tinder Box?
This was the first pipe I bought and I really enjoy it. I recently bought a
Sasieni Four Dot for about twice the price. No matter how much I smoke the
Sasieni, I always like the Sierra better. I figured the more money spent,
the better smoke but now I am wondering about this theory.

   Thanks again for the Digest and any info you or other members can offer.

       Al Eckstein
      
[ Re the tin: When it gets dry, just run your hand under the faucet
and sprinkle some water from your fingers onto the tobacco.  The same
procedure works fine for bags. 

In the MacBaren line, I'd recommend "Plumcake" and "Golden Extra."
Also try some McConnell "Red Virginia," "Scottish Blend," and "Black
and Gold."  Maybe go for some flake tobaccos once you've gone through
these. 

Gee, I've been editing this issue for two hours and haven't even lit
up yet?  No wonder it's taking me so long! :-) -S. ]

<a name="25">Subject: You Don't Have to Spend a Fortune for a Great Smoking Pipe...</a>

Steve, in building my pipe collection, I have learned that there are
some affordable, great smoking pipes and lots of expensive, great
looking pipes that may or may not be great smoking pipes.  Bottom
line: you don't have to spend +$100 for a great smoking pipe, but you
will have to spend +$100 for a great looking pipe.

I have my share of nice pipes and my favorite pipe is a dark Ashton
sandblast billiard. It is beautifully made and I just love to hold it,
look at it, and of course, smoke it.  But this particular pipe also
happens to be one of the hotter smoking pipes that I own, so I have to
be careful as to what I smoke in it and how I smoke the pipe.  Several
myths are smashed here: a) sandblasts smoke cooler than smooths, b)
relatively expensive English pipes have excellent smoking qualities,
and c) the "best" pipe is the pipe that smokes "best."

On the other end of the spectrum, one of the cheapest pipes I own, a
sandblasted Carey Classic "Magic Inch" billiard, cost me $24 and
honestly, this inexpensive pipe is one of the coolest and best smoking
pipes I own.  Asthetically, the pipe reflects its low-cost heritage;
its cheaply-finished bowl and cheesy plastic bit won't impress anyone.
Yet, I often find myself turning to this pipe when I really want to
SMOKE.  So, I can highly recommend the purchase of a Carey Classic
"Magic Inch" sandblast to anyone who seeks a pipe with great smoking
characteristics, at any price.  This is simply a great beginner's AND
expert's pipe! I have also found several other inexpensive pipes that
smoke very well including a $29 Brebbia bent sandblast and a $28
Sasieni 4-dot ruff-root horn.  So, rest assured: there are some great
smoking pipes out there that don't cost an arm and a leg.
  
Seek and ye shall find!!

<a name="26">Subject: My tastes vs. traditional collecting</a>

Hi all,

	I've been smoking Pipes for about a year now, and have a small
collection of Stanwell Briar Pipes.  Not that the name Stanwell should
impress anyone (more on that later), but I'm just letting you know
about my tastes.

	I REALLY liked the Stanwell pipes which were being sold in my area last
year.  I liked the fact that Stanwells weren't huge pipes yet they had
"oversized" bowls which were very round and buddah like in appearance.  All
of the other pipes I saw looked so long and large that they didn't appeal
to me at all.  Perhaps the overall stoutness of a Stanwell is what makes
the bowl appear so large and distinctive.  Another reason for my having
amassed a small Stanwell collection (aside from the fact that their
appearance appealed to me) was that their prices allowed me to purchase
many; that I might allow a recently smoked pipe to rest 5 days while still
able to enjoy other pipes which had been rested. 

	In their "Legend" (light natural color) style finish I've so
far collected a pug, a large and round bowled bent, and a very large
and round bowled well.  In their "Colonial" (very dark color) finish
I've collected a large round bowled bent and I also have 3 pipes (1
canadian, and 2 bents) from their new "Buffalo" collection which have
a hallmark piece of bamboo forming the shank.

	Alas, the local pipe shop which was carrying the large selection of
Stanwells now offers only a few choices from Stanwell (6 pipes in an
unappealing reddish color), and a rather large selection of $20 pipes
(small very thin bowled) which I cannot identify because they do not have a
name carved or stamped into the wood.  The proprietor hinted that the
booming popularity in cigars has caused him to neglect his pipe stock.

	Perhaps this is a sign that I should take up "real" pipe
collecting?  The names I usually hear mentioned in the context of
collecting are Peterson's, GBD, Dunhill, and Savinelli, and I believe
that all of these makers price their pipes above $200.

	Some questions I have along the lines of collecting are:  Should I be
ashamed of having more than one Stanwell?  Do those other brands smoke
better than Stanwell?  Would I smoke (taste, touch or smell) a $130 to $200
difference in those other pipe makers pipe's over any in my Stanwell
collection?  Or is the price difference simply due to the fact that the
other pipe makers make bigger pipes, and thus use more briar which (the
high price of good briar) drives up the price?

Thank you, and I look forward to your replies.

Eric.

[ If so, I should be ashamed; I think I have three. -S. ]

Hiya Steve 

Enjoyed the latest issue (#224) immensely.....and as I am a collector
of Dunhills and the occasional Ashton--Upshall--and Comoy Blue
Riband------I have quite a question for some of the readers who may be
collectors of Kaywoodies.....:)

I recently attended an estate sale here in Pineville,
Louisiana-----and picked up a Kaywoodie Super Grain---unsmoked...in
it's original box with glove and brochure. I figger the pipe dates to
around 1948---because of the dating on the box--and some simple
addition from info included in the brochure.  Anyone know what it
might be worth ???  Still has the original wax buffed on the
pipe----it is very PRISTINE---but is it rare and a worthy collectable
??

I also have one that is smoked.......and another pipe--that has very
miniscule nomenclature----but with what appears to be a Dunhill
stem---with plumbing !!! The pipe is carved----and it very well could
be an early Vernon Dunhill fitment pipe.  Anyone got any answers for
me...email me at ?????????????????????

Thanks Steve for the pleasure you provide through the PD

From: "Spencer M. Schein" <???????????????????>

Dear Steve,

I'd like to know if any of the subscribers have experience with the 
La Fuma line of Ser Jacopos.  A while ago I showed my local 
tobacconist,  Joe Nastri of Trinity East (215 Sunrise Highway, 
Rockville Centre, NY 11570, (516) 678-1822) the Dan Pipe catalog 
another subscriber from Germany had been kind enough to send me. The 
La Fumas looked spectacular.  Joe had never seen that line of 
Jacopos, though he carried Jacopo's and had a number to show me. He 
checked with the importer by phone, while I was in the shop - this 
gentleman provides superb service! - and was told that the La Fuma 
line was the way Ser Jacopo marketed seconds. I told Joe I found it 
hard to believe, given the appearance of the pipes in the catalog, 
their high prices, and the silver work that some of them had lavished 
on them.  He said he would ask the importer to drop off a couple if 
he had any, so I could see them.

Last week when I stopped by Trinity East to pick up a repair - Mark
Tinsky does a lot of their repair work - Joe was very pleased to show
me a La Fuma.  It was no second. It was a beautiful, straight-grain
virgin, fairly large (the wood is about 1/2" thick around the top of
the bowl, in a squat dublin shape with a slightly curved stem. Joe
said he had gotten two from the importer, but the other one was small,
and he knew I favor larger pipes, and had sold it.  This one was
priced at $150. To my eyes it looked better than some of the other Ser
Jacopo's he had costing hundreds more.  It has turned out to be the
finest pipe I own!  Gorgeous, though lacking fancy silver work, light,
and great smoking.

Has anyone else encountered these pipes? And by the way, I hope this 
is taken as a compliment not only to Ser Jacopo but also to Joe 
Nastri and Trinity East. As has been remarked in PD before, Joe is a 
gentleman and his service and wares are excellent. He does do mail 
order, so this may interest other PD subscribers. I just hope they 
don't get all the La Fuma's he may be getting in, if any more are 
available. I plan to be back for more.  Joe, by the way, has never 
been tempted to smoke, though he is surrounded by excellent pipes, 
tobacco and has recently added a walk-in humidor for cigars.  His 
family has been in the pipe shop business for decades, and I believe 
they once owned Barclay Rex in lower Manhattan. He is certainly the 
most knowledgable and and friendly pipe and tobacco purveyor it has 
been my pleasure to know.

Best to all,
Spencer Schein

Steve,

The one bright spot of my current assignment in the otherwise 
dreary state of California is my proximity to San Diego's Zoo and 
Wild Animal Park.  I grew up watching "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom,"
where "Jim" was often seen wrestling an alligator while Marlin Perkins
sold insurance from the safety of the Range Rover, and as a result I've 
always been addicted to zoos.  My family and I took advantage of a long 
weekend to pay a visit to the city, and I took the opportunity to 
locate another shop for the resource guide.

Captain Hunt Tobacconist
851-D W. Harbor Drive
(Seaport Village)
San Diego, CA  92101
(619) 232-2938
(800) 995-5430

Overall impression:  Fairly good pipe selection, including Dunhill, Ser
Jacopo, Savinelli (POYs and Autographs), Peterson, and Boswell.  While 
I didn't examine every pipe, the ones I did were priced at retail 
(there was one very nice Dunhill shell stacked billiard with a 
beautiful sandblast that I was interested in until I spotted the price 
tag; I love Dunhills, but I refuse to pay full retail for them <g>).  
Fair-good tobacco selection, although he does carry the good stuff.  I 
picked up a couple of tins of Esoterica Tobacciana's "Margate," and I 
spotted a tin or two of some of W.O. Larsen's limited-edition blends.  
Large, well-stocked walk-in cigar humidor.  Store is small (the humidor 
takes up half the shop) and rather cramped, but it does offer a 
marvelous view of the bay.  Smoking is encouraged in the shop.  The 
proprietor, Harry Hunt, seems like a knowledgeable fellow, although he 
wasn't free to chat much--he was alone in the shop and there was a 
fairly steady stream of traffic.

Highlight of my visit:  I *finally* bought a copy of "An Illustrated
History of Pipes."  I hadn't purchased a copy via mail order 
previously, as I wanted to actually see the book before I put down such 
the rather exorbitant asking price.  It is a terrific volume, and the 
artwork/photography is striking.  I highly recommend it for any pipe 
smoker's library.

This was the only tobacconist I was able to visit this trip.  If anyone
else has any recommendations in the San Diego area I'd love to hear
about them.

Maybe this ad is not according to Digest-rules but here goes:
I am looking for a stand up pipe (poker type) for which I will
pay with "The ABC about Collecting" by Sir James Yoxall, London 1910.
There is a lot about furniture, paintings, drawings, china, etc.
+ a lot of "philosophical" thoughts about collecting in general.

The book is in pretty good condition, contains photos and drawings
and has an exlibris from a Danish noble family - the Rewentlow's.
I picked it up for "nothing" and I am not looking for a Dunhill,
an Upshall or anything that expensive - just a good stand up poker
pipe, preferably slightly bent in matt or polished finish and in
good condition. However, other items will be considered.

Sincerly,

Quote of the Week:

	"According to a study of U.S. veterans (cited by the surgeon general
	as the most detailed report on the effects of various forms of tobacco
	use), pipe smokers have a mortality risk ratio of 1.07 compared to
	nonsmokers. In other terms, the death rate of pipe smokers is about 7
	percent higher than that of nonsmokers. And pipe smokers who consumed
	four or fewer daily bowls had 0.07 lower risk than nonsmokers."

It's Election Week in the U.S.  Quite frankly, it hasn't been much of
an election.  Nonetheless, it's a better choice than a lot of the
world gets, and I hope you will take a few minutes to exercise your
power of choice. 

Please, vote for whomever you will, and for whatever reasons you
choose.  But since you are receiving this list, it is likely that you
are someone who enjoys fine tobacco in moderation.  Before you cast
your ballot, I would therefore encourage you to evaluate the
candidates in that context, and to ask yourself one question:



	 Are you more free now than you were four years ago?



					Smoke in peace,

Steve, 

[ Administrativa deleted. -S. ]

Now to the meat..
   I have been a subscriber for about a year or so now, and have up to
this point been a cigar smoker.  With the prices and availability, as
well as the love you all seem to have for them, I have decided to try
pipes.  I have purchased a used Petersen.  Most people I've talked to
says If I like Cigars, get an English or Virginian blend.  I've got a
tobak called "Old English" from my local tobacconist, it smells like
burnt wood, but no TATSE?!  I expected a bold robust taste much like a
good Honduran cigar!  Now to problem number TWO:  My pipe will not stay
lit, and I get very little smoke, I puff and puff and puff, but the
damned thing just goes out.  I'm used to a large, full cloud of smoke
form my cigars, I hardly get anything unless I'm holding a match right
over the bowl.  I don't want to give up..some help??

[ Congrats on the new pipe, Ron!  I think the two problems may be
related: you haven't got the pipe well lit, and aren't getting much
taste. 

First, make sure the bowl is packed so the draw is _slightly_ harder
than the unloaded pipe.  You may need to rub the tobacco out before
you pack it, if it's stuck together in large clumps or flakes. I've
recently heard a good mnemonic for packing. Pack three pinches: the
first pinch like a baby, the second like a boy, and the third like a
man.

Then light once, making circles with the match around the edges of the
bowl as you puff. Finally, tamp the tobacco down and repeat the
process.  The object is to get a fine white ash over the entire top of
the tobacco.  

And don't give up; it takes practice.  Maybe your tobacconist could
have a look while you light up, and see what you're missing.

If you get the bowl lit right, and you still can't taste anything,
consider switching to perhaps a cigar-leaf tobacco or a stronger
English blend. BTW, I've had the same thing with cigars; don't really
care for the milder ones on the few occasions I smoke them. -S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: First post to the digest</a>

Dear Sir,

I would like to submit my first post to the pipe digest, as a manner of
introduction.  All in all, I have found it wonderful reading.

I've been smoking a pipe for only a matter of months.  I discovered
pipes one day when the tobaco shop that I buy my cigars from was out of
my favorite Cubans.  Oh, by the way, I'm Canadian, so no laws were
broken.  Anyway, I decided, on the spur of the moment, to purchase a
pipe.  On the recomendation of the saleswoman, I bought a Brigham.  Now,
I must say that I was impressed with this pipe before I lit it up for
the first time.  So far, my choice in tobaco has been limited to a Dutch
blend that is popular around here, Sail.  I have no idea where it ranks
on the greater scheme of greater tobacos.  My father smoked it, so I
thought that was a good one to try for starters.

The only mishap that I have had is getting a filter stuck in the pipe.  
This was mostly through my shear ignorance of the how to's of my pipe. 
It uses a maple tube, and I don't actualy see how it filters anything. 
Anyway, it got stuck, because it swelled up from the moisture of my
mouth.  This also softened the wood.  You can guess what happened when I
tried to remove it.  Most of it stayed in the pipe.  Anyway, Brigham is
going to replace the pipe, free of charge, so there is something good to
say about a lifetime waranty.  It's just the wait.

As for myself, I'm a 23 year old engineering student, so I guess the
pipe fits the immage.  The only discouraging remarks that I have ever
got from my pipe and my age are from those my own age who smoke coffin
nails (cigarettes).  Older folks have nothing but praise for my
willingness to do something that is generally considered "old".  

If anyone has any tips on tamping the bowl, or suggestions on blends to
try, please feel free to e-mail me.  I enjoy the hobby, and I want to
learn all that I can.

Thank you.

<a name="3">Subject: A few questions</a>

I have a few questions I would like to ask you, and or the list.

First, I was wondering if I could get a copy of all the people on the
list with a .jp address.  I would like to start up a club here in Japan,
and it seems like the easiest way to contact.  I am not selling
anything, and will not be giving the addresses to anyone else.  Is that
a fair use of the address list?  For all I know though, I am the only
person on the list in Japan.

Second, on a trip to the Philippines, my Colibri(sp?) pipe lighter was
accidentally dropped into the Ocean.  Saltwater seems to have affected
it poorly, and I would really like to get it repaired/cleaned.  Is there
a way I can fix it myself, or do I need to send it in.  And if I need to
send it in, does anyone have a contact address in Japan, seeing as it is
a Japanese company?

are corroded, it may bot be repairable, but you can certainly send it

From: Rob Anderson <?????????????????>
<a name="4">Subject: Another new guy</a>

[this is for the pipes digest]

As both a new member of this list and a beginning pipe smoker, I'd just 
like to say "Hi" to everyone here.

I live in Japan and that makes it quite difficult to get any info on pipe 
smoking because of the language barrier and the fact that I live in the 
middle of nowhere. I bought my pipe here (I only have one), but the 
tobacco and everything else via mail order, so it's been trial and error 
over the past few months to get anywhere.

As someone mentioned in one of the previous digests (I've been reading 
them on the web), it seems I need to be _shown_ what to do to really 
accomplish anything. This is most likely true, but any help other members 
of this list can offer would be greatly appreciated.

My first few questions are these:

Why does the tobacco in my pipe not burn evenly? I often find that only 
the middle burns completely? Am I drawing on it too strongly, packing the 
tobacco incorrectly, or something else I can't imagine?

This may sound strange, but how often and how much should I puff? And if 
the pipe (it's a briar) is hot, but not so much that I can't handle it, 
is that normal?

I've seen some mention of filters, but I can't seem to find one in my 
pipe (at least not something I'd recognize as a filter). What exactly do 
they look like? What are the adv/disadvantages of using one?

That's it for now. I know I probably sound like a total ninny here, but I 
really want to know how to proceed. The occasional time I can actually 
get my pipe lit and continue to smoke "normally" for a short span of time 
makes me want to be able to do it consistently, and so prompts the 
questions.

Have a good one,

Rob Anderson <?????????????????>

[ Sounds like you might be lighting incorrectly, Rob.  Try making
circles around the bowl with the match.  Puffing frequency should be
somewhere between oops-it's-out ant ouch-it's hot :-)  And re filters,
generally they're either cylinders or triangular prisms.  I haven't
used them myself, so I'll let others speak to their advantages and
disadvantages. -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest: Japanese club forming</a>

Morning, Steve,

Thanks for copying me an e-mail from Mr. Drapp.  Incidentally,
I was just starting to get in touch with another Japanese pipe
smoker on-line, Mr. Seiichi Namba (I don't think he's on the
PD, but contributes to a.s.p. from time to time), after seeing
his posting to the fj.rec.smoking (in Japanese) asking about
fellow pipe smokers.  Mr. Namba, although I have yet to see
him in person, has some twenty or so years of pipe smoking
experience, and is very fond of English style blends.  (He is
also very active in the Linux on-line community here).  The
initial motive of my getting in touch with Namba-san is to
look for the possibility of establishing a mailing list of/for
pipe smokers here, something very similar to PD, in the
Japanese language.

And through Mr. Tarler of C&D, I've started to correspond with
Mr. James Baldwin, Craig's customer in Japan and a college
lecturer of American origin living in Japan.  With Jim, I'm
planning a get-together some time in late this year or early
next year, since he's currently busy occupied by the idiotic
Japanese bureaucracy <g>.

Probably Mr. Drapp can join us somewhere in this scheme of
things (Ah, BTW, does he smoke pipe as well?  We have very few
native cigar smokers in Japan).  The pipe smokers in Japan
are, as Namba-san once wrote to me, an endangered spieces,
with very little info and high pricing of both tobaccos and
pipes.  I'll write directly to Andrew-san, and I promise to
follow up on the future development back to you personally and
probably on to the PD as well.

Regards,

From: Tony Casciato <??????????????????????>
<a name="6">Subject: [Pipes] Personal Update</a>

Steve,

I first read your Pipes Digest in March 1996 and sent my first letter at the
beginning of April.  I read just about every back issue available on the web
page as well as every new issue as it comes out.  This just goes to show you
that my now being 61 years old has made me smarter.  The digest just keeps
getting better.

At that time I was just starting to smoke my unused (for eight years) pipes
and trying to decide on a tobacco.  Once I tried Balkan Sobranie #759 I was
hooked.  I finally realized I had been trying very bland or mild tobaccos in
the hopes of not being overwhelmed - wrong tactic.  Of course Balkan
Sobranie is no loger being imported but I have managed to obtain several
cans.  It can still be found if you look around hard enough.  I have also
been told that it will again be available from another supplier under the
name Balkan Sasieni.  Don't know about that for sure but it will be
interesting to watch for it.

I also plan to call Craig of C&D to see what recommendations he may have for
other tobaccos now that I have a good starting point concerning what I like.

In my first letter I mentioned visiting         W.Curtis Draper
                                                640  14th Street, N.W
                                                Washington, D.C.  2005
                                                (202) 638-2555
                                                (800) 572-2382

in early April and being very impressed.  I have since done mail order
business with them as well as revisiting in person and I am even more
impressed.  At the end of April, I talked on the phone with John (Duke) Fox.
I explained that I was looking for a meerschaum pipe and possibly a briar
pipe.  After a few minutes talking about what I had in mind, he recommended
a couple of pipes.  He said he would be glad to send one or more pipes to me
and I could return any or all of them if not satisfied.  As it turned out, I
ordered a Ural Meerschaum lattice bulldog and a Savinelli smooth finish bent
bulldog. They came within two days and I kept them both.  In July I ordered
a Ural Meerschaum lattice bent bulldog and a couple of corn cob pipes, all
of which met my expectations.

In August I was at the 1996 Doll & Teddy Bear Expo in D.C. with my wife.
That Saturday afternoon, when Lorraine was ready to rest a bit, I took a
mile and a half walk in 95 degree heat to visit the shop in person and met
Duke face to face.  We talked quite a bit and I bought a Ural Meerschaum
lattice calabash shape pipe as well as several accessories.  I walked the
mile and a half (all uphill) back to the hotel in a very good mood.  I
heartily recommend dealing with W.Curtis Draper.

In my first letter I mentioned that my Savinelli lighter lit the first time
I tried it after sitting unused for eight years.  I find that it doesn't
matter because I now use wooden matches almost exclusively; the kind that
can be bought in most supermarkets.  In fact, the ones I am now useing are
Diamond Red Top safety matches that were also sitting unused for eight years.

I have now read three issues of Pipes and Tobacco Magazine and four issues
of Pipe Friendly and will continue to subscribe as long as they publish.
They are both worth the money and the time to read.

Revisiting my long unused pipes was a very smart move.  I have spent many
relaxing hours in the den or on the back porch with pipe in hand.  It will
get even better when I retire at the end of April next year.

Here I am. Italian, 39, married with three kids (the fourth due next
Saturday), etc etc :-)

I have been enjoying Balkan Sobranie ever since the age of 20. I have been
on and off my pipe since, but I distinctly recall when I fell in love,
instantly and irrevocably, with the scent of Latakia that came out of the
pipe of one of my disciples (I used to teach sailing then). I learned it was
this "Balkan Sobranie Black" (the 759), and I have smoked nothing else for a
long time.

I have broadened my choice by now but Latakia mixtures still remain my
favourites. Latakia is the type of tobacco that gives B.S. its smokey
flavour; you find it in other mixtures such as Dunhill's Standard Mixture or
965, to name a couple. It is true that B.S. will soon be no longer available
in the US, but most mail-order tobacconists sell mixtures that closely
resemble it (try Cornell & Diehl, start from the PD homepage).

In the last digest, a new member mourned the demise of the Balkan Sobranie;
he should know that a new company has revived it. Called, I believe,
"Balkan," it comes in the familiar black-and-white package and, on one
smoking, appears to be faithful to the original. I can get details if
anyone is interested (or if this isn't very old news by now).

[ I quite agree, Nathan, that tobacco is a drug.  The problem is that
the director of the FDA is not acting out of some sense of academic
pedantry, but rather to extend the domain he controls.  The term
"drug" is also perjorative (though it shouldn't be; aspirin is also a
drug.)

We shouldn't lie for our cause, true -- but neither should we trust
men of unlimited ambition. -S. ]

Well, Steve, not too sure what you think is pedantic about being
consistent.  One would have to work long and hard to force me to give up my
tobacco use, just as one would have to work long and hard to force me to
support the California Attorney General when he sends tactical squads to
bust marijuana smokers/growers or questions what goes on in the privacy of
my house. Men of unlimited ambition come to power on the backs of citizens
of limited intelligence.  We, smokers, should be the first to defend the
responsibly acquited rights of others. 

Nathan (Jazz lover, motorcycle rider, fool for hunting, ah, pedantic
academic and yes, smoker).

[ Easy, Nathan.  I wasn't accusing you of being pedantic.  I was just
pointing out that Mr. Kessler's motivation in classifying nicotine as
a drug is not simply consistency.  It is to control the industry, and
our hobby, using the FDA's enforcement machinery. -S. ]

I would be interested in a young pipe club.  If it ends up being that there 
are not enough of us, we might want to include young cigar smokers.  Young 
pipe clubs would probably be successful at colleges.  I will be attending 
Arizona State University next year and would like to be involved in such a 
thing.  Maybe we can make a nationwide organization with clubs at the 
colleges.  What do ya think?

This is my first response to the Digest and I have a big (?) problem...
I live in germany and enjoy pipe smoking for about 3 and a half years now.
I discovered a large variety of tobaccos and must say that it's a real
pleasure.
Since my last holiday in the U.S. I enjoy cigar smoking a lot and would like

I don't know who to send this to, so I'll just reply to the digest and hopes
it gets somewhere where others can read it.

I am responding to the inquiry about young smokers.  I am 19, and have just
started smoking and love it.  I smoke about 5 to 10 bowls daily, and I can't
get enough.  I started on some (yuck) gas-station bought Captain Black, just
to start out.  My brother got me a pipe for my birthday.  I'll try to
describe it (forgive my ignorance) It's a bent Velani pipe from italy made
with a reddish wood with an amazing finish.  I guess I'll stop trying to
describe it now, because my knowledge of the terminology is limited right
now, but it has a clear plastic tip with a thin black bit that runs inside.
THe basic point is, it smokes great.  I showed it to a local tobacconist and
he was quite impressed, so I guess I got a good piece.  
The actual point of this message is the question that was arisen about
smoking in public.  From what I read, many people were intimidated by it,
saying it ruings the effect of what pipe smoking is all about.  I disagree.
Walking around on my campus to classes, I'll load up a quarter of a bowl,
and smoke on the way to class.  Doing so enables me to really walk in my own
world.  The effect is not lost, and is, in fact, amplified by changing the
surroundings while still being in the same place in your mind.  Not only
this, but you expose those around you to this wonderful world as well.  The
aroma from my tobacco (which is currently Black Raspberry, a wonderfully
mild draw with a great aroma) is very pleasing to those around, and is quite
enjoyable for others, so I've heard.  In the 1 week that I started smoking a
pipe, I've introduced the concept to many dozens of others, and I've seen
and smelled pipes popping up all other the place.  Two people even asked me
to go with them to pick out pipes and tobacco (like I knew anything about
it.. and I made this clear to them, but they wanted me to come anyway).  
Anyway, I just felt that I should share my thoughts on the fact that public
pipe smoking is a great way to not only express yourself, but to take that
great feeling that arises from private smoking with you wherever you go.
Try it... don't worry about what people will think.  Do it because you want
to, and people will follow.

That's all I have to say.  Anyone who has questions or concerns, or just
wants to chat, email me at ???????????????

I just recently read a copy of Pipes Digest where you refered to combat
aircraft of WWII as pipes such as an ME 109 as a Mershuemshmit.  I
understand this a play on the Mesureshmitt ME109 airplane.  What was the
purpose of this?  I am assuming this was a joke.  Enlighten me....

Hi Steve,

I've just seen the Web page for the first time.  Wow!
The world sure has changed since we first started sending
you our email and you getting it back to us in digest form.

I saw and remember the treatise on tobacco growing from
Bill Thacker, did you ever make contact with him?  Is he
still around?

As you can tell, I still receive the digest, but I rarely have time
to pour through the information. 

Right now I am on the hunt.  I want to make a humidor or two. 
We've moved to Washington State and I'm getting a woodshop
shaped up. One of the projects I am itching to get to is a humidor.
I don't know much about their construction.  Do you have any
ideas where I might find the information I want?  I didn't see anything
on the web page,  but with all the links there I might have missed
something.

By the way, how is the married life treating you?  Has your wife taken up

Steve,

It's great to see Bill Thacker back on the list!  I will now wait with even 
greater anticipation for the digest looking forward to his next contribution.
I just wanted to add my two-cents on several topics from the last issue, 
and will, in the interest of length, hopefully manage to stay out of the legal
debates (for now ;) - too many personal issues to be totally objective at the 
moment).

About young smokers, I am 32, which I still consider fairly young, and came to
pipes 2 years ago when smoking cigars became a social statement (I'm not 
looking to start anything here - but you must admit that the with the 
introduction of Cigar Aficianado, a cigar was no longer just a cigar).  I get 
the occasional look or comment having to do with pipes being an "old man's 
habit", but have also received my fair share of compliments, whether it be 
about the aroma of the tobacco or the particular pipe I am smoking (and 4 out 
of 5 ladies surveyed prefer pipe smokers to cigar smokers for their men that 
do smoke).  Though I've since earned the nickname "Professor" from some of my 
co-workers, its a far cry from some of the other names they've come up with.  
As far as telling your parents, waiting until pipe smoking becomes an 
established practice for you is your best bet - "Hey Ma, remember that nervous
tick I used to have, well it's all gone now thanks to my Ser Jacopo!"

To Peter Smith who was looking for a Balkan substitute, Finck Cigar Company 
(www.finckcigarcompany.com or 1-800-221-0638) sells a substitute @ $14.25/lb. 
I haven't tried either the orginal or the copy so I can't vouch for this 
particular blend, but I have tried some of their other tobac and been quite 
pleased.

With regard to Eric Kahler's Stanwells, I have three myself and find them to 
be both great smoking pipes and a good buy.  In fact of the three, the most 
expensive (a Hans Christian Andersen sandblast at $99) is the poorest smoking 
and only because the thin bowl tends to get too hot with certain tobaccos - 
though this is countered by the churchwarden stem.

Finally, like Mark Lathem, I too found myself in San Diego this month and 
agree on his review of Captain Hunt's.  I didn't find any other tobacconists 
worth mentioning (sorry, Mark) but I did happen across the Cuban Cigar Company
on 5th Ave. in the Gaslight Section of town.  After dinner at a local brew pub
with a business associate (nothing to rave about - but there are TONS of 
restaurants on 5th, so just pick one), we took a stroll up 5th and happened 
across their shop.  They sell only their own cigars, rolled in the store, and 
have some tables facing the front of the shop where we enjoyed a fine maduro 
and a couple games of backgammon.  I know this flies in the face of my "Cigar 
Chic" comments above, but I have enjoyed a good smoke after a good meal long 
before shops like this became the rage, and this place is worth a stop if your
dining in the area.  There is similar shop directly across the street that 
also has rollers but doubles as a coffee shop that we didn't stop in.

Enough is enough.  I'll save any other thoughts for another time.  Thanks 
again Steve for giving us all a forum where we can occasionally ramble on 
about things that maybe only we find important.  So, whether it be pipe or 
cigar, please ...

Smoke in peace!

                What is the ststus of your CD efforts?  If you get it in
production I would like to purchase a couple.  One for myself and one for a
gift for the guy who brought quality pipes to my attention.

                Recently I ordered a full bent from Kirsten and have enjoyed
it very much.  It smokes very much like my two Pioneer calabash pipes, very
cool and dry and the taste is much the same.  It requires much less rest
than any of my other pipes.  Mainly I keep it in my work truck (Ma  Bell).
They haven't forbid us to smoke in our trucks yet, probably because the
management hasn't thought of it!  

                The pipe web page is a great resource.  I found NML Pipes
direct and after a few phone calls back and forth I ordered a pre-smoked
Mark Twain silver band and a pre 1922 Peterson Delux w/silver band.  Those
folks are a pleasure to do business with.  The pipes are supposed to be here
tommorrow and I am like a kid waiting for Santa.

Hello Steve and fellow pipe-lovers,

Reginald Braithwaite wrote some sentiments which I share regarding
cigaret smokers.  I think it is a shame that tobacco enjoyment was
cheapened to the degree that cigaret salespeople achieved: a fast,
throw-away form of slow and stressful death.  The cigarets of today
are designed for rapid, addictive consumption, and most people who
smoke eventually lose track of the original pleasure of smoking.  The
pleasure of the pipe (and cigar) is that they require one to sit back
and contemplate what they are doing, to be in the moment and to
evaluate and discriminate the act and the accessories of tobacco
enjoyment.  The difference between smoking a cigaret and smoking a
pipe is something like the difference between having a glass of wine
and downing a six-pack.

I certainly respect the individual rights of all people, but I also 
hope that all smokers, particularly younger smokers, eventually 
gravitate to the thinking person's pleasure of unpressured tobacco 
enjoyment.

Best to all,
John

Steve,
 
In the last Digest, Dan Croteau wrote asking about Gawith- Hoggarth
tobaccos and the Holyoke, MA address, which you apparently have listed in
your resource guide.  G&H tobaccos, I can attest based on a small
acquaintance and writings from members about them in recent OPC
newsletters, are quite different and quite wonderful.  The Holyoke address
is that of Bob Lynch, who has been the sole importer of G&H tobaccos into
the U.S.  All that has changed recently.  Following is the piece I wrote
for the last copy of our newsletter.  If any of your readers have answers
to the questions I raise, I would be most interested in hearing from them.
 
GAWITH & HOGGARTH TO DISCONTINUE TOBACCO IMPORTING TO THE U.S.
 
The increasing number of U.S. Gawith & Hoggarth tobacco fans have been
extremely disappointed to learn that the company is discontinuing U.S.
distribution.  On July 13, Bob Lynch, G&H's U.S. agent, wrote to his
customers that "Because of the ever- increasing cost of their insurance
liability premiums on tobacco products sent to the U.S.A., the Gawith,
Hoggarth Co. of England has decided to discontinue the export of its
tobaccos to North America.  John Gawith regrets that his withdrawal from
the U.S. market will have to be a total withdrawal; therefore, he will not
honor any individual orders from customers."
 
I wrote to Bob Lynch requesting more details, and he responded on Aug., 14
that "I'm afraid I have no more to add....Gawith thanked me for 'my
sympathetic understanding of the problems he has in supplying tobacco to
the USA,' and that even if he were to supply small quantities to customers
directly, he 'would be exposed to the risks of litigation.'  The USA
business was not profitable enough for him (after paying his insurance
premiums) to take the risks.  However, this is not necessarily the case for
other companies doing a bigger business in the USA."
 
I confess I don't understand this very well, especially the insurance
premiums problem and the risks of litigation.  I will attempt to keep
pursuing the story, but I would be most grateful for input from readers who
have experience in the insurance and import duty areas--or information
about them--and could help enlighten all of us.

If you've got one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you've got more than
one, you're a pipe collector.

From: "James D. Beard" <??????????????????????>
<a name="19">Subject: GH&C Tobaccos, Etc</a>

Gawith, Hoggarth and Company have discontinued export of tobacco to North
America.  The cost of liability insurance, and other increasing expenses,
is the justification cited.

Cost of liability insurance brings to mind a few other things germane to
use of tobacco.  First, anti-tobacco zealots go back at least as far as
King James, if not well before that, and the health hazard or lack of it
has never been of any great relevance.  All association of tobacco use
with adverse health effects is just that -- an association, established by
use (or misuse) of statistics, and I would commend you to contemplation of
Disraeli's categorization of the three types of lies:  lies, damned lies,
and statistics.

Put bluntly -- and the recent finding (if true) that benzo(a)pyrene found
in tobacco binds to a location in DNA that, if mutated, is associated with
lung cancer notwithstanding -- no one has ever scientifically proven that
tobacco causes lung cancer or any of the other baneful effects ascribed to
it.  I will not claim it is harmless (I personally suspect that absorption
of nicotine and other substances in tobacco may have pernicious effects on
foetus and children not yet physically mature, and inhaling smoke cannot
be good for lung tissue), but I will assert that it does have beneficial
effects that, for me, outweigh any harm it may cause. 

Further, in my younger days, I did argue with anti-tobacco zealots on
occasion, and on more than one occasion needled them about seeking a
complete ban on tobacco when pipe smoking had not been condemned even by
the Surgeon General.  Their response, on not one but several occasions
quite separate in time, place, and zealots involved, was that pipe smoking
was minor stuff, to be mopped up after the main task (cigarettes) had been
taken care of.  After all, very few smoked pipes, and the pipe had already
been banned from airplanes, trains, most restaurants and a host of other
public areas.  If cigarette smoking could be suppressed, pipe smoking would
quickly and easily be extinguished.

<a name="20">Subject: Legalizit!</a>

Hello everyone.   I began smoking a briar only a few months ago and
every time I pick up a piece of literature about pipe or cigar smoking, I
can't escape the legal issue surrounding the tobacco industry and the
possibility of banning it. Now I am no expert in this area but I am a
person, and that entitles me to two things - the first of which I am
sitting on as I type this letter and the second is an opinion which I am
expressing right now.  I hope I don't step on too many toes with this
because this is a delicate issue which will only be debated and never
settled, regardless of legislation.
	I am a Psych major here at UE and I have read quite a bit of
literature on the subject of substance abuse.  In fact I just sat in on a
lecture from a visiting professor from Venezuela on this very issue this
afternoon. If we were to make tobacco illegal, who would really be
affected?  Cigarette smoking is very habit forming and can easily become
addicting.  The action of smoking a cigarette lasts about ten minutes and
is very labor free (meaning you don't have to sit down pack a bowl etc. 
etc) compared with pipe smoking and proper cigar smoking.  In other
words it is easy to smoke a cigarette and this is a factor as to why
people become addicted so easily plus the fact that you inhale and the
nicotine causes a physical addiction.  If we make tobacco illegal, we will
have a lot of addicted cigarette smokers running around trying to find a
leaf to roll and light up.  Thus we will be creating a market for new type
illicit drug -- cigarettes.  The cigarette smokers will still get their
cigarettes, but I hardly doubt that I would ever buy an ounce of illicit
pipe tobac.  The pipe and cigar smokers would have to give up one of their
favorite pastimes.  We are the ones who would be affected most.
	My point is that what we have now is a social issue.  If we make
it illegal to smoke tobacco, we will just be turning it into a legal
issue. The way to stop cigarette smokers from committing suicide (that is
what they do every time the light up), is through changing the social
attitudes.  We have learned through Prohibition what can happen if we make
something like this illegal.  Smoking is very much enveloped into society
today and no law is going to change a person's socialization.  These
attitudes have been forming all of one's life, you can't change that
overnight with a law.  You start with an attack on the tobacco industry
and attack smokers of all ages.  It is a slow process, but what you do is
change the attitudes of an entire country.  It won't happen overnight but
if it does at least we we will have something o discuss for several years.

good and so large that he'll soon have to start calling it a magazine
instead of a newsletter.  Great work Bill!  I expecially enjoyed the Mark
Tinsky and David Jones articles.  And, thanks for mentioning our catalog;
several members have contacted us since reading it.

Dear Mr. Masticola, 
I am a VERY novice pipe smoker and was wondering what the difference between 
Rubbed out tobacco and pressed tobacco. 
                                                         Sincerly,
                                                         Justin Payne

[ Pressed tobacco is tobacco which has been compressed into cakes at
very high pressure.  The object, as Craig Tarler explained it to me,
is a "second-day soup" effect which blends the flavors together.

"Rubbing out" is the process of breaking up the big lumps that occur
in flake tobacco (and some other kinds.)  Some tobacco is also sold as
"ready-rubbed." -S. ]

<a name="30">Subject: Meerschaum Restoration & Zippo Lighters</a>

Hello Everyone!

Just checking in for a short note. I have a question that perhaps
someone could help with. Recently a friend of the family passed away and
his wife left me his pipes. Lo and behold among them is what seems to be
a nice meerschaum carved in the likeness of a turk's head. Our friend
had only dabbled in pipe smoking and the pipe has not colored well at
all and even looks a little scruffy. Anyone I could send it to to
restore? Any tips on what I could do to restore it? Anything someone
could tell me would be greatly appreciated. 

On another subject, I would like to add my name to the list of people
who would like a Pipes Digest Zippo Pipe Lighter. I have always used a
Zippo or matches to light up. I've tried other butane lighters but I
have never found one that holds up. Zippo used to sell a butane pipe
lighter made for them by someone else. I had one but it wouldn't hold
any gas. I sent it to Zippo and they repaired it but now it is a
cigarette lighter. I called Zippo and explained that I couldn't use the
lighter as it burned my thumb now and they told me they only had parts
left for cigarette lighters. They then told me to keep it and they sent
me a new brass wick lighter for free. It's nice to know there's still a
company that will treat its customers fairly.
	
One more thing. Do anybodys wives smoke pipes? I've had my wife try it
but she didn't care for it. An interesting note though. My wife has
acquired the skill for filling a pipe perfectly. I hate to say it (and
hate for her to hear it) but she fills them perfectly each time. I of
course instructed her on the art however this is definitely a case of
the student surpassing the master.( I know what your all thinking. This
guy is the epitome of laziness, having his wife fill his pipe for him,
and your right. I am sloth incarnate. However there are times when it's
inconvienent to fill a pipe, ie. driving and any other excuse I can get
away with.) By the way she is also very knowledgable about pipes: good
from bad, shapes, etc. We went into a pipe shop once and she asked the
clerk if he had any Canadians and he replied that he didn't know where
the pipes were made. She immediately informed me we were leaving. I
didn't argue.

One last thing, (I PROMISE!) Has anyone tried an Olive wood pipe? There
was a small shop selling some here in Central Florida but she has
disappeared, and I really wanted to try one. Thanks for letting me
ramble.

Hi Steve, 
  I have not written in a while but have a couple of questions for the
membership.  Like everyone else I want to thank you for the great job you do
on the digest.
  I currently own 6 Petersons and a couple of Savinellis, love them all, but
prefer the Petersons.  The Savinellis have a balsom filter that works very
well.  After 3-4 smokes you throw them away and insert a new one.  Biggest
advantage that I see is the filter keeps the pipe very dry.
  My favorite tobaccos are Mac Barens.  I really like the Dark Twist and the
Scottish Blend.  I also love Butera tobaccos even though they are pretty
expensive.  I recently bought some Boston Harbor which is very similar to the
Butera.  I bought it on line from Brookline News & Gifts.  It is more
reasonably priced than Butera.
  On a recent trip I bought several tobaccos from the duty free store in
Munich, Germany.  They were Erinmore Mixture, made in Belfast, Ireland -
Black Diamond, made in Denmark for Stanwell.  Also bought Black Luxury
blended for Stanwell. I would love to find a source in the U S for these
three.  If any one can help me out it would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Steve,
       I would like to talk a little on the subject  of clay pipes. I have
heard people make reference to a unpleasant taste from smoking a clay .
This causes me some concern , as most my customers comment on  how much
they enjoy the taste of there favourite tobaccos when smoked in a clay
pipe. There may be a simple explanation for this . In the later part of the
19th century right up until today clay pipes were mass produced, using a
slip cast moulding method. This method entails pouring  a ceramic liquid
into a plaster mould. Pipes made in this method are very inexpensive, and
loose all the flavour enhancing characteristics of a good hand rolled clay
pipe . Clay pipes are capable of absorbing and dispersing a incredible
amount of liquid.  They are also as easy to clean, as throwing them on the
coals of a fire to burn clean any residues. Long clay's such as a tavern
pipes or church warden's , can cool smoke like nothing else. The only thing
I can say bad about them is they are very fragile and when you break a well
loved clay it can be quite heart breaking. Keep up the great work. Love the
digest.

Your most humble servant , Stephen Bray Pipemaker

<a name="2">Subject: Quality tobacco for beer pocket pipe smokers </a>

I am new to your newsletter and want you to know I look forward to reading
it. It seems
that I have really lost contact with friends and contacts in the pipe world
and your newsletter helps me to re-establish my relationship so missed over
the years. I still enjoy my old and trusty pipes. While I have several old
friends (e.g. pipes) that I have had for over twenty years, my problem now
is getting good tobacco and very affordable prices. 
I have been smoking pipes for many years and my interest has always been in
tobacco blends and experimenting with developing my own mixtures.
Unfortunately as a victim of downsizing, I have found it more difficult to
afford good blends and tobaccos for blending myself. As aresult, I have had
to put aside my taste for the best and settle ( and I mean settle) for
off-the-shelve pouches. As my period of unemployment progresses, I find
myself having to settle for those low cost junk tobaccos sold in plastic
bags under generic names. Boy, do I miss the real stuff.
Here's my question..... do any of your readers know how to get good tobacco
at very reasonable prices? I have tried using the Internet to find discount
tobacco dealers but have found that when you add postage and handling you
are right back to a price that isn't too attractive. I would like to buy
tobacco by the pound or more without paying for fancy containers or cans for
really good prices. I am also willing to purchase tobaccos and blend them
myself. Any ideas or suggestions? I am sure there are other pipe smokers out
there trying to get by and still enjoy quality blends.
I would appreciate your advice and help from your readers.

Hey,
This is a great page and has been of tremendous value to me
far as researching pipes goes.  I started smoking cigars 
and loved the calming effect they had but want top move on.
I learded a lot.  Almost seems like an art form rather than a 
hobby.  I and several members of my high school debate team
have begun to smoke pipes between rounds.  This info will
be very useful to all of us.  Thanks again and the page is
top notch.

p.s. maybe after everyone gets used to the pipes I'll send a scan
of the team.  :)

<a name="6">Subject: On Death, Taxes, and Tobacco</a>

Hello, Steve,

I usually don't get too involved in the pro/con arguments regarding the   
regulation of tobacco that crop up frequently in the Digest, mainly   
because it's usually like preaching to the choir--*we* aren't the ones   
that need convincing.  However, a couple of remarks made over the last   
two issues have prompted me to respond.

First of all, I am a smoker.  I smoke 'em all-cigarettes during the day   
at work, pipes in the comfort of my living room, and cigars when the   
weather is nice.  I am not, as Jason Sarsany puts it, committing suicide   
every time I smoke a cigarette.  And quitting cigarettes never saved   
anybody's life.  I'm not a doctor, but I've read the statistics and guess   
what?  Everybody dies!!  Yes, that's right, smokers and non-smokers,   
vegetarians and meat-eaters, joggers and couch potatoes alike-we all die.   
 For some reason (that I certainly can't figure out), many of us facing   
the end of the 20th century have gotten it into our heads that modern   
medical science will somehow confer immortality upon us if only we would   
adopt a certain healthy lifestyle (no smoking, no alcohol, no fatty   
foods, plenty of exercise, etc.).  Unfortunately, that's just not true.   
 Everybody dies.

Now it's certainly possible (although by no means guaranteed) that by   
avoiding the no-nos a person could conceivably, statistically speaking,   
live longer.  Great!  That's just what I want-an extra 10 years to drool   
on myself in a geriatric hospital (and this after a lifetime of avoiding   
the great pleasures in life).  No thanks.  I will continue smoking until   
it or something else does me in-because something inevitably will, and I   
might as well enjoy myself in moderation until it does.

Whew, glad to get that off my chest.  Now on to important matters...

After smoking virtually nothing but aromatics for many years, thanks to   
the comments, reviews, and recommendations I came across in past issues   
of the Digest, about a year ago I got started on straight Virginia-based   
blends.  Most recently, I've been trying blends manufactured by Butera   
Pipe Company and Esoterica Tobacciana.  Some excellent smoking here.   
 Although these high-end blends can be a bit pricey ($8 to $10 for   
50-gram tins), they're still pretty cheap when compared to cigars.  I   
recommend these blends highly along with those manufactured by McClelland   
(both under its own label and the limited editions manufactured for Bob   
Hamlin's Pipe Collectors Club).  This is smoking at its finest.

Of course, fine tobacco deserves a fine pipe, so I've also splurged a bit   
and bought a couple of Italian pipes, also from Bob Hamlin.  The first is   
a medium-large squat bulldog made by Radice.  It's sandblasted on the   
bottom part of the bowl and smooth-grained on the top.  A very handsome   
pipe, it smokes good now and will smoke even better as time goes on.  The   
second is an Il Ceppo freehand.  This is a beautiful pipe with lovely   
grain.  It too smokes great.  My only complaint about this pipe is that   
the smoke holes in the shank and the stem don't exactly match up so I   
can't run a pipe cleaner all the way down while smoking.  I have this   
same problem with other bent pipes in my collection, so I've learned how   
to deal with it and don't let it spoil my enjoyment.  Now that autumn is   
here when pipe smoking is, in my opinion, at its best, I can look forward   
to pleasant evenings at home in my chair smoking fine tobacco in a fine   
pipe.  Ah-h-h.....

Thanks again, Steve, for all your efforts.

<a name="7">Subject: Breaking in a new pipe</a>

     Hi All,
     
     This weekend I purchased a new pipe, from Denmark. Absolutely 
     beautiful wood.
     
     I took it, and a book I am reading, to a spot by the Bay to smoke and 
     read. I have lit a bowl in a brand new pipe maybe 4 times in my life, 
     and this time I was very conscious of the experience.
     
     First, this pipe had a pre-carbonized bowl. 
     
     Anyway,  after about a third of the tobacco was smoked I noticed two 
     things that upset me:
     
        1. The rim of the bowl was beginning to get shiny - wet - looking 
     and when I wiped it clean it seemed as if I was wiping off some of the 
     varnish, or finish as the case may be. After two more bowls the rim 
     looks "dull" and the finish definitely looks like it has been rubbed 
     off. (I wiped it with my finger and my finger was "stained" redddish 
     brown, the color of the pipe's wood, but also the color of tobacco 
     resin ?!?!!)
     
        2. The edge of the rim closes to the stem is ever-so slightly 
     getting burned. I paid very close attention to the wind and the flame 
     of my lighter and at no time did the flame touch that- or any other - 
     part of the rim the whole time I broke it in.
     
     My question is this: are these things normal? Is the process of 
     breaking in a new pipe synonymous with getting the rim dirty?
     
     Is there something I am missing and can pay better attention to from 
     now on?
     
     Thanks to all,
     
     Adam.

[ The excess stain is, I believe, fairly normal; I've noticed it
myself.  The charring of the rim is probably due to holding the match
or lighter so that the flame passes over the bowl edge as you draw.
Just hold it closer to the center of the bowl (though you want to
light the edges, too.) -S. ]

Hi.

Ummmm....I get a copy of the Pipes Digest from my roommate, but I don't
see anywhere in it the address for the list...

Anyway, if you could forward this to the list at large, I'd appreciate it...

I have read the last few issues of the Pipe Digest, and one thing that I
haven't found a good answer to is how to store the tobacco -- does it want
to be in a humidor like cigars do?  (at ~70% humidity, etc).  I am assuming
it would be a bad move to mix the different tobaccos and cigars because they
would probably stomp on each other...

As of yet, we have been getting the stuff in little zip-loc bags, and I
figured that was OK for storing, but wondered if they should all be stored
in another container (i.e. a humidor).

Thanks!
Sam

[ I don't think pipe tobacco is as finicky as cigars are.  If you dry
out cigars, they tend to unravel. Pipe tobacco can be re-humidified by
adding water, a little at a time.  Run your hand under the faucet and
let it drip on from your fingers. -S. ]

          Hello Steve,

          I just finished reading the second issue of pipes digest
          that I have been sent and was prompted to write. It has only
          been about a month since I purchased my first pipe and began
          smoking "in ernest."  Back in undergraduate school I tried a
          calabash for a very short while. This, however, was a brief
          experiment.

          Originally, a friend and I went into a cigar shop out of
          curiosity more than anything else. She had just finished
          telling me a story about how Jacqueline Kennedy was
          introduced to cigars by her husband President John Kennedy.
          I thought I would try a couple and originally found a few of
          the more expensive brands, of course, to my liking. However,
          it seemed that every time we tried visiting another tobbaco
          shop we were treated in a rather arrogant manner. Perhaps
          they felt we were invading a male bastion.  Finally we found
          a small shop in a strip mall where the propritor and some of
          the other customers were friendly and helpful.  It was at
          this shop that I took up the pipe.  The owner helped me
          select a pipe (a meerschaum) and a mild tobbaco. I have
          since purchased a small Italian free form, a churchwarden
          and a Peterson second. I find I enjoy the taste of pipe
          tobbaco far more than cigars. Not to mention the fact that I
          would rapidly grow broke if I smoked the cigars I enjoy as
          much as my pipe.

          I have never seen another female pipe smoker (other than the
          friend I started with) although I am sure their must be a
          few.  I have read the thread about young pipe smokers with
          interest because it seems most of the pipe smokers I have
          met are all my dads age.  It also seems that there is almost
          no place anymore to sit back and enjoy a pipe. Is it just my
          individual experience or is there a dearth of female pipe
          smokers? Do you think the treatment we have gotten from so
          many shops is common treatment of women customers or did we
          just hit on some bad shops?

          I don't know if you have any other women on the list but I
          just wanted to speak up and introduce myself. On a last note
          I would like to try carving a pipe. I have purchased a
          "blank" or "kit" depending on what you choose to call them
          and would appreciate any advice.

[ We do indeed have several other female pipe smokers on the list;
perhaps some will get in touch with you.  I also know of at least one

<a name="11">Subject: Calabash</a>

I was a pipe smoker for about 10 years and then quit.  Now that I'm in
my late forties, I again find that I enjoy a couple of bowls of Balkan
Sobranie #759 a day (wouldn't you know that they would wait until I
returned to pipe smoking to discontinue importing it).

My question, though, deals with Calabash pipes.  My teenaged children
gave me one for my birthday and I'd like to know more about them.  Of
course, this is the pipe that Sherlock Holmes is often depicted smoking,
but does the shape really go back to the nineteenth century?  What is
the white bowl made of?  Is it ceramic or is it meerschaum or something
else entirely?  Are there special things I need to know about taking
care of this kind of pipe?  Will the gourd body rot if it stays wet? 
Are there special things I need to know about smoking a Calabash?  And
insight on this kind of pipe would be welcome.

John Hensley
If you have one pipe, you're a pipe smoker.  If you have more than one
pipe you're probably a little eccentric.

[ Carl Ehwa has a fairly detailed discussion of the history of
calabash pipes in _The Book of Pipes and Tobacco._ In brief, he gives
the credit to Dutch explorers in mid-seventeenth century South Africa
for observing the natives smoking calabash "dacca" (hemp) pipes that
were "not unlike our modern calabashes, although they were not as
refined."  The pipes were finally refined in the early 1900s and
became popular in England, Europe, and the United States.

The bowls are indeed meerschaum, and I wouldn't worry about the gourd
rotting unless you kept it in a swamp or something. -S. ]

Steve,
My compliments to you & others who have helped to further the enjoyment of
pipe smoking by establishing a network for communication where all pipe
smokers an exchange ideas and expand our knowledge of what to me is a
facinating hobby which also offers many hours of enjoyment.  

Not only do you get to own a piece of art in the form of a pipe, be it briar,
meerschaum, clay or whatever. but the additional enjoyment of sampling the
different tobacco blends offered as well.  But let's not forget the excitment
of visiting a new tobacconist while on vacation & inspecting his shop in
anticipation of finding the ideal pipe for your collection.  The friendly
discussions often held at some of these establishments.

Also, the numerous publications, both past & present offer many hours of
reading.  I could go on & on, but I'm sure most have already discovered what
I just wrote.

I'm 50 years old as of this weekend.  I've been smoking pipe for over 30
years off & on.  I began by sneeking smokes from my dad's pipe.  He always
seemed to enjoyed it so much.  However, I still smoke a few cigarettes.  As
many others will tell you,  cigarettes are so #$%&* convenient when you're in
a hurry.

Thank goodness, in my town, pipe smokers are not frowned upon as much as they
are in other areas.  Many times I've received compliments for the aroma of my
tobacco.  I do practice good ettiquette when smoking, however.

My favorite pipes are Peterson & Dunhill.  Peterson's are great for the
money, but I find Dunhill's to be rather pricey; though still a good pipe.
 My favorite tobacco blend is Esoterica Penzance, although I have many others
which I smoke from time to time, both English & aromatic.

My wife is a non-smoker, so most of my pipe smoking, especilly the English
blends are restricted to my office at home.  I install an exhaust fan so as
to decrease some the smoke.  All this to keep peace (ha).  This goes to show
that compromises can be made.

In closing, again I say keep up the good work,

November 6, 1996

Dear Steve,

Let me begin by thanking you, and your readers, for permitting me to join
you.  I have just finished reading, with much pleasure, your most recent
digest.  

In the way of a brief self-introduction, I am an attorney working on a
graduate degree in Taxation at the New York University School of Law.  I am
the father of three and husband of one (my high school sweetheart).  As a
child I recall following men smoking pipes for blocks at a time to enjoy the
fine smell of their tobaccos.  I began smoking a pipe, moderately, about
three years ago.  I own a Peterson and a GBD.  Though I have had a couple
other pipes, they have each now found their way into the hands of new
friends.

The reason for my post, as the subject line suggests, is that my wife greatly
fears the effects of smoking.  For this cause, I find myself having to smoke
during the day when I am away from home.  While in public, I have received
far more gracious comments for the pleasant aroma emitted by my pipe than I
had ever anticipated.  Unfortunately, by the time I am home the after affects
are, as is familiar to us all, a bit stale (naturally the best method of
handling this would be to refill my pipe).  In particular, my breath is
affected in a manner which is not readily squelched by any amount of mouth
wash.  My wife knows that I smoke, wishes that I did not, and rarely misses
an opportunity to call to my attention to the unseemly after effects when she
notices them.  This is a bit of a sticky subject in an otherwise beautiful
marriage.

It really would be awful if it were to come to the point where I would
actually have to choose between my pipe and my wife.

All jesting aside.  Have you, or your readers, any suggestions concerning
both the practical matter of one's breath, and, even more importantly, a
manner of possibly "endearing" her to my hobby?  Or at the least, of making
her tolerant of it?  Her concern for my health has us some way from the happy
arrangement wherein she might actually find herself filling my pipe.

I thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Matthew P. Grupp

[ If you smoke English blends, perhaps you could try some aromatic
ones.  Does anyone else have an approach that would allow Matthew to
keep both pipe and wife? -S. ]

Hi Steve, hi all,

 Some months ago, I bought both Dan Pipe's pipes of the year 1996 - made by
Ser Jacopo; one of them being a silver spigot Rhodesian La Fuma (reddish
smooth finish).It's a nice straight grain pipe, looks well, smokes well and
cost DM 298 ($ 200). It's really a nice pipe, but it is - for me - a
'second'; it has some fills made of a red, shiny, well visible material.
So, this pipe demonstrates that Ser Jacopo (contrarily to Mark Tinsky's
experience - see 'musings from the workbench') also sells filled pipes. I
don't know if this is an exception, because this is my only smooth Ser
Jacopo.

Smoke in peace,

Well, Pipes Digest is better than 1,000,000 phone calls!!
I think that Dobie's 4 Squares is now made by A&C Petersen
in Denmark. They are in the resource guide somewhere and if you
contact them they can probably tell you who imports 4 Squares
to the US.

I think the Green is an 'English' mixture with Latakia. I have
tried the Blue (virginia + oriental) and the Red (ready rubbed
virginia). The both have a slight 'dusty' flavour that should
be typical for all their tobaccos.

        Just want to share a new discovery with fellow Digesters:

        I was just in new Haven and visited The Owl Shop for the first
time.  Although they had only 3 pre-smoked pipes (my main interest), I took
advantage of my visit to buy samples of their three English (house) Blends.
"Harkness Tower," which contains NO PERIQUE was absolutely superb and I
immediately ordered a pound.  Delicious, "leathery," full and mild.  Highly
recommended.

        The pipe club serving the mid-Hudson area in upstate NY is finally
getting under way.  Although I was disappointed to receive no inquiries
following my announcement in PD, four or five of us are going to plod
ahead, have dinner together at a pipe-friendly restaurant in Poughkeepsie,
show off our favorite pipes, trade/sell, and share tobacco discoveries (I
will, of course be bringing some "Harkness Tower").  I'll send you news of
our fledgling organization in the future.

        (this paragraph may be omitted from publication) Again thanks for
letting me talk about FINE OLDE BRIARS in PD.  I've received over 30
requests for catalogs and have sold a dozen pipes as a direct result of
this exposure.  Your openness is greatly appreciated.

Hi Steve and all the other pipe lovers!

Steve, once again I must express my gratitude to you and the P.D.
You see, I have no personal friends with whom to share this hobby here in
Finland. Your work has opened totally new possibilities to get pipes and
friends through the Net. So, thank you very much for these years!

I have bought pipes mainly from three sources: firstly _Fine Old Briars_,
managed by Rob Denholtz.  Therefrom I bought a Savinelli Linea Piu smooth
bent and a Connoisseur smooth billiard (by Ed Burak).

The second source has been Mark Tinsky, _ American Smoking Pipe_. From there
I got a Dublin smooth, natural straight grain  and a half bent semi
smooth/rustic Dublin  (R-7). Both new made from well dried plateaux briar.

The third supplier from whom I have bought is Al Grosskopf in S.F. CA.  Al
also repairs and restaurates pipes, lighters etc. with love and care. From
him I got a Bonfiglioli smooth bent and a genuine Preben Holm Danish
freehand made in Copenhagen.

All of these pipes have been between 60 to 90 USD.

To those fellows, especially in Europe, who are hesitating with "to order or
not to order", I can warmly recommend these men. Rob Denholtz especially
with his used, but well cleaned and restaurated pipes and Mark Tinsky if you
are going to buy a brand new one or have your old pipe renovated. Mark even
makes a pipe just like one wants it to be!

I must say Craig Tarler in Cornell & Diehl is a wizard in blending
tobaccoes. Two latest acquaintances have been _Plantattion Evening_ and
_Pirate Kake_. The first resembles Oriental Silk but with Latakia and the
second has as much as 70% of Latakia in it. Vow!

I am in no relation to these firms but a happy customer. I just wrote this
to thank Steve plus all the others working on behalf of our brotherhood of
pipe lovers. Also I did write to encourage members especially in Europe to
take take advantage of the possibilities of the net.

Steve,

It has been much too long since I have written...rural life has its advantages,
and on-line accessibility is most certainly *not* one of them!

Anyway, here it is eleven months later, and the PD population has ballooned
quite a bit...the more the merrier, of course :-{)>

First, I would like to thank Mr. Thom France (wherever he may be) for the first
pipe I've ever gotten for my birthday (sheesh...I'm 23 mow...I suspect a good
chunk of our readers are younger than I am...)

Next, I would like to thank Mr. Bill Unger and everyone involved in making the
Ohio Pipe Show a wonderful, fun-filled experience.  In fact, I just reserved
two vacation days for next year's show!  Ohhh, yes...a special thanks to Mrs.
Gabrielle Sempf for graciously signing "her" copy of the A&M for me :-P

Finally, since I am no longer a part of the University (shhhh....) I really
shouldn't be using that word in the title of my club, which is fine with me,
since I am trying to alter the organization slightly, and, as always, I would
love to hear from any pipe smokers/ collectors in the Central Illinois area.

<a name="24">Subject: New Member Introduction</a>

Dear fellow smokers:

I have just recently joined the list and am already impressed with what
I've seen.

Please allow me to introduce myself.  I am a 25 year old seminarian
studying at the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC.  I've
been smoking pipes only for about 7 months, and cigars for over 2 years.
My favorite cigars are Arturo Funete, especially the 858.  Unfortunately,
they are difficult to obtain (as I'm sure any cigar smokers out there
know), and I'd be interested in any suggestions for any cigars of similar
price and flavor.  I began smoking pipes at the suggestion of the father
of a friend of mine in Chicago, an older gentleman who has smoked pipes
regularly since he was 17.  He owns several hundred pipes!  At his
suggestion, I purchased my first pipe, a La Strada Ultima (bent stem) and
some Brindley's Mixture tobacco.  This is still my favorite tobacco; I
like the dry, woody flavor.  I've experimented with some aromatic blends,
but don't care for them.  Unfortunately, Brindley's is also hard to come
by.  Does anyone have any suggestions for similar blends?  I now owe 3
pipes, having purchased a Hilson Bolero and received another pipe (I can't
find the make and model) as a gift.

In additions to suggestions about tobacco blends, I'd be interested in
finding out about any bars, clubs, etc. in Washington that are pipe-cigar
friendly.  I recently visited the Capital Grille, but it's a little too
pricey for my budget.  I usually just smoke alone in my room at the
seminary, but would like to find a place where I can enjoy a bowl (and
perhaps a single-malt Scotch) in the presence of other pipe smokers.

One of the things I enjoy about pipe and cigar smoking is the
old-fashioned, politcally-incorrect image of this activity.  I am
politically quite conservative, and am increasingly iritated by the
efforts of the current adminstration to supress smoking.  While the main
target is obviosuly cigarettes, it can't be long before the
puritanical Health Police go after pipes and cigars as well.

At any rate, I'm glad there's a place in cyberspace for those of us who
enjoy fine tobacco products.  Happy Smoking!

<a name="25">Subject: Humidor construction</a>

In response to Pipes Digest 226 inquiry from Norm Carpenter on making a humidor
or two...

What a wonderful time we now live in! Aside from the mad rush on my
favorite cigars, the ever elusive A. Fuente Double Chateau with a
Maduro wrapper, it appears that cigars and their accessories are
becoming main-stream items. We can now find humidors and accessories
on display at Nordstroms and gracing the covers of catalogs from
J. Petermans. For those of us who like to plane a board or two, there
are some wonderful resources now available for the creation of your
own humidor.

Popular Mechanics had a humidor in their December 1995 issue. The
plans were very easy to follow. I built a variation of this for my
first (practice) humidor. It helps if you have had some woodworking
experience, and a table saw.  The accuracy of my radial arm saw left
something to be desired. Popular mechanics had this article in their
Web Page, so you don't even have to leave the comfort of your own home
to see it. (At least it was there last February) My only variation to
the plans was to leave the interior tray unfinished. Why on earth
would you add varnish to the Spanish Cedar tray? Yuk! No finish will
touch MY cigars, thank you very much!

Another recent article was found in the July/August 1996 copy of Today's
Woodworker. This humidor had brass inlays and a beautiful veneer top. The
magazine also has full sized plans of the details. Nice touch. I just borrowed
this issue from my local tobacconists, so I haven't read it all yet, but it
looks nice.

Yet another resource is a shop called Woodcraft Supply. There is one in
Bloomington Minnesota, 612/884-3634, and they carry Spanish Cedar. They also do
a mail order business from the headquarters. I don't know the number off hand,
but I will look for it. In a recent catalog they had Humidor Kits! All the
hardware and wood needed! 

 A year ago I couldn't find any resources on home-made humidors, and now they
are coming out of the Spanish Cedar woodwork. Try some of these, and let the
members of The Digest know how they worked. Good luck. (better make at least
two, they fill up very fast)

(One word of advice: use a dust collection system and a respirator mask when
cutting Spanish Cedar as the dust is VERY irritating and may cause severe
reactions)

[ If you don't have the dust collector, wear a long-sleeved shirt and
vacuum up and shower afterward. I did this while working with red
cedar (for birdhouses), and had no problems with allergic reactions -S. ]

Steve,  Nice job with the PD and Steve, Nice job with the WEPP site

Some readers were asking about making humidors.  I recently came
across some suppliers, one that I have at my finger tips.
The Christmas addition of "The Woodworkers Store" (800 279-4441)
has plans and hardware ($4.95, $89.95) and the humidity goodies.
They might be a good place to start.  Happy woodworking!

<a name="27">Subject: Cigarettes</a>

  In PD #226 Mr. John Giunta had some thoughts about cigarettes
being 'lazy' and easy smokes. Well, I dont disagree (much) with
him but there are cigarettes and then there are cigarettes...
  I am a pipe smoker but also enjoys quite a lot of cigarettes;
hand rolled pure virginia, that is.  The taste is not far from
a good bowl of tobacco if you use the right tobacco. Thanks to
a web-friend in the US I have tried the 'Native American' rolling
tobacco which gives a very tasty smoke.
  About smoking: If you use the right paper and tobacco
you can leave the cigarette and after a few minutes the
fire has gone. This is only true if the tobacco and paper
does not contain chemicals to keep it burning like all
factory made cigs + a lot of rolling tobacco and -paper
do. The Rizzla paper sold in the US (and Denmark as well)
is OK but I have tried the same paper bought in Germany and
there was definitely added some chemicals to keep it burning.
  Another good rolling tobacco is the Danish 'Bali Shag' which
should also be available in the US. Clean, bright virginia
without chemicals.
  And I totally agree with Steve's comments to your letter:
all smokers should unite even though we don't agree about
what is the best smoke. BTW, with Mr. Giunta being a yoga
teacher: there's also a lot of 'Zen' in rolling 'the perfect
cigarette'!

<a name="28">Subject: At The Dentist</a>

[ Originally on alt.smokers.*. -S. ]

Yesterday I went to the dentist (Reba, Steinberg, and Dodd, in
Plainsboro, NJ) for a cleaning and check-up.  Matt Steinberg, my
regular dentist, was on vacation, co I got Michael Dodd for the
check-up instead.

The hygenist who cleaned my teeth noticed some stain, and asked if I
smoked cigarettes.  I replied, with some trepidation, "I drink coffee,
and smoke a pipe once in a while."

Dr. Dodd came in to give me the exam.  After some preliminary banter,
he asked "You smoke a pipe, maybe socially?"

Uh-oh, I thought.  Here it comes.  The Lecture.  Am I going to have to
change dentists?

"About one or two a day," I replied, hackles rising in preparation.

"Good!"

<HUH?>

"Gives you something to do with that chewing urge that's not eating,"
he continued.  And went on to say that, even though he was not a
smoker, he liked going into smoke shops, looking over all the Manly
Stuff, and smelling the tobak.  I just sat there, a little
dumbfounded. 

It was a _tremendous_ relief not to be treated like Typhoid Mary!
And, up to a point, actually accepted!

So, friends, if you're in Plainsboro and need a dentist, look up
Dr. Dodd. And

					Smoke in peace,

					~\U Steve.

P.S.  The final result was one deteriorated filling and one that
looked shaky.  And nothing else. :-)

Steve:

Loved your dentist story. here's another one for PD if you wish to use
it.

Took my Sheltie to the pet parlor for a grooming today. When I picked
him up the lady said that they almost didn't want to give him a bath
because the tobacco smell was so wonderful. Looks like our entire family
is into the business!

Had another one this past summer. Was eating lunch with my family in a
restaurant when the hostess came up to me and said, "I can smell that
pipe all through the restaurant."  I thought, "Here it comes!" Not so,
She added, "It smells wonderful!" 

Sometimes you win a few, I guess.

<a name="31">Subject: Tobacco growing in Europe</a>

>From today's newspaper (November 14):
The EC (i.e. 95% of Western Europe) supports tobacco growing with
1.2 billion USD annually where the anti-smoking lobby gets 18
million USD. There are 200,000 tobacco farmers, mainly in Italy,
Spain, and Greece, each growing 1 acre in average.

They get EC support according to quantity; not quality, causing the
farmers to produce low quality tobacco. This tobacco cannot be sold
the EC because of the poor quality and therefore is used for export
mainly to Eastern Europe and North Africa. The subsidies means that
the tobacco can be sold at dumping prices and probably smashing the
local markets.

This note just to show you how the EC sometimes woks.

<a name="32">Subject: snuff (nasal)</a>

Searching fruitlessly for anything about nasal tobacco snuff on the Web, I
came across a message from someone enquiring about it, but with no e-mail
address to reply to.  It turned out to be in www.pipes.org, hence my
subscribing to the Digest. I doubt my extensive lore about the history and
varieties of snuff will be of much interest to pipe smokers (or indeed
anybody else).  However I should be happy to respond to any queries if
e-mailed.  For the present, in answer to the above mentioned enquirer:
I get my snuff by post from Wilson's & Co, (Sharrow), P.O.Box 32, Sharrow
Mills, Sheffield S11 8PL, U.K.,tel. 0114 2662677.  Established 1737.  About
70 varieties. (They also make 12 varieties once manufactured by the late
lamented Fribourg & Treyer which used to be in the Haymarket,London.)  Ask
for a brochure.
Smith's of Charing Cross Rd, London, est. about 1860, is in the Digest list
of retailers.  Frederick Tranter is at 5 Church Street, Abbey Green, Bath,
U.K.  Both also have an extensive range.
I just got back from 8 weeks in San Francisco, where I couldn't find any
decent snuff.  None at all in Holland, where the famous old shop with
`SNUIF' over the door has turned into a restaurant.  A lot of German snuff
is imported here, but all of it seems to be unsniffably mentholated.

<a name="3">Subject: Pipe Smoking As An Art Form</a>

Perfectly smoking a perfect pipeful of tobacco can be one of the 
greatest and most satisfying experiences one can have.  Alfred Dunhill 
didn't idly call his book "The Gentle Art of Smoking."  But like all 
arts, there is effort, experimentation, error, discouragement, growth, 
and learning as one moves through stages of beginner, apprentice, 
craftsman, and finally - an artist of pipe smoking.
   The perfect pipe -  An autumn evening. The wind rustling the trees.  
>From afar, a subtle smell of burning leaves.  You light a fire in the 
fireplace, watch out the window as the golden slanted light of the sun 
warms the room and illuminates the air. You light your pipe, watch the 
smoke rise and become transfixed in the shafts of light.  You pass the 
bowl of the pipe under your nose and smell ITS nose, a warm mellow aroma 
that evokes memories and reveries.  The feel of the pipe in your hand, 
its deep color, its pattern of grain bubbling up like some hidden secret 
signature of things.
   The pipe has smoked through its top third and now the combustion is 
easy and assured.  The smoked tobacco has baked and cured the tobacco 
under it in the pipe and now its flavor becomes richer, mellower and more 
concentrated.  You breathe slowly through your nose, pipe in mouth, 
puffing as slowly as possible because you know that there is a perfect 
temperature where the tobacco and pipe will yield all their aroma, all 
their taste, all their pleasure.  You find that ideal realm and the 
pleasure becomes more intense.  Your thoughts slow and then stop -all the 
distractions end: it's just you, the room, the fire, your pipe.  Time 
seems to stop, the pipe seems to smoke forever.  As Rimbaud once said: it 
seems like the pipe is smoking you!
    Not you're about 3/4 through the pipe.  Run a pipe cleaner into the 
shaft, remove and re-tamp.  Now you know why you smoke pressed-flake 
Virginias because now the pipe moves to its climax - a zone of aroma 
richness, mellowness and flavor that almost causes you to doubt that it 
can be possible.  Now you know why the Indians considered tobacco the 
path to the gods.  And it is a simple act, a gentle act - a skilled 
physical act, to be sure.  But it is mostly a mental act - an act of 
concentration, an act of awareness.
    True pipesmokers will recognize the experience; beginners and 
apprentices need to know that it is possible and is worth pursuing.  
Sometimes it comes out of the blue and you don't know how you did it. 
That is why the craft of pipesmoking is important.  It's frustrating to 
do it by accident and not to be able to do it at will.  In my 20 years of 
off/on pipe smoking I have been a beginner and apprentice many times, a 
craftsman erratically, but I have achieved that art enough times to know 
that it is worth pursuing.  Worth pursuing with a passion.  Tolkien once 
said that he loved waking up each morning because it meant another day  
of pipe smoking.

I have one that pipemaker Clarence Mickels restored and he did a great job

        I would also like to take this opportunity to report on the first
meeting of the as-yet-unnamed pipe club serving pipe smokers/collectors in
the mid-Hudson Valley area.  After talking about doing it for a year, vast
throng of four of us got together for diner at Aloy's Garden Restaurant in
Poughkeepsie in the evening of November 15.  They had arranged for us to
have our own room in which we had drinks and a terrific Italian dinner.
Albert DiFalco was elected president.  The purpose of the club was
articulated as being a forum for pipemokers to gather to show off pipes,
share tobaccos, tell tall stories, trade & sell pipes, and to promulgate a
multi-directional flow of pipes 7 tobacco information among the
participants.  So, we did that.

        I brought along some Charatans, including two Supremes from a
collection I bouight this past week, as well as two exquisite Radices and
an unsmoked Peterson's Handmade which Mike Hagley had sent.  I also talked
about my new-found interest in SMALLER pipes (my appreciation on that score
has recently been raised by Andrew Marks...thanks, Andrew) and so brought
some lovely old BBB's and a small 3/4 bent Apple stamped "Selected English"
and "straight grain" (anyone know about the first stamping?).  I popped
open a vintage tin of "Four Monks" and also a Perique-free mild, full
English I just got from the Owl Shop in New Haven, "Harkness Tower"

        President DiFalco brought his perfect ring-blast Savinelli
Autograph and a beautiful, small, gold-banded Peterson...also some
Woodlands tobacco from Mel Felman's Smokerin Albany.  Howie Rothstein was
smoking his favorite Irish Seconds bent Papa and we spent some time trying
to determine why this pipe was a "second" with only three tiny pits.  A
beauty...growth rings prominent...excellent smoker.  Dick Duncan was kind
enough to share his stash of British Woods and we all moaned over that
exotic tobacco.

         We also discussed ways to attract new members.  This message was
one.  We will also be placing flyers in pipes shops and passing the word by
mouth.  [The day before the meeting, I had stopped at a red light and,
looking in my rear-view mirror, noticed a guy behind me smoking a pipe.  I
jumped out of the car and went back to give him my card and invite him to
call me for information about the forming club.  (Haven't heard from him
yet...hope he didn't think that was too bizzare.)]

        We went on to work out meeting dates and places for December
(breakfast) and January (dinner) meeting and talked about smoking contests,
outings to the pipe shops in NY City, and perhaps a club trip to one of the
Tuesday meetings of the NY Pipe Club.

        I'm sharing start-up information with Ira Stone in Philadelphia and
Grant Porter in Sunrise, Florida both of whom are trying to organize pipe
clubs, and I invite correspondence with any other fledgling club
organizers.

Hi Steve and all my pipe smoking friends,
This is just a note in response to the request from Julie Whitefeather in
the latest P.D. for info on pipe making.  Julie, my friend and the Sec'y of
the pipe club of which I am a member, a fine gent named Bill Unger talked
me into writing an article on pipe making for the amateur which was printed
in our club newsletter.  After receiving a few good remarks from fellow
club members, the article was subsequently reprinted here in the Pipes
Digest.  If you are interested in a how-to article slanted toward the
starting pipemaker, you will find it in P.D. #214 in the archives.  Allow
me to suggest that if you heve even the slightest interest in learning how
to make your own pipes, let nothing stand in your way.  This is just about
the neatest hobby one could imagine, especially for one who loves to smoke
pipes.  I don't sell my pipes, but just give them to my friends or smoke
them myself.  The gratitude received from a good pipe smoking friend upon
receipt of one of my hand made pipes exceeds any monetary reward I could
ever wish for.  Go for it - you'll never be sorry you did.
Regards to all,
Bob

My favorite cigarette rolling tobacco is "Three Castles", also a

Also, does anybody else who buys this feel silly about buying
Virginian tobacco that has been shipped to England for processing, and
is then being sold back to us Americans at a premium? Didn't we fight

Hello Steve,

I think it's time to introduce myself after more than a year of
lurking.  I'm a 27 year old computer science student at Eindhoven
University of Technology, a pipe smoker for about 3 years. But it's
only since my subscription to your mailing list that I've become
more serious about it.

The first time I smoked a pipe was when I was 7 or 8 years old. I
have a 16 year older brother who was in the navy at the time. I
and some cousins were going through my brother's belongings when
he was away for a couple of months and we found a pipe and some
tobacco. I immediately decided to light it. The funny thing is that
I didn't taste a thing, but that my father, who was in another room
smelled it almost immediately and came to my room. He was pretty
mad and told me: "Ik rijt je de kop uit!" (translation: I'll rip
your head of). He was bluffing.

Then, about 16 years later, I had a teacher in university who smoked
a pipe. I liked its smell so much that I decided to buy a pipe
myself. But I never really came to like it. I only smoked a pipe
once a month or so. Then I subscribed to the PD and read about
English tobaccos and decided to try some Dunhill Early Morning
Pipe. Since that time I really got to like pipe smoking. The only
problem was that there isn't much choice in English tobaccos here
in Eindhoven. The PD came with a solution again:  mail order tobacco.
I ordered a trial pack from C&D. Delicious. So, thank you Steve
and all other contributors for all the valuable information I got
from you.

Rook ze,
Paul.

<a name="12">Subject: Life in the slow lane...</a>

     Fellow Pipe Digesters,
     
     I am currently in the middle of a ground war with my wife over the 
     boundaries my pipe smoking must adhere to. I would like nothing more 
     than to be able to sit in the living room, listen to old jazz records 
     (the bulk of my vinyl collection), smoke my pipe and read. My wife 
     would like nothing less...
     
     What this means for me is that I must go out into the public domain 
     whenever I want to smoke - something I dread mostly because I hate the 
     "public" and partially because it means I have to decide where to go.
     
     There are not that many places to really relax and enjoy smoking; my 
     local tobacco shop, The Piedmont Tobacconist (17 Glen Avenue, Oakland, 
     CA  94611 (510) 652 - 7473) though not very large and unfortunately 
     closed during the hours I most need it, is one.
     
     While in public I have noticed two things; people generally object 
     less to pipe smoke than to any other type of smoke, and bars seem to 
     think the opposite is true. I am often stupefied by the "No Pipe 
     Smoking" signs behind bars crowded with cigarette smokers. I was 
     recently told by the manager of this wonderful French cafe that 
     "People often complain about the pipe smoke, so you should smoke 
     outside." This, despite the fact that no sooner had I wandered outside 
     to smoke my pipe was I followed by someone who simply wanted to say 
     they liked the way it smelled !!?!??
     
     Life goes on and while it does I will keep wearing bow ties, listening 
     to records, smoking my pipes, drinking tea and ordering hamburgers in 
     restaurants known for their fois gras.. damn the mechanical pencils...
     
     One thing is for sure, though, and that is I can't wait for this cigar 
         craze to die. Nothing bothers me more than getting that cokeyed 
     grin or the expression of camraderie from obvious yuppies while I am 
     walking down      the street with a Partagas 150 billowing smoke. I 
     went to check out this   new cigar lounge (the title, cigar lounge, 
     makes me cringe) named of all   pretentious things, Fume'. It is only 
     a block from Union Square, San       Francisco which should give you 
     some hint as to its target audience (Union Square, for those who don't 
     know, is lined with Tiffanies, Gucci, Bullock & Jones, Saks 5th 
     Avenue, Nieman Marcus, Macy's, and the one good store -    Bang & 
     Olefson Stereos.)
     
     Anyway, after walking into "Fume'" I took one look at the prices and   
         decided to check out the liquor store across the street - just to 
     make     sure. And, as I had suspected, $14 for a Nat Sherman "Gotham 
     500" is just  way too much. Besides that the food was overpriced and 
     the only other      people in the place were these "just stepped out 
     of a Johnny Walker        advertisement" twentysomethings with Tag 
     Huer watches and Nautica ties. 
     
     The point, oh yeah - there was one you know, is that as far as it 
     seems to go "I would rather sit on a pumkin and have it all to myself 
     than share a  velvet cushion" as the saying goes. That is to say, if 
     fitting in as a twenty-four year old pipe smoker requires dressing 
     like a clown, acting like the court jester and playing the fool I'd 
     rather make my appearance as the crotchety old man... (we all need 
     role models.)
     
     Enjoy,
     
     Adam.

Steve,

Have received your fine publication for a number of months, and although I
usually agree with most of what you post in the newsletter, I am sorry to
see that you allowed the following to make the pages, let alone to seem to
condone this by stating you were looking forward to the scan.

This letter states that a <high school debating team> is currently smoking
pipes between rounds.  This means that the students must be between the ages
of 14 and 18.  At least in Ohio, it is ILLEGAL for anyone under the age of
21 to purchase tobacco.

We are here to promote the enjoyment of pipes and tobacco, but only the
LEGAL enjoyment and consumption of the product.  I would hope we do not
encourage the ILLEGAL consumption of the product, which only serves to have
the Pleasure Police come down on us for promoting underage smoking.

Susan M. Sansenbaugher
???????????????????

[ This is a delicate issue.  I re-read the original article, but
didn't note that the authors had claimed to be underage, or to have
purchased tobacco for themselves.  Other circumstances are also
possible.  Also, I do not know where the debate team hails from, and
am not a lawyer, so I don't know what laws apply in their case.

You are correct that it is official Digest policy not to condone
illegal actions.  Therefore, if the debate team has violated the law
to prepare the scan, then the Digest will not publish it.  If they
send it, I request that the submitter attach a note avowing that he
has not violated the law by purchasing tobacco underage.

Members are cautioned, once again, not to submit anything to the
Digest that they would not wish to have shouted from the rooftops. I
try to look for this kind of thing, but stuff occasionally gets by me.

I apologize for any difficulty my comments may have caused. -S. ]

<a name="16">Subject: Four Square</a>

Hi Steve and fellow smokers,
On PD225 I read a call for info on the Four Square Green Mixture
and on PD227 a Danish fellow gives an answer to the call.
I would give a little contribute to this query saying that Four
Square Green is one of the best English Mixtures with Latakia that
are imported in Italy;it is not expensive and is a good
alternative to the two Balkan Sobranie that in Italy are still
distributed.These three mixtures plus the Caledonian 466 Mixture
(a Danish one) are the only smokable Latakia mixtures available
here in Italy;these simple infos may be completed by the awareness
of what is happening to these mixtures on a world scale.
Years ago, Latakia blends were well-known and smoked by a great
number of people in every part of the globe and a they were
produced by a great number of firms.Naturally the main producers
were the British (great firms or little firms or local
tobaccoonists).As time went by we faced two kind of fenomena:
1)Some UK great firms began to be in trouble to maintain the same
quality standards for these blends both for costs reasons both for
the year-to-year changing in tobacco harvests and also because
smoker's taste has been somewhat changed towards a sweeter kind of
tobacco.The result was that some great tobaccos were discontinued
some others has been changed in the formula (in order to meet the
different demand) and others decided to have their own mixtures
made by other firms.Balkan Sobranie,for example,decided to reduce
costs by eliminating the tins and using the pouch plus modifying
the cut (I noticed it is thinner than in the past) but it is still
a great tobacco.Other firms,unfortunally,make such changes that
the final result is unsatisfying with a loss in market shares.
2)The Danish firms learned how to do English Latakia Mixtures in a
perfect way in some case marrying the tradition with the classical
sweet Danish tobacco(i.e. Bengal Slices) in other cases
manufacturing such good blends one could think they are produced
in the Victorian England.
An example is the Olsen firm that produces an esquisite Nr.7000 My
Own Mixture that is a really perfect smoke or the Nr.9001 that is
excellent.
It is obvious that good U.K.mixtures still exist ,expecially
handblended from local tobaccoonists,but it is a little more
difficult to obtain them.
To mention some good mixtures avalaible in the continental
Europe(but not in Italy) we have the following:Fox's Banker's
Mixture,Fox's Campanile Mixture,almost all the Rattray's
mixtures,Simmon's Down the Road Mixture and so on.
So,as you see,not everything is lost!

Felice Mocci

Dear Fellow Members:

Greetings! Thought I'd take a few and introduce myself.  Im thirty two
and have been puffing seriously for just three months.  I'd had the
occasional cigar before,put never liked them as much as the pipe. The
tobacco gene skipped a generation in my family-both my grandfathers
smoked,and I can remember my paternal Gramps rolling his own cigs with
a pipe tobacco called Cutty Sark that came in a brown paper carton. Of
course my parents are rabid anti-smokers who where quite dismayed when
my sister started sneaking smokes in the girls room in high
school. Now that I've joined the opposition so to speak their not
pleased,although my mother admits that though she wishes I didn't
smoke, "it sure does smell good" -when's the last time anyone ever
said that about a cigarette?  Both my wife and mother in law are
smokers so I get lots of support from that side. I can smoke in any
room of the house! My late father in law had a fine collection of
meerschaums that unfortunately for me were sold at a garage sale
shortly after hiss passing.  Some lucky dogs must still be thanking
the good fortune that allowed him to snag the entire collection,with
walnut rack, for less than $100!!

I'm a slave in an office by day,an try to make time for my avocations
of acting,singing and writing.  I have a small reputation as a
performer around town(mostly Shakespeare and Gilbert& Sullivan) and
have been lucky enough to get a sweet gig as theatre columnist for a
local newspaper.  Other interests include bonsai,ethics cooking and
mountain biking.  Im probably not the first guy who was induced to
take up the pipe by two people-his wife and Sherlock Holmes.  I was
working my way through the casebook of the great detective when my
wife Jacque noticed the Paget illustration on the front cover,of the
great detective with a straight stem briar clenched in his teeth,and
remarked that I would look good with a pipe. ( I believe she has a bit
of a professor fetish going-she also encourages me to wear corduroy
trousers and tweed jackets with elbow patches) Any way,it wasn't long
before I went from hounding her to quit to dragging her along to the
smoke shop.  Still trying out different tobak blends,and tend to favor
aromatics.  My pipe collection is only seven items at this time,all
bents,with an even mix of brand new and estate models. Cant say I have
a favorite yet,though I prefer Petersons and similar type big,bent
pipes.  I'm lucky to live in a town(Columbus,Ohio)that has several
fine smoke shops and some very talented pipe makers.  My S&R wood
craft is a real beauty and I intend to acquire several more of S&R's
great looking,great smoking pipes.

Enough of that,right? Time for some questions:

 I prefer smoking aromatics,but it takes a really strongly flavored
mix for me to get any hint of flavor in my mouth-I just taste
smoke. It has been suggested that it takes time to develop a palette
for the subtle flavor Does that sound right to any one?  I was a
little disappointed when I got my new Peterson home and discovered two
plainly visible fills on the bowl that I swear where not there at the
store.  Any clue on the method used to keep me from noticing them
until the pipe was bought,paid for and smoked?

Thats enough for now  I think..

Cheers

[ I can probably tell you about the fills.  They're usually pretty
well covered with stain, and some of the stain rubbed off as you

A little about me before I ask my question (hopefully to ease the
humiliation of my asking)....

I'm 22, and I have been smoking pipes for about a year now.  I own three: A
Savinelli, a BBS, and a Comoy's Royal Guard.  I, too, am a convert from the
cigar crowd, although I still enjoy a good cigar occasionally.

Now for my question.  As the subject of this message suggests, I am having
a very difficult time enjoying the last half of the bowl.  The first half
is wonderful, but then it starts tasting ... well, pretty bad.  So I think
I've smoked it all.  But when I empty the pipe, there is still a half a
bowl of nice brown tobacco.  Is the solution as simple as letting it burn
out half way through and emptying the top half?  It doesn't seem like this
is the "right" way.  But what do I know after a year...right?

I've enjoyed reading PD and look forward to the next "issue."

Steve,
     Ihave been a subscriber for about a year now and must compliment 
you on the fine job done on this publication.  I first got to 
subscribe as a cigar smoker and linked to the page that way but after 
reading a couple of issues it peaked my intrest in reintroducing 
myself to the pleasures of pipe smoking.  About 20 years ago I was an 
avid pipe smoker and collector but my intrest wained and I gave most 
of my collection to friends, however I retained a few of my 
favorites, mostly GBD's and one double walled ceramic with a painted 
windmill on the bowl.  Well enough of the prattle.  To my question.  
I seem to remember an issue that mentioned a restorative process for 
stems but can't seem to find it in my back issues.  Is there any way 
to remove the brown discoloration from the stems of my black stemed 
pipes?  They were stored in a closet for 20 years and when 
rediscovered the stems are rather unsightly.  Can you or any of the 
readers help?

Stay in Peace and tranquility.  Keep those matches dry?

abrasives should gently remove the discoloration. Then rinse. -S. ]

I received this inquery. if anyone can help I m sure she d appreciate it.
The only pipemaker I could think of is Lepetier, but I don t have his
address. Thanx MT

I'm a Bethany College art therapy student on the search for information
on making ceramic tobacco pipes. (I live in a community that is kind of
choking to a person of my age and curiosity.) I have an intrest in
learning how to make pipes and I would like to do a project on the
designs of older culture's designs in pipe making (Irish). Would you
have any information that could be of use to me? Jessica Crane

<a name="22">Subject: Hi</a>

Ok, got the issue printed, have to fold and staple now.  There is a full
page on the lighter and on the email addresses.  Should work out just
fine.  You should see you copy in a week or so, with the holiday, i will
either get them all stuffed into envelopes faster, or much slower, who
knows!

Got a great article on the Ohio Pipe Club in this issue, really great
and the photos are very clear.  Should please everyone!  Great photo of
Bill Unger and Regis Mc.  The December issue will have the photos from
the IAPSC pipe smoking contest, great photos.  I'm going to get a flat
bed scanner the mustek 800sp which should give me much better photo
input.  

I have been thinking about the idea of putting the gazette on a web site
instead of on paper.  That would allow full color without the burden of
offset printing.  Instead of subscriptions then it would require
advertsing support.  Its an idea, don't know what impact that would have
for readers, perhaps a combination of printed for those who want to
subscribe and on-line for the computer folks.  Sounds like a lot of
additional work, somehow.  :)

I like the pipes web page.

I have a post office box now also, would you update the resource guide?
its P.O. Box 930401, Wixom, MI, 48393

Have a good holiday!  Neil

[ Address updated.  See the [BLATANT PLUG] above for a good Web
site. :-) Looking forward, as always, to the next Gazette! -S. ]

<a name="23">Subject: Boswell Pipes</a>

	Mornin there Steve,

Hey, you have got to check out a new internet site I found.  They sell J.M. 
Boswell's pipes.  Steve, I've been smoking Boswell's pipes for years...it is 
my favorate pipe and a SWEET SMOKE.  He makes them by hand, freehand that is, 
with greek briar.  Besides, I met J.M. once and he is a hell of a craftsmen.  
His Church Wardon Pipe is great.  I did try to smoke it in church one day, but 
got kicked out.  So much for loving your neighbor.  Oh...Davidus Cigars & 
Pipes sells them (www.daviduscigars.com) or 
1-(888) HABANA1...check them out! Have you heard of Boswell before?

~\u~\u~\u~~~~\u

[ Yes; I have two Boswells, bought for a pittance at the NYPC show a
couple of years back.  Both have thin walls or thin spots.  Boswell
tends to leave flat spots on his Danish freehands; I noticed this on
another freehand.  If this is deliberate, I'd appreciate it if someone
could explain the reason for it.

Thanks for the Guide update! -S. ]

<a name="24">Subject: Oslo, Norway</a>

The Winter 1997 issue of _Pipes and Tobaccos_ has an article devoted
to a nice-sounding little tobacco museum in the headquarters of the
Tiedemann's tobacco company in Oslo.  The museum is prevented from
publicizing itself by Norwegian law, and the address was not printed
in the article.  If one of our Norwegian members could send in the
museum's contact information for the Guide, (and if doing so won't get
anyone in trouble), I'd appreciate it!

				Smoke in peace,

join us as we find a suitably Clausian clay (or did Santa dabble in
the occasional stogie, too?) and settle down for a long Winter's
relaxation.  And with this issue of the Digest, which includes a
Dickensian mystery, a purloined pickelhaube, and the first piece in
several years from our prodigal puffer, Bill Thacker...

to all my pipe-puffing friends,

The Houghton-Mifflin publishing Co. is giving books to children's
hospitals; how many books they give depends on how many emails they
receive from people around the world.  For every 25 emails they
receive, they give one book--it seems like a great way to help a good
cause.

All you have to do is email ??????????????? Hope you can spare the
seconds...and let your friends know. So far they only have 3, 400
messages...last year they reached 23,000.

Again, the address is ?????????????? (Share The Spirit Campaign)

<a name="4">Subject: Custom Pipe Lighter Design Ordering Information</a>

Since nobody objected to the design, the design is going to be:

          )           (         
         (  The        )  
          ) Internet  (
         (  Pipes      )
          ) Mailgroup (
         (             )
          U/~ (_{@}__||
  
Based on the 42 responses I received before the deadline, the lighter
is going to be:

        Pipe Lighter (unanimous)
        Black Matte (27 votes)
        Color (28 votes)
        Three Color (21 votes)

Three color design has the smoke and ash in gray, the lettering in
green, and the pipe & cigar in brown.

Based on this decision, the price will probably be:

        $15.91 (cost of black matte pipe lighter)
        $  .55 (shipping from the distributor to me)
        $ 1.01 (shipping in the US from me to you)
        $  .40 (one padded envelope)
        ------
        $17.87 
        
If fewer than 50 people order, we'll have to eat the $45 service
charge, which will add ~$1 to each lighter. Please keep this in mind.

Please send me email with the following:

        * The number of lighters you would like

        * Your mailing address

Send no money yet! On January 2, I will make the order with the
distributor and send you all email with the final price. Six to eight
weeks later I will get the lighters from the distributor and send out
email again, requesting payment.

Note to non-US residents: You will have to pay more for shipping,
obviously.

Note to Steve: Please post this to the digest as well, to see if
there's anybody interested now that the design is final.

Steve and all,

        just a quick update on the goings-on on the web page:

        1) 'tis the Christmas season, and so there are two pictures that
reflect this.  the banner image is from Enzo Medici and above the digest
articles is the Mark Tinsky Christmas pipe.
        2) there is a new page at <a href="http://www.pipes.org/what_you_need.html">http://www.pipes.org/what_you_need.html</a>
that talks about what a person needs to get started in this fine hobby of
ours.  it was created in the hopes that novices can know what to look for
when they walk into a store for the first time.

Hi Steve:
        Enjoy the digest much. I was wondering if there are people in the San
Diego, CA area who either have a pipe club going or are interested in
starting one. I am! I tried posting to ASP to get something going and
got one reply from a nice fellow pipe smoker in L.A., not exactly around
the corner.
        Thanks for all your work on the Digest and any help that can be
provided concerning the whereabouts of a pipe club.

Steve,

After reading several reviews in Pipes Digest and Pipe Friendly Magazine and
perusing the American Smoking Pipe Company web site, I finally ordered Mark
Tinsky's 1996 Christmas Pipe in a natural finish.  The pipe arrived three
days later and it is as good looking as I had hoped.  I waited until the
relaxed four day Thanksgiving weekend to try it out.  It was worth the wait;
it smoked great right from the first bowl.  This was an early Christmas
present to myself.  

New subject - does anyone know what happened to the Iwan Ries web site
www.iwanries.com? I can no longer find it there and there is no pointer to a
new location.

From: Kevin C Halaburda <?????????????????????>
<a name="8">Subject: "underage" pipe smoking</a>

Hello Steve,

	In the latest issue of Pipes Digest I just received in my mailbox,
I read a mail addressed to you from ??????????????????? . Susan
Sansenbaugher (I think that's the right spelling) stated that since a
person in high school must be between the ages of 14 and 18 (falsehood
#1), it is illegal what they are doing, because at least in Ohio, tobacco
purchase is illegal for anyone under 21 years of age (falsehood #2). Maybe
you've gotten similar letters like this one. I certainly hope I'm not the
only one who caught this, since her writing was terribly flawed.

	Firstly, four people I know entered high school when they were 13
years of age. No, this is not important and rather irrelevant, but they
have late birthdays in December, and were all 13 entering school in late
August. And, the fact she posted this first piece of bogus info and based
a conclusion on it is poor logic. Secondly, I myself live in "The heart of
it all" in Ohio, and I've been buying pipe (and other kinds of) tobacco
since the day I turned *18* years of age. Not 21, but 18. Legally. Matter
of fact, I have the priviledge to buy not only tobacco, but also long
rifles, a whole array of anything considered 'adult' entertainment
materials, and almost anything limited to adults. 'Adult' status in Ohio
is reached at the age of 18 years. On the day of my 18th birthday, I was
able to purchase all of this, enter into legal contracts, even join the
armed services of the US, but what I still cannot do is have a beer.
Alcohol, unfortunately, is one of the few select items that is limited to
those over the completely arbitrary age of 21 years. 

	What I'm getting at, Steve, is that Susan should have become
familiar with the age at which persons are legally permitted to purchase
tobacco products before sending such a mail to you. As a matter of fact, I
cannot think of ANY state, or even any country, that requires a person to
be 21 or older to purchase tobacco products (please fill me in if I'm
wrong). I'm only 20 now, and unless some law is passed before I buy a tin
of MacBaren's down the street in a half hour, I will still be within the
bounds of the law. Sure, when I buy a pipe, a pack of smokes, or a stogie,
I get 'carded' almost every time, and I am well aware that I fall into the
age group and fit the stereotype that buys the 'pipes for tobacco use
only'. No, I don't buy those things, but I would not be reluctant to do
so, as it is my legal right. I have no real problem with this, and I CAN
agree with her, and say that I'd never buy tobacco for anyone under age,

Hi Steve,
How are you today ?  I just wanted to let you know, if you hadn't heard
already, on behalf of Sam Barnett and Rich Esserman, that the next NY
Pipe Club Pipe Show will be on Saturday March 8th, 1997 at the Ramada
Hotel Newark Int'l. Airport.  There will be an in-formal get together
the night before at 8pm.  I'll be looking forward to it.  Perhaps you
can post the message to the next digest.

Also, Sam has asked if I could find out if there might be some reason
why he has been unable to access the Digest over Compuserve.  Any ideas?  
Hope to speak to you soon, thanks.

I know everyone says it, but I have to add my thanks to Steve for all his 
efforts in maintaining this list for the benefit of pipe smokers 
everywhere. I know I've benefitted from it as so many others must have.

I'd also like to publicly thank all those who responded privately to my 
post a couple of issues ago. The single biggest help I received was when 
someone suggested I just remove the twisted metal "filter" from my bent 
Tsuge - what a huge difference! No more gurgling and sour taste as I 
smoke past half the bowl. I really feel as though I'm getting something 
out of it now.

I've been trying to get all of the back issues of PD, both from the FTP 
site and web page, but it's been a slow process due to international 
conjestion, I believe. I normally access at night here in Japan which is 
the daytime in the States, so the server is probably busier at that time. 
(I'd love to see more of the PD back issues on the FTP server as I seem 
to have better luck there - hint, hint.)

Anyway, my point is that beginners like myself can find lots of 
information in the back issues that is truly helpful. Unlike a lot of 
mailing lists on the net, PD doesn't suffer (much) from the timeliness 
problem. Pipe smoking is still pipe smoking, now or in the past. Besides, 
there are loads of interesting stories and anecdotes that are well worth 
reading...

My queries this issue:

First, has anyone had any luck contacting Iwan Ries' web site? I've been 
trying on and off now for a couple of weeks and continually get a "no DNS 
entry" for it. I wonder if it's just my provider...

Second, can anyone recommend a humidor for pipe tobacco (and where to get 
them)? Here's what I'm after - something that holds about 4-5 oz. maximum 
(I'm a light smoker) and looks nice enough to put out on my bookshelf. If 
you have Hacker's Ultimate Pipe Book 2nd Ed., there are some photos of 
ones that I think look good: pages 72, 105, and the porcelain one on 195. 
Any help here would be appreciated.

May you always have understanding friends, enough matches, and good 
tobacco.

Steve and the Ever-Increasing Band of Faithful Subscribers
 
As we enter the last month of 1996, it's time for me, with your indulgence,
to plug the Ohio Pipe Collectors again.  We currently stand just 7
dues-paying members short of 200--a goal I would very much like to achieve.
Dues are still only $12 per year, pro-rated by the month for new members,
which means anyone can join now for the rest of this year and 1997 and
receive the last newsletter of this year, which will appear soon, and the 4
1997 issues.  Plus, I will also send a copy of the Oct. issue--the biggest
one yet.  That issue contains a great article (if I do say so myself) on
Mark Tinsky, Curt Rollar and the American Pipe Smoking Co., which I'm
afraid is too long to send to the Digest. It also contains the following
profile of American pipe maker David Jones--a fine pipe maker and a
fascinating individual, whom I had the very great pleasure of meeting after
the article was published.  I hope everyone enjoys reading it as much as I
enjoyed working on it.
 
DAVID JONES IN HIS OWN WORDS
 
Many of you already know something about the pipes of David Jones because
Steve Richey has been singing David's praises ever since he won a David
Jones Regency (donated by Mike Spicer) in our show raffle last year--a win
that has, I believe, led to several more purchases.  I'm very pleased to
present this conducted-by-mail interview with David so that you can learn
something about the extremely interesting man behind the pipes as well as
more about the pipes themselves.
 
I'm 57 years old and work as a Senior Buyer with a Government Prime
Contractor in Texarkana, TX.  This means that I'm responsible for procuring
specially designed metal components from job shops all over the U.S.  I've
been with this company for 32 years.  Brenda, my wife, is a successful
realtor, and we have two sons and two grandchildren.  I work four days a
week at my regular job and make pipes the other three days.
 
My father was a carpenter and a farmer, and he taught me early the value
and importance of hard work.  I've always loved working with wood.  As a
boy of 14, I studied taxidermy, and I enjoyed carving the mounts and bases
for the birds and animals I mounted. During the 1970s and '80s, I was an
accomplished wood carver.  I specialized in hand-carved and hand-painted
realistic waterfowl decoys.  The pay wasn't very good because of the time
needed to complete a piece, but it was a labor of love, and money was not
the objective.  But carving decoys became boring and creatively stifling
because realistic bird carving requires that you copy exactly what nature
has already created.  I do still carve caricatures when I can find the
time.
 
At 13, I taught myself to play the guitar.  During the '60s and '70s, I
played lead guitar for David Houston, Bob Luman, Cal Smith and Tony Douglas
when these performers came to town.  I've played guitar on three 45s for
regional artists here.  I mostly play electric guitar, and my favorite
instrument is a Gretsch Country Gentleman that I purchased new in 1963.  I
played Rock 'n Roll in the '50s and '60s.  I guess I prefer playing
country, but I enjoy all types of music.  I've done some singing with bands
I've played with, but I've never attempted to write songs.  Today I collect
vintage guitars and still find some time to play.
 
Over 20 years ago, I learned bonsai--the Japanese art of artistically
training miniature trees.  It remains my favorite hobby.  My back yard
contains a growing/display area with some 51 trees, most of which I have
developed and trained over the years. They require daily care in the
growing season.
 
As a boy growing up in Texas, in the summer I tended a country store my
father owned.  One elderly gentleman would walk to the store for his
tobacco.  He'd enter with his pipe going, and I've never forgotten the
aroma of that pipe and the way he'd tamp, fondle, light and just enjoy it.
I was 13, and that really impressed me.  At 14, I obtained an old pipe.  I
remember having two pipes but don't remember how or where I got them.  My
dad wouldn't have approved, so I kept them in a hollow log in a forest on
our property, along with a can of very dry Prince Albert.  (Today my
favorite tobacco is a medium to heavy Oriental blend such as Balkan
Sobranie 759 or Dunhill 965, although I also enjoy some of the wonderful
McClelland Virginia mixtures.)  I enjoyed smoking those pipes whenever I
could find the time.  When I left home at 19 to join the Army, one of the
first things I did was buy a good pipe--a Kaywoodie Prime Grain.
 
Thus began a lifelong love affair with pipes.  I've collected and smoked
high-grade briars for 35 years now.  I have about 130 pipes in my
collection, and I regularly smoke Upshall, Charatan, Barling and Dunhill,
but mostly I smoke my own rejects.  I prefer Canadians and billiards.
 
In the 1960s, I obtained a couple of low-grade briar blocks and attempted
to make my first pipe.  But I didn't have the time, skills, tools or money
to pursue pipe making at the time.  Making a living for a growing family
came before all else, so I put my desire to make pipes on hold.
 
In 1986, while visiting a small local pipe shop owned by a friend, I
spotted a copy of the Pipe Collectors International magazine.  It was his
only copy, but he insisted that I take it. At home, I read it cover to
cover and discovered that there were many sources for first-quality
plateaux briar.  The timing was right, and my desire to make pipes was
rekindled.  I had the resources, the time (the children were grown), the
skills and the means to get what I needed to try my hand at pipe making.
 
I started slowly, with the goal of making a few pipes to see if I could do
it.  In 1986 and 1987, I made about 30 pipes, all hand carved with knives.
I attended a PCI show in 1988, found out how much I didn't know, and filled
in some of the blanks.  I'm especially grateful to Jim DePrey and J.M.
Boswell for freely sharing their knowledge with me.  In 1989, I attended
the PCI show in Philadelphia.  I sold seven pipes at that show and came
away determined to see where this could go.  I decided to get serious about
pipe making.
 
Within two months of that show, I'd converted a three-car garage into an
air-conditioned shop (a necessity in Texas).  I purchased a lathe, some
tools and equipment that I'd located, and a full bag of first-quality
plateaux briar.  I was in the pipe business. The pipes began to sell
immediately, and they continue to do well today.  In 1992, I built a
separate 20 X 30 foot shop specifically designed for and dedicated to pipe
making.  It is fully insulated, with heating and air conditioning, dust
control and lots of natural light.
 
In the past eight years, I have experimented with all sorts of shapes and
finishes--some of them really weird.  However, during the past five years,
most of my work has conformed to traditional shapes.  They are my favorite
shapes, and they seem to sell better than the freehands.  All my pipes are
hand made one at a time, which makes it unlikely that any exact duplicates
exist in the pipes I've made.  I guess I've been most influenced by the
early Charatans.  The Charatan was always my personal favorite.
 
I'm just about totally self-taught.  I'm sure that some of my methods are
crude and labor intensive, but they work for me.  I have no idea how other
pipe makers perform most of the specific operations necessary to make a
fine pipe.
 
I'm particular about the briar I use.  I buy the finest I can obtain and
reject a good percentage of that.  In 1993, I spent a lot of money
searching for a better grade of wood.  I bought Corsican from two sources
and a batch of Moroccan at premium prices.  The overall yield from this
briar was no better than the extra- quality plateaux I use regularly.  Most
of my wood is Extra Quality Grecian, and all of it is plateaux cut.  I
still have about 90 blocks of old Algerian plateaux.
 
I bought heavily in briar in the early years so that I can maintain a solid
six-year supply, and I only use briar that is five or six years old,
meaning that it has been in my care for five or six years, where it ages
and cures under the proper conditions.  For at least two years before I
work the briar, it has been stored in my climate-controlled shop.  So I'm
always working with well-seasoned briar.  My pipes have a reputation for
breaking in easy and smoking cool and dry.  I believe that the time and
care that I give the briar and my careful carving methods are responsible
for the positive responses I receive.
 
Pipe making remains a part-time venture for me.  I'm currently making 110
to 130 pipes a year, a total that will not change significantly until I
retire, probably not before I'm 62.  From 1990-94, I averaged 150 or so
pipes a year, but I wasn't able to continue that pace on a part-time basis.
 
My grading system is simple and straightforward, and I haven't changed it
since I started.  It starts with a hand-carved (rustic) finish that I stain
black, light tan, or medium brown. I create this finish by hand with three
or four tools that I designed and made.  Suggested retail on these pipes is
$170.
 
The rustic finish is followed by five smooth grades, which grow lighter in
color as the grades progress to the high end.  All my smooth grades are
grade marked as follows, with their suggested retail prices: S for
Standard, with a walnut stain ($185); E for Excellent, with a tan stain
($210); P for Premier, with a natural finish ($250); PP for Premier Elite,
with a natural finish ($300); PPP for Premier Ultra, with a natural finish
($425).  All my grades are also available in Extra Large, Colossal and
custom made-to-order pieces.  "Natural finish" means a very light stain to
provide contrast between the soft and hard fibers of the wood. Some of my
pipes have a natural grain contrast that needs no stain.  All of my pipes
are carnauba waxed.
 
Every pipe I've made is stamped with my signature and the words "HANDMADE"
and "USA."  As of May, 1996, I dropped the REGENCY stamp, which appears on
all previous pipes.  This was a marketing name I chose at the beginning
because I felt that my name was too hopelessly common to stamp on a pipe.
However, the calls and correspondence that I receive refer to my work as
"David Jones pipes," and I kind of like the sound of that.  Maybe it's
because I've heard it so much that I've gotten used to it.  The final
Regency pipe I produced is numbered 61082.
 
Every pipe I make is given a serial number, which contains a date code.
The first digit in the number represents the year and the following number
is the exact sequentially numbered pipe since I made my first one.  For
example, number 5975 would have been made in 1995 and would be the 975th
pipe that I've made.  In the year 2000, I'll probably use an alphabetical
character to designate the year.  My stem logo is a 5/32-inch round
mother-of-pearl dot. These dots are produced for use on fretted musical
instruments, like guitars, as fingerboard position markers.
 
I sell wholesale to tobacco shops.  My warranty means what it says.  I
guarantee each of my pipes for one year against burn-out and will replace
it with a pipe of similar quality at no charge. I believe I have replaced
some six pipes out of 1100 or so shipped.  Some of these were questionable,
but the customer really is always right.
 
If I have a philosophy of pipe making, it is simply to always try to make
the current pipe a little better than the last one.  I'm an apprentice to
my own standards, and I almost never measure up. I don't use shape charts
because each of my pipes really is totally hand made, and I personally
perform each operation on each pipe, from design to final buff.  I try to
take the best advantage of the unique grain in each block I select to
design a pipe.

<a name="13">Subject: new bent stem pipe</a>

Hello Steve and all fellow pipe smokers!

First a brief introduction. I'm 28 years old and have been smoking a pipe
off and on for about six years. I've been a pipe smoker wanna-be since the age
of 12. A friend's father was a pipe smoker and I always loved the smell.

I bought my first pipe (likely at K-mart or the like) while at university
but gave up in resignation and would throw it all away.

I got e-mail access in 1994 and soon found out about Pipe Digest.  So I've
been an avid pipe smoker since January 1995.  I smoke only aromatics. I tried
a couple Englishes and found them NOT to my liking.

Now to my question:

I own three pipes. My newest is my first bent stem pipe. It smokes well, but
I find the bottom very soggy.  I asked a pipe smoking friend about this and
he said it's because it's new but the first two pipes didn't have this problem.

Is it something to do with the fact that it's a bent stem pipe? What could I
be doing wrong?

Thanks for you help.

By the way, if there's anyone else out there from Montreal or surrounding area,
and would be interested in forming a club, let me know!!

[ Re the soggy pipe, it's not likely that it's wet just because it's
new.  If the same tobacco smokes OK in other pipes, it's not a
humidification problem either.  I'd suspect some design flaw that's
either trapping moisture or encouraging excess saliva to accumulate.

<a name="14">Subject: submission to digest</a>

     My name is Tim Bender, and I am a new subscriber to Pipes Digest. I began
smoking pipes about 2 months ago. Since my 18th birthday this July, I had been
a cigar smoker. One fateful day, however, I went to the mall to buy a Good
Cigar at the tobacconist's, having saved a decent amount of cash for that
purpose. (I am an impecunious college student.) On an impulse, however, I
bought a cheap corncob and some Borkum Riff instead of a Montecruz. I
immediately vowed never again to touch a cigar. By now, I have acquired two
briars (a Dr. Grabow {oy vey} and an anonymous one marked "Imported Briar,"
both bent) and a meerschaum. (For some reason, my relatives have been sending
me a whole lot of spending money lately. I put it to good use.) I also have
started using better tobacco; the Smoke 'n' Snuff (the local tobacconist) #10
blend is good.
   I am sending this letter because I wish to find out more about my
meerschaum. This is how I found it: I was at an antique store in Sarasota, FL,
looking for records. In a display case, I saw a meerschaum, in the classic
turk's head shape. I asked if I could take a closer look at it, and found it to
be a beauty. Imagine my surprise when I saw the pricetag to proclaim that it
cost $15.99!!! I immediately started looking for things wrong with it (A friend
of mine owns a meerschaum and had told me what to look for.) Most surprisingly,
I noticed NOTHING! I bought it; it smokes much better than either of my briars.
The pipe came in a soft cloth bag marked:
       David P. Ehrlich Co.
       Pipe makers since 1868 (? this is in small print)
       Meerschaum and briar
       Boston, Mass. 
Can you tell me anything about the company?
    On another note, I very strongly support your stand against the "Pleasure
Police." To quote T. H. White, "I am an anarchist, like any other sensible
person," and in my eyes the recent stand of the government on smoking (among
other things) is deplorable. Keep up the good work-- the recent Great American

am intrigued about pipe smoking.  One of the largest questions I have

I would like to repeat my research from PD226 since I need more than
the 20 answers I have received until now. Maybe I was a bit too subtle
with question 3, I was referring to people's more 'private parts'.
The only conclusion until now is that some readers have a sense of
humour AND that it probably is a bad idea to invest in the tailor
business...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
FROM PD 226: I hope you gentlemen reading this will help me with
my research by answering 3 simple questions:

1) In which side of your mouth do you usually carry your pipe?
   (LEFT, MIDDLE or RIGHT)
2) Are you lefthanded or righthanded?  (LEFT or RIGHT)
3) To which side do you 'carry' as your tailor probably asked you
   at your first visit to him.  (LEFT or RIGHT)

The answers can be very short like this (my data) LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT.
Jokes about straight and bent stems etc. will not be appreciated!!

<a name="19">Subject:  PIPE - Need Help Identifying Pipe</a>

Greetings, fellow pipies! (G)

Recently, I rescued a beautiful danish freehand from the depths of a
grungy box at a local flea market.  Some loving care, not to mention a
serious session with my polishing wheel to strip off the sludge,
revealed a gorgeous straight grain, and a wonderful finish that just
about glows.  It was minus a stem, which has since been remedied
courtesy of Steve at the Malaga Pipe Company.  (An interesting note -
the stem cost about 4 times as much as I paid for the pipe!  And,
that's not a comment on Steve's repair pricing - he's quite
reasonable.)

Anyway, I'd like some help on identifying this beautiful piece.  If
possible, I'd like to know manufacturer, and approximate date of
manufacture.  Beyond that, any other information would be welcome.
The pipe is a 1/8 bent (almost a straight), and fairly large.  The
bowl, which has a typical plateau top, measures 3" from top to base.
The shank is 2 1/2" long and is an unusual wide rectangular shape, and
measures 15/16" across the top (from one side of the shank to the
other).  The following information is stamped on the bottom of the
shank:

                        HAND MADE
                            IN
                         DENMARK

                        TOBAK'S VIKING

                           IIS

Any information anyone can provide on this wonderful pipe would be
greatly appreciated.  I tried a post on alt.smokers.pipes, with no
luck.  But then, we're obviously a more knowledgeable group here (G).

						Thanks,

							Jim Dunne

Hi William,
Yes,I know that Rattrays are now made in Germany but I think that
it is not important who blends them but how it does it.I think
that these blends are still a good smoke although I am now curious
of what degree of wonderful smoke they were when You smoked them
twenty years ago.The same thing,as You know,happened to Balkan
Sobranie that changed in almost everything but the quality that,I
think,remains quite high.
You will have noticed that in my mail to PD I intentionally
neglected a famous firm that in the past was one of most beloved
by us.This firm has outsourced to another firm the blending of the
mixtures.Nevertheless ,in this case the result was such that I
don't buy this tobacco anymore.It is not only a complete different
series of mixtures but ,worst,it is no more smokable.Maybe the old
ones are available only in their London shop,but for the rest of
the world market it is a bare loss.Sadly I continue to buy their
excellent pipes and lighters using them on other firm's tobacco.
The final sense of this discussion is that the culture and making
of English Mixtures is,for several reasons,changed from a
regional-wide culture to a world-wide one and in this change we
lost something.
Hoping that the trend could be reversed I will open a can of Black
Mallory and puffing in my pipe give to you and all fellow pipe
smokers the best wishes for the coming holidays.

Best
Felice Mocci

Hey Steve,

First, I want to thank you for all the work you put into the digest.  I have
only been receiving it for a few months now, but I have learned very much.  

Let me introduce myself...

I am a 21 year old student at Cleveland State University in Cleveland,
Ohio with a major in Electrical Engineering. I have been smoking a
pipe for the past year during which my collection has grown
steadily...I am up to 13 pipes.  Included is a Peterson Kilarney, a
Turkish Meershaum, Big Ben, Comoy, Stanwell, Paronelli, and some
others.

By the way...  I know it was a long time ago (October), but the
C.O.R.P.S. pipe show in Richmond, VA was great.  The people there were
very friendly.

Now to the point...  I responded to David Castro's comment on Boswell
pipes.

"Steve, I've been smoking Boswell's pipes for years...it is 
my favorate pipe and a SWEET SMOKE.  He makes them by hand, freehand that is, 
with greek briar.  Besides, I met J.M. once and he is a hell of a craftsmen.  
His Church Wardon Pipe is great."

As soon as I read it, I called and ordered a maple stained church
warden.  In fact, I ordered it on December 5 and got it today
(December 6)...how's that for service!  David was right, it smokes
great and looks even better.  Thanks David.

Thanks again for the digest...

Have a smoke on me,
Mark Osowski

<a name="27">Subject: Plug Tobaccos</a>

Hi Steve and Fellows,
I think that one of the fascinating aspects of our Hobby is the
possibility of scanning several countries in order to improve the
knowledge on tobacco-related items from everywhere.
The most interesting results are achieved when one meets tobaccos
or blends which are very peculiar of some particular
Countries. With reference to this,lately it happened to me that a
friend,back from Ireland,gave me a lot of strange envelopes
seeming more chokolats or cakes than tobacco.In effect,this is
tobacco and its name is "Plug Tobacco".In Italy it is a kind of
smoking absolutely unknown and I was quite impressed both by the
package both by the smoking features of these brands.They look
like little bricks that are well moisted and futhermore they keep
themselves moist for a long time.They are easy to carry because
the dimensions are those of a bubble-gum package and ,what is
best,it is an excellent smoking.I tried the following:
-Condor Plug
-Mick McQuaid Plug
-Spillane's Garryowen Plug
-Potomac Plug
-Warrior's Plug
All of these are similar in taste and smoke even being different
one from each other in flavour and little things;the taste is of
pure tobacco and the burning,when learned how to manage it,is long
and fresh.A very good tobacco.The friend who purchased it said
that it is a traditional Irish Tobacco kind and the Irish use not
only to smoke but also to chew it when they want.
Unfortunally it seems that it is not available outside of EIRE and
I will ot have the chance of smoking that on a regular basis.
W.Hacker in his book relates on the manufacturing of this tobacco
and I suppose that in USA it is not so unknown.
Is someone aware of this kind of plugs in the States?
I would be glad to have more infos on the issue.

regards from Felice Mocci

<a name="28">Subject: Great Moments in Pipe Smoking</a>

In recent weeks folks have been contributing their ideas of ideal pipe
smoking moments to a.s.p.  Here's mine, sans brandy and Vivaldi <g>...

As kids, my friends and I would spend many summer nights camping.
Lacking sleeping bags, tents, freeze-dried shrimp scampi and other 
such high-tech outdoor accessories, we would lug a pile of 
quilts, a ridiculously heavy tarpaulin, and most of the prime parts of
a fair-sized pig into the wilderness.  (On one occasion we left the
pig at home, electing instead to carry fishing rods.  I'll share the 
"fish stew" story some day, but for now it's still too painful...)
Invariably, it would begin to rain, and we would spend the evening in
the cramped shelter of the tarp, puffing away on "borrowed" cigars or
cigarettes, or on our homemade corncob pipes stuffed with Dad's tobak.

As some of you know, I'm a US Army officer, and my current job often
finds me alone in my HMMWV (the proper abbreviation for the celebrity
station wagon known as the "Hummer").  Before departing for the field
last week I tossed a corncob pipe (included as a joke with the beautiful 
pipe cabinet my father made for me for Christmas) and a pouch of Sir
Walter Raleigh (which Joel Farr had sent to me to scan for a woman who
is constructing a web page memorial to her father, who was a pipe
smoker).  Upon arriving in the field I received a weather report which
predicted rain--a rare event here in the Mojave.  Since my HMMWV has
no top, I rigged my heavy-duty 14' X 17' tarp and prepared to weather
out the storm.

Shortly after sunset the rain began.  With nothing else to do, I dug out
the pipe and the tobacco and lit up.  About five minutes into the
smoke I was overwhelmed by an incredible feeling of deja vu.  The sound
of the rain, the rough cob against my palm, the smells of wet tarp and
Sir Walter Raleigh (the very brand I had often liberated from my father)
in that tiny space transported me back 25 years to those wonderful days 
of my childhood.  I literally laughed out loud and realized that it just 
doesn't get any better than this...

<a name="30">Subject: Pipes in Flight</a>

My, what a flattering welcome home!  I feel like the prodigal son!

And it's mighty nice to be back, let me say.  I'm quite pleased to 
see how well the Pipes Digest has done in my absence (and let's have
a big hand for our host:  the Baron of Burl, the Count of Calabashes,
the Duke of Dunhill, the most Puissant Puffer of Public-domain 
Pipedom, Mr. Steve Masticola!) 

As veteran readers of this list may recall, I dabble in the scholarly
pursuit of pipe history.  Specifically, I preserve some of the most
obscure pipe-lore, bits of which I've been able to share in this 
digest.  

Recently, life presented me with a rare opportunity to investigate 
the pre-history of pipes first-hand.  I was offered a position with
a team undertaking a new archaeological excavation of Roman ruins!  I
had to accept on rather short notice (hence my sudden and unexplained
disappearance from this group), and I have just recently returned to
set my findings to paper.  

It will take years to catalog everything we've learned from this dig,
but I can say already that our findings will shake the very 
foundations of our understanding of the history of pipes.  Indeed, 
our new discoveries lead inexorably to the conclusion that pipes were
the defining factor in the history of western civilization!  

But alas!  all that must wait for another day.  As my way of saying
"Hello" again to the Digest, let me share with you another 
anecdote on the pivotal role of pipes in aviation history.  

As an observant reader mentioned in the last digest, I long ago 
recounted the heroic fight for the skies of Europe in WWII. The 
British pilots, burning high-octane Latakia in their aptly-named 
Spitfires, grappling with the Germans in their cool-smoking 
Messerschaums... those were the glory days of Pipewar. After the war,
the fast, new butane-fired jet pipes burst onto the scene, followed
soon by computer control, smoke-by-wire systems, carbon-carbon 
composite stems... and soon, the human factor disappeared from this
modern, piezo-electric war.  

As aviation buffs will attest, the most influential person in modern
aviation is Kelly Johnson, chief design engineer for Lockheed.  What
the buffs may not know is that Johnson was an avid pipe smoker, and
his penchant for strong tobacco led to the most advanced aircraft 
ever built.  

Lockheed had contracted to provide a new high-altitude reconaissance
plane for the air force, and Johnson had the engineer's equivalent to
writer's block.  As lead engineer, he was constantly bombarded with
questions and problems; even his office offered no refuge from phone
calls and meetings.  But the final straw was when his boss gave up
cigarettes and ordered a "No Smoking" policy throughout the building.
Johnson refused to comply: and his boss knew he couldn't fire Kelly.

So they moved Johnson and his team to a small shed to the rear of the
main Lockheed building.  Here he could retreat from the interruptions
and concentrate on his design work... and most importantly, he could
smoke his pipe in peace.  And smoke he did!  The shed was soon filled
with pall of pipe-borne pleasure, but the acrid smell of Johnson's
prized Turkish blends was enough to drive the faint-of-heart away at
first whiff.  When visitors inquired about the smokey little shack,
tour guides would just laugh and say, "Oh, that's where The Skunk
works."

You all know the rest.  Lockheed produced the U-2, which provided 
aerial surveillance of Russian tobacco harvests for many years.  Next
came the SR-71, the fastest plane ever built, able to fly from New 
York to Los Angeles in less time than it took to smoke a single bowl.

My sources within the defense and tobacco industries tell me that 
Lockheed's Skunk Works is currently working on improved stealth 
technology to produce a Stealth Pipe. This technological marvel will
be constructed of the latest composites, shaped to virtually 
eliminate its radar signature.  Special emissions control also make
it invisible in the infrared and olfactory spectra.  Whereas a 
regular pipe can be detected by an anti-smoking zealot from up to
200 feet away, a Stealth Pipe is said to be virtually undetectable 
at more than six feet.  It also features first-strike capability:  
that is, it will always light on the first match.  

In an age of growing anti-smoking sentiment, such technology may
prove invaluable!

Well, that's all for now!  I've got to get back to my next epic, 
"The Pipes of Rome."

	 whiskey and car keys to teenage boys." - P.J. O'Rourke

[Bill, it may not be cause and effect, but in addition to the skunk
works, space exploration seemed a lot more fruitful in the days when
the engineers could keep their trusty pipes by their sides.  The days
when cigars signaled the successful completion of a mission.  These
were the bold explorers who launched Explorer, Telstar, Tiros, Ranger,
Surveyor, Lunar Orbiter, Pioneer, Voyager, Viking, Mercury,
Gemini... and Apollo. One small smoke for (a) man, one giant leap for
mankind.

Since NASA has exiled the pipes to the parking lot and the cigars to
the cars, what have we had?  The Challenger disaster... Hubble's

I inherited a pipe from my grandfather. He picked it up in Germany in WWII.
I don't know if he stole it from a house or bought it off someone but I'm
fairly sure it was a WWI era pipe.

Anyway, I think whoever is a descendant of the original owner would want to
see it or get it back.

It's not in my possession at this time or I'd give you a detailed
description of it. I am going to my mother's at Christmas and will pick it
up. I am basically wondering if it is possible for some one to help me
locate the owner's descendants.

The pipe is about 16 long and has an ivory bowl with a helmet covering the
bowl (a kaiser helmet with one of those points on top) on the bowl there
are names inscribed, one name is the name of the person the pipe was
presented to, below that their are names inscribed of the soldiers in his
regiment.

When I get the pipe later this month I'll email the names. But, do you
think you could help? I live in California, USA so it would be hard for me
to get much info from Germany.

Anyway, let me know if you can help.

It's been suggested to me that, somewhere, CD uses the term,
a "Broseley," to signify the long-stemmed clay tobacco pipe,
usually known as a "churchwarden," provided to people
in inns and taverns, calling for pipe and tobacco.  Broseley
is a village in the Potteries region of Staffordshire, where there
was a kiln producing such pipes.  This is being recommissioned,
and opened as an industrial museum.  The organisers have contacted
me with this suggestion, and are keen to establish a Dickens
connection.

I suspect they may be wrong.  I've checked the usual reference
books without success.  Nor is it to be found in such an obvious
place as "A Plated Article."  My voices tell me it may be in
one of the _HW_ or _AYR_ articles, not by Dickens, but supposed
to be so, or in something Charley wrote, post 1870.  I notice
there are several pieces on tobacco in _AYR_, but I've not had
time to check them yet.

Has anyone come across this usage, in CD's own works, or in
associated works?

[ADMIN] When members report possible spams of the Digest, they will be
given the benefit of the doubt in the absence of other evidence.
Events of the past week (see later) have convinced me that it's
necessary to take this tack.

If you are a retailer and maintain a mailing list for your customers,
please keep a log of all requests to be placed on the list.  It's
unfortunate that the honest merchants have to play defense, but the
spamsters have made life on the net more difficult for all of us.

Also, a reminder: The only way to avoid spam is to keep your address
confidential. If you don't want your address to appear in an article
you submit, please remind me to remove it at the start of your
article. I'd be glad to do so.

[BETTER THINGS] And now on to this issue of the Digest, which features
notes on the scene in Japan, the continuing saga of the German WWI
Soldier's pipe, and a few humid notes...

<a name="2">Subject: pipe tobacco humidor </a>

re Rob Anderson: 
&lt;Second, can anyone recommend a humidor for pipe tobacco (and where to &lt;get
them)?

I use kitchen storage jars much like you would see in some tobacco stores on
the tobacco bar. they are inexpensive ($1-$5) and easily found (Target,
Wal-Mart, kitchen supply stores. some tobacco stores will carry them, but
jack up the price). They hold moisture pretty well, but I'll throw those
little aluminum-wrapped clay tabs soaked in water into them, or use the
tube/sponge-type thingys found at most tobacco shops. This isn't the most
elegant setup, but since i like to keep several blends on hand, i was able
to pick up around a half-dozen jars of different sizes without robbing a
bank or being too tacky.

Steve,

Hello again!  Due to the lack of "quality" Internet Service providers, I
have had problems keeping a consistent email address.  It is good to "be
back" as a recipient of the Pipes Digest.

I have seen mention of a humidor made from a U.S. Army ammunition box.
However, I have not been able to locate any instructions.  Because I have
won a hard fought battle to smoke in my den with the door close, I now want
to _keep_ tobacco on hand.  Does anyone know where to find the instructions
on making a humidor from a metal ammunition box?

Thank you.

[ There's been a discussion of "ammo boxidors" on alt.smokers.cigars
from time to time.  Some are of the opinion that the boxes pick up
machine oil, which might give an unpleasant taste to the
tobacco.  Can anyone here comment? -S. ]

<a name="4">Subject: A simple humidor for pipe tobacco! (Less than $25.00)</a>

  I discovered a simple and fairly inexpensive way to create your own
  humidor (correct word?) for your pipe tobaccos. I personally will usually
  end up keeping  about 5 or 6 different blends on hand. I always had
  problems with leaky or inferior zip-lock bags...and would end up drying
  out all my tobaccos if I couldn't smoke them fast enough. Well, I took a
  cue from my local tobacconist's store and decided to make my own
  containers for  my tobaccos. I noticed that this particular cigar and
  pipe shoppe had bought a lot of simple glass jars & lids. The lids had a
  cavity in them that you could stuff a hunk of foam (you know, that
  eggshell foam stuff. Pardon my ignorance of the real name) into it. That
  way, you have a nice large glass jar (the kind that I used is called a
  "hermetic" jar) that you can fit anywhere from 3 to 5 ounces of your
  favorite blend. All of the pipe folks that I have talked to state that
  they see no problem using standard tap water to moisten the foam.
  Distilled water would work also, of course. This setup works great as
  long as you never appply moisture directly to the tobacco.

  Here's the shopping list:
  Half Dozen to a dozen 12 oz. glass jars and lids
  -- 12 fluid oz. should fit about 4 oz. of tobacco
  -- The best kind of lid to find is the sort with the plastic stopper
  across the bottom of the lid. Just cut a circular hole into the plastic
  and jam your foam into the empty cavity
  -- These jars usually run you about $1.00 to maybe $1.50

  2 to 4 sq.ft of packing or "eggshell" foam
  -- a 2 sq.inch hunk should be just perfect for the inside lid of a 12 oz.
  jar.
  -- a package with 2  sheets of foam in it, about 1 sq.ft each, should run
  you about $1.50 to $2.00 max.

  A 12 to 18 oz. Spray Bottle or Misting Bottle
  -- This is a perfect size to fill with water and use for moistening the
  foam inside the jars.

  With the average price of the components being fairly cheap, this makes
  it VERY simple for you to set up your own humidor for as many different
  tobacco blends as you like. Just apply 2 squirts of water to the foam
  with your handy spray bottle, usually every other day. You might want to
  check the jars once a day for the first week or two, that way you can get
  a good idea of just about how fast the foam will dry out.

Steve, and PD Readers:

Well, it's been almost a year now since I started smoking pipes, and not much
less than that I've been reading the Digest (being a true Internet Junkie,
the first thing I do with any new hobby is look online).

A little over a month ago, I moved from upstate NY to Silicon Valley in
order to take something of a geek dream job with PGP, Inc (encryption is
a hobby of mine).  My wife and I both came out to find a place, and then
she flew back east to tidy up while I started work.  Unfortunately, my pipes 
remained in her luggage!  Faced with a week alone and no pipes, I resolved to 
find a tobacconist in my new home.

I live about six blocks from the downtown area of a charming little town
called Burlingame.  It's the sort of place with little store-fronts and
sidewalk cafes.  While I was sure I could find something in San Francisco,
I decided to search the archives for "Burlingame."  Sure enough, in #194,
"JR" (the only signature on the message) describes the Burlingame Smoke Shop,
at 1400 Burlingame Ave.

At the first opportunity, I headed to 1400 Burlingame Ave.  My approach was
such that I turned a corner to my right, and a door marked 1400 was on my
right; the door for the Burlingame News Stand (or somesuch).  I walked
inside, and while they had a lot of magazines and a very wide selection
of cigarettes, and some old signs for cigars, there was nothing of note
to a pipe or cigar smoker!

Dejected, and assuming that they must've thrown in the towel on the
upscale tobacco business, I walked out.  For the heck of it, I turned
right again, looking for a place to have lunch.

Imagine my delight when, next door - 1404 Burlingame Ave - turned out to
house "Burlingame Tobacconists!"  The people inside the store were quite
friendly, and I have to say I was very impressed.  This is my first experience
with a "real" tobacconist; in my town of 25,000 in upstate NY, there literally
wasn't a pipe store for fifty miles - and that was primarily a newsstand in
a bad section of Syracuse.

I purchased a wonderful Peterson Emerald and a tin of Dunhill Nightcap (the
latter on the reccomendation of a staffer).

They encouraged me to sample their store blends with my new pipe, and to
stay and chat.  The lighter they have is a most wonderful contraption!  I
don't know if anyone here is familiar with such devices, but it dates from
about a hundred years ago.  The bottom is a metal cask filled with naptha.
- From there, a wick runs up through a straight, brass handle, which is 90
degrees up from the table-top.  If you pull the handle towards you just
a few degrees, a circuit is completed between the handle and a tab protruding
from the top of the device, resulting in an arc which lights the wick. A
jar nearby houses cedar strips which you then light from the resultant
flame and use to ignite your pipe!

I have dropped numerous hints to my wife about the location of this
establishment, and am optimistic that I'll receive some pipish presents
this Christmas.

In any event, thought you'd like the updated address (1404, not 1400
Burlingame Ave) and name; otherwise, the shop is as described.

Hope you (and all the readers) have an excellent Christmas, and a happy
and prosperous New Year!

Regards,

Brett Thomas

<a name="8">Subject: Beer</a>

Hello, everybody.

I was just wondering if beer is too off-the-topic for this digest.  It is, of
course, often enjoyed along with a nice cigar or pipe.

So here's my question.  What is the different between regular beer and winter
beer.

An example would be Samuel Adams' Lager, compared to Samueal Adams' Winter
Ale.  

Thanks alot,
Mike

[ Well, it's a _little_ off-topic, but I suppose that there are those
here who like a beer with a smoke, or vice versa. -S. ]

hi Steve,

Thanks for the good work on the digest!  

Hope maybe some of your readers can help with information about a pipe
that belonged to the wife's grandfather.  I've never heard of the company.
The pipe is an 8 panel pipe with a square shank, marked on the one side is
"HOLBORN" and below that in smaller letters "LONDON MADE".  The other side
is stamped "4441"

Thanks for the help,

hi steve, 

as a fairly recent subscriber to the pd, i stumbled across anthony's
request for help with locating the original owner of a 16', ivory bowl,
WWI pipe that his father got whenever he was in Germany during WWII. pipes
were indeed rather common among soldiers as a present on the occasion of
birth or turning 50 or 60 years of age. it will be fairly easy to find the
complete name and rank of the previous owner IF TROOP HE BELONGED TO IS
INSCRIBES AS WELL. in any other case, it's rather hopeless.

then again, having only the full and rank of the soldier will not be
sufficient. a lot on geanelogic (kill me for my spelling!) documents
burned or got lost during WWII. thus, it will be hard to find out about
descendants "the formal way". an informal way to locate descendants is to
place a sipmle and small add in the newspaper of the town where the pipe
was originally presented to the soldier. 

i will look forward to the next issue of pd. hope that i have been of some
help; and furthermore also hope that i can be helpful in the future.

alex.

p.s.: i could not contact anthony directly since my fast (but old!)
terminal program does not display the "@" sign...

[ Alex, I think _both_ questions are about to be answered! -S. ]

<a name="11">Subject: Re: Re Pipe Digest Quirie.</a>

I now have the pipe (actually a little more than just one, I found
that the pipe was in sections and so I have parts of a couple
different pipes) If you have a regimental pipe intact it would be
usful for me to see which parts actually go with this pipe.

I haven't seen the pipe in many years and so I've found out some
things about it:

it's a porcelain bowl not ivory

it has a date of 1901/1903 on the bowl

the lettering and abbreviations are very difficult to read (not bad
quality, just hard for a Yank like myself with no background in the
German language.

To the best of my ability this is what is written above the names (66
names)

"Fram Andenk. a/m. Dienstr.

l.d. 4. Comp. 2 Oberrhn.

Inf. Reg. No. 99 Zabern (Labern?)

1901/1903"

On the front, to the best of my ability:

"Res. Getr. Biemons.

Wernie sein Brod mit Thranen a(letters missing)

Wernie bei Valer Philippsafs,

Werkeine Nachtist durchgebrant

Wirdauch nicht Reservistgena(letter missing)t

Halt Werda!

Die Refervisten der 4 Comp.Linddo,

Anyway, if you can clarify my wording it would be helpful (along with
a translation)

In a couple weeks I will put detailed pictures of the pipe artwork on
a webpage for you to access. It will take a little while to get the
pictures put together, but not too long.

Keep in touch!

<a name="12">Subject: Looking for used pipes.</a>

Hello Steve,

Happy Holidays to you and all the P.D. readers.

I have a question that you or perhaps some of our readers can answer.

If I'm out at a estate sale or garage sale and come across some used
pipes what are some of the things I should be on the look out for?  I
know how to spot putty when it is used to fill in a small imperfection
but how does one know if the pipe is "burned out"?  Beside this what are
some of the issues one should look for.  Also, what should be a fair
price to ask for a know pipe such as a Dunhill etc.

Thanks in advance and keep up the good work!

Hi, folks,

Unfortunately, I'm constantly hounded by the pleasure police. There

my favorite tobacco. Another member of our list suggested looking for
a pipe club. Anyone know of a club in Seattle?

Steve,

Mostly this is about the Houghton-Mifflin book campaign, but
there is a good-news note at the end about a place to smoke in
the Santa Cruz, CA area.

Regarding Rob Denholtz's info about the Houghton-Mifflin book
offer:

	From: ??????????? (den)
	Subject: Fwd: Charity (fwd)

	to all my pipe-puffing friends,

	The Houghton-Mifflin publishing Co. is giving books to
	children's hospitals; how many books they give depends
	on how many emails they receive from people around the
	world.  ...

Please note this promotion has ended and was a complete success,
soliciting 50,000 e-mail messages with the result of 2000 books
for children

Also, let me take this opportunity to remind Pipes Digest
members the following points about relaying information on the
Internet:

	- Aways make sure that you're passing along current
	  information. Information on the Internet travels fast
	  and keeps on traveling, often long after its
	  usefulness has expired.

	- When you forward something legit, always include a date
	  and *never* remove dates from material you forward.

	- Always provide something people can use to corroborate
	  the message (Don did this with the Web addres, although
	  he really should have checked it before resending the
	  message--the Web page 

	- Information mutates as it travels, so *ALWAYS* check your 
	  sources before passing along things like:

		o  Virus warnings: most are hoaxes anyway;
		   see www.kumite.com/myths
		o  Letters to &lt;Whoever&gt; requests (e.g., FCC modem
		   regulation scare)
		o  Postcards/business cards for sick children
		   (such as Craig Shergold and Children's Make 
		   A Wish Foundation)

	  Look before you leap!

In the case of the Houghton-Mifflin book offer, even without the
address "www.polarexpress.com," it took me two clicks to get to
the Houghton-Mifflin Web page (one to www.yahoo.com, the next to
www.hmco.com) and one more click to find out the results of the
promotion (www.hmco.com/hmco/trade/hmi/polar/). The few minutes
you spend checking the facts can save many people many hours of
frustration.

Changing gears...

Good news for smokers in Santa Cruz, CA. A new club is opening
on the Pacific Garden Mall: Cigar Asylum. By chance I met and
spoke with the owner, Rick. He's currently operating out of a
corner of a club called Palookaville, but is building more posh
digs right across the street. (I peered in the window of the new
place...yup, under construction....)

Rick says the facility under construction will have a conference
room available for meetings, multiple phone lines for data use
(bring your own modem :-]), and cigars for sale. He'll also
store a bottle of your favorite spirits for you (port, congac,
etc) on the premisis.

Both the temporary Cigar Asylum and it's soon-to-be-opened
permanent home (January timeframe) are on Lincoln St.  between
Cedar and Pacific Ave. Don't know about hours...he's not even in
the phone book yet, but I'll keep the list posted as I find out
more (address, hours, prices, and so forth).

Seasoned Greetings,

Kam

<a name="21">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #229 -- December 20, 1996</a>

I enjoy the Pipe Digest and look forward to finding it in my emailbox.
My name is Antoine de Carne, I have been living in Australia for 19
years and originally come from France.

I have a good collection of about 120 pipes, some Dunhill, some
Stanwells, Loewe, Peterson (including the Sherlock Holmes Collection) ,
some nice old Meerschaums, many Ropps, and B.Choquin.

My problem is that I have a mother in Chamonix, France who has always
provided me with St. Claude, a tobacco I have started smoking at 16, 32
years ago. She suddenly has become anti-smoking in her old age, and send
me books (which I  would enjoy so much more with a good Ropp filled with
St. Claude) and no more tobacco.

I cannot find any St. Claude in Sydney  and the closest place would be
Noumea. I have written to some tobacconists, but to no avail. I go to
France once in a while but certainly not often enough to get my smoking
ration.

I wonder if anyone had the possibility of obtaining and selling me some
St. Claude, I could pay by Credit Card or Postal Order, or any way they
want.

I would need about 10 packs a month, but any quantity, even one off,
would be welcome.

I wish every pipe smoker a great new year (and to the non smokers as
well)

Antoine de Carne

Steve:

Thanks very much for clearing up my blunder on the phone number for
Stemco-Pimo.  I saw the number as (800) not (802) area code.  Anyway, I was
able to contact them thru e-mail.  Thanks for the fine job on Pipe Digest.
Can't wait to make my first freehand.  Since most everybody gives a little bio
on themselves in PD, I might as well also, to confirm the diversity of
backgrounds for pipe smokers.

I have been a woodworker for about 20 years.  I presently teach fine
woodworking at Santa Fe Community College and coordinate the program, which is
great except for the ream of paperwork attached to the job.  I love to teach,
maintain the shop and manage to find time to fit in some custom jobs for
clients.  So pipe making can be right up my alley.  I really enjoy working in
my own shop and smoking a pipe at the same time.  I am not allowed to smoke in
the house, so the shop, the car, and the great out of doors are my smoking
parlors.  I must admit that smoking out of doors is not my preference.  Other
interests are ham radio, fly fishing, volunteer in mountain search and rescue
and hopefully pipe making.  

Are there any pipe clubs/groups in the the Albuquerque, Santa Fe or northern
New  Mexico area?  I would like to mingle with other smokers.  There definitely
is not a shortage of cigar groups.  

My collection is presently at three pipes:  2 Italian bent seconds, probably
from Brebbia, and a recent corn cob, which I must admit surprised me for $4.00
from the drugstore.  I tossed the filter.  Man does it draw effortlessly.  I
also got brave and pulled out the little aluminum ends of the bits in my two
Italian bents which greatly improved the draw and the ability to run a pipe
cleaner through the bit.

Keep up the good work and I look forward to future issues!  

May the grain be with you!

Robert Lasso

Dear Steve;

Thanks for your great publication!  I've been a subscriber for a couple of
months now
(I'll send a bio later)  and I've been downloading and reading many of the
old issues.

I've searched for info on pipe furniture, but there seems to have been little
discussion on the subject.  I would really like to get one going.  Do most
pipe smokers use pipe furniture?  If so, why and what kind?  If not, why?

I've been considering making a pipe stand to fit my Grandfather's old tobacco
jar humidor in my father-in-laws wood-working shop, and I would love to know
what the good and bad aspects of pipe stands are.  Should I make single
stands, or go for one that will hold multiple pipes?  What aspects of stand
construction can possibly damage pipes?

                       Hope this sparks some interest;
                                     Robert Davis

wobbles :-)  Seriously, one could get really creative with this! -S. ]

Hi Steve, and a happy New Year to everyone!  I'm posting for a couple of
reasons:

First of all, I must sing the praises of Gus' Smoke Shop's "Ancient Mariner"
blend, an exquisite aromatic that they steered me towards when I went in
looking for IRC Three Star Blue.  It's very, very mild without being bland,
and it's sweet without completely masking the natural flavors of the tobacco.
 I am fortunate enough to live just a few blocks from this wonderful pipe
shop in Sherman Oaks, CA, and I'd highly recommend a visit for anyone coming
through the L.A. area!  

Secondly, I'd like to tell everyone about the web site that I'm putting
together right now.  It's called Super-Deluxe!, and ultimately I hope for it
to be a monthly E-zine with articles, links, and what have you.   The site
uses 1950's style graphics extensively, a perfect vehicle for a section
devoted to pipes and pipe smoking... right now all I've got is a link to the
digest web-page, and the FAQ.  I'd really like to be able to put something on
there besides links to other pipesmoking pages, so that people would have a
real reason to go there.... why not tobacco reviews?

I'd love to have the time and money to do a whole section of reviews myself,
but I'm  smoking a lot if I go through an ounce and a half in a week!  I
thought I would turn this over to folks who read the digest, and see if
anyone would be interested in contributing.  I would, of course, include a
link to your e-mail address and/or web site (only if you wanted one, of
course.)  I think it would be fun to set up a rating system on a scale of
1-5, and have reviews mention similar tobaccos so that people can
cross-reference... it seems to me like it would be an invaluable resource to
people like myself who get intimidated by the sheer variety of a well-stocked
smoke shop.  Please, think it over and by all means, check the page out at

&lt;a href="http://members.aol.com/suprdlx"&gt;http://members.aol.com/suprdlx&lt;/a&gt;

Dear Steve,

I love the pipes web page, have it bookmarked, and check it almost
daily.  However (you knew that word was coming, didn't you),
you might want to reconsider listing Peter Heinrich's House 
of 10,000 Pipes.

I linked to their web pages from the pipes web page on Oct.5,
1996 and ordered two Stanwells which they had advertised.  They
faxed me back almost immediately to say that one of the pipes
was out of stock.  When my order came in I was shocked to see
that their prices are German Marks translated, not converted,
to US dollars; that is, 1 dollar = @1.55 marks, but they were
charging the same number in dollars.  Thus one is paying about
55% higher prices than they advertise in their own catalog.

They had also sustituted another pipe for the one which was
not available--this was smaller and more poorly made than the
advertised model.  I returned it for a refund which they assured
me would be forthcoming immediately, but it has taken until now
(the beginning of January) for them to credit my card.  It was
done, but not with the same speed they had in originally charging
my credit card--that was done almost immediately.

Anyway, I thought you might want to know since all the other
links and information on the pipes.org web page are first
class--Peter Heinrich's is definitely a rip-off!

Thanks for taking the time to write.  I understand completely the policy on

they can make their own choice about whether or not to do business with them.

&gt;currently is abusive practices, such as spamming the Digest or

&gt;
&gt;In any case, we do encourage and print comments, both positive and

Merry Christmas & Happy New Year Steve,

I hope you found your Mark Tinsky Christmas pipe as great as I did mine.

My wife Lorraine gave me a Ural lattice finish, full bent (almost an Oom
Paul) meerschaum billiard pipe that she got by mail order from W.Curtis
Draper in Washington D.C.. So, between the meerschaum, my Tinsky Christmas
pipe, and some Balkan Sobranie 759 I had a very relaxed, contemplative
Christmas afternoon.

Just before christmas I called Craig Tarlar of Cornell & Diehl to get a
trial pack of his tobacco.  He was closed for the holidays but he took my
order for shipping after Christmas. We had a most enjoyable chat with him
assisting me in making selections.  He was playing with a Yorkie puppy and
having a grand time while we talked.  I had my three dogs laying on the
floor in front of me at the time so I felt like I was there with him.

I have been trying unsucessfully to locate a pipe club in the Tidewater,
Virginia area (Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk).  So if anyone knows of
one please let me know.

My supply of wooden matches, bought over eight years ago, was almost
exhausted and I was having trouble finding plain old wooden matches.  Many
of the supermarkets no longer carry them but after much looking I found one
that still has matches.  I am back in business again.

Years ago I built a pipe rack onto the panelled wall of my den.  My pipe
collection has outgrown the fourteen pipe capacity of that rack and I'll
have to build another. I will probably make an enclosed rack this time. I
have five meerschaums and they are in their individual cases in a bureau
drawer.  I want to be able to display them but don't want them to collect
dust.  Since woodworking is another of my hobbies, I will eventually get
around to doing this.

Dear Steve;

I was looking over past issues of the digest and saw a post (circa April '96)
from someone asking about pipe/smoke shops in the Charlottesville Virginia
area, to which this person was in the process of moving.  That's my home
ground, so I thought I'd pass along the strongest possible endorsement for my
regular smoke shop called Tobacconist & Gifts in Seminole Square Shopping
Center.  This is an 
old-style, family run business that stresses friendly and informative
service.  The owner is Jack Martinez, a great character and an extremely
knowledgeable tobacco afficionado...he even does pipe repairs and cleanings.
 He's also a former Marine, and an all around good guy.  Polly is usually
there, and she is well versed in tobacco culture, and is also a cigar
aficionada herself. Sometimes Polly's daughter Sandra is there to help to,
and she is very nice.  I drop in there every chance I get just to visit,
always to browse, and sometimes to gleefully purchase new "toys".

They sponsor annual smoker/gourmet-dinners, and they are currently setting up
a special smoker just for Ladies.  At the last smoker I sat at the same table
as former Secretary Of State Lawrence Egleberger (that was a thrill for me as
I love politics).

They have a fully stocked, large, walk-in humidor with a full range of cigars
for any taste and any budget.  And they can outfit you with any cigar related
item you need, from cutters to top of the line humidors.  They even have a
range of imported and specialty cigarettes.

They also have games, knives, knick-knacks, bill-folds and gift items galore.

And as for the pipe stuff...they carry everything!  Lighters by Colibri,
Prometheus,
DuPont and Zippo. Jack blends over 55 Types of regular house-blends, and can
blend to order for you too.  The regularly carry many brands of pipes, both
merschaum and briar:  Aldo Velani, Alpha, Comoy, Fero, GBD, Peterson,
Savinelli, Stanwell, and others, special orders welcome.  You'll also find a
full selection of pipe furniture and humidors, pipe tools, and tobacco
pouches.

I hope this info will help anyone travelling to Charlottesville, or looking
for a good mail order source. 

Here's the basic facts for the guide listing, hope it's formatted correctly:

tobacco.  While still a little light on the pipe aspect  it is a welcome
addition to an area that can only boast, and I use that term lightly, one
Mall smoke shop and several magazine/cigar shops.   A Mr. Paul Pessa runs the
establishment along with his wife and both are eager to please and show their
wares.  My first time in was a great experience with pleasant talk and a
knowledge of tobacco and free samples of pipe tobac to boot.  This is not a
fancy establishment, its located in an older home  in Millcreek Twp. a suburb
of Erie.  The floors are wooden and a fireplace graces the soon to be opened
smoking lounge.  Their grand opening will be in February and I for one hope
to attend.  I have asked Mr. Pessa if he would like to be included in the
digest and he consented.   The address is :

<a name="33">Subject: [Q] Sinclair, Radford, Larsen & BBB tobaccos</a>

Hello again, pipe smoking friends,

I have some questions on pipe tobacco blends that I currently have
in my "inventory."  I hope someone can provide me with info on their
identity and other miscellaneous stuff.

1) "Sinclairs [sic] Navy Flake": I've come to realize this tobacco's
   availability in Japan only recently.  It says on the tin as "Made
   in UK for John Sinclair Ltd, Basildon England" and "Matured Navy
   Blend", but that's all, from looking at the package (I haven't
   opened the air-tight tin yet).  I can't find this listed in the
   AITS Tobacco Index.  Does someone know about the company and
   possible other blends that they manufacture?

2) Thomas Radford's "Sunday's Fantasy": Tinned with a nice painting
   of a Victorian-ish gentleman smoking a long clay, this says on
   the tin as "Approved by Members of the Pipe Club of London /
   England".  This is strongly aromatic from various fruit extracts
   (apricot and even fig?).  I don't recommend this to English
   mixture smoking purists, but the aroma is "savoury" indeed and it
   smokes incredibly cool, perhaps due to its broad cuts.  The clerk
   at the shop where I bought a tin of this told me that this was in
   fact manufactured in Germany.  And I remember a few postings in
   the past from a member of the Pipe Club of London.  Could someone
   tell me anything about the Radford company, their relation to the
   Pipe Club of London, and anything relevant?

3) W. O. Larsen's "Selected Blends": In Tokyo, currently Nos.20 (VA
   based English, with Latakia as spice, one of my current
   favourites), 32, 50 and 80 (I haven't tried these three yet) are
   available.  I wonder how many are currently manufactured by/for
   Larsen.  What are the original prices like in their homeland?  We
   pay 1200 yen (roughly $11 US) for a 50g tin of each.

4) BBB tobaccos: I think this is the same brand famous for their
   quality pipes.  Currently three blends in round tins are
   available here, namely: "Scottish Mixture", "English Mixture" and
   "Oriental Mixture".  So far I have tried the last one, which
   smells like an aromatic but tastes real tobacco.  The description
   on the tin doesn't help; it says "Made in EEC" only.  Do members
   in the UK know that the BBB have tobacco blended for them?  Do
   they make any other blends?  I also heard these are, just like
   the Radford's, being made in Germany and are imported by the
   Japanese pipe manufacturer Tsuge, which suggests that both are of
   similar if not identical origin; are some of our subscribers in
   Germany aware of such a company's existence?

As you can see from above, we may be having a rather exotic
selection of pipe tobaccos over here in Japan (or it may be that I'm
choosing to smoke exotic staff), something (quite?) different from
your area.  I began experimenting with different blends (a natural
reflex from reading the PD :-)) last summer, and at the moment I'm
vigorously (well, as much as my limited budget permits me) trying to
smoke everything from mass production Aromatics to full English
mixtures to flaked Virginias (needless to say, not in a single bowl ;-).

Any input will be gratefully appreciated.

<a name="34">Subject: pipes digest entry</a>

I've only been a digest subscriber for a couple months but I have yet 
to see mention of a great magazine which I came upon last month when I 
was sent a free sample from the publishing company.  It's called 
"Pipes and Tobaccos" and is geared to us in a similar fashion as 
"Cigar Aficianado" is to cigar smokers.  The magazine is high quality, 
not a newsletter, but a first rate mag with great articles, photos and 
advertisements.  I immediately ordered a three year subscription with 
a back order to the first edition from earlier this year.  Judging 
from the letters to the editor everyone else coming upon this mag is 
doing the same thing!  I have no vested interest other than seeing 
this magazine stick around for a long time. The address is:
               
               3000 Highwoods Blvd., Ste 300
               Raleigh, NC  27604-1029 USA

Anyone with even a passing interest in pipe smoking will be 
immediately captivated.  Even my non-smoking friends can't help but 
read it when they see it on my coffee table, wondering if I know 
something they don't (which of course I DO \u~!!).

[I second the thought. P&T is well worth the small amount it
costs. -S.]

<a name="35">Subject: A pipe smokers' meeting in Tokyo</a>

A Very Happy New Year!  Steve and all,

It's my pleasure to report that thanks to the PD as the forum of
pipe smokers and other networking medium (well, e-mails), five of us
on-line pipe smokers living in Japan finally did manage to meet each
other on December 28th.  I'm sure the other two PD subscribing
participants, Andrew Drapp and Rob Anderson, to both of whom English
is their native tongue, can and probably will give better reports,
so I'll concentrate on where we visited.  I hope what follows will
give you a short virtual tour of the Tokyo pipe smoking scene.

The Kikusui, one of the better pipe specialty shops in Ginza, Tokyo,
was the assigned meeting place.  The shop is fairly well stocked
with Butz Choquin, Stanwell, Mastro de Paja and Poul (and not Pol as
I wrote in my Ohio Pipe Collectors write-up in the December '96
newsletter; thanks again for the correction, Jesper!) Hansen
freehands from Denmark.  Apparently they had just received a fresh
selection of several dozen Dunhills, and Mr. Yoshikawa, alumnus
friend of the most experienced pipe smoker among us, Mr. Namba, fell
victim to the ever attractively looking cool black beauty of a
certain Dunhill Shell, while waiting with me for the other
participants to join us.

When all five gathered up and were finished exploring the shop, we
moved to take a longish coffee break.  Then we visited the Tokyo
branch of Alfred Dunhill, where we admired (what else could we do if
we were to respect the price tags?) altogether 20 or 30 beautiful
Dunhill briars including one "Three Stars" straight grain as well as
two (smooth and shell) "Seven Days Sets."  The properly dressed
Dunhill clerks informed us that Nakamura Kichi'emon, one of the
leading Kabuki actors, is their pipe smoking customer.

Our third destination was the Kagaya, another pipe specialty shop in
Shinjuku, approximately 20 minutes by underground from Ginza.  This
shop is better stocked with a reasonable variety (about several
dozen blends) of pipe tobaccos including some Rattray's and Butera
Royal Vintage, as well as lighters, cigars (their recent addition)
and *very* expensive handmades by both Ivarssons, Micke, Chonowitch
and Anne Julie.  Finally, we ended up at a genuine British style pub
called Dubliner's (they claim to be Irish), where we enjoyed pint
after pint of Guinness ("on tap!"), a healthy supply of Fish &
Chips, and needless to say, bowls of pipe tobacco.

Throughout the afternoon and well into the evening, we talked and
exchanged info about pipes and tobacco and other miscellaneous
topics.  All in all it was a very pleasant and memorable
get-together.

that many readers living outside Japan are interested.  Thanks for the
addresses, and for the report! I'd be glad to publish a contact
address for your club, too, if it becomes permanent. -S.]

Steve and all,

[i received this letter from our correspondent on Prince Edward Island (PEI)
Marcus Matzick that i thought i would pass along]

Dear Steve,

        [adminitrivia deleted...]  I have another small favor to ask.  Would
you be able to send me info on Edgeworth tobacco?  I have smoked it a few
times [and it has a] good flavor, but it seems to burn fast.  Also, I would
like info on what the difference is between the four Capt. Blacks?  Flavor,
smell, etc.  I also have a few questions -- do you recommend lighting pipes
with matches or a lighter?  I now use a Zippo pipe lighter.  And what is
your opinion on using run to clean a pipe with?  That is all for now; hope
you have a good x-mas and good smokes to come.

        In smoke,

        Marcus

P.S.  Could you give me info on any other pipesters here on PEI?

[Did you mean using rum?  If so, I think that pure grain alcohol, like
Everclear, would leave less residue.  I use both matches and a
Savinelli Corona butane lighter, as the mood strikes, and have a
request in for one of Eeyore's Pipes Digest Zippos.  Not being a
fancier of Edgeworth's or Captain Black, I'll let others comment. -S.]

Subject: pipes.

Which do you prefer?  Straight-stem or bent?  Personally, I'd say bent
because the moment arm is shorter, i.e. doesn't feel as heavy, but that
doesn't matter if you're going to hold the pipe in your hand most of the time.

	Also, do you hold the pipe by the stem or the bowl? 
	You're supposed to hold it from the stem so as not to let
your own oils discolour the bowl, but then again... ahh...well.

	What's your favorite blend?

From: ????????@????.???????.??? (Steve)

Well, most of my pipes are bent, but I have some straight ones too,
including a nice bulldog from a French maker called Gefapip, a
Canadian by GBD, and an I-don't-know-what-it-is by Savinelli. (It's
small and has a roughly cylindrical bowl and a stem with a bulge near
the shank.) I was in the local Tinder Box admiring a beautiful bent
black GBD today, so my taste hasn't changed that much.

I had thought the same thing about moment arms, too, but just bought a
lot of bent pipes because I thought they looked cool. (Aesthetics, not
heat transfer :-). Actually it's true. If you've ever smoked an Oom
Paul, you'll probably notice that it's a lot easier to hold between
your teeth than a straight or even a half-bent pipe.

I've never heard that about skin oil discoloring the bowl; actually I
thought the opposite was true. Briar pipes, unless they have a really
rough surface, are coated with carnauba wax (a very hard wax; I don't
know from whence it comes.) Finger oils wouldn't matter very much on a
wax surface. Besides, I think it's a little silly to hold a pipe by
the stem unless the bowl is _very_ hot.

Meerschaums, of course, are a different story. They're very delicate,
and acquire coloration as they're smoked. What actually gets colored
is a thin layer of beeswax on top of the meerschaum. Your fingers can
stick to this wax coating and strip it off. Result: a thumbprint on
the finish.

Favorite blend? I don't know; you got one? (I'm serious; I'm looking
to experiment.) When I was in my teens and early twenties, I used to
smoke Amphora just about always. Later I abandoned that for an
English-style blend made by Harry Tint in Philadelphia (which, BTW, is
an excellent shop). Then, for about three years, I've been smoking
"Bean's Special Blend" (yes, by L.L. Bean, the same folks that brought
you Bean's Maine Hunting Shoe and Bean's Sony CD Player.) They've
discontinued that, and I'm at the bottom of my last can. Yesterday, on
Elias Mazur's example (Elias is the co-founder of the newsgroup, and
has taken much flame for trying to establish rec.pipes), I went out
and bought a can of Black Sobranie 759. Delicious! I haven't had
Latakia in ages (I remembered it from _one_ can of some Dunhill
mixture I bought for myself when I was an undergrad.) At the Tinder
Box today, I bought a couple of pouches of some of the store's
"English-style" tobacco; they smell nice, but I've only smoked the
"Sherlock's Choice" (not that that means anything to someone not
living in this part of New Jersey, probably.)

In any case, I don't think I'm going to spend several years with one
blend anymore. I'd like to learn blending and maybe blend my own; is
there anyone out there who has done this? Also, if you like "English"
(non-aromatic) tobacco, I'd appreciate hearing your preferences.
Thanks! 

Yr. obd't. servant,
- Steve (????????@????.???????.???)

(BTW, also, thanks for the quote, Maverick... please send yours in, if
you have a favorite!)

Subject: Pipe auto-biography.

Hi.

First I would like to welcome you all again to the pipes mailgroup. I
fell particularly happy for the creation of the mailgroup, considering
the quantity of flames I got by trying to start the rec.pipes
newsgroup. I am sure that in a near future we will have enough traffic
to justify a newsgroup, moderated, of course. I would also like to
thank Steve Masticol for bringing my idea of a pipes newsgroup into
life.

Well, I am an EE graduate student from Brazil (great excuse for
grammar errors :-) ), in Syracuse University, and I've been in the US
for two and half years. I started smoking pipe about 9 years ago. My
collection is small (13), but is steadily growing. My collection is
divided half bent and half straight stem, mostly because it was
difficult to buy good pipes back in my hometown in Brazil, so I could
not be very picky. My first pipe was a BBB straight stem billiard
style, that my father bought in 1960 and smoked only a couple of
times, in a unsuccesful attempt to quit cigarette smoking. I don't
know if it is for sentimental reasons or for the quality, but it's
still my favorite pipe. Nowdays, I buy most of my pipes bent stems,
like Steve, for aesthetic reasons. I have GBD's, Petersen, Savinelli,
Barling (very good). I also have a nice calabash, Sherlock Holmes
style, with a meerschaum bowl. It is a cool smoke, and the bowl is
turning into a beautiful deep yellow color.

Yesterday I just bought a beatiful bent stem pipe from a italian pipe
maker, Aldo Vilani. I bought in a pipe shop in Utica, Pipes Unlimited,
that I learned about from the The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris. It is a
very nice pipe shop, and the owner, a pipe smoker/collector/expert, Mr
Bob Smith, is a very nice person, very polite, and is always there to
have a chat about pipes. He is the kind of tabaconnist that one wishes
to deal with. He explains about the pipes, the makers, the history of
the maker, new trends, and does NOT try to 'sell' you any pipe. He
lets you choose the one that better suits you. When he saw that I kind
of fell for one pipe, he gave me a great deal on it. I recommend it to
anyone living Upstate New York, or coming this way. If someone is
interested in the address, let me know.


With tobacco blends my story is also related to the fact that few
good tobaccos could be purchased in my hometown. I used to smoke
Amphora's as well, when I could find it. Sometimes my father would
travel to the US or Europe, and would bring me some good tobacco. Now
I only smoke English blends. I can't say that I have a favorite, but
mixtures of Virginia with Latakia specially attracts me. I like some
Dunhill blends, as well as the Balkan Sobraine. I'm glad Steve enjoyed
my suggestion of Balkan Sobraine. I just bought the 759 Balkan today.
I once mix the Half-and-Half with pure Latakia, and the result was
excellent. I really enjoy this home made mixture. I will try new
mixtures soon.

Well, after writing all this about my pipes and blends, there is only
one way to go: drink a nice tea and smoke my new pipe.


              "Give a man a pipe he can smoke,
              Give a man a book he can read,
              And his home is bright with a calm delight,
              Though the room be poor indeed."

                                 Alfred Dunhill ( The Pipe Book )

Have you all a good and relaxing smoke.

Subject: An unscheduled mailing

Well, I'd planned on mailing only once every week or so, but there
have been so many letters coming in that I thought it would be nice to
go ahead and let some out of the mailbag, and get some good threads
going. (Perhaps in the context of pipes, it should be "wisps"? :-)

I'd also like to thank Elias Mazur, the co-founder of the pipes
mailgroup, for suggesting the idea in the first place and having the
courage to put it on the net. Without Elias, it probably wouldn't have
happened, and I'd have never learned about Balkan Sobranie. Elias
apparently got rather harsh treatment from the newsgroups he posted
to; I don't know whether I'm getting flamed or not, because I'm taking
the precaution of not reading the groups I posted to! :-) (Seriously,
I've only gotten a couple of nasty letters, but given Gene Spafford's
dictum to crosspost rather than post separately, I think I'm within
net.etiquette; and you can't argue with the results!)

In any case, thanks to all for joining, and I hope you enjoy the
mailgroup as much as I'm enjoying putting it together. I hope you'll

Smoke in peace,

Subject: Introduction

I am an x pipe smoker who really misses the enjoyment of the pipe.
The reasons I am not currently endulging are many and in future
letters I will probably discuss them.  Suffice it to say that I
*really* enjoyed my pipe and whenever I get a whiff of a good tobacco
the urge is really strong to start again.  

I am not a pipe or tobacco expert and only own a couple of not really
very distinguished pipes.  But that is, at present, irrelevent. 

I look forward to reading about pipes and discussing them with others
on this list (as time permits).  I especially look forward to learning
more pipe lore, tobacco lore, etc.

Subject:  Pipes always...


Hi Steve,

Half-and-Half, if I recall correctly, is half burley and half
virginia. They are pure tobacco. When I was in Brazil I got a big can,
and used to smoke it often, straight. I must confess that although it
was a pleasurable smoke, certainly wasn't superb. I felt that there
was something missing. When I got here I bought another can and kept
smoking straight. One day I visited a pipe store here at Syracuse, and
bought pure Latakia. The person at the store told me it was very
strong and I should mix with a lighter tobacco. That's when I had the
idea of mixing them. Most of English blend follow the same principle.
In Hacker's book there is a good description of most common tobaccos
and what are they properties, such as how hot it burns. I will
summarize them and will pass to the mailgroup.

I don't know if I mentioned, but I tried recently a Dunhill mixture
called 'Elizabethan Mixture'. I never saw it before and decided to
try. It is very good. It has a bit of Perique, which is a Lousiana
tobacco that adds a zesty taste to it. I think it is worth a try.

Good smokes.

Elias.

[ Always! -S.]

Subject: Heel Cake

One of the reasons I'm glad to see this mailgroup is that I may finally
get an answer to a question that's tormented me for years!  My problem
is (snif!) ... I can't seem to develop a good heelcake!  The sides of
the bowl seem to break in just fine, but the heel never seems to follow
suit.  It always seems to get too damp down there.  I've tried different
tobaccos, smoking slowly, smoking more quickly, cleaning less often, more
often, burning match after match even after nothing down there seems to
light, and still it stays slick &amp; clean!  Any suggestions?

By the bye, I would have to be classified as a light smoker.  Not only
do I not smoke every day, I don't even smoke every week!  But I love
a good pipe, with a glass of Armagnac, Calvados, Port, or Barleywine,
in the evening.  I incline toward bent stems and aromatic tobaccos,
and would some day like to own a good long-stem "churchwarden" pipe.

Subject: Carving pipes


I have been working with wood for a long time now.  In fact,  I learned
about this mailgroup from the posting in rec.woodworking.  I would like
to begin making my own pipes, but I don't know where to begin.  Is there
a good reference source?  How about supplies?  I have access to people
who travel to Northern Italy quite a bit.  I understand that Italy has
a lot of pipe blanks,  does anyone know where I can find them?

[There's a company in Chicago called Pimo's that sells briars, stems,
tools, etc. for pipemaking. I'll dig out the reference, if no one else
in pipe-land has it {it's about 100 miles away, in my parents'
cellar}. I've tried it myself, and even bought a flex-shaft to work
with; pipe carving is a hard skill to acquire. Can anyone help Norm

		Pipes Digest #4 [March 11, 1989]

Dear pipe people,

Well, things are rolling in the mailgroup! Our ranks have grown to 22
members, and new people are still joining every day from all around
the country. (BTW, did my original posting have world distribution? I
tried, but I'm not sure I made it...)

I've had a thought for something you might want to try; this seems
like a perfect place to swap pipes. There are two ways we could
organize such a thing: either direct (person-to-person) or a "mystery
pipe" swap; I'd be willing to organize the latter, as long as people
send postage along with a pipe to swap. Person-to-person swaps are, of
course, fine any time.  Are y'all interested?

Speaking of which, I'm interested in finding a hose pipe of some kind.
I've seen them in shops, and had always thought it would be good to
set one on the desk and puff away while working. If anyone has one,
I'll trade for a pipe of comparable value, or cash.

Well, it's time to dig out the Persian slipper for a bowl of shag, and
edit the remainder of this week's letters. Hope to hear from you soon.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Subject: me

Hi,
	I'm Ami Silberman, a graduate student in Computer Science at the
University of Illinois.  I've been a pipe smoker for about 6 years.
Currently, I use about three pipes, one is an old Dr. Grabow, which I use
for highly resinated tobaccos, one is a reproduction 19th century English
clay pipe (you can get them for a couple of bucks, they are made from 
copies of the original molds), and a very unusual Meershaum Bulldog which
I bought used.  (Used pipes are often a very good bargain.)  My tastes
in tobaccos run toward the unflavored, although I do appreciate a little
vannilla or almond, especially in cavendish.  I like Black Cavindish straight,
mixed burly and cavendish, and also blends with Latakia.  I usually alternate
or tobaccos, so I am unlikely to have more than one pipeful of the same blend
in any given day. (Currently I'm working on about 10 different bags of
tobacco.)

I occasionally smoke a cigar, and somewhat more often smoke
ciggaretes.  I've tried Davidhoff's (too dry), Royal Dragoons (by
Simon Artz, Cairo, very yummy), various clove types, and several other
Turkish types.  I had a Galois once, and thought it was the French
equivelent to a Camel.  I think I'll go home and review some
tobaccos...

One thing I would like to see in this mailing list is a review of various
comercial blends, as well as house blends.  Most pipe shops carry various semi-
standard blends, i in addition, they are willing to make custom blends.
We can pass on "recipies" in this way.

Did you know that Aleister Crowley used to smoke straight perrouque (I may have
missed the spelling, it's that really pungent fermented stuff.)

[A number of good ideas, Ami! I checked out the Lahaska, PA flea
market for pipes today; alas. I was disappointed. What would you like
to see in the reviews? We can kick the idea around a little more; is
there anyone who'd like to review their favorite blend [or warn us
about one :-9 ? -S.]

&gt;discussions going. For starters, why not take a few minutes and tell
&gt;us about yourself by return mail? We'd like to hear about your

I'm a gradual student in computer science and I've been smoking a pipe
off and on for almost ten years now.  I started in earnest when I was a
freshman in college.  There is a tobacconist across the street from the
frosh dorms, and I imagine that at some point or other about half the
males wander over and buy a pipe and some tobacco and try to acquire
the habit.  In my case it stuck.  The name of the place is Leavitt and
Pierce, and they are affiliated with J.P. Erlich in Boston.  Both are
very fine tobacconists, and L&amp;P has a one-third-off-everything-in-the-
store sale every year around the end of March.  

I have a number of pipes, but most of them are Erlich's house brand.
These range in quality (and price) from el cheapo (which smoke okay, but
don't look too great) to medium priced/quality (in the $50-60 range).
They have some very nice pipes as well, but I never felt like dropping
that much money on a pipe.  I prefer bent stems since there's very
little worse (for me) than a mouthful of pipe juice.  I don't know what
you'd call my favorite design, but it looks something like: ~\V i.e.  the
stem is bent, but not very rounded, and the bowl has a distinctly
pointed bottom.  Sort of something you'd expect a teenage wizard-in-
training to smoke :-).

In addition, I have a beautiful meerschaum, straight-stemmed Canadian
style pipe that my father gave me for Christmas about 5 or 6 years ago
that is turning interesting shades of caramel in various places.  That is
definitely the coolest smoking pipe I have.  I have the obligatory
calabash for solving crimes (got it for about $25 during one of the
one-third off sales).  And I got a church warden from L&amp;P sometime back
there, which is cool smoking pipe, but tends to really collect
condensation and can be a bitch to clean.  All in all I have about a
dozen pipes.

My favorite tobacco is cherry cavendish; in fact, it's all I smoke.  I
guess I'm sort of conservative on this, and after I read a few more
recommendations here, I'll probably try some others.  Besides really
liking the taste, I stick with the CC for two reasons.  First, I've
never had a complaint about the smell from smokers or non-smokers.
Second, back when I did experiment with various flavors, if I found one
I didn't like it seemed like it took forever to get my pipe to forget
it.  I've tried to find good CC locally, but I finally gave up, and now
I just send off to Boston for it.

Patience, friend.  Try putting less tobacco in the bowl and packing it a
little looser.  To fill a pipe, I was taught to loosely fill the bowl
and pack lightly, then loosely fill the bowl again and pack medium, then
loosely fill the bowl one more time and pack firmly.  This gives a nice
firm pack but leaves air space down at the bottom.  To break in a new
pipe, just do the first two steps.  In my experience, if you use less
tobacco and pack it less firmly, you'll get down to the bottom of the
pipe more quickly with less moisture.  Be careful not to let it burn too
hot though.  Another thing to try is to gently dig up and stir the
bottom when it won't light and try again.

^recreational smoking, such as cigars and gourmet ciggarettes?

Gee, I wish I didn't like cigarettes so much.  To keep myself from
smoking them, I only smoke one brand, John Player Specials (not to be
confused with Phillip Morris's Players, or Player Rough Cuts) and
they're not available in the US.

Back when I was in  college, we got some Balkan Sobranie cigarette
tobacco and hand rolled some cigarettes that were marvelous.  I haven't
seen the cigarette tobacco since.  Anybody seen it lately?

&gt;So, to that end, antismoking rhetoric will be /dev/nulled, and flames
&gt;are to be used only for the purpose of lighting up. 'Nuff said?

This is sort of anti-pipe, but I got a kick out of it, and what the
hell: we're all friends here, right?  I was watching the show Night
Court, and there was a blind man walking around the commissary talking
about how his other senses were more acute to compensate for his
blindness.  "For instance," he said, "I can tell that there are four
people sitting at this table.  Two of you are having tea, one of you is
having coffee, and..." he takes a sniff as he walks toward John
Laraquette who is rather vigorously lighting his pipe "...one of you is
cremating a cat."  

Take care,

&gt;tobaccos, smoking slowly, smoking more quickly, cleaning less often, more
&gt;often, burning match after match even after nothing down there seems to
&gt;light, and still it stays slick &amp; clean!  Any suggestions?

Martin, I had the same problem for many years. But recently a light appeared
at the end of the tunnel (no politics :-) ). My personal problem was that I
didn't smoke the whole tobacco in the bowl. In the book of Richard Hacker
(Steve, please repost my message about the book), he indicates that a bowl
of tobacco should be smoked untill the last possible puff, because the pipe
tobacco doesn't loose its flavour, like others do. He also suggests that a
fine coating of honey on the inside of the bowl helps the development of a
uniform cake on new pipes. I suggest that you trim your uneven cakes, using
a pipe rimmer, and rub a 'very thin' coating of honey around the inside of
the bowl, covering the heels and side walls.  I did this with my older pipes
and worked just fine. If you never trimmed your pipe bowls before, let me
know. I did many times and could help with some hints.

Good luck !

[Here's some mail you sent about Hacker's book. Never let it be said
that your hard-working moderator is less than totally diligent. It's
true, just don't let it be said! :-9 If this isn't the letter you
meant, let me know and I'll try to dig it out of my mailbox. -S.]

    About the Hacker's book, I bought it in Lake Placid. They have an
excellent pipe shop called 'With Pipes and Books'. It is worthy to
spend a weekend in Lake Placid just to visit the shop, and of course,
buy a new pipe. Besides the Adirondack region is really beautiful. I
have the address at home and will send you later on a separate
message. I am sure you can mail order it from them. I truly recommend
the book. It is fun reading, and full of valuable information about
pipe smoking. From the book I got the address of Peter Dunn who runs
the Cotterie of Pipe Smokers and is the editor of the Ephemeris. I
sent him a letter and he sent me a copy of the Ephemeris. I will send
his address along with the pipe shop in Lake Placid.

[Both the book and the shop sound worthwhile. Do others have tales of
their favorite tobacco shops? (I've been looking for a good one in
central NJ, without much luck so far.) -S.]

Subject: Pipes Digest for March 16, 1989

Hi! I thought I'd start off by passing some addresses to you:

	Tom Dunn
	The Universal Coterie of Pipe Smokers
	20-37 120th St.
	College Point, NY 11356

Tom puts out a witty and informative newsletter called "The Pipe
Smoker's Ephemeris" on an irregular basis, and in general acts as a
focal point for pipe smokers, Sherlockians, hobbits, and others of
similar persuasion. The newsletter is free (he sent it to me for
years, no questions asked!), but a donation would be nice. TPSE/TUCOPS
is the largest and most worthwhile group of pipe aficionados I know.

	International Association of Pipe Smokers' Clubs
	17 Midline Road
	Ballston Lake, NY 12019

Honestly, I don't know how active the IAPSC is; I tried to contact
the local chapter for Philadelphia while I lived there, and never got
an answer. You may have better luck, though; it's worth a stamp.

	Pipe Collectors International, Inc.
	6172 Airways Blvd.
	Box 22085
	Chattanooga, TN 37422

I have just learned of this group, and wrote to them last week; I'll
let you know the results. Also look for a mini-review of one of the
popular tobacco blends, as soon as I decide on one (probably by
stochastic processes, aka random guess :-9

Smoke in peace,

~\U Steve.

Subject:      a posting

Steve, please edit this and send it across the mailing list.  Thanks!

Hi there, everybody.  I just got my first pipe (an English "rum
cake"), and so far the only tobacco I've smoked has been "Mystique",
which I believe is the tobacconist's own blend.  Could anyone post or
e-mail to me the names of several mild, sweet tobaccos that would be
available in a pipe shop?  I'm still new at this and don't know where
to start.  Thanks.

Andy
Acknowledge-To: &lt;DICJ$??@??????&gt;

[Personally, I like non-aromatic tobaccos the best, but I might
mention a couple of suggestions. When I started smoking, I used
Amphora Mild Aromatic, a cavendish mixture. It _is_ mild, as long as
you smoke slowly, but most tobaccos don't stay mild if you're puffing
furiously!  You might also check out Captain Black or Borkum Riff,
which are both strongly aromatic. Someone mentioned Cherry Cavendish
(not sure if this is the brand name!) a while back, too.

By the way, congratulations on your new pipe! Hope you both become
good friends. -S.]

Subject: MacBaren Latakia

[editor at work]

Changing the subject to what is really important for mankind, pipes of
course: I saw today a tinbox of tobacco by MacBaren which I didn't buy, but
will soon. It's called just Latakia. I've tried MacBaren before and it is
quite strong. It's a Dannish company. Anyway, I will try it and pass my
impressions to the group.

Have a good smoke.

Elias Mazur.

[Looking forward to it. -S.]

Subject: Types of tobaccos.
Status: R


Dear pipe smokers fellows:

After smoking a bowl of Dunhill Night Cap in a recently acquired italian pipe,
there was nothing left for me to do except to sit by the terminal and give a
small contribution to our mailgroup.

In a recent mail exchange with Steve, and after noticing the interest of some
of the members of the group about different types of tobaccos and their
properties, I am sending a brief glossary of the most common types of tobaccos
available. Most of the information was taken from the book of Richard Hacker,
The Ultimate Pipe Book, but I'll try to give my own impressions about the
tobaccos I've tried myself.

Virginia: grown mostly in North and South Carolina (not in Virginia as one
might expect), it is a commonly bright yellow tobacco, being that the reason
why they are referred to as 'Bright', although dark Virginia does exist.
Bright Virginia has a pleasantly sweet, woodsy taste, making it very popular
in blended tobaccos. Used in moderation provides a superb flavor to almost any
blend. Be careful, though, for too much Virginia will tend to burn 'hot'. I
know of two blends of pure Virginia: one is the Dunhill Virginia blend, which
is more of an English oriented taste, for obvious reasons (it is a Dunhill),
and the other is the MacBaren Virginia #1, which I just bought a tin can last
week. It is a long matured tobacco, with a very distinctive and original
taste.

Burley:  
light yellowish green to yellow-brown in color, it is a extremely light
tobacco. It has almost no taste itself, but absorbs the flavorings added to
aromatic tobacco. Very popular for that reason. MacBaren has a blend called
Burley; I haven't tried, but will soon.

Latakia: grown in northern Syria, this oriental tobacco is usually very
expensive. It is dark brown, almost black in color.  Latakia produces a very
rich, heavy taste, and is usually found in most quality English mixtures
(which I favor unconditionally). I usually buy pure Latakia to mix with other
tobaccos, like Half-and-Half, which is half Virginia and half Burley. I liked
the mixture and hope that some pipe smokers fellows will try it too.

Perique: 
very rare, slow burning, strong-tasting, it is only grown in a small area of
Louisiana. It is the opposite of Burley. Should never be smoked by itself, or
we will probably loose one member of our mailgroup. When mixed with skills, it
produces a very distinctive taste. Dunhill has one mixture called 'Elizabethan
Mixture', which contains a bit of perique. I've tried it and encourage those
who like English mixtures, or those willing to try, to do so.

Maryland:
grown in Maryland, it is of rich brown color, and is used with the same
purpose as of Burley. I never tried this kind of tobacco. If someone did,
please let us know about it.

Turkish:
it is a broad classification of a variety of tobaccos that are actually grown
in Greece. It is of good quality and burns evenly.  They are rarely used in
pipes, but can be found in some of the more exotic blends. I once bought a
blend called Turkish from a store in Boston at Harvard square (I forgot the
name, but it is a quite famous pipe store), and really enjoyed it.  I think I
will have to plan a trip to Boston to get more of that superb blend.

Cavendish: a generic term for tobacco that have been flavored with some kind
of external flavor, such as sugar, maple or rum, and then heated and pressed
in recurring cycles. There are a dozen different types of Cavendish. I don't
know much about the history of Cavendish, but (please correct me if I'm
wrong), Cavendish was an English admiral that during his trips used to mix his
tobacco with rum in the ship.  The best Cavendish in my opinion is the dutch
blend Amphora red pouch (there is also blue and green cans and pouch). I have
tried a number of different Cavendish, but lately I've been favoring English
blends.

Well, I hope that this will help some of our pipe smokers fellows in the
group. I have been smoking pipe for over 7 years and the suggestion I have as
long as tobacco is concerned is: try them. This is the best way of really
knowing about them. And if you don't like one particular blend, try it again
years from now. You might be surprise.

Have all a pleasant and peaceful smoke. (with good tobacco, of course)

Elias Mazur.   ~\U

Subject: Pipes Digest #7 (April 3, 1989)

If anyone here is near Princeton, I'd recommend that you stop in at John
David, Ltd. in the Quakerbridge Mall. It's not just a run-of-the-mall
smokeshop; John and his son know their tobacco (which I admit I'm a bit
ignorant about, but people like Elias and Bill are educating me!) and are
almost embarrasingly helpful. 

John turned me on to African, which he had used as the major component of an
English blend. (I think there was also some Virginia and just a small shade
of Latakia.) African has a "naturally sweet" taste - I didn't know what that
meant, and asked. Later, as I was walking around the mall puffing away on my
full-bent Peterson, I discovered that there was a sweet taste to the smoke;
not overpowering, but present. Quite nice, after some of the heavy blends
I'd been smoking for the past couple of weeks. (I also noticed that I was
being "given the eye" by some rather attractive young ladies, which was also
pleasant! Perhaps many women still do enjoy the smell of a pipe. :-9

Also this week, I got a reply from Pipe Collectors International, and sent
away for a year's subscription. They publish a bimonthly tabloid newsletter,
and sponsor a convention and some local swap meets. The $15/year they charge
certainly seems reasonable; I'll let you know how the newsletter is, and
post their cover letter in a later Pipes Digest. Until next time, then,

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #6 (March 27, 1989)

In Digest #6, Elias Mazur gives an excellent rundown of various sorts
of tobaccos:

&gt;Burley:  
&gt;light yellowish green to yellow-brown in color, it is a extremely light
&gt;tobacco. It has almost no taste itself, but absorbs the flavorings added to
&gt;aromatic tobacco. Very popular for that reason. 

I take it, then, that most Cavendishes are Burley ?

&gt;Latakia: grown in northern Syria, this oriental tobacco is usually very
&gt;expensive. It is dark brown, almost black in color.  Latakia produces a very
&gt;rich, heavy taste, and is usually found in most quality English mixtures
&gt;(which I favor unconditionally). I usually buy pure Latakia to mix with other
&gt;tobaccos, like Half-and-Half, which is half Virginia and half Burley. I liked
&gt;the mixture and hope that some pipe smokers fellows will try it too.

Latakia also produces a rather, er, um, "distinctive" aroma. 8-)  (I'm
politely trying to say "It stinks !" 8-)

Which brings up an issue: how important is the aroma of a tobacco to you ?
I can't really smell the tobacco when I'm smoking it, anyway, though I
would presume the aroma figures into the taste, somewhat.  If I put down
the pipe and leave the room, and return in a few minutes, though, I can
get a whiff.

I place a lot of emphasis on aroma, though, because I don't want to offend
others, particularly non-smokers.  Back in the before-time, when you could
actually walk around a store while smoking, I received more compliments
than complaints by a factor of at least 3:1.  People who won't tolerate
cigar or cigarette smoke will often be glad to let you smoke a pipe; *if*
it doesn't smell like you're burning field mice.  Of course, my job is made
easier in that I really enjoy vanilla cavendishes, while finding English-
style tobaccoes much less pleasant.   I must confess, though, to never
having tried Latakia; actually, I might, now that I'm living alone 8-)

I would suspect those with families are even more concerned about this.

[Nowwaitaminute! I _like_ Latakia! It wasn't even an acquired taste; I liked
it the first time I smoked it. Even if it does smell like incinerated
rodents and induce the neighbors to call the Fire Department. :-9  -S.]

Subject: a new smoking experience

I've just had a unique smoking experience, mango cavendish.
Yes, mango, that ever popular tropical fruit.  I wasn't to supprised at
the taste, considering that it was recommended by my tobaconist, but I
was suprised at its existence.  Pat (proprieter of Jon's Pipe Shop, 
Champaign Illinois) studied under a real master of the craft who specialized
in exotic cavendish's.  Pat still buys from that company today, but with
its late owner's death, the quality has declined somewhat.  The mango
was one of his last products.  Its cut down with something else (probably
vanilla cavendish), and is somewhat lighter than black cavendish, but
not by much.  The taste is delicious, somewhat tart, subtly fruity,
sweet without being cloying.  The experience was the closest I've had
with a flavored tobacco to actually eating the genuine article, it had
the same lightness of taste yet solidity of substance that a real mango
has.

[This sounded so tasty that I wrote to Ami and got Pat's address; he's
sending me some of the mango by mail. I'll let you know how it is. -S.]

Subject: The arrival of the mango

The mango cavendish arrived last week, and I've been smoking it on and
off for about a week. Pat, the proprietor of the pipe shop, didn't
seem in the least surprised to be getting letters from strangers a
thousand miles away asking for strange blends. In fact, he sent me a
rather nice letter on his blending beliefs (which reminds me, I gotta
pay him!! :-9

In any case, the mango cavendish has a pleasant aroma and does,
indeed, taste like a real mango. Because it's cavendish, it burns a
little hot (at least I find that cavendish usually smokes hot). It's
also probably best to smoke this in the first pipe of the day, when
your palate is clear.

Also this week, I found myself with some tobacco and without a pipe,
so I invested in a corncob to keep in the car. The first smoke was,
surprisingly, quite hot! So here's a question: who knows about the
care and feeding of corncobs? Will they always smoke hot?

I hope to hear from y'all soon. Until next time, smoke in peace.

~\U Steve.

I have a new topic, matches.  What are your favorite matches for pipe
smoking?  I prefer Swan Vestas, they are nice wooden matches which end
up costing about 25 cents for a box of 50.  The proper match is very
importants.

Subject: New (old) pipes.

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

     I`m happy to share with you the acquisition of 2 pipes for my collection.
One is a brand new italian pipe from the same pipe maker I got a pipe about 2
months ago. His name is Aldo Velani, and the pipe is really beautiful. It is a
large full bent with a nice straight grain. It was given to me as a birthday
gift by my girlfriend (of course I chose it :-). The other is my first
pre-owned pipe. Is is a Barling made in Denmark by Ole Larsen, from the
transition period of the Barling history. It is straight stem, with mixed
grains. It smokes so cool and smooth, that I could not believe. Maybe that's
the biggest advantage of buying pre-owned pipes: they are great to smoke,
given the wood is old and dry.

    Well, now I'll sit down and smoke one of them (hard decision :-). I'm
preparing a summary of types of grains in pipes, and what we should look for
when buying a new pipe. It will be here soon.

    Smoke in peace. ~\U

    Elias Mazur.

I don't know any trick for tightening stems, but I can suggest that you
contact a good pipe store owner, who can fix your stems, or even put on a new
one. I know of a pipe shop in Utica (I mentioned in previous mails), whose
owner, Mr Bob Smith, is an expert on the subject. He has a large quantity of
new stems, and the know-how. Every time I go to his pipe shop, I take a pipe
with me, so that he can clean the stem. It looks like new !  Anyway, I'm going
to pass you his address and phone number, and you can contact him. I'm sure
you'll be pleased to do business with him.

Deja vu !  Just yesterday, I went to the TB (the only pipe store in
East Columbus open on Sundays...) to try some latakia.  I turned my
nose up at Sherlock's, and picked Connoisseur, which sits right next
to it.

I got two ounces and promised myself not to make a decision until I'd
smoked it all  (to make sure the my pipe cake picks up the full flavor,
after years of smoking flavored cavendish), but my initial impression is
underwhelming.  There is a certain plain, woodsy flavor, which is
pleasant, but that's offset by the smell, which is certainly no crowd
pleaser.  We'll give it a while, yet.

You need to sand down the stem a little, then it should fit fine.  If not,
sand off a little more.

Some stems are too far gone to be recovered, I'm told, so you may find
after a few sandings that the stem literally falls out of the pipe.  In
that case, you'll need a replacment stem.

8-)  8-)   sorry, couldn't resist.

A couple of my hard rubber stems, and one lucite, did the same thing,
giving me to presume that the pipe itself has expanded, as opposed to
the stem loosening.  Anyway, my quick fix (which has been in place for
a year or two now 8-)  was to wrap a small bit of thin paper around the
tip of the stem, to act as a shim.  Experiment with the exact thickness you
need, but one turn is usually sufficient.  Scotch tape works even better,
so long as you carfully clean the stem first.

My greatest pipe repair to date was on a favorite old deep bend (the sort
that bumps your chin as you smoke).  Managed to drop this one, splitting
the pipe neck in half and breaking off the top half:


	-----------
       /           \    /\
      |            |   / x\
      |            |  xxx  /
      |            \_/    /
      \                  /
        \_______________/
where everyinging above and to the left of the x's was broken off.  As the
pipe was a fine smoker, I refused to give up so easily.   I put the too
half back in place (it fitted perfectly, no chips were lost), and
tightly wound that broken area of the neck with wire.  Then, I placed
a bit of heat-shrink tubing over the wire wrap, and with a heat gun,
shrunk it tightly into place.

Sure, it looks funny, but by God, it's held up for over 2 years now !

Subject: Tightening a stem.

When I first started smoking a pipe I was  fortunate  to  find  a
person  in a pipe shop who helped me a great deal and would spend
a lot of time answering my questions.  As much as  "Phil  of  the
Bay  Area"  hates malls, the Bruyere Shoppe at the local mall was
the best store going.  Anyway, back to the  reason  for  posting.
As  a  newcommer  to pipe smoking I tended to smoke the pipe fast
and hot (still do sometimes, but I'm  working  on  it)  and  this
would  cause the shank to expand compressing the stem.  If it did
not crack the shank eventually, the stem  would  get  loose.  The
gentleman  that  I  spoke  of  showed me how to fix this with the
statement, "The first time I'll show you  for  free,  after  that
there  is  a  charge".  This  works  for  the  vulcanized, black,
bowling ball style stems, I don't know about the acrylic.

What he did was to cram as many pipe cleaners into  the  stem  as
would  fit.  Usually  two,  but  I've found that three are needed
sometimes and in other stems only one.  Once  the  pipe  cleaners
are  in  place  and positioned so that they are right against the
opening in the tenon, you take a match or lighter and heat up the
tenon.  This makes the tenon soft.  Be sure not to hold the flame
so that it touches the stem as this might start the stem burning.

When the tenon of the stem is hot  and  becomes  soft,  push  the
tenon  against  the  side of a counter or another flat surface at
the same time keeping the tenon as perpendicular to  the  surface
as  possible.  This  will cause the tenon to bulge just a little,
the pipe cleaners keep the hole open.  As you use this  technique
often, you learn just how much pressure you  can  use  to  get  a
tight fit without giving up much tenon length.  When the stem has
cooled so that it is no longer soft, remove the pipe cleaners and
sand  the tenon down, a little at a time, checking the fit to the
pipe.  To sand, wrap the sandpaper (about 120  grit)  around  the
tenon and turn the stem so that you are removing material  evenly
around  the  tenon.  When  the  tenon  just  fits into the shank,
remove it and cover the tenon surface with  graphite  by  rubbing
with  pencil  lead (this allows the tenon to slide into the shank
easier).

You can do this three or four times, and then it is time to buy a
new stem.

Subject: Cobs and Clays

As several folks have pointed out, corncob and clay pipes are entertaining
bargains.  Both of them start out porous enough that they need little or
no breakin, both are light and easy to carry, both are easy to break or
char, and both are cheap enough so you don't care.

I find the cobs best for pocket pipes to smoke at outdoor sports, on safe spots
on trails (e. g. big rocks), and general casual al fresco adventures.  I
haven't had a clay for a long time and would probably reserve one for St.
Paddy's day.

(Other excellent outdoor smokes include Connecticutt Valley cigars. These
are all-tobacco with fine wrappers and a fairly heavy taste. Judges Cave
is one brand.  I tend to think of them as "cigars ordinaire", the rolled
equivalent of a decent jug red.)

Re: With Pipe and Book

I've received a few back issues of "The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris" from
Tom Dunn, one of which mentioned a store in Lake Placid, NY called,
"With Pipe and Book." They carry a variety of pipe books, including
some which are rather difficult to find, and which I've wished for for
years (Carl Ehwa's book on pipes and tobaccos, Ben Rappaport's book on
collecting, several Dunhill books, and about 50 or 60 more!) Their
address, for those who are also curious, is:

	With Pipe and Book
	Breck &amp; Julia Turner, Proprietors
	91 Main St.
	Lake Placid, NY 12946

The store's name comes from a poem which they print in their pamphlet,
and which I quote here, for those who hack at close of day.

With Pipe and Book at close of day,
Oh what is sweeter, mortal, say?
It matters not what book on knee,
Old Izaak or the Odyssey,
It matters not meerschaum or clay.

And though one's eyes will dream astray,
And lips forget to sue or sway,
It is "enough to merely be"
	With Pipe and Book.

What though our modern skies be gray,
As bards aver, I will not pray
For "soothing Death" to succor me,
But ask this much, O Fate, of thee,
A little longer yet to stay
	With Pipe and Book.

		- Richard de Gallienne.

Subject: Reviving Old Tobacco

A few days ago, thinking I'd run out of my usual tobacco (the Tinder Box's
"Sherlock's Choice" blend, a terrible name for a delightful smoke), I 
opened the jar where I keep the dog-ends of tobaccos I've either lost
interest in or simply didn't like.  In the jar I found some Sir Walter
Raleigh, some Prince Albert (yes, in a can), and a couple of other
Tinder Box blends, Skilling and Philosopher, both 7-10 years old and
DRY, but offering more promise than their drug store alternatives.

The Skilling bag contained just enough to recharge my pouch, and the
Philosopher bag rather more.  So, I moistened a humidifier button with
Cognac, and dropped it in the pouch with the Skilling.  I'd never
previously tried anything but water as a humidifier, but I was amazed
by the results -- that ancient tobacco is actually very good, now!

Have I stumbled on something that pipe smokers have known for years?

Subject: More on British Blending


Puffers wishing to try a range of British-style tobaccoes might try the ones
sold under the "Rattray's" brand. (They're actually Scottish.  No offense
meant to anyone involved in _that_ eternal debate. :-))

They range from very heavy, almost chewy-tasting, Latakia-loaded
blends (Rattray's Black Mallory) to tasty midweights (Rattray's
Red Rapparee) to plain Virginia blends (No. 7;  Accountant's Mixture).

My favorites are the No. 7 and the Red Rapparee, which I may be spelling
wrong.  It's fun telling people I'm smoking "Rrrratrray's Rrrred
Rrrrapparrree," too.  The Accountant's mixture is good, too, but
almost like smoking "Lawyer's Mixture" as far as name appeal goes. :-)

[Aside on aromatics: On tobacco choices, of course, chacun a son gout
asolutement.  But whenever I smoke a heavily dosed aromatic, I think
of the high school chemistry demo where the teacher burns sugar by
pouring acid on it, releasing great clouds of steam and piles of
graphite.  I keep imagining that's what's going on in my pipe.

On the other hand, smoking Latakia blends is often a solitary 
pleasure. De gustibus, to drag in yet another language.]

Subject: Degrees, cohabs, and four pipe books.

Dear Pipefriends,

This week is a rather signifigant one in a few ways! First, I've finished
all the things one must endure to extract a Master's in computer science
from the State University of New Jersey (a place with many things to be
circumspect about, but which did NOT incorrectly verify cold fusion!) Which
leads to a question: would you have any recommendations on a "reward pipe"
for making it all the way through? I've got somewhere in the neighborhood of
$50 to play with, though I'm not bound to this amount.

More importantly here, I'm very relieved about one thing. I'm about to lose
a roommate whose first reaction when I lit my pipe was to whine, "Are you
*smoking*?" Thereafter, he sprayed the hall with ozone-depleting chemicals
each time I lit up, regardless of how careful I was that my smoke did not
impinge upon his twitching nostrils. I shan't mourn his passing, for this
and other reasons. (Fellow hedonists, have you any advice on how to deal
with similar ninnies in the future? I'm [ugh] sure I'll need it.)

The top story in the pipe news: I've received four books from "With Pipe and
Book", a tobacconist and book dealer in upstate New York on which Elias and
I have both commented. One of the books I purchased is, of course, Richard
Hacker's "Ultimate Pipe Book", a witty and informative tome well worth the
$18.95 or so. I wrote Mr.  Hacker directly, by the way, and was informed
that there will be a new edition, fully revised, appearing in September.
Those who are in need of Christmas presents might take note!

Also in the box from Lake Placid were Carl Ehwa's "Book of Pipes and
Tobaccos" and Ben Rappaport's "Complete Guide to Collecting Antique Pipes."
I haven't had time to completely absorb either of these volumes yet, but
rest assured I shall. Ehwa's book has an excellent section on tobacco
culture.

Last is Mary Dunhill's "Our Family Business", her insider's view of the
Dunhill firm and how its founding family built it. The book is candid in the
extreme about the Dunhills' family life, which at times appears to have been
most unhappy; not too much hard information on pipe crafting or the modern
firm's operations. A worthwhile read, though I'd recommend against buying it
outright.

A note to the Bay Area and New England members! "The Ultimate Pipe Book"
lists a couple of pipe-related restaurants:

- Pipe Dream Restaurant
  Rte. 32 and Ademac Rd.
  W. Willington, Ct. 06729
  "Their briar-inspired desserts will light-up your tastebuds."
  [Briar-inspired desserts??? -S.]

- S. Holmes, Esq.
  "221B Baker Street"
  Holiday Inn, Union Square
  Sutter at Powell Streets
  San Francisco, CA
  "A lifesized diorama of Holmes' sitting room and individually reserved
  calabashes for regular patrons make this drinking saloon a Sherlockian's
  delight."

(Keen's English Chop House in NYC used to operate on a similar principle -
they reserved a clay pipe for all their regulars. News from the New York
Pipe Club (Sailorman Jack, 212-288-3832) is that they don't allow smoking in
their dining room! :-( But if anyone can check out the "Pipe Dream" or
"221B", the group would greatly appreciate the effort, I'm sure!)

Well, that's about it for this time. Please write in if you've any wisdom to
share, and until next time, may your bowls be dry and your smoke rings round.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Well, I've heard of people using chunks cut from apples as humidifier
buttons;  I was told that neither this nor potatos was a good idea, 
though; they tend to mold quickly, and take your tobacco with them,
I guess.

But cognac ?   I can understand flavoring tobacco with an aromatic
alcohol, but does it have to be *French* ?  8-)



Degrees, cohabs, and four pipe books.

Our beloved benefactor, Steve Masticola, writes:

Congrat's on the degree, Steve !  On now for the Phud, or are you

I've had several bizarre roommates in this regard.  For example, when I was
living in the dorms, I requested a "smoking" room (the OSU Residence and
Dining halls tried to accommodate smoking/non-smoking preferences), but
ended up with one roommate who didn't smoke and, in fact, really disliked 
the smell of smoke  (and I only smoked nicely aromatic stuff, too).  I
gather that some people just can't stand tobacco aroma, regardless of
flavoring.  We compromised;  I kept smoking, and he put up with it. 8-)
I never felt guilty, either;  in exchange, I didn't complain about
*his* smoking (of a certain, er, "hard-to-find" tobacco substitute).  I
did once comment to him that his grass would probably smoke smoother if
he kept it in a humidor... 8-)


After that, I moved in with roommates who I'd checked before and liked the
smell of my pipe.  We actually had a quasi-smoking policy;  my pipe was
OK, but no cigarettes allowed.


Finally, I moved in with a friend I'd known for years.   A week after
moving in, he made the comment that he like me more than he disliked my
pipe, but would I please not smoke in the living room ?  Grrr...  I
did avoid it, to an extent, but if I had a lit pipe and needed to go there,
I didn't worry about it.

Some people are funny that way.  One friend told me after several years
that my smoking gave him headaches;  if he'd told me in the first place, 
I'd have gladly not smoked around him.  When it used to be possible to
walk through a store with a lit pipe, three times as many people used to
compliment me on the smell of my pipe as would complain about it;  of
course, that doesn't count the people who stand upwind from you at a 
bus stop and make those silly little coughing noises 8-)

Congratulations, Steve!!

You might consider buying a "Brebbia" brand pipe.  These are Italian jobbies,
and apparently very popular and respected over there.  They're at about the
same quality level as Bari pipes, which is to say very good.  But they've
been widely distributed (at least around here) for only the last year or so,
they don't have a famous name yet, and you could probably find a decent one
in your price rance.

They have some interesting shapes, to me anyway. They tend to alter traditional
contours just enough to add interest without being gaudy.  Their trademark is
a diagonal slash of briar on the stem -- quite nice.

Remember that most manufacturers sell different "quality ranges" of pipes.
They often don't know which range a pipe will be in until it's finished --
the last stroke of sandpaper on a bowl can reveal a damaging flaw.

So the same production line will yield a perfect pipe with fine grain ($200),
one with good grain and a few nicks ($100), and one with one or more filled-in
flaws ($50).  It's clear where the cost-effective end of this curve is.

Pipes that don't turn out well at all are often sold under lesser names.
Ehrlich's in Boston used to have big bins of "Boston Briars" for a
dollar or two.  These were factory seconds of who knows what and were
great deals. I still have a couple.

Anent Martin Lodahl's experience: one great thing about tobacco is that is
just doesn't spoil (outside freaky cases, like mildew).  Old weed can 
almost always be resuscitated by a few hours or days in a humid environment.
I've never tried wakening up the flavor with booze but it sounds great.
Cigars with the puffing end dipped in Remy Martin --- yum!

[Cigar aside -- old cigars get crumbly.  If a cigar in a store makes
crackly noises as you roll it gently between your fingers, don't buy
it.  If one you've already bought does, take it _out_ of the cellophane
and leave it in your humididor for a few days.  It will be fine.]

A big, maduro Partagas sounds like a great present for oneself, too.

Subject: Jersey shops and new members of the family

Thanks for the help, Bill and Phil! (To answer Bill's question, I'm going
for a Ph.D [Ph.Ool. though I may be!])

Last week, I did a little exploring of the tobacco shops in North Jersey,
and got some good news after a fairly long trek. 

I first checked out "Mr. Pipe" at Woodbridge Plaza. Not too impressive. It's
a small mall pipe store which seems to be in business mostly to sell
cigarettes and lottery tickets (a common practice among local smokeshops).
They haven't paid much attention to making a fussy, dallying pipe shopper
(such as myself) feel at home. They had some quality pipes for sale, but
these were mostly either far behind the counter or in a display case in
front of the cash register, where I seemed sure to be trampled by
lottery-ticket buyers. I didn't stay long.

The next day I went to "John David" in Quaker Bridge Mall, a store I've
described here before. The owner was attentive, but his stock seemed devoid
of middle-of-the-line pipes (I wanted one without fills, though I was willing
to tolerate some surface defects) and didn't seem to digress beyond basic
shapes I already had. Conversation:

ME:	Do you have any freehands?
OWNER:	Well, _all_ our pipes are freehands, except for maybe the cheap
	ones which are made by machine. This Dunhill is a freehand, this
	Upshall is a freehand... But for fifty bucks, you're not going to
	get a freehand pipe without fills.
ME:	I meant Danish freehands.
OWNER:	Oh, you're looking for something _wild_. I don't have any Danish
	freehands on hand; they don't sell. But I can order one. Here, let
	me show you the catalog. (Shows me a picture of a spectacularly 
	garish Preben Holm.) 
ME:	That's a bit _too_ wild for me.
OWNER:	Well, there are some Petersons over here. Petersons are always a
	good buy. [I agree, but...]
ME:	But I already have two Petersons. I don't need another one.
OWNER:	Not wild enough? Okay, but believe me, for fifty bucks you're not
	going to get a pipe without fills.
ME:	(Suddenly realizing that he was, after all, operating his shop in
	close proximity to Princeton) I'll just look on my own.

Nothing particularly caught my eye there, so I moved on.

The last place I visited was, of course, where I hit the jackpot.  Oddly
enough, this was a "Tinder Box" recently moved from Brunswick Square Mall to
a storefront on Route 18. The move, IMHO, was the kiss of death - no foot
traffic, difficult to see the store from the road, even harder to get into
or out of the parking lot, and no lottery concession for months! Rush hour
was already pressing at 4 P.M., but I decided to chance a visit.

The attendant (a youth who didn't appear too savvy about pipes - he asked me
if I was interested in a "messerschaum") immediately offered me a 50 percent
discount on any pipe on the shelf. I decided to taste (or at least observe)
his wares, and spent about half an hour having him move pipes into and out
of his display case. (His setup was like "Mr. Pipe", but I was the only
customer in the store while I was there.) I finally narrowed my selection
down to an Italian "Mauro Armellini" quarter-bent cone with a spherical top
(something like a briar Calabash) and a Danish "Bjarne" full-bent pot with a
narrow mouth on the bowl. Both had bite-proof Lucite stems; although I saw
some diminishingly small sand pits and crevices, neither had any apparent
fills. The total price with the discount was $87.50, but the youth offered
them both for $75, no tax, and with some tobacco thrown in! I accepted, and
received a double reward and a pouch of "Sherlock's." I'd heartily recommend
that New Jersey smokers check this place out - before they get the lotto
machine!

After about three pipefuls, the "Armellini" and I are good friends. (And how
nice to be able to smoke at home, without "Felix Unger" and his spraycan! :-)
The "Bjarne" remains unsmoked; perhaps I'll open a good book and get
acquainted with her tonight. One of these days I'll go procure a Partagas,
though I'm not a frequent cigar smoker. 

Until next time, pipefriends,

					Smoke in peace,

(re: visit to the Tinder Box)

&gt;The attendant (a youth who didn't appear too savvy about pipes - he asked me

Well, aren't you ?   Most people would kill for one !

The youth of today may have forgotten that time in 1940, the Blitz,
when the dreaded Messerchaums ruled the skies over Britain.  These
deadly German fighter pipes were the scourge of the Royal Pipe Force,
and left ashes wherever they went.   The Germans had something of a
technological advantage, of course; fueled by high-octane Turkish tobaccos,
the Messerschaums smoked faster than the more traditional English Spitfires,
and packed a tremendous bite; as a drawback, this fuel made the Messer's
easier to light.

Of course, the tides were finally turned by the arrival of the Americans;
our Pipe-38 (Lighter) , P-47 (Thunderburl), and P-51 (Mouthsting)
were more than a match for for anything the Germans could carve.  The few
remaining Messerschaums are real collectors' items, though I've heard
they're difficult to smoke in a tailwind.

Subject: Messerschaums

In the last Pipes Digest, someone noted that the clerk at a local Tinder
Box offered to sell him a "messerschaum."  I'm astounded that any
pipe afficianado would turn one down !

Maybe kids today are too young to remember back to those frightening days
of 1940, when the dreaded Messerschaums ruled the skies over Britain. A
failing of our educational system, no doubt...

For those unfamiliar, the Messerschaum was Germany's premier fighting pipe
in the early years of WWII.  Its light construction and excellent cooling
properties enabled it to smoke high-octane Turkish tobaccos, which
generally burned too hot for the more conventional English briars.  The
result was a fast-smoking pipe, highly maneuverable, but dangerously easy
to light.  Despite the latter failing, it was clearly superior to the older
British fighting pipes.

The only possible English counter was to increase the Latakia content
of their tobaccos, and to smoke these high-test mixtures in the aptly-named
Spitfire which, while nearly the equal of the German pipe, was extremely
uncomfortable to smoke; pilots had to have periodic time off to recover
from 3rd degree tongue burns.  Doggedly, though, the Royal Aromatics Force
fought off the Pipewaffe, until America's entry into the war added
thousands of modern pipes to the British arsenal.  The Germans were finally
beaten when the bombing of the Rumanian tobacco fields near Ploesti
deprived them of their powerful fuel, forcing them to use lower grades
of homegrown, poorly aged and blended.o

Truly, though, that  dark time, when Britain alone stood in the face of
the Nazi blitz, was British smokers' Finest Hour.

	With the coming summer I was wondering whether anybody had a
	particularly favorite outdoor smoke.  

Well, I did, anyway - "Bean's Mixture", from L. L. Bean himself! In fact,
for a long time this was my favorite smoke. Bean's no longer sells it, and I
have only a small sample left. I heard somewhere (here? the Ephemeris?)
about a tobacconist who can duplicate any blend, given a sample; I'll have
to get on the stick and re-locate this shop.

In general, though, I'd tend to prefer natural or light-aromatic tobacco.
Scanning through "The Ultimate Pipe Book", a mixture of Virginia (for
flavor) and long-cut Burley and/or Maryland might be nice. Perhaps you could
get all three and run an experiment!


		And now for something completely different...


Thanks to Bill for his, as usual, insightful comments on the Messerschaum
fighter pipes. Bill, unfortunately you forgot to mention the Messerschaum
ME-262, the world's first jet pipe. 

The ME-262, produced toward the end of the war, had a top speed of an
astonishing 400 bowls per hour and could blow rings around any fighter pipe
then on the Allies' drawing boards. Due to the high G(unk) loads, pilots of
the ME-262 had to tape their tongues to keep from blacking out in the fierce
fire of battle. The ME-262 had nothing to fear from Allied fighterpipes;
dozens of American B-29 Smokerfortress bomber pipes never made it back to
their home racks when they encountered the Messerschaum jets.

Fortunately for the Allies, Nazi dictator Adolph Bitler decreed that the
ME-262 would be used as a bomber rather than a fighter. The tiny two ounces
of Perique explosive that the Messerschaum jets could carry in their
bomb-bowls was no threat to the Allied Forces. Soon after Bitler's fateful
decision, Allied high-altitude daylight precision smoking stemmed ME-262
production, and shortages of high-nicotine Latakia fuel from Ploesti spelled
its final demise.

Smokorsky to the jungles of Vietnam and the devastating, giant "Gooey"
helipipeter gunkship.

Now, really...

From the _Ephemeris_, kind of with permission, a bit about pipe smoking in
the Battle of Britain.

"I flew many missions as wingman to the group commander, Col. Henry Spicer,
a daring pilot with bristling mustaches, who loved to dogfight and could
care less about personal risks. Spicer smoked a big briar pipe, and on the
return home, he always dropped down to below 12,000 feet, unhooked his
oxygen mask, and had himself a smoke. As his wingman, I dropped down with
him right over Paris. German flak guns began pounding at us, but I could see
Spicer in his cockpit tamping his tobacco and lighting his Zippo. We were
practically over the rooftops when the tracers flashed by my canopy. I spoke
into my mike: 'Christ, Colonel Spicer, we're gonna get shot down.' I saw him
chuckle through a cloud of pipe smoke. 'Relax, laddie,' he replied. 'Those
bastards couldn't hit a billboard.' Colonel Spicer was later shot down by a
burst of white flak near the French coast, after he had descended to 12,000
feet to light that damned pipe. He bailed out over the channel, but the
Germans picked him up."

- From _Yeager_, by General Chuck Yeager and Leo Janos.


Also see _Reach for the Sky_ by Paul Brickhill, about Wing Commander Douglas
Bader, the legendary legless British ace. Bader also liked to smoke his pipe
in the cockpit, but had different ideas about what was dangerous - he smoked
while he was on oxygen, a serious fire hazard. Like Spicer, Bader was also
shot down and captured by the Germans (and attempted escape twice, despite
having no legs!) Conclusive proof - pipe smokers have character!


Enough war stories! Please send me something peaceful! Until next time,

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

Subject: Carving the pipe


Well the first pipe has been carved and is almost sanded to a smooth
luster.  It is not like most pipes that I have ever seen.  Since I
do not own a lathe it has straight lines instead of curved.  If you
imagine a cube and cut a small amount from the four corners to make
an uneven octagon you may imagine what this pipe looks like.  I cheated
with this one where the tobacco hole and the shank were already machined
for me.  I have two more completely blank briars awaiting my saw and file.
Does anyone have comments on pipes with straight lines rather than curved?

Subject: Pipe carving; OTJ enjoyment

Thanks for the note, Norm! I've seen pipes with bowls shaped like octagonal
prisms from time to time, but this seems to be a relatively unexplored form
compared to free-form or lathe-made designs. IMHO, there are two basic
requirements for any pipe design: it should be pleasant to smoke and to hold
in the hand (and in the mouth if its bowl is reasonably sized.)  Beyond
that, anything that pleases is OK! (Wish there were a way we could all see
your efforts, Norm!)

Most designs seem to be going for interesting visual forms, but some try for
kinesthetically pleasant pipes (how's that for a $0.65 word!) I have a Ben
Wade "Hand Pipe", which is a large Danish free-form with at least three
comfortable grip positions designed in. Not too good for driving (it's large
and heavy, and I tend to clamp the pipe in my mouth so I have both hands
free for gestures 8-), but very pleasant to smoke when reading or talking.

Sometimes I've wondered why no one gets into making regular polyhedral or
geodesic designs. It would probably take quite a lot of skill with a bandsaw
or sander to do something like that, but I believe you'd get a satisfying
and unusual design if you could do it. Maybe I'll try it when I have access
to a good wood shop.

				---

Second topic: I was wondering how many of the pipefolk on the net are still
allowed to light up on the job? Are there still places where a pipe is OK as
a stimulus to thought? Have you had problems with coworkers, and if so how
have you resolved them? Perhaps there are still places that are tolerant
enough to allow their employees to puff at work (as long as they're not
smoking Buffalo Chip Aromatic!) If you have any tales to tell, good or ill,
please let us know. And tune in next time, same pipe-time, same
pipe-channel!

Subject: Congratulations, help and of course, pipes...

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

   I would like to apologize for not being active in our group for
such a long time.  These past weeks have been pretty busy, and crazy, but
thanks to the peace of mind that my pipes always provide me, I didn't
get any serious stress.  Well, I would like to congratulate my friend
Steve (a little late of course) for the completion of the degree, and
wish him good luck in his persuit for his Ph.D. I'm sure that your new
pipes will help you through those long nights of research and writing the
dissertation. I hope we could all meet and celebrate, with our
favorite pipes along. (Maybe I just planted a seed for the future
meeting of our pipe group. Ideas ???).

I am also finishing my Master's degree, and will be defending my
thesis two weeks from today. Of course I was going to buy myself a new
pipe as the graduation gift 'after' the defense, but yesterday I saw a
beautiful Ben-Wade free-hand with an oustanding straight grain and did
not resist. I bought it, and in a few minutes will be lighting my new
friend for the first time.

My graduation, although something long awaited for, poses a serious
threat on my participation in our pipe group; unlike my friend Steve,
I am not going to continue towards the PhD, and therefore implies that
I have to find a job. I've been looking for a while, but with no
success. Last week I had a couple of interviews, but nothing yet.  The
problem is that if I don't find a job I'll probably go back to Brazil,
which means I won't be able to communicate anymore with the group.
For all these reasons I am asking the group for some help.  If someone
knows of a position for software engineering in the graphics/image
processing field, or any area that requires C programming or
assembler, and would like to have a pipe smoker fellow to puff a nice
bowl of the favorite tobacco with, I would really appreciate any
contacts you might have. Please contact me if you need my resume.


Smoke in peace. ~\U

Elias Mazur.

Subject: Carving

There was an article in Better Homes and Garden's Wood magazine
about a year ago on pipe carving.  From my recollection of the
article the rounded bowls were not made using a lathe, but just
carefully carved in that shape.

The magazine only comes out quarterly, so you ought to be able
to dig up a copy.

Subject: Smoking at Work and Eating Out

I could probably get away with an occasional pipe on the job, but I
don't bother.  I haven't smoked at work for six years or so
and don't miss it.  Since this is balmy Northern California,
I do occasionally nip out to the courtyard with some reading material
and a pipe or cigar.  There's no phone, nobody grouses, and I learn something
or plan something.  This would be less satisfactory, I think, in
Minnesota in January or Houston in August.

I also usually choose to eat in no-smoking sections.
Eating good food, smoking good tobacco, riding my bicycle, and 
having sex are all great pleasures, but some of them don't mix.
Food and tobacco seem to cancel each other's pleasures out.

Smoking between courses is barbaric.
I've never even tried sex on a bicycle.

Subject: Where to Smoke, and Suffering Sphincters

Most of the time I'm pretty polite about not smoking around people who
find it unpleasant.  The only places that are universally OK are my own
turf (house and car), an occasional bar, and outdoors.  At other people's
homes, I'll light up only on the porch or deck unless I'm specifically invited
to smoke indoors.

These policies have for the most part avoided any hassles about when and
where I smoke.  Every so often, though, things get annoying.

Last March, I was waiting for a later plane at the Pheonix airport.  I
had an hour to kill, plenty to read, and a $3 Partagas cigar.  I care-
fully found the designated smoking area, found a chair distant from
most other smokers (I don't care for cigarette smoke, though I'm far from
being a Nazi about it), at lit up.

A party of five or so came up and stood _directly_under_the_"Designated_
Smoking_Section"_sign_.  They were complaining about the temperature, about
the late plane, about this, about that, and about my smoking.  Not directly
to me. You know. Gagging noises, "This SMOKE is AWFUL," and so forth.  These
clowns came to the one area in the entire lobby specifically set aside for
my hobby and started howling.  They could have moved twenty yards in
any direction and found a no-smoking spot.  But they preferred to @#$% and
moan.

I thought of confronting them, but I was in too good a mood.  I leaned back
and puffed harder.  I made smoke rings.  They got madder and went away.

IMHO,it's good for the psyche and the blood pressure to assume that you
will run into three or four (ahem) sphincters a day.  That way when you bump
into one, you just cross him off that day's list.  On good days, you still
have one or two left over.  That was the first time I had worked my way through
my whole day's ration before noon.

From: Steve Masticola (????????@????.???????.???)
Subject: A meeting proposal, and some rejoinders

Elias, congratulations on your new Ben Wade and good luck on your Master's
defense (may the one help the other!) Also, good luck in your search for a
job. I'm sure we all hope you'll be able to stay on the net. Ladies and
gentlemen, if you have some job info for our esteemed founder, please let
him know.  (I will!)

Also, to follow up on Elias's suggestion, I'd like to propose a meeting at
the New York Pipe Club for their next meeting (the first Tuesday in July,
which would be the 4th --- no, that can't be right, I'll have to call.) I'll
let you know the details the next Digest.

Phil's notes about smoking etiquette pretty much parallel my opinions.
Before I went to grad school (when I worked for a living :-), I used to nip
out to the car at lunchtime for a briar and a book. When the car got too
hot, I found a grassy, secluded spot near the plant which was ideal for such
things ( except for some random poison ivy, which I never quite wanted to
try to smoke 8-O ) Not to belabor the point, but the airport scene you
described makes me think that there should be a statement of good manners
for both smokers and nonsmokers. I may concoct one, if someone else hasn't
already written it!

Working at the computer seems like the perfect occasion to smoke, so I often
light up when I'm at home. It helps me to concentrate quite a bit, besides
giving me something to chew on, other than junk food (or a good, meaty
problem!) But that's my own space, and I do without at school or work.

An update on Rick Shoopak's question about summer blends: I just got a
brochure about some blends from Robert McConnell in London. The firm has
been around for 150 years, and are "hand-blended, stem-free, and
glycol-free." They recently became available in the U.S. after some absence.
If you can find a shop that sells them, the "Maduro Superb" and "Special
London Fine Cut" look like what I'd want for a summer smoke - mild, but
tasty. (I'll be looking too!) 

If you'd like to get a copy of McConnell's brochure, send a self-addressed
stamped envelope to:

	W. N. Powers and Co.	(Ref: Summer '87 - Spring '88 _Ephemeris_).
	14026 Leadwell St.
	Van Nuys, CA 91405

Finally, a comment on Phil's note on smoking proximate to eating - it works
both ways, according to Gayl Liebman, also in the last _Ephemeris_. Here's
what she's got to say:

[Regarding a brochure from "Tobacco Express", Box 25773, Lexington, KY 40524]

"... I have also gained insight as well into the role digestion plays on
smoking, proving one is never too old to learn something new. It took the
form of learning which tobaccos to smoke when, depending on one's diet. For
example, if one has eaten foods of a spicey nature (such as chili, garlic,
onions) within the last 24-72 hours one's palate and taste buds will be
seriously affected by those foods which in turn will affect the taste of
certain tobaccos as well. The impact of the above information upon my
smoking has been phenomenal! Thanks to this consideration, I now know which
tobaccos to avoid after eating Italian or Mexican food, etc., and have
enhanced my enjoyment immensely. I no longer judge a new blend hastily, but
rather weigh its characteristics against whatever foods I ingested recently
then wait before trying it again. This has saved countless time and tobacco
and resulted in more enjoyment on my part."

Wish I had that booklet; I've mailed Tobacco Express, but no answer yet.
Soon, I hope! I also hope to hear from y'all soon, too. Until next time,

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

Subject: Algerian briar

I have enjoyed this list and the expertise of its contributers.  I
don't usually have much to add, but I thought I would share my latest
acquisition. 

I was back up in my old stomping grounds, and couldn't resist
returning to Leavitt and Peirce to see what how my favorite
tobacconist was doing.  ('Scuse me while I load and light up :-) I
know there are better tobacconists, better pipes, and better tobaccos,
and I guess I'm a little young to be so set in my ways, but there it
is.  I got another of my favorite shape (~\V) David P. Ehrlic pipes
and some of my beloved cherry cavendish.  The pipe is a fairly tight
bird's eye on both sides with horizontal grain on the front and back
of the bowl.  Although there is a nick or two in the pipe, I cannot
find any fills.  The pipe is of Algerian briar, which the guy behind
the counter told me is almost extinct and is a harder wood than your
average briar (and thus takes longer to break in).  I smiled
ignorantly and appreciatively and paid my $25.  From my first
impressions, this pipe seems to smoke fairly cool.  What do the
members of this list know about this wood?

On smoking at work and other public places.  I'm a grad student, and
my one-fifth of a hole is too small and poorly ventilated for pipe
smoking.  I wouldn't inflict that much smoke on myself, much less on
my office mates.

While at Logan airport last Friday, I noticed one woman (non-smoker)
giving me dirty looks as I sat in the midst of the cigarette smokers.
I just put on my walkthing and ignored her.

In general, my rule is to treat the non-smoker's request in the spirit
it's given.  If they say "Would you please put your pipe out?"  I'll
reply "Certainly, I'm sorry if I was annoying you with it."  If they
say "Put that smelly, disgusting thing out!"  I'll comply, but I'll
probably mutter something like "Your mouthwash ain't making it."  I
definitely like the idea of just writing it off to your quota of
assholes for the day.

Keep the book,
brad

Amusing marketing ploy of the week:  Sherman's is now selling their
cigarettes in small boxes that say "I &lt;heart&gt; Harvard Square" -- six
for $2, such a deal! :-)

Subject: Get-together and a review system

Dear pipe people,

At Elias Mazur's urging, I'll be journeying into the Wicked City to
attend the July meeting of the NEW YORK PIPE CLUB! Yes, I eventually
did get around to calling Sailorman Jack and ascertaining that they
were still happening, generally on the first Tuesday of every month.
In July, though, the first Tuesday happens to be July 4, and the risk
of igniting fireworks while lighting up is just too extreme. So it'll
be held as follows:

WHEN:		Tuesday, July 11, 6:00 P.M.
WHERE:		La Bonne Soupe, 48 W. 55th St., New York.
HOWMUCH:	$2.00 plus Dutch treat dinner.
WHATTOBRING:	Anything you'd like to smoke or trade, any burning
		pipe questions, and any friends	who are also
		interested in coming.
WHATTOEXPECT:	Dunno; I've never been! But there are a lot of people
		there that know a lot about pipes, so expect to learn
		some stuff and have a good pipe with some congenial
		fellow smokers.

Hope to see you there! If you'd like to get together to check out some
pipe shops in NYC beforehand, let me know and I'll carve an itinerary.
Also, there is a lot of pipe club activity in other parts of the
country; if you'd like further information, why not write in?

				~\U

Second thing: Rick Hacker says, in _The Ultimate Pipe Book_, that he
keeps a small notebook with comments about tobaccos he's tried.
Following in his footsteps (magnifying glass in hand and calabash in
mouth), I'm playing around with a reviewing system for tobacco, and
would like to share it with you and get your comments and suggestions
(and hopefully your further reviews!). It's been fun to try to review
tobacco; I've gone through Hacker's and Ehwa's books, and have learned
a fair amount about how Toback is grown, processed, and blended, as
well as what makes a mixture good. (It's often a matter of body
chemistry, so your pleasure may vary!)

I've also had fun smoking new kinds of tobacco and paying careful
attention to their qualities. You can really get into tasting the
tobacco, finding out what you enjoy about it (and what you don't),
trying to describe it in writing, and just taking time to pay
attention to the small things. (And who knows - maybe you'll find the
Perfect Blend!) Try it -- you'll like it!

I'm not presenting this system as The Perfect One; it's really a list
of things to pay attention to. So feel free to use it, suggest
changes, or throw it in the /dev/null. For me, it's a nice thing to
do, and it seems to work!

		STEVE'S PATENTED TOBACCO REVIEW SYSTEM
		--------------------------------------
Ratings:
	**** Outstanding; I'll make this a regular for sure.
	***  Very good; a nice "rotation" smoke.
	**   OK, once in a while.
	*    Not very good.

Blank capsule review:
---------------------

[ These are the things I note at the top of any review, to give a
quick run-down on what the tobacco is like and how much I liked it. ]

- Type:			[ English, Danish, Cavendish, Gibberish... ]
- Price:		[ Preferably in florins per firkin ]
- Cut:			[ Long, cube, granulated, mangulated... ]
- Strength:		[ Wimpy, mild, medium, strong, vicious ]
- Flavorings:		[ If cased: vanilla, chocolate, Rocky Road... ]
- Packaging:		[ Loose, sealed tin, roll-up pouch, brown wrapper ... ]
- Rating:		[ * to **** on the Richter scale ]

Other things to note:
---------------------

[ I've been writing a paragraph or two about the tobacco, and trying
to note these things. Sometimes, I succeed! ]

- Place and date purchased.
- Freshness.
- Taste; guess at tobaccos used.
- Pipe used, esp. bowl size. Be sure to use a clean pipe!
- Burning characteristics: time, number of relights, ash produced.
- Tounge bite or wetness.
- Previous smokes, tounge bite, food, other factors that might affect the
  review.
- Recommendations for further smoking.
- Other general comments.


[ An example review, for something you may be able to find in your
local smokeshop. I'm slowly modifying the contents of the reviews as I
do more of them. ]

Dunhill "Royal Yacht" Mixture
-----------------------------
Type:		English.
Cut:		Long.
Strength:	Mild.
Flavoring:	None.
Package:	Vaccuum-sealed tin.
Price:		$0.75 for "trial size" (0.35 oz.).
Rating:		** 1/2.

Date: June 23, 1989. I bought this at the Highland Park tobacco shop, with a
few other samples.  It may have been on the shelf a while; there is no date
code. I smoked it in a small, straight Savinelli which I cleaned well
recently. My tounge was slightly burnt from smoking a few hours previously.
I had not eaten spicy food for about a day before.

It lights easily, burns steadily and cool. I think there is a bit of Turkish
in it. Not wet at all. A bit harsh on the upper palate when blown through
the nose. Mouth watered slightly at first. Core burns to a white ash,
charcoal around the edges. Later taste was quite good, Turkish comes
through. Base is probably Burley. Ash buildup put it out a couple of times.
No bite to speak of; it actually helped form a coat on my tongue and
cancelled the previous bite slightly. A half bowl lasted about 30 minutes.
Moderate nicotine buzz afterward.

I'd recommend it as a summer or morning smoke, or possibly for a beginning
pipe smoker who is used to Turkish cigarettes. Good with a small bowl.
Should probably retry with a fresher sample on a fresher tongue.

[ And I will! But until then... ]

Hope to see you at the NYPC on July 13 if you can make it! If not, why
not sit back with a bowl of your fave smoke and write it up? Until
next we meet, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

Subject: Pipal Infallibility

Our Benevolent Sponsor offers:

&gt;I'm playing around with a reviewing system for tobacco, and
&gt;would like to share it with you and get your comments and suggestions
&gt;
&gt;		STEVE'S PATENTED TOBACCO REVIEW SYSTEM
&gt;		--------------------------------------
&gt;Ratings:
&gt;	**** Outstanding; I'll make this a regular for sure.
&gt;	***  Very good; a nice "rotation" smoke.
&gt;	**   OK, once in a while.
&gt;	*    Not very good.

You're obviously a die-hard pipe smoker;  I'd have included :
             Even makes bad fertilizer
        ^- zero stars


&gt;Other things to note:
&gt;---------------------
&gt;
&gt;[ I've been writing a paragraph or two about the tobacco, and trying
&gt;to note these things. Sometimes, I succeed! ]
&gt;
&gt;- Burning characteristics: time, number of relights, ash produced.

I guess I'm not very good a pipe smoking; at least, not very efficient.
I smoke mostly dark cavendishes, which are relatively tough to keep going
in the first place; and I suspect my tamping technique leaves much to be
desired.  In any case, I tend to have to light frequently.  Of course,
a light Virginia will require fewer lights, even for me.  

In any case, I might suggest that a more useful measure is 
"Ease of Burning", (easy, moderate, difficult, use napalm), which would,
of course, be relative to the individual smoker.




Now, on another matter:

&gt; A bit harsh on the upper palate when blown through the nose. 
&gt;Moderate nicotine buzz afterward.

How many pipe smokers actually inhale the stuff ?  My dad taught me
that pipe smoke isn't to be inhaled, but rather drawn into the mouth and 
puffed out.  Likewise, cigars.

Seems as though most pipe smokers I know agree, but I've met a few
(mostly ex-cigarette smokers) who inhale to the lungs.  I can recall trying
it a few times when I was young and foolish; my old cavendish produced
quite a rush this way,  and got me wondering what exactly went into
flavoring the tobacco, and what it turned into when burned... I stopped
inhaling right away 8-)

Not trying to condemn anyone, of course; whatever floats your boat.


Finally, speaking of cigars; thanks to whoever it was that mentioned
Partagas cigars a few issues back.   I was killing time at a local smoke
shop, and, in between trying a couple bowls of new tobacco blends, noticed
their humidor.   Idly looking, I espied a box of Partagas cigars, and
a chime went off in my head.  I bought one and smoked it on the spot, while
getting something of an education in the ways of the cigar from the 
shopowner.

I must say, I enjoyed the smoke  !  A subtly different sensation from the
pipe, neither better nor worse; just different.  Having previously smoked
cigars on a college budget (i.e., A&amp;C's or Dutch Masters 8-(  ) I had
written them off as an uncouth, and rather Freudian, habit; needless to
say, I've seen the light, and now enjoy the occasional Partagas or
Plieades.  Thanks for tip !

Subject: Cigars

Having read good things about Partagas cigars in this group, I tried
one, and thoroughly enjoyed it; enough so that it has kindled a 
general interest in cigars.  While they're not strictly in keeping
with a "Pipe Digest", I doubt our Most Munificent and Benevolent
List Maintainer would object to a bit of banter concerning these
stogiceous delights.  And so:

I truly enjoy the finer cigars I've tried; Partagas, Plieades,
and a couple other brands.  But they're just too danged expensive
for my tobacco budget; for the price of one of these, I can get two
ounces of my favorite pipeweed, which lasts much longer.  What I
need is I, guess, a good, fifty-cent cigar.  Any suggestions ?

Subject: Tamping, inhaling, "Pipe Smoker..." newsletter, etc.

Our Most Prolific Contributor has trouble with tamping? Incredible, in this
day and age!

Seriously, though, I've learned a few things that help in this regard. You
want the pipe to draw about as hard as a good cigar (that is, with some
small resistance), and the tobacco should be packed at the same density all
the way down the bowl.

Sometimes, the tobacco leaves may lock together, especially in long-cut
tobacco (like Cavendish). To unlock them, gently pull them apart as you fill
the bowl. Try filling in stages - in each stage, fill the bowl loosely to
the top, then compress the tobacco until it's springy. When the bowl is
full, compress again until you get the proper draw.

When lighting, first char the surface, then tamp down and char it again. The
first charring helps more of the tobacco catch a light. [Hacker84]

(It also helps to be writing for the Pipes Digest while smoking! :-)

I had a little off-line conversation with Bill about blowing smoke through
the nose; some others may be curious. I don't inhale (except on rare
occasions when I want a little, legal rush! :-), though I have known pipe
smokers who did - their lungs kind of creaked after awhile. Exhaling through
the nose without inhaling smoke is kind of like swallowing while breathing
air out through your nose. I hope those who want to learn to do it will
persevere!

Lastly, I finally got a-hold-of the "Pipe Smoker and Tobacciana Trader"
newsletter from Pipe Collectors International (P.O. Box 22085, 6172 Airways
Blvd., Chattanooga, TN 37422). I think its appeal is more for the collector
than the recreational pipe smoker - they sponsor conventions, run ads for
pipemakers and specialty tobaccos, and have a small classified section.
Unfortunately, they've just changed from 6 issues per year to four per year
(still at $15 - v.7 n.1 was a 28-page B&amp;W tabloid), due to financial
pressures. It might be worth checking it out for a year, especially for the
collectors or carvers in the group!

Speaking of which, I hope to meet some of you folks in New York next Tuesday
(see above)! Until then, keep your bowls warm and glowing.

I *had* to respond to this.  Reading this prompted instant memories of
my grandfather (lo these many years ago) putting his tobacco
(Granger?) into his hand and rolling it between his palms to grind it
into a finer texture.  Then dumping it into the pipe using his hand as
a funnel.  It was an extremely dry tobacco as I recall.  I can't
imagine rolling the tobaccos I smoke in my hands before smoking it.

And since I am writing:
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; I had a little off-line conversation with Bill about blowing smoke through
  &gt;&gt; the nose; some others may be curious. I don't inhale (except on rare
  &gt;&gt; occasions when I want a little, legal rush! :-), though I have known pipe

  &gt;&gt; air out through your nose. I hope those who want to learn to do it will
  &gt;&gt; persevere!
  &gt;&gt; 

I don't inhale either, or exhale through my nose.  I still get the
occasional buzz.

In my introductory posting (many months ago) I mentioned that I was no
longer an active pipe smoker.  And I said that I might discuss the
reasons later.  Well, reading this list has tempted me to try my pipe
again and the old reasons have cropped up so maybe some has some
suggestions.  

First ( and I don't expect any help here) my wife hates it.  I don't
smoke at home, but she know when I am because she can smell it on my
breath ( and taste it occasionally:-).  She is also very sensitive to
smoke in general.  If I have been at a meeting (and not currently
smoking my pipe) she knows whether someone in the room had smoked a
cigarette by the smell on my clothes when I get home several hours later.

Secondly, it makes my throat hurt.  Maybe not enough to keep me from
smoking, but enough to be distracting.

Thirdly, I am a singer and the sore throat doesn't help.  I am not a
professional, understand, but the hobbies can conflict. 

Forthly, I don't think there are any pipe shops at all in Lafayette,
Indiana!  I am reduced to smoking Captain Black, Borkum Riff and the
like.  To be premeditated enough to actually order tobacco from a mail
order house would certainly tip off my wife that her opinion is little
thought of (:-).

Cheers,
Steve Holmes

[ Hope our members can help Mr. Holmes see his way through this conundrum! -S. ]

Subject: Cigar chemistry, cigar prices, and turning briar

&gt;How many pipe smokers actually inhale the stuff ?  My dad taught me
&gt;that pipe smoke isn't to be inhaled, but rather drawn into the mouth and 
&gt;puffed out.  Likewise, cigars.

I certainly don't.  My experience is like yours -- most pipe inhalers are
cigarette smokers trying to hurt themselves less.
There even may be a chemical reason for not inhaling pipes and cigars,
though the reference is long gone and I might be totally off base:
It seems that cigarette tobacco is so cured that the smoke tends to be slightly
acidic.  When it gets to the acid environment of the mouth, it finds nothing
to react quickly with, so you body can't get the "benefits" till it gets to
your lungs.  Pipe and cigar smoke is somewhat basic, so....


&gt;I truly enjoy the finer cigars I've tried; Partagas, Plieades,
&gt;and a couple other brands.  But they're just too danged expensive
&gt;for my tobacco budget....

Um.  I agree they're a luxury and only smoke one or two a week.  But even
here, where the tax has just shot way up, a Partagas costs a bit under $4.00.
Look what else you get get around here for $4.00:

	From one to two martinis in a bar, depending on whether it's a fancy
	bar with small drinks or a down-to-earth one with big ones.

	Four Its-Its(tm) chocolate-covered oatmeal-cookie ice cream sandwiches.

	Two-thirds of the admission to a movie.

Put in perspective with other luxuries, it's not bad.  And unless you smoke
the hell out of it, it'll last an hour and a half or so.


On pipe manufacture:

I had a nice chat with Jim Andre' about lathes and pipemaking.  Jim, whom
I've mentioned before, makes pipes and sell them at:

	Andre''s Pipe Gallery
	127 West Main St.
	Los Gatos, CA

About half the pipes he makes are turned.  The others are freehand.  The
difference between "hand cut" turned pipes and the others is that the
mass-production pipes use automatic lathes, like key-making machines, to
chomp out pipe after pipe.  The hand-made ones may use templates, but the 
maker will alter the shape to his mood and the nature of the wood.

He does not use fill.  If he finds a little hole, he leaves it;  if he finds
a big one, he changes the shape of the pipe or does some carving.  (I have
a very good Andre' with LOTS of carving -- it doesn't imply poor quality.)
We agreed that old fill always turned color a a different rate than the rest
of the wood and that bad old fill sometimes fall out entirely.

One of the hazards of hand-turning pipes is of course that nasty stem whomping
around and around. If you hit it with a tool, you're likely to ruin the pipe
by knocking it off entirely.  If you let it clobber your hand, it can ruin
your whole day.

Andre' is worth a visit if you're in Silicon Valley.  Los Gatos has nice res-
taurants, too.

Subject: The first-ever Pipenet Rendezvous

On Tuesday, July 11, it finally happened. In fact, a couple of "its" finally
happened.

I met Elias Mazur. The man who threw out the first bowl. The man who took
the flame for his beliefs. The man who set the Pipes Mailgroup alight.

OK, enough smelly puns (probably too much Latakia :-). Elias and I met to
explore the New York pipe scene, and smoke a few bowls with the members of
the New York Pipe Club.

Elias was in New York for a few days, mainly to visit relatives and go on a
few interviews there and in North Jersey. We rendezvoused at Penn Station,
and recognized each other after a bit of indecision (is this the right guy?)
We had about an hour and a half before the meeting, so we visited the
Connoisseur Pipe Shop at 51 W. 46th Street. He'd been there before, and liked
their handmade pipes and "Turkish Blend" tobacco, so I convinced him to humor
me and walk the nine or so blocks there.

The Connoisseur shop is tiny. It's also very good. The owner, Mr. Edward
Frederick Burak, designs all the pipes that the store sells; they also
custom-blend their own tobacco. There were no ceramic German beer steins or
lottery machines in evidence. It's a _serious_ pipeshop.

Mr. Burak wasn't in, but the salesman who was there was knowledgable and
helpful (in a New York-y kind of way, i.e., with vague disdain :-). We
admired the freehands behind the counter and in a glass cabinet at the front
of the store, but neither of us had plans to spend $250 for a pipe that day.
(If you've ever been in grad school, you know why not.) I decided on a
purchase - a huge bent rough-carved pipe ("NOT sandblast! Sandblasting shocks
the wood!" declared the salesman) and four ounces of their Turkish Black
tobacco, which he and Elias had both endorsed. ("What kind of tobacco do you
usually smoke?" "Well, lately I've been smoking some Sherlock's Choice from
the Tinder Box..."  "TINDER Box? Bah!" The salestype was assuredly not too
shy to express an opinion.) The three or four pipes I'd brought were
neglected for the rest of the evening, in favor of The Pipe That Burned
Manhattan And Parts of the Bronx.

Elias and I had hoped to also see Pipeworks and Wilke on 55th Street, but by
the time we got there the store had closed. We contented ourselves with a
short look through the window, then sallied forth to La Bonne Soupe to
negotiate the provendor of some souply comestibles. And, of course, to smoke
some good pipes and have some good conversation.

We asked where the Pipe Club meeting was ("Upstairs - you CAN'T miss 'em!"),
and up we went, following our noses. Steve Shoopak, also from Rutgers, had
been in the city all day, and he greeted us as we entered the dining room.
About fifteen people were there, smoking, trading, and talking pipes with
gusto. 

Steve, Elias, and I picked out a table to one side of the general hubbub and
ordered dinner. The food was excellent, and very reasonable. A few times
during dinner, one of the club members would come over and ask us if we had
any pipes to trade; unfortunately, none of us had (Steve, sadly, hadn't even
brought his own pipe; it had been temporarily, but irretrievably, buried in
the course of moving!) One gentleman was intent on selling his copy of
Richard Hacker's "Ultimate Pipe Video", and made a point of offering it to
all comers. (I'd like to see it someday, but have no plans to actually own
it.)

After dinner, Elias and I finally lit up, he with a small, beautiful briar
with brass inlays (which was admired by all), I with my new Connoisseur.
Sailorman Jack, the president of the club, eventually came in, welcomed us
warmly, and introduced us to the other members. We scouted around the dinner
tables, smoking, investigating the pipes on display, and exchanging views
with the members. Elias came across a nice buy: a small, straight-grain
Comoy that he picked up for a song; I, meanwhile, bought the Pipe Club's
handsome T-shirt (another copy of which was later given to the
long-suffering waitress!) 

We eventually drifted back over to our original tables, and joined the
Sailorman and a varying cast of other members in a wide-ranging conversation.
We talked of history, politics, plays, the ethics of the warrior, the nature
of college education, and of course pipes. Time flew; Elias and I shifted
from the Turkish Black to Balkan Sobranie, by way of a home-blended vanilla
mixture I accepted from another member. My pipe and I began to know and
trust each other, as did the old and the new members of the Club. My
friends, if you ever can an evening smoking your pipe and conversing with
intelligent fellows over good wine and beer, please by all means do so
without hesitation. It was a time of great quality.

Gradually, bowls burned low and members drifted into the night; soon it was
time to find our way home. Elias and I parted at the subway, vowing to
return to the Pipe Club next month if we could find a way. As I waited for
the returning train, I finished the last puffs from the Connoisseur's huge
bowl, and became aware of the glance of a pretty young lady, presumably also
biding her time for a train. Alas, I could do no more than to return it in
kind; the station, unlike the Club, does not encourage strangers to become
friends.

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Cigars Ordinaire

Someone was asking about 50-cent cigars the other week.  I can't 
honestly recommend any,  but have a suggestion to repeat.

You have to remember that Partagas and Pleiades and H. Upmann and
Montecruz and the like are the creme de la creme, the vintage wines of
the puffing world. (I even saw some cigars this weekend with a Rothschild
brand.  $7.10.  Gulp.)  These are for special occasions, for me, anyway.

For a good, solid, cigar, look to all-tobacco ones from the Connecticut
Valley.  One good brand is Breva ($.80 this morning), another is Judges
Cave.  Now these are to the Partagas as jug red is to fine Burgundy,
but they're honest cigars.

The words to watch out for on cigar boxes are "Predominantly tobacco
with non-tobacco materials added."  They mean that the cigar is a brown
paper tube stuffed with chopped tobacco, perhaps wrapped with paper
made from tobacco leavings.  These cigars, my friends, are stinky fat
cigarettes.

For other less expensive smokes, try some of the European dry-cured
cigars.  They're different, but good.  Let me strain my spelling skill
and suggest Schimmelpennick.

But there's a reason those Partagas cost so much.  Sigh.

[I know, I know, I got off pipes completely.  I'm planning to be at 
SIGGRAPH in Boston at the end of the month.  I'll bring my pipes, and
maybe revisit Ehrlich's.  Will anyone else be there?]		~

Subject: NYPC on August 1, matches, etc.

Well, as anyone who saw the last posting knows, a few of us got together at
the New York Pipe Club's monthly meeting and had a really enjoyable time. If
you're in the NYC area on Tuesday, August 1, why not plan on dropping in for
some soup, a good smoke, and some interesting and friendly chatter? The event
will occur at La Bonne Soupe, 48 W. 55th St., at 6:00 P.M. This time I'll
try to leave enough time to check out the Wilke shop, also on 55th St. Hope
to see you there!

Ami Silberman asked, awhile ago, about matches for pipe smoking, and
recommended Swan Vestas. Well, after 3 or 4 boxes, I really have to say that
I like Diamond Safety Matches (the kind in the pocket-size boxes) better,
because they're both longer and less expensive. My only gripes with Diamonds
are that they're _hard_ to find (finally tracked them down at an Acme
supermarket in Flemington!), and they are a bit hard to keep lit initially,
especially in a breeze (though I think Vestas have the same problem). For
those who are coming to NYPC, La Bonne Soupe _gives away_ some very good
quality wooden matches!

Oh, yes - one fellow at last month's soiree' offered me some tobacco, which
I accepted. When I scratched a match to light it, he retorted, "Forget that
stuff!" and produced a lighter, which I accepted out of politeness. I have
to say that I'm philosophically opposed to lighters - they burn the lip of
the bowl if they're up too high or if you're lighting a fresh pipe. Also,
there's something much more aesthetically pleasing about lighting a pipe
with a match (they don't hiss, for one thing!) But to each his own.

The _ne plus ultra_ of pipe smoking is, of course, to pick up a coal from a
wood fire and use that to light your pipe - you taste the wood and tobacco
smoke, and it just feels so comforting. (Make sure to use tongs, or it
won't! :-)

We've been adding a few new members here and there - always glad for a
bigger audience, and some new voices and new info! Speaking of which, Tom
Dunn promises us a mention in the next _Ephemeris_, so we should hopefully
see some more people aboard soon through those channels. In the meantime,
pleasant living to you all!

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Matches and other lights

&gt; Ami Silberman asked, awhile ago, about matches for pipe smoking, and
&gt; recommended Swan Vestas. Well, after 3 or 4 boxes, I really have to say that
&gt; I like Diamond Safety Matches (the kind in the pocket-size boxes) better,
&gt; because they're both longer and less expensive. My only gripes with Diamonds
&gt; are that they're _hard_ to find (finally tracked them down at an Acme
&gt; supermarket in Flemington!), and they are a bit hard to keep lit initially,
&gt; especially in a breeze (though I think Vestas have the same problem).

For outdoors, it's awful hard to beat a simple Bic Butane lighter.  I
normally use a somewhat classy lighter (i.e., it cost more than ten
bucks), but for whatever reason, the Bics are simply easier to keep lit.
(I figure it must be the little metal screen around the nozzle).  Too,
you don't feel bad if you lose one.

&gt; Oh, yes - one fellow at last month's soiree' offered me some tobacco, which
&gt; I accepted. When I scratched a match to light it, he retorted, "Forget that
&gt; stuff!" and produced a lighter, which I accepted out of politeness. I have
&gt; to say that I'm philosophically opposed to lighters - they burn the lip of
&gt; the bowl if they're up too high or if you're lighting a fresh pipe.

True.  If I'm sitting around the house smoking, esp. a new pipe, I'll
reach for a match.  Too, my best pipes don't leave my apartment, for fear
of having them lost or banged up.  Anything I walk around with, I'm willing
to light with butane.


&gt;Also,
&gt; there's something much more aesthetically pleasing about lighting a pipe
&gt; with a match (they don't hiss, for one thing!) 

Ah, but let's see you blow out the match and then stick it back in your
pocket 8-)
 
&gt; The _ne plus ultra_ of pipe smoking is, of course, to pick up a coal from a
&gt; wood fire and use that to light your pipe - you taste the wood and tobacco
&gt; smoke, and it just feels so comforting. (Make sure to use tongs, or it
&gt; won't! :-)

Anybody tried those cedar sticks some cigar smokers use ?

Alternately, the true die-hard (or those, like myself, in fits of
desparation) can light his pipe using his car's cigarette lighter.  No
chemical tastes there !

Subject: Pipe stands, accidents, and longevity

As it happens, I've had a couple of accidents this week. The first was to
my cherished old Ben Wade "Hand Pipe."

I'd inherited a pipe stand from a friend whose father hadn't used it for
years, and who had in fact given up pipes :-( The stand may have been the
reason... In any case, it's sitting on top of my credenza, and the Ben Wade
(a large freehand with at least four different comfortable hand positions
built in) was on the end, precariously poised above empty space.

Well, Friday, the inevitable happened. The pipe took a swan dive off the
stand and landed stem-first on top of my desk. End of stem. Searching
through my back issues of P.D., I located the "Pipes Unlimited" address that
Elias had posted, and will be sending the pipe to Utica, NY for repairs. By
the time it gets back, I may even be able to smoke again...

Because, the very day after the pipe broke, I had an accident on my bicycle.
Crashed the sucker into a car. My fine old Raleigh Gran Sport was totalled,
as was my helmet (thank G*d it was on!), and I have chips out of four teeth
and a very sore neck. So I haven't been smoking since, for fear of damaging
the stem or my teeth. Sigh.

But I have been looking up a reference about pipe smoking and longevity,
which might be of interest... Apparently, pipe smokers live about exactly as
long as those who don't indulge (according to "The Health Consequences of
Smoking," published by the US. Department of Health, Education and Welfare
in 1973). There are other rumors out that pipe smokers may actually live up
to 18 months _longer_ than nonsmokers! (Maybe the Latakia fumigates the
germs...) I'll post as I learn more.

In any case, this represents conclusive proof that bicycling is a greater
health risk than pipe smoking (though I wish I hadn't been an experimental
subject!) After all, most people are tolerant enough of pipes that they're
not going to try to run you over just for smoking - I hope!

Anyway, please light up for me in my involuntary abstinence, and we hope to
hear from you soon.

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

free advice on those members who are interested in getting Cigars less
expensively --

While I'm a haphazard pipe smoker at best, I've been smoking cigars fairly
regularly for the past ten years.  Since, for most of that time, I've been on a
student budget, I've become pretty adept at finding good quality smokes at
decent prices.

Most "name" cigars that you can purchase are really just "names." Pleides and
the top line Dunhill cigars, in my opinion, are two of the most overrated and
overpriced cigars that can be bought (As are the Davidoffs -- which I haven't
seen recently, which may be a good sign . . . ).

Most imported cigars that are sold in the US come from factories in
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Canary Islands, and Honduras. The
strength or body of the smoke is determined by its place of origin
(with the order listed above as a rough indicator strenth -- Jamacian
cigars being the mildest), the color of the wrapper (with strength
increasing with the darkness of the wrapper, from the acrid green
claro wrapper through the medium brown wrapper called EMS or English
Market Selection to the nutty, sweetish, dark brown maduro), and the
size of the cigar (a function of diameter, or ring gauge, rather then
of length -- the ring gauge, of course, determining the volume of
smoke inhaled).

Factories produce cigars and then sell them to the different companies
whose name you see on the box.  Unfortunately for the factories, and
fortunately for you, production and the companies' demands do not
always coincide.  Overrun cigars, or seconds cigars (which may or may
not be an indication of quality -- cigars can be rejected for aethetic
reasons such as color) are sold, by most reputable tobacconists, as
"bundle" cigars, noted by their place of origin ( e.g., Dominican
bundles, and so on).  In all my meanderings, these cigars are usually
half the price of their named doubles, ranging in price from, say .75
to 2.00.  (Unfortunately, the .50 imported cigar is probably as rare
as the kiwi bird).

The largest retailer of cigars in America, incidently, bypasses all
this buys his cigars directly from the factories and then sells them
very inexpensively through mail order.  His name is JR Rothman, and
his #is 1-800-JR-CIGAR (catchy, eh?).  His "alternative" cigars are
probably the best buy around.

While I enjoy a Partagas now and again, and could happily survive on a diet of_
__Excalibur I _cigars, I am content with usually smoking bundled cigars.   I
hope this information helps the club members who take up a cigar, the way I
occassionally enjoy a pipe of tobacco.

Subject: Pipes notes

I've been rather disconcerted  lately  about  the  lack  of  news
comming  across  the _PIPES_ newsletter.  In order to be fair, I
guess it is like wanting to get mail from somebody.  If you don't
write  you  won't  receive.  So,  with that in mind I will add my
notes about pipe wanderings.

My creation is complete!!!  I finally found the right kind of wax
to  put on my pipe in order finish the wood.  I have been smoking
this pipe exclusively for the last couple of  days  in  order  to
break  it  in.  Of course it's the best smoking pipe that I have,
hard to be disappointed in a pipe you built yourself.  I  am  now
looking  around  for  a  small lathe (Used!) in order to turn the
next briar that I have.  Maybe if I get good enough I  can  offer
pipes for sale.

I made a visit to Andre's Pipe Shop in Los Gatos CA.  Even toting
along  the  wife and family (normally a mistake when going into a
smoke shop) I had a very good time.  The shop is  very  low  key,
and  not  too big (more like a wide hallway).  The person working
the counter was very friendly ( a lost art out here  in  CA)  and
wanted  know  where  I had heard about the shop.  My reference to
this news group impressed him and he was fascinated by  how  many
ways news could get around these days.  I asked him about Andre's
pipes and he pointed to the case closest to him and said that  it
was  open.  I  examined most of the pipes and they were very good
and very honest.  I  could  not  find  any  fills  and  this  was
confirmed  by the salesman saying that only a few pipes were ever
filled, the  pits  (few  and  small)  were  left  in.  They  were
arranged  in  the cabinet by price; value pipes on the bottom and
collector's pipes on the top.  I could afford to  buy  one  about
half  way  up.  The  next  pipe that I buy will be an Andre, I am
pretty sure.

I went to a smoke shop in San  Jose  called  _Smokers  Paradise_.
This  is  a  good  shop,  their  top  of  the line pipes are just
beautiful (anybody got a spare $200 to let  a  poor  pipe  smoker
realize his dream?).  The only problem with the shop is that they
cover the full range of smoking, and I  mean  FULL  range.  So  I
don't care for the "Head Shop" section of the store.  While I was
there I bought an old  edition  of  a  publication  called  _Pipe
Smoker_.  This  is  the  quarterly(?)  newsletter  of  PCI, _Pipe
Smokers International_.  I have read this 12 page  magazine  from
cover to cover and enjoyed each article.  They had just had a big
convention in St.  Louis (this was in 1985).  Do any of you  know
if  this  organization  still  exists?  I  am tempted to become a
member just for the newsletter, but  they  offer  other  services
like club pipes and conventions.

Well that's all for now, but I think there is a  pipe  convention
here  locally  in  the  S.F.  Bay Area (are you ready for another
trip Steve?) I will write if I can find out about the convention.

[Norm, thanks for your comments, and congratulations on your new
creation! What shape did you carve? It's not too likely I can get to
S. F. for the convention, but I hope you'll make it, and that we'll
meet in person sometime!  Read on for some further, hopefully relevant
musings on your letter. -S.]

Subject: Participatory pipeocracy

Well, once again it's time to fill a favorite pipe (this time, a large
Peterson), and edit the digest. This time, I'll say a few things about
the mailgroup itself, in response to Norm's letter.

When I started the group, the volume of messages behaved somewhat
predictably - a lot of things got posted at first, and then the talk
burned down a bit. I never expected a huge volume of messages, for a
variety of reasons. 

First off, we're a small group (about 20-30 members, not counting the
digest echo into arpanet). It's not likely to get huge; I forget the
percentage of people who smoke pipes, but it's something like 5%, and
far fewer of us make a hobby out of pipes. We're never going to have
the volume of soc.singles (not that we should!)

Second, my tactic in putting out the letter has been to accumulate
mailings until Sunday, and (assuming someone's submitted something),
to send them out then. That way, those of us who have Real (tm) Jobs
will have something to look forward to on Monday mornings, before we
have to really get down to business! Does anyone have comments on
whether this encourages people to send things in? (Or whether you like
it in general.)

Also, the only way you have new things to say is if you learn new
things! If it's been ages since you tried any new blends of tobacco,
why not go pick up a sample and let us know what you think? You might
find something you really enjoy; at worst, you can save the rest of us
from being subjected to Old Anthracite :-)

You can also pick up a lot of information talking to others; that's
what the group is for. I'd also urge you to get in touch with a pipe
club, or go to some swap meets. It's also rewarding to sit down, light
up, and swap opinions with a friend, old or new! And you'll have some
new stories to bring back to us. I hope you'll try it!

We'd love to hear from you! And we promise no flame, except as applied
to your favorite smoke. :-)

				~\U

OK, now on to some other things... Norm, the address for the Pipe
Smoker tabloid is:

	Pipe Collectors International
	P. O. Box 22085
	6172 Airways Blvd.
	Chattanooga, TN 37422

For $15, they'll send you one year's worth (i.e., four issues); they
also have some members-only offers on pipes, and those look like an
excellent value! They could use your support, I'm sure!

The last issue mentions some upcoming pipe conventions, but none in
the Bay Area specifically. But here's what's still coming up. All of
these meets have hotel and table space available (yr. obd't. servant
is a bit too lazy to retype them all! :-)

SEPT. 23 - Fort Mill, SC. Tar Heel Briar Friars Annual Show. Contact
Dennis Congos, 936 Autumnwood Lane, Charlotte, NC 27213 - (704)
597-5599 evenings, 547-2677 days.

Pipe Show and Swap. This sounds like fun! Contact Jacques Bogguess,
Box 509, Northpark Mall, Davenport, IA 52806 - (319) 391-4055.

OCT. 20-22 - Las Vegas, NV. Mark Kaufman Memorial Pipe Show and Swap.
Sponsored by the Greater Bay Area Pipe Club (Norm, take note!) Contact
John Herring, 1103 Chaucer St., Berkeley, CA 94702 - (415) 849-0894,
or Marty Pulvers, 278 Lassen Ave., Mountain View, CA 94043 - 965-4773.

From the _Ephemeris_, Marty is also the contact person for the Bay
Area Pipe Club! If anyone else wants to get information about pipe
activities in your neighborhood, mail the Digest and I'll put up the
request (and try to dig up some info myself.)

Last thought - if anyone has something to sell, and you'd care to
advertise here, feel free! Maybe we could even work out a way to
exchange images in PostScript bitmap form (or whatever!) In whatever
format, I hope to hear from you soon.

					Smoke in peace,

A good point;  and I would suggest that even some of "us" aren't
quite true hobbyists. Myself, for example.

As an analogy, consider wine.  Many people drink it; a fraction of
those really bother to learn about what they're drinking, enough to
know a few good vintages, possibly build up a small wine cellar, know
what wines to serve when, etc.  To translate this into pipe terms, I'd
say, would include knowledge of technical matters (for example, how
pipes are made; hand- vs. machine-carved,  pits and fills, finishes, etc.),
tobacco lore (how it's grown, cured, flavored, blended), history, etc. 
On that basis, I personally don't qualify as a "hobbyist", though
I'm slowly becoming one, thanks largely to this group.

BTW, I do enjoy receiving the digests on Mondays.  Anything is better than
getting down to work that morning... 8-)




Subject:   Tobacco Roots


There's one area of smoking I *do* know something about, and that's
tobacco growing.  Now, I don't know a *lot*, but I'll bet others in
this group can fill in the gaps.

My grandparents used to raise a bit of tobacco on their southwestern Ohio
farm, so this is mostly from youthful experience (I helped them from
the time I was about 9 years old until I went off to college).  They grew
Seed Leaf, a variety of tobacco used mostly for cigars, so take that as
a caveat; there are differences in how the various tobaccos are grown,
and I have experience only with this sort.

Tobacco growing is highly regulated, to maintain price control.  This means
that each grower has a "base", a certain acreage he is allowed to grow.
Each farmer grows as much as his base will allow, because it is a very
high-value crop.   It is also extremely complicated and labor-intensive.

Because each square foot of the base acreage is so valuable, great pains are
taken to ensure complete utilization.   The tobacco growing season begins
in early spring, when seedbeds are turned up.   A seedbed is a small plot
of land where the seeds will be planted and nurtured, until the "sprouts"
are large enough to transplant into the fields.  Young tobacco is slow-
growing and fragile; left on its own in a harsh world, it will suffer huge
"infant mortality" to insects, and to weeds which grow more quickly and
steal its sunlight and nutrients.

So the tobacco beds are spaded to up-end and us loosen the soil.  Next,
large metal pans (about 6 feet long and three to four wide (the width of
the beds) are inverted over the turned soil; into these pans is piped live
steam.  The purpose is to sterilize the soil; it is about to be heavily
fertilzed and pampered, which is weed heaven.

Steaming itself is rather amazing.  The steamer my grandpa hired each year
had an old Ford truck with the bed removed, and a small locomotive steam
engine fitted.  It looked like something out of the 1800's.  In fact, the
whistle was still fitted, and at the end of the job, he'd let go with a
long blast  (and sometimes he'd even let us kids pull the rope ! 8-)

Once the beds are steamed, 6" high wooden frames are erected around them.
The beds are fertilzed, then seeded; then a tent of thin canvas is 
stretched over them, to keep out insects and airborne seed (The
canvas is thin enough to allow sunlight in).  The beds are then watered 
daily and fertilized several times a week, until the plants have grown 
to a height of about six inches.  This period is sort of tricky;  too 
much fertilzer can "burn" the plants (the fertilizer is ammonia-based,
so too much of it can increase the alkalinity of the soil too far), and
too much water can lead to rot and mildew.

A word on seed.   My grandfather always saved seed from the previous year's
crop, and I gathered that this was the norm.   A gentleman at a local
smoke shop told me that tobacco quickly adapts to its locality.  His
example was the vaunted Cuban Seed Leaf, so coveted by cigar smokers.  He
claimed that, while seed could be taken from Cuba to other
locations, such as Honduras, and would grow Cuban-quality plants the first
year, the seed produced by those plants would be adapted to the
new environment, and produce a very different crop the next year.  I
don't understand this, genetically, but I suppose the differences
between the two tobaccos are small enough to make it believable.

In any case, tobacco seed is apparently quite valuable;  so much so,
in fact, the my grandfather carefully protected his, to such an extent
that I've never seen any !

My, how I do go on !   I can see this is going to run into quite a bit more
than I'd expected, so I think I'll break it into several installments.
We'll let our seedlings grow for a week, and next time, we'll discuss
tobacco setting.

Subject: Pipes_digest - misc. matters

I have enjoyed the pipes_digest very much.  Reading the comments it seems
that I have been smoking a pipe for a very long time, that is, in
compairson to the times mentioned - I have been doing so almost 30
years.  My first was a prop for a production of a play as a Senior in
High School!!

But I do have a question:  Does anyone know of a pipe shop in Columbus,
Ohio?  I believe that it was on Gay Street.  I had dealings with them
almost a decade ago.  The were very big on GBD pipes - their exclusive
was a hourglass shape - which I have enjoyed for over 15 years.  I
wonder if they are still in business - I have lost the name and
address.  I could not at the time afford most of their offerings, but
did splurge on the hour-glass.  I have bought a few of the "cheapee" or
rejects from Connoisseur and have been satisfied.  Anyone remember
when they also sold coffee and tea in addition to pipes and tobacco?

	Lastly, an earlier message mentioned that an archive server
was running.  I have tried twice with no response.  Any additional
information?  Perhaps you could resend the address and indicate the
contents?

Subject: Boston stores; age of college students; power tools; related matters

At SIGGRAPH this year I had the chance to check out some Boston smoking
haunts from my youth and am pleased to say they are doing fine.  
They include David P. Ehrlich's, L. J. Peretti, and Leavitt and Pearce.
Note that there are no cute business names.  Note that none of them are
in (my pet peeve) malls.  Note that all three of them
were founded before anyone we ever knew was born.*

Peretti's (Park Circle, at the juncture of the Common and the Public Garden)
is the most traditional in one sense -- it makes no particular attempt to
look old.  It just is.  The selection of tobaccos is complete and includes
many straight tobaccos for blending.  The pipes are varied and reasonable.

Ehrlich's (Tremont Street, between Scollay Square (now Government Center)
and Park Street, next to Erich Fuchs, a fine hobby store) is a little glitz-
ier, with fancy wood and such about.  The owner said that they had trouble
insuring their wonderful collection of old meerschaum, and that is had moved
to "the Tobacco Museum in Nashville."  I'd certainly like to hear more
about that place.

Anyway, I picked up one of their seconds ($12.95) for old time's sake, and
some tobacco, and some cigars of a new brand.  It was a good visit.

Like most tobacco stores, Ehrlich's has had to branch out a bit.  But 
instead of beer steins or statues of sailors, they decided to stock a
few fine wines.  Good for them.

(Smoker's Paradise is, as Norm says, a trifle weird. It has carried
"branching out" about as far as is possible.  The tobacco side
of the store includes very small and exotic-looking pipes, not to mention
Fat Freddy comics.  The other side is a lock shop with ton-sized safes
lying around.  If you have more than a few dozen old Dunhills, you might
need one :-))

Ehrlich's sister store, Leavitt and Pierce in Harvard Square, has changed
even less.  (College students have gotten young, though...)  For many
years _their_ sideline was board games, mostly chess.  They still have
lots of chess stuff, but have acquired a fine stock of go paraphernalia
and literature as well.  It was a good visit.

----

Norm, it was good to hear that you finished your pipe and that you liked
Andre's.  Good luck with finding a used lathe.  Unfortunately, things like
that don't seem to come on the used market until they're all beat up or
their owner dies.  The Unimat(tm) system seems to be of a good size
for pipes, and includes an indexing jig that you could use for the kind
of faceted pipes you described earlier.  With all the right pieces, it
would spend up most of a grand, though.  You can buy lotsa pipes for that.

The one pipe store in Soquel, whose name slips my mind, has a meerschaum
carving kit for sale, though.  You might explore that as a next project.

(Soquel is one town south of Santa Cruz, on the coast 40 miles over the
hill from Silicon Valley.  A nice place to visit, but not worth the haul
just for that store.)

---
*Well, they were founded a long time ago.  I was born in 1944.  My neighbor
at one house, a Mrs. Corcoran, was born in 1855 and lived till 1952.  I
received a watch from her as a posthumous birthday present.  Anyway, Mrs.
Corcoran may have antedated one or more of these stores.

___
I've used up my alloted time without even mentioning my new pipe.
Not the Ehrlich cheapie, which is giving good service, but the other one.
Wait for next time.  Smoke safely; the drought is everywhere.
Keep those contributions coming.

						phil

[ Thanks for all the good info - I've got to look into the Boston pipe
  scene at some point! Looking forward to hearing about your "other" new
  acquisition. -S. ]

Subject:   Tobacco Roots II - 

(hum the Main Title from Star Wars as you read this)


                    When last we left our 
                 intrepid young plants, they 
              were safe and snug in their beds, 
          awaiting  that brave new dawn that would 
      see them standing  in the broad  expanse of the 
   Back Forty.  But  Darth Nature still holds a few cards,
and  you shouldn't  count your  tobacco until  it's smoking...


[insert dazzling special effects here]


Okay, the time has come.  Our tobacco plants are shoosting up out of the
ground, eager to live free.  Over the next week or two, we'll be
transplanting them into the field.

In preparation, the soil in the field is first tilled; plowed, then disked
repeatedly and levelled, to provide a soft, flat bed for the tender young
plants.  This is done the morning of the planting, for maximum effect.

The tobacco beds are heavily watered, section by section, to loosen the
soil so that the sprouts can be plucked out, roots and all, without damage.
Enough plants are "pulled" for the day's transplanting; over the planting
season, each section will be pulled two or three times; after the first
picking, the remaining plants grow more rapidly.  Plants are perfect for
tranplanting when about 6" or more high. 

The pulled plants are kept in wooden boxes, metal washpans, etc, and packed
rather tightly to retain moisture during the day.   They are kept in the
shade, to keep them cool; if they wilt, they become harde to handle.

While the tobacco is pulled, (which, someone, seems to be mostly women's
work, and a fine place to pick up gossip 8-)  the menfolk prepare the
equipment.  The water wagon (a wagon mounting a large water tank) is
filled, a trailer is loaded with fertilier, insecticide, and herbicide,
and the transplanter is greased and checked. By the time this is done, it's
11:00 and time for dinner.  In the afternoon, this curious armada drives 
out to the field and sets up shop.  

The transplanter is a curious affair. It's a small, two-wheeled trailer,
towed behind a tractor.  On it are two rearward-facing seats for the
"setters" (so called because they "set" the tobacco); between them is a
vertically-looped conveyer belt which bears a number of rubber "fingers."
As the planter moves along, this chain-driven belt moves through a guide
which closes the fingers, in which the setters have placed a plant.  The
plant is carried down inside a small plow, which has created a shallow
trench; as the plant's roots reach the trench, a dose of
insecticide-bearing water (from a tank on the rear of the planter) is 
dropped in.  Fertilizer (from a front-mounted hopper) has already been laid
alongside the trench.

As the fingers reach the bottom of their travel and begin to open, two
wheels roll past, gently squeezing the soil around the plant.  Finally,
a herbicide mixture is sprayed along the row of plants.

This is a necessarily slow process; the setters can only feed plants so
fast.  (In fact, they occasionally miss one or more, so that a small boy
(yours truly, for several years 8-) rides the water barrel with a peg
and a handful of plants, ready to jump down and fill in any missed spots).
An afternoon's work sees two or three acres set.

Two-row planters, requiring four setters, exist, and there are legends of
4-row monsters 8-)

The next step is to wait for a rain a week or so later.  After the rain,
while the ground is still muddy, barefooted workers (another good job
for small boys who've recently read Huck Finn) walk the fields, looking for
gaps where plants have failed to survive the shock of transplanting.
They carry a few plants and a wooden peg, and reset these missing spots.

The plants are now largely on their own now for most of the growing
season; all that is done is to cultivate them about once every two or three
weeks.  A small tractor with a set of "cultivators" (shallow plows,
designed to cut just below the soil surface) drives along each row,
uprooting the weeds growing between the row.  During the earliest part of
the season, while the plants are still small enough to be shaded by weeds,
workers even manually hoe between the plants, where the cultivators can't
reach.

Next week:  Flowers, Topping, and the Sucker Menace

Michael J. Lavery asks:

&gt; But I do have a question:  Does anyone know of a pipe shop in Columbus,
&gt; Ohio?  I believe that it was on Gay Street.

I know of several, but none on Gay.  Perhaps you're thinking of Smoker's
Haven, on High Street just south of Gay ?  17 S. High Street, 
(614) 221-4555.

Subject: How Old Is This Pipe?

Atop the bookshelf next to my Smoking Chair is an old pipe, that's
been in my family a lot longer than I have.  My understanding has
always been that it belonged to my great-grandfather (a Civil War
veteran), which would make it a century or so old, but an article I
recently saw in passing has caused me to wonder if it isn't much
older.

The bowl is porcelein, long and graceful, with a hinged &amp; vented cap
of what I take to be brass.  The bowl is decorated with a painting
(not, apparently, a decal) of a stag.  There is a joint below the
bowl that is also porcelein, and forms an acute angle, so the stem
points straight up when the bowl is upright.  The stem is of
unpeeled (cherry?) wood, about 10 inchel long, with a
flexible-appearing section of some woven fabric about 2 cm in
length.  Over that is a round, bent mouthpiece.  The bowl was
cracked many (50+) years ago, but the pipe was apparently felt to be
too valuable to discard.  Obviously, I don't smoke it, but the
residue in the bowl indicates it has been smoked, though probably
not in living memory.

The article I saw had a drawing of an identical pipe, which it
labeled a mid-17th century design!  Can it be that my ancestor
bought it as an antique?  Is there a kind and erudite reader of this
group who can shed some light on this?

Subject: Happy end.

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

After a long and painful process, only alleviated by my relaxing
moments enjoyed with my pipes, I finally got a job. This means that I
will be able to keep in touch with the group and enjoy reading our now
famous pipe digest.

My new job is located in Madison, NJ, which means that I will be able
to take advantage of the many pipe stores in NYC and also able to
attend the meetings of the NY Pipe Club. Before starting the job I
will travel to Brazil to visit my family. I will spend 3 to 4 weeks
there.

Since I haven't been very active lately,( reason: the famous 'moving
adventure') I will try to catch up on some topics discussed here in
the past pipe digests. I followed the discussion about cigars and I
would like to give a suggestion to those of you that, like me, enjoy a
good cigar once in a while. There is a very good cigar, hard to find,
made in Brazil, more specificly in Bahia, the state in Brazil where I
come from. It is definitely worth a try.  It is called Suerdick and
I'm sure that many of you have seen and tried it before. It is a very
good cigar and considered world wide as one of the best. The reason
behind its quality is the climate of the region where they grow the
tobacco. The climate is very similar to the one in Cuba, and that's
why Mr. Suerdick started his plantation in that area some time ago.
They have a wide variety of types of cigars, but I am not very
familiar with it. Since I am going to be there, I will buy a fairly
large number of them, considering that the price is something like 20%
of the price here in the USA and is always easy to find. I will give
more details of these cigars when I come back from Brazil.

Back to pipes, I can say that I finally came to fully appreciate
free-hand pipes. I got an excellent deal the last time I went to Mr
Bob Smith's store in Utica, and bought my second free-hand. Very good
pipe! The advantage of the free-hand is that they are usually made
from the very top of the briar root, which is the best part of the
wood and gives a beautiful straight grain. This provides a very cool
smoke. I am sure that soon I will add another one to my collection.

Well, I will be back from Brazil by the end of September. Until then,
I wish you all a cool and pleasant smoke till the last puff of your
pipe. 

Smoke in peace.

- Elias Mazur.

Subject: New York Sailormen and Pennsylvania Dutch

Well, folks, my neck is almost healed, I'm still fighting it out with the
health insurance, and I'm going to try once more to visit the New York Pipe
Club's meeting this Tuesday. It's at the usual place (La Bonne Soupe, 48 W.
55th St.) at 6 PM. Please let me know if you'd like to come along or
rendezvous up there - there are bargains, good food, and good fellowship to
be had!

I learned something surprising this weekend, while stuck in a traffic jam on
Route 30, east of Lancaster, PA. Along the side of the road, a group of ten
or so Amish farmers were harvesting a fine-looking crop of Pennsylvania
tobacco. (Didn't even know they grew tabak in PA - nor even what it was
until my friend identified it for me!) They were, of course, using two
horses and a buckboard as their only machinery, and seemed a bit shy about
being gawked at by the "English". Quite a few of the barns in the area are
built for tobacco curing - they have narrow, high vertical boards which can
be moved around to control airflow.

Also in the Something New Every Day Dept: Sailorman Jack, of the New York
Pipe Club, writes that used pipe cleaners can be re-used to initially clean
a pipe, following up with fresh cleaners. Claims Joe Tannenbaum of NYPC:
"The pipe doesn't know the difference." Sailorman claims to have reduced his
pipe cleaner consumption by 75% - while getting his pipes just as clean.
(NYPC Newsletter, August 1989).

I'll probably be getting very busy after the next meeting, and don't know
how many more of them I can make in the next few months. So, I hope some of
the Greater New York (i.e., Entire East Coast, according to NYC :-) crowd
can attend and join me for a pipe or two. Until next time, then, hope I can
hear from you on the mailgroup, and as always,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject:   Tobacco Roots III - The Growing Menace
 
After the first few critical weeks, the tobacco plants become
very hardy.  They are, by nature, large and bushy, so they tend to
shade out any weeds which would compete; and there are not many
predators that care to eat any but the youngest plants.

One of those that do exist, though, is the tobacco worm
(eatimus cavendish); a large (1/2"x2") green caterpillar.  These are not a
major threat, as they don't eat much, but they are worth controlling for
Seed Leaf growers because they cut holes in the leaves, rendering them
unusable for cigar wrapping.  Spray insecticides are sufficient, and only
one application, after the initial planting, is needed.

Another threat, particularly later in the season, is hail;  a heavy
hailstorm can ruin the leaves, greatly reducing the crop's worth.

The next thing that needs attention comes near the end of the growing
season (about 4 months), as the plants mature.  To reproduce, the plants
(which by now are large bushes; about 4 feet tall and 3 feet across) send
up tall spikes, which will produce pink flowers.

The reproductive cycle, though, saps the plant's energy away from the
leaves, much as intact genitals will sap a bull's strength away from
meat development.  Therefore,  just as the rancher "steers" his bull
calves,  the grower will walk the fields, snapping off (sorry for the
imagery 8-) the spikes from all but a half-dozen (in my grandpa's case) 
plants, which will be allowed to produce the next year's seed.  

The plant, though, doesn't give up so easily.  Deprived of its family
jewels, it will produce small, stickly (high tar content, I suppose) 
buds near the severed stalk.  These "suckers" serve no useful purpose, but
divert energy, so they, too must be snapped off.  Typically, the flowering
and suckering operations will take place at three to five day intervals over
about 2-3 weeks; some plants will flower later than others.

We're now into August, and the plants are mature.   When the weather is
right (that is, dry and hot), and early in the morning, the plants are cut.
This is usually done by hand at Grandpa's; you walk along the row, bending
the plants over with the left hand to expose the base of the stalk (by now,
about an inch in diameter and very woody; about like ginger root, for those
Chinese cooks out there), while the right hand swings a cutting tool,
either a machete or an axe-like cutter.   The plants are left to lie on
their sides for several hours, until early afternoon; and only a few acres
are cut each day (that is, you only cut what you can take in).

The hot, dry weather is important; as it lies, the tobacco wilts from the
heat.  This greatly facilitates later handling, as "crisp" plants are far
more fragile.

Now comes the *really* labor-intensive part 8-)  A large field crew, fueled
by a typically-large farm dinner, goes out to the field.  A wagon is driven
alongside of the newly-cut tobacco, bearing a supply of "laths", strips of
wood (hickory is preferred, but oak is common) about 1/4"x1"x48" long on
the front, plus a couple of water jugs and a bucket of hard candy for the
workers.  About 4 spudders will walk, each covering two rows of tobacco;
they carry a hollow-backed steel spearpoint, or spud, which is placed on one end
of the lath, while the other is stuck against the ground.   The spudder
picks up a tobacco plant with one hand, and sits it on the spud point
(a task requiring a bit of deftness; the plants are a bit heavy to handly
one-handed, so you have to *swing* the stalk upward in an arc so that it
lands on the spud) about 4-6" below the cut end of the stalk.  Then, the
other hand is brought up to drive the plant onto the spud, and thus, 
the lath.  Plants are spudded 6-10 inches apart, depending on size.  When
the lath is full, the spudder hands it back to his/her "carrier", who
hands the spudder an empty lath, and takes the full one to the wagon, 
handing it up to the "stacker", who stacks it flat.  A stack of tobacco
one lath deep is called a "rick", and 3 ricks fill a wagon.

The laden wagon is then swapped for an empty one, and taken to to
tobacco shed, a tall barn with beam rafters spaced about 40" apart, just
right for suspending the laths.  In the shed, one worker unloads the wagon,
handing the full laths to another man standing in the rafters.  Depending
on the height of the barn, and horizontal distance from the wagon, the
lath may be passed several times before it is "hung".   The barn is hot and
dusty, which, along with the extra hazard or working in the rafters, earns
the shed crew bonus pay.  (I've never seen anyone fall from the beams,
though).  They then load fresh laths onto the wagon and return it to the
field crew.

A full crew for a typical day's work at Grandpa's would then be a field
tractor driver, a stacker, 4 spudders, 4 carriers, and a half-dozen
hangers, one of whom also drives a tractor; about 16 people all told.
It took about 6-8 such days over a two-week period to bring in all of
Grandpa's tobacco, weather permitting.

As has been mentioned, the tobacco shed has slats in the sideboards which
can be opened to vary air flow.  It will hang for several months until
it has cured.  What started as a succulent, green plant ends as a dried,
shriveled corpse; the leaves have the leather-brown look and paper-thin,
tough texture familiar to cigar smokers.

We're almost done now, but I'll taunt you with the exciting conclusion.
Stay tuned to this digest next week, same tobac-time, same tobac-channel.

Subject: A couple of questions.

I am very happy to see the amount of interesting traffic  in  our
small  mail  circle.  I  really  enjoy  the article about growing
tobacco (keep 'em comming).  I am  afraid  that  I,  like  Steve,
wouldn't know a tobacco plant from beans.  But I do love to smoke
the stuff in my pipes.  Which leads me to my first question.

When I first light my pipe is the best time to  enjoy  the  aroma
and  taste  of the tobacco.  When I get down to the bottom of the
bowl, a lot of the flavor is gone and I seem to be sucking ashes.
Is  there  a  good  way  to  smoke the tobacco all the way to the
bottom (got to get that heel cake established)  and  still  enjoy
the tobacco as if it were first lit?

My second question I hesitate to bring up because my  foolishness
might  have  cost me a  valuable possesion.  We have a local flea
market here which is on the parking lot of a  college  campus. It
is  held only once a month so there is still a pretty good mix of
household treasures along with the commercial junk.  While I  was
there  I kept my eye out for pipes.  I happened along a pipe that
was a cross between a freehand and a more standard pipe.  By this
I  mean that the bowlwas a freehand cube and the shank was square
flaring out towards the fitting end.  The stem  was  one  of  the
freehand  variety,  turned  and  not motised into the shank.  The
pipe was a Ben Wade and he was asking $25.

In the standard tradition of the flea market society,  I  offered
him  $15  for his pipe.  This guy was a non-conformist.  He stuck
to his original $25 price.  I left  and  went  around  the  whole
place.  A couple hours later, as I was leaving, I returned to his
booth and found that all his other pipes had been sold,  but  the
Ben  Wade  was still there.  I gave it one more pitch and offered
$20.  He still held on to his price, and  my  wife,  who  doesn't
smoke, was indifferent to the transaction.  I left in disgrace of
not having accomplished barganing skills (with the right person I
might  normally have gotten them to give me the pipe 8-&gt;).  Did I
miss a golden opportunity?

Smokin' the same old pipes in CA.

Subject: Norm's questions

I'm also glad we've been having some more activity here! I'll
contribute my share by answering Norm's questions (tho I might be
totally off base, in which case I'm sure someone will set me aright
(alight? :-)

Well, I almost never have the problem of the flavor being gone at the
bottom of a pipe - in fact, usually the reverse is true for me! (The
tobacco sometimes gets juicy and kind of rank.) 

But the fact that you're getting a lot of ash at the end implies that
you might be leaving the tobacco loose at the bottom of the bowl. Try
packing the bowl a little more firmly at the bottom and see if that
doesn't help.

Another possibility is that the tobacco has dried out and crumbled
into dust, as it often will when being bounced around in a pouch. The
only cure for that is to get some new!

Regarding the used Ben Wade, offhand it doesn't sound like you passed
up an outstandingly valuable pipe. Ben Wades retail in the range of
about $50 (or used to when I was buying a lot of pipes) - actually, I
think they're the brand name Stanwell uses to market their seconds.

Regardless of who made it or how much it originally cost, you can
approach used pipes as a collector or as a casual smoker. If I were
being casual about it, I'd look for a good deal the same way I would
if I were buying a new pipe (check fills, sand pits, grain appearance)
and look for damage (broken stem, cracks in the wood, burns around the
tobacco hole, scuffs, stains, spots, etc). A stem can be replaced (and
this would be a good bargaining point), but damage to the bowl is
harder to undo invisibly. Basically, don't buy a used pipe unless
you'd feel good doing so!

This reminds me of a rack of pipes I saw at a flea market a month or
two ago. These disabled veterans qualified as some of the most pitiful
specimens of pipedom - complete with house paint stains, burns
_through_ the bowls, cracks in shanks and stems, and every kind of
defect imaginable except living fleas. The price was marked at $35 for
an ugly rack full of unsmokable pipes. I looked at them, hoping for an
errant Dunhill, but they remained totally nondescript under close
scrutiny.  The owner, seeing what he took to be my interest, offered
to come down to $30. He may well remain their owner to this day. :-)

Of course, someone who's a serious collector will have to do a lot
more research about brand history - this gets into stuff like pre-
versus post- transition Barlings, Sasieni one-, four-, and eight-dots,
and like arcana about which I claim no expertise. Ben Rappaport wrote
a "Guide to Collecting Antique Pipes", which is still in print; this,
plus Hacker's book, are a start. But for noncollectors, I still
believe the rule is to buy what you'd like to smoke. That way, when
you buy, you'll...

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject:   Tobacco Roots IV - From Root to Cheroot

My memory of dates starts to fade on me... but in about November,
the hanging tobacco is cured.  Most of the water is dessicated away,
though the leaves should not be brittle.  At this point is is ready to
be "stripped" of its leaves.

Adjoining one of Grandpa's  tobacco sheds was the strip house; a
cement-block lean-to, with a wood-burning stove and ringed with benches.
Being cold weather, the stove was a necessity, of course.  Stripping
was "woman's work", which here, as on most farms, meant that everyone
helped, but the women kept at it when the men had other things to do 8-)

The laths of tobacco are brought down from the shed a few at a time; about
a day's worth.  The stalks are removed from the laths (the latter being
stored in a rack until the next season) and taken into the strip house.
There, the leaves are stripped off by hand into "hands", hand-sized
bunches.  Care is taken to keep the leaves flat, so they don't crease.
The leaves are sorted as they're stripped; damaged, worm-eaten, or overly-
dry leaves are segregated into the "trash" pile, the rest are carefully
packed into the baler.

The baler is a simple wooden box, about 4 feet long, a foot and a half
wide, and 2 feet or so deep.  The short ends are removable.  Three lengths
of twine string are laid in the baler, equally spaced along the length
of the box, with the ends handing over the long sides, then heavy brown paper
is laid over the strings to line the box.   The hands of tobacco are then 
laid in the box, their long direction parallel to the box's.  When the
baler is full, a top is placed on it; this has clamps attaching to
the bottom and levers to tighten it down, compressing the tobacco leaves.
The bale is "pressed" for about half an hour, then the top is removed, the
paper folded over, and the strings tied tight.  The sideboards are then
removed, and out comes a bale of tobacco, wrapped in paper and belted with
three strings.   This is stored in the shed.

When enough trash has been accumulated, it, too, is baled, and stored
separately.

The empty stalks are thrown in a manure spreaader and used as fertilizer.
They don't make great fertilizer, but you've got to do *something* with
them....

After that, the tobacco bales are trucked to a distributor.  As I
understand it (no personal experience here), some of them are then
opened for grading, and they are then auctioned to manufacturers.  The
quality leaves are used for wrapping cigars, while the poorer ones, 
including the trash, are ground for filler or pulped for juice for
the worst grade cigars.

That, then, is the story of Ohio-grown seed leaf.   There are, of course,
a number of other methods.  For example, in parts of New England it is
common to erect cheesecloth tents over the tobacco in the field, to
produce "shade-grown" tobacco.   Burley is a completely different beast;
for starts, it's much taller, six feet or so, and it requires a longer
growing season than Ohio provides.  I'm told Burley is stripped in the
field, with the leaves themselves being spudded onto laths for hanging.

As you've seen, tobacco is a very labor-intensive crop, not readily
suitable for automation.  Each leaf is valuable;  I can't say how much
is paid per pound of leaf, but I do know that Grandpa's two dozen or
so acres was his biggest cash crop.  Still, I would hazard that the
increase in minimum wages since my childhood has probably taken a big
bite out of that profit margin, which perhaps explains why I don't see much
tobacco being grown in tht area today.  Grandpa gave it up about 7 years
or so ago.

Subject: This ought to get a reaction...

I'm taking the liberty of reprinting the following from the October
newsletter of the New York Pipe Club, without immediate comment.

			    --==ooo==--

			"Say Yes To Pipes"

Join me in striking a blow against the sheep-like, anti-smoking
puritans. Pipe smoking is good for the smoker and good for society.
From my perspective, virulent anti-smokers are perverts who are not
interested in health (a subject about which they know nothing.)
Rather, the motivation of the anti-smoker is the exercise of power
over others. Since racial and religious prejudice is unfashionable,
these poor souls have their raison d'etre in railing against smokers.
Yielding to the inappropriate complaints of the power-seeking
anti-smokers merely encourages them. Are there three or four (or more)
club members who will join me in having dinner at a well-known
restaurant which has a pipe motif and yet frowns on smoking? As the
dinner begins, all of us would light up (in the smoking section, of
course). If the restaurant officials ask us to stop smoking, we would
refuse. At this restaurant, I anticipate that dinner would cost
approximately $25 to $30 per person. Phone me if you think you might
like to participate. [212-288-3832 - SPM.] We'll discuss details over
the phone.

[ Sailorman Jack is probably referring to Kean's English Chop House, a
NYC eatery which has adopted a no-smoking policy, despite its decor
(thousands of clay pipes, which formerly belonged to "members" of
Kean's). - SPM.]

Subject: What else do people (legally) put in pipes?

There have, of course, been pipes in the world for a long time;
probably since before the Neolithic Revolution. But tobacco smoking,
unless I am seriously misinformed, was restricted to the Americas
until the period of European colonization.

Now, in this period of waning tobacco use, I wonder what other herbs
might prove interesting (though I don't want to be *too* surprised!)
to throw in a pipe; for instance, my father always said that they tried
smoking tea leaves and corn silk when they were kids.  Any ideas,
folklore, personal experience? I remember seeing, briefly, something
called (roughly) "Herbal Smokes" in a tobacconist's once upon a time.
What about additives? I saw something called "Deer's Tongue (or was it
foot?) in that same shop; that was an herb, my good man Len explained,
put in for flavoring.

Coffee grounds, BTW, should be right out, IMHO.

Trivia Question: What did Sherlock Holmes smoke on Sundays?

Subject: Re:  Hope this gets through...

Not garbled.  A combination of Earthquake and being away from Unix for a
couple of weeks.  My system was acting funny yesterday and I entered mail
for the pipe message by accident.  I sent you the mail without realizing
what I had done until it was too late.  

On the pipe side,  I was in Italy on business 2 weeks ago and was looking
around for pipes.  There were a lot of beutiful samples there,  but not
that good a deal on price.  Does one of our group know what cities produce
pipes?

[ later, in reply to a letter I sent Norm asking him about the quake -- S. ]

Subject: After the 'quake
Status: R


We are all doing pretty good.  I haven't seen people around so shaken
up about an earthquake before.  We ride out 2 or 3 a year,  but they
never do this kind of damage.  Anyway,  none of my pipes got hurt.  One
casualty of the quake though may be Andre's pipe shop.  It is in downtown
Los Gatos and if it didn't fall down from the quake,  it might go under due
to lack of business.  People are staying away from where the more serious
problems occurred so merchants who are open aren't getting much patronage.

Hmmm, and what have *we* been smoking in our pipe, eh ?

And now for the real purpose:

I got a thing in the mail from some mail-order cigar company;
Thompson,or Thomas, or something like that.  I've seen and discarded
them before I started smoking stogies, but this time it caught my eye.

Basically, they offer a trial package of 40-odd cigars, in an assortment of
styles, for about ten bucks.  Images of a 25-cent cigar aside, does anyone
have any experience with these folks ?  None of their products seem to
be "whole leaf"; i.e., they use chopped filling, but I seem to recall
reading that they are all tobacco, no paper filling.

Subject: Other legal smokes, and tales of youth

Dave Davis writes:

&gt; Now, in this period of waning tobacco use, I wonder what other herbs
&gt; might prove interesting (though I don't want to be *too* surprised!)
&gt; to throw in a pipe; for instance, my father always said that they
&gt; tried smoking tea leaves and corn silk when they were kids.

I've tried both, again when I was a kid. Corn silk burns very hot; tea
leaves are just nasty (at least the ones in tea bags are - never tried
the loose variety.) I've also heard of people trying to get high by
smoking catnip. It apparently takes a large amount to feel any buzz
and is a very unpleasant smoke.

Cigarettes with clove or incense used to be popular in the 60s,
probably to cover the aroma of other types of burning vegetation. :-)
Never tried these; has anyone else?

I think that almost everyone who now smokes a pipe probably tried
"non-tobacco materials", as they say on the El Productos, when they
were kids. Which brings up another topic: how did y'all start smoking
a pipe? I'll go first.

I started pretty young. The first time I remember having a pipe in my
mouth was when I was about five. (No, it wasn't loaded at the time!)
There had been a cartoon on featuring a little character who had a
pipe from which issued not smoke, but _pies_ (got the pun?) Being an
imitative kid, I grabbed my father's dime-store straight bulldog and
put a piece of pie in it to see if I could repeat the feat. I don't
remember getting spanked for it :-)

Around 8 or so, I read "Tom Sawyer" and, again in imitation, started
trying to make my own.  I'd use corncobs, or a piece of 2x4, drilled
out with a spade bit and saber-sawed into a rough cylinder, with a
milkweed stem. I'd then get something to smoke in it (tea, loose
cigarette tobacco, and even sometimes "Old Briar" raided from my
father's pouch), and go out to a convenient woods and attempt to
smoke. The taste must have been phenomenally awful!

At about that time, a neighbor kid told me that he smoked his father's
pipes all the time. I believed him until I asked to watch him. He just
mumbled about not knowing when he was going to smoke. (My guess was it
wouldn't be for the next several years.) But until then, I was
properly envious!

I bought a pipe ostensibly for my dad's birthday when I was 13, but of
course I really wanted it for my own use. With some trepidation, I
announced this to my mom, who advised me to get my father's old pipe
and smoke it (expecting me to fall over coughing, no doubt!) Well, I
did so, nervously and without enjoying it much, but without obvious
ill effects (except much embarrassment!) Later, I kind of wished the
whole thing had never happened, and didn't smoke again for some time.
The new pipe was delivered to my dad, but I think he knew what was up.
:-) But I must admit I'm still a bit embarrassed to smoke around other
people, especially my folks.

My first "proper" pipe followed me at 15, and smoked it through the
final years of high school and my first time at college. I still have
it - like Brad Blumenthal's, it's shaped like ~\V, a typical teenage
wizard-in-training pipe. :-) (On the downside, it smokes hot and has a
thin shank which has now acquired a crack.) Though I don't smoke it
very much anymore, it remains my oldest friend among the briars.

Now that I'm all grown up (physically, anyway!) and may eventually
start a family, I sometimes wonder how I'll deal with them about
smoking. I'd want to avoid a double standard ("I can smoke but you
shouldn't!"), and I'd also want them to avoid cigarettes! So, if they
just had to smoke, I'd try to steer them toward a pipe (girls, too,
though I'd clue them in on the realities about being thought "wierd".
Personally, I don't think pipes are inherently masculine, and have
thought that the few female pipe smokers I've seen have brought it off
rather well. But this is digressing...)

Until they got to be of age, I think it would be proper to say,
"Smoking is really for grown-ups only, but I'd rather have you smoking
here with us than sneaking around. So, if you want to smoke, just come
and ask me to borrow one of my pipes. But it's to be pipes only, and
only in the house, and you've got to ask." (That is, unless I marry a
woman who smokes cigarettes, in which case, "pipes only" is going to
be tougher on the integrity.)

But all this is down the road. Do any of you have children? If so, how
do you deal (or plan to deal) with them about smoking? Please
follow-up if you can.

Until next time, then,

					Smoke in peace,

					~\U Steve.

Subject: Clays and churchwardens, Italian pipes

Greetings, gang! This 30th issue marks yet another "decade" in the
history of the pipes mailgroup, and I'm glad to see that we're still
generating some good discussions - and new members. Welcome to
Christopher M. Polk (???@??????.??.??????.???), who describes himself
as an "avid pipe smoker". Glad to have you aboard, Christopher!

And now, accompanied by a GBD bulldog and some John David's "African
Blend", I'll try to answer Norm's question about Italian pipemakers.
Of course, Savinelli, located im Milan, is probably the largest
Italian supplier to the U.S. market. Running through the pipe library,
here are some others of note. Where possible, I've put in locations or
contact addresses.

Arminelli:	Cucciago
Ascorti:
Baldo Baldi:	Contact GEMPI, PO Box 12521, Charleston, SC 29412
Becker:		Via della Panetteria 49 Rome
Bonfiglioli:	Via Piella 8/A, 40126 Bologna
Caminetto:	
Capitello:	Call Marble Arch, Ltd., 516-561-8555
Castello:	Cantu
Cesare:
Il Ceppo:	Call 800-523-1641
Sir Jacopo:
Lorenzo:
Paronelli:	Via del Chiostro, 5 - 20126 Gavvirate
Radice:		Brianza province (near Milan and Torino) - Marble Arch, Ltd.
Savinelli:	Milan
Talamona:	Call 800-292-CLUB

Caminetto, Ascorti, and Radice have some history in common ("Pipe
Smoker", July 1987 - let me know if you want a copy of the article.)
There's also a briar sawmill you might want to visit in Sassetta (Jan
'87). 

You might also want to visit Claudio Rebecchi's "Tobacco Museum" (P.O.
Box 5, 41100 Modena 10, Italy) - good photos in the July 1989 "Pipe
Smoker".

And furthermore, Italy has several active pipe clubs you might write
to:

Amici Della Pipa, Casella Postale 01734, Roma Eur
Dirieffe Pipe Club, Davide Piva, Via. G. di Vittorio, 7/b, 30170 
	Mestre, Venezia
Extra-Extra, Corso Vittorio Emanuele 37/B, 20122 Milano
Fortunato, Casella Postale 10374 Roma
La Pipa (contact J.M. Alberto Paronelli, above)
Museo Italiano Della Pipa, Via Della Chiostro 5, 21026 Gavirate (Varese)
Smoking, Via della Colonna Antonina, 35, 00186 Roma

(Gee, Italy seems to be _overrun_ with pipe makers! I guess it's a
cottage industry there, even though most of them distribute through
sole sources [which is why there are so many "Contact so-and-so's" in
the addresses]. Further information or corrections are welcome. Good
hunting, Norm!)

			     --==ooo==--

And now, a few questions of my own:

- Where the heck can I find a quality churchwarden these days? No one
seems to be making them anymore! Does anyone out there smoke one? They
look like fun, even if you do have to use extra-extra-long cleaners!

- Does anyone own a clay pipe? I just got a catalog from Lepeltier
(Box 61, East Fairfield, VT 05448) - they make a line of double-walled
clays that have about the same shape as briar pipes, and which they
purport to smoke cooler. At $15, it's a fairly cheap experiment, but
your comments would be appreciated!

Now, I really should finish the GBD and get cracking for my Ph.D exam.
Hope to hear from y'all (Southern - NJ equivalent, "yous" :-) soon! In
the meantime, keep the home briars burning.

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

Just a few notes I've accumulated over the past few weeks:
___
Andre's Pipe Gallery in Los Gatos was, as Norm speculated, closed by the
earthquake.  Its building is red-tagged, meaning that for the time being
people aren't allowed.  There's a strong preservationist feeling in L. G.,
though, and the building might be restored.

Locals should be aware that most of Los Gatos in open for business and could
use your support.
___
As long as I'm on quaky ground, I should mention the late lamented Union
Cigar store, formerly of Santa Cruz.  It was around since early this century.
At the front it had magazines on the left and tobacco on the right.  Deep
in the back was a section dealing in fishing tackle, including high-quality
custom-made rods.  One charming feature was an open gas jet at the front,
to light your cigars at.

Four or five years ago, the fire-insurance boys shut down the gas flame.
About two years ago, the store closed.  Last month, its building was destroyed
by the earthquake.  Sic transit gloria mundi.

___
During the 60's, I smoked some eucalyptus a few times.  The idea was to
smooth out the smoking qualities of some (ahem) other stuff that was popular
in those days.  

Didn't work, though.  Imagine smoking Vapo-Rub.  Imagine smoking Vapo-Rub while
in a giggly mood anyway.  Imagine giggling away all that expensive smoke...

___
Most of us, particularly when stoking our pipes from plastic bags, have been
teased about the possibility of our using non-tobacco products. ("No wonder
you look so happy," etc.)

According to the San Francisco Examiner, a bailiff in Sacramento wasn't kidding
last September.  When passing lawyer stubbed out his Honduras Repeater cigar,
the cop got suspicious and told the judge that the attorney was smoking weed.

Further study of the butt exonerated the barrister.  Last I heard, he
was asking for a mistrial.

___ 
I have tried Thompson cigars.  The cheapos are just that.  They also
have decent long-filler cigars for reasonable prices.

Their service is excellent.  I sent some cigars back; the refund was prompt and
included postage.


__
Till next time,

Subject: Slack

It's been a good week for new members! Welcome to Neal Silbert
(????@????.????????.???) and Jim Keegan (??????@???.??.???). Write in
when you can, and good smoking to both of you!

Also, toward the end of this missive, I've inserted a piece of ASCII
art (remember that?) which I found on alt.slack, and which might be of
interest to pipeists and Bobists alike.

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

&gt; Welcome to
&gt; Christopher M. Polk (???@??????.??.??????.???), who describes himself
&gt; as an "avid pipe smoker". 

I used to smoke an Avid, but I gave it up for a Ben Wade.  Welcome aboard,
Chris !

&gt; - Where the heck can I find a quality churchwarden these days? No one
&gt; seems to be making them anymore! Does anyone out there smoke one? They
&gt; look like fun, even if you do have to use extra-extra-long cleaners!

They are fun, though don't expect to do any walking around.  I have a
churchwarden made by a local pipesmith, T.M. West.  Haven't been to his
shop since he moved to a high-class mall downtown, but I can call and
furnish an address if you want to mail order one.  I can vouch that Tim's
pipes are (at least, *were*) of good quality, so you wouldn't be taking
a big risk.

Mighty nice for watching Star Trek or reading a book; the pipe bowl
rests in my lap, and is just right for cradling in the palm of my
hand without having to raise my arm 8-)
 
Thanks for the info about Thompson's.  I think I'll order their trial
pack and give'em to people I don't like, then order some long leaf stuff
for myself 8-)

&gt; Thanks for the info about Tim West; I have his address (like Sherwin Williams,
&gt; I cover the world!) How much, if I might inquire, did it set you back?
&gt; Did you get one with a smooth or a rough surface?

I bought it, oh, 6 years ago; I think I paid $35 at the time.  The
churchwardens I've seen have all been relatively inexpensive; I guess
because they tend to be small-bowled pipes, and so require less briar.

Mine has a smooth surface;  I detest rough (sandblasted) surfaces, though
I can tolerate rough-carved surfaces.   I'd rather have a smooth surface
with a few pits and fills...  (my churchwarden, BTW, had neither that I
could detect.

I bought my first Tim West pipe when he ran his shop out of a little
place called Monkey's Retreat; it featured a comic/underground magazine
store, a "head shop", and Tim's pipe store in the back.  It was very close
to Ohio State, and I bought a curved-stem apple from him in 1980.  It's
still my favorite pipe, despite the fact that a large chip was broken off
the bowl rim after I dropped it.  (I took it in to have it re-stemmed,
(not at Tim's), and the shopkeeper suggested it was a waste of money on
such a damaged pipe.  "Just *do* it," I told him. 8-)

		 Pipes Digest #32 - December 24, 1989

Today is a lot of different days - the day before Christmas (or X-mess
for us Grinches), the 2^5 issue of the Digest, and the day we welcome
a new member, Bart (or Pestilence (I print 'em as they come in,
folks!)), who's also new to the pipe. I'll get out my Ben Wade and
join you in a smoke, B/P!

Bill, thanks for the words on Tim West. I've written him a letter
asking for a price quote - so far no reply, but I said not to hurry,
so that's not surprising. In the meantime, I discovered that both
Peterson and Savinelli make churchwardens, and have found a source for
the Sav's for about $30. Not bad! I have to take issue about smooth
vs. rough surfaces, though... I have an oversized carved-surface bent
I bought from Connoisseur in NYC, and it's now one of my favorite
pipes. Rough surfaces make it possible to afford good quality briar,
sans fills. The textures can be interesting (though I admit birds-eye
is pretty), and the pipe acquires a patina as it is smoked and
handled. However, I'm still too proud to buy a pipe which has been
lacquered. Never have owned a sandblast, so I can't comment on my
prejudices owing to not having any. :-)

As some of you may know, "Pipe Smoker and Tobacciana Trader" folded
last month - bought by the Old Virginia Tobacco Company (publishers of
"Smoker's Pipeline.") People are being encouraged to convert their
subscriptions, and they've sent out a preliminary issue of S.P. Can't
say I'm thrilled with what I've seen (they seem to aim at collectors,
especially those into buying perfect pipes at $250 and then leaving
them on the shelf! Talk about conspicuous consumption!) But I'll
suspend judgment until I see their full Xmas issue, which should be
coming out in early January (!).

Also, I must admit that I sometimes read one of the "alt" newsgroups
associated with hedonistic use of "certain substances." I have noticed
a lot of surprising (and I think hypocritical) anti-tobacco arguments
there, along the lines of "&lt;Substance&gt; killed 3000 people last year,
cigarettes killed 300,000, so we should legalize &lt;substance&gt; and
outlaw tobacco." Yes, tobacco is a d**g, but cigarettes are not the
only way to use it. Cigarettes are to pipes as guzzling beer is to
sipping fine wine - and are a dangerous and highly addictive form at
that. To conclude this missive, I don't mind if those guys have their
favorite herbs legal, just so mine is too. Like anything else with
some danger potential, it's all in how you handle it - if you can
enjoy a cigarette every now and then without getting addicted, I'll
light up my pipe and join you.

If any of you read this before Christmas, please let me know - I'm
just curious. And if you do, I hope you'll find a good friend on
Christmas day, and join him or her under the tree for a pipeful of
your best.

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Subject: Re:  Requesting membership to pipes.

Well, to be honest, I haven't been into pipe smoking very long (and probably
by many standards, I have started yet).  In the middle of this summer, I was
walking around a drug store near where I live, and I  saw about 15 different
kinds of pipes.  Seeing as I was almost always completely broke at the time,
there was only 1 pipe I could buy: (yes, I know you guys are probably laughing
already but...) a Dr. Grabow corn-cob pipe and some Borkum Riff cherry
blend tobacco. :-)  I didn't even get a tamper until last week (either when
I had the money, I couldn't find one, or when I was broke, I couldn't).

Anyway, even this li'l corn-cob (told to me to be a good beginner's pipe) does
give me sufficient smoking pleasure, so when I heard about this newsgroup, I
jumped on the chance to join so I could find out the best that I can get (yep,
finally got a job).  I love spending time walking around the nearest pipe
shop (a "Tinder Box" at a nearby mall).

Well, that's about all I can think of at the time.  That and I'm very happy
to be in this little group (little? no idea how big).

Later, all . . .

Hello,
	Sorry it's so close to the holidays, but I just wanted to ask

network somewhere (has happened before, alas).
	Anyway, sorry to bother you.  Happy smoking!

[ Bart - Congratulations on your admission to the Order of the
Smoldering Bowl (Corncob Coterie)! Plagarize away, too - whatever
lights yer baccy. Readership hasn't gone down - I only remove people
when they request it or when their mail repeatedly bounces and I can't
contact them. Talkership, however, has declined some recently. There's
only one cure for that, though... to put in yer own two scents (make
one of mine Latakia and the other Virginia :-), as you've just done.

Well, to settle your curiosity, I received the digest at 4:43pm on x-mess-eve.
(yup, I'm a Grinch too :-)

Also, perfect timing for the Digest too!  Right on my birthday!  Thanx!

Well, talk to ya sometime... Happy smoking!
~\U - Bart

ps. Got my friend an "Omega"-style pipe for x-mess, and he loves it!  We may
have another member soon. . .

[ To which I replied: "What's an Omega?" And he said... ]

Thanx.

It's a Dr. Grabow "Omega" pipe.  At least that's what the box called it.
To me, it looked like a standard, bent-style, Sherlock Holmes pipe. :-)

I take it Dr. Grabow is not the company I should be learning all my pipe
trivia and information from, eh?

Subject: Calling Dr. Grabow, Dr. Fine, Dr. Grabow ...

&gt; I take it Dr. Grabow is not the company I should be learning all my pipe
trivia and information from, eh?

Hey, as long as you like to smoke it, it's fine. But if it has a lacquer
or paint outer finish, you'd probably be better off with a good "second"
from your local pipe shop. The cost shouldn't be all that much different.
If there's lacquer inside the bowl, don't even smoke the thing (yeech!
I can't really believe there are people who do things like that to an
innocent briar, but it's a fact that there are!)

Also, there's a shop in NYC called the "Connoisseur" that sells good-quality
pipes in the $30-40 range. These are either carved or smooth; the smooth
ones may show some surface flaws. Also, another shop called "With Pipe
and Book" in upstate NY has a nice assortment of pipes in the $25 range.
I'm away from the addresses, but if you're interested let me know and I'll
mail them to you. Both places take mail orders and put out catalogs.

Lastly, don't knock Dr. Grabow out of hand (unless you have a cork knocker :-)
Kaywoodies used to be thought of as a "drugstore" pipe, now the old ones
are collector's items.

~\U Steve.

[ For those others who are interested:

Connoisseur Pipe Shop, Ltd.

NY NY 10036
(Their "Turkish Black is verrah nice - Thanks, Elias!)

Y'know, this reminds me of my college days.  As I mentioned, Tim West
used to share a store with, among other things, a "head shop", so that,
while perusing his fine briars, I also discovered a wide variety of
"alternative", er, utensils.

Among these were, of course, "bongs" (bhangs), those little water pipes
with tiny bowls suitable for only the most powerful smokes... latakia,
I presume 8-)  These, in turn, made me think of a full-sized Indian 
hooka, the floor-model water pipe with, I think, a generous sized bowl,
intended for tobacco.

Has anyone ever smoked pipe tobacco from any of these, or other, water
pipes ?  There would seem to be certain advantages, portability not
being among them.

&gt;blend tobacco. :-)  

Well, no comment on the cherry blend, but there's nothing wrong with a
corncob !   Best smoke this side of $20 !  Never smoked a Grabow cob
(or *any* Grabow, for that matter; if I want something filtered, I drink
beer 8-) , but a $3 Missouri Meerschaum is tough to beat.

In addition to being a fine smoke for the money, a corncob has several
other advantages.  It's light; it cools quickly between smokes; and if
it falls out of your pocket somewhere on the back forty, it's no big deal.

It just doesn't go well with a 3-piece suit... 8-)

catalog, above, has a nice collection of brass water pipes with
braided hoses. Check it out. I've had no experience with a hookah
myself (you never know what you'll catch :-), but I've heard they make
for a cool, and somewhat noisy smoke. ]

Subject: Flea market relic or gimick!

I was at one of our local flea markets yesterday (nope, not a single Ben Wade
in the lot).  I happened on a guy who was getting rid of some of his pipe
smoking things.  One item caught my eye.  It was a pipe pump.  Anyone ever
hear of this thing before?  It lets you clamp the stummel up against a device
that looks something like a small bicycle pump.  Then you pump your pipe and
(as the add claims) you have a cleaner and fresher pipe "just like new".

Anybody know about this thing?

Norm

&gt; ... (unless you have a cork knocker :-)

Again, I'm gonna apologize for asking what are probably silly questions, but
I'm new to this and the terminology is somewhat confusing.  What is a
"cork knocker"?

&gt; ... Connoisseur Pipe Shop, Ltd.
&gt; ... With Pipe and Book
&gt; ... Levin Pipes International

I just got a catalogue from Connoisseur and With Pipe and Book, thanx for
the addresses, Steve!  Now's the fun-time which I spend alot of time (and
most probably cash :-) to find my preferences.

&gt; Well, no comment on the cherry blend, but there's nothing wrong with a
&gt; corncob !   Best smoke this side of $20 !

May I ask you a question? (well, you can't answer now, so I'll ask anyway :-)
Is there a time which you should replace the ol' corncob?  The taste I'm
getting towards the bottom of the bowl is really starting to get strange
even tho' I clean the pipe and change the filter often.  Again, sorry for
asking what is quite probably a silly question, but hey, what can I say?

Later all,
- Bart (Pestilence... [it's an old in-joke w/some friends, in case anyone's
  wondering])

[ A cork knocker is: (a) a small knob, made of cork, that goes in the
bottom of an ashtray to hit a pipe against to knock out the ashes; (b)
someone who goes around badmouthing bottle stoppers; or (c) a device
used by a vain woman to get attention she doesn't deserve, usually
worn in pairs :-) -S. ]

Subject: Back again...

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

  Sorry for being away from our mailgroup for such a long time. As you
probably remember I just moved from a quite academic life into a
pretty hectic professional life. No complaints, except lack of time to
write to the mailgroup.

  Before I started my new job, I went to Brazil for what I consider a
well deserved one-month vacation/visit to my family. It was very
relaxing. Yes I did bring some very nice cigars, but unfortunately
Brazil is still far from having good pipe tobacco.

  Now let's talk about what is really important: pipes. Since I got
back from Brazil I have added some good pipes to my collection, that
seems to be growing steadly. The first one was my first carved pipe.
It is an Armellini, curved stem. I found it in a mall pipe store, and
I was amazed to see Armellini there, and even better, with a very nice
price. In another mall (I moved to NJ and I only see malls...), I
found a pipe store with good pipes but well over priced. They were
having a sale though, with some very nice Danish pipes made by a man
called Preben Holm, who according to the salesman, which seemed to
know a pretty good deal about pipes, passed away just a few months
ago. I bought two of his pipes, one carved and one smooth surface with
a very nice grain.

   Just a few days ago I went to NYC for a demo of the product our
company represent and decided to go to the pipe shop by the restaurant
'La Bonne Soup' where the NYC pipe club meet every month. As walked
into the pipe shop I bumped into Mr. Sailorman Jack, responsible for
the NYC club. We had a very pleasant conversation while I looked for a
pipe, and the sales person in the shop gave me some of his personal
tobacco mixture, an English blend on Latakia, Perique, Virginia and
some cigar leafs. Very strong but very interesting. The store is
located on the 55th street, between 5th and 6th Ave. I ended up buying
a very large pipe made by an American pipe maker, whose name I can't
remember now.

    I found a very intersting piece of pipe culture that I would like
to share with the group. One of my work colleagues is very interested
in the Sherlocke Holmes literature, and as we were talking about it
the other day he mentioned he had a annotated book about Sherlock
Holmes, which he brought the next day. I was browsing through the book
and found this very interesting note about a passage in the case 'The
Gloria Scott':

    "'Then he lit his pipe'. In his scholarly monograph on Holmes and
Tobacco ("No Fire Without Smoke"), Mr John L. Hicks has written that:
"No one can seriously doubt that the Master preferred a pipe to cigars
and cigarettes. He smokes a pipe in thirty-five of the sixty cases in
the Canon, probably does in three others and in still another talks
about his pipe without, as far as the reader knows, actually lighting
it. He smokes nothing but a pipe in twenty-nine.[...] Briar, clay and
cherrywood are ... the only ones mentioned in the Sacred Writings...
Most admirers of Sherlock Holmes have believed that his favorite pipe
was made of clay, ... but evidence supports the theory that Holmes
liked a briar pipe better than any other kind.
     It will be noted that neither Holmes nor Watson ever mentioned a
pipe with a curved stem; indeed, Mr. John Dickinson Carr has stated
that the curved pipe was unknown in England until the time of the
Boer War (1889). Why, then has the curved pipe - a calabash or a
meerschaum for example- become a Holmesian trademark? Because Gilette,
in playing the role of Holmes, found it difficult to speak his lines
with a straight pipe between his lips."


  Well, I'm happy I finally found some time to write to the mailgroup
again. I will try to keep it up.

  Smoke in peace. ~\U

for you, and that we'll continue to get reports on the NYPC. -S. ]
