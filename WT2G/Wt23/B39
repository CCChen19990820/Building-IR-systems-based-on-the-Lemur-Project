To Our Shareholders:

<P>

	The Company is pleased to report net income for the third quarter ended August 31, 1996 of $385,000 or $.01 per share on revenues of $33.4 million, compared to net income of $1.0 million or $.04 per share on revenues of $60.4 million for the same period in 1995. The decrease was primarily attributable to a substantial decline in homes delivered in the Northeast division as a result of the backlog level entering the year due to the reduction in the number of communities open for sales after the consolidation of operations over a year ago, and the effect of deliveries from six communities that are winding down and will be substantially complete by the end of 1996. In addition, the Northeast division has faced a general weakening of housing activity in its markets. The Florida division  increased home deliveries by fifty-four percent (54%) and housing revenues of seventy-seven percent (77%) over the same period of 1995. These improvements reflect an increase in the number of communities open for sales and an expansion of the Florida division's product line to include higher-priced homes ranging up to $197,000. Also included in the third quarter results is the pretax profit from the sales of land and commercial land and buildings of $762,000, reflecting management's continued focus on the sale of non-homebuilding assets.

<P>

	For the nine months ended August 31, 1996 the Company incurred a net loss of $558,000 on revenues of $81.5 million as compared to net income of $317,000 on revenues of $137.4 million for the nine months ended August 31, 1995. The decreases are attributable to fewer deliveries due to the decline in the number of communities open for sales in the Northeast division. The Florida division continues to deliver at increased levels from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the number of communities open for sales. Management continues to realize cost savings by reducing selling, general and administrative costs and interest expense associated with lower debt levels.

<P>

	The Company's sales backlog totalled 208 homes with an aggregate dollar value of $42.0 million at August 31, 1996 compared to 249 homes having an aggregate dollar value of $54.6 million. The backlog levels are indicative of fewer communities open for sales and a general weakness in housing activity in the markets served in the Northeast. The number of homes reflected in net sales increased by nine percent (9%) to 418 homes for the nine months ended August 31, 1996 as compared to 385 homes for the nine months ended August 31, 1995. The softness in the Northeast was offset by a sixty-four percent (64%) increase in home sales in the Florida division, primarily due to an increase in the number of communities open for sales. Net sales totalled $83.3 million and $84.1 million for the nine months ended August 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, reflecting the higher proportion of Florida division activity where average sales prices are lower than in the Northeast.

<P>

	The Company opened a total of six communities for sales during the nine months ended August 31, 1996, one in the Northeast and five in the Florida division. Management anticipates opening two additional communities in the Northeast and four communities in the Florida division during the fourth quarter of 1996.

<P>

	We are grateful to our employees for their continued commitment to building quality and value into the Company's products and to you, our shareholders, for your support. Management continues to focus on reducing the level of debt outstanding thus lowering interest incurred, thereby, increasing profitability. This strategy has resulted in the lowest level of debt outstanding in over ten years.

<P>

Sincerely,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Stockholders:

<P>

During the second quarter, CardioGenesis’ first operating quarter as a publicly traded company, we achieved a number of significant operating goals including the European CE mark approval for commercialization of our ITMR® products, approval of our investigational device exemption (IDE) for a Phase II study in no option patients, and the move to our new combined office, research and manufacturing facility in Sunnyvale, California.

<P>

Sales for the quarter ended June 30, 1996, were $1.2 million and consisted primarily of laser sales with some probe sales included.  Gross profit on those sales was $330 thousand.  Operating expenses for the second quarter were approximately $2.6 million, as research and development and sales and marketing expenses ramp up and we prepare for a product introduction in the fall.  We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet reflecting the net proceeds of approximately $55 million from our initial public offering completed on May 21, 1996.

<P>

Key to our European product launch strategy was the receipt of the European Community CE mark, which provides the regulatory approval necessary to market our ITMR products in Europe.  The CE mark is awarded to companies whose products meet the essential requirements of the European Medical Device Directive.  We are currently devoting considerable resources to increase our sales and marketing presence in Europe.

<P>

On the clinical front, we received an IDE approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin a US Phase II randomized study in no option patients -- those with severe coronary artery disease for whom existing therapies cannot be used.  Patient enrollment activities are underway for this trial.  Most recently, on August 12, we announced FDA approval to begin a major new clinical trial of up to 500 patients to study our ITMR System as an adjunctive therapy to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

<P>

An important focus for the company is the development of our Percutaneous Myocardial Revascularization (PMR®) System.  The PMR technique, performed by interventional cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory, is a minimally-invasive catheter-based procedure in which the heart is accessed by directing a catheter through the femoral artery, over the aortic arch, into the left ventricle, and delivering laser energy through a flexible fiber optic catheter into the wall of a beating heart.  We believe PMR may be a less invasive, less traumatic and more cost-effective approach to treating coronary artery disease.  We anticipate that US human clinical trials with the PMR System will begin by the end of the year.

<P>

As we enter the third quarter, we will continue to invest appropriately in basic science, our clinical trial programs, and development of the sales infrastructure necessary to support our European product launch.  Thank you, our stockholders, for your continuing interest and support in CardioGenesis.

<P>
<font size=-1>CardioGenesis, based in Sunnyvale, California, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary systems, including disposable components, to preform surgical and catheter-based percutaneous transmyocardial revasularization (TMR). TMR involves the use of laser energy to create channels in the oxygen-starved regions of the heart muscle. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and Europe, and the company estimates there are more than 500,000 patients annually in key markets who could potentially benefit from TMR therapy. CardioGenesis’ common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the Symbol CGCP.

<B>Third Quarter Fiscal Year 1996 Earnings Release:</B>

<P>

Fort Worth, Texas (October 17, 1996) - - Cash America International, Inc. (NYSE:PWN) announced today that net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 increased 116% to $3,463,000 (12 cents per share) compared to $1,603,000 (6 cents per share) for the same period in 1995.  The increase in earnings is attributed to higher loan balances outstanding throughout the quarter, as well as operating efficiencies achieved through enhanced inventory management. Total revenue for the three month period was 12% higher in 1996, reaching $64,674,000 compared to $57,636,000 in 1995.

<P>

Loan balances as of September 30, 1996 were up 20% in relation to the same date in the prior year, reaching $104.6 million, while inventory balances decreased 13%, to $51.3 million, over the same period. Commenting on the results for the third quarter, Jack R. Daugherty, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said,  "The growth in our loan portfolio is the result of more individual loans outstanding, not from an increase in the average size of new loans, leading to the conclusion that Cash America is increasing its customer base and market penetration. For the first time in our Company’s history we have eclipsed the $100 million milestone in loans outstanding.  In addition, we have experienced a significant increase in inventory turnover during fiscal 1996 which should allow us to continue our emphasis on satisfying the loan needs of our customers."

<P>

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net income rose 28% to $9,443,000 (33 cents per share) versus $7,377,000 (26 cents per share) for the same period in the prior year, before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 1995.  Total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 was $199,141,000 compared to $178,003,000 in 1995, representing a 12% increase.

<P>

Cash America International, Inc. is the market leader in the specialty finance segment of secured, non-recourse loans to individuals, commonly known as pawn loans.  The Company operated 380 pawnshops world-wide as of September 30, 1996, with 333 locations in the United States, 37 in the United Kingdom and 10 in Sweden.<P>

<P>


Palo Alto, California, October 15, 1996 -- C•ATS Software Inc. (NASDAQ: CATX) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996.
Net revenue for the third quarter of 1996 decreased 15 percent to $4,903,000 from the $5,775,000 reported for the third quarter of 1995.  The company reported a net loss for the third quarter of 1996 of $172,000, or $0.03 per share, as compared to net income of $863,000, or $0.14 per share, reported for the third quarter of 1995.
<P>

Net revenue for the first nine months of 1996 decreased 5 percent to $15,670,000 from the $16,424,000 reported for the first nine months of 1995.  The net loss for the first nine months of 1996 was $6,275,000, or $0.97 per share, compared to net income of $2,518,000, or $0.42 per share, for the first nine months of 1995.  The loss for 1996 includes a one time charge to in-process research and development of $7,066,000 in connection with the first quarter acquisition of LOR/Geske Bock Associates, Inc.
<P>

"The third quarter continued as a period of investment for the company," said Rod Beckström, CEO and Chairman of the Board.  "Emphasis on product development resulted in the full production release of C•atalyst version 2.2, as well as CARMA version 2.0 going into beta test prior to the end of the quarter.  This new version of the CARMA enterprise-wide risk management product represents the most significant enhancements since its first release nearly three years ago," continued Beckström.  "Release 2.0 is architected as a three-tier client/server application, with Windows NT client and both Unix and Windows NT server platforms.  The new release supports relational databases, and includes graphic visualization of risk analytics and a data bridge to C•atalyst as well as other legacy systems, which will provide C•ATS clients with integration from their trading desk to enterprise-wide risk management."
<P>

"The company also continued to make strides during the quarter in penetration of emerging financial markets, with the signing of a contract with another major Korean bank for the implementation of C•atalyst," Beckström continued.  "C•ATS’ leadership position in derivatives trading systems has allowed the company to take advantage of the opportunity arising from the pending deregulation and internationalization of the Korean financial markets."

<CENTER><B>CEPHALON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

	West Chester, PA -- November 5, 1996 --  Cephalon, Inc. (NASDAQ: CEPH) today reported a loss of $16.6 million, or $.68 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 1996, compared to a loss of $4.6 million, or $.22 per share, for the same period in 1995.  Revenues for the 1995 third quarter were $19.2 million, which included a non-recurring $14.1 million payment
from Chiron Corp. to equalize its funding under the company’s agreement with Chiron for the development of MyotrophinÒ (rhIGF-1) for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and peripheral neuropathy.  Revenues for the 1996 quarter were $3.6 million and included revenues under agreements with Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Schering-Plough Corp., SmithKline Beecham and TAP Holdings, Inc.

<P>

	During the 1996 third quarter Cephalon had operating expenses of $21.9 million compared to $28.4 million during the same period last year.  The decrease in expenses reflected an $8.8 million reduction in research and development costs primarily due to the completion of certain clinical trials.  This reduction was offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses over the 1995 period, reflecting expansion of marketing and sales activities in the United States and Europe.

<P>

	For the nine month period ended September 30, 1996 the company reported a loss of $48.4 million, or $2.00 per share, compared to a loss of $21.2 million, or $1.10 per share, for the same period in 1995.

<P>

	At the end of the third quarter Cephalon had approximately $145 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

<P>

	Cephalon, Inc., headquartered in West Chester, PA, is an international biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and markets products to treat neurological disorders.  The company is developing products for the treatment of ALS, narcolepsy, peripheral neuropathies, Alzheimer’s disease, head and spinal injury, and stroke, and currently copromotes two products in the United States for the treatment of neurological conditions.

<B>Report on the 1996 Annual Meeting of Shareholders</B>


<P>

To Our  Shareholders:

<P>

I am pleased to announce that the shareholders of Target Technologies, Inc. met on August 2, 1996, and overwhelmingly approved a change of the Company’s name to C-Phone Corporation.  We believe that this change will help to more closely identify the Company with our C-Phone video conferencing family of products.  The Nasdaq National Market is expected to reflect the name change within the next few days.  The trading symbol "CFON" remains the same.  Additional matters voted on and approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders were the re-election of the Board of Directors and the engagement of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. as the Company’s independent auditors for fiscal 1997.

<P>

I reported that sales are increasing both domestically and internationally as more and more proof of concept and pilot projects begin.  I announced that a new C-Phone video product  for the home market is expected to  be introduced shortly.

<P>

Shareholders expressed concern over the decline in our stock price which began in late June.  My discussion of this matter focused on two issues.  First, I talked about our stock price as it relates to the activities of our Company.  Secondly, I discussed the general stock market condition during the period when our stock price declined.  On the first issue,  C-Phone Corporation continues to be a development stage company. Accordingly, our stock price is largely based on what the market perceives our  future to be, as opposed to price/earnings ratios and other factors used to value more mature companies. I stated that the Company’s future continues to look promising and that I could not link specific events within our Company to  the drop in the stock price.  On the second issue, I discussed the general market condition during the period when our Company’s stock price declined.  Our shareholders were well aware of the drop in the stock market earlier this summer and the effect that it had on many companies, especially small-cap Nasdaq technology companies.  No one disputed that this adversely affected our stock as well.

<P>

Shareholders asked about our cash position and its impact on continuing operations of our Company.  My response discussed our current financial position, which indicated that we will be able to operate well into the next fiscal year and that our cash utilization rate decreased substantially in June and July.  Additionally, I reported that we are beginning discussions regarding future financial planning with several investment banking firms.

<P>

The conclusion of my presentation stressed that the selling effort continues to be our main focus. I reported that we engaged the executive search firm of Heidrick & Struggles, to help recruit a high level executive with the experience necessary to meet our sales goals. I am pleased to announce that effective September 3, 1996, David DeSimone will be our Vice President of Sales and Marketing. David will join us after a 16-year career with MCI where he held various sales and marketing management positions.

<P>

Thank you for your continued support.  Your Board of Directors joins me in reconfirming our commitment to the success of C-Phone.  We are keenly aware that our job is to create value of  our  Company for you and all of our Shareholders.

<P>

Very truly yours,

<a name="letter"><h3>Letter to Shareholders:</h3></a>
<blockquote>Dear Shareholder,<P>

There has been an array of exciting news in recent weeks on Chase Resource Corporation, a company in which our records show that you are currently a shareholder.<P>
 
The purpose of this communication is to provide a brief update, and to tell you about a new service that insures you will be kept more closely informed on your investment going forward.<P>

One of the World's Largest Undeveloped Orebodies<P>
 
Chase Resource Corporation’s Taysan Copper/Gold Project is now recognized as encompassing one of the largest undeveloped copper-gold ore bodies in the world. Estimated proven and probable reserves are over 336 million tonnes of ore grading .31% copper and .30 grams per tonne gold; that translates into a proven and probable reserve of 3.8 million ounces of gold and 3.6 billion pounds of copper.  And that is only the beginning:  there are additional reserves of over 200 million tonnes of similar grades and drill results from 1995 suggest additional higher grade reserves near surface.<P>
 
In December of 1995 the company signed an extremely favorable agreement with Magma Copper to jointly develop the property.  This agreement was then assumed by BHP, one of the world’s largest mining companies, as part of their recent take-over of Magma.<P>
 
Under the agreement, Chase retains a 49% working interest and a 3% net smelter royalty in the Taysan project.  If a mine is brought to production, BHP is obligated to arrange for project financing and to advance up to 50% of Chase’s equity participation.  This is an excellent agreement for Chase as it means Chase shareholders will suffer little, if any, dilution in order to take the project into production phase.<P>
 
The strength of the BHP relationship is supported by the fact that they now hold 2,500,000 shares of Chase (15.8% of outstanding shares).  In the March 1996 edition of Markets and Mining, editor Dr. Richard S. Appel concluded his analysis of Chase's prospects by stating:<P>
 
In summary, Chase is led by experienced and previously successful mining people.  It  is extremely well capitalized and its flagship property, Taysan, alone can make this company.  Their association with BHP, through their agreements with Magma Copper, lend financial strength and expertise typically absent from a junior resource company.  I believe that 1996 will be an extremely successful year for Chase Resources Corp.<P>

Corporate Valuation<P>

 Using a discounted cash flow analysis, the Taysan project alone has a Net Present Value of approximately US$250 million.  The actual liquidation value "as is" would be on the order of US$100 million, or Cdn$130 million.  The company has no debt and holds in its treasury approximate cash of Cdn$10 million (about $0.70 per share) as well as 750,000 shares of Delta Gold Mining Corp, currently valued at approximately Cdn$1,200,000.00.<P>
 
Management has been able to keep the number of shares tightly under control; with only 15.8 million outstanding for a market capitalization in the area of Cdn$50 million.  Based on this rough valuation, the company is currently selling at a discount of almost two-thirds to its liquidation value!<P>

1996: Management Initiatives<P>

Like Dr. Appel, we believe 1996 holds exceptional promise for Chase.  In the coming year, the company will finish defining the size of the Taysan resource, and drilling programs are currently underway on the company’s other Philippine properties.  Additionally, the Phase II drilling program at the Mejillones copper property in Chile will be concluded in 1996.  Finally, management will concentrate on new acquisitions, such as the exclusive option agreement which was concluded as we went to press.  This agreement, which was bid on jointly by Chase and BHP, allows for the acquisition of another 110,000 hectares of mineral claims in the Philippine provinces of Aurora and Nueva Ecija; this is an extremely high profile project.<P>

There is much more news to communicate.  To that end, the London Taylor Group has been retained to provide investor relations services.  They have prepared a comprehensive Corporate Profile available to you by calling 1-800-380-3143, or faxing 1-619-431-5138.  If you wish, you may have your name added to a list to promptly receive news on Chase as it unfolds in the weeks and months ahead.<P>

 We look forward to being in touch again soon.  Thank you for you continued interest.<P>


On Behalf of Management,</blockquote><P>

<b>Third Quarter 1995 Report to Stockholders - November 1995</b>
<p>
In the third quarter of fiscal 1995 your Company's new management team was faced with many challenges and responded by continuing to undertake strategic initiatives in an effort to pave the way for future growth and profitability.  We are also continuing to implement specific programs designed to improve sales, reduce restaurant operating costs and general and administrative expenses.  Although there can be no assurance that these programs will be successful in returning the Company to profitability, we believe that we are headed in the right direction, and positioned to show meaningful  improvement in our 1996 results.
<p>
Revenues for the third quarter ended September 11, 1995 were $44.3 million, down 15% from $52.2 million generated in the third quarter of 1994.  Restaurant sales were $42.1 million in the 1995 third quarter compared to $47.4 million in last year's third quarter, an 11% decrease.  System-wide sales, which include sales of all Company-operated and franchised restaurants, increased 4% to $93.6 million.  The decrease in restaurant sales for the quarter is primarily attributable to increased sales pressure  from  competitor  discounting.   Additionally,  the lower sales results reflect 11 fewer Company-operated restaurants and the temporary closing of 147 restaurants throughout the Florida, Atlanta and Mobile markets due to severe weather.  The Company incurred a loss for the 1995 third quarter of $7.3 million, or $.14 per share, as compared to a profit of $387 thousand, or $.01 per share, for the comparable period in 1994.  The 1995 third quarter loss reflects $8.8 million in pre-tax accounting charges and loss provisions, which resulted in a loss of $.11 per share.  The net loss before the accounting charges and loss provisions was $1.7 million, or $.03 per share.  The 1995 third quarter accounting charges and loss provisions include a provision for restaurant relocations and abandoned site costs to expense site improvements, settle leases, and provide for other costs associated with the abandonment of underperforming restaurant sites and to provide for the closure of four additional restaurants; additional reserves for future worker's compensation claims exposure in connection with the Company's self-insured plan; a write-off of uncollectible receivables and previously capitalized costs and assets which are not expected to provide future benefit; additional costs associated with staffing changes and redeployment; a write-off of loan origination fees incurred in connection with the Company's credit facility, which has been substantially renegotiated; a charge to dispose of a subsidiary; a reserve for the settlement of litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and to accrue for legal fees; and a reserve for state income tax assessments.
<p>
Although the third quarter was not a profitable one for your Company, we are very encouraged by the double-digit increases in sales at the locations offering our L.A. MEX products.  In fact, due to strong preliminary results at six existing co-branded Checkers' restaurants, we will be expanding our test roll-out to include approximately 50 Company-operated and franchised restaurants in the Tampa/St. Petersburg/Sarasota, Florida markets by the end of January 1996.  Further expansion of the L.A. MEX concept into other markets will depend upon the results of our test roll-out in the Tampa Bay area. Four Company-operated restaurants and twenty-six franchised restaurants opened during the first three quarters of 1995.  By the end of the year, the Company plans to open an additional four or five restaurants (two in South Florida and two or three in New Jersey).  Franchisees are expected to open an additional 9 to 24 restaurants.   As of October 26, 1995, there were 242 Company-operated restaurants and 252 franchised restaurants for a total of 494 restaurants in twenty-three states and the District of Columbia.
<p>
As an additional step toward achieving improved operating efficiency, two key management roles were filled during the quarter.  C. Dawn Voss was promoted to Vice-President, Operation Services and will be responsible for all restaurant services including purchasing, distribution, equipment R&D, and field communications.  Ms. Voss has more than 19 years of restaurant operations experience.  Also during the quarter, Howard Berkowitz was appointed Vice-President, Manufacturing, Franchise Sales and Development.  Mr. Berkowitz has more than thirty years experience in food service and general management.
<p>
We would like to thank all of our shareholders, franchisees and employees for their dedication and support through these difficult times.  We look forward to sharing more promising news with you in the future.

<P>

	Cheyenne is pleased to report sales and earnings results for the third quarter ended March 31, 1996  (FQ396).  Revenues increased 24% to $44,014,000 from $35,636,000 in the third quarter of 1995, with net income of $5,313,000 or 14 cents per share versus $7,975,000 or 20 cents per share for the comparable 1995 period.  Included in last year’s comparable quarter were charges of approximately $704,000, or about one cent per share, net of income taxes, associated with the write-off of purchased R&D related to the JETserve product acquisition. For the nine months ended March 31, 1996, revenues increased 44% to $124,927,000 from $86,899,000 in
the comparable 1995 period.  Net income for the nine months was $19,822,000 or 51 cents per share versus $29,526,000 or 74 cents per share one year ago.  Excluding one-time factors, earnings per share for the nine months were 58 cents versus 48 cents last year.
<P>

	Cheyenne’s December 1995 release of ARCserve Version 6, the next generation of its leading Novell network back-up solution, has been well received by the market.  Localized versions of this product in German and French were released in FQ396.  ARCserve Version 6 now makes up approximately 70% of Cheyenne’s ARCserve for NetWare business.  Sales of upgrades from prior versions to this new product are expected to generate incremental revenues in FQ496 and through fiscal year 1997.    Based on the strength of upgrade sales, the rapid acceptance of ARCserve Version 6 and April sell-through figures, Cheyenne expects point of sale revenues to increase strongly in FQ496 compared to FQ396.
<P>

	The Company continues to expand its presence in the Windows NT and Desktop area and is looking forward to major product announcements in these areas by the end of fiscal year 1996. In FQ396, revenues for Cheyenne’s Windows NT product line increased to approximately $8,300,000 from approximately $5,000,000 in FQ296, a 66% sequential quarterly increase. 
<P>
 
	In FQ396, Cheyenne achieved strong sales growth in Major Accounts in North America and is placing an increased focus on such sales.  The Company’s  business in Japan also continued to expand rapidly in FQ396.   With localization and other initiatives underway, the Company expects to continue to realize increased contribution from international markets.
<P>

	The Company continues to believe that it is well positioned to benefit in the long term from the growth of the overall market for network storage management software products and the growth of the Windows NT market.  The Company expects to maintain its leadership position in the NetWare back-up market by its successful introduction of ARCserve 6.  Cheyenne also expects continued strong growth from ARCserve for NT, Windows and its anti-virus product, InocuLAN for Windows NT, as these products further penetrate this rapidly growing market.  Cheyenne also continues to invest and make progress in the market for UNIX storage management back-up products.
<P>

	Cheyenne remains confident in the long-term health of its business and we look forward to reporting our continued progress to you.
<P>

	We sincerely appreciate your support and confidence.

<P>

Sincerely,

<blockquote>
<B>Dear Fellow Shareholders:</B>

<P>

I am pleased to report a 40% increase in earnings for the third quarter of 1996 over the 1995 third quarter, particularly given that our comparable store sales were essentially flat for the quarter.  To address the essentially flat sales we are increasing our prospect mailings in an attempt to increase the traffic coming into our stores.

<P>

We are very pleased with the sales results of our new stores (see the list below) and our newly remodeled stores.  As a result we intend to step up our remodeling efforts in 1997 so that more of our older stores can benefit from this new look.  Also, during the third quarter of this year we were able to fully convert our stores from a principally folded environment to a principally hanging environment.  We believe this will make selling smoother and easier for the customer.

<P>

Our balance sheet is strong with over $3 million in cash, our gross margins were over 60% for the second straight quarter and we have completed our store refixturing program, thus we look forward with expectation to an improved 4th quarter.</blockquote><P>

<P>

San Jose, CA, October 15, 1996 -- Chips and Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHPS) today reported revenues of $44.5 Million and net income of $9.5 Million, or $0.42 per share, for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Chips and Technologies, Inc. is a leading supplier of highly integrated semiconductor and software solutions which provide graphics, video and other capabilities to portable and desktop computers.

<P>

"Our earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 surged 110% over the 20 cents posted in last year’s first quarter and were up 56% over the 27 cents posted in the prior quarter," stated Jim Stafford, Chips’ President and CEO.  "Similarly, revenues increased 20% over last year’s first quarter and 15% over the prior quarter.

<P>

"During the first quarter, demand remained strong from the worldwide notebook computer market for our leadership graphics accelerators,"  Mr. Stafford said.  "We are pleased that the quarter was also characterized by strong gross margin improvement to 48%, from 39% last year and 44% the prior quarter.

<P>

"Chips and Technologies is strongly committed to sustaining our leadership position on the cutting edge of new technologies," Mr. Stafford said.  "Our technology partnership with Lockheed Martin’s Real3D® organization, the leader in real-time 3D technology, is proceeding productively.  This partnership, created to provide 2D/3D technology to Intel Corp. next summer, positions us to maintain our leadership position in the portable market.  It also opens up significant new opportunities in the desktop PC and emerging Internet markets.

<P>

"Our HiQVideoTM family of video/graphics accelerators was featured in Toshiba’s new SatelliteProTM and TecraTM lines of notebook computers and we reaped additional significant design wins for this new generation of 64-bit products during the quarter.

<P>

Zoomed Video technology pioneered by Chips continues to gain ground since its adoption by the Zoomed Video Initiative earlier this year," Mr. Stafford noted.  As the standard for video capture and display for portable computers, Zoomed Video facilitates applications such as video capture, MPEG playback, TV tuners and video conferencing with multiple video streams, without adding cost to the notebook PC.  Products from ZVI members are designed to be compatible with the Company’s HiQVideo video/graphics accelerators.

<P>

Most recently, the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA), endorsed PanelLinkTM technology, a licensed technology from Silicon Image Inc., as the proposed interface standard for flat panel displays in portable PCs and on the desktop.  "Our new two-chip PanelLink solution began shipping this current quarter," Mr. Stafford added.  "We plan to integrate PanelLink transmitter technology into our HiQVideo family of products."

<P>

For the first fiscal quarter of 1997, operating expenses increased to $11.4 million, an increase of 16% over the year-ago period.  As a percent of sales, operating expenses were 26%, compared to 26% in the quarter ended a year ago and compared to 29% in the quarter ended June 30, 1996.

To Cinergy Corp. shareholders:
<p>	So far in 1995, at least four mergers of major electric utilities have been announced, involving billions of dollars of assets and customers in more than ten states. These announcements demonstrate that the industry is following the pattern for strategic partnerships established by Cinergy as a means of preparing for competition.
<p>	At Cinergy, we intend to demonstrate that we  can harvest the benefits of our merger. Our ability to surpass merger savings targets in our first full year of operations has helped us achieve third-quarter earnings growth of 89% over the same period in 1994.
<p>	On October 19, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 43 cents per share on the outstanding shares of common stock, payable November 15, 1995, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 30, 1995.

<p>	<blockquote>Cinergy Corp. earnings for the third quarter of 1995 were $.69 per share, compared with $.40 per share in the third quarter of 1994.  For the quarter, operating income was up 43% and net income up 89% over the same period in 1994.  
<p>	Continued emphasis on cost reductions and achieving merger savings, combined with warmer than normal summer weather and rate relief received earlier this year by PSI Energy, contributed to the increases.
<p>	Total electricity sales (kwh) were up 11.7% for the quarter, reflecting the warm summer weather and the strong regional economy.  Gas sales and transportation volumes (mcf) increased 2.7% when compared to the same period in 1994.

<p>	<blockquote>For the 12 months ended September 30, 1995, earnings were $1.62 per share, which reflects write-offs totaling $.30 per share.  Write-offs were primarily for merger-related costs, such as transaction costs, and other costs that cannot be recovered from customers under the merger savings mechanisms authorized by regulators.  Earnings for the 12 months ended September 30, 1994, were $.36 per share after write-offs of $.09 per share for merger-related costs and $1.52 for certain disallowed costs of the Zimmer Generating Station.

<h3>PSI Energy Retail Rate Case Request</h3>
	Hearings have been held before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) on PSI Energy's case-in-chief supporting the company's request for a $116 million, 11.5% retail rate increase.  The company’s proposal includes a rate of return of 8.75%, and return on equity of 12.5% with an opportunity to earn up to 13.5%, on total company rate base of  $2.6 billion. PSI is seeking to recover the costs of the Wabash River Repowering Project, demand side management programs, the Gibson Generating Station Unit 4 Scrubber, and other utility plant investments, which have been previously approved by regulators.  Intervenors filed their case-in-chief on November 1 recommending an increase of $37 million. A final order is expected by the second quarter of 1996. 
<p>

<h3>CG&E Planned Gas Rate Request</h3>
	On July 17, 1995, CG&E asked the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to establish a pre-filing settlement process to discuss the company’s need for an increase in gas rates that would go into effect in late 1996.  CG&E is currently analyzing financial data, but expects the requested increase to be approximately  $25-30 million in annual revenues.  While CG&E has been effective in controlling its gas operations expenses, an increase is needed to cover additional capital investment necessitated by  service area growth. 
<p>	This will be CG&E’s first rate request since the implementation of federal rules deregulating the gas industry in late 1993, and it is hoped the discussions will provide input from customers on restructuring and redesigning gas rates and tariffs. This effort is aimed at enhancing customers’ ability to choose their natural gas supplier and offering customers the opportunity to select from a variety of unbundled services.
<p>

<h3>PUCO Approves CG&E’s Real Time Pricing Proposal</h3>
	In October, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) approved CG&E’s Real Time Pricing (RTP) proposal. RTP is an innovative rate option that prices electricity based on the CG&E’s marginal cost of providing it each hour. CG&E plans to pilot this new pricing service to as many as 50 large customers through December 1998 before offering it to a broader range of customers.
<p>	Each day, the tariff provides 24 hourly prices to a customer for purchases the following day. Based on those prices, customers may decide to operate differently to save on electric bills. RTP is an attractive option for customers with large power needs and the ability to shift usage. CG&E’s RTP program is designed to enhance customer loyalty as customers have more energy options. At the same time, shifting power needs to times of lower demand, CG&E can operate its electrical system more efficiently.  In addition, lower peaks will allow CG&E to defer adding costly new generating capacity.
<p>

<h3>Cinergy’s Reengineering Effort</h3>
	In October, Cinergy began the second phase of a reengineering project called Transformation Now. During Phase 1, which began in April, over 1,000 people participated in workshops and meetings to identify opportunities for reengineering efforts. The participants identified more than 50 opportunities which could yield $515 million in net savings in the next five years, over and above the $1.5 billion already identified in the merger integration process.
<p>	In Phase II 135 people are assigned to process teams to analyze and test the concepts identified in Phase I.  If the concepts continue to prove valuable, the teams will begin the redesign of work processes to the indentified savings.  Union employees selected by union leadership are actively participating in the reengineering effort.	
<p>	The reengineering initiative is overseen by a Steering Committee consisting of five senior officers, including the Chief Operating Officer.  In addition, realizing that employee participation is a critical element in a successful reengineering effort, an Employee Representative Team was formed whose membership includes the leadership of all five Cinergy union organizations. Consulting support is being provided by CSC Index, the firm of James Champy, one of the founders of the reengineering concept.

<CENTER><B>Third Quarter Fiscal Year 1996 Results</B></CENTER>
<P>
Net revenues for the fiscal third quarter, ended June 30, 1996, increased 83% to $7.1 million versus $3.9 million for the same period last year.  The company realized net earnings of $896,000 or 20 cents per share compared to $35,000 or one cent per share for the prior year period.

<P>

Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 were up 87% to $19.9 million as compared to $10.7 million in 1995.  Net earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 increased to $2.5 million or 63 cents per share, compared to $8,000 or less than one cent per share in the year earlier period.

<P>

We are excited to have just completed a record-setting quarter.  This has been accomplished by continuing to focus on our identified markets with disk array products that bring differentiated value to our customers within our target markets.

<P>

The film/video market continues to be our strongest, rewarding us for our early focus on these applications, long before other disk array suppliers recognized the opportunity. Today, this market is close to 40% of our revenues, with Avid Technology being our largest customer. A list of our other customers reads like a Who's Who in film and video production, including Warner Bros., Kodak, Industrial Light and Magic, Dreamworks and many others.

<P>

Progress is being made in our other markets as well.  Second in revenues is the digital broadcast market, contributing about 20% of our revenues to date.  We are also excited by the acceptance of our disk arrays in the satellite imaging and medical imaging markets. We have devoted marketing, sales and application engineering resources to these two markets, and although these are not currently in our top two revenue-generating markets, it's clear the effort  has been well spent.  These markets are growing as we sign key customers whom we feel will be key contributors in the upcoming quarters.

<P>

By  staying close to our customers we develop the storage products they need today and in the future.  One of those products is the Series 7000 Fibre Channel disk array which we introduced  at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) show in April.  The response to this disk array has exceeded our expectations, and we already have orders in house for delivery this fall.

<P>

At the recent Siggraph trade show, which is a large graphic imaging show, we introduced the Series 6500 disk array.  The 6500 disk array is an entry-level disk array providing the performance level our customers have come to expect from Ciprico, but at a lower price.  This disk array will take us into new application areas in markets previously untapped and provides us with an excellent entry point to the rapidly growing Windows NT platform.  We are already working with a number of new partners in this platform and are very excited about the opportunity.

<P>

Our product acceptance and revenue growth has come from around the world, with about 40% of our revenues being international.  To continue this growth, we are investing in engineering resources and application expertise on a world wide basis.  Ciprico's employees are focused on serving our present customers and expanding our customer base by being the best disk array provider in our markets.  At the same time, we are continuing our leadership in product innovation, so we can be the first to market with the best solution available.  It is through this concentration of world wide resources that we will keep our momentum growing.

<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<B>December 12, 1996

<P>

Dear Shareholder:</B>

<CENTER><B>We report the following results for the second<BR>
 quarter ended October 31, 1996.<P></B>

<a name="table1"></a>
<img align=bottom src="CSYIFIN1.GIF" alt="financial statement"><p></CENTER>

Sales for the quarter increased slightly compared to last year.  For the six months ended October 31, 1996, however, sales are still 6.4% below last years sales of $34,983,000 for the same period.

<P>
	
Net Earnings for the quarter, $320,000 and $0.06 per share, are significantly lower compared to $1,104,000 and $0.20 per share, for the same quarter last year.  Similarly, for the first six months of fiscal 1997, earnings declined to $544,000 and $0.10 per share, compared to $2,050,000 and $0.38 per share for the same period last year.  The decline in earnings is attributed to, among others, an unfavorable product mix, very competitive pricing, expenses related to realignment and expansion of facilities, reduction in rental income, and expenses related to consulting services.  Despite all these increased costs, we note that the company has extended its string of consecutive operationally profitable quarters to thirty-nine.  Backlog at the end of the quarter is relatively steady at approximately $14 million.

<P>

The company recently began using its fourth manufacturing location after converting that warehouse facility to a production facility.  This will help the company realign and expand its manufacturing capabilities.  We expect the facility to be completed by the end of the current fiscal year.

<P>

In conclusion, on behalf of the employees, management, and the Board of Directors, I extend to all of you Season’s Greetings and Best Wishes for a Prosperous New Year.


<P>
Sincerely,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 1997 RESULTS</B>

<P>

Net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1997, ended September 28, 1996, were $236.0 million, a decline from $317.8 million for the corresponding quarter a year ago, but an increase of approximately 10 percent from $214.9 million for last quarter.   Net income for the quarter was $2.99 million, compared to net income of $33.0 million for the year-ago quarter, and net loss of $7.6 million for the preceding quarter.  Per share earnings were $0.05 for the quarter, compared with earnings of $0.47 per share for the year-ago quarter, and loss of $0.12 per share for the prior quarter. 
<P>

Fiscal Q2 results reflect improvements in both revenues and bottom line performance when compared with fiscal Q1.
<P>

During the quarter Cirrus Logic expanded its product offerings in multimedia, mass storage and communications with several new product introductions.  The new Laguna 3DÔ graphics and CrystalClearÔ 3D audio components can provide the technology for a new generation of 3D multimedia PCs.  The Company introduced new optical storage controllers for recordable CD-ROMs ("CD-Rs") with read speeds up to 18x, and record speeds up to 8x.  Cirrus Logic’s FastPathÔ modem chips, introduced in June, shipped nearly a quarter of a million units in the quarter. 
<P>

During the quarter Cirrus Logic announced a system-on-a-chip solution for Internet appliances and hand-held computing and communications devices.  The PS7110 is Cirrus Logic’s first entree into the emerging system-on-a-chip market, and incorporates its own imbedded RISC-based microprocessor, as well as graphics and communications functions.  The Company also introduced what it believes is the industry’s first single-chip  "surround-sound"  Codec for Dolby  AC-3 and Dolby Pro 
<P>
Logic applications in home entertainment systems.  These new products are a part of Cirrus Logic’s multi-year initiative to offer products for applications beyond the PC. 
<P>

During the quarter Cirrus Logic completed the formation of Cirent Semiconductor, a manufacturing joint venture with Lucent Technologies.  As the Company’s second major manufacturing joint venture, Cirent Semiconductor complements the MiCRUS joint venture with IBM in the Company’s expanding manufacturing infrastructure.   Cirrus Logic also completed the sale of the assets of its PicoPower core logic and flash memory controller product lines, which contributed to this quarter’s results. 
<P>

Cirrus Logic is a leading manufacturer of advanced integrated circuits for the desktop and portable computing, telecommunications, and consumer electronics markets.  The Company applies its system-level expertise in analog and digital design to innovate highly integrated, software-rich solutions.  Cirrus Logic has developed a broad portfolio of products and technologies for applications spanning multimedia, communications, mass storage, and data acquisition. 
<P>

Any forward looking statements contained in this document reflect management’s current intentions and expectations.  Actual future results could vary materially depending on certain risks and uncertainties, including factors such as successful execution of production ramps on new graphics, audio, read-channel and modem products, timely completion of lease financing for manufacturing capital equipment for the Company’s joint ventures, the development of new markets for Internet appliances and hand-held computing and communications devices, actual operational spending, and the risk factors listed in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March of 1996, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September of 1996.

<BLOCKQUOTE>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
<P>
																
																
     Record sales in the second quarter and for the first half																
of the year produced record earnings per share for the 																
Company.																
<P>

     Sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 were																
$166,715,051, a 30% increase over the $128,192,670																
reported for the second quarter of 1995.  Sales for the six  																
months ended June 30, 1996 were $315,355,074, a 21% 																
increase over 1995's six months sales of $259,963,049.  																
Both sales figures were records, and second quarter sales  																
were a record for any quarter in the Company's history.																
    
<P>
 Net income in the second quarter was $8,685,723, a 106% increase when compared with the $4,212,086 earned in 1995's second																
quarter.  Earnings per share for the quarter were $.58 compared with last year's 28 cents.  Net income for the six months was 																
$14,936,679, a 101% increase from the $7,415,550 earned in the first six months of 1995.  Earnings per share for the six months were																
$1.00 compared to $.50 earned in the first six months of 1995.																
    
<P>
 The recreational vehicle group had a 31% sales gain in the quarter.  This gain was fueled by market share gains and an improving																
recreational vehicle market as evidenced by the April and May sales gains of approximately 6% reported by the Recreational																
Vehicle Industry Association.																
    
<P>
 The modular housing group had a second quarter sales increase of 34% as the volume from the recently added North Carolina and																
Tennessee plants continued to increase.  Sales at North Carolina have outgrown the existing capacity and construction of a new 																
facility began during the second quarter so we can meet the demand for All American's homes.																
   
<P>
  The parts and supply group, which represents 5% of sales, had a 12% sales increase.  This group, which is largely a supplier of																
parts to the van conversion business, should benefit from the new General Motors van that is becoming available in greater numbers																
to industry converters.																
    
<P>
 During the second quarter, the Annual Meeting of Shareholders was held and 87% of the outstanding shares were represented in																
person or by proxy.  All incumbent directors were reelected at the meeting.																
   
<P>
  As we reflect on the record performances reported to you in this message, we want you to know that the Company still has much																
opportunity to grow.  Your Board of Directors also feels positive about the Company's future and therefore approved a two-for-one																
stock split at its regular quarterly meeting on July 17, 1996.  The split will be effective August 28, 1996 to shareholders of record on																
August 7 and is reflected in the per share earnings mentioned above.																
    
<P>
 We appreciate your continued support and loyalty.

     1996 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>



	For the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, the company reported net income of $410,000, or $0.07 per share, compared to net income of $104,000, or $0.02 per share for the third quarter of 1995.  Sales for the current quarter were $25,388,000, up 3.6 percent from $24,513,000 in last year's third quarter.  Gross margin in the third quarter of 1996 decreased to 18.6 percent from 20.3 percent in the year-ago  period.    Continued  cost reduction  measures resulted in a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense to 15.3 percent  of  sales  in  the  quarter,  from  17.5 percent in the third quarter of 1995.  Operating margin increased from 2.7 percent in the year-ago quarter to 3.4 percent.
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, the company reported net income of $111,000, or $0.02 per share, compared with a net loss of $395,000, or $0.06 per share, for the same period a year earlier.  Sales for the first nine months of 1996 were $66,055,000, compared to $66,600,000 for the first nine months of 1995.  Gross margin for the first nine months of 1996 was 18.2 percent, compared to 19.6 percent for the same period a year ago.  Selling, general and administrative expense was 16.5 percent of sales for the first nine months of 1996, down from 18.3 percent for the first nine months of 1995.  Operating margin increased to 1.6 percent from  1.3 percent in the same period last year.
<P>

	Reductions in operating costs have played a major role in helping the company achieve profitability.  The company had an objective for 1996 to identify cost-reduction opportunities that would result in approximately $1.5 million of savings in 1996.   Operating costs are approximately $1.3 million lower through the first nine months, which leaves the company well-positioned to achieve this goal.
	Almost half of the 1.7 percentage-point drop in the gross margin in the quarter was due to increased air freight expenses to import the company's  popular Intenna® cordless phones and answering systems.  The popularity of the company's Intenna products has resulted in customers placing orders for more product than they had originally forecasted.  In order to take advantage of this opportunity, the company had to use more air freight to ensure timely availability.  Normally, much less expensive ocean freight is used to import products when time is not a priority.
<P>

	Domestic CB radio sales were up approximately 8 percent during the third quarter, and the company continues to build the distribution network to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the previously-announced agreement with General Motors.  There are ten distributors lined up to sell Cobra CB radios with the General Motors "Mark of Excellence," Chevrolet "Bow-Tie" and GMC trademarks to over 8,000 General Motors and Chevrolet dealers nationwide.  Just recently, the company  received its first orders from two of its newest GM distributors, T.E. Hunt Auto Radio Service Center, Inc. and Specmo Enterprises, Inc., both located in Michigan.
	
<P>
The company also announced that 50 police, fire and emergency medical vehicles in Dayton, Ohio will be outfitted with Safety Alert™ transmitters.  This signals growing acceptance of the Safety Alert technology in larger metropolitan areas.  In addition to these efforts, the company continues to pursue placement opportunities on locomotives, railroad crossing gates, school buses and so-called amber vehicles.

<P>
<B>Coming in the first quarter of 1997...  </B><P>

World's Smallest Full-Featured Hand-Held CB Radio.   The HH-45WX,  stands at only 5 and  1/4 inches, but is a full power,  40 channel hand held Citizens Band radio with 10 National Weather Service channels.  It's the only CB on the market small enough to fit into a shirt pocket that can still offer maximum range capability and has features usually found only in much larger CBs.

<BLOCKQUOTE>  <CENTER><B>1996 THIRD QUARTER</B></CENTER>
<P>
We are pleased to send you our first quarterly report as a company trading on Nasdaq (Symbol: MOKA). To our new shareholders who purchased on the initial public offering in September, we welcome you to Coffee People. And to our longer term shareholders who invested in the company earlier, we appreciate your ongoing support.

<P>
<CENTER><B>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING SUPPORTS GROWTH PLAN</B></CENTER>
<P>
Our big news for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 is the completion of our initial public offering of common stock. In that offering, the company sold 1,225,000 shares and certain selling stockholders offered an additional 325,000 shares. The offering, which generated approximately $10 million in proceeds to the company, gives us the financial strength to move ahead with our growth plan. The company’s growth strategy centers on opening a total of 30 new stores before the end of 1997 with an additional 50 targeted for 1998. There are factors outside the company’s control, however, that could affect our ability to meet these projections.
<P>
<CENTER><B>REVENUE UP, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH LOWERS NET INCOME</B></CENTER>
<P>
Revenues in the third quarter were $3.1 million, up 4 percent from the same 1995 quarter. The increase in retail sales was attributable to the opening of one new store since the same 1995 quarter. Same-store sales, impacted by decreases at two stores, were down 1.8 percent in the three months. Of the 18 stores open for the full third quarters of 1996 and 1995, sales at one were 21 percent lower and another one decreased 17 percent. The first store is located in a shopping center in the process of redevelopment which makes customer access difficult. The second store, which the company expects to close when the lease expires in April 1997, is in close proximity to one of our top producing locations.
<P>
Costs associated with our plan to grow the business lowered net income in the quarter to $47,000 from $63,000 a year ago. Net income was affected by higher general and administrative expenses, most of which were tied to strengthening the management team in preparation for rapid expansion of the company. Earnings per share for the quarter were $.02 compared to $.04 due in part to a 42 percent increase in the number of shares due primarily to a private placement of common stock in January 1996.
<P>
<CENTER><B>STORE CONTRIBUTION NEARLY 19 PERCENT</B></CENTER>
<P>
We continue to be pleased with our average store sales from the 12 neighborhood and drive through stores open for the full quarter. Average sales from these stores were $186,000 for the quarter. The average store contribution margin for these same 12 stores was 18.7 percent, down from 19.5 percent realized in last year’s third quarter. The slight decline in store contribution margin was due to higher costs for milk, chocolate and pastry. In September, we raised prices on our coffee beverages to regain some of the margin erosion.
<P>
<CENTER><B>THREE NEW STORES OPENED</B></CENTER>
<P>
With our initial public offering completed, we have turned our attention to expanding our store base. In late October, we opened a new store in Tigard, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. Two locations began operating in the Denver, Colorado area in mid-November as our first venture outside of Oregon. Currently, we have 22 outlets including coffee houses, drive through Motor Mokas® and airport Aero Moka™ kiosks. Potential sites for future location of Coffee People stores now under study include Southern California, Chicago, Dallas/Houston and San Francisco.
<P>
BUILDING ON A SOLID FOUNDATION
<P>
The past year has been spent preparing for the expansion of Coffee People which is now underway. We are confident that our store format, extensive menu, quality products and customer service will win the hearts and patronage of coffee drinkers in new markets. Our growth, however, will come at a cost as we incur higher expenses related to opening new stores, marketing and training new employees. We sincerely appreciate the support and loyalty of our customers, employees and shareholders as we pursue the opportunities ahead.

<CENTER><B>COLONIAL DATA TECHNOLOGIES CORP. REPORTS REVENUES AND EARNINGS FOR SECOND QUARTER 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

	New Milford, CT, August 7, 1996 -- Colonial Data Technologies Corp. ("CDT") (Nasdaq:CDTX) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996.
<P>

	For the quarter ended June 30, 1996, revenues were $18,694,000, an increase of 2% as compared to $18,308,000 for the same period last year.  Net income for the quarter decreased 31% to $1,955,000 compared with $2,825,000 a year earlier.  Net income per share for the quarter was $0.13, compared with $0.21 for the same period in 1995, on increased outstanding shares.  The weighted average common shares outstanding were 15,593,227 and 13,757,353 for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 and 1995, respectively.  For the three months ended June 30, 1996, gross profit and operating margins were 32% and 14%, respectively, compared with 41% and 25% for the same period last year.
<P>

	Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1996 were $37,608,000, an increase of 12% compared to $33,514,000 for the same period in 1995.  Six month net income for 1996 was $4,706,000 or $0.30 per share, compared with $5,239,000 or $0.38 per share for the same period in 1995.  Weighted average common shares were 15,605,588 and 13,719,494 for the six months ended June 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
<P>

	The Company attributed the decrease in earnings primarily to lower lease-related gross profit and an increase in operating expenses.  Robert J. Schock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "The Company remains focused on providing end-to-end solutions to our primary customers, the regional Bell and other telephone operating companies."  Mr. Schock added, "The Company’s recently announced agreement to merge with US Order, Inc., the closing of which is subject to certain conditions, provides an excellent platform from which to expand our current product lines, providing a high-end smart telephone, recurring revenue from information services, and expertise in the electronic commerce arena, which with the advent of smart cards, will cross over into our information appliance market.  In addition, US Order’s Intelifone, which has been well received in the retail market, will provide us a full line of information appliances to offer to retailers, including Caller ID adjunct units, feature phones, cordless Caller ID phones, smart phones, and home office and small business systems.  We look forward to packaging US Order’s information services with our information appliance line and building a satisfied subscriber base."
<P>

	Colonial Data Technologies Corp. designs, develops and markets telecommunications products that support intelligent network services being developed and implemented by the regional Bell operating companies and other telephone operating companies.  In recent years, the Company has concentrated its product development and marketing efforts on products that support Caller ID and other emerging intelligent network services.  Colonial Data Technologies Corp. and US Order, Inc. have developed a smart telephone, the Telesmart 4000/Intelifone 2000, which provides consumers call management features and major new advances in interactive applications via telephone.  In addition, the Company currently offers a line of Caller ID adjunct units and telephones with integrated Caller ID, small business telecommunications systems with the Landmark® trademark and high-end consumer telecommunications equipment.  The Company also repairs and refurbishes telecommunications products for commercial customers and provides services that support the development and implementation of intelligent network services.

	<I>"Safe Harbor" statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the impact of competitive products and pricing, product demand and market acceptance, new product development, reliance on key strategic alliances, availability of raw materials, the telecommunications regulatory environment, fluctuations in operating results and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

 Double Digit Revenue and Operating Cash Flow Growth for Seventh Consecutive Quarter</B></CENTER>
<P>




<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>By RALPH  J. ROBERTS, CHAIRMAN<BR>
 and BRIAN  L. ROBERTS, PRESIDENT</FONT></CENTER>

<P>

Comcast Corporation reported results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1996.   Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 1996 were $974.6 million, representing a 12.0% increase over the $870.2 million reported for the same period in 1995. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 1996 was $295.8 million, an increase of 12.0% over the $264.1 million reported in the third quarter of 1995.  These results continue a seven quarter trend of double digit revenue and operating cash flow growth.
<P>

In the third quarter, each of the Company’s core business lines  experienced strong growth. The cable division reported both revenue and operating cash flow growth of 6.6% over the prior year period.  The cellular division continued its positive operating trend, with revenues and operating cash flow increasing 12.5% and 19.5%, respectively, over the prior year period.  QVC continued its impressive performance, with revenue and operating cash flow growth of 10.1% and 16.0%, respectively, over the prior year period, despite strong competition for viewers as a result of the Summer Olympics.
<P>

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, the Company reported revenues of $2.871 billion and operating cash flow of $862.0 million as compared to revenues and operating cash flow of $2.357 billion and $744.6 million, respectively, for the same period in 1995.  Consolidated results for the Company do not include the results of QVC prior to the acquisition date of February 1995.  On a pro forma basis, as if QVC had been owned for the entire nine month period ended September 30, 1995, the Company's consolidated revenues and operating cash flow for the period ended September 30, 1996 increased 15.4% and 12.3%, respectively, over the same period in 1995.
<P>
<IMG SRC="CMCS.gif" align=right>
Comcast continues to be enthusiastic about the prospects for each of its core businesses.  In particular, the cable division is continuing to aggressively upgrade its network infrastructure and customer service platforms to provide a broader  and richer array of programming.  The capacity of upgraded networks will also provide unique opportunities to market new products and services.  By the end of 1996, 50% of homes passed in Comcast’s markets will have upgraded state-of-the-art networks.  This number will grow to 70% of homes passed by the end of 1997.

<P>
<CENTER><I><B>Opening of Comcast <BR>

<P>



The Company recently opened its first Comcast Communications Center in suburban Philadelphia, a retail environment that showcases the Company as an integrated provider of communications and entertainment services, selling and promoting all of the products available to its customers in that core market.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=-1> Comcast Corporation is principally engaged in the development, management and operation of wired telecommunications including cable television and telephone services; wireless telecommunications including cellular, personal communications services and direct to home satellite television; and content through principal ownership and management of QVC, the world's premier electronic retailer, and through majority ownership of Comcast-Spectacor and other programming investments.

<blockquote><U><B>COMDISCO, INC. ANNOUNCES RECORD 1996 NET EARNINGS OF $2.00 PER COMMON SHARE ON REVENUE OF $2.4 BILLION; DECLARES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS</B></U>

<P>

Rosemont, Illinois...November 6, 1996...Comdisco, Inc. today reported operating results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 1996.

<P>

<B>OPERATING RESULTS:</B><BR>
For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the Company reported total revenue of $728 million, versus $584 million for the prior year period.  Net earnings for the quarter were $28 million, or $.53 per common share, versus $25 million, or $.45 per common share, for the prior year period.

<P>

For the year ended September 30, 1996, the Company reported total revenue of $2.4 billion, versus $2.2 billion for the prior year period.  Net earnings were $106 million, or $2.00 per common share, versus $96 million, or $1.73 per common share, for the prior year period.

<P>

<B>CEO COMMENTARY:</B><BR>
Commenting on the Company’s results, Jack Slevin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated," 1996 was the best year in the Company’s history. We set many new records during the year but most notable was the volume of new business that we wrote during the year.  We surpassed our internal target by over $400 million and wrote $2.6 billion of new business.  A significant part of this increase was due to the performance of our Technology Integration Services and Distributed Systems Groups.   

<P>

Our 1996 fourth quarter was our best quarter ever.  The Company’s new business volume, revenue, and earnings were all records.  Comdisco’s Business Continuity and Network Services division as well as our Healthcare subsidiary and Comdisco Ventures division posted records for both earnings and revenue for the quarter.  The Company’s lease volume surpassed the $700 million mark for the second consecutive quarter to a record $769 million.  

<P>

During the quarter we formed an alliance with VIASOFT (VIAS/NASDAQ/NM) which will add value to our Millennium Testing Services program. We also formed an alliance with Asset Software International Corporation of Canada to cooperatively provide asset management software and services worldwide.  These joint ventures are integral components of Comdisco’s technology services offerings.

<P>

For the year, we established records in terms of new business volume, revenue, and earnings.  One of our value drivers, operating lease revenue, was up 22% from the prior year period.  The pretax earnings contribution from our five diversified business areas; Business Continuity and Network Services, Electronics, International, Healthcare and Comdisco Ventures, was $88 million, or 48% of pretax profits, up 28% from last year.

The Company strengthened its financial position in 1996 and made continued improvements in shareholder value.  We repurchased $80 million, or 3.7 million shares, of Comdisco common stock during the year.  Despite our aggressive share repurchase program we increased our stockholders equity to a record $799 million.  Our financial performance did not go unnoticed.  In April, Standard & Poor’s raised our debt rating to BBB+ and in October Moody’s raised it to Baa1.  Also, the total return of 47% on Comdisco common stock for fiscal 1996 outperformed the S&P 500 Index. 

<P>

We experienced great success in 1996 and we anticipate that with the people, strategies and technology services that we have in place, we should achieve an even greater level of success in 1997. 

<P>

<B>DIVIDEND INFORMATION:</B><BR>
On November 5, 1996, the company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.07 per share to common stockholders.  The common stock cash dividend will be payable on December 9, 1996, to stockholders of record on November 15, 1996.  The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.55 per share to preferred stockholders (Series A and B).  The preferred stock cash dividend will be payable on December 15, 1996 to preferred stockholders of record (Series A and B) on November 29, 1996.  Comdisco had 49,632,758 shares, and 3,562,600 shares of common and preferred (Series A and B) stock outstanding, respectively, at September 30, 1996.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Shareholder or Warrantholder:

<P>

	We are pleased to welcome the new shareholders and warrantholders of Compositech Ltd.  We began trading our Common Stock and Redeemable Common Stock Warrants on The Nasdaq SmallCap MarketSM on July 3, 1996 under the symbols CTEK and CTEKW, respectively.

<P>

	Compositech is at the forefront of the development of superior copper-clad fiberglass epoxy laminates used to make printed circuit boards which are an essential component of personal computers, workstations, data communication, telecommunication equipment, automobile and other transportation equipment and virtually all other electronic equipment.  We believe we can become the leading manufacturer of copper-clad fiberglass epoxy laminates for electronics equipment by effectively exploiting our patented products and processes.

<P>

	We are well-positioned in the electronics industry, which is moving rapidly toward ever thinner, smaller, faster and more complex microprocessors.  This, in turn, is driving demand for more sophisticated printed circuit boards, thus placing increasingly rigorous requirements on the electrical, thermal, chemical and mechanical properties of laminates.  The patented linear laminates developed by Compositech meet these demands efficiently and economically.  Compositech’s innovative laminates replace woven fiberglass cloth reinforced circuit board laminates with a more modern and structurally efficient fiberglass linear core derived from its uniform, orthogonally-layered construction.  This provides significant advantages to customers and enables them to produce more sophisticated circuit boards at a lower cost and with a shorter time to market.

<P>

	Our public offering which raised approximately $9.9 million has enabled us to reduce debt by over $4 million and begin to add the production equipment required to produce products in the quantities necessary to build a substantial revenue base.  The initial effect of the equipment will begin to be felt by year end.

<P>

	With adequate capital and our technology now in place, it is our intention to increase production and marketing.  Our marketing efforts initially targeted to the $1.5 billion multilayer laminate market sector are aimed at the leading-edge producers of circuit boards -- of which there are some 670 such manufacturers in the United States.  However, 18 companies comprise more than one-third of the market and our laminates have been qualified for production by a select group of these key companies.

<P>

	We will continue to keep you informed as to the progress of your company.  Our management team is committed to building a successful and innovative enterprise.  We believe our technology far surpasses any technology now on the market and we look forward to communicating our progress to you on a regular basis.

<P>

	On behalf of our management and employees, we welcome the new shareholders and warrantholders of Compositech Ltd.

<P>


Sincerely,

<a name="letter"><h3>Letter to Shareholders:</h3></a>
<blockquote>February 15, 1996<P>

Dear Shareholder:<P>

I am pleased by the results for the third quarter by our core business.  Comptek Federal Systems (CFS) continued to show improvement over the prior quarter with respect to sales, gross margins and profitability even though we are investing more in research and development and marketing.  However, losses related to ARIA Wireless Systems continued to impact overall net profitability.  Sales for the quarter were up 7% from the prior quarter and up 3.6% from last year's third quarter as a result of improving levels of subcontractor activity on a U.S. Navy contract.  Federal Systems gross margin and operating income continued to increase quarter-to-quarter as a result of more profitable sales mix.  Federal Systems ended the quarter with backlog of $59.5 million..  Cash flow from operations continued to be positive.<P>

For the quarter we recorded a non-cash charge of $7.5 million against our equity investment in ARIA Wireless Systems effectively writing down our investment to zero. The write-down was primarily driven by considerations of past and forecasted losses and negative cash flows.<P>

<B>Federal Systems Operations</B> - On Monday, 29 January, subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the pending acquisition of Advanced Systems Development, Inc. (ASDI).  We anticipate that the merger transaction will be closed in this fourth quarter and that ASDI will be part of Comptek Federal Systems by 1 April 1996, the beginning of our fiscal year 1997.  In its most recent fiscal year ASDI recorded revenues of $14 million.  We expect the acquisition will effect a significant increase in revenues and profitability and will enhance our product line and marketing opportunities.  This acquisition is an important step forward for the Company and we will continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities.<P> 

ASDI is a privately held company located on Long Island which manufactures and markets simulation/stimulation equipment for the world-wide EW community.  Their flagship products,  "AMES II", "Micro-AMES II and "flAMES", are used by many DOD agencies, e.g. weapons systems laboratories at Pt. Mugu, Ca. to test and validate EW software and systems.   These products nicely compliment Comptek's EW product line such as our SLQ-32 training devices and EFE signal processor.  Approximately 70% of ASDI sales derive from the international EW community which provides new distribution channels for our products.  Conversely our multiplicity of offices in the U. S. provides access to new customers for ASDI products.  We expect an attractive niche market for simulation systems will emerge in developing nations as these countries recognize the need to support tactical systems they have purchased from the U.S.<P>

From a financial perspective the acquisition will improve our balance sheet and the increased profitability of the Company should provide additional support for our share price.  I also believe that investors who follow our Company will be favorably impressed by this outwardly visible signal that "CFS is on the move with new products and new markets."  I am excited by the prospects for this venture.<P>  

I am pleased to report that the Royal Malaysian Air Force has placed a $450,000 order through U.S. Navy Foreign Military Sales for nine Flight Data Recorders for installation on their F/A-18s.  This is the first order for production units.  In addition we anticipate small orders from the U.S. Navy for Flight Data Recorders for test and evaluation purposes as a consequence of successful flight testing and at-sea aircraft carrier certification.  The first of these small orders should be received before fiscal year end.  As previously announced CFS won a $7.4 million Marine Air/Ground Intelligence System (MAGIS) - TERPES support contract.  Particularly significant is that Comptek led a team composed of such prominent defense industry leaders as TRW, Lockheed-Sanders, California Microwave, SWL and Tracor-Vitro to win this award in the new area of Information Warfare.  We expect this same team will move forward to establish a level of dominance in this heavily funded, joint services initiative.<P>

<B>Investment in Telecommunications</B> - After posting quarter-to-quarter increases in revenues for the past year ARIA Wireless Systems experienced a disappointing September - December quarter.  Revenues were considerably below expectation partially as a result of the hiatus of orders from Mexico and more particularly as a result of the dissolution of a relationship with Wireless Interactive Network Communications, Inc. (WINCOMM) to market ARIA's PDDN services throughout the U. S.  Although joint ventures in Russia and China have been announced and PDDN offerings seem promising, the sales cycle is long and sufficient revenues are not being generated to offset operating expenses and provide capital to set up PDDN network infrastructure.  A plan to recapitalize and restart ARIA is being considered by ARIA shareholders and debt holders.  No assurance, however, can be given that such a plan will be adopted.<P>

<B>Outlook</B> - Comptek Federal Systems continues to exploit opportunities for growth and improved profitability and progress will be more evident in future financial reports.  We hope to participate in a revitalization of ARIA with sufficient resources to exploit the PDDN market.</blockquote><P>

Dear Fellow Shareholders: 

<P>

We are pleased to announce dramatic improvements in profitability, earnings per share (EPS) and cash position for the third quarter of 1996.

<P>

We have been pursuing a strategy to transition our business to higher-value engagements with Key Clients. This strategy has been beneficial to both our delivery teams and our Key Clients, and the transition is proceeding at a faster pace than we anticipated. The profitability of Key Client business continues to improve because we are differentiating ourselves as a value-added partner in information technology. Our significant increases in net income and EPS are direct results of the success of this strategy.

<P>

We continue to win contracts ranging from Year 2000 assessments and conversions to national outsourcing engagements. European operations continue to improve their contribution and profitability, and many of our most exciting new projects, including two new Year 2000 projects, are in Europe.

<P>

We remain committed to attracting and retaining our valuable professionals. Since the beginning of the year we have improved our use of technology to help our professionals communicate more efficiently, and take advantage of more sophisticated training programs.

<P>

To improve our shareholder communication, we are trying out this new form of quarterly reporting. We hope it will give you faster access to our quarterly financial performance.  We hope you are as pleased as we are with our continued progress and results.

<P>

Thank you for your support.

<P>

Sincerely,

<P>

BUFFALO, NY -- October 15, 1996 -- Computer Task Group, Inc. (NYSE:TSK), an information technology (IT) services company, today announced quarterly revenue of $89.4 million and operating income of $4.9 million, increases of 4.4% and 49.5% respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 1995. Operating income as a percentage of sales in the third quarter of 1996 increased to 5.4% from 3.8% in the same quarter last year. Net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $3.0 million.

<P>

Earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter of 1996 were $0.34 compared to $0.23, an increase of 47.8% over the same quarter in 1995, excluding a $3.2 million tax benefit realized in the third quarter of 1995. Third quarter 1996 net income and EPS were at their highest levels in the company’s history, excluding the tax benefit. As a result of increases in the company’s profitability and accounts receivable turnover, CTG’s cash position advanced to $33 million at the end of the third quarter.

<P>

CTG attributes its dramatic third-quarter growth in net income to the company’s Key Client strategy and its ability to attract and retain the best information technology professionals in a very competitive and supply-constrained environment. 

<P>

"We have been pursuing a strategy to transition our business from lower-margin activities to higher-value engagements with Key Clients," said Gale S. Fitzgerald, CTG’s Chairman and CEO. "We have invested our energies in Key Clients who present CTG with the greatest opportunity to form strategic partnerships and add value to their businesses. Our delivery teams find this strategy compelling, and our Key Clients have found partnership with CTG rewarding. We have clearly gained momentum in our strategy, and the transition is proceeding faster than we anticipated. 

<P>

"We attribute this momentum to the success of our competitive assets," Ms. Fitzgerald added. "With CTG-SmartSource, our powerful capability to identify and either re-assign or hire the ideal information technology professional, we can quickly apply the best talents to our clients’ challenges. As Computerworld recognized, CTG is one of the best places to work for information technology professionals. The combination of these competitive advantages with our methods, experiences and investments in training and networking, is elevating the value of CTG’s services to our Key Clients.  This is great news for the company and our shareholders.

<P>

"We are helping many companies deal with Year 2000 compliance issues, although we have not hyped that competence as others have, " Ms. Fitzgerald continued. "Year 2000 compliance is a business issue, not a technology issue, and we are actively working with Key Clients to determine the best approach. CTG’s Millennium Services draw on our methodology, our tool selection capability, and our talented and experienced professionals. CTG’s ability to attract and train professionals will serve our clients well, and we expect this area of service to grow rapidly beginning next year."

<P>

In the third quarter, CTG signed a $5.6 million contract with Palm Beach County, Fla., to create a new criminal justice computer system. The Palm Beach County board of commissioners awarded CTG a three-year contract to integrate all of the county’s criminal justice agencies on a single, efficient computer system.

<P>

"This year alone, CTG has won many national, large-scale contracts that range in scope from national outsourcing engagements to international help desk projects," said Ms. Fitzgerald. "These projects usually represent competitive initiatives for our clients. They trust CTG and recognize that our commitment to their success is real, not hype. The impact shows at the bottom line -- theirs and ours."

<P>

CTG is a leading provider of strategic variable work force solutions in information technology (IT). As a strategic partner, we provide IT services and solutions to the Fortune 500 and other companies where IT is critical to their corporate strategy. With 55 offices in North America and Europe, more than 5,000 IT professionals and our proactive sourcing approach, CTG is one of the largest and most responsive IT services firms in the industry. We are listed on the NYSE under the symbol TSK.

<P>

GREENSBORO, NC -- October 22, 1996 -- Cone Mills Corporation (NYSE:COE) announced third quarter 1996 operating results that were depressed by very weak specialty sportswear and decorative print operations and lower denim results. 
	
<P>
Third quarter 1996 sales were $180.8 million with a net loss of $2.2 million or $.11 per share after preferred dividends. For comparison, third quarter 1995 sales including the sales of the Olympic Products Division, which was sold in early 1996, were $231.7 million with net income of $5.9 million or $.19 per share. Excluding the sales of Olympic, third quarter 1995 sales were $208.2 million. 
	
<P>
Gross profit for third quarter 1996 (net sales less cost of sales and depreciation) was 12.0% of sales, as compared with 14.6% for the previous year. The decrease was primarily the result of lower volume and margins in denims. Selling and administrative expenses were down to $20.7 million, 11.4% of sales, as compared with $22.1 million, or 9.5% of sales, for the 1995 period. Even though progress is being made on reducing general and administrative costs, the current infrastructure is matched to higher levels of business activity and strategic growth initiatives. 
<P>

	Apparel fabric segment sales for the third quarter of 1996 were $154.2 million, down 14.5% from 1995 amounts. Lower denim sales due to lower volume accounted for the decrease. Third quarter 1996 operating margins for the apparel segment were 3.9% of sales, as compared with 6.9% in 1995. Margin decreases were in all product lines but primarily denim. Export sales were down 11.8% compared with the previous year's amounts. The company's denim manufacturing operations were affected by the North American supply and demand imbalance in basic denims experienced throughout the year and selective inventory imbalances in value-added denims. 
	
<P>
For the third quarter of 1996, home furnishings segment sales were $26.6 million, down 4.8% from 1995, excluding Olympic. Both the Cone Finishing and Cone Decorative Fabrics Divisions had lower sales volume in 1996 resulting from weak furniture markets and customer preference for fabrics other than prints. The home furnishings segment, excluding Olympic, had an operating loss of $4.0 million compared with a loss of $1.0 million for the 1995 period. The loss was primarily the result of lower sales volume resulting in operating levels substantially less than capacity and of charges associated with repositioning the John Wolf print lines. Cone Jacquards is operating according to plan in 1996, including expected marginal start-up operating losses.
	
<P>
For the first nine months of 1996, net sales were $588.3 million, as compared with $690.9 million for the first nine months of 1995. Excluding the sales of Olympic, the sales amounts were $583.5 million and $620.1 million respectively. Net income for nine months 1996 was $8.6 million, or $.24 per share after preferred dividends including an after-tax gain on the sale of Olympic of $2.8 million or $.10 per share. Net income for the first nine months of 1995 was $8.6 million, or $.24 per share including an after-tax charge of $8.3 million, or $.30 per share from unconsolidated Mexican affiliates related primarily to peso devaluations. 
	
<P>
For the remainder of 1996, the company sees further deterioration in operating results as it curtails operating schedules to bring selective denim inventories into balance. Cone would expect these inventory imbalances to be corrected as the company moves through the first half of 1997. In the short run, in addition to an aggressive selling program and cost reduction efforts, the company is getting out of non-core businesses, rationalizing manufacturing facilities, and reducing inventory levels and capital spending. Confident in the long-term future of Cone Mills, the company is continuing the existing common stock repurchase program. Since the beginning of the third quarter, Cone has repurchased approximately 731,000 shares of common stock.

THIRD QUARTER 1996 RESULTS<P>

<I>Continued Margin Improvement</I></B></CENTER>
<P>


<I>Reported on November 6, 1996</I>
<P>


	Coram Healthcare (NYSE:CRH) today reported revenues of $131.2 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Net loss for the third quarter was $12 million or $.28 per share.

<P>

	"We continue to show margin improvement, have continued to stabilize revenues and patient census even in what is traditionally our slowest quarter, and posted $7.4 million in operating income," said Richard M. Smith, Coram’s chief financial officer.  "During the third quarter gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 34%, an increase of 3% over the second quarter, reflecting our continued emphasis on more complex patient care and on acquiring more profitable business.  EBITDA for the third quarter was approximately $17 million, excluding non-recurring costs for major litigation and outside cash collection costs."

<P>

	"We continue to pay down our corporate debt," Smith added.  "By October 31, the company had prepaid its bank debt payment of $20.6 million scheduled for December 31, 1996.  The company reported that since October 13, 1995 its bank debt has been reduced by over $62 million."

<P>

<I><B>New Business Efforts</B></I>

<P>

	"We are very pleased with the company’s progress,"  said Donald Amaral, Coram’s president and chief executive officer.  "We have continued to improve profitability and have achieved some business successes with managed care and integrated health care systems which we believe will contribute to revenue growth.  On the provider front we have signed joint AIDS carve-out agreements with two prestigious medical centers and concluded preferred provider agreements for home intravenous therapy with City of Hope, an internationally recognized cancer care center, with a major proprietary hospital chain, and with several leading academic medical centers."

<P>

	"On the managed care side, we have established a new agreement MagnaCare, a rapidly growing PPO/HMO organization in New York,"  Amaral said.  "We have also signed a Resource Network agreement for catastrophic case management with ICM, a leading case management organization in the Northwest.  Through the Resource Network, Coram assumes responsibility for managing and delivering a wide range of outpatient health care services including home health, home infusion therapy, maternity management, respiratory therapy and home medical equipment."  Coram said that it had signed new preferred provider contracts for home intravenous therapy with several national preferred provider organizations.

<P>

	Coram also announced that it had instituted an innovative asthma management program with National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in Denver, and Managed Health Services, headquartered in Milwaukee, WI.  Under the program, which is offered to members of Managed Health’s Medicaid HMO in Northern Indiana, Managed Health, Coram, and National Jewish work together to case manage chronic asthma patients, giving patients and families new tools to manage the disease and providing new resources for the HMO’s primary care physicians. 

<P>

<I><B>Merger With IHS Announced</B></I>

<P>

	On October 21, 1996, Coram and Integrated Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:IHS), headquartered in Owings Mills, MD, announced that they had entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Integrated Health Services will acquire Coram.  The consolidated company will be the nation’s second largest home health company and the largest post-acute care company, offering a broad spectrum of services, including home nursing services, home infusion services, subacute care, inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services, skilled nursing facility care, hospice and diagnostic services. 

<P>

	The merger agreement specifies that IHS will issue 0.2111 shares of IHS common stock for each share of Coram common stock currently outstanding.  At October 19, 1996, the equity value of the merger was approximately $280 million, based on the exchange terms.  The total value of the transaction, including the assumptions of Coram’s debt by IHS and other financial obligations, will approximate $655 million.  Excluding transaction costs, IHS expects this merger to be accretive to its earnings per share in 1997 and thereafter. 

<P>

	IHS has advised Coram that IHS has entered into a settlement of the litigation involving Coram and Caremark International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MedPartners, Inc. (NYSE:MDM).  The proposed settlement is contingent upon consummation of the merger between IHS and Coram.  The lawsuit stems from the sale of Caremark’s home infusion business to Coram in April, 1995.  The suit and its counterclaims allege misrepresentations of various types by each company.  Under the contingent settlement agreement, notes of approximately $111 million that are now payable by Coram to Caremark will be canceled and replaced with a new two-year note in the principal amount of $57.5 million. 

<P>

	The merger of Coram with IHS, which has been unanimously approved (other than Andrew Nathanson, who abstained due to a conflict of interest as a managing director of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette) by the Board of Directors of each company, is subject to various conditions prior to closing.  The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization, as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, and is conditioned upon receipt of opinions from the constituent companies’ attorneys that the Merger will so qualify.  The Merger is also conditioned on IHS and Coram receiving letters, dated as of the effective date of the Merger, from KPMG Peat Marwick LLP and Ernst & Young LLP regarding the appropriateness of the pooling if interests method of accounting to be applied to the Merger.  Consummation of the Merger, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 1997, is also conditioned upon, among other things, approval by each constituent company’s stockholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals, consents of their senior bank lenders, other consents and other customary conditions.

<P>

	This release includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  These comments may differ in a material way from actual future events.  For instance, the company’s strategies and operations involve the risks of intense competition which could lead to loss of business, changing market forces, changes in technology and medical practice and the challenges inherent in developing new business relationships and introducing new services for which profitability and market acceptance have not been established.  Readers are also referred to the documents filed by the Company with the S.E.C., specifically the last reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors for the company.

<P>

Core Technologies had sales of $4.4 million in the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, compared to $4.0 million in the third quarter of 1995.  The Company reported a net loss of $61,300 or $0.01 per share, compared to net earnings of $32,200 or less than one cent per share for the third quarter of 1995.  For the first nine months of 1996 our sales were $14.2 million, compared to $13.9 million last year.  Our earnings increased to $149,200, or $0.02 per share, compared to a loss of $255,800, or $0.02 per share, for the first nine months of 1995.

<P>

Once again, Airo Clean turned in a record earnings performance on strong sales to the clean room segment of our business.  Inbound orders were also strong, and while the hospital and healthcare sector has been soft from a sales standpoint, quotation activity is picking up which is a direct result of our added distribution.  Airo Clean has met or exceeded all of their targets for the year, and we anticipate another strong quarter as we move into 1997.

<P>

While Maris made headway in several areas, the costs to complete on several of the remaining older projects have continued to undermine the gains made by Airo Clean.  We are close to finishing most of these jobs by year end and anticipate only a modest carryover into 1997.  Project work secured over the last year has met the margin targets established by management, and we are hopeful of filling up the backlog with more profitable projects.  Our quotation activity remains at a good level in all of our offices, and while pressure on the margins is always there, we are cautiously optimistic as to 1997.

<P>

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 were $26.7 million, an increase of $4.1 million from Q2 1996 and $2.2 million from Q3 1995. Thomas T. van Overbeek, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cornerstone Imaging, commented, "Third quarter revenues for both software and display products were up significantly, continuing the growth we experienced last quarter. Software revenues were a record $2.3 million, up 28% from $1.8 million in the second quarter, reflecting continued growth from both InputAccel® and our software tools product lines. Unit volumes for our display products were at a record high for the quarter as a result of our more aggressive pricing model which has enabled us to address a broader market."  

<P>

For Q3 1996, gross margins were 31.4% compared with 30.4% in Q2 1996 and 36.2% in Q3 1995. The decline in margins from Q3 1995 is attributable to lower prices for display products.  "Continued growth in higher margin software business resulted in improved margins when compared to the prior quarter." said van Overbeek.

<P>

Research and development expenses were $2.5 million for Q3 1996, or 9.3% of revenues, compared to $2.1 million, or 9.4%, in Q2 1996 and $2 million, or 8.1%, in Q3 1995. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $5.3 million, or 19.8% of revenues, level with $5.3 million, or 23.7%, in Q2 1996 and $4 million, or 16.1%, in Q3 1995. 

<P>

Net income for Q3 1996 was $430,000, or 6 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $387,000, or 5 cents per share, in Q2 1996 and net income of $2 million, or 26 cents per share, in Q3 1995 (excluding costs associated with the acquisition of Pegasus Disk Technologies).  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, revenues were $67.1 million compared with $62.4 million for the first nine months of 1995. The net loss for the current nine month period was $2.4 million, or 33 cents per share compared to net income of $3.9 million for the first nine months of 1995, or 52 cents per share. The loss for the current nine month period includes a restructuring charge of $1.4 million taken in Q1 1996.

<P>

Cash and marketable securities increased $8.8 million in the quarter to $12.8 million compared to $10.4 million at the end of 1995. Inventory at September 30 was $9.5 million, declining $7.2 million during the quarter, and down from $14.1 million at December 31, 1995. Accounts receivable decreased from $17.9 million at December 31, 1995 to $14.4 million at September 30, 1996. "We are pleased with the improved cash position and strong balance sheet. The strong demand for displays moved our inventory levels lower than projected, so we anticipate higher stocking levels in Q4 to support the anticipated revenue growth," commented van Overbeek.

<P>

<B>Management Comments</B><BR>
According to van Overbeek, "We continued execution of the plan we laid out in April to return the company to profitability. Our plan included controlling total expenses and aggressively managing the balance sheet while taking actions to accelerate revenue growth. We have moved to a more aggressive pricing strategy for our display subsystems and refreshed our color and grayscale monitor product lines. As a result, we are seeing strong increases in unit demand for our display products and have new customers outside of the production document imaging environment. Our investment of software sales and marketing resources resulted in new orders and expanded customer rollouts, particularly InputAccel Version 1.1 which began shipping during Q3. Additionally, our ActiveX control, Pixtools/EZ ™, will be included in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer Starter Kit 3.0™, thus bringing document imaging functionality to Internet/Intranet applications.  With the continued growth in all product lines and sustained expense control, we moved from break-even to profitability in the display business while narrowing the operating loss in the software business."

<CENTER><B>CCA THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME UP 110%</B></CENTER>
<P>

NASHVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 24, 1996 -- Corrections Corporation of America (NYSE: CXC) today announced net income for the third quarter of $8.5 million, up 110% from the third quarter last year and setting another record for the company.
<P>

	For the three months ended September 30, 1996, CCA earned $8.5 million, or $.10 per primary and fully diluted share, versus net income of $4.0 million, or $.06 per primary and $.05 per fully diluted share, last year.  Revenues in the 1996 third quarter were $75.2 million versus $49.5 million in the third quarter of 1995.
<P>

	For the first nine months of 1996, the company reported net income of $21.1 million, up 131% from the comparable three quarters of 1995.  Earnings per share were $.26 primary and $.25 fully diluted, while last year's earnings per share for the first nine months were $.13 and $.12 primary and fully diluted, respectively.  Revenues through September 30 grew to $205.9 million in 1996, from $144.9 million in 1995.
	
<P>
"This is CCA’s best performance yet,"  said CCA Chairman and CEO Doctor R. Crants.  "During the quarter we opened 1,700 new beds, yet our occupancy rose by four percentage points.  With continued cost controls and economies of scale, the company’s net margin exceeded 11%.
	
<P>
"We were pleased to announce another 4,400 beds under contract during the third quarter, the most for any single quarter in CCA’s history.  Year to date, we have added almost 10,000 new beds, and there are more quality business opportunities ahead of us than at any time in our history,"  Crants continued.
	
<P>
"We positioned the company to develop these and other contract opportunities by expanding our bank credit line from $25 million to $170 million during the quarter,"  he said.
<P>

CCA manages prisons and other correctional institutions for governmental agencies.  The company is the industry leader in private sector corrections with 37,905 beds in 56 facilities under contract in 16 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Australia and the United Kingdom.  CCA provides a full range of services that includes finance, design, construction, renovation and management of new or existing facilities, as well as inmate transportation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Shareholders:

<P>

Cost Plus reported continued improved results for the fiscal 1996 third quarter.  For the quarter ended November 2, 1996, the Company reported a net loss of $863,000, or $.10 per share, compared with a net loss of $1.5 million, or $.25 per share, for the fiscal third quarter ended October 21, 1995.  Net sales increased 23.6%, to $45.0 million, from $36.4 million, a year ago.  Comparable store sales for the third quarter increased 6.0%.  

<P>

For the nine months ended November 2, 1996, Cost Plus reported a net loss of $1.5 million or $.18 per share.  This compared with a net loss of $3.1 million, or $.50 per share for the nine months ended October 21, 1995.  Net sales amounted to $124.2 million, a 22.5% increase from $101.4 million, in 1995.  Year-to-date, comparable store sales were up 5.2%.

<P>

Total sales for the quarter were above our expectations.  We continued to reap the benefits of operating efficiencies that have contributed to our improvement in gross profit and overhead expenses.  Overall, same store sales in each of our categories of home decor, giftables, tabletop and consumables were up during the quarter, and we were pleased with the operating performance of our stores.

<P>

During the quarter, we opened stores in Oakbrook and Chicago, Illinois, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, and a second store in Las Vegas, Nevada.  In early November, we opened our ninth store for 1996 in Thousand Oaks, California, bringing the total of Cost Plus stores to 58 in 10 states.  The new stores opened this year have performed above our expectations.

<P>

Thank you for your support and we look forward to welcoming you to Cost Plus this holiday season.

Dear Shareholders:
<P>

	Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 1996 set a first quarter record of $18.2 million or $.60 per share, a 36% increase from the $13.3 million or $.44 per share reported for the same period last year.  Sales in the quarter were $436.5 million, up 1% from last year, and operating profit increased 19% to $34 million  Cash flow (net income plus depreciation and amortization) per share increased 19% to $.99 for the quarter. 

<P>
<HR>

<CENTER><B>CRANE CO. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>

<I>Fluid Handling</I> sales were up 17% and operating profit more than doubled in the quarter compared to the prior year.  The sales increase was due to higher nuclear product sales, stronger demand for both high performance and resilient seat butterfly valves, and continued strength in the marine market at Westad.  Higher pump shipments as a result of the acquisition of Process Systems in the fourth quarter last year  and increased demand for Chempump’s new diagnostic sealless pump also contributed to the improved performance.   In addition, Pacific Valves shipments were up significantly as low margin project business carried over from 1995.  The improved operating profit was due to the revenue increase and profitable results at Cochrane’s water treatment business which operated at a loss in the first quarter of 1995.

<P>

<I>Aerospace</I> sales increased 14% in the quarter due to higher shipments to airframe manufacturers and the repair and overhaul and spares market.  Operating profit increased 28% as all three operating units benefited from the higher sales volume and improvement in the aftermarket/OEM sales mix.  At the end of the quarter however, aftermarket backlog was somewhat lower than last year.  New orders in the commercial air transportation market remained strong, particularly for the Boeing 777 aircraft where Crane has its highest dollar per ship set value.

<P>

<I>Engineered Materials</I> sales and operating profit were down 6% and 22% compared to the first quarter last year.  Quarterly results were adversely  impacted by a 30%  drop in dry van trailer production in the United States affecting both Kemlite and Cor Tec, and a 17% decline in Canadian housing starts which affected Crane Plumbing. Operating profit was down at Kemlite and Cor Tec due to reduced shipping volume.  Results at Crane Plumbing were up slightly as improved production efficiencies more than offset the lower sales.  Resistoflex shipments were significantly ahead of last year and  profit increased 31% from 1995.  Increased  market penetration of fiberglass-reinforced panels in the recreational vehicle market will create improvement in the coming quarters.

<P>

<I>Crane Controls</I> sales and operating profit were up 2% and 20%, compared to the first quarter 1995, and operating margins improved to 10.3%.  Barksdale sales were strong due to increased air suspension valve and transducer shipments.  The benefits of the Ferguson Europe plant consolidation, completed in 1995, are being realized as higher margins resulted in a $.9 million improvement in profits for the quarter.  These improvements were partially offset by lower domestic shipments of Ferguson’s motion control products and Dynalco’s rotational speed sensors and control systems.

<P>

<I>Merchandising Systems</I> sales and operating profit were down due to the slowdown in shipments to some national accounts, the completion of the post office contract in 1995, and lower vending merchandiser sales in Europe.  Operating profit for NRI’s electronic coin validator business was up $1 million due to higher sales and the continued benefits of cost reduction programs.  National Vendors continued to expand its international distribution by adding distribution in Sweden, Holland and Spain.  National Vendors is focused on  new product introduction aimed at non-traditional vending locations and international expansion which are the key to future growth.

<P>

<I>Wholesale Distribution</I> operating profit totalled $3.6 million, nearly double the prior year level with improved results at  both Huttig and Crane Supply.  Sales were down 6% overall as a 10% improvement at Crane Supply in Canada was more than offset by lower shipments at Huttig due to poor weather conditions and lower demand for manufactured window sash and moulding products.  Crane Supply results were particularly strong with operating profit totalling 6% of sales as management continued to focus on cost controls and margins.  Cost management at Huttig also contributed to improved margins.

<P>

Interest expense in the quarter decreased $1.3 million compared to the prior year due to decreased debt.  Net debt was $279.1 million at the end of the quarter, and the net debt to capital ratio improved to 41.7%.  The company’s working capital increased $5 million to $262 million and the interest coverage ratio rose to 6.0 from 5.5 times since year end.  Miscellaneous income increased $.9 million over the prior year level.

<blockquote>Dear Shareholder,<P>

We are pleased with the financial and technological progress made during the third quarter that will help secure Cree’s position as the leading supplier of silicon carbide (SiC) based semiconductor products.  Manufacturing and yield improvements enabled us to exceed our internal LED production goals; we experienced the fourth consecutive quarter of profitability; and SiC received strong affirmation for use in microwave applications as demonstrated by a recent announcement by Westinghouse.<P>

Total revenues increased 49% to $4,023,000 over the same period last year and net income of $204,000, or $0.02 per share exceeded analysts’ expectations.  The continuing refinement of our manufacturing process resulted in considerable production advances and allowed us to recognize a significant increase in sales of LEDs over last year.  We shipped $2.1 million worth of LEDs in the first nine months of 1996 versus $500,000  for the same period last year.  We also shipped a record $1.4 million of SiC wafers during the quarter, a 58% increase over the same period last year.  Contract revenues decreased from $1.6 million to $ 1.4 million as Cree continues to transition to a product driven revenue base. While research and development support remains a critical element to our future product offerings contract revenues should continue to decline as a percentage of revenues.   Our balance sheet remains strong and our cash position of $16.4 million and working capital of $22 million can support continued, robust growth.<P>

During the third quarter, we began to see the fruits of earlier investments in technology, equipment and infrastructure.  These investments enabled us to exceed our production goal for the third quarter of 1.5 million blue LEDs and actually manufacture 2.2 million units, more than double that of the previous quarter.  This trend of doubling unit volume from quarter-to-quarter should continue throughout the coming quarters.  However, the certainty with which we meet our manufacturing goals depends on the volatility in our epitaxial process.  Epitaxy is the process by which we combine gases and grow thin layers of gallium nitride on our silicon carbide wafers. We currently have three epitaxy systems on-line, with two of these systems dedicated to commercial LED production and the other used for LED and blue laser development.  The problem in production has been, and remains to an extent, process stability.  We still face a large amount of unplanned down time because of process issues.  However each time we overcome an issue, it further stabilizes the process.  At the same time, we have increased our production wafer size to a 1.625 inch diameter and have decreased our chip size to .0013 inches from .0015 inches.  This results in  a gross chip count of over 12,000 per wafer from about 6,000 on the smaller wafer and larger chip size.<P>  

Cree is attempting to balance the external demand for blue LEDs with profitability.  We must continue to increase our manufacturing proficiency by making process improvements, increasing wafer size and decreasing chip size, so that we can offer competitive pricing while achieving an attractive gross profit margin.<P>

Sales of our Real Color Module™ are beginning to accelerate.  We have already received our first reorder from a display customer.  Our progress in securing large volume business has previously been restrained because of a lack of chip capacity.  With the situation now in hand, we are pushing the sales of modules by demonstrating our ten foot diagonal  video wall at various trade shows.  We recently demonstrated this product and met with investors at the Lehman Brothers technology exposition in New York City.<P>

The Cree/Philips laser project is still hampered  by a lack of epitaxial capacity.  However, we are beginning to make progress on the capacity front  and expect to make better progress over the next couple of quarters.<P>

Another significant development for Cree and an endorsement of SiC technology in microwave applications occurred in April when Westinghouse announced a silicon carbide based digital high definition television (HDTV) broadcast system at the National Association of Broadcasters’ convention.  Cree supplied the SiC material to Westinghouse for fabrication of the transistors used in the system.  Westinghouse noted that the solid-state transmitter will ultimately cut the cost of digital television broadcasting, accelerate the use of HDTV in the US and abroad and promises to bring cinema quality pictures and digital sound to the 21st century.<P> 

As a sign of our commitment to continue to lead the evolution of the SiC semiconductor industry we have made significant capital expenditures during the first nine months.  We spent $12 million on new equipment and a new facility to significantly expand our production line.  At the same time we have made necessary investments in personnel to fortify our expertise in this cutting edge technology and to prepare for increased production.<P> 

This quarter we made significant progress in attaining the status of volume producer of LEDs and SiC semiconductor products.  Going forward, Cree will focus on cost reductions through manufacturing improvements, while seeking strategic alliances that will complement our expertise and future growth opportunities.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Fellow Shareholders:
<P>

For the third quarter of 1996, the company recorded a net loss of $1.3 million, or $.17 a share, which reflects substantial one-time charges and legal expenses.  Excluding these charges and expenses, the company earned $1.7 million, or $.19 a share.  In the 1995 third quarter, Crop Growers earned $3.4 million, or $.41 a share.  Last year’s quarter included $3.2 million in pre-tax benefits from a change in estimated loss reserves in connection with the Dawson Hail Insurance Co. acquisition made earlier in 1995.  The prior year quarter also included adjustments to service fees and direct expenses which had a net negative pre-tax impact of  $1.0 million.  Excluding these adjustments, the company earned $2.2 million, or $.26 a share, in 1995’s third quarter.
Total revenues for the quarter were $18.4 million.  Included in that total was $6.8 million the company recognized as its share of underwriting gains with contracting insurance companies, compared with $5.2 million in 1995’s third quarter.
<P>
  For the third quarter of 1996, the company reported that it serviced $30.1 million of multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) versus an adjusted $39.2 million in the same quarter last year.  The reduction in premium serviced was primarily attributable to the transfer of policies previously serviced by the company for the Kansas Farm Bureau which is now performing those functions in-house.  MPCI premiums serviced for the nine months totaled $247.7 million, up 27.6% from the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

The 1996 quarter included non-core pre-tax charges of $3.5 million, or $.26 a share, related to a number of strategic restructuring actions being taken by the company to improve the consistency of its financial performance and improve shareholder returns.  The quarter also included fees and expenses of $1.3 million, on a pre-tax basis, or $.10 a share, related to the previously announced investigation of the company and two of its former executives by the independent counsel.
<P>
  
 We’re committed to improving our financial performance.  The necessary and prudent steps we’ve taken this quarter will improve future operations through reductions in: expenses related to non-core operations, depreciation costs and the level of non-earning assets.  For example, the consolidation of our home office and refocus on our core crop insurance business have resulted in a 12% reduction in our employee base.  The year-over-year premium decline, while disappointing, is not indicative of future results.
<P>

Exclusive of non-recurring expenses related to professional fees, moving and consolidation expenses and restructuring charges, the company’s general and administrative expenses in the quarter were $7.4 million, down $1.0 million from the previous quarter and up $600,000 from the third quarter last year. The fourth quarter of 1996 we expect our efforts to be reflected in a significant positive comparison, year over year, in the general and administrative expenses of our core operations.  We believe that our restructuring efforts are substantially complete and that we can now focus our attention on long-term competitive and performance issues.
<P>

Major components of the restructuring charge included $1.0 million in relocation expenses associated with the company’s consolidation and move of its home office, and approximately $1.7 million to adjust the book value on certain company assets, primarily real estate and mapping inventory, and the elimination of non-core subsidiary operations.  Upon completion of its restructuring and consolidation efforts, the company expects a one-time cash pick-up of approximately $5.0 million from the sale of assets and ongoing annual savings of approximately $1.3 million.
<P>
 
The management and employees of Crop Growers are dedicated to improving our core operating performance in 1997.  We appreciate your continued support of our efforts.

<CENTER><B>INTERIM REPORT<BR>
NINE MONTHS ENDED<BR>
SEPTEMBER 30, 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>


Dear Fellow Shareholders:

<P>

Net sales in the third quarter and for the first nine months of 1996 increased 72.5% and 61.6%, respectively, reflecting primarily the acquisition of CarnaudMetalbox (CMB) in late February 1996.	

<P>


Cost of goods sold, at 80.8% of sales in the third quarter, included a charge of $5.2 million for non-qualifying CMB integration costs and reflected the strong food can sales in the period.  Selling and administrative expenses continued to be contained at an acceptable level.

<P>

We recorded a pre-tax gain of  $12.6 million in the quarter primarily from the sale of real estate in the Far East.

<P>

In the Americas Division, food and aerosol can volumes in the quarter were higher than in the same period last year.  Beverage can and U. S. PET container volumes were softer than expected, due to unseasonably cool and wet weather over the period and anticipated lower aluminum can pricing in the fourth quarter. 

<P>

In the European Division, beverage can sales improved marginally but were softer than expected, while food and aerosol can sales were stronger than in the prior year's third quarter.  The Company continues to work on realigning facilities in Europe to meet the demands of this very competitive market.

<P>

The Asia Pacific markets remain very competitive notwithstanding our strong local positions.  The Division is comprised of several wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as major joint ventures in  Hong Kong (with Swire-Pacific) and in Singapore (with Fraser & Neave).  The Company is making progress with the restructuring program initiated in July at the Singapore-based venture known as CMB Asia Limited.
Total assets of the Company exceeded $12.5 billion at September 30, 1996, with total debt declining to $5.25 billion.  Debt reduction remains a top priority which will be achieved, in part, by reduced capital expenditures.  The Company generates substantial cash flow which gives us flexibility to pursue a number of alternatives to improve earnings per share in the future.

<P>

On October 24, Compagnie Générale d'Industrie et de Participations (CGIP) sold approximately half of its investment in Crown Cork & Seal in order to raise proceeds for its planned acquisition of a European auto parts manufacturer.  The Company received no proceeds from the secondary offering.  CGIP will continue to own common and preferred stock representing approximately 10.1% of the Company's outstanding stock.

<P>

We continue to regard 1996 as a merger and transition year and are satisfied with the progress to date in positioning your Company to compete in the global packaging markets of the future.

<P>

Sincerely,
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>October 31, 1996

<P>

To Our Unitholders,

<P>

Crown Pacific continued to move forward on all fronts in the third quarter, improving our production capabilities, enhancing our marketing effectiveness and strengthening our financial position. 

<P>

For the three months ended September 30, 1996, net income was $5.9 million, or $0.25 per Unit (based on 23,313,960 average units outstanding) compared to net income of $4.4 million, or $0.24 per unit (based on 18,133,527 average units outstanding) a year ago.  The increase in the number of units outstanding reflects the sale of additional units in our recently completed public offering.  Third quarter revenues were $108.8 million, up 
from $107.5 million in the same period last year.  Continued improvement in lumber prices, to near record levels for some products, along with increased sales from acquisitions completed earlier this year and during this quarter combined as the principal factors leading to the improved results. We also benefited during the quarter from our ongoing efforts to improve productivity and efficiency at all of our properties.

<P>

Looking ahead, we expect to see some normal softening in lumber prices during the upcoming winter months, but we see no reason for lumber prices to significantly retreat in 1997.  Interest rates appear to be stable, there is still pent-up demand for housing in many areas of the country, and the agreement reached earlier this year between the U.S. and Canadian governments should help preclude major price pressure coming from excess Canadian lumber on the domestic market.  

<P>

In addition, we made two strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our operations.  In September we acquired a stud mill in Marysville, Washington.  This will enable us to efficiently mill more of the timber harvested from our nearby tree farms, enhancing our margins and cash flow. We also acquired  a leading forest products wholesaler in Oregon.  This acquisition has expanded our distribution presence and bolstered our management team through the addition of the wholesaler’s former president, Jim Weeks, as Crown Pacific’s new Vice President for Marketing and Sales.

<P>

In another move to strengthen Crown Pacific for future growth, we completed a public offering for 9 million common units during the quarter, generating $165 million in proceeds to the Company.  This transaction, coupled with a $91 million senior note offering completed in August, allowed us to pay off the bridge debt used primarily to acquire the 207,000 acres of Washington and Oregon timberlands acquired from Cavenham in the second quarter.

<P>

At its October meeting, Crown Pacific’s Board approved an amendment to the Partnership Agreement that will allow the Partnership to issue 15 million Common Units, in addition to those outstanding in order to enhance our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities.  This amendment is subject to the approval of  the holders of existing Common Units, which is expected to be solicited before year-end.  

<P>

Finally, we declared a quarterly distribution of $0.524 per Unit payable on November 14, 1996 to Unitholders of record as of November 1, 1996.  We are proud of our solid record of distributions to Unitholders and believe they reflect management’s strong commitment to increasing value for all of our constituents.

<BLOCKQUOTE>To Our Shareholders:
<P>

As you can see, we have replaced our traditional quarterly report with a simplified version, in order to get our financial results to you in a timely and more cost effective manner. Using this new format, we hope to deliver our future quarterly reports to you within a few weeks of our regular news release while reducing mailing and production costs.
<P>

We are very pleased to announce that sales and income are up. The improvements are not only year to year but also quarter to quarter as well. Income is up for the fourth quarter in a row.
<P>

Sales for the quarter ending March 31, 1996 were $110,870,000 with net income of $2,486,000 or 42 cents a share. That compares to net income of $374,000 or 6 cents a share for the same quarter last year. Sales for the first six months increased by 27 per cent over the level of the first six months of last year. 
<P>

Sales were $204,834,000 and net income was $4,652,000 or 78 cents a share compared to sales of $161,575,000 and net income of $2,232,000 or 37 cents a share for the same period last year.
<P>

Sales continued to be higher in all segments of the company, with the largest increase in the Revenue Collection Group. This group produced significantly higher operating profits in the second quarter of the fiscal year when compared to last year.
<P>

Operating profits for the defense segment of our business were higher in the second quarter and for the first six months of fiscal 1996. The current results do not include any profits from the MILES 2000 contract the company won last year. We are still gearing up production for that program and expect to see increased revenues and profits from MILES 2000 in the next fiscal year. 
<P>

During the quarter, we entered into a cooperative agreement with the Transportation Systems Group of Siemens, AG of Germany. The Siemens Group is one of the largest international suppliers of rail systems technology. We expect to generate further transit related business as a result of this agreement.
<P>

On May 13, 1996 we concluded an agreement to sell Cubic Toll Systems, Inc. and certain toll road related contracts to Syntonic Technology, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of  Science Applications International Corporation. The Company also entered into separate agreements with Syntonic Technology to manufacture toll road equipment for Syntonic and to cooperate on future transportation related opportunities. Selling the toll road business will allow our Revenue Collection Group to concentrate on its profitable and growing mass transit marketplace.</BLOCKQUOTE>

CYGNUS REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

Redwood City, CA - October 16, 1996 - Cygnus, Inc. (NASDAQ: CYGN) reported total revenue of $10.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1996, compared to $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1995. Cygnus posted a net loss of $2.7 million ($.15/share) for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 compared to a net loss of $4.5 million ($.28/share) for the third quarter of 1995.

<P>

The growth of total revenue in the third quarter of 1996 compared to the second quarter of 1995 is primarily attributed to increased shipments of Nicotrolâ, Cygnus’ smoking cessation transdermal patch. The Company had total costs and expenses of  $13.8 million for the third quarter of 1996 compared to $8.4 million for the third quarter of 1995. R & D expenses for the third quarter of 1996 totaled $6.0 million compared to $5.1 million for the third quarter of 1995. This increase reflects the Company’s accelerated level of research and development costs primarily associated with the glucose monitoring system. Costs of products sold for the third quarter of 1996 totaled $6.3 million compared to $1.3 million for the third quarter of 1995 due to the increase of Nicotrol shipments as noted above.

<P>

"The third quarter was a very active one for Cygnus as we shipped a large quantity of Nicotrol patches to meet the over-the-counter launch needs of our U.S. marketing partner," said Gregory B. Lawless, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cygnus, Inc.  "In addition, we continued our development activity on the rest of our product portfolio, including the GlucoWatch™, our painless, continuous glucose monitor." 

<P>

Cash and short-term investments totaled $51.3 million as of  September 30, 1996 compared to $15.5 million as of  September 30, 1995. The increase is primarily attributed to the October 1995 public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $29.8 million and an additional $8.0 million in bank financing received in June of 1996.


<P>

 The Company's results of operations vary significantly from period to period and depend on, among other factors, the signing of new product development agreements and the timing of recognizing payment amounts specified thereunder, the timing of recognizing license fees and cost reimbursement payments made by pharmaceutical company licensees, the demand for and shipments of its Nicotrol product, and the costs associated with the manufacture of Nicotrol. The Company's contract revenue are generally earned and recognized based on the percentage of actual efforts expended compared to total expected efforts during the development period for each contract. However, contract revenues are not always aligned with the timing of related expenses.  To date, research and development expenses generally have exceeded contract revenue in any particular period and the Company expects the same situation for the next several years.  In addition, the level of revenues in any given period is not necessarily indicative of expected revenues in future periods.

<P>

Cygnus is engaged in the development of diagnostic and drug delivery systems, with its current efforts primarily focused on three core areas: a painless, bloodless glucose monitoring device, transdermal drug delivery systems and mucosal drug delivery systems.  The Company’s products in the most advanced stages of development include one in the market (Nicotrol), one submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration for approval (FemPatch™) and several in different stages of clinical trials.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Reported July 17, 1996</B></CENTER><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Shareholders:
<P>


We are pleased to report both record sales and net income 
for the second quarter of 1996.

<P>

Total revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 1996
were a record $7,704,421, representing growth of 65.6 
percent over the $4,651,124 reported for the same quarter 
of last year.  Software revenues were $3,259,003, up 41.1 
percent over the same quarter of last year; revenues for 
Application Engineering Services increased 107.1 percent 
over the same quarter of last year to $2,813,422; and technical
support revenues were $1,631,996, reflecting a 65.7 percent 
gain over the same quarter of last year.

<P>

Second quarter net income escalated 75.2 percent to $1,650,870 from $941,873 in the comparable quarter last lear.  Earnings per share were $.19 compared with 1995 second quarter earnings per share of $.13.  Shares outstanding used in the earnings per share calculations were 8.91 million in the second quarter of 1996 versus 7.24 million in the second quarter of 1995.  This quarter’s results mark the Company’s 19th consecutively profitable quarter, and its 16th successive quarter of record revenues.  

<P>

For the first six months of 1996, revenues totaled $14,605,863, an increase of 73.8 percent over the $8,400,118 achieved for the first six months of 1995.  For the first six months of 1996, net income totaled $3,189,786, an increase of 99.7 percent over the $1,596,920 achieved for the first six months of 1995.  Earnings per share* were $.36 as compared with 1995 first half earnings per share of $.26.

<P>

We experienced strong growth overall, highlighted by exceptional results in our most recently introduced products.  During the quarter we sold a record 829 units of MP2 for Windows®, which included the Windows 95 version released on June 3.  Interest in the client/server version of MP2 for Windows remains strong.  Sales of client/server in the second quarter of 1996 were up 23 percent over the first quarter of 1996 after adjusting for the impact of a large, one-time corporate sale in the first quarter of 1996.  MaintainIt® sales of 1,572 units generated revenues of $292,500, an increase of 48 percent over MaintainIt revenue generated in the first quarter of 1996.  International sales have remained strong, growing to $970,200 in the second quarter of 1996 from $539,300 in the same quarter of last year, a 79.9 percent increase.  In June, Datastream announced the final release of the maintenance software industry’s first true 32-bit completely integrated CMMS.  Version 4.6 of MP2, Datastream’s flagship CMMS, is designed for use with Microsoft® Windows 95 and Windows NT, and is available on CD-ROM.  Datastream will begin beta tests this month on MaintainIt Pro, a 32-bit Microsoft Access based CMMS package.

<P>

According to a Gartner Group industry report, broadcast by audio-teleconference on June 24, 1996, the CMMS industry is projected to grow to over $1 billion by the year 2000 from its $500 million today.  Also this quarter, Datastream was listed fifth among BusinessWeek magazine’s annual list of 100 "Hot Growth Companies" (May 27, 1996 issue).  Companies were ranked according to three-year results in sales growth, earnings growth, and return on invested capital.

DataWorks (Nasdaq: DWRX) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) business produced record revenues and earnings for second quarter 1996.

<P>

For the quarter ended June 30, 1996, the Company reported that revenues increased 52% to $11,518,000 versus $7,599,000 for the same period in 1995.  Net income rose 171% to $1,059,000 or $0.17 per share, from $391,000 or $0.12 per share in the second quarter 1995.

<P>

<I>Growth factors</I><BR>
President and Chief Executive Officer Stuart W. Clifton said, "Our growth continues to be driven by increasing demand from the largest sector of the manufacturing market -- mid-range manufacturers -- combined with DataWorks' ability to supply this demand with our highly functional, rapidly deployable ERP systems.  

<P>
	
"In addition, we have enhanced our market position by supporting important new technology trends and manufacturing techniques that assist mid-range companies in raising their effectiveness in highly competitive markets.  For example, our decision to be one of the first ERP providers to offer its full product line on Microsoft NT has clearly strengthened our leadership position in the mid-range market.  Second quarter sales to new customers using the NT platform increased 150% over the immediately preceding quarter and represented over 40% of new customer transactions.  

<P>

"We are also taking the lead in software support for another important mid-range manufacturing trend -- demand flow production.  Currently, DataWorks is partnering with certain key customers to develop the information infrastructure required to support this advanced manufacturing technique.
Ultimately, the results of our co-operative efforts will be made available to all customers.  We believe support for demand flow production will be very significant in mid-range market success over the next few years."

<P>

<I>Customer mix</I><BR>
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Norman R. Farquhar said that approximately 80% of the second quarter's non-service revenues came from new clients.  He commented, "We experienced strong demand for our ERP software both in North America and the U.K.  With our expanding presence in the U.K., we are now positioning ourselves for growth within the European mid-range market."

<P>

<I>Revenue gains</I><BR>
Farquhar said, "We continue to experience revenue growth in the software and services categories which comprised 59% and 29% respectively of second quarter revenues.  The Company continues to de-emphasize hardware sales which accounted for 12% of revenues in the quarter."

<P>

<I>Except for the historical information contained herein, this quarterly report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including variation of quarterly revenues, the significance of NT to mid-range market success, the percentage of revenues attributable to hardware and software sales and change in economic conditions of the various markets the company serves, as well as the other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including the report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.

<B>Third Quarter Report 1996</B>

 
<P>

 BURBANK, CA—The Walt Disney Company reported operating results for the third quarter and nine months ended June 30, 1996.

<P>

Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "This is the first full quarter in which Disney and Capital Cities/ABC have operated as a combined enterprise.  I am pleased not only with the results but with the smoothness of the transition we have experienced to date.  Our overall financial performance benefited from strong results in our theme parks around the world and we have also achieved impressive box office performances from our most recent theatrical releases including "The Rock," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "Phenomenon."
<P>

The following discussion of pro forma and as reported operating results excludes the impact of two non-recurring charges, described below, which were recorded by the Company during the second quarter.  To enhance comparability, the pro forma results assume the acquisition of Capital Cities occurred at the beginning of the respective periods for which information is presented.  
<P>

Pro forma revenues for the quarter increased 15% to $5.1 billion and operating income increased 15% to $956 million. Net income for the quarter increased 25% to $406 million and earnings per share increased 26% to $0.59.  Revenues for the nine-month period increased 12% to $16.0 billion and operating income increased 2% to $2.8 billion. Net income for the nine-month period increased 7% to $1.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 7% to $1.73.  The quarter and nine-month pro forma information reflect a full period of operating results for both The Walt Disney Company and Capital Cities, and a full period impact of amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, the new effective income tax rate and additional shares outstanding.
<P>

Disney President Michael S. Ovitz said, "We have made significant strides in combining Disney and Capital Cities and, as we go forward, we see more and more ways in which we plan to capitalize on our respective strengths."
<P>

Creative Content pro forma revenues for the quarter increased 24% to $2.3 billion and operating income increased 13% to $297 million.  For the nine-month period, revenues increased 17% to $7.8 billion while operating income decreased 7% to $1.2 billion.
<P>

Creative Content results for the quarter reflected successful domestic home video releases, including "Aristocats" and "Pooh Adventures," and continued worldwide consumer products licensing growth, partially offset by lower live-action film performance in the domestic theatrical market.  The nine-month period reflected declines in live-action film results in the domestic theatrical market and the write-off of certain development projects during the second quarter.  These results also reflected difficult comparisons to the prior-year period, which benefited from the domestic home video release of "The Lion King."
<P>

Broadcasting pro forma revenues increased 7% to $1.6 billion for the quarter and operating income increased 19% to $309 million.  For the nine-month period, revenues increased 5% to $4.8 billion and operating income increased 7% to $836 million.
<P>

Broadcasting results for the quarter and nine months benefited from significant reductions in program amortization and other costs attributable to the acquisition, primarily at the television network.  These reductions, together with increases in advertising and affiliate revenues at ESPN more than offset declines in advertising revenues at the television network due to continuing ratings deterioration.
<P>

Theme Parks and Resorts revenues increased 9% to $1.2 billion for the quarter and operating income grew 14% to $350 million.  For the nine-month period, revenues increased 13% to $3.3 billion and operating income rose 15% to $747 million.
<P>

Theme Parks and Resorts results for the quarter and nine months reflected record attendance and increased guest spending at Florida and California theme parks.  Attendance gains reflected increased domestic and international tourist visitation.  In addition, increased occupied room nights at Florida resorts contributed to these results.
<P>

On an as reported basis, reflecting Capital Cities’ results from the effective date of the acquisition (February 9, 1996), revenues for the quarter increased 83% to $5.1 billion and operating income rose 67% to $956 million.  Net income increased 28% to $406 million and earnings per share decreased 2% to $0.59.  For the nine-month period, revenues increased 49% to $13.5 billion and operating income rose 26% to $2.5 billion and net income increased 6% to $1.2 billion and earnings per share decreased 6% to $1.98.
<P>

These as reported results reflect significant increases in amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, the effective income tax rate and shares outstanding due to the acquisition.
<P>

Earnings per share, excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, increased 25% to $0.75 for the quarter and increased 9% to $2.29 for the nine months.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased 88% to $1.2 billion for the quarter, and increased 35% to $2.9 billion for the nine months.
<P>

As noted above, the Company recorded two non-recurring charges during the second quarter.  The Company recognized a $300 million non-cash charge related to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, and recognized a $225 million charge for costs related to the acquisition of Capital Cities.  For the nine months, these items reduced net income from $1.2 billion to $878 million and earnings per share from $1.98 to $1.47.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Shareholders:

<P>

	Earnings for the third quarter ended February 25, 1996 were $6.7 million, down from $17.2 million a year ago.  Earnings per share were $.17 compared to $.43 a year ago.  Sales for the third quarter were $718 million, 8% above last year.  For the nine months, earnings were $36.4 million or $.91 per share compared to $54.1 million or $1.36 per share last year.  Sales for the nine months increased 7% to $2.1 billion from $1.9 billion in the year ago period.

<P>
	The third quarter earnings decline is principally due to lower Specialty Foods segment earnings of $9.5 million versus $26.2 million a year ago.  The decline in earnings occurred in both the vegetable and pickle businesses.  Vegetables, which operated at a loss for the quarter, continues to be adversely impacted by lower average selling prices which are the result of increased inventory levels in the Northwest and intense competitive activity, principally in branded frozen vegetables.  Additionally, the Midwest 1995 summer vegetable harvest was materially less than the previous year’s yield and adversely affected plant operations.  Frozen vegetable prices are not expected to improve through the end of the year.  Pickle operating margins declined by 38% due to higher than anticipated promotional activity and production inefficiencies in the Southeast.  Specialty Foods segment sales of $301 million for the quarter increased by 9.5% largely due to businesses acquired.

<P>
	Dairy segment earnings declined by 12% or $1.9 million compared to the $15.4 million reported a year ago.  Dairy operations recorded volume gains with sales for the quarter of $409 million, an increase of 8.2%, however, competitive pricing negatively impacted our ice cream and extended shelf life products.  Increased raw milk costs also contributed to the decline in dairy segment earnings as a result of tight milk supplies and a greater demand for cheese and butter production.  Raw milk costs are expected to stabilize sometime during the fourth quarter.  Price increases reflecting these costs are being implemented in the fourth quarter.  Interest expense increased by $2 million in the third quarter principally due to higher borrowing levels associated with acquisitions and higher inventory levels.  The effective tax rate has been reduced to reflect lower taxable income in high tax rate states.

<P>
	The company continues its strategic review of all of its operating units and plans to report on this process in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.  Relatedly, the company continues to identify future actions that will be included in its restructuring charge, which will be announced concurrently.

<P>
	The areas of the U.S. Food Industry in which we participate continue aggressive consolidation and/or ownership changes.  Excess capacity and trade promotions have severely impacted the profit margins of all participants, and we expect these conditions to continue through the near term.  While disappointed at our recent performance, we believe our focus on strategic issues, lower costs and category leadership will ensure long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders.

Revenues for the quarter ended							September 30, 1996 were $22,067,000 compared with						$26,966,000 for the same period last year. 
 
<P>
										
Included in last year's sales are $7.8 million from our							former Vaungarde and hard tooling units, while this year's sales include $1.2 million from Vaungarde.  We	sold Vaungarde in August 1996, and shut down the hard tooling venture in May.  Sales at our three remaining core business units were	up 9%, from $19.2 million to $20.9 million.  Sales of gasoline engine cam follower rollers and axles were up substantially from new business for General Motors' light truck engine applications, while sales of diesel engine rollers and axles remained consistent with last year.  Revenues from testing services were up slightly from increased product engineering work for new customers.  Revenues from	tooling systems were down somewhat due to the soft market for prototype work in Detroit during the first quarter as automakers focused on negotiations with the UAW.										

<P>
										
Operating earnings, without the effect of the former hard tooling and Vaungarde businesses, were $1.7 million this year compared with	$2.6 million last year.  Start-up issues related to installation of the remaining equipment and training of personnel for new Chrysler CFRs to be manufactured at Upper Sandusky, Ohio, affected profitability this quarter.  However, we believe most of the impact of				these issues is behind us.  This plant should be at expected production levels during the second fiscal quarter as we begin shipments of	 rollers and axles to Eaton Corporation for its Chrysler automotive requirements.  Operating margins were also affected by the soft							prototype market, though we now see a significant increase in tooling-related business for the second quarter as Ford and Chrysler have resolved their UAW contract issues.  We continue to believe fiscal 1997 profits can return to 1995 levels, or better.

<B>Mission:</B><BR>
Diamond Multimedia serves the Internet Multimedia market by providing interactive multimedia and connectivity solutions for home, business and professional desktop computer users, enabling them to design, deliver and display compelling new media content from their desktops and through the Internet.  Products include the Stealth and Monster 3D series of media accelerators, the Fire GL series of professional 3D and CAD accelerators, and the Supra series of faxmodems and NetCommander ISDN adapters.

<P>


<B>Dear Shareholder:</B>

<P>

For the third quarter ended September 1996, Diamond Multimedia achieved net revenues of $123.7 million, up 21 percent from $102.2 million in the same quarter of 1995, and up from $120.2 million in the second quarter of 1996.

<P>

For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per share.  In the third quarter of 1995, the Company reported a net loss of $30.4 million, or ($1.08) per share, which included a $38.7 million one-time in process technology write-off related to the acquisition of Supra Corporation.  For the second quarter of 1996, the Company reported a net loss of $4.8 million, or ($0.14) per share.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 29, 1996, revenues were $431.6 million, up 55 percent from $277.6 million in 1995.  The Company reported net income of $8.5 million, or $0.24 per share, on 35.1 million shares outstanding in the first nine months of 1996, compared to a loss of $16.4 million, or $0.66 per share, in the first nine months of 1995, which included the $38.7 million one-time in process technology write-off related to the acquisition of Supra Corporation.

<P>

At September 29, 1996, Diamond had $121.8 million in cash and short-term securities, up $23.7 million from the end of the second quarter.  Other elements of the balance sheet were also in good condition, including accounts receivable at 42 days sales outstanding.

<P>

As we look forward to the final quarter of 1996, we are encouraged by the stronger tone to the overall PC market and the new products we are introducing to support our Internet Multimedia business mission.  The market appears to be particularly promising for 3D graphics and telephony modems supporting speakerphone capability.  In addition, we plan to start shipping a PC video phone kit and a European ISDN modem during the fourth quarter.  You can keep track of our progress during the quarter by periodically visiting our Internet web site at <A HREF="http://www.diamondmm.com">www.diamondmm.com</A>.

To Our Shareholders

<P>

We are pleased with the third quarter 1996 results as Digital Link experienced record revenues for the quarter.  Revenues and income grew 17% and 74%, respectively, over the second quarter of 1996.  The balance sheet remained strong with Accounts Receivable DSO’s declining and higher cash balances.  In addition, during the third quarter, the Company announced that the Board of Directors of Digital Link has authorized the repurchase of 500,000 shares of common stock, dependent on market and business conditions.

<P>

	We believe our growth during the third quarter was as a result of the growth of Frame Relay and Internet markets.  Our two product segments, Narrowband and Broadband, showed good growth.  Narrowband, the T1 and lower speed products, and Broadband, products with higher than T1 speed, were  53% and 47%, respectively, of the quarter’s revenue.  Narrowband was up 15% and Broadband was up 20% over the second quarter of 1996.

<P>

	For the third quarter, our domestic business accounted for 82% of our revenues, while international accounted for 18%.  The domestic business proved strong and grew 17%, compared to last year and 14% sequentially.  Our international business was down by 3%, compared to last year, but sequentially rose by 36%.  We have continued to strengthen our domestic markets, both with the carriers and Enterprise customers.  For the international markets, the Company has introduced new products which are undergoing homologation in different countries currently.

<P>

	One of the Company’s primary areas of focus has been to broaden our customer base.  We have seen good progress during the third quarter as MCI was the only customer to account for more that 10% of the Company’s revenue, registering 16% of sales.  Our business with other major customers, such as BBN Planet Corporation, Seimens, Alcatel, and NTT/PC, remained very good.  In addition, we have added over 50 new Internet Service Providers as new customers since the beginning of this year.

<P>

	With regard to new products, we have concentrated our efforts in enhancing the network management capabilities across our product line.  Enhanced network management capabilities are being introduced on many of our stand-alone CSU’s/DSU’s and the central site Ensemble shelf for both domestic and international markets.  We believe the major network service providers and large end-user customers view network management capabilities as the biggest differentiation of WAN Access products.

<P>

	To date, the progress on our GateWay development has been very good.  The GateWay product platform is intended as a feeder to WAN ATM backbone switches.  We have done several minor integrations throughout the last several months and we believe that this product will be available for customer evaluation shipment in December.  We are continuing to present the product to potential customers and partners on a limited basis.

<P>

	I am also pleased to announce that during the third quarter we added to the strength of our management team with the addition of Alan Fraser as President and CEO of the Company.  Alan brings more than 18 years of experience in the telecommunications industry.  He was Group Vice President for the Nortel (Northern Telecom) flagship central office switching business and held several key executive positions at the company.  Under his leadership, we intend to build upon our existing strengths and to become a stronger market driven data communications equipment supplier.

<P>

	Overall the third quarter was another solid quarter from the standpoint of bookings, revenues, profits, and the balance sheet.  We continue to work diligently in establishing Digital Link very competitively in the marketplace.

<P>

Sincerely,

We are proud to report another strong quarter both in net

of fiscal 1995. Comparable store sales increased 
8.3%. Operating income increased 89% to $9.5 million, compared
to the $5.0 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal 1995.
Net income increased 89% (after excluding non-taxable life insurance
proceeds of $4.8 million received in the first quarter of fiscal
1995) to $4.7 million, compared to the $2.5 million reported during
the first quarter of fiscal 1995. Net income per share for the
first quarter was $.34, compared to the $.17 per share (after

<P>


To become the pre-eminent ice cream Company in the United States.

<P>

<U>Business Plan:</U></B></CENTER>
<P>


Since mid-1994, the Company has been executing a long-term strategic plan (the "Grand Plan") designed to achieve its mission by the year 2000. The key elements of this plan are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Build a high margin brand with a leading market share through effective consumer marketing activities;
<LI>Expand the Company’s direct-store-delivery distribution network to national scale and leverage this capability with sophisticated information systems.
<LI>Introduce innovative new products.
</UL>

<CENTER><U><B>Results of the Third Quarter of 1996<BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>As reported on Wednesday, October 30, 1996</FONT></B></U></CENTER>

<P>

Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc. (NNM - DRYR) announced record sales for the third quarter ended September 28, 1996, according to T. Gary Rogers, Chairman.  Consolidated net sales for the thirteen week period were $234,644,000, an increase of 14 percent over the $205,226,000 of sales in the third quarter of 1995.  Net sales for the first thirty-nine weeks of 1996 were $613,182,000, compared with $534,564,000 for the same period last year, an increase of 15 percent.

<P>

Net income for the third quarter totaled $3,305,000, or $.15 per common share after paying preferred stock dividends, compared with earnings of $1,554,000, or $.07 per common share, in the third quarter of 1995.  Net income for the first three quarters of the year totaled $10,009,000, or $.47 per common share after paying preferred stock dividends, compared with $5,540,000, or $.36 per common share, for the same period in 1995.

<P>

Two significant and unprecedented factors are having a negative effect on the profitability of virtually every ice cream manufacturer in the country in 1996.  First, dairy prices have risen to levels that are more than thirty percent higher than in 1995.  Second, total gallon consumption of ice cream is down in 1996, due primarily to weak sales of certain ice cream products in the "good for you" segment. Our total sales have increased and out-paced the industry in 1996, and our products in this particular segment, including Dreyer’s and Edy’s Fat Free, No Sugar Added and Frozen Yogurt, have retained their market share leadership position.  Nevertheless, the Company’s gross profit margin was 23.2 percent for the third quarter, down from 24.6 percent for the same quarter in 1995.  Increased dairy costs and a higher proportion of partner brand sales were the primary causes of this decrease in margin, and were partially offset by improved distribution expenses and certain adjustments to accrued liabilities.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales for the quarter, primarily due to comparatively lower marketing expenditures.

<P>

We continue to pursue our mission by executing the key elements of our long-term strategic plan.  Our focus on brand building television advertising and consumer promotion has been an important factor in sustaining share leadership during a difficult year for the industry.  Similarly, product and process innovation has diversified the Dreyer’s and Edy’s product line across virtually every ice cream segment, leaving us less vulnerable to weakness in any one segment. That diversity will increase as we continue to introduce innovative new products like Dreyer’s and Edy’s Whole Fruit™ Sorbet, already a strong contender in the growing sorbet segment, and Starbucks® Ice Cream, already the best selling coffee ice cream in the country.  While we expect that high dairy prices and softness in the category could negatively affect the industry and Dreyer’s for the balance of 1996, we are steadily strengthening our competitive position and making good progress against our plan.

The Company has discontinued sending
quarterly reports to shareholders, but will 
send the quarterly earnings release that is
distributed to the financial community 
and business media.  This will allow
shareholders to receive interim information
in a more timely manner and at a lower
cost to the Company.

	<CENTER><B>DYCOM ANNOUNCES 72% INCREASE IN FIRST QUARTER EPS</B></CENTER>
<P>


Dycom Industries, Inc. (NYSE: "DY") today announced its operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 1997. The Company reported net income for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 1996 of $1,662,000, or $0.19 per common and common equivalent share on total revenues of $40,367,000. These results compare to net income of $969,000, or $0.11 per common and common equivalent share on total revenues of $37,606,000.  Net income per common share, assuming full dilution, was $0.19 per share for the quarter ended October 31, 1996 as compared to $0.11 for the corresponding period last year.

<P>

The Company reported that total revenues for the first quarter increased 7% as a result of higher volumes in the telecommunication services and the utility line locating services groups as compared to the same period last year. Net income increased 72% over last year due to the higher revenue volumes, improved operating efficiencies, and the reduction in general and administrative expenses during the quarter.

<P>

The Company reported a backlog of uncompleted contract work at October 31, 1996 of $224,100,000 as compared to $228,000,000 at July 31, 1996.  
Dycom provides installation, maintenance, engineering, and other comprehensive services to the telecommunication and electrical utility industries and private enterprises nationwide through its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

<BLOCKQUOTE>To Our Shareholders, Customers and Employees:

<P>

	Fiscal 1996 continues to be an outstanding year for Eagle Hardware & Garden.  The strength in sales we reported to you at the conclusion of the second quarter continued in the third quarter.  In addition to record third quarter earnings, our Company recorded a 19% increase in same store sales.  Equally important, in September we successfully completed an offering of 5,750,000 shares of Common Stock that raised approximately $125 million for the Company.	
	
<P>
Including our 25th store that opened in Wenatchee, Washington, sales during the third quarter increased 24% from $159.8 million in the third quarter of the prior year to $198.7 million this year.   After  tax income  from operations for the quarter increased 
122% to $5.5 million, or $0.21 per share, from net income of $2.5 million, or $0.11 per share, in the same quarter last year. The Company also recorded $2.1 million, or $0.08 per share, of nonrecurring income from a capital gain on the sale of surplus property during the third quarter.  Including this nonrecurring income, net income increased 207% to $7.6 million, or $0.28 per share, fully diluted.  Net income per primary share for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 reflected a 13% increase in the average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding compared to the prior year.  
<P>

	Our 6.25% convertible subordinated debentures were dilutive in the third quarter, and accordingly were assumed to be converted into common shares for purposes of calculating fully diluted net income per share.  Had the debentures not been dilutive, the Company's net income per share for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 would have been $0.29.
	
<P>
For the first 39 weeks of fiscal 1996, sales increased 24% to $568.9 million from $457.7 million in the first 39 weeks of 1995.  Net income for the first nine periods of the year increased 92% to $18.6 million, or $0.74 per share, fully diluted, from net income of $9.7 million, or $0.42 per share, for the same period a year ago.
	
<P>
Our 122% increase in after tax income from operations and 19% increase in same store sales were due to a number of factors, including store closures by a primary competitor, favorable economic climates in most of our markets and continued strong consumer preference for the Eagle concept.  Gross margin, also a key contributor to the increase in net income, improved primarily as a result of volume-related buying efficiencies and a reduction in realized inventory shrinkage attributed primarily to loss prevention programs.

<P>
	After repaying approximately $42 million in outstanding borrowings on our bank line of credit, the balance of the proceeds from our $125 million stock offering will be used to finance a significant portion of our planned expansion through fiscal 1997 and for general corporate purposes.
	
<P>
We plan to complete our fiscal 1996 store opening plans next month with two store openings in Colorado, one near Boulder and one in Pueblo.  The Company also has stores under construction in North Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, and Kahului (Maui), Hawaii.  In addition to these stores,  which are currently planned for opening in early fiscal 1997, we have purchased a site and signed an agreement for another site planned for opening in fiscal 1997 in the Denver, Colorado market.  We continue to actively review additional sites for future expansion.
	
<P>
Thank you for your continued support of Eagle Hardware & Garden and we look forward to reporting our continued growth to you in the future.

<blockquote>
Dear Shareholder:

<P>

	We are pleased to report that funds from operations were $4,665,000 ($.66 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 1996 compared to $2,512,000 ($.59 per share) for the same period of 1995, an increase of 12% per share.  Funds from operations were $10,193,000 ($1.90 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 and $7,378,000 ($1.75 per share) for the same period last year, an increase of 9% per share.

<P>

	Funds from operations increased as a result of the benefits of the mergers with Copley Properties, Inc. and LNH REIT, Inc. which were completed during the second quarter.  The operations from Copley and LNH have only been included since the respective merger dates, and had an accretive effect on funds from operations per share for the quarter ending September 30, 1996.  Also contributing to the increase in funds from operations was the 4.5% increase in property net operating income from the same industrial properties held in both 1996 and 1995.

<P>

	The Trust currently has three apartment complexes and one shopping center under contract for sale.  The Trust is continuing to implement its strategy of redeploying noncore asset investments into sunbelt market industrial properties with special emphasis in the growth states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, and California.  During the third quarter, the Trust sold 33 acres of non-earning land in Pompano Beach, Florida for $3,272,000, an 85 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Houston, Texas for $646,000, a 25,200 spare foot industrial building in Hayward, California for $1,060,000 to the building’s tenant who exercised his purchase option, and 243,000 shares of Liberte stock for $844,000.  The Trust recognized total gains of $152,000 on these sales.

<P>

	The Trust used these proceeds and borrowed funds to acquire two properties.  In August, the Trust acquired the 234,070 square foot Walnut Business Center in Fullerton, California for a purchase price of approximately $8,125,000 ($34.73 per square foot), and, in September, the Trust acquired the 259,352 square foot Braniff Park West in Tulsa, Oklahoma for a purchase price of approximately $5,675,000 ($21.88 per square foot).  As a result of the Copley and LNH mergers and the acquisitions discussed previously, the Trust has added 14 industrial and office properties with 2,618,000 square feet of leasable space, and increased the Trust’s ownership of industrial space to approximately 5,000,000 square feet.

<P>

	The Trust paid dividends of $.49 in the third quarter of 1996 (an increase of 4.3% per share from the previous quarter) and $1.43 for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 which represented 75% of funds from operations.  The Trust is currently paying an annualized dividend of $1.96 per share and expects to pay its next quarterly dividend at the end of December.

The Company has discontinued sending quarterly reports

allow shareholders to receive interim information in a 
more timely manner and at  a lower cost to the Company.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>EASTERN BANCORP REPORTS A 39% INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS AND A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN NONPERFORMING ASSETS</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

Williston, Vermont...Eastern Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:EBCP) had net income of $1.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 1996.  This represents a  $423,000 or 39 percent increase over the same period last  year.  Earnings per share were $0.60 for the second quarter of fiscal 1996. This compares to $0.44 per share in the prior year, a 36 percent increase.  Net income for the six months ended March 31, 1996 was $2.99 million compared to last year’s six month results of $2.28 million, a 31 percent increase.  Earnings per share for the fiscal 1996 six month period were $1.19 compared to last year’s $0.93, a 28 percent increase.
<P>

	In announcing earnings, John Cobb, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated "Special recognition should go to the collections staff at Vermont Federal Bank whose diligent efforts produced a significant decline in nonperforming assets.   Nonperforming assets dropped from 2.3 percent of assets at December 31, 1995 to 1.8 percent of assets at March 31, 1996, a $4.1 million decrease.   In addition,  total delinquencies of all loans fell by more than $8.8 million during the second quarter."
<P>

	Mortgage lending increased sharply. Mortgage loan originations for the quarter ended March 31, 1996 were $45.5 million compared to $18.5 million in the same quarter last year, a 146 percent increase.  For the six months ended March 31, 1996, mortgage loan originations were $81.4 million compared to last year’s $43.5 million, an 87 percent increase.  A surge in refinancing in our Vermont division coupled with our expanded consumer banking strategy in our New Hampshire division produced these outstanding results.
<P>

	Eastern Bancorp’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend  of $0.18 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 1996.  The dividend is payable on May 15, 1996 to shareholders of record on May 1, 1996. 
<P>
 
	During the quarter ending March 31, 1996, the New Hampshire division’s marketing  of Totally Free Checking, Vermont Federal Bank’s premier deposit product, hit a milestone.   Since the product’s introduction in the New Hampshire markets in May of 1995, new accounts opened surpassed the 10,000 mark.  The growth of this product  contributed to the continued growth in customer services fees.  For the quarter ended March 31, 1996, customer services fees increased to $1.3 million, an 11 percent increase over the prior year’s second quarter.  Customer service fees increased to $2.7 million for the six month period, an 8 percent increase over the prior year period.  
<P>

	Net interest income remained stable when compared to the prior year period for both the three and six month comparisons.  Non-interest income increased 3 percent for the three month period when compared to the same period last year. This increase is largely attributable to increased customer service fees as well as gain on sale of investments.  Non-interest income for the  six month period increased 19 percent when compared to the prior year.  This increase is due primarily to gain on sale of investments, gain on sale of loans, and customer service fees.  Non-interest expense decreased slightly during both the three and six month periods when compared to the same prior year periods.  
<P>

	Eastern Bancorp, Inc. is the unitary savings and loan holding company of Vermont Federal Bank, FSB of Williston, Vermont.  During the second quarter of fiscal 1996, Vermont Federal Bank opened an office in Rutland, Vermont bringing the total operating offices to twenty-five,  fifteen offices in Vermont and ten offices in New Hampshire.

<blockquote>June 7, 1996<P>

To Our Shareholders:<P>

	For the third quarter of fiscal year 1996 we achieved net income from major restructuring success and an 80% reduction in our operating loss as compared to the same quarter in the prior year.<P> 
	We recorded net income of $1,351,000 or $0.15 per share for the three months ended March 31, 1996, as compared to a net loss of ($2,152,000) or ($0.24) per share for the same period in the prior year. Included in the 1996 third quarter financial results was a reversal of accrued restructuring charges of $1,550,000 or $0.17 per share resulting from a favorably negotiated termination of the Company's Worcester, Massachusetts facility lease.  Also included in the 1996 third quarter was a gain of $241,000 or $0.03 per share relating to the settlement of $501,000 of EcoScience Produce Systems Corp. acquisition debt. Excluding the restructuring reversal and the gain on debt settlement, the Company had a 1996 third quarter operating loss of ($440,000) or ($0.05) per share, which represents an 80% reduction when compared to the operating loss of ($2,152,000) or ($0.24) per share for the same period in the prior year. Due to seasonality, total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 1996 declined to $3,139,000 as compared to $3,938,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 1995.  However, for the nine months ended March 31, 1996 total revenues increased to $11,628,000, which represents a 16% increase when compared to total revenues  of $10,064,000 for the same period in the prior year.<P>
	The present EcoScience management team has surpassed expectations and successfully achieved a majority of our restructuring objectives, and has put in place strict cost reduction measures.We can now  intensify our pursuit of the opportunities to grow the Company's operating divisions, Agro Dynamics and EcoScience Produce Systems, and further the expansion and commercialization of our biological product technologies, Bio-Save™ PostHarvest BioProtectant, Bio-Blast™ termiticide and the second generation Bio-Path® Cockroach Control Chamber.<P> 
	I look forward to continuing to share EcoScience's progress and success with you.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Third Quarter Report 1996</B>
<P>



October 23, 1996

 

<P>


Dear Shareholders:

<P>

I am pleased to introduce you to our new quarterly report to shareholders.  This format is designed to provide you with quarterly highlights in a cost-effective and timely fashion.  

<P>

Today Edify Corporation reported that it achieved record revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996.

<P>

Revenues for the quarter were $9.1 million, an increase of 100% from $4.5 million for the same quarter in 1995. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 were $21.8 million, an increase of 105% from $10.6 million for the same period one year earlier.

<P>

Our continued growth in revenue reflects our focus on penetrating the significant market potential for Web/Intranet and telephony self-service applications.  We continue to invest heavily across all functional areas within the company in order to exploit this self-service opportunity.

<P>

During the third quarter, Edify added several prominent new customer names, including Dollar Bank, Janus Capital, Pratt & Whitney, Twentieth Century and Xerox.

<P>

We also experienced strong follow-on purchases from some of our existing customers, including Aetna, AT&T, Chase Chemical Bank, Eastman Kodak, First Union, MCI and NationsBank.

<P>

Edify continues to focus its sales and marketing efforts on the overall self-service software market, with particular concentration on the financial services and human resources segments.  In order to achieve leadership in these segments, Edify is developing 
targeted application products, as well as forming strategic relationships with leading technology providers, integrators and outsourcers in the financial services and human resources arenas.

<P>

In support of this strategy, Edify made several significant announcements impacting the financial services segment during the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter.

<P>

In September, Edify began shipping the Electronic Banking System (EBS), its first application product for the financial services market.  EBS is based on the Electronic Workforce, the company’s self-service software platform, and offers financial institutions the means to deploy a suite of automated banking services via the World Wide Web.  EBS is the first product to combine Web banking services with optional electronic banking capabilities that support self-service via telephones, fax and personal financial management software.

<P>

Also in September, Edify announced strategic relationships with Intuit and Hewlett-Packard, leading technology providers in the financial 
services market.  Edify will enhance EBS to support Intuit’s new OpenExchange specification, enabling financial institutions to leverage EBS to build a direct banking connection to the millions of users of Intuit’s Quicken software package.

<P>

Edify also will support Hewlett-Packard’s VirtualVault security solution as part of Edify’s fully integrated Web banking offering.  Edify became an HP Independent Software Vendor Partner and Edify products will be promoted as part of HP’s offerings for electronic commerce solutions.

<P>

In addition, Edify and Applied Communications (ACI), a global leader in electronic banking and 
payments solutions, announced the signing of a joint marketing agreement to provide a comprehensive solution that will enable customers to do their banking over the World Wide Web.  Banks using ACI’s BASE24 systems can now extend customer access to their accounts through both the Web and telephone via Edify’s EBS.

<P>

Edify also made two key announcements early in the fourth quarter.  Edify and NCR Customer Information Services, a leading provider of transaction processing and information management products and services for financial institutions, have entered into a licensing and distribution agreement.  NCR will use Edify’s EBS application to provide its 600 financial institution customers with a fully outsourced Web banking solution.  NCR became the first major outsourcer to offer Edify’s Web banking solution.

<P>

Finally, Edify announced that it had signed a product licensing agreement with AT&T pursuant to which AT&T will use EBS as the electronic banking platform for the Atlanta Internet Bank, a new Internet-based banking service provided by Carolina First Bank.  The Advanced Network Solutions division of AT&T selected and implemented EBS in their role as the system and technology integrator for Atlanta Internet Bank.  With Atlanta Internet Bank now open for business over the World Wide Web, they become the first installation of Edify’s EBS in full production.

<P>

Beyond the financial services and human resources segments, Edify continues to target customers and recruit partners in the overall self-service market.  Toward that end, Edify and Fujitsu Business Communications Systems (FBCS), announced the signing of a joint development and reseller agreement in August.  Fujitsu and Edify will jointly develop computer telephony integration (CTI) applications using Edify’s Electronic Workforce platform in tandem with Fujitsu’s F9600 Multimedia Platform PBX.  The new CTI applications as well as Electronic Workforce software will be sold through FBCS’s nationwide salesforce.

<P>

Internally, we continued our heavy investment across all areas in the company, bringing our headcount total to over 250.  We also are expanding our existing facilities in Santa Clara and recently opened professional services and training offices in Boston and Dallas.

<P>

Edify maintains a strong balance sheet with $43.8 million in cash and no debt at September 30, 1996.  With a solid product and financial foundation, I believe Edify continues to be well positioned to exploit the rapidly growing market for self-service software.  Thank you for your ongoing support of Edify.

<P>

Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS</B></CENTER>

<P>

 To Our Shareholders
<P>

	We are pleased to report operating results for the 1996 third quarter and nine months ended September 28, 1996 which reflect another consecutive quarter of improved operations.
	
<P>
Net income for the third quarter period ended September 28, 1996 was $842,000, or $0.14 per share after the net effect of a $7.6 million provision for a loss on the discontinuance of the Company’s participation in its energy-related operations, including provision for operating losses during the phase out period, and a $7.1 million gain from the curtailment of post-retirement healthcare benefits for Medicare eligible retirees.  In the comparable 1995 period, we reported net income of $477,000, or $0.08 per share.
	
<P>
Earnings from continuing operations before taxes in the 1996 third quarter increased 25% to $1,867,000, before the aforementioned $7.1 million gain, from $1,495,000 earned in the same period a year ago.  Sales from continuing operations for the 1996 third quarter increased 24% to $23,107,000 from $18,634,000 reported in the similar period a year ago.
	
<P>
For the first nine months of 1996, we reported net income of $2,242,000, or $0.37 per share after the above noted special items, compared to $869,000, or $0.15 per share, reported a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes in the 1996 first nine months increased 38% to $5,277,000, before the aforementioned $7.1 million gain, from $3,811,000 earned in the same period a year ago.  Sales from continuing operations for the first nine months of 1996 increased 22% to $71,547,000 from $58,461,000 in the prior year.
	
<P>
Our order backlog from continuing operations decreased to $81,754,000 at September 28, 1996 from $87,345,000 reported in the third quarter a year ago.  The decline stems principally from timing delays in the receipt of certain contracts, including a major contract for an international customer received after the quarter ended and disclosed in an October 21, 1996 press release.  Backlog as of October 21, 1996 was approximately $101 million.  The backlog reported for the third quarter includes follow-on orders under long-term contracts for Mk 105 Airborne Mine Countermeasures System Upgrade Kits for the U. S. Navy, F-15E Bomb Release Units for the U.S. Air Force and piezo-ceramic elements for the Sparton and Magnavox sonobuoy programs.
	
<P>
Our third quarter shows a continued improvement in operations. EDO is a strong, technology rich company that offers the potential for tangible growth in today’s business environment.  Our backlog, and the contract mix, are reflective of the underlying strength of our core businesses in both defense and commercial markets and substantiates our strategy of focusing on providing key niche proprietary products to major defense prime contractors and commercial original equipment manufacturers.
	
<P>
In order to maximize the return to you, our shareholders, our current strategic plan is to concentrate our resources on those core businesses which have demonstrated the ability to grow and provide increased profit margins. The implementation of our plan also includes growing the Company by internal funding of new products and aggressively pursuing new and complementary products through selective acquisition.
	
<P>
We are divesting those operations that either do not fall within the purview of this primary strategic initiative or require financial and management resources to reach their potential that dilute our ability to fully focus on maximizing returns.  Accordingly we have already sold our Seaplane Float operations and are in the process of selling an instrument line at EDO Electro-Optics.
	
<P>
We have made the decision to also discontinue our participation in the alternative fuels market.  We believe alternative fuels represents a viable industry with longer-term potential. While we have several new opportunities in energy related markets, the rate of growth and financial returns do not meet our current strategic criteria.  Therefore, we are actively seeking knowledgeable and financially sound investors for these businesses which have a commitment to the continued long term development of these business operations and the necessary resources to fully meet that commitment.  While that process is taking place, we will continue to responsibly operate these businesses as we have done since entering the industry.
	
<P>
Our decision to discontinue medical benefits for our Medicare eligible retirees reflects the popularity of Medicare HMOs, and our success in converting retirees’ health coverage to such plans which are typically less costly to them and to us and provide them with broader and more centralized services.
	
<P>

<blockquote>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:

<P>

	Our recently completed third quarter reflected continued progress toward the comprehensive brand transformation strategy that is underway at El Chico.  This strategy centers around:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Moderate expansion of new units incorporating our new prototype design, 
<LI>Overall facility enhancement through remodels that include prototype design elements,
<LI>Menu evolution resulting in greater variety of products offered,
<LI>Increased sale of alcoholic beverages, primarily beer and margaritas,
<LI>Superior operational execution, and
<LI>Increased advertising using television as the primary media.
</UL>
<P>

While the quarter was not without its challenges, we are pleased to report progress from the first two quarters this year.
	
<P>

	For the third quarter, we had net earnings of $1,343,000, or $0.35 per share, which included an after-tax gain on the sale of property to a franchisee of $0.4 million, or $0.10 per share.  Revenues for the quarter decreased 3.3% to $25,979,000 from $26,879,000 a year ago.  Comparable Company-operated El Chico restaurant sales declined 4.6%, and comparable franchised stores declined 5.7% for the quarter.  During the third quarter, the Company opened one new unit, closed two previously impaired restaurants and converted one impaired unit to a franchise.

<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, we had a net loss of $3,880,000, or $0.98 per share, which included a previously recorded after-tax charge of $6.2 million associated with exiting certain of our restaurants and impairing certain other restaurants and long-lived assets, as well as $0.8 million of after-tax gains on the sale of non-impaired properties.  Excluding the nonrecurring impairment charge and property gains, net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 would have been $1,545,000, or $0.39 per share, compared with $2,748,000, or $0.68 per share last year.  Year-to-date revenues increased 0.8% to $78.8 million from $78.2 million for the same period a year ago.
	
<P>

	While we continue to experience pressure on sales and some food cost inflation, we made further progress in the quarter toward returning to better operating performance.  We were able to control our labor costs despite the sales softness and to bring our food-cost waste factor in line with historical levels.  In addition, our results benefited from lower pre-opening expenses relative to the same period a year earlier.

<P>

	Our main objective, however, is to improve our profitability by improving our sales performance.  Apart from new menu offerings, remodels, and increasing emphasis on service, we are addressing the sales challenge head-on with an aggressive radio and television media campaign.  The campaign, which was launched in the last week of September and will continue into November, is designed  to stimulate sales in the slower pre-holiday period and build momentum going into the all-important holiday season.  We are optimistic about this initial effort at an expanded advertising program and are hopeful that these efforts will benefit sales going forward.
	
<P>

Sincerely,</blockquote><P>

Dear Shareholder:

<P>

	We are very pleased to report that both revenues and earnings increased during the third quarter, which reflects continued growth for EDI in the military memory and flat panel display markets.
	
<P>
Pro forma revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 1996, which ended June 30, 1996, increased 47 percent to $16.1 million from $11.0 million in the third quarter of the prior year.  Net income for the third quarter increased to $1.3 million, or $0.15 per share, from a net loss of $0.9 million, or $0.28 per share, for the comparable period in fiscal 1995.  Weighted average shares for the three months ended June 30, 1996 were 9.9 million, compared with 3.2 million in the comparable period.  The increase in shares is primarily attributable to the financing of the Company’s (formerly Crystallume) acquisition of Electronic Designs, Inc. in October 1995.  We continue to report our financial results on a pro forma basis in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of the results for the combined operations of the Company and its results prior to the October 1995 merger with Crystallume.
	
<P>
For the nine months ended June 30, 1996, EDI reported that pro forma revenues increased 70 percent to $45.8 million, from $27.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 1995.  After non-recurring merger-related charges of $1.7 million incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 1996, net income was $1.5 million, or $0.24 per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 1996, compared with a net operating loss of $2.8 million, or $0.88 per share, for the same period in the prior year.  The Company’s results of operations for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 include the combined operations of the Company and EDI-MA from October 10, 1995, the day EDI-MA was acquired in a transaction accounted for under the purchase method.  
	
<P>
EDI’s core business, packaging enhanced memory modules, continued to thrive this quarter.  We have been able to capitalize on demand from our military customers and our target high-end telecommunications and network commercial customers.  
	
<P>
Increases in output and decreases in demand for memory chips by the personal computer industry in the first quarter of the year created a significant surplus of memory inventory, resulting in a decrease in commercial memory chip prices.  EDI is enjoying these lower prices from our memory suppliers and, since we are essentially a “pass through” value-added supplier to our customers, our selling prices for modules will be correspondingly lower.  While this may affect revenue in the short term, we expect the lower prices to stimulate increased unit demand in the future.
	
<P>
Our flat panel display business grew during the third quarter, primarily due to new orders from avionic customers for our ruggedized, customized flat panel displays, which are being used in a variety of applications requiring sunlight readable systems.  On the commercial display side, EDI has developed a flat panel display with Global Positioning System (GPS) capabilities. Through a collaboration with Avidyne, a start-up company created by Shiva-founder Dan Schwinn, Avidyne and EDI currently are marketing this GPS flat panel display system for private aircraft.  The GPS systems enable airplane pilots to perform such functions as tracking weather patterns to pinpointing landing strips.
	
<P>
In addition to growing our core memory and display businesses, we are developing new commercial products for customer applications that require our proprietary diamond technology.  In fact, we still anticipate producing a diamond-based memory module by the end of 1996, which should be faster due to diamond’s inherent heat-dissipating qualities.
	
<P>
We look forward to reporting our achievements to you during the fourth quarter, and thank you for your interest in and support of EDI.

<P>

Sincerely,

<blockquote>To Our Shareholders:

<P>

	For our second quarter ended June 30, 1996, EMCON reported net income of $365,000 or five cents per share on net revenues of $30.5 million.  In the same quarter of 1995, we reported net income of $711,000, or nine cents per share, on net revenues of $26.5 million.  For the first six months of 1996, our net income was $399,000 or six cents per share on net revenue of $55.1 million, compared with net income of $1.1 million, or 14 cents per share, on net revenue of $52.7 million in the comparable period of 1995.
	
<P>
This quarter’s revenue increase was primarily attributable to the significant contribution from EMCON’s Operation & Construction (EOC) Division due to the very successful integration of Organic Waste Technologies (OWT).  Specifically, OWT contributed net revenue of approximately $6 million and operating income of  $980,000; outperforming company expectations.
	
<P>
While pleased with the  performance of the EOC Division,  we were disappointed with our bottom line results and the contributions from our core Consulting and Laboratory Divisions.  As a result of significant declines in the Alaska, Washington and Southeast markets, we  continue to reduce headcount in those areas to right size operations of both divisions.  Severance and related costs associated with these reductions combined with  work delays from several key clients  also negatively impacted quarterly results.  The second quarter also saw continued erosion of margins in both the Consulting and Laboratory divisions.  We expect to continue to feel the impact from all of these factors for the remainder of the year and will continue to adjust our operations accordingly.

<P>

	Quarterly Highlights   For the past several years EMCON has focused on regaining profitability and remaking the organization as a provider of integrated environmental services to compete in today’s rapidly changing marketplace.  With the EOC Division now successfully on course,  my personal energies have now been focused on addressing the challenges faced by our core business. I have assumed the role of president of the Consulting Division.  As of June 1, we further flattened the organization of the Consulting division, streamlining four administrative levels to two, and implemented an aggressive new business development plan.

<P>
	During the quarter, we were awarded several new master service agreements (MSA) from customers across the nation.  MSAs essentially facilitate the repeated use of EMCON services and further strengthen our long-term customer relationships.  Among these, we are particularly excited about the recent MSA with Northwest Airlines, wherein EMCON was selected as the major national provider of environmental services for Northwest Airlines. All of the new MSAs are significant wins for EMCON and are expected to begin contributing to revenue and earnings in 1997.  And finally, we are very pleased to report that Columbia Analytical Services, Inc. (CAS), our Laboratory Division, was selected as one of the top two analytical laboratories in the United States and the recipient of  the Environmental Technology 1995 Readers’ Choice Award.
 
<P>

Looking Forward   The environmental services industry continues to be very challenging. However, I believe that EMCON is correctly positioned for the future -- now focusing on doing the work rather than simply designing or planning the work.  We will continue to invest in changing our business mix to answer our clients’ demands, offering our recognized expertise in engineering, operations and construction.
	
<P>
I remind readers that this report contains certain forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the continued success of our restructuring activities and the future performance of the Company.  Market trends are always subject to change, and our actual results may vary materially from our expectations.  For a complete discussion of the risks EMCON faces, please refer to our recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
	
<P>
I thank you for your interest and support and invite you to follow EMCON’s progress in the future.

<P>

Sincerely,
</blockquote><P>

<P>

To Our Stockholders:

<P>

EVT made significant progress during the third quarter and I’m pleased to review some of our accomplishments with you.  First, quarterly financial results were in line with our expectations and we were happy with the increase in revenue from product sales.
<P>
Patient enrollment in the Phase II clinical trial of our Tube EGS® system remains on track to support completion of that study by year-end.  I am happy to report that the Phase II clinical trial of our Bifurcated EGS® system has been initiated and enrollment is proceeding on schedule as well.  Both products continue to perform well in the clinic.
<P>
Recently, the company announced that the FDA approved an IDE for our third product, the Aortoiliac EGS® system.  In addition, the agency granted our request to bypass Phase I testing and proceed directly into a Phase II clinical trial, accelerating the regulatory schedule for this important product by four to six months.  The Aortoiliac EGS® system is designed to treat aneurysm anatomy that is not suitable for our tube or bifurcated implants, and could significantly broaden the patient population eligible for endovascular AAA repair.
<P>
On the international front, preparations remain on schedule for submission of a CE Mark application in the first quarter of next year.  The CE Mark approval would allow the company to market its products throughout Europe.  During the third quarter, EVT underwent a pre-CE Mark inspection of operations with good results.  All of the required implantation procedures have been performed and we are awaiting six month patient follow-up data to complete the submission.  We recently hired a vascular surgeon to manage clinical and medical affairs in Europe and continue to build our European team in preparation for a product launch targeted for next year.
<P>
		The company continues to strengthen its intellectual property position.  During the third quarter, the U.S. Patent Office allowed four important new EVT patents which should issue over the next several months.  We believe these patents will further protect our technology and cover basic methods relating to the endovascular implantation of a vascular graft prosthesis.
<P>
We are pleased that Elizabeth A. McDermott has joined the company as vice president of research and development.  Liz was formerly senior vice president of research and development at Pilkington Barnes Hind and previously held a variety of management positions with Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, now a part of Guidant Corporation.  I have known Liz for many years and have very high regard for her technical and management capabilities.  We are delighted to have Liz join the EVT management team.
<P>
Looking ahead, we have targeted completion of patient enrollment in the Phase II trial of our Tube EGS® system and initiation of Phase II clinical trials of our Aortoiliac EGS® system in the fourth quarter.  In the coming months, we intend to complete and submit the technical sections of our CE Mark application and continue making preparations for a product launch in Europe.  We will continue to focus on the important task of developing our second generation product family, which features lower profile delivery catheters and simplified implant deployment.
<P>
In conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter results and look forward to success in the fourth quarter.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Dallas, Texas, October 16, 1996…  ENSCO International Incorporated  (NYSE: ESV) announced record profits for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 1996.

<P>

	The Company reported net income of $27.2 million, or $0.38 per share, on revenues of $134.6 million for the third quarter of 1996.  This compares to net income of $16.3 million, or $0.27 per share, on revenues of $71.8 million, for the third quarter of 1995.  Net income in the third quarter of 1995 included $5.7 million, or $0.09 per share, from the Company’s discontinued technology segment, which was sold in 1995.  The Company’s 1996 third quarter results benefitted from higher day rates and improved utilization in both the offshore drilling and marine transportation segments as compared to the prior year period.  The acquisition of Dual Drilling Company, which closed in mid-June 1996, contributed to the Company’s results for the entire third quarter of this year, the first such quarterly contribution from Dual.  The Company’s 1996 third quarter income included an after-tax gain of $1.75 million ($0.02 per share) on the sale of securities originally received in connection with the Company’s disposition of its technology segment.

<P>

ENSCO’s net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $63.5 million, or $0.98 per share, on revenues of $316.4 million compared to $31.0 million, or $0.51 per share, on revenues of $195.3 million for the first nine months of 1995. Income from continuing operations, which excludes results from the technology segment in the 1995 nine month period, increased two and a half fold during the first nine months of 1996 from the comparable nine month period in 1995.  The 1996 nine month results include the contribution from the acquisition of Dual for the three and a half months since the closing of the transaction.

<P>

Operating margins in the contract drilling segment in the third quarter of 1996 improved from the year earlier period due to increased contributions from all geographic areas (North America, Europe and South America), and the addition of a fourth geographic core in Asia as the result of the Dual acquisition.  Average day rates for the Company’s jackup rigs increased by approximately $6,500 in the third quarter of 1996 compared to the year earlier period, and utilization increased to 94% from 89% year over year.  Excluding rigs in the shipyard undergoing enhancement and/or refurbishment, utilization for the Company’s 34 jackup rigs was 99% for the three months ended September 30, 1996.

<P>

Operating margins in the marine transportation segment increased in the third quarter of 1996 compared to the year earlier period due to higher day rates and utilization for the Company’s Gulf of Mexico boat fleet.  Average day rates for the Company’s 37 vessels increased by approximately $1,400 and utilization improved to 92% from 87% in the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the year earlier period.

<P>

Carl Thorne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ENSCO, commented that the Company’s record third quarter profit resulted from improving business fundamentals, contributions from four international rigs that returned to work after completing enhancements, and the addition of the Dual rig fleet in June of 1996.  "We anticipate fundamentals continuing to improve, two more rigs returning to service after completion of shipyard work in the fourth quarter, and continued focus on building our Asia business unit.  We plan to mobilize one of our Gulf of Mexico 250’ jackup rigs to the Middle East and to complete the purchase of a 300’ jackup rig, the Miss Clementine, in the fourth quarter.  Both rigs are expected to commence term contracts in early 1997 at attractive rates."

<B>THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>

	
<B>HORSHAM, PA, NOVEMBER 14, 1996</B>--EnviroSource, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENSO) today reported a third quarter net loss of 4 cents per share, consisting of 1 cent income from operations, 2 cents loss due to additional reorganization and restructuring charges, and 3 cents loss to eliminate previously recorded federal income tax benefit (due to lower expected earnings for the year).  In the 1995 quarter net income amounted to 7 cents per share.  The 1996 third quarter net loss amounted to $1.8 million as compared with net income of $3.1 million in the prior year quarter. Revenues declined to $63.4 million from $64.8 million in the 1995 quarter, due primarily to higher scrubber sludge stabilization system contract revenue in the 1995 quarter.
<P>


The net loss for the first nine months of 1996 amounted to $4.9 million or 12 cents per share, including 9 cents from unusual charges together with a gain from retiring preferred stock.  For the comparable period of the prior year, net income was $8 million or 16 cents per share, including a 1 cent unusual item credit.
<P>


Louis A. Guzzetti, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of EnviroSource, commented,  "Although conditions remain strong in the steel industry, International Mill Service's results for the quarter were lower than last year’s record quarter.  The acquisition of Alexander Mill Services in May 1996 contributed positively to third quarter results, but that contribution has not yet compensated for our loss of a major steel industry customer at about the same time.  In addition, IMS has been affected adversely by the carryover effects of a second quarter blast furnace outage at its largest customer, and by longer than usual summer outages at several mills.  Unfortunately, the employees of another important steel industry customer commenced a strike on the first day of the fourth quarter that will have a significant impact on fourth quarter results.
<P>
 

"IMSAMET’s revenues declined because of lower aluminum prices and a shift in the mix of business, but operating income was at about the same level as last year.
<P>


"Our Treatment & Disposal Services segment incurred a loss for the quarter compared to a small profit in the third quarter of 1995, because last year’s results included profit from a contract to construct a scrubber sludge stabilization system for an electric utility in the Czech Republic.   For the first time since the first quarter of 1995, we saw an increase in year-to-year treatment and disposal tonnage.  The tonnage increase resulted entirely from additional contracts to stabilize and dispose of electric arc furnace dust (a hazardous waste produced by steel mini-mills) at both our Ohio and Idaho facilities.  These contracts will significantly reduce our dependence on the unpredictable environmental cleanup market.  By year-end we expect to be processing EAF dust at a rate greater than the 150,000 ton annualized target we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year, and we expect to process more than 200,000 tons in 1997.
<P>


"All the major steps of our 1996 reorganization are now completed.  Cost savings of $2.6 million have been realized so far and savings of approximately $4 million are expected for the year.  Ongoing annual savings should approximate $5 million."
<P>

<blockquote>Note:  In 1996 $4.4 million of unusual charges relate to the Company’s 1996 reorganization and office relocations, including $.7 million in the third quarter. The reorganization has saved approximately $2.6 million so far in 1996 and a total of $4 million is expected for the year.  Ongoing annual savings should approximate $5 million.  The 1996 unusual charges also include $.9 million resulting from the first quarter settlement of the last disputed matter remaining from the Company’s 1993 restructuring, and $.3 million for related expenses in the third quarter.  The unusual charges contributed $.02 per share to the loss in the third quarter and together with the preferred stock retirement gain a net $.09 in the nine months of 1996.  The elimination of previously recorded federal income tax benefit contributed $.03 per share to the loss in the third quarter.
<P>


In 1995 the Company favorably resolved a number of liabilities resulting from its 1988 acquisition of IU International.  The benefit of these developments was partially offset by additional charges for other matters arising from that acquisition.  The net unusual credit totaled $1.2 million in the third quarter and $2 million in the nine months.  Due to disproportionate tax effects, the net credits contributed $.01 to net income per share in the nine months, but had no effect on income per share in the 1995 quarter.

The Company has discontinued sending quarterly reports to shareholders and is now sending the quarterly earnings release that is distributed to the financial community and business media instead.  This allows shareholders to receive interim information in a more timely manner and at a lower cost to the Company.

<CENTER><B>ESKIMO PIE CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</CENTER></B>
<P>

<B>Richmond, Va. ... October 17, 1996...</B> Eskimo Pie Corporation (NASDAQ NNM: EPIE) today reported consolidated sales for the third quarter of 1996 of  $16.9 million which resulted in a net loss of $2.8 million or $0.77 per share on a fully diluted basis.  The loss includes special third quarter charges of approximately $1.5 million after related tax benefits.  The net loss excluding these special charges was $1.3 million or $0.36 per share on a fully diluted basis which compares to net income of $1.3 million for the third quarter of 1995.
As a result of the third quarter results, the Company will break even for the first nine months of 1996.  Excluding the special third quarter charges, the Company would have reported nine month net income of approximately $1.5 million or $0.44 per share on a fully diluted basis.  These results compare to net income of $4.9 million for the same period in 1995.   
<P>
  	
      	Arnold H. Dreyfuss, Chairman and CEO said, "We, along with the entire ice cream industry, have had a difficult year.  The frozen novelty category is down for the most recent 52-week period with the ice cream bar segment of the category showing double digit declines according to Information Resources Inc.  After we reported a disappointing second quarter, the market's expectations for 1996 were lowered.  Our third quarter loss before the special charges is below the revised market expectations due principally to continued softening in our principal markets and the anticipated higher level of expenditures for advertising and sales promotion efforts.  The special third quarter charges include amounts relating to severance accruals resulting from a recent change in executive management, the disposal of certain equipment leased to one of our licensees, and the disposal of licensee and Company held inventories which did not sell during the quarter and appear to have no future recoverability.  These charges, other than the severance accruals, require minimal cash flows and enhance relationships with our strategic licensees."
<P>

"Looking to the future, the Company will re-focus its efforts on the  ESKIMO PIE brand while continuing to give the needed attention to the sublicensed brands we represent.  Our financial position remains strong and we have sufficient cash flows and the financial flexibility to support our ongoing business plans and strategic objectives.  We continue to believe that the strong brand names we bring to the category will allow Eskimo Pie Corporation to remain a leader in the frozen dessert category." 
<P>

Eskimo Pie Corporation, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia created the frozen novelty industry in 1921 with the invention of the <B>ESKIMO PIE</B> ice cream bar.  The Company markets a broad range of frozen novelty, frozen yogurt, ice cream and sorbet products under the <B>ESKIMO PIE, Welch's, Weight Watchers, SnackWell's, OREO and RealFruit brand names</B>.  The Company also manufactures and markets ingredients and packaging to the dairy industry.

E’town’s third quarter results illustrate the weather’s effect on earnings in our industry.  The cool, wet weather that characterized the summer and early fall of 1996 minimized the need for lawn watering and other outdoor uses of water, while the hot, dry weather of 1995 yielded record high demand.  As a result, net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $4.5 million or 58 cents per share compared to $5.2 million or 69 cents per share in 1995.
<P>

While earnings for the quarter were less than expected, we are pleased to report that our new Canal Road Treatment Plant began producing water for our customers on October 24, bringing to an end a three-year construction period and 16 years of planning. The new plant is the result of successful collaboration among our regulators, many dedicated employees, and you--our shareholders.
<P>

The completion of the plant triggered a             21 percent, or $21.8 million, rate increase, which had been approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities several months prior.  More than 96 percent of the rate increase covers the cost to construct and operate the new plant. The rates reflect a full allowance for all capital and operating costs for the plant and an authorized rate of return on common equity of 11.25 percent.
<P>

The completion of the plant and the implementation of new rates mark the end of a long period of intense capital expansion, which has depressed earned returns and required our customers to shoulder frequent rate hikes.  Anticipating the completion of this milestone in our capital program, your management has beenputting plans in place to realize the maximum value from these new assets for our customers and shareholders.  These plans focus on three critical areas -- enhancing customer service, improving productivity and increasing sales by targeting communities proximate to our existing utility systems. Now that the plant and its financing, regulatory and construction challenges are behind us, we can focus more on these three critical areas.
<P>

One example of our efforts to improve productivity is our participation with our local electric utility in a power conservation plan, which has reduced the electricity needs of the Raritan- Millstone Treatment Plant by 20 percent. The project, which cost Elizabethtown $2 million, is presently yielding an annual savings of approximately $1.3 million for Elizabethtown customers.
<P>

Our efforts to increase our customer base should be aided by recent federal tax legislation. Since 1986, monies received by investor owned utilities for main extensions were treated as taxable income. Recently, the tax was repealed, allowing investor owned water companies to cost-effectively compete with municipal systems--which were never subject to the tax--when offering services to developers.

<P>
Finally, with the reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act, we expect sound science to guide new water quality regulations going forward. The new law was developed following many years of deliberations among water suppliers, state and local officials and the environmental community. In anticipation of the reauthorization, Elizabethtown has continually improved itstreatment and testing procedures to ensure compliance with the new standards. The law requires water companies to provide customers with annual consumer confidence reports that describe the source and quality of their water.  Elizabethtown has always placed importance on communicating water quality information with its customers and will begin producing consumer  confidence reports this year, two years before the new requirement takes effect.                                                     
<P>
  In response to requests from many shareholders, E’town now offers direct deposit of quarterly dividends into your personal bank account. The service will be provided by The Bank of New York, free of charge. If you are interested in this service, please call The Bank of New York at 1-800-524-4458.

<CENTER><B>EQUUS GAMING REPORTS 1996 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>ST. CHARLES, Md.</B> --- May 16, 1996 --- Equus Gaming Company L.P. (Nasdaq: EQUUS), a publicly traded partnership with horse racing and entertainment interests in the Caribbean, today announced operating results for the three months ended March 31, 1996.  Equus owns an 82 percent interest in HDA, a partnership that owns the assets of El Comandante, TELENET and a 55 percent interest in Galapagos, S.A.
<P>

	The Company reported a net loss of $13,000 ($.00 per Unit) compared to a net loss of $81,000 ($.02 per Unit) for the same period in 1995.  Revenues were $5,835,000 in the 1996 first quarter compared to $1,237,000 in the 1995 first quarter.  The accounts of HDA were not consolidated until March 8, 1995, so on a proforma basis the net income was $145,000 ($.02 per Unit) on revenues of $4,207,000 in the 1995 first quarter.  The 1995 proforma results are presented as if Equus existed in its present form since January 1, 1995.
<P>

	Donald G. Blakeman, President of Equus, said, "We are encouraged by the results of the expanded racing program at El Comandante race track in Puerto Rico. Beginning February 1, 1996, the number of race days per week increased from four to five.  This has achieved the anticipated result of increasing wagering commissions paid to the track operator for each subsequent month.  El Comandante contributed more than $800,000 pre-tax net income to Equus in the 1996 first quarter."
<P>

	However, Mr. Blakeman said the Equus 1996 first quarter results were adversely affected by a loss of $212,000 attributable to the Company’s share of losses for Galapagos, S.A.  Galapagos has the franchise to operate V Centenario, a government-owned thoroughbred race track in the Dominican Republic that opened April 29, 1995.  Galapagos also owns the rights to develop the island’s off-track betting agency system and has the exclusive rights to simulcasting of horse races in the Dominican Republic.  Galapagos commenced simulcasting of El Comandante races into the Dominican Republic on February 27, 1995.  Mr. Blakeman said that Equus expects Galapagos to approach break even operating results for the full year 1996.
<P>

	In the 1996 first quarter, Equus announced that a subsidiary of Paxson Communications Corporation (AMEX: PXN) signed a stock purchase agreement to acquire a 50 percent interest in TELENET, a three-station television network in Puerto Rico, for $4 million.  The transaction is subject to the approval of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is expected to occur in the second or third quarter of 1996.  Meanwhile, since February 1996 Paxson has been providing programming and certain other services to TELENET under a Time Brokerage Agreement.  Following FCC approval, Paxson has agreed to assume responsibility for managing the TV operations.
<P>

	Although Equus’ share of TELENET’s 1996 first quarter losses was approximately $100,000, all of these losses were attributable to operations in January 1996 before the broadcasting and programming format was changed.
<P>

	Mr. Blakeman said, "We are looking forward to continued growth in the performance of El Comandante and the racing operations in the Dominican Republic.  The new programming format for TELENET has already improved the network’s operating results and it is positioned for a turnaround from Equus’ approximately $1 million share of 1995 TELENET losses.  Equus can look forward to growth in the periods ahead."
<P>

	Equus received a cash distribution of $246,000 from HDA based on HDA’s 1996 first quarter results, which it intends to use for Puerto Rico income taxes and corporate office expenses.  Consequently, Mr. Blakeman said that there will be no cash distribution to Unitholders related to Equus’ operations for the three months ended March 31, 1996.

<b>FAY’S REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS</b>
<p>
LIVERPOOL, N.Y....November 22, 1995...Fay’s Incorporated (NYSE Symbol: FAY), reported earnings from continuing operations for the third quarter ended October 28, 1995 were $1,328,000 or $.06 per share, compared to $2,205,000 or $.11 per share in the third quarter of last year.  Revenues for the quarter increased 3.7% to $250.2 million from $241.3 million a year earlier.  Revenues for comparable stores (stores opened one year or more as of October 28, 1995) increased 1.3% for the third quarter.

<p>	Fay’s earnings from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year were $3,049,000 or $.14 per share.  This compares to earnings from continuing operations of $5,953,000 or $.29 per share in the first nine months of last year.  Revenues for the first nine months of the year increased 5.5% to $744.8 million from $705.7 million a year earlier.  For the first nine months of the year, revenues from comparable stores increased 1.2%.

<p>	As previously reported, during the third quarter Fay’s entered into a definitive agreement to sell the inventory and store assets of its Wheels Discount Auto Supply Division to Western Auto Supply Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck and Co., for $37 million in cash.  Operating results for Wheels Discount Auto Supply Division have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations.  Prior year operating results have been restated to reflect continuing operations.  Closure of the sale of Wheels is expected during the fourth quarter.  Proceeds of the sale will be available to reduce debt and to make further investments in the Company’s drug store operations.

<p>	Henry A. Panasci, Jr., Chairman of the Board of Fay’s, stated, "The decline in earnings from continuing operations for the quarter resulted primarily from declines in gross margins earned on prescriptions sold through third party prescription plans.  Softness encountered in the sale of general and seasonal merchandise also contributed to the decline in earnings.  While progress has been made in reducing operating expenses, the reductions achieved were not sufficient to offset the combined effects of gross margin and sales shortfalls.  We remain encouraged by strong gains made in our pharmacy business, where total sales increased 9.4% on a 6% increase in the total number of prescriptions filled.  Prescription sales from comparable stores increased 6.9% on a 2.9% increase in the number of prescriptions filled.

<p>	"The pending sale of our Wheels Discount Auto Supply Division will allow us to devote all of our financial and management resources to improving the profitability of our core drug store business.  Our focus through the remainder of the year will be on attainment of further reductions in operating costs.  We are hopeful that we will be able to capitalize on improving sales trends as we enter the critical Christmas selling season."

	<p>Fay’s currently operates the 12th largest drug store chain in the United States with 276 drug stores located in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire.  Fay’s will continue to pursue the divestiture of its other non-drug store retail business, The Paper Cutter, which operates 30 stores that sell office supplies, books and greeting cards.

<BLOCKQUOTE>To Our Stockholders
<P>
	As shown below, our company experienced a loss for the first fiscal quarter due to the passage of legislation on September 30, 1996 which mandates that the Savings Association Insurance Fund be recapitalized through a special assessment on the deposits of the thrift industry.  Your company’s charge, recognized in the first quarter, will be approximately $2.0 million after tax.  Importantly, the insurance premium paid by the bank will be reduced beginning January 1, 1997 by approximately $475,000 after tax.  During the quarter, the company also recognized a charge of $340,000 after tax for the write-down of certain available for sale securities.  If not for the one-time charge and write-down of securities, the company’s earnings for the quarter would have been $1.8 million, or $.37 per share, which would have been an improvement over the first quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

	Loan demand remained strong during the quarter, with growth of  $10.4 million, while deposits declined $7.6 million, continuing the trend of fiscal 1996.

<P>

	Our ongoing attempts to control operating expenses led to the decision this past quarter to commence the process of terminating the bank’s defined-benefit retirement plan and to restructure the company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  The termination of the defined benefit plan will save the company approximately $156,000 annually, which has been reflected in the September results.  The benefit of lowered expense from the restructuring of the ESOP will be reflected when, and if, the Internal Revenue Service approves the changes.

<P>

	Finally, the quarterly dividend was increased from 15 cents to 17.5 cents per share starting with the November dividend.

<LI> Includes $28.8 million in securities which management decided to sell at September 30, 1996 resulting in a charge of $340,000 after tax, or $.07 per share representing a write-down for other-than-temporary impairment at that date.

<P>

 <LI> The net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 is due to a one-time charge of approximately $2.0 million after tax, or $.41 per share, representing a special assessment of 65.7 basis points on the bank’s deposits held as of March 31, 1995, as a result of the recently enacted legislation to recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF).  The bank expects to realize annual savings of approximately $.10 per share ($475,000 after tax, based on current deposit levels) beginning in January 1997 as a result of reduced deposit premiums following the recapitalization of the SAIF.  If not for the one-time charge or the write-down of securities, the company’s earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 would have been $1.8 million, or $.37 per share.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS</B></CENTER>

 To Our Stockholders
<P>

	As you know, I joined First Alert, Inc. as President and Chief Executive Officer in mid-September and it has been an interesting first six weeks.  One of the key factors which led me to join the company was the fundamental strength of this business: our brand equity, a broad distribution base, a strong technology base and solid market growth fundamentals.  These fundamental strengths will be the foundation of our efforts to revitalize First Alert.  We intend to be decisive and focused in the actions that we take.  Our goal is to restore and leverage First Alert’s competitive advantages in the market place.
<P>

	I would like to review the third quarter results, which are disappointing and well short of our expectations, after which I would like to share with you my initial assessment of the business and address the areas in which we must improve.
<P>

	Net income for the 1996 third quarter declined to $2.2 million, or $0.09 per share, from $8.7 million, or $0.35 per share, in the third quarter of 1995.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net loss was $8.2 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to net income of $13.5 million or $0.54 per share reported in the comparable period in 1995.
<P>

	Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 1996 were $60.9 million compared to $72.2 million recorded in the similar period a year ago.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net sales were $145.3 million compared to $169.9 million recorded in the same period in the prior year.
<P>

	The decline in sales, which was the principal factor underlying the decline in earnings in the period, is attributable to a highly competitive retail environment in the home safety category which resulted in a loss of distribution at certain accounts.
	
<P>
Gross profit in the 1996 third quarter, excluding depreciation, was $24.3 million, or 39.9% of net sales, down from $33.9 million or 47.0% of net sales in the third quarter of 1995.  For the nine month period, gross profit, excluding depreciation, was $46.2 million or 31.8% of net sales in 1996, down from $76.8 million or 45.2% of net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 1995.
	
<P>
Operating income for the fiscal 1996 third quarter was $4.7 million compared to $14.8 million in the third quarter a year ago.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, an operating loss of $10.5 million was recorded compared to operating income of $22.8 million in the similar period in 1995.
	
<P>
Many of the business strengths identified earlier that drew me to First Alert have been reconfirmed.  However, we’ve identified significant opportunities to improve our management of this business to ensure the on-going achievement of more acceptable performance.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>First, we need to be more aggressive market leaders and expand our market leadership in the home safety consumer market.  We need to reduce product costs, reposition our product offerings and add excitement to the First Alert market presence.  These initiatives are underway, focusing on significant product lines.
<LI>Second, we need to solidify our CO detector business to keep pace with the rapidly evolving consumer’s expectations for these products, as well as the impact of standard-setting agencies.  This market continues to represent a significant opportunity for us to improve our profitability.  Our actions are focused on key product features and product cost reduction.
<LI>Third, we need to upgrade our internal management processes, specifically in the areas of sales forecasting and production planning.  This will enable us to achieve the desired inventory reduction, as well as improve our overall customer service performance.
</UL>
	Key to our success on all of these initiatives is execution.  Your management team is focused on these key priorities.
<P>

	I look forward to the opportunity to improve our company’s performance and am prepared to address the issues which face the company.  I look forward to updating you in the future on our progress.

Dear Shareholder:

<P>

Effective November 6, 1996 First Citizens Financial
will change its transfer agent and registrar from
ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. 
to Registrar and Transfer Company.  Communications 
concerning change of address, lost certificates and 
transfer requirements should be directed to:

<P>

Registrar and Transfer Company<BR>
10 Commerce Drive<BR>
Cranford, New Jersey   07016-3572<BR>
1 (800) 368-5948   ext. 7760<P>

We believe this change will provide you and the Corporation with improved service.

<P>

First Citizens Financial’s strong earnings trend continued with consolidated net income for the third quarter of 1996 increasing 30% to $1.354 million or $.42 per share from $1.044 million or $.33 per share in the same quarter of 1995 before taking a charge for the special one-time assessment on SAIF deposits.  The effect of this assessment, as a result of the recent legislation enacted by Congress and imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF"), is a one-time after-tax charge of $1.859 million or $.58 per share.

<P>

This one-time charge results in a consolidated net loss for the three months ended September 30, 1996 of $505,000 or $.16 per share compared to net income of $1.044 million or $.33 per share for the three months ended September 30, 1995.  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 after the one-time charge was $1.722 million or $.54 per share, compared to $2.945 million or $.94 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 1995.  Before the one-time charge, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $3.581 million or $1.12 per share, an increase of 22% from the same period of 1995.

<B>Third Quarter Report<BR>
September 30, 1996<P>
To Our Stockholders:</B> 
<P>

At the end of September 1996, The United States Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, an appropriations bill which contained a provision for recapitalizing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) with a one-time special assessment of 65.7 basis points on deposits as of March 31, 1995. All financial institutions insured under the SAIF are required to reflect this assessment in their September 30, 1996 financial statements. The bill also reduced the annual SAIF assessment rate from 23.0 basis points to 6.4 basis points effective January 1, 1997.
<P>

This amounts to a one-time charge to First Federal Savings of $3.1 million, or $1.8 million, $0.69 per share, after taxes. We look at this one-time charge in a positive light in that it finally reduces the substantial differential in premium assessments between SAIF insured institutions and BIF insured banks and puts us on the same playing field. First Federal’s deposit insurance premiums will be reduced by about $1 million annually beginning in 1997.
<P>

Net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, including this assessment, were $238,000, or $0.09 per share, compared to $1.3 million, or $0.48 per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 1995. 
<P>

Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 were $2.9 million, or $1.08 per share, compared to $4.5 million, or $1.71 per share, for the same period a year ago.
<P>

Your Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid to stockholders of record as of October 31, 1996 and to be distributed on or about November 7, 1996.
<P>
First Federal continues to be a strong, viable, community banking institution. The fact we can absorb a large government assessment and still pay our regular, quarterly cash dividend is evidence of that. Even after the assessment, First Federal’s capital position remains well above regulatory requirements. We are glad to have the deposit insurance issue finally behind us.
<P>
In the long term, the government’s actions this year regarding bad debt reserve taxation and deposit fund capitalization should improve First Federal’s franchise value.
<P>

Thank you for your confidence in us and we look forward to a long term relationship.

<BLOCKQUOTE>  Dear Shareholder,
<P>


We hope you find this format for bringing you First Merchants Acceptance Corporation’s quarterly reports to be informative.  If you have investor questions, or wish to receive other published financial information, please call our Investor Relations line at 
(847) 267-8777.

<CENTER><B>Third Quarter 1996<BR>
Quarterly Report To Shareholders<BR>
For the three months ended September 30, 1996</B></CENTER><BR>

<P>

We are pleased to report First Merchants Acceptance Corporation’s financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Net earnings increased 97% to $3.3 million, compared to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 1995.  Net earnings per share for the quarter were up 32% to $0.49 per share on a 50% increase in weighted average shares outstanding.  Finance contracts purchased during the quarter totaled $130 million, a 121% increase over the third quarter of 1995.  Total revenues for the quarter were $26.2 million, a 147% increase over total revenues of $10.6 million in the third quarter of 1995.  The increase in revenues primarily reflects a 69% increase in interest income earned on finance contracts and a gain on sale of finance receivables.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, total revenues increased significantly to $71.6 million, up from $25.6 million in the first nine months of 1995.  Net earnings for the 1996 nine-month period totaled $9.5 million, or $1.41 per share, as compared to $4.2 million, or $0.94 per share for the prior year period.

<P>

Serviced Receivables Increased During The Quarter.  First Merchants surpassed one-half billion dollars in serviced finance receivables during the third quarter.  Average finance receivables serviced during the quarter were $527 million, up significantly from $185 million in the year-ago quarter.  We are especially proud to have achieved this milestone in just over five years of operations.

<P>

Moving To Become A Low Cost Provider Using Hub And Spoke Strategy. The third quarter of 1996 was the Company’s first complete quarter operating under our expanding hub and spoke strategy, and we believe the quarter’s results reflect its success.  The hub and spoke strategy serves dealers through local market sales representatives supported by regional dealer service centers.  These operations are less expensive than a branch based model, but maintain superior, personalized service to dealers.  Our operating expense ratios have improved since we expanded the program nationwide. During the quarter, our dealer network expanded to include 37 states and a presence in 80% of the top 50 metropolitan markets in the country.

<P>

Credit Quality Trends In Line With Our Expectations And Reserves Increased.  Net charge-offs as a percentage of average serviced finance receivables were 5.8%, unchanged from the second quarter of 1996.  At the quarter end, total accounts 31 or more days past due were 3.4% of serviced finance receivables compared to 3.2% at the end of the second quarter of 1996. These results were in line with our expectations.  Total credit loss reserves, including the allowance for credit losses and reserves attributable to contracts sold or held for sale, increased to 7.6% of serviced finance receivables compared with 7.0% of serviced receivables at the end of the second quarter of 1996. 

<P>

First Public Securitization Completed.  First Merchants completed a $117.5 million asset securitization through the sale of auto receivables-backed Notes and Certificates.  This securitization was our first public asset-backed receivable transaction, and represents the first take-down on the Company’s recent shelf registration for up to $625 million of asset-backed securities which was filed with the SEC early in the quarter.  Utilizing the public market for our receivables securitizations allows us access to an expanded universe of investors, and an opportunity to improve the execution of our securitizations.  Since the completion of our first securitization in November 1995, First Merchants has completed five asset-backed transactions totaling $470 million.

<P>

Duff & Phelps Debt Rating Received.  First Merchants received an initial implied senior unsecured debt rating of "BB+" from Duff & Phelps, a leading credit rating agency.  In developing its rating of First Merchants, Duff & Phelps cited the Company’s conservative underwriting criteria, consistent historical static pool loss performance and conservative capital structure. 

<P>

$51.8 Million In Subordinated Debt Issued.  Subsequent to the quarter end, the Company issued approximately $51.8 million of 9.5% Subordinated Reset Notes due December 15, 2006.  The Reset Notes feature a fixed interest rate for the first five years.  The rate of interest thereafter can be reset at the Company’s option for periods of one, two, three or five years until maturity.  The Notes are redeemable at the option of the holder or the Company at each time that the interest rate may be reset and are rated "BB" by Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Co.  

<P>

Strategic Relations Group Created To Pursue Strategic Alliances.    We recently created a Strategic Relations Group to develop cooperative arrangements with a variety of banks and other lending institutions, that would refer non-prime automobile lending business to the Company.  One such alliance was established with Magna Bank.  We are optimistic about the establishment of additional strategic relationships through the efforts of this new group.

<P>

The recent quarter’s results and our previously announced stock repurchase program reflect our commitment to building value for our shareholders.  Our achievements are due to the strength of our infrastructure and our ability to take advantage of the many opportunities for growth available to us.  We are pleased that three firms, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., The Chicago Corporation and Smith Barney, Inc., initiated research coverage of our stock.  The continued efforts and dedication of our employees and your interest and support are most gratifying.  I look forward to updating you in our annual report to stockholders.

Sincerely,

1996 THIRD QUARTER REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS<P></B></CENTER>

<P>

DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
<P>
Income from operations was $1.0 million, or $.06 per share, in the third quarter of 1996, up $700,000 or $.04 per share, comparedto $0.3 million, or $.02 per share, for the same quarter of 1995.
<P>
This increase, an improvement of approximately 200% for comparable year-to-year periods in 1996 versus 1995, is primarily attributable to the revenue flow from the Trust’s success in leasing previously vacant square feet, maintaining stringent cost controls, and selling three office buildings that were expensive to operate relative to their market rental rate structure. Consequently, even though the Trust sold three properties in the intervening year, leasing revenues were virtually unchanged from the year-earlier period and property operating expenses showed a significant decline. Interest and depreciation and amortization costs were slightly higher, but these increases were more than offset by the decrease in general and administrative expenses due to the absence of litigation and proxy expenses that were incurred during 1995.	
<P>
Funds from operations were $4.1 million, or $.24 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 1996, compared to $3.3 million or $.18 per share, for the same quarter of the prior year. This is an increase on a per share basis of 33%.
<P>
<B>Marathon Acquisition</B>
<P>
  On the last day of the quarter, we completed the $312 million acquisition of Marathon US Realties’ portfolio of nine shopping malls located in the southwestern United States. As a result of this acquisition, one of the largest real estate transactions by a REIT this year, First Union now has assets under management exceeding $800 million and becomes one of the leading REIT specialists in repositioning properties. The Marathon properties were acquired in a joint venture with affiliates of GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation and Cargill Financial Services Corporation. First Union’s investment totaled $30 million, financed through a combination of internally generated funds and its recently expanded $96 million credit facility. All properties will be managed by our affiliated management company, First Union Management, Inc. Additionally, First Union has the right to acquire the interests of its partners after the first six months.We estimate that First Union’s share of profits from the joint venture’s operations will result in $.08 to $.10 per share in additional funds from operations in the next 12 months.

<P><OL>
<LI>In 1995, the Trust changed its accounting method to directly expense internal leasing costs and recorded a $4.3 million charge for the cumulative effect of the accounting change. Previously, the Trust deferred and amortized these costs over the lives of consummated lease transactions. Depreciation and amortization, general and administrative expenses, earnings, earnings per share and funds from operations for 1995 have been restated to reflect the change in accounting method.

<LI>In February 1996, the Trust sold two office buildings in Cleveland, Ohio for $1.8 million in cash and a $7 million mortgage note resulting in a loss of $5.6 million. This loss had been previously recognized during the fourth quarter of 1995. In January 1995, the Trust sold its 50% interests in two malls resulting in a capital gain of approximately $29.9 million which was treated as a tax-free exchange for tax purposes.	

<LI>The amount of funds from operations is calculated as income before capital gains and cumulative effect of accounting change plus noncash charges for depreciation and amortization.

<P>
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 1996, revenues were $587.8 million, a 16% increase over the $507.6 million in 1995.  Net income rose to $45.6 million, a 26% increase over the $36.3 million in 1995.  Net income per share for the 1996 nine-month period based on 46,094,000 shares outstanding was $0.99 per share compared to $0.84 on 43,395,000 shares in 1995.
	
<P>
Fiserv continues its strong growth for the year, as reflected by our record third quarter earnings figures.  Our Company has shown consistent earnings growth since we went public in 1986.  We believe this success is a direct result of the clear commitment of our people to providing the highest quality client service available in the industry.
<P>

	This commitment to client service also has led to increased sales.  During the first nine months of 1996 our internal growth has continued at a record pace, with year-to-date new client and cross-sales 27% ahead of the same period in 1995.  In addition, the pipeline for adding new clients and expanding existing relationships remains extremely active.
<P>

	As always, we remain appreciative of your support and the confidence you have placed in us.

<P>

Flagstar Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLST) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, which included strong operating profit improvement at Hardee's, Denny's and El Pollo Loco, offset by weak performance at Quincy's.  The company reported revenue of $704 million for the third quarter, compared with $677 million in the same period last year.  The revenue increase was due to a full quarter of operating contribution from the Coco's and Carrows restaurant brands which were acquired on May 23, 1996.  The increase was offset in part by the September 1995 sale of Denny's distribution business, Proficient Food Company, fewer company-operated restaurants versus the prior year and lower comparable store sales at Hardee's and Quincy's.  Operating income was $48.3 million, versus $56.3 million in the prior year quarter.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the quarter were $81.9 million, compared with $89.1 million in the same period last year.  Overall income results for the third quarter of 1996 were principally impacted by lower comparable store sales at Quincy's and lower gains on the sale of restaurants to franchisees versus the same period last year.  Results for the quarter include income of $0.9 million from gains on the sale of restaurants to franchisees, compared with $11.8 million in the prior year quarter.  Operating income was also lower due to the sale of Denny's distribution business, but was offset by the operating contribution from Coco's and Carrows.  The company recorded a third quarter loss from continuing operations of $12.5 million, or $0.38 per share, compared with $2.8 million, or $0.15 per share, in the same period last year.

<P>

"We are pleased that Hardee's, Denny's and El Pollo Loco reported strong growth in operating income and cash flow, exclusive of gains on sale of restaurants to franchisees," said James B. Adamson, chairman and chief executive officer of Flagstar.  "From an overall standpoint, we have moved closer to closing the gap with last year's profit performance than in the first half of the year.  We have made meaningful progress in addressing Hardee's profit performance through improvements in operating efficiencies and cost control, despite a continuing sluggish sales environment.  We believe that quality and service attributes have also improved under our new Hardee's leadership, although these initiatives will take time to begin driving sales increases."

<P>

"Denny's continued to show comparable store sales growth, but more importantly, Denny's restaurant profit margins improved during the quarter," continued Adamson.  "El Pollo Loco showed particularly strong growth in comparable store sales and restaurant profitability in the period.  Quincy's performance was disappointing due to continued sales declines.  However, during the quarter, the new Quincy's management team continued to control costs while preparing initiatives to improve service basics, food quality and marketing effectiveness.  In early October, these initiatives were implemented as a first step in repositioning the Quincy's brand.  While it is too early to draw conclusions, we are encouraged that the sales declines have moderated.  Coco's and Carrows met our expectations for profit contribution for their first full quarter as part of Flagstar and we continue to work to fine tune the positioning of those brands through improvements to their menus and marketing effectiveness."

<P>

Denny's third quarter restaurant operating income, excluding gains on the sale of restaurants to franchisees, increased 21 percent to $32.8 million, from $27.0 million in the same period last year.  Denny's company-owned comparable store sales increased 0.9 percent versus the prior year quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarterly increase.  Hardee's third quarter operating income increased 56 percent to $12.1 million, from $7.8 million in the same period last year.  The increase in operating income was due to significant management focus on achieving improvement in profitability flow-through.  Hardee's comparable store sales declined 6.1 percent versus the prior year quarter.  Due to continued competitive pressures in the family steakhouse segment and reduced advertising in preparation for a major brand re-launch program, Quincy's third quarter comparable store sales declined 17.5 percent versus the prior year quarter.  As a result of the declining sales, Quincy's operating income decreased to $0.8 million during the quarter, compared with $6.7 million in the same period last year.  El Pollo Loco's comparable store sales increased 6.7 percent versus the prior year quarter, marking the tenth consecutive quarterly increase.  Operating income, excluding gains on the sale of restaurants to franchisees, increased 34 percent to $3.3 million during the quarter, from $2.5 million in the same period last year.  Sales and operating income increases were attributable to new products and large chicken meal promotions.  FRD Acquisition Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Flagstar Corporation and newly formed holding company for Coco's and Carrows, contributed a full quarter of operating results for the third quarter of 1996.  Coco's and Carrows contributed operating income of $3.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the quarter.  Coco's comparable store sales declined 3.3 percent during the quarter, while Carrows comparable store sales decreased 4.1 percent.

<P>

Flagstar is one of the nation's largest restaurant companies with over 3,200 moderately-priced restaurants and annual revenue of approximately $3 billion.  Flagstar owns and operates the Carrows, Coco's, Denny's, El Pollo Loco and Quincy's Family Steakhouse restaurant brands and is the largest franchisee of Hardee's. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>  <B>To Our Shareholders:</B>

<P>

<I>Financial Results</I>

<P>

For the third quarter, Foamex’s financial and operational performance from continuing operations continued to improve, a reflection of greater demand for our products as well as the success of our foam operations profit improvement plan.

<P>

Net sales from continuing operations for the quarter ended September 29, 1996 were $236.8 million, 9.1%  higher than last year.  Net income from continuing operations rose to $7.4 million, or $0.29 per share, from $1.0 million, or $0.04 per share, in the 1995 third quarter. 

<P>

These results exclude a loss for discontinued operations of $73.6 million related primarily to the sale of JPS Automotive, our automotive carpet, trim and textiles subsidiary.  In August, we announced the sale of JPS Automotive to Collins & Aikman, a major supplier to the North American automotive industry, and we currently expect the transaction to close by year-end. 

<P>

The increase in net sales was primarily due to stronger demand for all of our core products: cushioning foams, carpet cushion, automotive foams and technical foams.  Additional factors contributing to our strong earnings performance were margin improvement, savings resulting from our operational improvements, and the stabilization of raw material costs.

<P>

For the first nine months ended September 29, 1996, net sales from continuing operations rose to $696.3 million from $651.9 million in 1995, a 6.8% increase.  Income from continuing operations rose to $19.8 million from $6.4 million.  Earnings per share was $0.77 versus $0.24 in the comparable 1995 period.  These results also exclude a $111.6 million loss for discontinued operations.  
 
<P>

<I>Debt Reduction 
</I>
<P>

We have taken several steps to strengthen our capital structure. The proceeds from the Perfect Fit and JPS Automotive sales are earmarked to be used to reduce long-term debt, which was $497.2 million at the end of the third  quarter.  With the proceeds from the sale of Perfect Fit, we have repaid $12.0 million of bank term loan borrowings and made an offer to redeem up to $29.8 million of Foamex L.P.’s outstanding public debt.
 
<P>

<I>Foam Operations Profit Improvement Plan</I>   

<P>

Our foam operations profit improvement plan remains a high priority and has resulted in anticipated savings.  The continued progress we are experiencing puts us on track to achieve $30 million in savings in 1996 and cumulative savings of $50 million in 1997.      

<P>

<I>Expanding Our Core Polyurethane Business</I>

<P>

We believe that the line of advanced polymer products enabled by VPF™ technology represents a promising area of growth for Foamex, as do selected opportunities to introduce our products to more markets outside of North America.  During the quarter, we announced the creation of a new division, Foamex Asia, to focus exclusively on that area and added a highly experienced executive to head the effort.  We also moved forward on achieving QS-9000 and ISO-9001 certifications for our facilities, an important competitive advantage.

<P>

We continue to be proud of the ongoing efforts taken by Foamex employees at all levels to improve our overall profitability.  Today, Foamex is operating more efficiently than it has in recent history.  We intend to continue to seek operational improvements while pursuing the exciting opportunities to introduce new, value-added products and expand into new geographic markets.

<P>

Sincerely,

Earnings per share were $1.09 per share for the first 40 weeks of 1996 based on 28,335,000 shares outstanding, compared with $.40 for the prior year’s first 40 weeks based on 28,373,000 shares outstanding.	
<P>
Robert G. Miller, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with our third quarter and first 40-weeks sales and net income results. Improved sales and operating earnings in our nonfood categories, partially due to strong fall apparel sales, combined with increased service levels store-wide and continued strong food sales, resulted in this year’s significant net income growth. Our continuing efforts to improve the performance of several key specialty segments of the business, including apparel, home electronics, and home improvement, showed excellent results during the quarter, primarily due to our efforts to better match product selection to the needs of our customers.	
<P>
“Gross margins as a percent of sales increased primarily due to lower markdowns, the improved sales mix in nonfood products, the impact on margins of two multistore jewelry acquisitions, lower distribution center and delivery costs as a percent of sales, low inflation, and improved plant profits. Expenses as a percent of sales for 1996 were basically flat with 1995’s results. Expenses that increased were due to the company’s commitment to improved customer service through added sales staffing at store level and the impact on expenses of the two jewelry acquisitions, offset by lower costs associated with new stores and closures that affected last year’s third quarter results, and lower 1996 advertising and corporate overhead expenses as a percent of sales. Third quarter 1996 expenses were also higher due to the early completion of holiday merchandising and costs associated with rolling out a new Sensormatic store security system.	
<P>
“Interest expense decreased to $8.3 million in 1996’s third quarter from the $9.1 million reported in last year’s third quarter. The decrease primarily reflects lower borrowings due to the impact of the company’s recently completed $108 million sale-leaseback of 10 stores and to improved cash flow from operations, offset in part by the repurchase of $70 million of common stock from FMI Associates, an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P.
<P>
	On December 2, 1996 the company was notified by KKR Associates, the general partner of FMI Associates, of its intent to dissolve FMI Associates on December 31, 1996. Following dissolution the partnership will sell up to approximately 260,000 shares of its stock in the open market in early 1997. The partnership will distribute the balance of the shares to its partners, including approximately 3,650,000 shares to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and approximately 580,000 shares to KKR Associates. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which had requested that the partnership distribute rather than sell its interests, will own approximately 14 percent of the company’s outstanding shares following the partnership’s dissolution. The company has also been advised that effective January 1, 1997, Michael Michelson, Paul Raether, and Saul Fox will resign from the company’s board of directors.
<P>
	“We completed our expansion plan for 1996 in the third quarter with the opening of a new multidepartment store in Scappoose, Oregon, and two remodels in Tacoma, Washington. During 1996 we opened five multidepartment stores, acquired two food stores from competitors that were converted into a smaller multidepartment store concept referred to as a marketplace store, and completed four major remodels. In 1997 we plan on opening five new multidepartment stores, one of which is a replacement for a nonfood store, and will remodel five stores, including the conversion of one nonfood store to include a full-service food department.	
<P>
“In addition to these openings, we have now completed the integration of two acquisitions of mall jewelry stores into our overall jewelry operations. In the first quarter we acquired 22 mall jewelry stores, located primarily in California, which are now operated under the Fred Meyer or Merksamer Jewelers names. In the second quarter, we acquired 49 Merksamer jewelry stores located in 11 states. These stores continue to use the Merksamer name. These two acquisitions now give Fred Meyer 203 jewelry stores, including 98 inside our multidepartment stores,” Miller said.	
<P>
Fred Meyer, Inc., headquartered in Portland, Oregon, is a leading regional retailer of a wide range of general merchandise, food, apparel, fine jewelry, and home improvement products. The company currently operates 219 stores, of which 109 are large multidepartment stores (101 with food departments) operating in Oregon, Washington, Utah, Alaska, Idaho, and Montana; and the balance are smaller specialty stores (including 105 jewelry stores in malls). Fred Meyer employs approximately 28,000 people, and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

<B>Third Quarter Results</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="bluehous.gif" align=right>The Company will report a third quarter 1996 loss of $475,018 ($0.24 per share) compared to net income of $26,186 ($0.02 per share) for the corresponding quarter of 1995. The year-to-date 1996 loss increased to $1,117,314 ($0.68 per share) compared to a loss of $88,303 ($0.07) for the first nine months of 1995.  The per share calculations were affected by an increase in the number of shares outstanding as the result of the Company’s initial public offering in March of 1996. The loss reflects planned increases in overhead expenses associated with expanding sales and management staffing, production of new marketing materials, the increased professional fees, insurance and other costs associated with being a public company and higher production costs associated with a contract brewing arrangement with a non-owned brewery (which was terminated as of September 30); as well as an expense associated with adjusting certain accounts payable cut-offs and a below-cost sale of dated and returned beer to a liquidator in Nevada.   
<P>
Gross revenues for the quarter were $506,450, an increase of 3.8% over the $492,445 recorded in the third quarter of 1995 on shipments of 2998 barrels, a 10.5% increase over 1995 shipments of 2713 barrels.  Gross revenues for the first nine months of 1996 were $1,375,302, an increase of 2.1% over the $1,346,644 in the same period in 1995, on shipments of 7,975 barrels, an increase of 4.9% over 1995 sales of 7,603 barrels.  Shipments continue to be constrained by the lack of production capacity — finished goods inventories at September 30 were 461 barrels, about 14 days’ shipments, down from 1085 barrels at June 30, 1996, indicating that the Company was selling all the beer it was capable of producing in its current facilities.  Depletions (sales by the Company’s wholesale distributors) in the core markets of Maryland and Washington, DC increased by nearly 15% over the same period in 1995, reflecting the Company’s success in increasing market share in its core market, while sales to several markets, including Chicago and New Jersey, were suspended to allow the Company to meet increased demand in its core markets and in preparation for alligning its distribution with stronger wholesalers when the Company’s new brewery comes on line.   
<P>
<CENTER><B>New Brewery Equipment<BR>
Begins to Arrive,<BR>
Construction Proceeds<P></B></CENTER>


The first of about 25 truckloads of new brewery equipment began to arrive at the Company’s new brewery in September.  The remaining new equipment is scheduled to arrive by December 10th.  Installation of the equipment should  be complete by December 31st.  Barring unforeseen problems, management anticipates shipping up to 1,000 barrels of beer from the new brewery by the end of January.  The Company’s offices will move to the new facility during February.  Extremely wet spring and summer weather delayed building construction by six to eight weeks.  The building is now under roof, however, and further weather-related delays should not be significant. The newbrewery expands the Company’s production capacity by 500%, provides efficient office and meeting space and features an attractive tap room where wholesalers, retailers and consumers can meet and sample Blue Ridge beers.   
<P>
 In a related development, the Board of Directors has decided to close the existing brewery in downtown Frederick as soon as practicable after the new brewery is operational, in order to permit the Company’s employees to focus on the start-up of the new brewery and because production costs at the new brewery are expected to be much lower than at the current brewery.  The existing equipment will be sold for cash, but the Company will take a significant fourth quarter charge, reflecting the write-off of undepreciated leasehold improvements and equipment.

<B>Dear Fellow Shareholders;	</B>
<P>
Greetings from the brewery!  This is the first of our quarterly reports to shareholders.  We hope you find it useful.  We apologize that we have not been communicating with you in a systematic way and pledge to do better from now on.  If you ever need more information, please do not hesitate to contact Kevin Brannon at (301) 694-7899.  We are also building a site on the World Wide Web where you can also communicate with us electronically.  Look for us at <A HREF="http://www.fredbrew.com">www.fredbrew.com</A>.
<P>
	In the past several months, the market environment in the craftbrew segment has begun to change dramatically.  As expected in a market segment growing at 40-50% per year, competition is increasing.  This competition is coming from the larger craftbrewers who recently went public, dozens of new start-ups and the mega-brewers whose market share is being taken by the craftbrewers.  We are seeing signs that competitors with inefficient breweries, inconsistent product and inadequate marketing support are losing wholesale distribution and retail shelf space.  We believe, with our efficient new brewery, experienced and well-trained brewers and aggressive market support, that Frederick Brewing Co. and our Blue Ridge brand are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and grow at a rapid rate.  
<P>
<B>Advertising, Marketing and Sales Campaigns Moving into High Gear</B>
<P>
	CEO Kevin Brannon, President Marjorie McGinnis and Sales Manager Patrick Helsel hosted a Blue Ridge hospitality suite for wholesale beer distributors on two nights at the National Beer Wholesalers’ Association convention in San Francisco in September.  They met with 20 distributors from 13 states where the Company intends to establish new distribution during 1997.  We are now following up to establish formal relationships with new wholesalers in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia with the goal to have state-wide distribution in those markets by mid-January.  We intend to establish new distribution in 29 additional states by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 1997. We are interviewing candidates to fill seven new outside sales positions by January and six more positions, for a total of 21, by the fourth quarter of 1997 in order to provide sales support in the new markets.	
<P>
We have also retained a Baltimore advertising agency, Gray Kirk Van Sant, to develop the first direct-to-consumer advertising campaign for “Blue Ridge.”  Gray Kirk has designed and implemented successful campaigns for numerous other consumer products and services companies.  A test of the campaign, whose theme is “Beer With A Conscience” will begin with radio (WJFK, WHFS and WIYY), billboards, Metro car cards and print in November and December in both the Baltimore and Washington, DC markets.  
<P>
	We have retained a market research firm to conduct brand awareness surveys before and after the initial flight of ads to measure their impact on target consumers.  If the campaign succeeds, it will be expanded into 11-13 other metro markets during 1997, with the next flight of ads beginning late in the first quarter of 1997.  Together with our increased sales force, imaginative new merchandising display items and wholesaler and retailer incentive programs, these efforts will give Blue Ridge a level of sales support matched by few craftbrews in our markets.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><HR><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Media Focus on Craftbrews Highlights the Company’s Strengths
<P></B>
	A batch of media reports and a marketing offensive by Anheuser-Busch have recently put craftbrews in the spotlight.  At first blush, this focus seems to be negative but is, in fact, good news for the Company.  In October, NBC’s “Dateline” aired a segment critical of contract brewers in general and devastating to Boston Beer Co. (“Samuel Adams”) in particular.  A-B has recently begun broadcasting ads directly confronting Boston Beer and its CEO,  Jim Koch.  In both cases, the criticism is that the contract brewers (which include “Pete’s Wicked”) are deceiving consumers by pretending to be genuine craftbrewers while, in fact, they are marketers of brands produced by second and third tier breweries like Stroh’s, Genessee and Pittsburgh Brewing.  This is obviously good for Blue Ridge, in that we do operate our own brewery and make our own beer.
<P>
	As Barron’s reported in its October 28 issue,  A-B is pressuring its distributors to drop all brands not supported by A-B.  Most A-B distributors say they will not go along with A-B’s program because A-B lacks new products to replace the high-margin craftbrews and imports A-B wants the distributors to give up. Under most states’ beer franchise law the independent wholesalers have strong legal protection against A-B’s position. In any event, only five of our distributors sell A-B products and they account for a small part of our sales.  In some markets it could be good news for Blue Ridge if A-B distributors, who usually control 50% of the market, were limited to offering only “Red Hook” in the craftbrew segment.      
<P>
	A-B is also heavily marketing the fact that it now freshness dates its beer.  As our consumers know, we have been freshness dating since our inception three years ago.	
<P>
Finally, several of the larger public craftbrewers have been reporting slower than expected sales growth.  For example Boston Beer reported that October/November orders were up only 5.5% over last year.  Red Hook, Pyramid and Pete’s also reported slower growth.  Nevertheless, Barron’s reported, overall craftbrew sales should increase 40% in 1996 and more than double again over the next few years.  This indicates that the larger companies do not have a lock on the market, leaving plenty of room for aggressive smaller brewers, like ourselves, to grow.   Winter Seasonal Products a Hit with the Trade	
<P>
We have successfully pre-sold two seasonal products and will begin shipping them in the first week of November.  The first, “Snowball’s Chance Winter Ale,” debuted in the brewery tasting room in late October.  It is a dark brown, strong (appx. 6% alcohol by volume) ale with a malty, nutty flavor.  The second seasonal product is our “Blue Ridge Mug Box” featuring five different beers, including Snowball’s Chance, a Blue Ridge pint glass and a company brochure in our patented mug-shaped box, decorated with pictures of our brewers at work.  A great gift idea, the Mug Box has a suggested retail price of $9.99.  After a sales presentation showing the promotional  four-foot snowman, unique snowman tap handle and “screaming snowball” displays, our Maryland/DC distributor pre-sold its entire allotment of both products in one week.  Early pre-sales in Virginia have also been promising.  Experience indicates that displays and sales of these high-margin products should also stimulate sales of of our regular product line.  		
<P>
	Again, we welcome your feedback on the format of this report and any questions or comments you may have.  Thank you for your support of Frederick Brewing Co.

<B>REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS</B></CENTER>

<P>

 Dear Shareholder:

<P>

Garden Botanika’s second quarter was high-lighted by the opening of 24 new stores, the introduction of our Transparencies line of fra-grance and bath products, continued expansion of our catalog business, completion of the relo-cation of our warehouse, and by the introduc-tion of Garden Botanika products as the in-room amenities in Westin Hotels & Resorts.  While we achieved record sales, significantly higher expenses associated with our growth produced a larger net loss than last year but in line with expectations.  In continuing our growth strategy and in preparation for the holiday season, we expect our third quarter losses will also exceed the losses incurred in the third quarter of 1995.

<P>

<CENTER><B>SALES INCREASE WITH <BR>
STORE EXPANSION</B></CENTER>

<P>

Sales rose 67 percent to $16.9 million from $10.1 million in the same 1995 quarter.  The 82 new stores opened since the same 1995 quarter contributed the majority of the in-crease, accounting for $5.2 million of the im-provement.  Catalog sales of $1.4 million were up significantly -- by $916,000 or 175 percent, primarily due to increased circulation.  Same store sales in locations open for 12 full months were up 2 percent, but the gain was lower than we had expected.

<P>

The effect of the slower rate of same store sales growth than in the year ago quarter was partially offset by a 2.5 percent decline in gen-eral and administrative expense as a percent of sales.  This decrease reflects improved expense leverage on a larger sales base.

<P>

Operating expenses related to Garden Botanika’s growth strategy of adding stores, expanding our product line and supporting de-velopment of the catalog business nearly dou-bled during the quarter to $6.8 million from $3.5 million.  The net effect of all these fac-tors was a net loss of $2.0 million, or $.31 per share ($.18 per share on a fully taxed basis) on 75 percent more common shares outstanding, compared to a loss of $0.8 million, or $.23 per share ($.14 per share on a fully taxed basis) a year ago.

<P>

<CENTER><B>NEW STORES EXTEND <BR>
GARDEN BOTANIKA MARKET REACH; OPENING COSTS DECLINE 
</B></CENTER>
<P>

During the quarter, 24 new stores were opened, bringing the total number of stores to 186 compared to 104 at the same time last year.  In the first half of the current fiscal year 34 new stores have been opened as part of our plan to expand by approximately 100 stores this year.  Sales in these new stores have exceeded our plans.

<P>

The majority of our new stores are located in existing markets, which allows for increased sales penetration in these areas.  Additionally, several new states have been added to our retail system -- Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah.  With these additions, Garden Botanika now has retail outlets in 37 states -- up from 29 at the start of fiscal 1996.


<P>



While expenses to open new stores were higher overall than a year ago due to the greater num-ber of openings, the average cost to open a Garden Botanika store is expected to decline during 1996, reflecting, in part, a move to bring lease acquisition and store design functions in house as well as higher levels of landlord sup-port.  In fiscal 1995, the average cost of opening a new store was $267,000.  The cost of opening stores of our current prototype during fiscal 1996 is expected to average ap-proximately $240,000.

<P>

<CENTER><B>NEW PRODUCTS BROADEN<BR> 
CUSTOMER APPEAL
</B></CENTER>
<P>

In addition to opening new stores, a key ingre-dient of our growth strategy is to build the Gar-den Botanika brand with new product offerings.

<P>

A new line of fragrance and bath products -- Transparencies -- was launched in June and customer acceptance has been high.  It is the third new product inaugurated in fiscal 1996, joining Garden Botanika the Fragrance and Botanika for Men.  While we are disappointed that the individual successes of these lines have not had a greater impact on total sales, we continue to believe that these and other new products are a key to our future growth.

<P>

The introduction of new products continues.  We are currently in the process of introducing Prefix, an innovative line of cosmetics used to fix imperfections before applying make up, into Garden Botanika stores.  The Prefix line consists of eight types of products, each for-mulated to correct common problems such as skin discoloration, rough lips and thin lashes.  This important new category capitalizes on the trend to "fix up before you make up."

<P>

<CENTER><B>COLOR STUDIOS EMPHASIZE<BR> 
COMMITMENT TO COSMETICS</B></CENTER>

<P>

Garden Botanika’s first two Color Studio stores -- a store-within-a-store dedicated to cosmetics -- are now open at the Company’s Paramus, New Jersey and Littleton, Colorado locations.

<P>

Natural Color Cosmetics are an important and growing part of our business and this new store concept allows us to dramatically expand the assortment and presentation of this important category.  Color Studio stores average 400 to 500 square feet larger than normal Garden Botanika stores.  This new emphasis allows product offerings to increase by approximately 60 percent and features specially trained color consultants.  We are enthusiastic about the potential of this design and plan to test numer-ous other Color Studio stores during the re-mainder of 1996.

<P>

<CENTER><B>EXPANSION PLAN ON TARGET</B></CENTER>

<P>

We are pleased with the progress made during the second quarter on our plan to aggressively grow Garden Botanika.  We recently opened our 200th store, a major milestone, and our schedule to open 100 new stores in fiscal 1996 is on track.  To support this growth we success-fully completed our move to a new, larger dis-tribution center, and are close to  com-


<P>

pleting major upgrades to our manufacturing and warehouse management computer systems.  Our efforts will continue at a brisk pace in the second half of the year, and we are well on our way to our goal of having over 250 Garden Botanika stores open by the end of our fiscal year.  Our strengthened balance sheet, as a result of our initial public offering in May and no debt, positions us to pursue this growth op-portunity.

<P>

At the same time, comparable store sales per-formance in the quarter was disappointing and we are focusing considerable attention on im-proving this measure.  We continue to believe that the introduction of new products is a key ingredient of our future success, and will con-tinue to devote major resources to that effort.  We also continue to review and improve our marketing and promotional plans, and we are developing improved catalog mailing strategies to support our new stores, especially those located in less developed markets.  

<P>

We have accomplished a great deal in the first half of fiscal 1996, but much remains to be done.  We appreciate the ongoing support of our employees, customers and shareholders as we move ahead.

<P>

Sincerely,
<P>

<U><B>GATX ANNOUNCES <BR>
SECOND  QUARTER & SIX MONTH  RESULTS<BR></B></U>
<P>

		CHICAGO, July 23, 1996 --GATX Corporation (NYSE:GMT) today reported earnings for the second quarter of $25.7 million or $1.09 per common share.  This compares to 1995 second quarter earnings of $29.9 million or $1.31 per common share.  On a fully diluted basis, GATX reported earnings per share of $1.05 compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $1.23 last year.  Gross income (revenues) for the second quarter increased to $338 million compared to $317 million for the year ago period.
<P>

	For the first six months of 1996, GATX reported earnings of $50.4 million or $2.14 per common share.  This compares to 1995 first half earnings of $55.6 million or $2.42 per common share.  On a fully diluted basis, GATX reported earnings per share of $2.06 compared to fully diluted earnings per share of $2.29 for the first six months of last year.  Gross income for the first six months was $641 million compared to $608 million a year ago.
	
<P>
Ronald H. Zech, chairman and chief executive officer, stated, "The year-ago quarter was GATX's record quarter and most of GATX's operating companies are down from that very high level.  This year's second quarter is a strong quarter, and GATX remains on target to achieve our third consecutive record year.  General American Transportation has approximately 4,500 additional railcars on lease compared to a year ago, and continues to enjoy high utilization levels.  GATX Capital is generating strong results and is experiencing excellent transaction volume.  American Steamship was hampered by ice and adverse weather at the beginning of the second quarter, but is experiencing strong demand for its services.  GATX Logistics continues to add profitable business by expanding its customer-share of existing contracts and adding new contracts.
	
<P>
"The quarter's lower earnings reflect utilization and pricing pressure at certain GATX Terminals' locations.  Petroleum inventories are at very low levels, and there is less demand for storage space in certain markets.  We have instituted an aggressive program to assess the changing marketplace, protect our market share, and reduce costs. 
	
<P>
"We are looking forward to a strong second half of 1996.  On a longer term basis, we have substantial opportunities to expand in three areas: 1) by growing our existing businesses; 2) by combining these businesses into new product offerings; and 3) through international expansion," Zech concluded.
	Total cash generated from operations and portfolio proceeds was $111 million compared to $163 million for the same quarter last year.  Year-to-date, cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds was $238 million compared to $241 million in 1995.  The decline in cash flow in the quarter is due to the lower level of proceeds from the sale of leased equipment which varies on a period to period basis.
	
<P>
Capital additions of $142 million in the second quarter increased $42 million from last year.  Portfolio investments at GATX Capital were $236 million compared to $140 million in the 1995 second quarter. 

<P>

<B>General American Transportation Benefits from Larger Fleet</B>
	
<P>
General American Transportation Corporation, GATX's railcar leasing and management subsidiary, earned $17.1 million for the second quarter of 1996 compared to $16.1 million for the second quarter of 1995 which included a gain from the sale of a parcel of land in Mexico.  The increase in earnings resulted primarily from approximately 4,500 additional cars on lease versus a year ago and higher average rental rates.  Utilization of the domestic fleet was 94 percent at the end of the second quarter, the same high level as the first quarter, but down from 95 percent last year.  The total size of the General American domestic fleet at quarter end was 66,600 railcars compared to 61,700 a year ago.  On July 5, General American completed the purchase of the 55% interest in CGTX, Inc. that it did not already own from Hawker Siddeley Canada, Inc. bringing its total fleet to 77,000 railcars.
<P>


<B>Lower Petroleum Inventories Continue to Hinder GATX Terminals</B>
<P>

	GATX Terminals Corporation, the bulk liquid storage and pipeline subsidiary, reported earnings of  $4.6 million.  For the second quarter of 1995, GATX Terminals' net income was $8.3 million.  Lower petroleum inventories and backwardation in the futures market have adversely affected utilization and pricing in Los Angeles, Houston, and  New York.  In addition, GATX is experiencing petroleum market weakness in the United Kingdom and Singapore.  Utilization at the end of the second quarter was 86 percent, up from 85 percent at the end of the first quarter but down from 88 percent last year.   Throughput of 176 million barrels was eight percent greater than second quarter 1995, reflecting increased inventory turns of customers' products.  Pipeline operations and chemical storage markets remain strong worldwide.
<P>


<B>Excellent Earnings Results Continue at GATX Capital</B>
<P>

	GATX Capital Corporation, GATX's equipment financing subsidiary, reported earnings of $10.8 million compared to $11.5 million a year ago.  Gains from the sale of assets were $11.3 million pre-tax compared to the exceptionally strong $14.2 million a year ago.  Total revenues grew $13.8 million primarily as a result of incremental lease income due to the Sun Financial acquisition in 1995.
	
<P>
Second quarter portfolio investments of $236 million compared to $140 million a year ago reflect the high level of business opportunities available.  The volume includes primarily marine equipment, railroad rolling stock and locomotives, and technology equipment. 

<P>
<B>American Steamship Experiencing Strong Tonnage Demand</B>
<P>



	American Steamship Company, GATX's Great Lakes shipping operation, reported second quarter earnings of $1.3 million compared to earnings of $2.0 million a year ago.  The decline from last year's quarter was due to severe weather and ice conditions in April and May which significantly hampered vessel operations at the start of the sailing season.  Overall demand on the Great Lakes remains strong.

<P>

<B>Modest Earnings at GATX Logistics</B>
<P>

	GATX Logistics, Inc., GATX's warehousing, distribution and logistics support operation, reported net income of $.1 million, down $.1 million from a year ago.  Strong volumes with certain existing customers and new contracts were offset by higher SG&A expenses.

<P>
<B>Corporate Description</B>
<P>

	GATX Corporation provides approximately $5 billion of service-enhanced assets primarily used to help its customers transport, store or distribute their products.  GATX's assets include railcars and locomotives, bulk liquid terminals and pipelines, ships, warehouses, commercial aircraft, technology equipment, and other capital assets and related services worldwide.  GATX also offers a variety of financial services focusing on owning or managing transportation and distribution assets.

<BLOCKQUOTE>   <CENTER><B>Fiscal Year 1997<BR>
Second Quarter Report</B>
<P></CENTER>


LAS VEGAS, NV., November 7, 1996.  Gradco Systems, Inc. announced today the results of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 1996.  Net earnings decreased to $550,000, or $.07 per share, in the current quarter, from $819,000, or $.10 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 1995, and increased to $1,342,000, or $.17 per share, in the current six-month period, from $1,120,000, or $.14 per share, in the six months ended September 30, 1995.

<P>

Revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 1996 increased $1,673,000 and $2,832,000, respectively, from the comparable prior year periods principally as a result of increases in net sales.  Although unit sales in the copier market  were only 1% higher for the quarter and the yen decreased by 16% against the dollar, there was a change in mix of units sold in favor of higher price products.  In the six-month period, unit sales in the copier market were only 2% higher and the yen decreased by 12% against the dollar, but the Company's Venture Engineering subsidiary showed an increase of $2.3 million in net sales (primarily in the first quarter) in its contract manufacturing business.

<P>

Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 82.0% from 79.8% for the three months ended September 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively, and increased to 81.2% from 80.0% for the six-month periods then ended.  These increases are attributable to volume discounts earned by certain customers.

<P>

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") in the current quarter totaled $3,372,000, 12.7% of revenues, compared to $3,196,000, 12.9% of revenues, in the prior year's comparable period, an increase of $176,000.  This increase was attributable to a writeoff of $284,000 for a loan made to a prospective business partner, as well as to general increases at the operating subsidiary level, partially mitigated by approximately $300,000 of favorable translation of SG&A at the Company's Japanese subsidiary ("GJ") caused by the weaker yen.  For the six months ended September 30, 1996 and 1995, SG&A totaled $6,540,000, 12.4% of revenues and $7,082,000, 14.1% of revenues, respectively, a decrease of $542,000.  The favorable translation of SG&A at GJ associated with the weaker yen during this period accounted for a decrease of approximately $900,000 in SG&A, and a reduction of legal fees associated with the Hamma lawsuit, which was tried in June 1995, accounted for a decrease of $500,000.  These decreases were offset by the loan writeoff noted above, lower foreign currency translation gains and general increases at the operating subsidiary level.

<P>

As previously reported, in June 1995, a jury found the Company to have liability in the lawsuit by John C. Hamma, a former employee.  The Company has filed a motion to reverse the verdict.  After a determination by the Court on the Company's motion, a separate proceeding to determine the amount of damages will be required, with respect to such portion of the verdict, if any, as remains in effect.  An award of damages of the magnitude sought by Mr. Hamma could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and might threaten its existence as an ongoing enterprise.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>To Our Stockholders and Fellow Granite Employees:</I></B>
<P>

	Your company reported record revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 1996 of $248.5 million, an increase of 9.6% over the same period in 1995. Of that total, 71.4% was obtained from public sector business, with 18.1% coming from the private sector and 10.5% derived from aggregate sales. 
<P>
Geographically, 55.1% of quarterly revenue was derived from our California operations versus 62.2% last year,  a clear sign that we are succeeding in our efforts to diversify our revenue stream by adding businesses outside our California base.  Much of this activity is taking place in Florida, where we now have approximately $120 million worth of work underway.
	
<P>
Record net income for the quarter was $9.1 million, or $0.51 per share compared to $8.3 million or $0.47 per share for the second quarter ended June 30, 1995. The increase in net income is attributable to the successful execution of a higher volume of work, offset partially by  the dilutive effect of major projects which contributed to revenues during the quarter but have yet to reach the 25% threshold whereby the company would begin to recognize earnings.
	
<P>
For the six months ended June 30, 1996, revenue was $402.2 million, an increase of 21.2% over the same period in 1995.  Net income for the six month period was $9.5 million, or $0.53 per share, a decrease of 2% from a similar period last year.
	
<P>
Backlog at June 30, 1996 stood at $635.8 million, a decrease of 11.8% from the record level of $720.6 million at June 30, 1995 and does not include a $51.6 million Florida highway contract that was announced just after the quarter concluded.  New awards for the quarter totaled $259.9 million versus $302.9 million for the same period last year.
	
<P>
Going forward, the company is pursuing a number of quality heavy civil construction opportunities across the country, including a $1.0 billion design-build freeway reconstruction project in Salt Lake City, private toll roads in Minnesota, Delaware and Oregon and numerous highway projects in Florida, California, Nevada, Arizona, Illinois and Texas.
	
<P>
Moreover, we anticipate continued improvement in private sector opportunities in many of our geographic markets as California and the mountain states continue to outperform the rest of the country from an economic standpoint.  This should translate into increased commercial/residential site development opportunities as well as the potential for a slight margin improvement in our public sector marketplace.
	
<P>
The high level of bidding activity in which we are currently engaged is driven by the strong public sector funding now available from federal, state and local sources.  Looking out to next year, Congress is expected to appropriate about $19.6 billion for transportation-related construction in fiscal year 1997, a decrease of less than 1% from the prior year’s appropriation.  With the current cost-cutting mood of the Congress, our industry has been somewhat successful in convincing federal policy makers that continued investment in our transportation infrastructure is vital to a thriving economy.
	
<P>
Elsewhere in Washington, there is a move afoot to transfer 4.3 cents of the federal gasoline tax currently being used for deficit reduction to the highway trust fund, which would provide additional dollars for highway construction. Another bill to take the highway trust funds off budget has passed the House but has stalled in the Senate.
	
<P>
In California, the debate continues over how to pay for the increased cost of retrofitting Bay Area toll bridges.  The proceeds earmarked for this purpose from Proposition 192 fall far short of what’s needed and Bay Area politician’s want to use the state highway account to make up the shortfall.  Clearly, tapping the highway account would have an impact on our business, which is why we are advocating the use of toll revenues to fund the retrofit.
	
<P>
Locally in California, the use of sales taxes for transportation improvements will be put to the test in November when Santa Clara County voters will be asked to approve two separate measures that could overcome the obstacles imposed on these kinds of measures by Propositions 13 and 62.
	
<P>
Recognizing that we are heavily dependent on public funding, we continue to seek opportunities by which to diversify our sources of revenue, while at the same time retaining our focus on heavy civil construction and aggregate production.  The intent is to provide a better balance between public and private markets and take advantage of opportunities in other construction sectors.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To Our Stakeholders:

<P>

	GaSonics International Corporation (NASDAQ: GSNX) reported sales of $29.1 million for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 1996, a 4% increase over the comparable period in fiscal 1995. Net income for the quarter, excluding a non-recurring after-tax gain of approximately $93,000 from the sale of stock of a third party was $0.7 million or $0.05 per share. Net income for the prior year period, excluding a non-recurring after-tax gain of $ 1.8 million from sale of stock of a third party, was $3.8 million or $0.28 per share.

<P>

	Sales for the nine months ended June 30, 1996 were $99.8 million, a 39% increase over the comparable prior year period. Net income for the nine months, excluding the non-recurring after-tax gain recorded in the current quarter was $9.3 million or $0.68 per share. Net income for the comparable prior year period, excluding a non-recurring after-tax gain of $1.8 million from sale of stock of a third party, was $9.6 million or $0.73 per share.

<P>

	When we released our second quarter results in May, we reported that incoming orders were slowing due to announced delays in the start-up of customer fabs. This slowdown in orders has continued and has had a significant impact on our third quarter revenues and operating results. We expect that these conditions will continue to impact our revenues and earnings and have taken steps to manage our spending while continuing to support key programs. Our results have also been adversely impacted by reduced gross margins, due to a shift in product mix from higher margin, more mature products to newly introduced products which typically have lower margins during initial stages of production. Gross margins have also been adversely impacted by increased spending in the global field service and support operations.

<P>

	During the quarter, we announced competitive victories in the Japanese market for orders of single-wafer photoresist removal products with shipments starting in September 1996.   We also announced qualification by a major U.S. semiconductor manufacturer for the extension of our damage-free photoresist removal capabilities to .18-micron geometries. We also sold our first Vertical High Pressure furnace (VHP). In June, we received VLSI Research's 10 BEST award for customer satisfaction among small suppliers of wafer processing equipment.  We are very pleased with the acceptance of our new products, including the Performance Enhancement Platform (PEP).  We are ramping this important new product to fill orders to major customers in the U.S., Europe, Korea, Japan, and Asia. We are committed to improving the margins on this product as we reach volume production.

<P>

		Terry Gibson was recruited this quarter from LAM Research as Chief Financial Officer for GaSonics International.  Terry will provide additional strength to GaSonics in his experience with corporations with revenues exceeding $100 million.

<P>
Management would like to remind readers that any forward looking statements in this stakeholder’s report are always subject to risks in this ever-changing marketplace, including the cyclicality in the markets served by the Company's customers, market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the Company's products, the mix of products sold, the timing of significant orders and delays, deferrals and reschedulings of orders, and the proportion of direct sales and sales through distributors. For a more detailed discussion of these and associated risks, the Company refers the reader to documents filed with the SEC from time to time, specifically, the most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.  Also please visit our worldwide web site at http://www.gasonics.com for a variety of information on GaSonics International.

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In April, 1996, Genentech turned 20.  Just as we are proud of Genentech’s contributions in the past two decades — 10 of the currently marketed products of biotechnology stem from our research — I hope you are proud of your essential role in our success.  Ever since Robert Swanson and Herbert Boyer founded the company, Genentech has invested aggressively in R&D to lay the foundation for continued growth.  The results of the first quarter of 1996 show continued revenue growth but also a continued commitment to R&D as we prepare for earnings growth into the next century.

<P>
<a name="address"></a>
In an effort to provide more timely information about our progress, beginning with this 1996 first quarter report, we are trying this new format of our quarterly report.  We believe it will make it easier for you to follow our progress on a more timely basis. You can also get up-to-date information about Genentech at any time by visiting our new site on the World Wide Web, <A HREF="http://www.gene.com">http://www.gene.com</A>.

<P>

Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>GENENTECH 1996 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B>
<P>
<I>--Though revenues increased, earnings decreased as Genentech invested heavily in future potential products--</I>
<P>
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Genentech, Inc. announced on April 16, 1996, that earnings for the first quarter of 1996 declined 12 percent to $38.2 million, or 31 cents per share, from $43.4 million, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter of 1995.  Reported revenues increased 2 percent to $242.9 million from $239.0 million in the same quarter of 1995.  This revenue change reflects increases in contract revenues and royalties offset by reductions in sales, due primarily to Roche Holdings Inc.’s assumption of Canadian sales of Genentech products and European sales of Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa) Inhalation Solution in the fourth quarter of 1995. 
<P>

	“Our results for the first quarter of 1996 show growth in U.S. sales of our two leading product lines and a growth in royalty and contract revenues from our revised relationship with Roche,” said Genentech President and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Arthur D. Levinson.  “During the quarter we launched a new growth hormone product; filed for approval to market a new indication for Activase; began clinical trials for a new indication for DNase, the active ingredient in Pulmozyme; and entered one new business development agreement and expanded another.”

<P>


<B>Impact of New Roche Arrangement </B><BR>
	In late 1995, Genentech began receiving royalties rather than recording sales on European sales of Pulmozyme and Canadian sales of all Genentech products, as Roche assumed responsibility for those sales per Genentech’s new 1995 arrangement with Roche.  These changes have led to a reduction in reported product sales compared to the first quarter of 1995, but also to increased royalty revenues and decreased marketing, general and administrative expenses. On a pro forma basis that considers the new arrangement with Roche, product sales increased 3 percent to $152.3 million from $148.3 million in the first quarter of 1995. Reported total product sales were $152.3 million compared to $162.1 million in the first quarter of 1995.  Royalties increased to $52.9 million from $47.1 million in the first quarter of 1995.  MG&A expenses decreased to $52.0 million from $64.3 million in the first quarter of 1995.

<P>

<B>Marketed Products</B><BR>
	On a pro forma basis, sales of Activase® (Alteplase, recombinant), a tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA), increased to $76.6 million from $75.9 million in the first quarter of 1995, including a $3.8 million bulk shipment of t-PA to licensees in Japan in the first quarter of 1995.   This increase follows Food and Drug Administration clearance in April 1995 to promote an accelerated infusion of Activase and its mortality benefits, after which Genentech’s U.S. thrombolytic market share jumped from approximately 70 to 75 percent.  Reported total sales of Activase  decreased to $76.6 million from $78.2  million in the first quarter of 1995.
<P>

	On a pro forma basis, sales of Pulmozyme increased 6 percent to $18.9 million from $17.8 million in the first quarter of 1995, driven primarily by sales of Pulmozyme to Roche for ex-U.S. sales.  Principally due to Roche’s assumption of ex-U.S. sales, reported total sales of Pulmozyme decreased to $18.9 million from $28.5 million in the first quarter of 1995.  Approximately 60 percent of U.S. cystic fibrosis patients over age five currently receive Pulmozyme.
<P>

	On a pro forma basis, sales of Genentech’s Protropin® (somatrem for injection) and Nutropin® [somatropin (rDNA origin) for injection] growth hormones increased 4 percent to $56.0 million  from $53.7 million in the first quarter of 1995.   Reported total growth hormone sales increased to $56.0 million from $54.4 million in the first quarter of 1995.    During the quarter, Genentech launched the first liquid version of growth hormone, Nutropin AQ™ [somatropin (rDNA origin) injection] and an injection device, GenJect™, representing potentially important competitive advantages. Genentech continues to defend its patent position against potential new growth hormone competition and is in litigation against two potential competitors.
 
<P>

<B>Contract Revenues</B><BR>
	Contract and other revenues increased to $22.1 million from $16.2 million in the first quarter of 1995.  This increase resulted primarily from $17.1 million from Roche for its exercise of its option (per Genentech’s 1995 arrangement with Roche) to codevelop the IDEC-C2B8 monoclonal antibody for non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma outside of the United States.  Genentech is codeveloping with IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation the IDEC-C2B8 antibody, currently in Phase III clinical trials, for the same indication in the United States.

<P>

<B>R&D Expenses and Progress</B><BR>
	Research and development expenses were $115.6 million compared to $94.9 million in the first quarter of 1995.  This increase was related to clinical trials for Genentech’s products under development.  Also included is an up-front $5 million payment to Washington University to license worldwide rights to human neurturin, a protein in preclinical research for treating neurodegenerative disorders.  For the quarter, Genentech invested 48 percent of revenues into R&D.
<P>

	“For the short term we plan to invest almost half our revenues back into R&D,"  said Levinson.  “Though we will continue to increase absolute R&D investment as our revenues increase,  by the turn of the century we anticipate spending about 25 to 30 percent of our revenues on R&D.”
<P>

	Genentech made significant progress in product development during the quarter as it:
<br>
<UL>
<LI>Filed for approval for Activase in acute ischemic stroke.
<LI>Began clinical trials of DNase for lupus nephritis.
<LI>Made plans to file an investigational new drug application by year end for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for ischemia.
</ul><P>

	Also, during the quarter, Roche indicated it will not exercise its option for rights outside of the United States for Genentech’s anti-HER2 antibody for breast cancer.  Genentech is actively seeking a partner for ex-U.S. development of this product.

<P>

<B>Business Development</B><BR>
	During the quarter, Genentech:
<br>
<ul>
<LI>Expanded its agreement with IDEC to include its Y2B8 antibody,  a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma  now in Phase I trials.
<LI>Invested in Genenvax, Inc., created to continue the development and commercialization of gp120, a potential vaccine against HIV-1 infection, and agreed to provide Genenvax with exclusive rights to gp120.
</ul>
<P>

In conclusion, "Our progress during the first quarter of 1996 is right in line with our strategy for growth,” said Levinson, "as we strive to maximize sales of our marketed products, accelerate and expand our product development, increase the pace of forming strategic alliances and, ultimately, improve our financial returns."

<CENTER><B>GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS <BR>
PER SHARE RISES 24% IN THE
THIRD QUARTER OF 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>


Chicago, Illinois, November 5, 1996 -- General Growth Properties, Inc. (NYSE: GGP) today announced a substantial increase in earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Total Funds From Operations (FFO) for the quarter increased approximately 25% to $27.2 million, from $21.6 million in the third quarter of 1995.  On a per share basis the increase was approximately 24%, to $.62 in 1996, up from $.50 in 1995.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, total FFO increased 32% to $76.6 million compared to $57.9 million for the same period in 1995.  FFO per share for the nine months ended September 30, 1996, was $1.76, up approximately 23% from $1.43 per share last year.

<P>

Since completing its initial public offering in April 1993, General Growth’s average annualized  FFO per share growth rate has exceeded 15% per year.  This marks the fourteenth consecutive quarter of FFO growth.

<P>

Total prorata revenues, including General Growth’s share of CenterMark and GGP/Homart, were $88 million for the third quarter and $257.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1996, compared to $58 million and $163.4 million for the same periods in 1995.

<P>

Net operating income (NOI) increased by 38% in the quarter to $50.3 million, from $36.4 million during the third quarter of 1995.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, NOI increased by approximately 45% to $150.2 million from $103.9 million for the same period in 1995.

<P>

The Company reduces generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income by both non-cash straight line rent and gain on the sale of peripheral land to determine FFO.  FFO is intended by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) to be a better measure of operating performance than GAAP net income.  The Company believes that including non-cash straight line rent and gain from land sales in FFO would overstate current real estate operating results.  During the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 1996, straight line rent in the approximate amounts of $1.5 million and $4.6 million respectively, were excluded from GAAP net income to arrive at FFO.  Without this downward adjustment, FFO per share in the third quarter would have been $.65 rather than $.62, and FFO per share for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 would have been $1.86 rather than $1.76.

<P>

During the quarter, construction was completed on the 1,000,000-square-foot West Oaks Mall in Ocoee (Orlando), Florida, which opened at 83% occupancy on October 2, 1996, and is projected to have 89% occupancy by year-end.  In addition, sitework has begun on a new 900,000-square-foot mall located in Iowa City, IA.  Also, new department stores opened during the quarter included a 122,000-square-foot Dillard’s at Greenwood Mall in Bowling Green, Kentucky; a 114,000-square-foot Sears store at Oakwood Mall in Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and an 80,000-square-foot AMC theatre at Arrowhead Towne Center in Phoenix, Arizona.  General Growth also has the following development work under construction:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>A 100,000-square-foot Hudson’s department store at Birchwood Mall in Port Huron, Michigan

<LI>A 32,000-square-foot Mann theatre at Sequoia Mall in Visalia, California
</UL>
<P>

During the quarter it was also announced that General Growth Management, Inc. (GGMI), the property management subsidiary of GGP, has been awarded seven new contracts to manage regional malls for Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited.

<P>

"We are pleased with our results for the third quarter," said Matthew Bucksbaum, Chairman and CEO.  "We continue to be excited about the acquisition of General Growth Management, Inc. because of the many opportunities for third party management.  The addition of the Cadillac Fairview portfolio reaffirms this enthusiasm.  Through new management contracts, acquisitions of existing malls, the development of new malls, and remerchandising and expansions of existing properties we are continuing to increase shareholder value and profits."

<P>

General Growth Properties, Inc. is one of the oldest and most experienced shopping center owners, developers and managers in the United States.  It currently owns interests in and/or manages 115 shopping malls in 35 states, comprising approximately 83 million square feet of retail space.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</B> -- <I>(April 18, 1996)</I> -- General Instrument Corporation (NYSE: GIC) today reported sales for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996 of $616 million compared to $609 million in the first quarter of 1995. Order input was $648 million in the first quarter of 1996.  Backlog at March 31, 1996 was $791 million.

<P>

General Instrument’s terrestrial broadband businesses, including cable television systems, distribution electronics and CommScope cables, showed strong sales and order growth in this year’s first quarter compared to the first quarter of 1995.  The growth in the terrestrial broadband businesses was offset by an anticipated drop in sales and orders of VideoCipher analog satellite modules and receivers.

<P>

As expected, 1996 is a year of significant new product rollouts and investment for General Instrument.  First quarter 1996 financial results compared to the first quarter of 1995 reflect three specific transitions:  (1) lower initial gross margins from the introduction of next-generation broadband systems; (2) increased investment in research and development for future video, voice and data systems; and (3) higher effective income tax rates (38% in the first quarter of 1996 versus 23% a year ago). Accordingly, operating income for the first quarter of 1996 was $62 million compared to $87 million in the comparable 1995 period.  Income before income taxes was $50 million this quarter compared to $74 million in the first quarter of 1995, and net income was $31 million ($0.24 per fully diluted share) in the quarter compared to $57 million ($0.42 per fully diluted share) in the prior year first quarter.

<P>

On strong international demand, worldwide terrestrial broadband orders were up 11% in the first quarter of 1996 compared to the fourth quarter of 1995.  Orders for core analog addressable set top terminals increased 30% in this year’s quarter over the 1995 comparable quarter.  In addition, first quarter 1996 orders for distribution electronics increased 34% over first quarter 1995 and 36% sequentially from fourth quarter 1995, while orders for CommScope cables increased 35% in the first quarter of 1996 over the comparable 1995 quarter. 

<P>

International orders for GI’s terrestrial broadband businesses were at a record level, up 64% in the first quarter of 1996 from the comparable prior year quarter.  International orders represented 34% of GI’s worldwide terrestrial broadband business in the first quarter of 1996.

<P>

Worldwide terrestrial broadband sales in the first quarter of 1996 were up 14% from the first quarter of 1995, led by sales of both GI’s latest generation CFT 2200 advanced analog set top terminals and CommScope cables.  Sales of next-generation broadband systems, which include General Instrument’s digital satellite systems, advanced terrestrial subscriber systems and next-generation cableoptic systems, represented 27% of total consolidated sales in the first quarter of 1996 and increased 28% over the comparable prior year quarter.  On a geographic basis, General Instrument’s terrestrial broadband sales in the first quarter of 1996 increased in both the U.S. and international markets over the prior year first quarter. International sales  represented 31% of GI’s worldwide terrestrial broadband businesses in the first quarter of 1996.

<P>

 "General Instrument continued this quarter to implement its key strategies to increase shareholder value," said Richard S. Friedland, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  "First, we continued to grow our core businesses--existing analog broadband systems, distribution electronics and telecommunications cables--with U.S. and international customers.  Second, we made solid progress in rolling out our next generation of broadband products, both analog and digital.  These products continue to position GI as the world leader in secure end-to-end broadband systems for the years ahead.  Finally, we continue to invest in new high-growth markets such as cable modems for PCs, fiber-to-the-curb networks and emerging international markets." 

<P>

Building on its installed base of 178 DigiCipher satellite systems with the capacity to transmit 515 channels of digital programming, GI has begun shipment of its new MPEG-2 digital satellite systems with commitments to deliver 140 systems with the capacity to transmit 808 digital channels for programmers and service providers worldwide. In the cable television market, General Instrument has recorded orders for $9 million of its MPEG-2 digital  cable terminals, which are expected to begin shipping on schedule in the second half of 1996.

<P>

In April, General Instrument entered one of the world’s leading growth markets by signing a definitive joint venture agreement with HCL Corporation to produce GI’s full range of terrestrial broadband communication equipment for distribution in India as well as other emerging markets.  HCL Corporation is India’s largest manufacturer and distributor of information technology products and services.  Since 1991, India’s cable subscriber base has grown from zero to over 13 million, a milestone that took over 20 years to achieve in the U.S.  India’s cable subscriber base is expected to pass 50 million by the year 2000.  The joint venture with HCL Corporation is a significant step in General Instrument’s global strategy to become the premier supplier of complete end-to-end broadband systems in India and around the world.

<P>

GI’s Power Semiconductor Division sales were up 9% in the first quarter of 1996 compared to the prior year first quarter.  Division backlog was up 14% at March 31, 1996 compared to one year ago.

<P>

General Instrument Corporation, headquartered in Chicago,  is a world leader in developing technology, systems and product solutions for the interactive delivery of video, voice and data, as well as the development of discrete semiconductors.

To Our Stakeholders:

<P>

We recently reported that Genus’ net sales for the third quarter of 1996 were $13,892,000, down 49 percent from the third quarter of 1995.  Net loss for the quarter was ($8,105,000) or ($0.48) per share, compared with net income of $2,361,000 or $0.14 per share for the third quarter of 1995.  Also included in third quarter 1996 results is a $3,540,000 special charge due to a capacity-related reduction in our workforce.
<P>

The Company’s net sales for the first nine months of 1996 were $65,347,000 and net loss was ($6,867,000) or ($0.41) per share.  In comparison, Genus’ net sales for the first nine months of 1995 were $74,824,000 and net income was $6,639,000 or $0.42 per share.
When the semiconductor industry experienced a downturn earlier this year and DRAM prices plunged, Genus’ revenues were seriously affected.  Since much of our backlog was for DRAM production, some orders were pushed out or canceled and certain new orders were delayed.  In response to these conditions, we’ve implemented significant cost reduction measures, including a decrease in the workforce, to curtail overhead and conserve cash.
<P>

In addition, with the process simplification advantages offered by Genus’ systems, we’ve broadened our customer base to include logic and other non-DRAM applications in both existing and new geographic areas.

<CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER REPORT
For the Period Ending September 28, 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

To Our Stockholders:

<P>

We are pleased to report that Genlyte continues to improve  its financial performance.  In the third quarter of 1996, net income increased 67% and earnings per share rose 63%.  Through nine months, net income increased 57% and earnings per share are up 55%.  Sales in the quarter grew 3% and are up 1% year-to-date.  Interest expense declined $600,000 for the quarter and $1.7 million year-to-date due to debt reduction of approximately $26 million in the past twelve months.  Our improved earnings for the quarter are the result of an increase in sales and continued focus on productivity improvement. 

<P>

In the third quarter we completed construction of our new  Genlyte TechCenter located in Fall River, Massachusetts.  This new TechCenter features a full range of Genlyte lighting fixtures and controls displayed in an interactive environment.  This facility allows lighting professionals to see first hand our products and the effects of good lighting.  The TechCenter will be utilized to train lighting professionals, including our own salespeople, distributor personnel, and others who have a desire to learn more about the value of quality lighting.  Everyone who has visited this facility, including architects, specifiers, distributors, and contractors, are unanimous in describing it as an outstanding vehicle for demonstrating the use of good lighting.  We have also completed the expansion of our plant in Camargo, Mexico and added a new, technically advanced powder coat paint system.  This facility is now prepared to manufacture a broad array of Genlyte products at a significant savings in manufacturing costs.

<P>

We are pleased with our improved financial performance through the first nine months of this year and we expect our trend of improved earnings to continue through year-end.  We would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for  your continued confidence and support of Genlyte, our valued customers, and employees.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><U><B>GEORGIA GULF REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></U></CENTER>

<P>

Atlanta, October 17, 1996 -- Georgia Gulf Corp. today reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.56 on net income of $19.9 million and sales of $237.9 million.  Earnings per share for the third quarter of 1995 were $1.15 on net income and sales of $44.5 million and $270.9 million, respectively.
<P>

	For the first nine months of this year, the company reported earnings per share of $1.50 on net income of $55.0 million and sales of $677.4 million.  This compares to earnings per share of $3.90, net income of $155.4 million and net sales of $860.7 million for the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

	For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996, operating income was $37.6 million and $103.9 million, respectively, down from $77.2 million and $273.3 million reported for the same periods last year.
<P>

	Comparing the quarters ended September 30, 1996 and 1995, overall sales volumes were moderately lower. Although sales volumes increased for aromatics and vinyl resins and compounds, these gains were unable to offset reduced production volumes due to scheduled maintenance turnarounds at the company's chlorine/caustic and VCM plants during the third quarter of 1996.  The average selling price of the company's products also posted lower results, largely due to sharp declines in vinyl resin prices from the prior year period.  Profit margins were lower for all products with the exception of vinyl compounds which did show some improvement.
<P>

	When comparing the nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 and 1995, product sales volumes were below prior year levels with the exception of vinyl resins and compounds where volumes increased.  Pricing for nearly all of the company's products was lower in 1996 with the most notable declines coming from the company's vinyl products chain and methanol.
<P>

	    In comparing sequential quarters ended June 30 and September 30, 1996, operating income climbed 4 percent on higher overall sales volumes and a slight increase in the average sales price of the company's products. Sales volumes were down for many of the company's products as a result of scheduled 
maintenance turnarounds.  The company said, however, these declines were more than offset by a significant increase inaromatic sales volumes attributable in part to the completion of the new cumene expansion early in the third quarter. A tightening of the supply and demand balance for methanol provided a boost to the methanol selling price which enabled the company to overcome some pricing erosion in other products.  Margins for the company's vinyl products continued to be depressed in spite of good demand and low inventory levels.
<P>

	Commenting on the results, Jerry R. Satrum, president and C.E.O., said, "Third quarter results were basically in line with our expectations, taking into consideration the scheduled maintenance turnarounds.  We are encouraged by the performance of our aromatics products and the contribution from additional cumene capacity.  We are also pleased that methanol has returned to profitability.  However, we continue to be very disappointed with the poor margins that we are experiencing in our vinyl resin business, particularly given the strong sales volumes.
<P>

	 "As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate some seasonal slowdown with certain products but are hopeful we will see a continuation of good results in aromatics and methanol," Satrum added. "Longer term though, we feel very positive as we move into 1997. The greater benefits we should realize from our share repurchase programs, together with our added capacity and cost reduction projects should provide the basis for a better year ahead."
<P>

GIANT’s results for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996 reflect capital gains from the sale of certain investments in stocks and bonds and improved performance of the Company’s 21% owned affiliate Rally’s Hamburgers, Inc.  These gains were reduced by higher legal and travel expenses related to the review of possible acquisitions.  
<P>
In the fourth quarter, GIANT announced the formation of a new, wholly owned subsidiary, GIANT MARINE GROUP, LTD. that will formulate, develop and implement a unique ownership concept in the yachting world. GIANT has acquired two yachts at a cost of $21,000,000, with $10,600,000 to be paid over the next three months.  The formal plan will be announced in the early part of 1997. 
<P>
During the fourth quarter of 1996, CKE Restaurants, Inc., the parent of Carl’s Jr., and Fidelity National Financial, Inc. continued to increase their position in  Rally’s, by exercising from GIANT in total, 1,175,214 options to purchase Rally’s common stock.  As a result, GIANT received approximately $3,500,000 and recognized a book gain of approximately $2,500,000.  GIANT’s ownership in Rally’s is now approximately 15%.

<CENTER><B>GISH BIOMEDICAL REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS FOR FISCAL 1997</B></CENTER>	    

<P>



Irvine, CA (November 13, 1996)....Gish Biomedical, Inc. (Nasdaq: GISH) today reported results for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Sales increased slightly and net income in the quarter improved over the same period last year, despite costs associated with development of a direct sales force, increased research and product development costs, higher manufacturing expenses associated with the Northern California facility, which is scheduled for closure in the current quarter, and related increases in general and administrative expenses, as well as amortization of goodwill related to the purchase of the infusion pump business.  Results for the fiscal 1996 period included an expense item of $702,000 related to a distributor contract termination.

<P>

Sales for the quarter were $5,312,600 versus $5,271,200 a year ago.  Net income for the 1997 first quarter was $61,500, or $.02 per share compared with a net loss of $84,100, or $.03 per share in the first quarter of 1996. 

<P>

The quarter's results reflected higher research and development expense, primarily for the upgrading of the ambulatory infusion pump product acquired from Creative Medical Development, Inc. last year.  The ambulatory infusion pump product is expected to expand Gish's presence into the home health care market.  

<P>

The pump is one of a slate of new products Gish plans for the near future.  These include a re-designed MyoManager cardioplegia management product and an oxygenator which is in the process of receiving FDA clearance, both of which are planned for introduction in January 1997.  Gish has invested significant resources in the development of its first oxygenator which is a key component of the cardiovascular circuit.  Essentially replacing the activity of the lungs during surgery, the oxygenator enables gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide and also regulates the temperature of the patient's blood.  Upon receipt of 510(K) clearance, the oxygenator will be sold as a separate yet integral component of the cardiovascular bypass circuit and will expand the potential market for Gish's products.

<P>

"We expect further improvement in operating income later this year as we realize the benefits of new product introductions and the cost savings from the closure of the Northern California facility," stated Jack W. Brown, chairman and president of Gish.  "We are continuing to make investments in research and development, and direct sales efforts to strategically expand Gish in our existing and new specialty markets."

<P>

The company's balance sheet remains strong, with working capital of $15.2 million, a current ratio of 12:1 and shareholders' equity of $21.1 million at September 30, 1996.

<P>

Gish Biomedical, Inc. designs and manufactures disposable physician-preference products for various surgical specialties.  The company offers premier devices for use in cardiovascular and orthopedic surgery and oncology, in addition to the new line of ambulatory infusion pumps.

<P>

This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties.  As discussed in Gish's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 1996, assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions, and future business decisions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict  accurately and many of which are beyond the control of Gish.  Although Gish believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in forward-looking statements will be realized.  In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking information included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Gish or any other person that Gish's objectives or plans will be achieved.

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

For the quarter ended June 30, 1996, we reported a net loss of $282,479 resulting in a loss of $6,114 for the first six months.  Revenues were $2,162,719 and $4,813,507 for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 1996, respectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities (before changes in working capital) for the quarter and six months was $815,765 and $2,274,648, respectively.  Daily production averaged 4,400 Mcf and 440 Bbls in the second quarter and 4,400 Mcf and 480 Bbls for the six months.  Prices received averaged $2.59 per Mcf and $21.11 per Bbl for the quarter and $2.52 per Mcf and $19.87 per Bbl for the six months.

<P>

We are disappointed that we reported net losses even though they relate primarily to three dry holes which were expensed during the quarter under our successful efforts method of accounting.  In spite of these results, however, I am confident that we are on the right track to building the reserve and asset base that will improve our bottom line and, thereby, enhance shareholder value.

<P>

We have drilled and set pipe on seven new wells so far this year.  These wells are in various stages of completion and testing.  The results on two of these wells, the GPC, Miami Corp. 5 No. 1 in the South Pecan Lake Field and the GPC, Youngblood No. 1 in the Ada Field have been announced recently.  Such results were 2,100 Mcf of gas per day and 192 barrels of oil per day from the Miami Corp. 5 No. 1 and 7,000 Mcf per day and 14 barrels of condensate per day from the Youngblood No. 1.  Based on these results, these wells should increase our daily gas production by an aggregate of approximately 2,500 Mcf or more than 50% from the current level.  The Youngblood No. 1 began production in the latter part of September and it is anticipated that the Miami Corp. 5 No. 1 should begin production in mid November.

<P>

On the exploration front, we are continuing to generate new prospects, several of which are ready for drilling.  We expect to be actively drilling new exploratory prospects in the last half of 1996 and continuing into 1997.

<P>

We thank you for your continued support and hope that you will share our enthusiasm for the future growth potential of our Company.

<P>

Yours very truly,

<CENTER><B>Second Quarter Fiscal 1997 Report</B></CENTER>

<P>

 Dear fellow shareholder:

<P>

We’re very pleased to report that Go-Video continued its solid performance in the second quarter of its 1997 fiscal year, as we increased revenues, reported significant earnings gains and reduced expenses while investing prudently in the future.  Higher shipments of Dual-Deck videocassette recorders and reduced operating expenses were primarily responsible for the substantially higher earnings. 

<P>

Specifically, for the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the company posted revenues of $9.4 million, versus $9.2 million for the same quarter of fiscal year 1996. Net income increased to $293,000, or $0.03 per share, versus $29,000, or $0.00 per share, for the second quarter one year prior.  Operating expenses for the quarter declined $361,000 to $1.7 million, even while the company increased spending on product development and advertising.

<P>

For the six months ended September 30, 1996, Go-Video posted revenues of $17.6 million, up 9 percent from sales of $16.1 million in the comparable period of the prior year.  Earnings of $480,000, or $0.04 per share, compared favorably with a loss of $658,000, or $0.06 per share, for the six months of the prior year, resulting in a $1.2 million positive swing in earnings.

<P>

 
Unit shipments for the first half of fiscal 1997 were up almost 30 percent over the prior year.  Setting the pace was the company’s new leader model, the GV6010 Dual Deck VCR, which sells for $399 in most retail locations.  We’re extremely pleased with the reception of the new $399 product in the  current soft retail market. Despite lower average 

<P>

selling prices, we were able to maintain gross margins and as a result of our lower retail prices, we now have an opportunity to increase our revenues and earnings through expanded distribution and increased consumer demand.

<P>

Go-Video began its first national television and print advertising campaign in September.  This was too late to have measurable impact on the second-quarter results.  However, the company has begun to see a favorable impact from the advertising during the current quarter.  This is particularly true in local markets where the campaign had been concentrated.

<P>

We are continuing to invest in the development of high-end digital direct view televisions and liquid-crystal-display (LCD) rear-projection televisions for the rapidly growing home-theater market.  Introduction of these products is expected late next year.

<P>

We have made considerable investments to continue to  improve our future financial performance.  We are successfully implementing a high-growth strategy and are very pleased with the shape of our fiscal year.


<P>

Sincerely, </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Shareholders:
<P>

The First Quarter of 1996 continued the rebuilding process of Greyhound Lines.
<P>

In the first three months -- traditionally the slowest travel quarter of the year -- Greyhound continued to experience increased ridership and passenger revenue. This was achieved despite the impact of harsh winter weather on sales.
<P>

During the quarter, there was an 8.1 percent increase in passengers and a 7.5 percent increase in operating revenues, even though we also increased our service miles by 5.5 percent. Over the same period, Greyhound registered a 2.2 percent decline in yield, or revenue per passenger mile, reflecting a continuing shift in ridership toward longer trips.
<P>

The Company's expenses also increased, up 9.0 percent, reflecting a continuation of increased spending levels that began in the second quarter of 1995. Although we are reporting a net loss of $21.5 million or $(0.37) per share, we believe that investments in the addition of route miles, increased advertising, additional driver training and other infrastructural improvements are necessary to support continued expansion of the business and return of the Company to profitability.
<P>

Now into our second year of operating improvements and everyday low fares, we are addressing the challenge of attaining year over year growth that is measured against the increases we posted last year. Accordingly, our ongoing focus will be to provide the best service possible to current ridership, while attracting additional passengers to Greyhound, particularly as we prepare for the important summer travel season.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote>

 San Diego, California (October 16, 1996) —GTI Corporation (NASDAQ: GGTI) today reported financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1996, ended September 30, 1996.
<P>

	For the third quarter, sales were $24.6 million compared to $35.3 million for the prior-year period.  The net loss was ($5.1 million) or ($0.57) per share vs. net income from continuing operations of $2.5 million or $0.22 per share.
<P>

	For the first nine months, sales were $82.2 million compared to $95.3 million for the prior-year period.  The net loss was ($9.5 million) or ($1.06) per share vs. net income from continuing operations of $3.7 million or $0.34 per share.
<P>

	Results for the third quarter included a $1.9 million charge for the closing of the Valor Electronics’ Hong Kong facility.  The charge represents employee severance costs, property lease costs, and the write-off of certain assets.
<P>

	Sales at Valor Electronics for the third quarter were $20.6 million vs. $31.4 million.
<P>

	"Third-quarter results reflect the continuing negative effect of operating costs not recoverable against the decreased sales volume at Valor Electronics," said Albert J. Hugo-Martinez, GTI president and chief executive officer.  "We are working to resize Valor’s operations in light of the reduced sales while maintaining the capacity to respond to an upswing in demand."
<P>

	Sales at Promptus Communications for the third quarter were $4.0 million vs. $3.9 million for the same period last year.  GTI has retained Montgomery Securities as financial advisor to assist GTI’s Board of Directors in exploring the strategic alternatives available relating to Promptus to enhance shareholder value.
	
<P>

	GTI Corporation is an active participant in the worldwide market for networking and network-access products.  Through Valor Electronics, it is a leading supplier of magnetics-based components for signal processing and power-management functions in networking products.  Through Promptus Communications, it provides "bandwidth-on-demand" management for worldwide networking.

Re: 	Sabi Mine Progress Report
</B>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Guyana Shareholder,
<P>


We believe you appreciate being kept informed on companies in which you own shares.

<P>

For that reason, we are sending you this brief update on the progress now being made at Guyana Gold Corp.’s majority-owned Sabi Gold Mine in Zimbabwe.

<P>

As you are probably aware, the Sabi – which has been in continuous production for over 100 years – is currently producing gold at a rate of 12,000 ounces per year. You are also probably aware that a major upgrade of the mine facilities is underway, the goal of which will be a 40,000 ounce annual production by 1998.

<P>

Of even greater importance, however, is the progress being made with Guyana’s current drilling program. This program, which began in March and which is scheduled to last into mid-September, has as its goal to double the resource from an estimated 1.2 million ounces of gold, to at least 2.4 million ounces. 

<P>

So far, despite some minor delays caused by the hardness of the rock, the new exploration program – which is using three drill rigs – has resulted in adding another 400,000 ounces of gold to the known resource. That brings the Sabi’s potential up to 1.6 million ounces.

<P>

As the exploration team has so far taken samples from only 3.5 kilometers of the 17 kilometer long strike zone, we are extremely confident that the expansion program will meet and, most likely, exceed its goal.

<P>

<B>A Look Ahead</B>
<P>


One of the more interesting aspects of the Sabi Mine is that there has never been any drilling/exploration below the level of 350 meters. Yet, in the Southern African region where the mine is located, the average ounce of gold is mined at a depth of 2,500 meters.

<P>

Therefore, once the current resource expansion is completed, it is the company’s plan to embark upon an "at depth" drilling program, designed to search for a far larger ore body below the depth of 350 meters.

<P>

In order to keep shareholders closely informed during this important period in the company’s life, we have retained the London Taylor Group to provide shareholder communications. A more comprehensive Corporate Profile has been prepared and is available with a phone call to (800) 379-1039.  By calling that number, you also have the option of receiving additional updates on Guyana’s progress at the Sabi, including by fax, if you so desire. If you are holding your shares in a "street name" and wish to be kept up-to-date, it is essential that you call that number and register for further communications.

<P>

These are exciting times for Guyana Gold Corp. (GUY, TSE), and for our shareholders. Look for additional news on the current expansion program -- and on the Company’s strategic plans in the near future.

<P>

Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

  Under the agreement, the group will purchase the stock of Handex’s environmental subsidiaries for cash and other consideration, including a promissory note and preferred stock.  Proceeds from the sale and from retained assets will amount to approximately $21 million after recognizing a $7.3 million loss on the disposal of this segment for the write-off of goodwill, establishment of valuation reserves and transaction costs.  The sale is subject to stockholder approval and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1996.
  Handex’s environmental business had net operating revenues of $46.5 million and net income of $450,000 for 1995, and net operating revenues of $33.3 million and a net loss of $135,000 for the first nine months of 1996.  These results are reported as "discontinued operations" in the schedule presented below.  The 
subsidiaries being sold operate out of 18 locations in 14 states, predominantly in the eastern half of the United States, and perform environmental remediation services primarily at retail gasoline stations.
<P>

  This transaction is part of a strategic initiative to concentrate the Company’s resources and energies in the faster growing computer education and training industry in which it participates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, New Horizons Education Corporation (New Horizons).  Headquartered in Santa Ana, California, New Horizons operates seven company-owned learning centers and franchises 136 locations worldwide.  New Horizons is one of the fastest growing companies in the computer training industry.  System-wide sales, which include both company-owned and franchised results, have risen from $23 million in 1993 to $103 million in 1995.  System-wide sales were $138 million for the first nine months of 1996.  Proceeds from the sale will fund both internal growth and future acquisitions.
<P>

  Upon closing of the transaction, the name Handex will be transferred to the buying group and the Company’s name will be changed to "New Horizons Worldwide, Inc.". 
<P>

  Revenues for the  educational business for the 1996 third quarter were $10,484,000, up 74.5 percent from $6,007,000 for the third quarter of 1995.  Quarterly income from continuing operations was $260,000, or $.04 per share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $673,000, or $.10 per share, for the third quarter of 1995.  
<P>

  The net loss for the 1996 third quarter was $6,861,000 million, or $1.00 a share, compared with a net loss of $608,000, or $.09 per share, for the third quarter of 1995.  Financial results for the third quarter of 1996 include the previously mentioned $7.3 million loss on the disposal of discontinued operations.  Results for the 1995 third quarter include charges totaling $812,000 to provide for an investment loss in a joint venture and an asset write-off.
<P>

  For the first nine months of 1996, revenues advanced 76.5 percent to $29,578,000 from $16,754,000 for the corresponding period in 1995.  Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 1996 was $622,000, or $.09 per share, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $648,000, or $.09 per share, for the same period in 1995.  The net loss for the first nine months of 1996 was $6,816,000, or $.99 per share, compared with net income of $1,000, or breakeven on a per-share basis, in 1995.
<P>

  Same-store revenue growth, additional franchises added to the system, and improved profitability at company-owned locations were the primary reasons for the improvement in both revenues and income from continuing operations for the quarter and the year to date. 
  System-wide revenues, which include both franchised and company-owned results, rose 84.1 percent for the 1996 third quarter to $50,817,000 from $27,610,000 for last year’s corresponding quarter.  For the first nine months of 1996, system-wide revenues rose 95.7 percent to $138,072,000 from $70,554,000 for the first nine months of last year.  There were 143 New Horizons training centers worldwide at the end of the 1996 third quarter.  An additional 34 have been sold and will open in the future.
<P>

  New Horizons’ educational and training companies operate computer training centers under the name "New Horizons Computer Learning Centers."  The Company franchises operations worldwide and operates company-owned facilities in New York City, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Santa Ana, California.  These centers provide instruction primarily to employer-sponsored enrollees in PC software applications, networking, operating systems, Internet, and client/server programming.

<blockquote><B>FISCAL 1996 SECOND QUARTER REPORT </B>
<P>

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:<P>
Earnings from continuing operations in the second quarter of fiscal 1996 decreased to 14 cents per share from 16 cents per share in the second quarter of 1995 due to lower operating earnings from specialty retailing and reduced investment income.  Our publishing businesses generated an operating loss, as expected, of $14.9 million in this seasonally weak quarter, compared to the $20.3 million operating loss incurred in the second quarter of 1995.  The smaller loss reflects significantly higher operating earnings from the Company=s scientific, technical, medical and professional (STMP) publishing group, helped by higher book sales at WB Saunders and increased journal sales at both WB Saunders and Academic Press.  Our educational publishing operations had higher revenues in the quarter, reflecting early sales of elementary reading, science and math programs as well as increased revenues from the Company=s testing business.  The educational publishing group had an operating loss for the quarter approximately equal to that incurred in the 1995 period.<P>
Results from The Neiman Marcus Group, our 59%-owned specialty retailing subsidiary, are consolidated with a one quarter lag. As previously reported, operating earnings for specialty retailing decreased 13.3% to $48.6 million in the quarter, down from $56.0 million in last year's quarter.  The NM Direct mail order business had sharply higher earnings in the quarter, but they were more than offset by lower earnings at Neiman Marcus Stores and Bergdorf Goodman, where a very promotional holiday selling season necessitated higher markdowns, which reduced gross margins.  The Neiman Marcus Group contributed after-tax earnings from continuing operations of $22.2 million, equal to 30 cents per share, to Harcourt General's 1996 second quarter compared to earnings of $24.4 million, equal to 31 cents per share, a year earlier.  The Neiman Marcus Group recently reported record earnings for its third quarter ended April 27, 1996.  Those results will be consolidated with our third quarter ending July 31, 1996 and will contribute after-tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $18.2 million, or 25 cents per share, to Harcourt General's earnings for that period.  In the comparable 1995 quarter, The Neiman Marcus Group contributed after-tax earnings from continuing operations of $10.5 million, equal to 14 cents per share, to Harcourt General's results. <P>
Operating earnings from our professional services segment increased 48.8% in the quarter to $4.3 million from $2.9 million in 1995.  Expense reduction efforts coupled with strengthening in demand for executive outplacement programs contributed to the improvement.<P> 
Our publishing operations typically incur losses in the first half of the fiscal year because of the relatively few opportunities to sell educational textbooks.  However, the third and fourth quarters are very important to Harcourt General's full-year performance since the majority of our educational textbook sales occur during these periods.  We remain confident that both our publishing and specialty retailing operations will meet our expectations for the full year.<P>

Sincerely,</blockquote><P>

Dear Stockholder:
<P>

For the first six months of 1996, the Company earned $14,246,000 or $1.13 per share on gross income of $25,516,000.  In the same period last year, earnings were $9,502,000 or $.82 per share on gross income of $19,303,000.

<P>

Cash Available for Distribution for the first six months of 1996 totaled $16,538,000 or $1.32 per share compared to $11,296,000 or $.97 per share for the same period last year.  Funds From Operations for the six months ended June 30, 1996 totaled $13,148,000 or $1.05 per share compared with $10,282,000 or $.88 per share for the same period last year.

<P>

The operating results for the first six months of 1996 reflect the growth in the loan and operating lease portfolio.  As of June 30, 1996, total assets were $434.5 million, a 16.74% increase from June 30, 1995 and a 21.33% increase from December 31, 1995.  Operating results for the first half of 1996 were positive.  Contributing factors to the positive operating results were improved earnings on assets, a reduction to the Company’s average cost of borrowing and increased investment activity.  Investment activity in loans receivable and operating leases, net of principal collected on loans and return of capital associated with the exercise of purchase options, totalled $74.8 million for the first six months of 1996.

<P>

The Company’s operating expenses decreased 15.88% in the first six months of 1996 versus the first half of 1995.  The 1995 other operating expenses included management fees.  The reduction in operating expenses was primarily due to cost savings realized as a result of the merger of the Company’s advisor into the Company and the achievement of self-administered status.

<P>

In addition, net income was affected by the Company’s decision to increase its unallocated allowance for losses by $300,000 during the first six months of 1996.

<P>

During the second quarter of 1996, the Company issued secured Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $30,000,000, which mature in 2001 and 2003, and have a weighted average interest rate of 7.18%.

<P>

During the second quarter of 1996, the Company issued 2,322,200 Shares of Common Stock, $1.00 par value per share, at the price of $22.00 per share, which generated net proceeds of $48,184,000 to the Company.

<P>

Under the Company’s By-Laws, stockholders must be notified when total operating expenses (for the twelve-month period then ended) exceed 2% of average invested assets or 25% of adjusted net income, whichever is greater.  For the twelve-month period ended June 30, 1996, total operating expenses, which totalled $9,893,000, exceeded 2% of average invested assets and exceeded 25% of adjusted net income.  This was primarily due to costs incurred by the Company relating to the merger with the Company’s former advisor.  When the subject compliance test was adjusted for the expense associated with the contract settlement, the Company was in compliance.

<P>

On July 16, 1996, the Board of Directors voted to pay a quarterly dividend of $.52 per share on August 20, 1996, payable to shareholders of record on August 2, 1996.

<P>

The Company has investments in 125 health care facilities in 28 states and has total assets of approximately $434 million.  The Company invests primarily in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, retirement centers and specialty care facilities.

<P>

Health Care REIT, Inc. will continue its investment focus on the long-term care sector of the health care industry.  In addition, the Company will continue to implement its strategy of providing growth capital to emerging health care operators.  Management remains committed to increasing shareholder value.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Shareholders:
<P>
If asked to identify the one element that is most critical to our future success, everyone at Health o meter would agree that it is our ability to consistently introduce new and exciting products and product-line extensions. Innovation drives this business. Just a few weeks ago, we announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Culligan Water Technologies, Inc., and shortly thereafter, unveiled our new Health o meter® WATER BY Culligan® line of water filter pitchers at the Gourmet Products Show in San Francisco. This is the first in a line of new product introductions to result from our association with Culligan, whose water purification technology and strong brand identity will further enhance our competitive position in the burgeoning home healthcare market. Also well received at the recent Gourmet Products Show this year were our extensive new line of therapeutic devices and several additions to our line of Mrs.Tea™ automatic hot teamakers.
<P>
For the second quarter of our 1996 fiscal year, we recorded net income of $10,000, or break-even on a per-share basis, on net sales of $56.3 million. Despite severe winter weather during January and February that caused a slowdown in consumer traffic, the Consumer Products Division posted sales growth of 4.7 percent primarily on continued strong sales of Mrs. Tea™, our automatic hot teamaker. We also benefited from an increase in sales of consumer scales, attributable to our successful efforts to improve the distribution of this product among mass merchandisers. Net sales in our Professional Products Division were down 22.3 percent, facing a difficult comparison with last year’s second quarter when sales were favorably affected by the U.S. postal rate increase in January 1995. The improvement in net income from last year’s second quarter net loss of $153,000, or $0.02 per share, was primarily the result of an improved sales mix, which included sales of recently introduced higher-margin products. Our efforts to effectively control selling, general, and administrative expenses also had a positive effect on profitability.
<P>
The Company’s performance year-to-date has been solid and, we believe, reflects the steadfast commitment of everyone at this organization to ensure our long-term growth and profitability. Ongoing efforts to bring new products to market and improve productivity more than doubled first-half net income to $2.0 million, or $0.22 per share, on a net sales increase of 4.3 percent.
<P>
We began the 1996 fiscal year on a good note, and we continue to be optimistic with the completion of the second quarter. We are excited about creating new opportunities to focus our strong brand recognition and distribution capabilities on achieving profitable growth in new consumer, professional, and commercial product categories. We thank you for your continued support and look forward to reporting on our progress during the remainder of the year.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

To Our Stockholders:	
<P>

During the second quarter of 1996, your management team focused on the continued execution of our strategic plan. We exceeded earnings expectations with solid, same-store growth in all divisions while successfully integrating our recent acquisitions into our national network and further enhancing our managed care relationships and national accounts.	
<P>
We continued on course toward our goal of expanding our network of facilities to the top 300 markets in the country, and at June 30, 1996, operated nearly 1,000 facilities in 46 states. 
<P>
The Company completed the acquisition of Harmarville Rehabilitation Center, one of the nation’s leading independent rehabilitation hospitals, acquired more than 25 new outpatient rehabilitation locations and announced the acquisition of Professional Sports Care Management, Inc. (NASDAQ: PSCM), which operates 36 outpatient rehabilitation locations. We completed that acquisition in the third quarter.	The Company has continued to focus on developing and implementing its Integrated Service Model, a seamless delivery system that includes diagnostic, outpatient rehabilitation and surgery, and inpatient facilities. Today, HEALTHSOUTH operates its Integrated Service Model in over 30 markets, and the number of national and regional payor contracts has grown from approximately 1,300 at March 31, 1996, to more than 1,600 at June 30, 1996. We will continue to provide high quality, cost-effective services to managed care networks and self-insured employers through volume contracting on a national basis.	
<P>
We appreciate your support of The Healthcare Company of the 21st Century.
<P>

Sincerely,		</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>   <CENTER><B>HELIX REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS AND QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND</B></CENTER>

<P>

MANSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS… Helix Technology Corporation (NASDAQ NMS symbol: HELX) today announced that net income for the third quarter ended September 27, 1996, was $3.9 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to the third quarter of 1995 when net income was $5.5 million, or $0.55 per share.  Sales for the third quarter of 1996 were $25.1 million compared with $32.3 million a year ago.

<P>

Net income for the nine months ended September 27, 1996, was $18.8 million, or $1.88 per share, compared with net income of $14.8 million, or $1.48 per share, for 1995.  Sales for the nine-month period were $104.7 million in 1996 versus $88.4 million in 1995.

<P>

Commenting on the results, Helix President, Robert J. Lepofsky, said, "After sixteen consecutive quarters of sequential earnings growth, the expected weakening in the semiconductor equipment market has resulted in lower orders, lower sales and lower earnings per share.  The Company’s profit performance in light of the 36 percent decline in revenues from the immediately preceding quarter demonstrates our ability to withstand the pressures inherent in this market.  While the duration of this phase of the semiconductor capital equipment cycle is uncertain, we remain well positioned for both the near-term challenges and the longer-term opportunities."

<P>

The Company also announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share.  The dividend is payable on November 14, 1996, to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 31, 1996.

<P>

Helix Technology Corporation is the leader in the development and application of cryogenic and vacuum technology.  Helix is recognized for providing innovative solutions to customer requirements.  Today, the global electronic component manufacturing industry is its largest single market.

Third Quarter Report - September 30, 1995
<p>



To Our Shareholders,
<p>
	In third quarter 1995, your company produced revenues of $2,745,000 which resulted in a net income of $25,000 after research and development expense. The Company's core blood products and services business, before research and development expenses, produced net income of $223,000 for the third quarter. 
<p>	In late November, we announced the Board of Directors' decision to discontinue Immupath research and development, an experimental HIV/AIDS project.  The winding  down  of  the Immupath project  and  the HemaBiologics' specialty plasmaoperations will result in a non-recurring charge against fourth quarter earnings estimated to be approximately $2.9 million.  We do not anticipate these discontinued operations will have any future material financial impact upon our operating performance.  In addition, we are still exploring opportunities in which Immupath development could be continued by a third party.  
<p>	Although the decision has been made to terminate the Immupath project, the twenty remaining patients from the Phase I/II clinical trial will continue receiving treatment.  We have committed to manufacture a 24-month supply of Immupath anti-HIV plasma for these patients and are identifying community and private resources who may choose to undertake the continuing treatment of these patients.
<p>	The Board's decision to cease the Immupath project reaffirms our commitment to nationally expand our core blood products and services business.  In recent months, we have announced two expansion projects.

<ol><li>The University of Southern California (USC) Blood Center.  The Center, currently under construction, will initially serve USC University Hospital and the USC/Kenneth Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital both located on the USC Health Sciences campus in Los Angeles, CA.  We expect the center will open in February 1996 and to be fully operational by the end of the first quarter of 1996.<p>
<li>Gateway Community Blood Program (Gateway).  This full-service program will provide blood products and services to hospitals and patients in the greater St. Louis area.   The first Gateway location opened in December 1995 and will be fully operational by the second quarter of 1996.</ol>
<p>	Additional expansion opportunities are under consideration in areas where local health care entities have made inquiries about our services.  In addition, we are planning to add to our line of products and services by acquisition and internal development.
<p>	In early December, we filed an anti-trust and unfair competition complaint to recover damages and secure injunctive relief against the Los Angeles Region Blood Service of the American Red Cross (ARC).  It is our belief that the tiered pricing system implemented by the ARC, in which customers are given preferred pricing and other considerations only if they purchase at least 90% of their requirements for each type of  blood product from the ARC regardless of volume, compels hospitals to purchase blood products from the ARC at higher prices than those offered by HemaCare.  We believe that our customers should be able to freely choose blood providers on the basis of safety, price and service.
<p>	As always, we thank you, our shareholders, blood donors, employees and customers for your continued support and welcome your comments and suggestions.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

To Our Stockholders

<P>

For the three months ended September 30, 1996, HoloPak Technologies, Inc. had net loss of $232,000 or 7 cents per share, compared to a net income of $216,000, or 6 cents per share, for the comparable period last year.  For the six months ended September 30, 1995, HoloPak had net income of $15,000, or 0 cents per share, compared to $551,000, or 16 cents for the year earlier period.

<P>

Hot Stamping Foils & Metallized Paper Sales Weak

<P>

Sales for the quarter were weak in two key areas:  Hot stamping foils and metallized paper.

<P>

The decline in hot stamping foils was attributable to soft demand for graphics foils and foil laminated plastic sheets.

<P>

Metallized Paper sales suffered from slack demand in liquor and tobacco packaging.

<P>

<U>Holography Strong </U> <BR>
Holography sales, on the other hand, continued to show strength.  Year-to-date holographic revenues are $3.5 million, compared to $3.3 million in the prior year.  The increase is attributable to greater sales of holographic security foils.<P>
  <U>Hot Stamp Foil Production in Canada</U> <BR>
 Production efficiency in the manufacture of hot stamping foils also hurt margins.  The Company has embarked upon a  program of capital improvements intended to lower production costs and improve efficiency.  Also, we have begun the production of hot stamp foil at our facility in Montreal.  We believe that our costs will be significantly lower and our efficiencies significantly higher there.<P>
	<U>Annual Meeting</U>  <P>
The Company held its annual meeting on September 20, 1996.  Stockholders elected the following to one year terms as directors:  Robert J. Simon, Michael S. Mathews, John J. Collins, Brian Kelly, Cheryl A. Mills, Courtney M. Price, and Robert E. Coghan, and ratified the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent auditors. 
<P>
 We appreciate your continued interest and support.

<B>First Quarter Report 1996</B>

<P>



To our Shareholders:

<P>

HomeTown Buffet, Inc. reported net income of $1,755,000 for the sixteen weeks ended April 24, 1996, a 26% increase over the 1995 comparable sixteen-week period net income of $1,397,000.  Per share results amounted to $0.15 per common share for the first quarter of 1996 versus $0.12 per common share for the same period of 1995.  Total revenues for the quarter increased 60% to $61.7 million from $38.6 million in the same period of 1995, reflecting revenues generated by additional Company-owned restaurants and franchised HomeTown Buffet restaurants opened since the first quarter of fiscal 1995.

<P>

Six new restaurants were opened in the first quarter of 1996, consisting of five Company-owned HomeTown Buffet restaurants and one Roadhouse Grill restaurant.

<P>

Average weekly net restaurant sales amounted to $53,018 in the first quarter of 1996 versus $53,639 in the same period of the prior year, a 1.2% decrease.

<P>

During the first quarter of fiscal 1996 the Company purchased the minority interest of its one remaining joint venture.  The joint venture operated 10 restaurants in Illinois and Ohio.  The Company also completed negotiation of an amended credit-line with Sanwa Bank of California.  The two-year line of credit allows for borrowings of $10 million.

<P>

On June 4, 1996, the Company announced that it had signed a merger agreement with Buffets, Inc. ("Buffets"), an operator of approximately 250 buffet-style restaurants.  Under the merger agreement, the two companies will be joined through a merger of the Company into a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of Buffets.  The agreement further provides that the Company’s shareholders will receive 1.17 shares of Buffets common stock for each share of the Company’s common stock. 

<P>

Completion of the merger is subject to approvals by both Buffets and the Company’s shareholders, various regulatory approvals and certain other conditions.  It is expected that the merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests, and be tax free to the Company’s shareholders.  The parties expect to complete the merger by the end of the calendar year.

<P>

Based on 1995 results, the combined entity would be the 25th largest U.S. restaurant chain.   The Company believes that the merger offers substantial potential long-term benefits to its shareholders.

<CENTER><B>Hospitality Properties Trust Announces Third Quarter Operating Results</B></CENTER>

<P>

	Newton, MA...October 31, 1996...Hospitality Properties Trust (NYSE:HPT) today announced its financial results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.
<P>

	Total revenues for the quarter were $24,878,000, net income was $15,446,000 ($0.58/share) and cash available for distribution (CAD) was $17,876,000 ($0.67/share).
<P>

	Total revenues and net income for the first nine months of 1996 totaled $58,223,000 and $36,691,000 ($1.67/share), respectively. CAD for the nine months ended September 30, 1996, was $42,611,000 ($1.94/share).  Comparisons with historical results for the first nine months of 1995 are not meaningful because HPT commenced operations with its first hotel investments in March 1995, and did not become a publicly traded entity until August 1995.
<P>

	A spokesman for HPT pointed out that, as a REIT (a real estate investment trust), HPT considers cash available for distribution a better measure of its operating performance than net income as determined according to generally accepted accounting principles.  CAD is defined as net income, before non-recurring items, plus depreciation and other non-cash expenses, and less a reserve for renovations and property maintenance.

<P>

	John G. Murray, President of HPT, issued the following statement:

<P>

	"HPT’s financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 reflect a full quarter’s positive impact of $484 million of investments in 45 hotel properties completed in the first and second quarters of 1996. Percentage rent from our 53 Courtyard by Marriott® hotels have added $0.01/share to CAD this quarter and $0.04/share for the first nine months of 1996.  The leases for our Residence Inn by Marriott® and Wyndham Garden® investments entitle HPT to percentage rent beginning in 1997.

<P>

	"On August 22, 1996, HPT marked the first anniversary of its IPO with a portfolio that has grown to 82 high-quality hotels with an annual minimum rental base of over $81 million--more than double the number of hotels and rental base that existed a year earlier.  We have a large, diversified portfolio, a solid equity capital base and a low debt-to-equity ratio, all of which position us well for planned continued growth of our portfolio."

<P>

	Hospitality Properties Trust is a REIT headquartered in Newton, MA which invests in hotels.  HPT currently has investments of approximately $813 million in 82 hotels located in 26 states.
<P>

	This press release contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties.  Although HPT believes its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be provided that anticipated results will occur.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>To Our Valued Stockholders and Employees:</B>
<P>
	The first quarter of 1996 proved to be an important period in HPI’s development.  In this report, we will highlight the most significant accomplishments that have resulted in the reinforcement of our business strategy, the increase in the breadth of our scientific expertise, the progression of our internal discovery program and the strengthening of our financial position.

<P>
 	In February, HPI completed an agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO), a Denmark-based pharmaceutical company which specializes in insulin and diabetes care and also manufactures and markets a variety of other pharmaceutical products.   In this collaboration, Novo Nordisk and HPI will work together to identify drugs for the treatment of diabetes and osteoporosis. Novo Nordisk’s US research arm, ZymoGenetics, will obtain non-exclusive access to the HPI’s combinatorial chemistry libraries for its proprietary biological screens to discover lead compounds  in those therapeutic areas. HPI, in turn, will receive $4 million in research funding over 2 years, as well as potential milestone payments and royalties for any products that are discovered and commercialized. 

<P>
	Also in February, HPI finalized a research collaboration with Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: DURA) giving HPI access to Dura’s proprietary drug delivery technology.  The agreement included a $5 million equity investment by Dura in HPI. The research collaboration commits HPI to fund $6 million in Dura research over four years to apply Dura’s advanced drug delivery systems to HPI’s proprietary compounds.

<P>
	At the end of February, we announced the appointment of Mike Green, Ph.D. to the newly created position of Vice President, Chemistry.  In this position, Dr. Green is responsible for the technical leadership and expansion of HPI’s small molecule combinatorial chemistry program.  Dr. Green is an experienced pharmaceutical-industry chemist with several commercialized prescription drugs to his credit.

<P>
	The first quarter of 1996 marked continued progress in our internal discovery program. We received  clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to initiate a second Phase II clinical trial for our lead compound, HP 228.  HP 228 is now being evaluated in a  pilot trial for the management of patients with obesity and non-insulin dependent, or Type II, diabetes. The company believes this pilot trial should be completed in 1996.

<P>
	The company successfully completed a private round of financing  on February 7, as well as an initial public offering on March 29.  Through the offerings we raised in excess of $10 million and $27 million, respectively, in net proceeds.  The company plans to use these funds to expand our small-molecule combinatorial chemistry capabilities and to continue development of HP 228 and related compounds.

<P>

<I><B>Financial Review</B></I>
<P>

	Revenues for the first quarter were $1.6 million compared with revenues of $13,000 for the corresponding period in the previous year.  The increase in revenues resulted primarily from collaborative agreements related to our combinatorial libraries and the exclusion from the1995 first quarter figure revenues generated from our wholly owned subsidiary, Multiple Peptide Systems, Inc.

<P>
	The net loss for the first quarter was $1.8 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with a net loss of $1.6 million, or $0.17 per share, in the comparable period in 1995.  As of early April, after receipt of funds from the company’s initial public offering, HPI had approximately $36 million in cash and cash equivalents. 

<P>
	We thank our long-time investors and employees for their continued support and welcome those who became investors through the public offering.

<P>
Sincerely,

<CENTER><B>Third-Quarter Report 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>


<B>To Our Shareholders:</B>


<P>


On October 22, 1996, Houghton Mifflin Company reported record net sales and earnings for the third quarter of 1996.  Net sales totaled $356.7 million, a 33% increase over the $267.9 million reported in the third quarter of 1995, reflecting strong performance from its educational publishing operations.

<P>

Net earnings from operations in the third quarter of 1996 were $70.5 million, or $5.05 per share, compared to $59.2 million, or $4.29 per share, in the third quarter of 1995.  Including a $5.6 million gain related to the sale of INSO Corporation stock, net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $76.1 million, or $5.45 per share, compared to net income of $68.1 million, or $4.93 per share, in the third quarter of 1995, when a gain of $8.9 million related to INSO Corporation was recorded.

<P>

Our educational publishing divisions met our expectations in the third quarter, and we are very pleased with the results.  Each of our educational publishing divisions reported increased net sales and operating profits.  The Heath acquisition last year was a milestone for our Company.  It has enabled us to strengthen our position in educational publishing and provided us with new opportunities for growth; its integration into our existing operations is achieving the synergies we anticipated.  As a result of the acquisition, our core education business is extremely strong.  We believe that we are very well positioned to take advantage of adoption opportunities in 1997 and beyond.

<P>

The educational publishing 
segment reported third-quarter net sales of $334.3 million in 1996, a 39% increase over the previous year's third-quarter results of $240.5 million. Results for the third quarter of 1995 included $20 million of sales which had been delayed from the second quarter due to distribution problems.  Although adoption opportunities have been limited in 1996, both the School Division and McDougal Littell reported significant net sales increases, reflecting the acquisition of Heath and strong performance of new product offerings.  Driven by the addition of Heath product, College Division net sales rose 63% in the third quarter to $63.3 million from the $38.9 million reported in the third quarter of 1995.  The Riverside Publishing Company reported higher net sales than in the third quarter of 1995, and Great Source achieved substantial revenue growth.

<P>

As a result of the change in strategy and lower frontlist sales, the general publishing segment reported net sales of $22.4 million in the third quarter of 1996, down approximately 18% from the $27.4 million reported in the third quarter of 1995.  Houghton Mifflin Interactive's products have won market recognition, and four new products were shipped in the third quarter.

<P>



In the third quarter of 1996, the Company sold 200,000 shares of INSO Corporation common stock.  The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $9.6 million, or $.40 per share.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net sales increased 41% to $597.7 million from $423.1 million reported in the same period last year.  Excluding the gain reported on sale of INSO shares, net earnings from operations for the first nine months of 1996 were $45.4 million, or $3.26 per share, compared with $42.0 million, or $3.05 per share, in the first nine months of 1995.  Including special items in both years, net income for the nine-month period was $63.4 million, or $4.55 per share in 1996, compared with $44.4 million, or $3.22 per share, in the first nine months of 1995.

<P>

<B>Board Declares Quarterly Dividend</B><BR>

The Board of Directors of Houghton Mifflin Company has voted a quarterly dividend of $.24 per share, payable on November 27, 1996 to shareholders of record on November 13, 1996.
Net earnings from operations rose to $70.5 million in the third quarter of 1996 from $59.2 million in last year's third quarter.  Higher net sales and operating efficiencies achieved through the integration of Heath resulted in significantly increased profitability reported by all education businesses.  Selling and administrative expenses declined as a percent of sales and cost of sales increased only slightly due to higher plate amortization resulting from investment in new products to prepare for numerous adoption opportunities.

<P>

Respectfully submitted,

To Our Unitholders:

<P>

Better operating margins on all of our products, especially our light-end products, led Huntway to achieve a net profit of $1.25 million ($.11 per unit) in the second quarter.  Earnings before interest and depreciation were just over $3 million.  Sales increased 24% to more than $26 million for the quarter, while revenues for the first half of the year rose 30% to $43.3 million.  This year's weather has been drier and milder than a year ago, thus boosting sales of asphalt.

<P>

For the first half of 1996, the partnership's loss declined to $968,000 ($.08 per unit) from a loss of $5.67 million ($.49 per unit) a year earlier.  In the second quarter a year ago, we experienced a loss of $2.29 million ($.20 per unit).  Interest expense in the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 1996 were calculated on the basis of Huntway's existing debt structure.  Had our proposed debt restructuring agreements been in effect at the beginning of the year, interest expense would have been reduced by $470,000 in the second quarter and $924,000 during the first half of the year.

<P>

During the just completed quarter, prices for our light-end products increased commensurate with the dramatic rise in wholesale gasoline and diesel prices in California.  Asphalt prices in Southern California remain depressed.  However, our asphalt margins during the first half of this year have improved over the first two quarters of 1995, when California experienced record rainfall and we had to sell significant amounts of low-margin fuel oil.

<P>

As announced on July 24, we have filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with our previously disclosed debt restructuring plan.  Following the SEC's review, we expect to distribute definitive consent solicitation materials to our unitholders.  You will receive a mailing from us – including several ballots – describing in detail our plan to accomplish Huntway Partners, L.P.'s debt restructuring through a "prepackaged" reorganization plan filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court.  Please review the materials and return your ballots promptly by mail.

<P>

For a complete copy of the latest 10-Q, please write or call us at (805)286-1582.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER <BR>
AND YEAR END RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>


November 4, 1996 -- Hutchinson Technology Incorporated (Nasdaq/NMS:HTCH) today reported net income of $1,409,000, or $.25 per share, on net sales of $91,890,000 for the fourth quarter ended September 29, 1996 compared to net income of $8,661,000, or $1.55 per share, on net sales of $86,722,000 for the comparable fiscal 1995 period.  The company's fiscal 1996 fourth quarter was a 14-week period while the comparable fiscal 1995 quarter was a 13-week period.
<P>

For the fiscal year ended September 29, 1996, the company reported net income of $13,802,000, or $2.46 per share, on net sales of $353,186,000 compared to net income of $21,078,000, or $3.84 per share, on net sales of $299,998,000 for fiscal 1995.  Average weekly shipments of suspension assemblies for the entire fiscal year were 10.2 million compared to 7.6 million for fiscal 1995.  Results for fiscal 1996 and 1995 included, respectively, $.69 and $.31 per share charges against earnings reflecting recognition of fixed commitments to IBM under a technology sharing agreement.
<P>

Wayne M. Fortun, Hutchinson Technology’s chief executive officer, noted that the company’s average weekly shipments dropped from 11.2 million in the third fiscal quarter to 10.2 million in the fourth quarter due to a previously reported decline in demand.  However, for the first four weeks of fiscal 1997, average weekly shipments were 11.9 million suspensions.  Fortun attributed the decline in fourth quarter and fiscal year net earnings to the combined effects of the reduced demand, increased overhead resulting from additions to manufacturing capacity at the company’s Eau Claire, Wis. and Plymouth, Minn. plants, and increased costs related to accelerated development of the company’s TSATM products (suspension assemblies incorporating integrated electrical leads).  
<P>

Fortun said that in response to growing customer interest in its TSATM products, the company accelerated its development efforts and has been supplying parts at pre-production levels.  "Our TSATM products are gaining acceptance from our customers, and we expect to begin shipping qualified product to multiple customers within 90 days.  We expect to have capacity to produce over two million TSATM parts per week by the fall of 1997," said Fortun.
<P>

This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding demand for the company’s products and TSATM production capacity which involve risks and uncertainties.  The company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of  fluctuating order rates, slower or faster customer acceptance of its newer products, difficulties in expanding capacity, and the other factors described from time to time in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to its Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 1, 1996, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June  23, 1996.
<P>

Hutchinson Technology is the leading worldwide supplier of suspension assemblies for disk drives.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Dear Shareholder:


<P>
	We are making considerable progress in the introduction of Engelhard/ICC proprietary desiccant technology to the world market, and I would like to share with you a few thoughts following my recent trip to visit our distribution partners in Japan, Nichimen Corporation and Osaka Gas.

<P>

	As you know, we have been working in the Japanese market for several years with two of the most prestigious industrial organizations in that region.  Nichimen Corporation does $62 billion of revenues annually and Osaka Gas is Japan’s second largest gas company, selling several hundred million dollars worth of gas cooling equipment annually.  In addition, Osaka introduced the Gas Heat Pump technology into the Japanese market just four years ago and has built that into a several hundred million dollar annual market as well.  

<P>

	Most importantly, Osaka has found that the combination of our unit with a Yamaha gas heat pump creates a very competitive product versus electric units and feels that it can more than double the annual business it does in gas heat pumps if our desiccant systems are sold along with them in tandem.  There are currently six manufacturers of gas heat pumps which represent 30% of the market. 

<P>

	To spur market development, Osaka Gas is committing its 300 sales person force to marketing the Engelhard/ICC product line.  Our desiccant units are now appearing in Osaka’s catalogs which are used not only by its sales people but as a reference source by purchasers and specifiers.  

<P>

	During my visit, I had an opportunity to see our units in operation at the Sanyo Battery Factory and Osaka’s Gas Library.  They are also installed in a nursing home, a gambling hall and a food processing plant.  These beta sites for our units all reported extremely satisfactory results and should prove to be strong reference points for others interested in seeing these units at work in varying capacities under some very difficult conditions.

<P>

	Osaka Gas has several times showcased our desiccant cooling systems at industrial shows, both as a stand alone and as a companion to a Yamaha gas heat pump.  

<P>

	Nichimen has placed a number of our units in the most difficult settings possible and they have performed superbly well.  As an example, there are some 18,000 pachinko halls (gambling parlors) in Japan and generally they are utilized by heavy smoking customers.  The utilization of the Engelhard/ICC desiccant systems in this environment has proved enormously beneficial and results in air quality improvement have been spectacular.  

<P>

	As a result of the excellent performance of our units in these difficult environments, Nichimen has now invested a significant amount of money in building a marketing and technical team to represent us in Japan.  On our side, Engelhard/ICC has developed special equipment geared towards the Japanese market and we are now well poised to take advantage of the excellent opportunities in Japan.

<P>

	The Japanese air conditioning market is the world’s largest with annual sales of about $12 billion, representing more than 40% of the world air conditioning market.  The Japanese market is expected to grow by the year 2000 to annual sales of more than $15 billion, a 25% increase in just four years.  Your management believes that the Engelhard/ICC desiccant technology will play an important role in the growth of the Japanese market.

<P>

	In addition to the significant progress we are making in Japan, we recently announced our joint market development agreement with Carrier Asia Pacific Operations, granting Carrier APO exclusivity in much of the Asian region except Japan and Taiwan.  Carrier, as you probably know, is the world’s largest manufacturer and distributor of air conditioning systems and the ability of Engelhard/ICC to move aggressively forward in conjunction with Carrier is a milestone event in our corporate history.  In conjunction with Nichimen, Osaka Gas and Carrier,  other international names who have endorsed and joined Engelhard/ICC in the introduction of our unique technology include Samsung in Korea and Chung-Hsin in Taiwan, the largest air conditioner manufacturer in that large market place.  These important and instantly recognizable companies represent a unique platform from which to build an enterprise which we believe will result, in several years, in a company with annual sales of hundreds of millions of dollars with high profit margins, rewarding those shareholders who have patiently supported this management in the creation of this exciting opportunity.

<P>

We will continue to report to you on our progress.

<P>

Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>

IFR Systems will begin distributing quarterly reports in this new format to provide all shareholders with financial information in the most timely and cost efficient manner.

<P>

<CENTER><B>FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 1997</B></CENTER>

<P>

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

	The new fiscal year is off to a strong start as net income for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 ended September 30, 1996 nearly tripled to $1,210,000, or $.21 per share, from $408,000, or $.07 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Revenue for the period increased 17% to $23,258,000 from $19,857,000 for last year’s first quarter.
<P>

	Sales by the Company’s RF Division increased 18% for the first quarter, primarily reflecting a 42% increase in sales of wireless telecommunications test equipment to commercial customers and a decline in sales of government communications test sets as anticipated in the period.  IFR’s Fiber Optics division posted a 16% sales gain for the first quarter compared to last year.
<P>

	Gross margin improved to 38% of revenue for this year’s first quarter compared to 36% a year ago.  Operating income rose to 8.6% of revenue compared to 4.1% for the same period of the prior year.  These improvements in revenue and profitability, which are consistent with our strategic plan, reflect continued strong business conditions in our core wireless telecommunications and fiber optics test equipment markets as well as a variety of operational enhancements that have improved efficiency and reduced operating costs.
<P>

	Based on our current assessment of business conditions in our key markets, we are optimistic that IFR will continue to perform well for the balance of the fiscal year.
<P>

	At September 30, 1996, IFR Systems reported working capital of $26,512,000, a current ratio of 2.8-to-1, long-term debt and capital lease obligations totaling $2,691,000, and shareholders’ equity of $42,490,000.
<P>

	Thank you for your interest and support.<P>

	<CENTER><B>ILC TECHNOLOGY, INC. ANNOUNCES FISCAL 1996 <BR>
	YEAR END AND FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING <BR>
	RESULTS. BOARD AUTHORIZES STOCK<BR>
 	REPURCHASE PROGRAM.</B></CENTER>
<P>

	Henry Baumgartner, Chairman and Chief Executive Office of ILC Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILCT) today announced operating results for the Company’s fiscal year ended September 28, 1996.  The fiscal 1996 results include a $4,239,000 charge for discontinued operations as it relates to the Precision Lamp (PLI) operations.  The Company has decided to sell the PLI business within the next year because of the negative impact on earnings and cash flows for the last two years.

<P>

	Sales for the fiscal year ended September 28, 1996 increased to $54,206,000, compared to $49,496,000, as restated for the effect of the discontinued operations, reported in fiscal 1995.  Net income for the twelve month period from continuing operations was $4,546,000 or $.92 per share compared to net income of $4,637,000 or $.97 per share in the same period a year ago.  Net income for fiscal 1996 includes a net loss from discontinued operations (PLI) of $4,239,000 or $.86 per share and for fiscal 1995 includes $99,000 or $.02 per share.

<P>

	Fiscal 1996 fourth quarter sales were $13,193,000 as compared to $13,878,000, as restated, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.  The Company had fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $949,000 or $.19 per share in fiscal 1996 as compared to income from continuing operations, as restated, of $1,534,000 or $.32 per share in fiscal 1995.

<P>

	Mr. Baumgartner also reported that the Company’s Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of its 4.8 million common shares outstanding.  Purchases will be made on the open market from time to time over the next two years.  The actual number of shares that ILC will purchase will depend on the prevailing market conditions.  Share repurchases will be funded from existing cash, internally generated funds or through short-term debt.  Any shares repurchased will be retired.  Mr. Baumgartner said the action was part of a continuing effort to increase shareholder value.

<P>

	ILC Technology, Inc., develops, manufactures and distributes replaceable high-performance light source products for the medical, industrial, communication, aerospace, military, and entertainment industries.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>ICU MEDICAL, INC. REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY EARNINGS</B></CENTER>

<P>

<B>February 7, 1996, San Clemente, California</B> -- ICU Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ/ NMS -- ICUI), the San Clemente based maker of needleless medical devices, reported a 126% increase in net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1995 compared to the same period last year.  Net income increased to $1,649,000 for the quarter compared to $729,000 for the same period last year. 
<P>

	According to William Moore, ICU’s Chief Financial Officer, "the Company’s strong earnings growth was driven by higher gross profit margins compared to the fourth quarter last year.  Gross margins increased to 60% in the fourth quarter compared to 38% last year.  Overhead expenses continued to decline while automated molding and assembly processes were expanded.  Overhead decreased from approximately $1,613,000 or 32% of sales during the fourth quarter last year to approximately $1,272,000 or 24% of sales this year.  Also, certain start up costs associated with Clave® incurred last year did not recur.  Additionally, the Company recorded a one time state tax credit of approximately $350,000 during the fourth quarter this year related to past investments in manufacturing equipment."

<P>

	ICU’s sales growth continues to be driven by sales of Clave® to specialty distributors and McGaw Laboratories, Inc.  According to Moore, "we are very pleased with the success our specialty distributors and McGaw are having with Clave® and are looking forward to initial shipments to Abbott Laboratories, Inc., scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 1996 under a supply and distribution agreement signed recently.  We are proceeding with our plans to add the necessary sales resources to manage this diversified distribution network.  Although Abbott and McGaw provide significant distribution muscle, we believe there is ample opportunity for specialty distributors to gain market share.  As such, we are expanding the number of specialty distributors, both in the states and abroad."

<P>

	Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 1995 due to a common stock offering completed in July 1995, in which the Company issued 1,460,000 common shares.

<CENTER><B>IDAHO POWER REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS</B></CENTER>

<P>

 	BOISE, Idaho -- As expected, Idaho Power’s third quarter earnings are down from last year’s record levels as a result of relatively flat operating revenues, increased operating expenses and a more normal effective income tax rate.
<P>

	Earnings on common stock were $17.2 million or 46 cents per share, compared with $21.8 million or 58 cents per share in 1995’s strong third quarter.  However, earnings through the first nine months of 1996 were $1.77 per share, 28 cents more than last year at this time.
<P>

	The economy of our service territory continues to grow and as a result so does our customer base.  During July, August and September we added 3,496 general business customers to our system, bringing our total customer count to 349,270.
<P>

	Despite the growth in customer numbers, revenues for the quarter were up only $1.0 million over 1995’s third quarter to $149.7 million.  Revenues were flat, despite increased sales, because of the $26 million PCA rate reduction in May and the recording of a provision for rate refund pursuant to the Company’s regulatory compact in Idaho.  General business revenues showed a slight increase in most areas, the most notable being irrigation revenues, which were up 5.3 percent over 1995’s third quarter because of warmer, drier weather conditions.  Another revenue increase came in the area of surplus sales which were $3.1 million, up $2.3 million from last year.  
<P>

	Fuel expenses increased $5.4 million during the quarter mainly due to the operation of the Valmy coal-fired power plant following this summer’s regional transmission line outages which affected several western states’ power supplies.  The Company operated Valmy for a period of time during peak load periods for voltage and reactive support of  the Company’s transmission grid.
<P>

	Purchased power expenses also were up $5.4 million during the quarter due to economy purchases the Company made on the regional energy market at times when it was less expensive to buy than to generate.  
<P>

	Other operating expenses increased by $6.2 million over last year’s third quarter primarily due to costs associated with maintenance of the Company’s electric system, tax and regulatory charges related to increased hydro generation and increased consulting services.  Other income and deductions decreased by $1.1 million primarily due to decreased coal sales at the IERCo subsidiary and because last year’s third quarter included income from a substation construction project.  
<P>

	Income taxes were down in total but did not fall proportionately to income since 1995 results included nearly $1.0 million of prior year tax return adjustments which lowered the effective tax rate.  
<P>

	The Company also added to a reserve for possible rate refunds for Idaho customers.  The reserve has been established in anticipation of the Company’s earnings exceeding the 11.75 percent threshold through the end of 1996.  Should the Company’s earnings continue, the customers’ share of the excess earnings will be refunded in 1997 in conjunction with the annual power cost adjustment mechanism.

I am pleased to report that for the quarter ending September 30, 1996, IDEXX revenues increased to $69.8 million, representing a 43% increase from the third quarter of 1995. Net income increased 59% to $8.6 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $5.4 million, or $0.16 per share, in the same quarter in 1995.
<P>
For the nine months ending September 30, 1996, revenues increased 44% to $193.1 million and net income increased 63%. International revenues increased 47% in the first nine months of 1996 to $66.8 million, compared to $45.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 1996, was $23.4 million, or $0.59 per share, compared to $14.4 million, or $0.42 per share, for the same period in 1995.
<P>
Our increase in revenues for the third quarter of 1996 compared to the same period in 1995 is principally attributable to increased sales of the veterinary laboratory services resulting from recent acquisitions of veterinary reference laboratories, veterinary clinical chemistry consumables, and test kits for canine heartworm. The increase in revenues for the first nine months of 1996 compared to the same period in 1995 are attributable to increases in sales of veterinary clinical chemistry consumables, veterinary laboratory services, canine test products, and a quantitative thyroid instrument introduced in the first quarter of 1996.
<P>
During the quarter, we completed previously announced acquisitions of three companies:	
<OL>
<LI>Consolidated Veterinary Diagnostics, Inc., a veterinary reference laboratory headquartered in West Sacramento, California;	
<LI>Idetek, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of diagnostic tests for food, agricultural and environmental applications, located in 		Sunnyvale, California; and	
<LI>Ubitech Aktiebolag, a manufacturer and distributor of livestock diagnostic kit products, located in Uppsala, Sweden.
</OL>
<P>

We continue to pursue opportunities consistent with our goal of being a great company in the eyes of our employees, customers and stockholders.
<P>

<CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER 1996 RESULTS</B></CENTER>


<P>

 SAN JOSE, Calif., October 10, 1996 ISD (Information Storage Devices, Inc.) (NASDAQ:ISDI) announced today that its net revenue for the third quarter ended September 28, 1996 was $8.2 million.  This compares to net revenue of $15.5 million for the third quarter of 1995.  The net loss for the period was $5.7 million, or $.59 per share.  The loss includes inventory reserves of approximately $1.6 million before taxes and the reversal of tax benefits from prior periods of approximately $1.0 million, which together accounted for approximately $.26 per share of the net loss for the period.  Net income for last year’s third quarter was $1.7 million, or $.19 per share.
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 28, 1996, ISD reported a net loss of $7.5 million, or $.76 per share, on net revenue of $31.7 million.  This compares to net income of $4.1 million, or $.49 per share, on net revenue of $42.8 million for the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

	"As we announced on September 17, 1996, third quarter results were adversely affected by significant unanticipated order stretch-outs by a major customer in the communications industry, particularly for applications in cell phone handsets," said David L. Angel, president and chief executive officer.  He said that, to a lesser extent, results for the period also reflect anticipated price reductions and continued softness in demand for ISD's ChipCorder® single-chip integrated circuit products for voice recording and playback among consumer-oriented accounts.
	
<P>
Angel said that production of 0.8 micron wafers by the Company's foundry has now been qualified, and production of ChipCorder® products based on this technology has begun.  He said that the foundry has stopped shipping 1.2 micron wafers.  "ISD's new ISD33000 series, the industry's first 3-volt, single-chip record and playback products with recording times up to four minutes are expected to begin shipping as planned in the fourth quarter," he added.
	
<P>
At September 28, 1996, ISD reported cash and investments of $54.1 million, inventory of $14.0 million, no debt, and shareholders' equity of $70.9 million, or $7.34 per share.
	
<P>
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding shipment of product.  Actual results could differ materially as a result of a number of factors including the following: cyclical nature of the markets and demand for the company’s products; fluctuations in manufacturing yields; competitive pricing pressures; the timing of orders; changes in the mix of products sold; changes in the mix of customers; availability and cost of products from the Company's suppliers; the timing of new product announcements; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; the gain or loss of significant customers; economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas; and the risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including but not limited to its report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995 and the Company's 1995 Annual Report

<P>


	San Jose, California, July 25, 1996 -- IMPACT SYSTEMS, INC.  (OTC:  MPAC) reported today that for its first quarter ended June 30, 1996 it had a net profit of $403,000 on net revenues of $5.2 Million.  This compares to a profit of $305,000 on revenues of $3.7 Million for the comparable quarter last year.

<P>

	Mr. Kenneth P. Ostrow, President and CEO, stated, "Impact’s revenues and profits were up 40% and 31%, respectively over the comparable quarter of fiscal 1996.  Spending was up 25% as we have invested in our sales, service and marketing groups as an associated part of our goal to increase revenues.

<P>

	This quarter’s revenues include an increasing number of AdvantagePlus™ sensor systems as this segment has become more successful and an increasing part of our business.  The success of this segment of our product line not only increases our overall market potential, but also generates additional opportunities for our associated actuator products.  As these AdvantagePlus™ systems are installed the positive references from users significantly increase our ability to gain market share."

<P>

	Mr. Ostrow went on to say, "The Company’s financial plan is predicated on a continued increase in sensor based systems in North America and the continued strength of such in the Asian market. 

<P>

	The paper industry, which has always been notoriously cyclical, has recently been going through volatility of a magnitude which is almost unprecedented.  After what has been quoted by our customers as the shortest lived recovery in the history of the paper industry, paper prices tumbled and the industry has recently reported dramatically reduced earnings, and many have delayed their capital improvements.  This has also put pressure on our sales and prices.  However, many industry experts are already saying the worst is behind them and that prices have firmed or even increased, which would make it the shortest lived downturn in the history of the industry.

<P>

	Based on the conflicting benefits of recent AdvantagePlus™ sales combined with the pressures of a volatile market, we anticipate revenues to be up on a comparable basis with earnings to be relatively flat, as a result of somewhat lower margins and increased spending for the first six months of this fiscal year." 

<P>

Note: Certain of the statements contained in this news release are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s actual performance will meet Company’s expectations.  Specific risks are discussed in the Company’s Form 10-K for fiscal 1996 as filed with the SEC.

<P>

<B>Dear Stockholder:</B>

<P>

InControl continues to set the agenda for developing devices for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).  The third quarter echoed the theme of leadership in treating AF, with the introduction of the next generation atrial defibrillator--the METRIXTM 3020, the presentation of METRIX System clinical data at the European Society of Cardiology, the expansion of METRIX investigational centers, and the addition of temporary catheters for the treatment of AF as a business opportunity for InControl.  For the past five years, we have worked on the concept of an atrial defibrillator. Today the concept is a reality, and we welcome the opportunity to treat patients and allow them to take control of their lives.
<P>

<B>METRIX 3020--THE NEXT GENERATION</B>
<P>

In August, we submitted applications to the various regulatory authorities in the US and Europe to begin clinical investigation of our next-generation atrial defibrillator--the METRIX 3020.  We currently have approval in several countries and we expect to begin trials shortly in the US.  The METRIX 3020 has a larger capacitor and the ability to deliver a wider defibrillation pulse than the METRIX 3000.  The METRIX 3020 device can produce an energy output of up to 6 joules, more than double the METRIX 3000, and, at every energy level, the voltage required for atrioversion will be less than with the METRIX 3000. These changes should allow two outcomes: a greater number of patients who may respond to implant therapy due to higher energy output, and improved tolerance of the therapy due to the use of lower voltages.
<P>

<B>METRIX SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND INVESTIGATIONAL CENTER EXPANSION</B>
<P>

In late August, at the European Society of Cardiology annual scientific meeting, the METRIX System early clinical data were presented.  In a plenary session to more than 3,000 European cardiologists, Professor A. John Camm, MD, reviewed the current status of the clinical trial to date.  The METRIX System continues to perform as designed.  We have observed no safety issues, and the therapy at this stage of the investigation appears to be well tolerated.  At present, over twenty patients have been implanted with METRIX defibrillators, with a mean follow-up of more than three months.  We anticipate approval for commercial release of the METRIX 3020 in Europe during the first part of 1997.  During the quarter, InControl received approval from regulatory authorities in Europe to expand the number of centers where the METRIX system may be used.  Additionally, we intend to expand from three to five centers in the US within the next few weeks.
<P>

<B>TEMPORARY ATRIAL DEFIBRILLATION CATHETERS</B>
<P>

During the quarter we developed and obtained distribution rights to a set of catheters that can be used for internal atrial defibrillation in a variety of clinical settings. In the fourth quarter, we will introduce into European clinical centers a new single-pass, dual-shock temporary catheter--the TADCATHTM--that will be used for internal atrial defibrillation.  In a recent study published in the British journal Heart, 11 patients, who had been in AF for a mean of 233 days and had failed external cardioversion at 360 joules, underwent internal catheter atrial defibrillation.  Eight of the eleven were successfully converted using energies of 6.2 joules or less utilizing this technique.  We believe the use of these catheters will provide a valuable tool for the cardiologist in terminating AF as well as create a patient population pool for future METRIX defibrillator patients.  In order to broaden our product line in this area, we have entered into an agreement with EP MedSystems to distribute their ALERT catheter system in Europe.  This catheter can be used in a different clinical setting from the TADCATH for catheter-based treatment of AF.
<P>

<B>FINANCIAL RESULTS</B>
<P>

InControl recorded product sales for the quarter of $90,000, bringing the year to date 1996 revenues to just under $200,000.  This compares with no revenues in the first nine months of 1995.  The investment required to enter the active implantable device market is high, and in the quarter ending September 30, 1996, the Company had a loss of $6.7 million, bringing the loss for the year to date period to $21 million.  InControl ended the quarter with $44.4 million in cash.
<P>

<B>SUMMARY</B>
<P>

We clearly have established ourselves as the leader in the development of this therapy to treat atrial fibrillation. While no other company has yet brought a device to the clinic, we have already introduced our second generation product--the METRIX 3020.  We have established a platform from which additional therapeutic products can be developed to meet the needs of an expanding subset of AF patients.  The AF patient deserves better therapy, and we intend to fulfill that need. We are pleased with our progress and the milestones we have achieved, as we prepare for a dynamic 1997.

<B>1996 Third Quarter Report<BR>
November 1996</B>

<P>

Dear Shareholders:INCSTAR Corporation reported earnings of $986,000, or $0.06 per share, for the third quarter ended September 27, 1996, compared with earnings of $1.1 million or $0.07 per share, for the same period one year ago.  Despite flat results for the quarter, the  Company  achieved  a 20 percent  increase in earnings for its first 
nine months with earnings of $3.3  million, or $0.20 per share, compared with $2.7 million, or $0.17 per share, for the same period last year.

<P>

Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 were $10.6 million, compared with $11.7 million for the third quarter of 1995.  For the nine-month period, net sales were $33.4 million in 1996, compared with $33.8 million last year.  International sales grew 4 percent during the third quarter, principally due to improved performance in the Company’s infectious disease and serum protein product segments.  This increase was offset by a decline in domestic sales, reflecting the February 1996 re-entry into the market of a competitors hepatitis products.  This product line had been unavailable since July, 1995, creating an unusually strong demand for INCSTAR’s products during that period.  This situation is expected to continue to impact domestic sales for the remainder of 1996.

<P>

INCSTAR’s gross profit margin of 51.7 percent of net sales for the 1996 third quarter compared favorably with 50.3 percent of net sales last year.  Increased sales and marketing expenditures tied to the recent launch of several new products and a growing investment in our research and development programs led to higher operating expenses for the third quarter and nine months compared with the same periods in 1995.  While quarterly results were not as strong as we had anticipated, we are pleased with the earnings trend we have established for the first nine months and we expect to make continued progress during the remaining months of the year.

<P>

I am pleased to report that INCSTAR received FDA approval in September for its 25-OH-D RIA assay.  This approval is particularly significant because ours is the first test method on the market that has been cleared by the FDA for the detection of 25-Hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OH-D) to determine vitamin D levels in the bloodstream.  The measurement of 25-OH-D is becoming an increasingly important tool to determine levels of vitamin D, which is necessary for the body’s metabolism of calcium.  This information is extremely important for the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of various disorders of calcium metabolism, such as osteoporosis.  Osteoporosis is a disease that results in painful and debilitating bone fractures and is considered a major public health threat for 25 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women.

<P>

We remain steadfast in our goal of growing our business through the development of a wide range of new, innovative diagnostic products such as the 25-OH-D.  While we continue to experience sales erosion in some of our radioimmunoassay products (tests which use small amounts of radioactive materials to measure diagnostic results), product sales in several of our key markets, including bone and mineral metabolism and infectious and autoimmune diseases, continue to improve.  In addition, the Company currently has more than 20 new products in various stages of the development cycle, some of which are waiting to receive FDA approval.  We look forward to new opportunities for future growth as these new products are released to the market.

<P>

	As we begin our final quarter of fiscal 1996, we will continue to focus on ways to improve our internal processes to ensure we are working efficiently and providing the highest quality products available.  At the same time, we are expanding and restructuring our North American sales force to enhance direct contacts with our customers and strengthen our market presence.  It is our ongoing commitment to build long-term customer relationships and find better ways to address the needs of the individuals we serve.  Thank you for your continuing support and partnership in that effort.

<P>

Sincerely,

<CENTER><B>1996 THIRD QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>


<P>

<B>DEAR SHAREHOLDER:</B>

	
<P>
On November 18, the Company announced important management changes.  Jerome Kalishman, formerly Vice Chairman of the Board, was elected Chairman, succeeding James D. Krugman.  Anthony W. Hooper, formerly Senior Vice President - Marketing & Technology, was elected President and Chief Executive Officer, replacing Jean-Paul Richard, who resigned to become President and Chief Executive Officer of AGCO Corporation.  We are sorry to see J-P leave the Company but believe that the management team will continue the progress heretofore made and allow us to realize the full benefits from last year's merger with Insituform Mid-America, Inc.
	
<P>
Turning to the third quarter, the disappointing results are in large measure the direct consequence of the strategy adopted earlier in the year to address aggressively the competitive situation in our core municipal sewer market.  Our backlog of work, either under contract or for which the Company was low bidder, started to build up early in the quarter and reached a record level on September 30.  Not unexpectedly, however, margins suffered as a result of this strategy and were further weakened by some installation difficulties experienced during the quarter.

<P>
	For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, total revenues were $70,647,000, up 1.1% from 1995 third quarter revenues of $69,893,000.  Construction revenue increased 3.1% to $66,994,000 for the period as compared to $64,957,000 for the same period last year, while product sales revenue decreased 23.6% to $2,626,000 from $3,438,000 during the same period last year.
	
<P>
Net income in the third quarter of 1996 was $3,416,000 or $.13 per share as compared to $4,223,000 or $.15 per share during the same period last year.  The October 1995 combination with Insituform Mid-America, Inc. ("IMA") has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, ITI's financial information gives retroactive effect to the transaction, as if ITI and IMA had operated as a single entity for the periods presented.
	
<P>
For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, total revenues were $210,526,000 as compared to $201,780,000 in the first nine months of 1995.  Net income was $9,496,000 or $.35 per share, in the first nine months of 1996 as compared to $9,786,000 or $.36 per share in the same period last year.  Net income in 1995 reflects an after-tax expense of $2,188,000 or $.08 per share, related to the settlement of certain litigation.  Results of operations reflect the impact of the April 1995 acquisition of Insituform Southeast, Inc. and affiliates, which contributed revenues of $23,573,000 and $14,448,000, respectively, to the nine-month periods in 1996 and 1995.
	
<P>
Given our management changes, current backlog and many planned cost-saving actions, we are confident about the coming year and look forward to achieving operating results which meet our shareholders' expectations.

<P>

Sincerely yours,
<P>

	<CENTER><B>1997 FIRST QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>
	

<P>


To Our Shareholders:
	
<P>
IPEC recorded revenues of $32 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1997, down 16%  from the $38 million reported in the first quarter last year.  There was a net loss of $3.5 million, or $.23 per share, on 14.8 million weighted average shares outstanding in the first quarter, compared to net income of $3.2 million, or $.20 per share, on 16.3 million primary shares outstanding in the same prior-year period.
	
<P>
We were disappointed with the results for the first quarter, which reflected a shortfall in revenues from sulfuric acid reprocessors at IPEC Clean, and plasma jet systems at IPEC Precision.  Due to the current slowdown in the semiconductor industry, backlog at September 30, 1996 was approximately $45 million.  If current conditons continue, we expect that revenues for fiscal 1997 will decline from the $184.5 million recorded for the June 1996 fiscal year.  The gross margin in the first quarter was lower, primarily because of the allocation of higher levels of customer service expenditures across a lower revenue base, costs related to repositioning the Avanti 672 as described below, and a higher percentage of sales through international distributors, where margins are lower, as well as a charge for warrants which is discussed in the following paragraph. Efforts to reduce costs continue:  as part of our focus on our core CMP (chemical-mechanical planarization) business, which accounted for approximately 88% of revenues in the quarter, the Company has initiated a work force reduction, primarily at the non-CMP related subsidiaries and in product development. 
	
<P>
In the first quarter, we also recorded a $650,000 increase in the cost of goods sold related to warrants issued to a major customer in connection with an agreement permitting the Company to accelerate certain deliveries in the first, second and third quarters of the current fiscal year.   This arrangement is intended to achieve manufacturing efficiencies by more fully utilizing IPEC Planar’s Phoenix employees, currently trained to  manufacture older CMP machines scheduled for delivery to the client in fiscal 1997 and 1998, until the Company makes the transition to volume manufacturing of the AvantGAARD 676 in Phoenix rather than Portland.  The rescheduled orders accounted for approximately 20% of revenues in the first quarter.  The Company is committed to issue warrants through the third quarter of this fiscal year to purchase an aggregate minimum of 155,000 shares (of which warrants to purchase 60,000 shares have been issued), and an aggregate maximum of 250,000 shares of Common Stock.  
	
<P>
Management has made a strategic decision to focus IPEC’s process and applications engineering, in the near term, on our advanced high-throughput CMP tool, the AvantGAARD 676. To date, the 676 has been used only for metal polishing.  We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of polishing oxide layers with the 676; this oxide process is presently being qualified by several leading semiconductor manufacturers.  In the near term, the Avanti 672, which will integrate wafer cleaning, is being repositioned for use primarily in polishing 12-inch silicon wafers, and also for potential use in CMP by the few customers who may prefer the 672’s hard platen-based technology. 
<P>

	Thank you for your support and interest.  Right now, we cannot give assurances that the Company will be profitable in the second quarter.  We will keep you posted with regard to IPEC’s operations and industry conditions.

<P>

Sincerely,

<P>

<P>
<I>
This letter contains forward-looking statements, such as statements concerning future revenues, the Company's product strategy and the  ability to achieve manufacturing efficiencies, and may be deemed to include customer acceptance of the AvantGAARD 676 for polishing oxide and the Avanti 672 for silicon wafer polishing.  Future revenues depend on semiconductor industry conditions, customer orders and competitive pressures.  Customers have the right to cancel or delay orders without penalty or with limited penalties, and accordingly, past orders may not generate future revenues.  The semiconductor industry is at an early stage in adopting advanced CMP equipment, and development of alternative technologies or equipment could adversely affect the rate at which the Company's CMP solutions are adopted. Achieving manufacturing efficiencies depends on acceleration of certain deliveries by a major customer, retraining of IPEC Planar Phoenix employees and successful development and manufacturing of the AvantGAARD 676.  Customer acceptance of the AvantGAARD 676 and the Avanti 672 depends on qualifying the 676 for the oxide process and the availability of competitive products or alternative technologies.  This is only a summary of some of the important factors that could cause actual results to vary from the projections.  For a more complete description of these factors, refer to "Risk Factors" and  "Factors Affecting Future Operating Results" in the Company's annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</I>

<blockquote><CENTER><B><U>INSTEEL INDUSTRIES REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS</U></B></CENTER>

<P>

MOUNT AIRY, N.C., October 18, 1996 -- Insteel Industries, Inc. (NYSE:III), a major producer of wire products, today reported that fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose to $2.0 million, or 24 cents a share, from $30,000, or one cent a share, for the same period last year. Sales increased nine percent to $72.5 million from $66.4 million a year ago.

<P>

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 1996, net earnings totaled $4.2 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $6.3 million, or 76 cents a share for the prior year. The 1995 results included a $2.4 million, or 28 cents a share, one-time gain related to the future utilization of tax benefits arising from Insteel's acquisition of the remaining 30 percent interest in Insteel Construction Systems. Sales for fiscal 1996 increased two percent to $266.8 million from $260.3 million a year ago.

<P>

"Insteel's fourth-quarter results reflect stronger market conditions for most of our product lines which led to record shipments," said H.O. Woltz III, Insteel president and chief executive officer. "Wire product shipments rose 11 percent from the year-ago period, surpassing the previous record established in the third quarter.

<P>

"The July price increases that impacted a large proportion of our raw materials compressed margins early in the quarter," Woltz continued. "We are now beginning to recover a portion of these additional costs through higher selling prices on certain products. However, price competition continues to be fierce.

<P>

"Insteel's PC strand operation attained record sales volumes for the quarter and continued to generate significant operating earnings," Woltz said. "PC strand sales for fiscal 1996 increased 17 percent from last year as a result of strong market demand and our growing reputation as the industry's quality leader. We recently completed the expansion of our manufacturing facility with the start-up of a second production line that should generate an immediate contribution to Insteel's profitability. 

<P>

"Operating levels at the new collated nail facility will accelerate in the first quarter with the start-up of additional equipment," Woltz continued. "Although the collated initiative reduced fiscal 1996 earnings by seven cents a share, we have made steady progress in ramping up production volumes and generated operating income for the first time in the month of September.

<P>

"We continue to proceed on schedule with our plans to enter the tire reinforcement business with start-up targeted for the second quarter of fiscal 1997," Woltz said. "Construction is underway to reconfigure our Fredericksburg, Virginia plant into a state-of-the-art tire bead manufacturing facility. We have already begun shifting production volume from the Virginia facility to other manufacturing locations which will have a favorable impact on our overall operating efficiencies when the transition is completed."

<P>

Insteel Construction Systems, which manufactures the Insteel 3-D® building panel, continued to operate below its break-even level in the fourth quarter.

<P>

Insteel Industries produces concrete reinforcing products, industrial wire, agricultural fencing, nails and the Insteel 3-D building panel. The company operates plants in seven states and Mexico.

<blockquote>To Our Stockholders:

<P>

In December 1995, Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. undertook an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange to raise capital for planned growth.  Intercargo participated in the offering by selling 660,000 shares to fund expansion of its U.S. operations and entry into Hong Kong.  As a result, Kingsway is no longer a majority owned subsidiary of Intercargo and its results of operations and financial position are not consolidated with Intercargo at September 30, 1996.  Prior year amounts were not restated and include Kingsway on a consolidated basis.

<P>

Earned premium for U.S. and U.K. operations increased $4.4 million or 10.8% in the first nine months of 1996 as compared to 1995.  Included in the current quarter results is a reduction of $1.4 million in premium as
a result of retrospective reinsurance premiums.  Consolidated premiums for the first nine months of 1996 decreased $19.8 million compared to the same period in 1995.  The 1995 earned premium includes $24.2 million related to Kingsway.  Loss and loss adjustment expenses for U.S. and U.K. operations for the first nine months of 1996 increased $4.1 million or 21.3% over the same period in 1995.  Current quarter results include a reserve strengthening of $350,000 in the professional liability line as prior years development has exceeded expectations.  Earlier in the year marine reserves were strengthened by $1 million for similar reasons.  The use of more conservative loss reserving factors across all lines of business also contributed to the increase.  Consolidated loss and loss adjustment expenses for the first nine months of 1996 decreased 34.2% to $23.1 million from the same period in 1995.  The 1995 loss and loss adjustment expenses include $16.1 million attributable to Kingsway.  U.S. and U.K. policy acquisition costs increased $2.6 million or 25% during the first nine months of 1996.  This increase is due to increased premium volume and a lower deferral rate due to the more conservative loss reserving factors.  Consolidated policy acquisition costs for the first nine months of 1996 decreased $1.9 million as compared to 1995.  Included in the policy acquisition costs for 1995 is $4.5 million attributable to Kingsway.  Other underwriting expenses increased $1.5 million during the first nine months of 1996 after excluding $2.9 million of Kingsways expenses in 1995.  Approximately $750,000 of the increase is due to the expanding operations in Hong Kong.  Consolidated net income for the first nine months of 1996, including the pro-rata share of Kingsway earnings, decreased 38.7% to $3.5 million.  Earnings per share were $0.46 for the first nine months of 1996 as compared to $0.75 for the first nine months of 1995.  There were approximately 7.7 million shares outstanding during both periods for purposes of computing earnings per share.

<P>

The Company’s total assets at September 30, 1996 increased to $124.8 million from $116.2 million at December 31, 1995.  Stockholders’ equity has increased to $44.9 million at September 30, 1996 from $43.6 million at December 31, 1995.  Net income exceeded the decline in market value of the investment portfolio and the dividend payments.  On September 16, 1996 a dividend of $0.09 per share was paid.  The Company generated cash flow from operations of $361,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 and $6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1995.

<P>

In October of 1996 Kingsway successfully completed a secondary offering of its stock.  Intercargo participated in this offering, selling 250,000 shares (pre-split) and realizing a gain of $2.3 million which will be included in the fourth quarter.  The Kingsway stock now has a market value of approximately $44.4 million versus a current carried value of $12.5 million.  This represents a book value of an additional $4.15 per share not reflected in the company’s balance sheet.

<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) Includes retrospective reinsurance premium ceded of $1.4 million.  These premiums apply to coverages in prior periods.  Excluding this would result in E&O premium of $2,875,000 and a combined ratio for E&O of 103.9 for  the nine months ended September 30, 1996.  The total combined ratio giving effect to this would have been 100.3.

Third Quarter Report 1996

<P>
				
<B>INTERMET REPORTS PROFITS</B>

<P>

We are pleased to announce that Intermet Corporation today reported net income of $6.8 million on sales of $130 million for the third quarter of 1996.  Sales were up $13 million or 11% and net income was up $3.4 million or double the third quarter of 1995.  Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.27 compared to $0.14 for the same period last year.  Also today, Intermet's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, payable December 30, 1996 to shareholders of record December 1, 1996. 

<P>

We had record earnings for the first nine months.  Net income was $26.4 million on sales of $408 million.  Earnings were up 36% and sales were down 3% compared to the first nine months of 1995.  The reduction in sales was caused primarily from the divestiture of two businesses in late 1995 which contributed $30 million in sales during the same nine month period in 1995.  Record nine month earnings per share totaled $1.04, two cents higher than all of fiscal 1995.  At the end of the quarter, outstanding debt was $34 million, producing a debt-to-capital ratio of 22%.  However, cash equivalents of $34 million essentially offset debt.

<P>

Our aluminum castings plant continued to experience costs associated with a building expansion and the integration of new products during the third quarter.  These costs were partially offset by improved performance at some of our other U.S. foundries and our European operationsThe third quarter is traditionally our lowest revenue quarter due to customer summer vacations and model changeover.  We improved our margins compared to the similar period last year, however we are still not satisfied with them.  The above-mentioned costs at the aluminum plant, coupled with an imbalance of workload at our domestic foundries (i.e., some foundries have too much work and others have too little) is having a negative effect on our margins.

<P>

Overall, we are continuing our efforts to reduce costs across the Company and we are actively exploring acquisition opportunities.   The General Motors strike will have some effect on our fourth quarter results; the impact will of course be determined by the length of the strike.  GM related sales (Tier I and Tier II) represent about 19% of Intermet sales.  If all GM related sales stop, the cost to Intermet will probably be in the range of 3-4 cents earnings per share for each month of stoppage.

<P>

On behalf of all of the people of Intermet,
</blockquote><P>

Dear Stockholder:

<P>

The Company reported net income for the third quarter of 1996 of  approximately $27.5 million.  This was an increase of 23.8% over the net income for the third quarter of 1995 of  $22.2 million.  Earnings per share increased 21.4% to $.34 from $.28 for the comparable period of 1995.  Gross income for the third quarter of 1996 was $567.7 million, an increase of $75.2 million or 15.3% over 1995.  <I>The impact of foreign currency on the third quarter was negligible.   </I>

<P>

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $128.2 million, an increase of $27.1 million or  26.8% over 1995.  Earnings per share for the nine month period was $1.60 in 1996, an increase of 23.1% over 1995.  Included in the earnings per share figure is a gain of $.10 per share resulting from the sale of a portion of Interpublic's interests in the CKS Group, Inc.  Gross income for the nine month period ended September 30, 1996 was $1,749 million, a 15.8% increase over the gross income for the comparable period in 1995.  Gross income from United States operations increased 35.1%.  <I>Gross income from International operations increased 5.0%.   Gross income from international operations would have increased 8.4%, except for the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.
</I>
<P>

The Company's  agency systems gained record net new business during the first nine months of 1996 of approximately $888 million compared with the first nine months of 1995 of $694, an increase of 28%.  

<P>

Continuing cost containment efforts kept costs at appropriate levels.  The Company's financial condition continues to be excellent, with a strong balance sheet and a solid cash position.  

<P>

On October 21, 1996, the Board of Directors voted a dividend of 17 cents per share payable December 16, 1996 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 27, 1996.

<blockquote>To the shareholders of
<P>

Inter-Regional Financial Group:
<P>


 I am pleased to announce that net earnings for the third quarter of 1996 were $13.0 million, or $1.01 per share, on net revenues (revenues less interest expense) of $151.0 million.  In comparison,  third-quarter 1995 net earnings were $10.8 million, or 85 cents per share, on net revenues of $143.1 million.  Year-over-year net earnings were 20 percent higher for the quarter, while net revenues were 6 percent higher. 
<P>

Dain Bosworth contributed $99.7 million to net revenues and $15.2 million to pretax earnings in the quarter.  Rauscher Pierce Refsnes contributed $50.5 million to net revenues and $7.0 million to pretax earnings.
<P>

Year to date through September, IFG’s net earnings were $41.1 million,
or $3.19 per share, on net revenues of $460.9 million.  This compares very favorably with net earnings of $25.0 million, or $1.96 per share, on net revenues of $392.3 million in the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

IFG’s quarterly results remained very strong as we continued to experience generally positive market conditions.  Our Equity Capital Markets business enjoyed a particularly strong quarter, due in large part to increased underwriting, and merger and acquisition activity.  Private Client business continued to benefit from active markets and a more productive sales organization; however the pace of commission business has slowed somewhat from earlier quarters.  Our Fixed Income business remains challenged by difficult bond markets, but we have brought our cost structure in line with current conditions and remain committed to this as a core component of regional securities firms.
<P>

During the quarter IFG stock rose $6.375 per share, closing on September 30 at $32.375 per share, and we are 
pleased that IFG shares are now trading at multiples that are closer to industry averages.  IFG’s September 30 market price represented a ratio of 1.5 times book value per share, which is about the industry average, and 7.9 times earnings, which is still below the industry average for mid-sized securities firms of 8.8 times earnings.
<P>

IFG’s annualized return on average equity (ROE) thus far in 1996 is 22 percent, compared with 17 percent for the full year of 1995.  The company’s book value per share at the end of the third quarter increased to $21.40 from $20.51 at the end of the second quarter.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>

<B>Report to Shareholders reported on November 7, 1996</B>


<P>

 (Reno, Nev.) International Game Technology (NYSE "IGT") today announced fourth quarter and fiscal year operating results for the period ending September 30, 1996.  
<P>

    Net income for the twelve months was $118.0 million or $0.92 per fully diluted share compared to $92.6 million or $0.71 per fully diluted share reported last year. Total revenues during fiscal 1996 reached a record $733.5 million versus $620.8 million in the prior year.  
   
<P>
For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the Company reported net income of $36.3 million or $0.28 per share compared to $18.6 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.  Revenues during the current quarter totaled $220.0 million compared to $160.8 million reported in the prior year period.
   
<P>
 Fiscal year revenues were 18% higher than fiscal 1995, reflecting gains in both product sales and gaming 
 operations.  Product sales of $481.7 million for the current year represented a 16% improvement over last year.  Fourth quarter product sales were $148.0 million compared to $103.2 million in the comparable prior year period.  During the fourth quarter and fiscal 1996, IGT sold a total of 29,700 and 85,300 machines, respectively, versus 17,200 and 73,100 for the comparable prior periods.  Throughout the year, IGT’s largest markets were Nevada, Midwestern riverboats and Native American, where over 21,500, 15,000 and 13,000 machines were sold, respectively. Year over year growth in the Company’s product shipments resulted from the sale of 22,500 machines internationally.  These sales, which included 7,000 units in Japan, were up 100% over fiscal year 1995.
<P>

    Gross profit margin on product sales for fiscal 1996 was 45% versus 44% in fiscal 1995.  During the fourth quarter, however, product sales gross margin declined to 44% compared to 46% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.  Product sales margins for the current year and quarter were impacted by inventory reserves in Australia and lower margins in the Japanese market.  Domestic margins improved due to year over year operating efficiencies.
<P>

    Fiscal 1996 gaming operations revenue totaled $251.8 million versus $204.4 million for the prior year. Fourth quarter revenues from gaming operations totaled $72.0 million, up from $57.6 million during the same period in 1995.  Gaming operations revenues for the fiscal year and fourth quarter of 1996 showed the most improvement in the Native American and Louisiana markets.  During the current quarter two new systems were introduced, New Jersey Quarters Deluxe and Native American Fabulous 50’s.
  
<P>
  Depreciation expense on the Company’s gaming equipment related to progressive systems and leases has been reclassified from operating expenses to the cost of gaming operations for all periods presented.  This presentation more accurately reflects the results of gaming operations and has no impact on operating or net income of the Company.  The gross profit margin on gaming operations, with this reclassification, decreased to 45% from 46% for the fiscal year and rose from 43% to 47% for the fourth quarter due primarily to variations in interest rates.
<P>

    Operating income for fiscal 1996 was $169.8 million compared to $139.3 million in fiscal 1995.  For the fourth quarter, operating income was $58.8 million compared to $36.0 million last year.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year increased due to higher sales volume, charges relating to the abandonment of leased buildings and previously announced management changes.  Bad debt expense for the year was adversely affected by writedowns of receivables in emerging international markets.
<P>

    Other income for the year totaled $14.6 million, up from $5.4 million in fiscal 1995.  This increase is primarily the result of the one-time effects of the previously announced Australia and Casino Data Systems legal settlements during 1996 and the writedown of the Company’s investment of Radica in 1995.
<P>

    Pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program, the Company purchased 3,846,400 shares or approximately 3% of its outstanding common stock during fiscal 1996, primarily during the first two fiscal quarters.
<P>

    On October 14, 1996, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, payable on December 2, 1996, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 1996.
<P>

    IGT is a world leader in the design, development and manufacture of microprocessor-based gaming products and software systems, and is licensed in over 80 gaming jurisdictions throughout the world.  Its corporate headquarters are located in Reno, Nevada.

Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 1997 Results
</B>
<P>

Total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 increased 26.5% to $26.8 million, compared to $21.2 million in the second quarter last year.  Net income increased 29.7% to $2.9 million, or $0.32 per share, as compared to $2.2 million, or $0.24 per share, in the comparable quarter last year.
<P>
Total revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1997 were $51.9 million, an increase of 28.9% over the $40.2 million reported for the comparable six-month period of fiscal 1996.  Net income for the first six months of fiscal 1997 was up 41.0% to $5.7 million, or $0.64 per share, versus $4.0 million, or $0.43 per share in the prior year period.

<P>

John W. O’Leary, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter stating, "We are pleased to report yet another quarterly revenue record, marking our fifth consecutive quarterly revenue increase.  This quarter’s revenue of $26.8 million reflects a healthy $1.8 million increase from the previous record set only three months ago."

<P>

"We experienced strong growth in all three areas of our business:  OEM channel revenues were up 21.6% from the second quarter last fiscal year, aftermarket distributor and reseller sales increased 38.9% over the same period, and international aftermarket sales grew 202.8%.  The strength of our aftermarket business both here and overseas has resulted from our increased emphasis on these channels a year ago in anticipation of the evolution of our markets towards the aftermarket channel."

<P>

"The start-up of our new manufacturing facility continues on plan.  We were able to absorb the incremental depreciation and operating expenses from the new facility through increased sales volume and production efficiencies, and still set a quarterly operating income record of $4.6 million.  As the production volume in the new facility increases in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, our earnings per share growth is expected to resume."

<P>

"Our ambitious facility expansion program over the last two years is nearing completion and, consequently, the cash generated by our operating activities is now being used to reduce debt.  Our net debt position was reduced by $4.4 million during the quarter, and is expected to be converted to a net cash position over the next 12 months.  We continue to explore other opportunities to use this cash to further expand our business and increase stockholder value."

<BLOCKQUOTE>  <CENTER><B>International Lottery & Totalizator Systems Reports Loss for Third Quarter</B></CENTER>

<P>

<B>CARLSBAD, CA ...November 13, 1996... International Lottery & Totalizator Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITSI)</B> recorded a net loss for its third quarter ended September 30, 1996 of $3.6 million, or $0.20 per share, on $3.6 million in revenues, compared to a net loss of $6.5 million, or $0.39 per share, on $4.0 million in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 1995.

<P>

The 1996 period net loss was largely due to a $2.7 million charge to reflect a reserve provided by the company for its United Kingdom lottery system project.  The reserve was established after an affiliate of the customer was unable to obtain the additional financing necessary for the project start-up and on-going operations.  At this time, the customer has not indicated when a start-up may occur.  The amount of the charge approximates the company=s tangible investment, previously carried on the balance sheet as A Investment in Lottery Service Contracts," and has no cash flow impact.  The company is pursuing recovery of its investment through resumption of the United Kingdom project or the sale of the equipment.  However, no assurance can be provided that the company will be successful in these efforts.

<P>

At this time, the company expects a significant decrease in revenues for the fourth quarter of 1996, both as compared to the same period in 1995 and the third quarter of 1996, due to the current level of contract orders.  Total operating costs continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in 1996, as compared to 1995, as a result of on-going cost saving measures. 

<P>

With respect to the September 30, 1996 consolidated balance sheet, the company has $10 million in working capital, a steady cash position, reduced inventories and no borrowings.

<P>

As of today, backlog is approximately $1.3 million, which includes $.8 million related to the company’s project with The Revenue Markets, Inc. ("ATRMI" for the New York Thruway.  

<P>

Terminals delivered by the company under its project with TRMI have not yet been accepted.  The company has contract receivables and project related inventory of $2.3 million.  The company expects to be paid under the contract by fulfilling its obligations.

<P>

Other new business includes a $.5 million order for DATAMARK Flipper terminals for the Philippine lottery.  These terminals will be manufactured and delivered during the fourth quarter of 1996.  Vigorous sales efforts continue in pursuit of new business from both new and existing customers. Significant opportunities exist for both lottery and pari-mutuel contracts in a number of markets, including North America, Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe.

<P>

Separately, on November 1, the San Diego County Superior Court entered a summary judgment in favor of the company in a legal action against the company and ILTS president Frederick A. Brunn by James T. Walters, the company=s former chairman and president.  Mr. Walters has filed a notice of appeal with the California appellate court.

<BLOCKQUOTE>  December 15,  1996

<P>

Dear Shareholder:

<P>

Periodically, we are fortunate to find ourselves in the position of being in the right place at the right time.  As a shareholder of International Panorama, you have effectively positioned yourself to participate in, and profit from, the renaissance of a once prolific mining region in a country that is preparing for its future through enlightened political and economic policies, after decades of mismanagement and neglect.

<P>

As one of the first international mining companies to have entered into an agreement with Gecamines, the state mining enterprise of Zaire, AND having received all Zairian government approvals, we are in the vanguard of the renaissance of this strategic nation in the heart of Africa.  Based upon our initial project assessments, which are subject to final verification in the feasibility report being prepared, we are poised to become one of the world’s largest producers in cobalt within two years!

<P>

Some shareholders expressed concern during the past month over the newsmedia reports about the refugee problems on the Zaire-Rwanda border.  While troubled by the plight of the refugees, I am pleased to report that our operations at Kambove and Kakanda, over 1,000 km south of the troubled region, have been completely unaffected and are likely to remain so.  With the magnitude of the refugee situation in eastern Zaire already diminished, the government is now advancing toward democracy, with reports of elections scheduled for May 1997.  Once these elections are held, a further strengthening of the investment potential of Zaire will occur.  That, of course, will trigger a great influx of mining companies into Zaire.  With our present Kambove/Kakanda project and our expectation of additional projects in the near future, we will already have firmly established ourselves in the forefront of Zairian mining.

<P>

Scott Fraser, editor of the Natural Contrarian, recently wrote a Special Update and Alert to his subscribers about International Panorama.  I have arranged for his office to provide a complimentary copy to our shareholders.  To request this informative report call 800-596-1302.

<P>

I am confident that 1997 will be the most significant year of International Panorama’s history.  By this time next year, we anticipate being well advanced with construction of our processing plant.  Have a joyful Holiday Season and healthy and prosperous New Year.

<P>

Yours very truly,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

	Consolidated sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 1996 increased 10.5 percent to $12,688,114 from sales of $11,479,351 for the same period last year.  Skyland’s sales for the three-month period ended June 30, 1996 increased 47% to $1,125,987 compared with sales of  $765,745 for the same period last year.  
<P>

	Operating income decreased to $2,851,925 from $3,147,270 for the same period last year.  This decrease in operating income was primarily due to a one time charge of $350,000 on a pre-tax basis ($210,000 after tax) in connection with the establishment of two new validation service offices and relocation of the headquarters of the Company’s Skyland subsidiary.  Operating  income was also impacted by increased competitive factors including pricing pressures which, as previously reported, are expected to continue during 1996 and by increased payroll and payroll - related costs resulting from the
additions to the Corporate management staff.
<P>

	Consolidated net income for the second quarter decreased to $1,774,715 from $1,987,761 a year ago.  This decrease in net income was attributable to the reasons described above.  Based on a weighted average of 7,172,600 common shares outstanding in the second quarter compared with a weighted average of 7,189,192 common shares outstanding a year ago, earnings per share were 25 cents for 1996 compared to 28 cents a year ago.
<P>

	Consolidated sales for the six-month period ended June 30, 1996 increased 5.8 percent to $24,257,648 from sales of $22,934,377 for the same period in 1995.  Skyland’s sales for the six-month period  ended June 30, 1996 increased  5.4 % to $1,902,789 compared with sales of $1,805,678 for the same period last year.  
<P>

	Operating income decreased to $5,253,329 from $6,221,650 for the same period last year.<BR>
	Consolidated net income for the six months ended June 30, 1996 decreased to $3,259,216 from $3,851,963 a year ago.  This decrease in net income was attributable to the reasons described above.  Based on a weighted average of 7,182,112 common shares outstanding in the second quarter, earnings per share were 45 cents for 1996 compared to 53 cents a year ago.
<P>

<B>Balance Sheet Highlights</B><BR>
	The Company saw a further strengthening of its already very strong balance sheet.  This is a result of continued strong earnings and cash flows.
	The Company’s current assets to current liabilities ratio is 10.3:1 and the debt to equity ratio is .09:1.
	Stockholders’ equity continued to increase, reaching $93,506,445 at June 30, 1996, compared to $92,172,892 at December 31, 1995, resulting in an increase in book value per share to $13.64 from $13.20, an increase of 3.4%.
<P>

<B>Business</B><BR>
		Revenues for the second quarter were up 11% versus a year ago.  This increase in revenues was a result of a combination of stronger demand from some of our existing customers, addition of new customers and improvement in our validation business.  Operating income prior to the one time charge was at about last year’s level.  The lag of income growth behind sales growth is due to continued pricing pressures, as well as the increased cost of a strengthened management staff.
<P>

		The Company is continuing with the quality improvement and efficiency boosting projects it has started, such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Company-wide computer networking to increase the efficiency of data transmittal and inter-facility communications
<LI>computerized process and inventory control system which will help improve customer service and labor utilization
<LI>expanding ability to process larger EtO volumes 
<LI>adding to cobalt inventory to meet improving demand
<LI>the commissioning of a new ethylene oxide test vessel in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to serve the validation and research needs of our customers nationwide.
</UL>
<P>

	In addition, the Company continued to actively look to identify new business building, as well as cost saving, opportunities.
<P>

	While there are no guarantees for future performance, the current outlook is for continued revenue growth as a result of the progress made in gaining new business both in the medical device base business area, as well as in areas with good growth potential, such as spices, cosmetics and consumer products.
<P>

	In addition, the Company continues its pioneering on the longer-term project of food irradiation, which the Company believes will result in significant benefits to consumers and will present opportunities for growth in business.
<P>

	We would like to take this opportunity to thank our loyal customers, employees and shareholders for their continuing support.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CENTER><B>1996 SECOND QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER><P>
<B>To Our Fellow Shareholders and Employees:</B>
<P>
As you may know, late in June we issued a news release forecasting that, due to a variety of factors, our second quarter results would be significantly below those of prior quarters.  On August 2, 1996, we issued our actual results, which included a net loss for the 1996 second quarter of $16.0 million, or $.13 per common share.  These results are summarized in the tables below.
<P>
The difficulties of the second quarter, although significant, were limited to our U.S. generic drug business, where high customer inventories at a time of declining prices resulted in exceptionally high levels of customer inventory credits, reserves and other allowances.  Together, these credits, reserves and allowances were $44 million higher than our average levels in recent quarters, and were the primary cause of this quarter’s disappointing results.  In addition, price declines reduced our profit margins, and significant customer inventories reduced reorders.
<P>
Due to our second quarter results, we failed to comply as of the end of the second quarter with one of the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility. We received a waiver from the banks regarding this event of noncompliance, and we intend to request a permanent amendment to the facility which would modify the covenant going forward.
<P>
We believe that the challenges unique to this period are behind us.  The broader challenges of the generic drug industry as a whole, and its tremendous opportunities, remain.  We will meet these challenges with strategies improved as a result of this most difficult quarter. We plan to strengthen our management team, reduce operating expenses and moderate those selling initiatives which can create high levels of inventory. We also intend to develop a base of long-term customer contracts and arrangements.  More significantly, we will continue to exploit the industry’s opportunities with a science team that has led all companies in U.S. generic drug approvals, and with a distribution network that is among the most extensive in the industry. 
<P>
The industry opportunities should be considerable — over the last three years, the U.S. market for generic drugs doubled to more than $6 billion, and industry experts generally expect it to double yet again over the next three to five years.  Only a limited number 
of companies will meaningfully participate in this rapidly growing market and, among them, IVAX is certainly very well positioned.
<P>
Further, we are actively engaged in an ambitious program to develop and bring to market a number of proprietary pharmaceutical products, including Elmiron® for interstitial cystitis, Cervene® for ischemic stroke, and PaxeneTM for certain cancers. FDA approval and introduction of Elmiron®, expected this year, will be a landmark event in our evolution into a proprietary drug pioneer.  At our Norton Healthcare subsidiary, which is the largest generic drug company in the U.K., the proprietary drug side of that business already accounts for a growing part of our sales and profits.
<P>
We want to assure you that management and the Board of Directors remain focused on building long-term shareholder value. These most recent challenges do not diminish the exciting future that we envision for our company, and we look forward to your continued participation as we work to make that vision a reality.

<CENTER><B>First Quarter Fiscal Year 1997 Results</B></CENTER>
<P>



<B>Dear Shareholders:</B>
<P>


	With the Company's turnaround now complete, management is dedicating energy and resources toward successfully implementing the next important step in a strategic plan to position your company for sustained growth and increased shareholder value.  Inherent in our turnaround is our focused commitment to building and expanding our core business:  hardware sales and service, which represents approximately 53 percent of current 
<P>

 revenues.  Revenues are augmented by contributions from Touring operations, film licensing, and joint ventures.  While Touring suffered a temporary setback in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 due to the expiration of a sponsorship agreement, we are actively seeking replacement sponsors while evaluating new avenues for generating revenue growth from this segment.  
<P>

	Going forward into fiscal 1997, it is our goal to focus on further enlarging the base from which we generate recurring revenue.  In addition to seeking growth from our historical, core areas, we seek additional joint venture relationships and owned-and-operated sites that will allow your company to directly participate in gate receipts. An increasing recurring revenue base provides the Company with the opportunity to generate a more stable, predictable revenue flow.  
<P>

	As we pursue this goal, a few things will change:  First, we will have the opportunity to use Iwerks' hardware equipment to represent Iwerks' contribution to a joint venture, which will result in some hardware sales being treated as an investment under those joint venture agreements.  Second, we will continue to grow the recurring revenue stream from our motion simulator film library, which is the largest in the industry.
<P>


<B>Joint Venture Partnerships Established</B><BR>
During our 1997 fiscal first quarter, we made progress toward reaching our joint venture goals.  Moderate contributions were made to first quarter revenues by the recent opening of TurboRide simulation theaters at Hoyts Cinema in Melbourne, Australia, which opened in July and drew enthusiastic audiences.  Another joint venture, Dave &  Buster's restaurant/entertainment complex, opened in late September in Philadelphia.  We anticipate installing additional TurboRide theaters for Hoyts Cinema and for Dave & Buster's this fiscal year.  A third joint venture, the CyberDOME in New York City, is scheduled to open in the third quarter of our fiscal year.  While neither Hoyts nor Dave & Buster's joint venture made significant contributions to revenue because of the timing of their openings, we expect these joint ventures, together with CyberDOME, to positively impact future revenues and earnings.  
<P>


<B>Financial Results</B><BR>
For the quarter, revenues were $9.6 million compared with $10.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  The Company reported net income of $174,000, or $.01 per share, compared with net income of $141,000, or $.01 per share, for the comparable period a year ago.
	
<P>
The first quarter revenues include a 16-percent increase in hardware and systems sales, which was more than offset by a decline in revenues from Touring operations.  The decrease in touring revenues over the same quarter last year resulted from the decreased number of sponsorship days from a major sponsor, along with a lower average daily rate.  The contract with this major sponsor also expired during the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and the Company is actively seeking additional sponsors and evaluating other alternatives regarding this segment of our business.  However, the time lapse in renewing sponsorship contracts, plus seasonal weather, are expected to have a correlating negative impact on second and third-quarter Touring revenues resulting in a decline in margin contribution from that segment.  
	
<P>
Also impacting revenues were unanticipated delays in receiving deposits on signed contracts for projects in mainland China, where the existing system of government, by its nature, impedes the permit approval process.  We are seeing progress in these contracts and expect most of the open issues to be resolved in the near future.
<P>


<B>Strengthened Management Team	</B><BR>
Late in the quarter, we strengthened our management team with the addition of Bruce C. Hinckley as our new chief financial officer.  Formerly chief accounting officer at Caesars World Inc., a $1.4 billion gaming and hospitality company and approximately 10,000 employees, Mr. Hinckley has diversified international and domestic financial management and accounting experience.  With his strategic insight and team-oriented approach, he is a great addition to our team as we seek to raise the Iwerks' brand to new levels. 

<P>

<B>Outlook</B><BR>
We ended the quarter with more than $23 million in cash and short-term investments and less than $2.5 million in long-term debt.  Our balance sheet solidly positions us for growth as we continue to invest in expanding our presence in the marketplace.  We look forward to opening additional joint venture sites throughout the fiscal year as well as establishing new joint venture relationships, both of which will contribute to a growing base of recurring revenue.  Additionally, management continues to diligently control costs while exploring new avenues for enhancing growth and earnings.  
<P>

	We thank you — our shareholders, colleagues, and suppliers — for your loyalty and support, and we will keep your apprised of future developments through upcoming communications.

<P>

Sincerely,<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>Jenny Craig Reports First Quarter Results</B></CENTER>

<P>

	LA JOLLA, CALIF., OCTOBER 28, 1996 -- Jenny Craig, Inc. (NYSE:JC) today reported revenues of $90.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 compared to $99.6 million for the same quarter a year ago.  Average revenue per Company-owned centre totaled $134,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 versus $149,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.
	
<P>
Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 was $2.1 million, or $.10 per share, versus $4.1 million, or $.16 per share for the same quarter a year ago.  Operating income was $3.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 versus $6.3 million for the same quarter a year ago.
	
<P>
"After achieving six consecutive quarterly increases in revenues versus comparable quarters in prior fiscal years, we remain optimistic about the Company’s prospects for the future despite our performance for the recent quarter," said C. Joseph LaBonté, president and chief executive officer.  "As we said in August 1996, we believe revenues were impacted by heightened publicity related to new weight-loss medications, which have given many people false hope that a ‘magic pill’ is all that is needed to lose weight.  However, medical experts, including former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, report that weight-loss medications are most effective when patients follow a moderate, reduced-calorie diet, exercise regularly and change the behaviors that contributed to their weight gain — this is the fundamental philosophy of the Jenny Craig program.  Independent research recently revealed that 96% of board-certified physicians recommend that weight-loss medications be combined with such a weight management program.  Our challenge is to improve communications with the medical community and the public to increase awareness that the Jenny Craig program is the perfect partner for medically-assisted weight management."
	
<P>
During the first quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company began test marketing a new program incorporating weight-loss medications along with the traditional elements of its weight management program.  In doing so, Jenny Craig’s management has assembled a nationwide network of doctors who have been independently contracted to offer weight-loss medications as an adjunct to the Company’s core business.  Currently, this new program is being offered in centres in eight test markets across the United States, and early results indicate increased interest in the program.
	
<P>
Since mid-September, leads have been increasing in the Company’s core business above levels previously reported for July and August, although leads remain approximately 20 percent below year ago levels for this period of time.  Deposits and active program participants, which traditionally lag behind leads, should also show improvement.  Added Mr. LaBonté,  "We realize that results for one month do not constitute a trend — however, it appears that the decline in leads and sales have bottomed out and have moved upward in October.  We will continue to refine this new program and expand it into other U.S. markets during the current quarter."
	
<P>
Jenny Craig, Inc. continued to maintain a strong balance sheet during the quarter, with cash and short-term investments totaling $42.9 million compared to $65.8 million at September 30, 1995.  This change is attributed to the Company’s repurchase of nearly 4.4 million shares of outstanding common stock during fiscal 1996 at an aggregate cost of approximately $44.4 million.  In addition, in July 1996, the Company completed the purchase of a 75,000-square-foot office building in which it has consolidated its executive offices.  The total purchase price was $8.36 million.  In October 1996, the Company received $6 million in financing related to the purchase of the building.
	
<P>
Founded in 1983, Jenny Craig, Inc. is one of the largest weight management service companies in the world.  The Company provides consumers with a comprehensive weight management program focusing on nutrition, exercise, personal support and lifestyle changes, as well as an ongoing weight maintenance program.  Centres are located in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico. At September 30, 1996, the Company owned 628 centres with an additional 163 centres owned by franchisees, bringing to 791 the total number of centres in operation, compared to 780 centres in operation at September 30, 1995.

<P>

This quarterly report may include forward-looking statements about the Company’s revenues, earnings, margins and other future plans and objectives.  Any such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to vary materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are: increased competition; technological and scientific developments, including appetite suppressants and other drugs which can be used in weight-loss programs; increases in cost of food or services; lack of market acceptance of additional products and services; legislative and regulatory restrictions; effectiveness of marketing and advertising programs; prevailing domestic and foreign economic conditions; and the risk factors set forth from time to time in the Company’s annual reports and other reports and filings with the SEC.

<a name="letter"><CENTER><h3>Third Quarter Report 1996</h3></CENTER></a>


<P>
<B>To Our Shareholders:</B>
<P>
Kaman Corp. third quarter 1996 net earnings rose nearly 28% to $5.8 million from $4.6 million a year ago. Earnings available to common shareholders during the third quarter were $4.9 million, or 26 cents per common share primary, 25 cents per common share fully diluted, compared to $3.6 million, or 20 cents per common share primary and fully diluted, in the same period last year. 
<P>
Revenues for the third quarter were $228.0 million, up slightly from $226.0 million in 1995.
<P>
For the first nine months of 1996, net earnings rose more than 11% to $16.4 million from $14.8 million a year ago. Earnings available to common shareholders during the first nine months of 1996 were $13.7 million, or 73 cents per common share primary, 70 cents per common share fully diluted, compared to $12.0 million, or 65 cents per common share primary, 64 cents per common share fully diluted, in 1995. Earnings for the first nine months of last year include a pre-tax gain of approximately$1.8 million, or 6 cents per common share, on the sale of real estate within the Diversified Technologies segment during the first quarter. Adjusted to exclude the one-time gain in 1995, net earnings for the first nine months of 1996 were up 20% over last year.
<P>
Revenues for the first nine months of this year were up nearly 9% to $714.6 million from $657.9 million in 1995.
<P>
Our Diversified Technologies segment continued to grow during the third quarter, with increased operating profits and a major contract award from the Air Force. The commercial aerospace market continues to show renewed strength. We are experiencing increased orders for the structures and products we make for Boeing and the other manufacturers of a wide range of airliners and business aircraft.
<P>
Kaman Sciences won a major contract from the Air Force during the quarter for software support services to Cheyenne Mountain Air Station, Colorado. This is the third consecutive award we won including the original contract in 1987, and it has grown substantially. The estimated value of the contract, plus options for the next five years is $150 million, though this is expected to grow as Air Force requirements increase. The contract limits the maximum value to $400 million.
<P>
The K-MAX® Vertical Replenishment (VERTREP) demonstration with the U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command (MSC) is now past the midway point. The two K-MAX helicopters have been providing 100% availability rates in the Arabian Gulf deployment.
<P>
While decisions on the competitions in Australia and New Zealand for the potential sale of SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopters have been anticipated, they have been delayed due to the election in New Zealand and other factors. The earliest we expect an announcement is year-end.
<P>
Though the economy slowed slightly during the third quarter, Kaman Industrial Technologies grew in both sales and operating profit. The company continues to open up new branches in the south and midwest to service new accounts and target additional business in these rapidly growing industrial regions.
<P>
Kaman Music operating profits improved during the third quarter, despite flat sales. The U.S. music market was strong, while international markets lagged behind. We are watching all markets closely as we approach the holiday selling season. We also continue to focus on improving our European amplifier manufacturing operations.
<P>
Thank you for your continued interest in Kaman.
<P>
Sincerely,

To Our Unitholders:
<P>

	We are pleased to report that Kaneb Pipe Line Partners, L.P. had a record second quarter and six months results for the period ended June 30, 1996.  Revenues were $28,795,000 for the three months and $56,621,000 for the six months ended June 30, 1996 compared to $23,342,000 and $43,724,000 for the comparable periods last year.  Net income for the three months ended June 30, 1996 was $10,007,000, up from $8,458,000 for the prior year period, and for the six months net income was $18,684,000 compared to $15,757,000 for the same period last year.
<P>

	We had a very good first half of the year as pipeline barrel miles shipped increased 5% despite unusually high amounts of rainfall in the Midwest that adversely affected product demand on our East Pipeline system in the second quarter.  Results from our terminaling operations improved significantly, primarily due to the inclusion of the terminals acquired from Steuart Petroleum Company in December of last year.
<P>

	Operating income from pipeline operations was $8,022,000 for the three months ended June 30, 1996, up $883,000 over the 1995 second quarter, and was $14,594,000 for the six months, a $2,052,000 improvement over the same period last year.  Operating income from terminaling operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 1996, including the former Steuart terminals, was $4,819,000 and $9,847,000, respectively, compared to $2,958,000 and $6,181,000 for the comparable prior year periods.

<CENTER><b>Keithley Instruments Announces Record<BR>Sales for Fiscal 1996 Third Quarter</b></CENTER>
<p>

<blockquote>




<P>

Cleveland, Ohio  - July 22, 1996  -  Keithley Instruments, Inc. (NYSE:KEI) reported net sales of $29.4 million for the third quarter ended June 30, 1996, up slightly from $29.0 million in the prior year.  Net income of $761,000 was down 49 percent from $1,494,000 last year.  Net income per share was $.10 compared with $.20 last year.  Per-share figures are adjusted for a 100 percent stock dividend paid in December 1995.
<P>

"We are disappointed with our financial results this quarter," stated Joseph P. Keithley, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "For the first time in many years, the semiconductor capital equipment industry is in a downturn.  We are pleased, however, to report the first revenue from our Quantox™ Oxide Monitoring System designed for semiconductor wafer manufacturers," added Mr. Keithley.
<P>

"The semiconductor downturn, as well as the delay in shipping additional units of Quantox, hurt our financial performance for the quarter," stated Mr. Keithley.  "While industry conditions over the short term are weak, we believe the long-term outlook for the semiconductor industry remains strong.  We continue to feel confident that the investments we are making now in new products and new businesses will contribute increasingly to sales growth.  We remain committed to seeing these investments to fruition," added


Mr. Keithley.  For the quarter, the company invested $3.0 million in new business activities.


<P>
Orders for the third quarter of $27.5 million decreased 6 percent from the prior year's quarter.  "Orders within the United States for our automatic parametric test systems serving the semiconductor industry and Keithley MetraByte Division's PC-based board level products have fallen off,"  stated Mr. Keithley.  "We now believe that earnings for the fourth quarter will be below those of last year's quarter, and it may be difficult to achieve the results that we posted for the third quarter given the uncertainty of the semiconductor industry," added Mr. Keithley.  The company's backlog decreased $2.0 million during the quarter and stood at $10.6 million at June 30, 1996.  Total debt increased $1.6 million during the quarter to $11.4 million at June 30, 1996.


<P>
For the nine months that ended June 30, 1996, net sales were $89.2 million, up 11 percent from $80.4 million in the same period last year.  Net income was up 7 percent to $3,391,000, or $.43 per share, compared with $3,158,000, or $.42 per share on a fully diluted basis, in last year’s nine months.  Per-share figures are adjusted for the 100 percent stock dividend paid in December 1995.


<P>
Keithley Instruments, Inc. provides measurement-based solutions to semiconductor manufacturers and growth segments of the electronics and medical industries.  Engineers and scientists around the world use Keithley's advanced hardware and software for process monitoring, production test and basic research.

<B>To Our Shareholders:</B><BR>
You should be pleased to know that although our funds from operations for the third quarter of 1996 were slightly below the levels of the same period last year, we made great progress as a company towards our goal of increasing shareholder value.
<P>
Perhaps the biggest news of the quarter was the announcement of the agreement to acquire Union Property Investors (UPI). This is a great step for Kranzco. UPI owns 16 real estate properties in 11 states, including nine shopping centers and seven single tenant commercial properties. These stores are strategically located in markets with excellent demographics. They will broaden our geographic coverage, and enlarge our major tenant base. After the merger, Kranzco will own 54 properties in 16 states with a total of seven million gross leasable square feet, a 22 percent increase. The agreement will also reduce our sensitivity to economic cycles by spreading our asset base over 16 states rather than seven.
<P>
We are also pleased to report the signing of a major lease with Ames Department Stores. The lease is for a 60,140 
square-foot Ames discount store at the Valley Forge Mall in Phoenixville, PA. The store is scheduled to open in April, 1997 and replaces the Jamesway store which closed at the end of 1995.
<P>
During the quarter, the company also signed four additional leases totaling more than 110,000 square feet, including leases for a Circuit City store and a T.J. Maxx. Third quarter funds from operations totaled $4,516,000 or 44 cents per share compared with $4,832,000 or 47 cents per share for the same period last year. Net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $1,877,000 or 18 cents per share, compared with $2,275,000 or 22 cents per share for the 1995 quarter.
<P>
For the first nine months of 1996, funds from operations were $13,586,000 or $1.32 per share compared with $14,287,000 or $1.38 per share for the same period of the prior year. The company reported a net loss of $5,339,000 or 52 cents per share for the first nine months of 1996 which included a second quarter $11,052,000 extraordinary loss on debt refinancing. Excluding the extraordinary loss, net income was $5,713,000 or 55 cents per share. This compared with net income of $7,005,000 or 68 cents per share for the same period last year. Revenues increased to $41,454,000 versus $39,139,000, an increase of 6 percent, primarily reflecting the full nine-month effects of the acquisition of five centers completed in April 1995.
<P>
In early December, the Board of Trustees, anticipating the opportunities ahead, declared the regular quarterly cash dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on January 20, 1997 to shareholders of record on December 24, 1996.
<P>
We certainly share the Board’s optimism about the future direction of Kranzco Realty Trust. Our years of experience in the retail industry continues to attract top quality tenants and broaden our geographic presence. Prudent financial and operating management will continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Thank you for your support and I look forward to reporting on the results of our efforts.
Sincerely,
     </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><b>First Quarter Report 1996</b>
<p>
<B>To Our Shareholders:</B>

<P>

	We are pleased to report our results for the first quarter of 1996.  Net income for the three months ended March 31, 1996, rose 42% to $1,777,000, or $.25 per share, from $1,251,000, or $.20 per share, for the same period in 1995. Revenues advanced 56% to a record $26,637,000 from $17,115,000 for the first quarter in 1996. Net income rose faster than earnings per share due to a 936,000 increase in the average number of common shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s public offering of common stock in February 1996. 

<P>

	For the first time in the Company’s history, quarterly revenues exceeded $25 million. This increase in revenue was primarily driven by the growth in operating lease revenue from our client/server network leasing business with large corporate customers.

<P>

<B>Financing Activities</B>

<P>

	The first quarter marked the occurrence of two important events that will enhance our ability to finance higher levels of equipment acquisitions.  In February, we completed a $31.5 million public stock offering, the proceeds of which will be used primarily for investment in new lease transactions.  The successful completion of this offering allowed the Company to surpass $50 million in shareholders’ equity and $100 million in market capitalization and to attract several new large institutional investors.

<P>

	Our financing capability was further enhanced in March, when we closed a $100 million non-recourse revolving line of credit at advantageous rates with Citicorp Securities, under which we refinanced nearly $40 million of lease receivables.   This line of credit also provides another source of interim financing for our lease transactions prior to long-term financing through a securitization.  These events demonstrated our increasing access to the capital markets at quite favorable pricing, which has allowed us to reduce the average interest rate on our debt.

<P>

<B>European Expansion</B>

<P>

	In April 1996, we acquired a UK leasing operation, which included a computer brokerage operation and small computer refurbishment activity.  These operations were consolidated under the newly formed Leasing Solutions (UK) Ltd.  The combined European operations have assets of US$3.8 million and generated gross revenues of US$5.5 million.  The purpose of this acquisition was to gain a toe-hold into the European computer leasing market and to support the leasing requirements of our multi-national customers obtained through our vendor programs.  It is not anticipated that the acquisition will have an impact on the analyst’s consensus estimate of earnings per share in 1996.  However, it is anticipated that the UK operation will provide a positive effect on our 1997 performance.

<P>

	Our European expansion was further enhanced in May, by our signing an agreement with Dell Computer’s European operation to provide a vendor leasing program for Dell’s major European corporate customers.   Under this agreement, Leasing Solutions (UK) Ltd. will provide a full-service leasing program for Dell’s full line of products.  This agreement expands our relationship with Dell and supports our strategy of offering expanded geographic coverage to existing vendor partners. 

<P>

<B>A Look Ahead</B>

<P>

	The future holds tremendous opportunities for Leasing Solutions.  Our European acquisition and the Dell European vendor program confirm our efforts to expand internationally, which allows us to take advantage of the growing international needs of our multi-national vendor partners.  We plan to offer our services to vendors and customers in additional European countries, commencing with Germany, as soon as possible.  Our objective is to continue to position the Company for sustained growth and to deliver positive long-term results for our shareholders.  Thank you for your continued support of Leasing Solutions.  We look forward to reporting continued success to you in quarters to come.   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote>
On October 16, the Board of Directors of the General Partner increased the quarterly cash distribution to $0.68 per unit from $0.64.  The distribution is payable November 14, 1996 to unitholders of record October 31, 1996.  The increase in distribution, the second since the partnership's inception, raises the annual distribution rate to $2.72 per unit and is the result of continued earnings growth and removal of the uncertainty relating to the partnerships' tolls. 

<P>

Mr. Patrick Daniel, President of Lakehead Pipe Line Company, Inc., the General Partner, said that in recent years the Partnership has been following a very conservative distribution policy compared to most other master limited partnerships, pending settlement of its rate refund obligations.  Mr. Daniel said "As a result of the resolution of the Partnership's refund obligations and future rates, the Partnership is now in a position to move gradually toward a more typical master limited partnership distribution pay-out.  Following today's increase, the pay-out ratio will still be more conservative than average, in anticipation of significant investment during 1997 and 1998 for expansion of the pipeline.  However, increased cash flow from this investment will enhance the Partnership's future distribution capability."

<P>

Third quarter net income was $17.7 million, or $0.72 per unit compared with 1995 third quarter net income of $14.5 million, or $0.59 per unit.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996 net income was $28.6 million, or $1.15 per unit, compared with $24.7 million, or $0.99 per unit for the same period last year.

<P>

On October 16, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formally approved the tariff rate agreement, reached earlier with customer representatives, which provides for a reduction in current tariff rates of approximately 6% and total rate refunds and interest of $120.0 million.  Of the amount to be refunded, approximately $37.0 million will be paid in a lump sum in the fourth quarter of 1996, with the remainder repaid through reduced tolls over the next three years.  Of the rate refunds and interest accrued in 1996 ($41.5 million) $25.3 million is related to prior years.  If the prior years' effects of the accruals were removed from both nine month periods, recalculated net income and net income per unit would be $53.7 million, or $2.18 per unit for 1996 versus $48.8 million, or $1.99 per unit for 1995.

<P>

Deliveries for the quarter increased to 1,416,000 barrels per day, 2% higher than the same period in 1995.  Deliveries for the first nine months of 1996 averaged a record 1,421,000 barrels per day versus 1,405,000 barrels for the first nine months of 1995, an increase of 16,000 barrels. 

<P>

Operating revenue for the third quarter of 1996 was up $1.7 million, or 3%, from 1995's third quarter.  Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 1996 were $1.4 million less than the corresponding period in 1995.  This decrease is due to lower power costs achieved through the Partnership's ongoing power cost management initiatives.  Operating revenue for the nine months ended September 30 was up slightly over 1995.  Excluding provisions for prior years' rate refunds, operating expenses for the nine month period were $3.3 million less than the same period of 1995, again primarily due to lower power costs. 

<P>

Right-of-way acquisition and environmental permitting work has begun for a new 450 mile 24 inch pipeline from Superior, Wisconsin to the Chicago, Illinois area.  This expansion will increase delivery capacity by approximately 170,000 barrels per day to important U.S. Midwest markets at an approximate cost of $300 million.  Completion of the expansion is planned for the second half of 1998.  It is anticipated that this expansion, which complements an expansion in Canada on the Interprovincial Pipe Line System, will be financed with internally-generated cash, borrowings and the proceeds from additional equity issuances.

<P>

Capital expenditures to September 30, 1996 totaled $52.5 million, and are expected to total approximately $85 million for the entire year.  The majority of this year's capital expenditures are for the Partnership's 1996 system expansion.  This expansion will increase delivery capacity into Chicago area markets by up to 120,000 barrels per day at a cost of approximately $65 million.  Approximately 40,000 barrels per day of this added capacity will be required to offset the effects of moving increased volumes of heavy crude oil, which can lower system delivery capability.  1996 capital expenditures are being financed with internally-generated cash and borrowings under the Partnership's credit facility.

<LI>On October 16, 1996, the FERC approved a July 1996 agreement between the Partnership and customer representatives on all outstanding contested tariff rates.  The agreement results in total rate refunds and related interest of  $120.0 million through an effective date of October 1, 1996.  Of that total, approximately $37 million will be refunded in a lump sum in the fourth quarter of 1996, with the remainder (including additional carrying charges) repaid through reduced tolls over a three year period. The Partnership has accrued rate refunds and related interest of $120.0 million through September 30, 1996 of which $41.5 million has been accrued this year to reflect the agreement . Of the amount accrued in 1996, rate refunds related to 1996 ($10.8 million) have reduced Operating Revenue, with the prior years' portion ($22.1 million) separately stated as a Provision for Prior Years' Rate Refunds.  Accrued interest ($8.6 million, of which $3.2 million is related to prior years) has been reflected in Interest Expense.
<P>

<B>Oct. 15, 1996

<P>

Dear Lam Shareholder,</B>

<P>

<B>Today we announced</B> total revenues of  $282.8 million for the company’s first quarter of fiscal 1997, ended September 30, 1996.  Revenues for the first quarter of  fiscal 1996 were $263.2 million.

<P>

<B>Net income was $10.6 million</B> ($0.35 per share, fully diluted), which included a restructuring charge of  $9.0 million ($0.21 per share, fully diluted) recorded during the quarter, compared to $30.5 million ($1.00 per share, fully diluted) in the prior year period.

<P>

<B>The company attributed  its lower earnings</B> to several factors, including lower system sales compared to the immediately preceding quarter, and a mix of  lower gross profit margin tools purchased by customers, primarily the company’s new Advanced Capability Alliance™ multichamber cluster tool.  Gross profit margins were also adversely impacted by lower than anticipated manufacturing capacity utilization.

<P>

<B>Lam’s book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter</B> remained under 1:1.  In August, SEMI, the industry trade organization for worldwide wafer fab equipment manufacturers, which includes Lam, reported a book-to-bill ratio for front-end wafer fab equipment of  0.72.  The company anticipates that the slowdown in the demand for the company’s products may persist for several quarters, resulting in a further reduction in bookings, revenues, and net profits during this indeterminate period.

<P>

<B>In response to these market conditions,</B> Lam is aggressively implementing its plan for maximizing profitability both now and in the future. Our restructuring in August, which resulted in an 11 percent work force reduction,  has contributed  to a significant reduction in operating expenses, down 22 percent, excluding the $9.0 million restructuring charge taken in the quarter, from fourth quarter fiscal 1996 levels.   Inventory levels of  $283 million in the first quarter have been reduced by 12 percent from the prior quarter.  Lam is well positioned with a portfolio of next-generation etch and deposition tools for meeting customer requirements into the 0.25 micron, deep submicron era and beyond.

<P>

Sincerely,

<CENTER><B>LANDS’ END REPORTS THIRD QUARTER</B></CENTER>
<P>
DODGEVILLE, WIS. ... November 14, 1996 ... Lands’ End, Inc. (LE), today reported that net sales for its third quarter ended November 1, 1996, totaled $287.4 million, up 21.8 percent from sales of $235.9 million in the same quarter last year when sales declined 4.2 percent.  On an adjusted calendar-year basis (prior year was a 53-week year), net sales for the quarter just ended were up 17.9 percent.    	
<P>
Net income for the quarter just ended was $6.2 million, or 19 cents per share, up from the $1.8 million, or 5 cents per share, earned in the prior year’s third quarter.  The current year’s third quarter includes an after-tax charge to earnings of $840,000, or a reduction of 3 cents per share, in connection with the prior sale of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, MontBell America, Inc.  The prior year’s third quarter included a $1.4 million after-tax benefit to earnings attributable to foreign currency exchange gains, which was recorded as other income. Foreign currency exchange gains or losses occur due to currency market movements and the company’s hedging strategy. 	
<P>

<P>
For the nine months just ended, net sales were $695.4 million, up 10.0 percent from sales of $632.1 million during the same period last year.  Net income for the first nine months of fiscal 1997 was $13.5 million, or 41 cents per share, up from the $4.8 million, or 14 cents per share, earned in the first nine months of the prior year.  	
<P>
The increase in sales during the quarter just ended was mainly due to improvements in overall catalog productivity, or sales per page, particularly in the specialty catalogs, as well as from sales increases in foreign-based operations.  Productivity improvements in the core U.S. business, represented by the monthly and prospecting catalogs, occurred in the last half of the current quarter.  Liquidations of excess inventory were about 13 percent of net sales in the quarter just ended, about the same as in the prior year.  
<P>
	Gross profit in the quarter just ended was $126.1 million, or 43.9 percent of net sales, compared with $99.0 million, or 42.0 percent of net sales, in the similar quarter last year.  The increase in gross profit margin was due to lower merchandise costs, which were primarily the result of sourcing improvements, higher initial markups, and less steep markdowns on liquidated merchandise.  
<P>
	For the third quarter this year, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 19 percent to $115.8 million, compared with $97.5 million for last year’s third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 40.3 percent, compared with 41.3 percent in the similar period last year.  	
<P>
The decrease in the SG&A ratio was primarily the result of greater productivity in the catalogs as shown by increased sales per page mailed.  This was partially offset by increased bonus and profit sharing expenses associated with a higher level of profitability.  	
<P>
The company had about $27 million of short-term debt as of November 1, 1996, compared with $104 million at the end of last year’s third quarter.  Third quarter ending inventory was $207 million, compared with $260 million a year ago.  Lower inventory levels reduce associated interest expenses, but may also result in order fulfillment issues and higher lost sales.  
<P>
	Lands’ End is a direct merchant of traditionally styled, classic casualwear offered to customers through regular mailings of its monthly and specialty catalogs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

RECORD SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS. 	<BR>
    EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 21%.<BR>
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
              Stamford, Vermont, (July 23, 1996) -- Litchfield Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:  LTCH) announced record second quarter net income of $1,564,000, or $.29 per share.  This is a 60% increase over second quarter 1995 net income of $975,000 and a 21% increase over 1995's earnings per share of $.24 per share.
	
<P>
Net income for the six months ended June 30, 1996 increased 76% to $2,362,000 from $1,345,000 in the first half of 1995.  Earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 1996 increased 33% to $.44 per share from $.33 per share for the first six months of 1995.
	
<P>
Total originations for the second quarter increased 85% to $32.6 million from $17.6 million a year earlier, excluding the purchase in April 1995 of  $41.5 million of receivables from GEFCO, a subsidiary of GEICO.  Approximately $15.9 million, or 49%, of the quarter's originations were related to the Company's land loan business, a 37% increase over 1995.  The vacation ownership interest (VOI) business represented approximately $15.7 million, or 48%, of the quarter's originations.   The Company also originated $1.0 million of other secured loans during the quarter.
	
<P>
Litchfield's loan originations for the six months ended June 30, 1996 were $59.0 million, a 50% increase over $39.4 million for the same period the previous year, excluding GEFCO.  Originations for the first six months of 1996 were comprised of $28.8 million of land, $23.6 million of VOIs and $6.6 million of other secured loans.
	
<P>
Randy Stratton, C.E.O. and President of Litchfield, said, "We are pleased with the results for the second quarter, particularly the significant increases in originations and net income.  We are ahead of our origination plans and continue to have strong demand for our land and VOI loans.  Our strong origination network and loan structure have enabled us to build a high-quality serviced portfolio of over $200 million."  Mr. Stratton added, "Looking forward, we will continue to focus on building a high-quality serviced portfolio, growing earnings per share steadily and controlling costs."

<BLOCKQUOTE>    Dear Fellow Stockholder:
<P>

                                          
I am pleased to report another exceptional quarter
for LIN Television.  During this quarter, LIN 
benefited from extremely profitable Olympic 
coverage and Political revenues. LIN also 
showed strength in our non-NBC markets.   

<P>

Third quarter net revenues of $68.8 million 
increased 40% compared to $49.1 million in the
third quarter of 1995.  The increase resulted 
primarily from (i) incremental net revenues 
associated with the broadcast of the summer Olympic games of approximately $4.5 million, (ii) the acquisition of WIVB-TV in Buffalo on October 2, 1995 and (iii) increased network compensation.  Broadcast cash flow grew to $31.2 million in the third quarter, up 29% from $24.1 million in the prior year’s third quarter.  Because 1995 results do not include the operations of WIVB-TV, the current period results are not directly comparable to last year.

<P>

On a pro forma consolidated basis, including the results of the Buffalo station, WIVB-TV, for the same period in the prior year, net revenue for the third quarter increased 26% over pro forma 1995, and broadcast cash flow was up 19%.  Including only the owned affiliate stations, on a pro forma basis, net revenue was up 19% with broadcast cash flow up 24%.  The broadcast cash flow margin for the affiliate group was 52.9% up from 50.8% for the prior year’s quarter on a pro forma basis. 

<P>

For the quarter, net income grew to $9.7 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to $7.9 million, or $0.26 per share for the prior year’s period.  The growth in net income resulted from improved operating performance as well as the factors mentioned above.

<P>

The third quarter also marked the first quarter that the four LMAs on a combined basis were profitable.  This is due in part to the fact that the "launch" LMAs - KNVA-TV (Austin), WBNE-TV (New Haven), and WVBT-TV (Virginia Beach) were, for the first time, all on the air at full power for the entire quarter.  LIN’s year-to-date earnings include approximately $3.8 million in losses in broadcast cash flow relating to the three "launch" LMAs.  In each of these markets,  LIN, with its LMA partners, is creating a new television station which avoids the significant cost of acquiring an existing station in the current market.

<P>

Thank you for your continued support. I look forward to communicating with you in the future.

<P>

Sincerely,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER>  <B>SECOND QUARTER REPORT JUNE 30, 1996
</B></CENTER>
<P>

<B>To Our Shareholders;</B>

<P>

    We are pleased to report our second quarter results.

<P>

    During the three months ended June 30, 1996, funds from operations increased 9% on a per share basis to $0.37, compared with the restated $0.34 per share for the same period a year earlier.  Funds from operations for the second quarter of 1996 were $7.1 million versus $6.1 million for the second quarter of 1995.  Revenues for the quarter increased by 51% to $12.9 million from $8.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 1995.  Net income increased to $5.6 million or $0.30 per share compared with $5.2 million or $0.29 per share for the same period a year earlier.  As previously reported, the Company adopted the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts’ new definition on Funds from Operations effective in January 1996.

<P>

    During the second quarter of 1996, the Company has continued to expand its portfolio of owned properties by acquiring for approximately $54.5 million nine skilled nursing facilities in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas and six assisted living facilities in Texas and Washington, bringing the Company's completed investments in owned properties during 1996 to over $95.6 million and its total owned property portfolio to $212.9 million.  In addition, during the second quarter, the Company funded approximately $21.1 million of mortgage loans bringing the total to $58.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 1996.  Together with the acquisitions, the Company completed investments totaling approximately $153.6 million during the first six months of 1996.  In addition, the Company has recently increased the amounts available under its lines of credit from $119 million to $129 million.  

<P>

    Our investments to date have exceeded the Company’s initial goal for 1996.  As a result of continued growth in our funds from operations per share, for the second consecutive year our Board of Directors has increased the dividend earlier than expected.  In May 1996, the Board declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.34 per share, representing an increase of approximately 8% over the annualized rate of $1.26 per share paid during the previous three quarters.  Historically, the Board has raised the cash dividend during the latter part of the year.

<P>

     For the six months ended June 30, 1996, funds from operations increased 12% to $0.73 per share from a restated $0.65 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1996 were $25.3 million versus $16.1 million for the same period in 1995, an increase of 57%.  Net income increased to $11.1 million or $0.59 per share for the six months ended June 30, 1996 versus $9.9 million or $0.55 per share for the same period in 1995.  The increases in funds from operations, revenues and net income resulted from approximately $218.7 million in investments completed since June 30, 1995.

<P>

    As of July 15, 1996, the Company had outstanding commitments to provide permanent  financing totaling $30.9 million and to acquire 20 long-term care facilities for an aggregate purchase price of $50.6 million.  The Company expects to fund at least $32.6 million of these commitments by the end of 1996.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Dear Stockholder:

<P>

 I am pleased to report that Lydall announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Net income was $5.8 million compared with $5.4 million for the comparable prior-year quarter -- up 6 percent.  On an earnings per-share basis, the Company posted a third-quarter record of $.32 compared with $.30 for the same period last year -- a 7 percent increase.  Sales declined slightly in the quarter -- $59.7 million compared with $61.5 million for the 1995 third quarter.  Gross margin for the quarter was $19.4 million, a record 32.5 percent of sales, compared with $18.9 million, or 30.8 percent of sales, in the third quarter 1995.  After-tax return on sales was 9.7 percent compared with 8.9 percent for the same period last year.

<P>

Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $18.6 million, or $1.03 per share, compared with $16.6 million, or $.91 per share -- a 13 percent increase in earnings per share.  Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 were $193.2 million compared with $189.8 million for the first three quarters of 1995 -- up 2 percent.  Gross margin was $61.7 million, or 31.9 percent of sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 1996, and the after-tax return on sales was 9.6 percent.  For the same nine-month period in 1995, gross margin was $58.2 million, or 30.6 percent of sales, and the after-tax return on sales was 8.8 percent.

<P>

We have enjoyed eleven years of record growth, and we anticipate achieving our twelfth year of growth in 1996. However, the second half of 1996 is proving to be less robust than we had earlier anticipated, and we’re tracking somewhat below our projections for 1996 of earnings per share of about $1.41 and sales in the range of $265 million.  I believe we will earn more in the range of $1.35 to $1.36 per share with sales slightly ahead of last year’s sales of $252.1 million.

<P>

Looking ahead, we have many growth opportunities on the horizon and see this period of slower growth as a temporary plateau.  In the thermal area, sales of automotive heat shields continue to be healthy.  Compared with the same quarter last year, sales of these products for the third quarter of 1996 exhibited double-digit growth, while automotive builds are reported to be up only around 4 percent.  Growth of the battery insulator product line also continues to be good.

<P>

Although high-efficiency air filtration products continue to present opportunities for growth through new product introduction, market penetration, and geographic expansion, sales of these products in the quarter were about equal to the record levels achieved last year.  Air filtration sales have grown at a phenomenal rate over the past two years; however, they slowed modestly in the third quarter.  In general, the long-term trend for this business is very positive 
with demand for clean rooms expanding across a wide variety of industries. In addition, we see opportunities for increasing 
demand in developing countries. The home air filtration market also has  growth potential, domestically and overseas.

<P>

One of Lydall’s more mature businesses, electrical materials sold to the European battery aftermarket, declined in the third quarter 1996 compared with the same quarter last year.

<P>

In addition, sales of material handling products continued to be off from record highs last year.  This has always been a good growth business for Lydall, and it continues to be solid.  Lower sales this year is primarily a deflationary issue.  Raw material prices increased dramatically last year, and we passed through corresponding price increases.  As I’ve said, this is one area of our business where the market pushes for price reductions that directly track decreases in raw material costs.

<P>

Lydall generated operating cash flow of $11.4 million in the third quarter of 1996, bringing operating cash flow year-to-date to a record $36.6 million.  At September 30, 1996, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $37.8 million compared with $28.7 million at the end of 1995.  Working capital was $59.2 million compared with $52.7 million at the end of last year.  The current ratio improved to 2.86 at the end of the third quarter from 2.77 at the end of 1995, and total debt to total capitalization was 7 percent reduced from 9 percent at December 31, 1995.

Stockholders are referred to Lydall’s Form 8-K, filed on June 4, 1996, which outlines certain risks regarding the Company’s forward-looking statements.  Such risks include:  a major downturn of the   U. S. automotive market which accounts for about 30 percent of Lydall’s total sales; a meaningful decrease in the number of clean rooms being built worldwide; and significant, unforeseen changes in raw material pricing, specifically, virgin fiber used in producing the Company’s materials handling slipsheets.  For further details on these risks and other pertinent information on Lydall, copies of the Company’s 10-K, 10-Q’s and 8-K are available on the World Wide Web at Corporate Financials Online (<A HREF="http://www.cfonews.com/ldl">http://www.cfonews.com/ldl</A>).  Copies of these documents can also be obtained from the Company.

<CENTER><B>San Francisco, CA - October 16, 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>

Macromedia (NASDAQ:MACR) today announced that revenues for the second quarter ended September 30, 1996 were $31,025,000, an increase of 14 percent from $27,301,000 in the same period one year ago.

Net income for the quarter was $4,610,000 or $0.12 per share, down 15 percent from the $5,417,000 or $0.15 per share earned in the second quarter of last year, including the one-time merger charge.

<P>

For the six months ended September 30, 1996, revenues totaled $66,035,000, up 29 percent from $51,158,000 reported in the same period one year ago. Operating income for the six months ended September 30, 1996, was $14,408,000, up 21 percent from the $11,956,000 reported for the same period one year ago, including a one-time merger charge of $400,000.

"During the second quarter, we were pleased to see continued demand for our Windows products, as well as the growing contribution from international sales," said Bud Colligan, Chairman of Macromedia. "Windows products accounted for 49% of overall sales during the quarter and were up 46% year to year. In the next quarter we will begin to benefit from sales of the new FreeHand Graphics Studio 7, containing the latest versions of FreeHand, Extreme 3D and xRes.  All of these products have been optimized for both print and the Internet and leverage Macromedia’s Shockwave franchise. With the FreeHand Graphics Studio shipping, we expect Macintosh sales to rebound in fiscal Q3," said Colligan.

<P>

<B>NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS</B><BR>
In September, over 6,000 people attended the Macromedia User Conference and Exhibition, where Macromedia announced the FreeHand Graphics Studio 7, powerful design tools for Internet, Shockwave and print publishing. The new Studio contains new FreeHand 7, new Macromedia xRes 3, new Extreme 3D 2 and Fontographer 4.1. The Studio features four seamlessly integrated, cross-platform 2D and 3D tools for creating designs that support powerful Internet graphics and standards such as Shockwave, transparent GIFs, progressive JPEG, VRML for 3D imaging and URL embedding for hotlinks. The FreeHand Graphics Studio is expected to begin shipping in November. In a related release, Macromedia announced that the FreeHand Graphics Studio 7 will deliver on the four pillars of the Macromedia Studios Architecture, previewed at last year’s conference. Macromedia User Interface (MUI), Macromedia Open Architecture (MOA), Macromedia Exchange (MIX) and Macromedia Scripting (MCS) provide a fully integrated set of tools sharing a common user interface, extensible open architecture, rich media exchange and scriptability through Java. Also at the User Conference, Macromedia further established its leadership position in providing powerful, high-value solutions to the interactive information marketplace by announcing new pricing for the Authorware Interactive Studio.

<P>

In July, Macromedia announced and shipped the latest version of Shockwave, the Company’s technology for expanding and optimizing digital media access on the Internet. Shockwave’s new audio capabilities bring voice- to CD-quality streaming audio and up to 176:1 compression to the web for the first time. Also in July, Macromedia announced and made available AppletAce, the first Java application which allows designers and graphic artists to easily enhance their Web sites without HTML or Java programming.

<P>

<B>PARTNERSHIPS</B><BR>
At the Macromedia User Conference, Macromedia and Netscape Communications announced a comprehensive licensing and distribution agreement to advance the use of multimedia on the Internet. Netscape plans to incorporate both Macromedia’s Shockwave plug-in and Fireworks, Macromedia’s high performance, Java-based content API, into the Netscape Navigator client software product line. Also at the User Conference, Macromedia and Intel announced that Director would be the first multimedia and web authoring tool optimized for Intel’s MMX technology. The announcement enables animation and multimedia playback performance up to 50% faster for both Director and Shockwave movies.

<P>

This quarter, Macromedia continued making partnerships that extend the reach of Shockwave. As of the end of September, more than 11 million downloads of Shockwave had occurred. Netscape Communications has licensed Shockwave to include with its Netscape Navigator Personal Edition, the top selling retail software package for consumers to access and browse the World Wide Web. In addition, CompuServe plans to distribute Shockwave through its WOW! consumer online service. Finally, @Home Network and Continental Cablevision have licensed Shockwave for distribution to its customers as part of its high speed cable modem network and service.

<P>

<B>NEW PRESIDENT</B><BR>
In August, Macromedia announced that Rob Burgess was named President of the company, effective November 1, 1996. Mr. Burgess comes to Macromedia from Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), where he was Senior Vice President. Prior to this most recent role, Mr. Burgess was President of Alias/Wavefront, a wholly-owned software subsidiary of SGI, and was previously President and CEO of Alias from 1992 to 1995, when it was an independent, publicly-traded company on the NASDAQ Stock Market. As President, Mr. Burgess will be responsible for the operating results of the company and will join the Board of Directors. Bud Colligan, formerly Chairman and President, will continue as Chairman and focus on strategy, corporate development and financial and industry relations.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>DEAR SHAREHOLDERS:</B>
<P>


The past quarter has seen progress in several of our research and development programs, and further expansion of our management team.
<P>

<B>MSI-78</B><BR>


We have recently completed enrollment in the first of two clinical trials of our lead product candidate MSI-78, being tested in the treatment of infection in diabetic foot ulcers.  Enrollment in the second trial is proceeding and we expect to release results later this year for both studies.
<P>

<B>Squalamine</B><BR>

At the annual meeting of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons in Minneapolis, Dr. Henry Brem and Dr. Allen Sills of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, along with collaborators from Magainin, reported that squalamine, in animal testing, exerts a significant effect on solid tumor growth.  Studies in over 60 rabbits demonstrated the ability of squalamine to suppress the growth of implanted rectal carcinoma through a mechanism involving specific suppression of new blood vessels needed to support the growth of the tumor.  The mechanism by which squalamine exerts its effect appears to be via a novel receptor-based inhibition of a membrane protein which controls cellular acidity.  Magainin expects to concentrate development efforts on the treatment of diseases caused by pathological angiogenesis, focusing initially on therapy for certain solid tumors.
<P>

<B>Cystic Fibrosis Program</B><BR>

Preclinical efforts continue on the Company's aerosolized magainin peptide intended for the treatment of infection in cystic fibrosis patients.  The Company has begun to explore the feasibility of a more convenient dry powder inhalation formulation and preclinical activities are expected to carry into 1997.
<P>

<B>Personnel</B><BR>


Mr. Thomas J. Bigger joined Magainin in July as Senior Vice President Business Development, Marketing and Sales.  Mr. Bigger has over eighteen years experience in the pharmaceutical industry, including having served as President of Dermik Laboratories. Mr. Bigger will be responsible for identifying and developing new business opportunities, and the coordination of the Company's marketing and sales efforts.
<P>

<B>Financial Review</B><BR>


The Company reported a net loss of approximately $6.2 million and $12.5 million, or $(.36) and $(.73) per share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 1996 as compared to a net loss of approximately $4.0 million and $7.5 million, or $(.30) and $(.57) per share for the corresponding periods in the prior year.  The increased losses principally reflect increased manufacturing development and clinical expenses associated with MSI-78.  The Company's cash and investments position at June 30, 1996 is approximately $33 million.
<P>


Thank you for your continued support.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>FIRST QUARTER REPORT 1997</B></CENTER><P>

To MagneTek Securityholders:

<P>


 MagneTek earned $4.3 million, or $.17 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, which ended on September 30, 1996, compared with a loss of $3.5 million, or $.14 per share, in last year’s first quarter.
	
<P>
MagneTek’s total revenue and operating profit in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 were $291.4 million and $15.9 million, respectively, against $272.7 million and $5.2 million in the same period last year.  Gross profit increased to 19% of sales from 16% a year ago.
	
<P>
All three of the company’s business segments reported improved sales and profits. The Lighting Products segment, which produced 41% of total revenue in the first quarter, accounted for most of the year-over-year improvement, with a 95% gain in gross profit on a 12% sales increase.  The Motors & Controls segment  (45% of revenue) had a 10% increase in profit on a 3% sales increase, related primarily to strong demand for fractional-horsepower motors.  Profit-ability of the Power Supplies segment  (14% of revenue) increased slightly on an 8% increase in sales, reflecting demand growth in both Europe and the U.S.
	
<P>
MagneTek also strengthened its balance sheet during the first quarter, using cash flow from operations and reductions in working capital to cut debt by $12 million.
	
<P>
MagneTek’s first-quarter revenue increase reflects year-over-year market demand growth in all three business segments.  However, the company’s profit improvement is primarily attrib-utable to increased operating efficiency rather than to market factors.  As noted in our fiscal 1996 Annual Report*, all of us at MagneTek are working hard to eliminate internal inefficiencies while building on the company’s external strengths, and I believe the results are beginning to show it.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Oskaloosa, Iowa, July 18, 1996 -- Mahaska Investment Company today reported that net income for the quarter ended June 30, 1996 increased 10% to $1,262,000 ($.56 per share) compared with net income of $1,147,000 ($.50 per share) earned during the second quarter of 1995.  The net income of $1,262,000 is the highest quarterly earnings amount ever recorded by the Company.  A 24% increase in average loans outstanding during the second quarter of 1996 contributed significantly to the Company's overall increase in net income for the period.  For the first six months of 1996, net income increased 15% to $2,268,000 ($1.00 per share) compared with $1,975,000 ($.86 per share) earned for the first six months of 1995. 

<P>

Total assets of the Company increased to $249,804,000 as of June 30, 1996, as one of the Company's subsidiaries (Central Valley Bank) completed the acquisition of the Sigourney, Iowa office of Boatmen's Bank Iowa, N.A. (Boatmen's) on June 21, 1996.  Central Valley Bank assumed approximately $32.6 million in deposits from Boatmen's and acquired $14.7 million in loans.  Total assets of the Company increased $44.6 million (22%) from December 31, 1995, and increased $54.8 million (28%) from June 30, 1995.

Mr. Robert H. Halleck, President<BR>

3505 Hamilton Street<BR>
Hyattsville, MD  20782<BR>
(301)779-1200<P>

<B>Stock Listing</B><BR>
The common stock of Maryland Federal Bancorp, Inc. is quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System under the symbol "MFSL".  As of  September 30, 1996, there were 3,851,737 shares issued, of which 2,980,561 were outstanding.


<P>

<CENTER><B>Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 1997</B></CENTER>


<P>

For the three months ended August 31, 1996, Maryland Federal Bancorp, Inc. had net income of $1,920,000.  Primary earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 were $ .61.  During the same period last year, the earnings of $2,420,000 included $880,000 of gains on the sale of securities.  There were no such gains in the second quarter of fiscal 1997.  Primary earnings per share for the three months ended August 31, 1995, were $ .75, which included $ .27 per share of gains on the sale of investment securities.

<P>

On August 15, 1996, our Board of Directors increased the annual cash dividend by  $ .02  per share  from $ .64 to $ .66 for the year.  The new quarterly dividend was paid on September 13, 1996 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 30, 1996.  During the quarter which ended August 31, 1996, Maryland Federal substantially completed its goal to repurchase 200,000 shares of its common stock.  The remaining shares needed to reach that goal were repurchased early in the quarter which will end November 30, 1996.

<P>

Net interest income after provision for loan losses for the second quarter ended August 31, 1996, was $7,383,000, compared with $6,765,000 reported in the second quarter a year ago.  For the six months ended August 31, 1996, net interest income after provision for loan losses increased 6.1 percent to $14,494,000 from $13,657,000 for the same period last year.

<P>

We are comfortable with the results of our strategy to increase net interest income.  Home equity lines of credit now exceed $40,000,000 in outstandings.  We are increasing low cost transaction accounts at an annualized rate exceeding 20 percent.  During the third quarter ending November 30, 1996, we will be introducing our debit card and increasing the fees on our commercial checking accounts.  These changes along with the new fee for noncustomers at our ATMs will meaningfully increase our fee income.

<P>

We look forward to more progress in the future.  Thank you for your support and your business.  Please contact us if you have any questions or comments.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES AND FRIENDS:</B>
<P>


	<B>Overview and Summary of Financial Results</B> -- Marine Drilling's third quarter results represent the Company’s best quarterly earnings in over a decade and reflect continuing improvement in jack-up rig day rates in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. During the third quarter, the Company reported net income of $6,690,000 or $.15 per share on revenues of $29,819,000 compared with a net loss of $597,000 on revenues of $15,490,000 ($.01 per share) in the same quarter a year ago.  Our improved results were attributable to the following factors:  (i) a 41% increase in average day rates from $17,712 in 1995 to $24,932 in 1996, (ii) an increase in the number of marketed rigs from 10 in 1995 to 13 in 1996 and (iii) an increase in utilization of marketed rigs from 95% in 1995 to 100% in 1996.
	
<P>
<B>Third Quarter Market Review</B> -- During the third quarter of 1996, an average of 120 jack-up rigs were working in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico resulting in an overall rig utilization of 88%.  Worldwide jack-up utilization continued at 86% during this period.  The Company's 13 marketed rigs were 100% utilized during the third quarter at an average day rate of $24,932 compared to 100% utilization of 13 marketed rigs and an average day rate of $23,505 experienced during the second quarter.   

<P>
	<B>Recent Developments</B> -- During August, the Company purchased the MARINE 305, formerly known as the Odin Princess.  This 300 foot independent leg slot rig was acquired for $8,000,000 consisting of $500,000 cash and the issuance of approximately 882,000 shares of common stock. We recently committed resources to refurbish the rig and upgrade its operational characteristics.  This project will include the addition of a cantilever feature to the rig as well as the installation of a top drive drilling system. We currently expect to complete this project by mid-1997, at which time we hope to have a long term contract in place for the employment of the rig.

<P>
	On November 12, the Company announced the acquisition of the Chris Chenery, a second generation semisubmersible currently configured to operate in water depths up to 600 feet.  At this time, we expect to close this transaction by year-end and to have the rig employed as soon as possible thereafter.

<P>
	<B>Outlook for the Remainder of the Year</B> -- The Company is developing a backlog of drilling contracts with generally higher day rates which continue to strengthen due to worldwide improvement in jack-up rig demand.  The Company’s Gulf of Mexico rigs are essentially contracted through the fourth quarter and well into the first quarter of next year at generally increasing day rates.  About half of our Gulf of Mexico rigs are operating under short to intermediate term contracts, most of which include repricing mechanisms allowing us to take advantage of any future changes in day rates.  Our rig operating in India, the MARINE 201, is expected to remain under its current contract through November 1997 due to our customer’s recent exercise of their contract options to that date.  Over the next few weeks we will be seeking longer term contracts for the MARINE 305 and the MARINE 500 (currently known as the Chris Chenery).
 
<P>

	<B>Strategic Direction </B>-- Recognizing the strategic value of our Gulf of Mexico operations, we have recently decided that the best way to maximize the value of the Company is for us to maintain our current level of rigs in this market.  While we believe that this component of our operations has significant upside, we feel that it is prudent to hedge that component by adding longer term contracts to the Company’s portfolio.  It is our belief that these contracts are best obtained by acquiring additional assets, particularly deepwater assets for domestic and/or international term contracts and jack-up rigs for international term contracts.  Our goal is to acquire enough assets to double our revenue base from the current level and to earn approximately half of our revenue stream each from shorter term contracts in the Gulf of Mexico and longer term contracts worldwide.  Our latest acquisitions provide a good start toward this goal. We will keep you posted on our efforts in this regard.
	
<P>
Thank you for your continuing support.

 	Richmond, VA, October 28, 1996 --- (NASDAQ - MAKL)  <B>Markel Corporation</B> announced higher earnings from core operations  for the quarter and nine month period ended September 30, 1996.  Alan I. Kirshner, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Underwriting profitability in the third quarter was significant considering the quarter included losses from Hurricane Fran.   Despite the competitive market, our year-to-date underwriting results continue to improve." 
	
<P>
In evaluating its operating performance, the Company focuses on core underwriting and investing results before consideration of realized investment gains, amortization expenses, and nonrecurring items.  Third quarter income from core operations increased 13 percent to $1.54 per primary share from $1.36 per primary share in 1995.  For the nine month period, core operating income rose 14 percent to $4.18 per primary share from $3.68 per primary share a year ago.  The growth in both periods resulted primarily from higher net investment income.  
	
<P>
Third quarter earned premiums were $76.9 million, up slightly from $75.7 million last year.  For the nine month period, earned premiums increased 7 percent to $225.1 million from $209.9 million in 1995.  In response to intense market competition, the Company has focused on its underwriting standards at the expense of growth in premium volume.
	
<P>
Underwriting performance is measured by the combined ratio of losses and expenses to earned premiums.  For the quarter, the combined ratio was flat at 99 percent compared to 1995. The combined ratio was 100 percent for the nine month period compared to 99 percent a year ago.  The Company’s loss ratio was 66 percent for the third quarter compared to 65 percent in 1995.  The 1996 third quarter loss ratio includes $1.7 million, or $.23 per primary share, in property losses from Hurricane Fran.  Hurricane losses were partially offset by favorable development in other lines of business.  For the nine month period, the loss ratio rose to 67 percent from 65 percent a year ago as a result of reserve increases in the medical malpractice book of business and property losses from the winter storms and Hurricane Fran.  The third quarter and nine month expense ratios fell to 33 percent from 34 percent in 1995.  The decrease in both periods is the result of the recognition of contingent profit commissions partially offset by higher acquisition costs and start-up costs in several new programs.           
	
<P>
Third quarter net investment income was $12.4 million compared to $12.1 million in 1995.  For the nine month period, net investment income was up 20% to $36.5 million compared to $30.5 million in 1995.  The increase is primarily the result of the Company’s larger investment portfolio.
 	
<P>
Realized gains totaled $0.4 million for the quarter and $3.0 million for the nine month period compared to $3.0 million for the third quarter and $7.7 million for the nine month period last year.  Variability in the timing of realized  and unrealized investment gains is to be expected and often results from interest rate volatility which impacts the market values of fixed maturity and equity investments.
	
<P>
As previously reported in the second quarter of 1996, the Company recognized a nonrecurring benefit of $18.4 million, or $3.25 per primary share, related to the recognition of tax benefits attributable to certain differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets acquired in a prior period.  This benefit was recognized when management determined that estimated tax liabilities were less than amounts previously accrued.
	
<P>
Third quarter net income was $8.5 million, or $1.50 per primary share, compared to net income of $9.0 million, or $1.59 per primary share last year.  Third quarter net income fell due to lower realized gains which were partially offset by continued underwriting profitability and growth in net investment income.  For the nine month period, net income after nonrecurring items was $42.4 million, or $7.50 per primary share, compared to $23.9 million, or $4.26 per primary share in 1995. 
	
<P>
The Company reported net unrealized gains, net of taxes, on its fixed maturity and equity investments of $25.2 million at September 30, 1996, compared to net unrealized gains, net of taxes, of $34.0 million at December 31, 1995.  The decrease was primarily the result of rising interest rates which reduced the value of the Company’s fixed maturity investments.  Book value per common share was $45.36 at September 30, 1996 compared to $39.37 at December 31, 1995.
	
<P>
The Company has received all necessary regulatory approvals for its $38 million purchase of Investors Insurance Group (Investors).  The purchase is expected to close on October 31, 1996.

<B>MARTEK ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 1996 FINANCIAL RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

COLUMBIA, MD -- September 5, 1996:  Martek Biosciences Corporation (NASDAQ: MATK) today announced third quarter 1996 revenues of $422,000 and a net loss of $2,859,000, or $.22 per share.  Revenues for the nine months ended July 31, 1996 were $3,510,000 and a net loss of $5,933,000, or $.45 per share, was recorded.

<P>

Revenues for the quarter and nine months ended July 31, 1996, were $422,000 and $3,510,000, respectively.  These revenues represent an increase of 29% from the third quarter 1995, and an increase of 129% from the nine months ended July 31, 1995.  For the quarter, the improvement in revenues is due primarily to receipts in connection with increased work on several government contracts.  For the nine-month period, the revenue increase resulted from the recognition of $2,075,000 in license fees during the first quarter of 1996 that were previously recorded as unearned pending the lapse of certain conditions contained in the related license agreement.  Product sales during the third quarter ended July 31, 1996 increased by 11% from the same period in 1995 due primarily to increased sales of Formulaid® and Neuromins, which more than offset a slight decrease in sales of carbon-13 products.  For the nine-month period, product sales decreased 24% due to lower prices caused by continued competition for  carbon-13 products.  Revenues from research and development contracts and grants increased by 106% in the third quarter of 1996 and 29% during the nine months ended July 31, 1996 when compared with the third quarter and nine months ended July 31, 1995, respectively. 

<P>

R & D costs increased significantly, consistent with the Company's efforts to optimize oil production quickly and develop an in-house oil processing capability.  R & D costs increased by $502,000, or 25%, in the third quarter of 1996 and $1,858,000, or 33%, during the nine months ended July 31, 1996 over the third quarter and nine months ended July 31, 1995, respectively.  Research and development costs were also increased for the nine-month period as the result of a program to qualify additional manufacturing sources for Martek's nutritional oils.  Production development and other oils-related development costs comprised over 75% of research and development expenses for the first nine months of 1996. 

<P>

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $401,000, or 53%, during the third quarter of 1996 and $804,000, or 34%, in the nine months ended July 31, 1996 over the third quarter and nine months ended July 31, 1995, respectively.  These costs increased primarily due to:  costs associated with the public awareness campaign for DHA; other Formulaid and Neuromins marketing costs; and, increased insurance and other corporate overhead costs.  Other income was $402,000 higher during the third quarter of 1996 than in the third quarter of 1995 and $1,414,000 higher in the first nine months of 1996 than in the first nine months of 1995 mainly due to interest earned on the investment of funds received in the Company's 1995 public offering.

<P>

Net loss for the third quarter of 1996 was $2,859,000, or $.22 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,401,000, or $.24 for the same period in 1995.  This increase in net loss resulted from increased research and development, marketing and public relations campaign expenses primarily relating to efforts to commercialize Formulaid.  A net loss of $5,933,000, or $.45 per share for the nine-month period ended July 31, 1996, was a decrease from a net loss of $6,662,000, or $.75 per share, for the same period in 1995.  This decrease reflects the anniversary license fee recognized in the first quarter of 1996 which more than offset increased research and development expenses in the 1996 period.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Third Quarter Report 1996</B>


<P>

Dear Matrix Stockholder:

<P>

The third quarter of 1996 was a time for continued growth at Matrix, and we are pleased to report to you on our progress.

<P>

Market launch for AccuSite™ Injectable Gel in the United Kingdom for the treatment of genital warts is on schedule for 1997.  This will be an important milestone for Matrix as it represents our first revenue opportunity.  We have conducted market research to determine the best strategies for market penetration and continued our efforts to establish a sales force in the U.K. 
and to implement a distribution network in several other European countries.  Our marketing applications in France, Germany, Italy and Sweden are currently under review and our "mutual recognition" filings for other European member states are also under preparation.  In the United States, review of our New Drug Application (NDA) is ongoing, and we anticipate approval in 1997.

<P>

As part of the AccuSite European pre-launch activities, we are engaged in medical educational programs to inform physicians and patients about the features and benefits of AccuSite for the treatment of genital warts.  In October, we hosted a satellite symposium at the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) in Lisbon, Portugal.  We also presented at the German Sexually Transmitted Disease Society Meeting in Rostock, Germany.  These and similar meetings provide Matrix with a forum to educate European clinicians about the use of AccuSite to treat genital warts, a disease inadequately managed by existing therapies.

<P>

In September, the Company updated the status of its basal cell cancer program, the second indication of our AccuSite product.  An interim analysis of data from a Phase III five-year recurrence study showed that AccuSite achieved a high level of efficacy in treating basal cell cancer lesions.  However, the response rate was not as high as in the Phase II trial the Company conducted in basal cell cancer and was not comparable to response rates perceived to be obtained by surgical procedures.  In view of these interim data and previously-reported results from the composition-of-components trials in this indication, we currently believe that it will be difficult to commerialize this program.  We plan to follow patients for at least the first year of the protocol in an effort to evaluate longer-term response rates.

<P>

We are pleased to report noteworthy progress in expanding our IntraDose™ cancer program.  We are on schedule for the initiation of a Phase II protocol of IntraDose Injectable Gel for patients with primary liver cancer, which should begin before the end of this year.  We plan to follow this study with another Phase II trial next year, this time for patients with metastatic cancer to their liver.  We continue to enroll patients in the Phase III trials being conducted in the U.S. and Europe for patients with head and neck cancer and other accessible tumors and expect to complete this study in 1997.

<P>

We are preparing to take our next generation of products following AccuSite and IntraDose into clinical trials.  Encouraged by excellent preclinical data, we have selected our radiosensitizer, MPI 5020, to be the subject of our next Investigational New Drug (IND) filing in early 1997.  Phase I clinical trials should begin shortly thereafter.  

<P>

For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the Company reported a net loss of $6,812,000 or $0.32 per share, compared to a net loss of $8,672,000 or $0.76 per share for the same quarter in 1995.  For the first nine months of 1996, the Company reported a net loss of $21,096,000 or $1.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $19,511,000 or $1.78 per share for the same period in 1995.  We ended the quarter with approximately $121,300,000 in cash and marketable securities.

<P>

 
In closing, we would like to express our gratitude for your continued interest and support of Matrix Pharmaceutical.

THIRD QUARTER OF 1996<P>

</B></CENTER>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
FREMONT, Calif., October 22, 1996 --  Mattson Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:MTSN), a leading supplier of advanced process technology for semiconductor manufacturing, today announced  financial results for its third quarter of 1996

<P>

Sales for the third quarter of 1996 were $14.0 million, compared to $15.1 million for the third quarter of 1995, a decrease of seven percent.  The Company recorded a net loss for the third quarter of $0.1 million or 1 cent per share, compared to net income of $3.1 million or 20 cents per share for  the third quarter of 1995.  Third quarter bookings were $14.4 million, a decrease of 32 percent from the third quarter of 1995 and backlog increased 34 percent to $39.5 million compared to $29.5 million at the third quarter of 1995.

<P>

Quarter to quarter sales decreased 40 percent, down from $23.2 million in the second quarter of 1996.  Net loss for the third quarter of $0.1 million, or 1 cent per share,  represents a decrease from net income of $3.5 million, or 23 cents per share, last quarter.  Bookings decreased 29 percent, down from $20.3 million in the second quarter of 1996, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.0 to 1.0.  The Company believes that the decrease in bookings is attributable to the general decline being experienced by the Semiconductor Industry, particularly resulting from lower demand from manufacturers of DRAMs.   

<P>

This Press Release contains forward looking statements regarding, among other matters, the Company’s future financial performance.  Forward looking statements address matters which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.  In addition to the general risks associated with the development of complex technology, future results of the Company will depend on a variety of factors, including the timing of significant orders, the ability of the Company to bring new systems to market, the timing of new product releases by the Company’s competitors, slowdowns in the semiconductor industry, and other competitive factors.  Reference is made to the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for further discussion of risks and uncertainties regarding the Company’s business.

<B>Results for the Quarter Ended July 31, 1996</B>
<P>


McWhorter Technologies, Inc. today reported net income of $4,360,000, or 42 cents per share, for the quarter ended July 31, 1996, compared to prior year net income of $3,294,000, or 30 cents per share, an increase of 40 percent over the prior year net income per share.  The Company's share repurchase program had a favorable impact of 2 cents per share in the third quarter of 1996.  Net sales were $87,144,000, a 5 percent increase from last year's net sales.
<P>

Net income for the nine months ended July 31, 1996 was $9,675,000, or 92 cents per share, compared to prior year net income of $7,907,000, or 73 cents per share, an increase of 26 percent over the prior year net income per share.  Net sales for the nine months were $229,301,000 versus $229,403,000 for the comparable period a year ago.
<P>

Commenting on the Company's performance for the third quarter, John Stevenson, McWhorter Technologies President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Favorable market conditions led to a 7 percent volume increase in the third quarter excluding the impact of the Columbus facility acquisition.  All of our businesses contributed to the volume growth during the  quarter.  Margin improvement was primarily a result of stable raw material pricing and ongoing internal process improvements.  A modest improvement in volume is expected for the full year."
<P>

McWhorter is one of the leading manufacturers of resins used in the paint and coatings industry in the United States and is a manufacturer of resins used in the reinforced fiberglass plastics industry.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER> <B>1996 THIRD QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>

<P>
To Our Shareowners:

<P>

 	We are pleased to report our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 1996, highlighted by improved earnings, record revenues, higher home closings, improved gross profit margins, increased backlog, the sale of our asset management subsidiary, Financial Asset Management LLC ("FAMC"), and continued success in strengthening our balance sheet and controlling our costs of doing business.
	
<P>
Our operating results improved for the third quarter and first nine months of 1996 with operating income, before extraordinary items, of $5.6 million and $14.5 million, or 27 cents and 68 cents per share (fully diluted), respectively, compared with $5.5 million and $13.9 million, or 25 cents and 63 cents per share (fully diluted), respectively, for the same periods in 1995.  These improved 1996 results were achieved despite the adverse impact of non-cash pre-tax charges in the second and third quarters, totalling $7.2 million, for the impairment of certain homebuilding assets.  The impairment charges were required primarily with respect to certain assets in the Mid-Atlantic region as a result of our stated objective of exiting under-performing subdivisions in that market.  While intending to maintain market share in the Mid-Atlantic region, we are eliminating lower margin projects and redeploying capital to our more profitable operations.

<P>

<B>Record Revenues and Higher Home Closings</B><BR>
	Our 	revenues in the first nine months of 1996 exceeded all comparable periods in our history, increasing to $670 million from $639 million for the same period in 1995, due primarily to the increase in homes closed.  We closed 3,606 homes in the first nine months of 1996, an increase of seven percent over homes closed in the comparable period in 1995.
	
<P>
Our homebuilding operations generated operating profits, before asset impairment charges, of $9.2 million and $25.2 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months  of 1996, compared with $10.5 million and $27.5 million, respectively, for the same periods in 1995.  Our homebuilding gross profit margins improved to 13.8 percent and 13.6 percent, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1996, compared with 13.4 percent for the same periods in 1995. Consistent with our objective of building more affordable housing, our average selling price of homes closed in the first nine months of 1996 declined to $176,200 from $180,900 for the same period in 1995.
<P>

	Our home sales during the first nine months of 1996 increased 10 percent to 4,040 units, compared with 3,679 homes sold during the same period in 1995, primarily as a result of increased home sales activity produced by our expanding operations in Southern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas.  As a result of these increased sales, our homes under contract (backlog) at September 30, 1996 increased to 1,845 units with an estimated sales value of $326 million, up 36 percent and eight percent, respectively, from the backlog at December 31, 1995 and September 30, 1995.

<P>

<B>Increased Financial Services Operating Profits</B><BR>
	Operating profits from our financial services segment were $7.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1996, compared with $3.5 million and $10.9 million for the same periods in 1995.  The increases in operating profits were primarily due to the $4.0 million pre-tax gain, net of related expenses, recorded for the sale of FAMC. Our mortgage lending operations have continued to produce strong results, with a record $343 million of mortgage loans originated for MDC home buyers for the first nine months of 1996.  These record originations resulted primarily from the high level of closings and the significant increase in our capture rate of MDC home buyers.

<P>

<B>Improved Operating Efficiency</B><BR>
	During 1996, we continued to be successful in controlling administrative expenses and reducing interest costs.  Our corporate and homebuilding interest incurred decreased 11 percent for the first nine months of 1996, compared with 1995, resulting from lower effective interest rates on our variable-rate debt and lower average outstanding borrowings.  In addition, our corporate general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of 1996 were lower by 13 percent than the first nine months of 1995, due primarily to an insurance recovery of $1.3 million received in the first quarter of 1996.
	
<P>
We are proud of our continued progress in strengthening our financial position in preparation for the future challenges and opportunities presented by our markets and our industry.  With our recent sale of FAMC, we will be able to focus our full attention on our core homebuilding and mortgage lending businesses.  This concentrated operating focus will enable us to better achieve our primary goal of maximizing shareowner value.
<P>

	Thank you for your continued support.

<P>

Sincerely,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>To Our Shareowners:

<P>

	The Mead Corporation reported third quarter net earnings of $62.7 million, or $1.18 per share, compared to $104.5 million, or $1.91 per share, for the same period in 1995.  Sales for the quarter were $1.23 billion versus $1.35 billion in 1995.
<P>

	Although sales and earnings were lower for each business segment compared to last year, demand continued to strengthen for many of Mead's products during the quarter.  Shipments of coated paper reached record levels, and the company's mills and facilities operated very well.  Earnings, however, were below last year's record third quarter, reflecting weaker market prices for pulp, paper and corrugating medium.
<P>

	The sales volume of coated papers continued to be very strong during the quarter, reaching record levels.  However, weakening prices, which began in the fourth quarter of last year, continued and led to overall lower earnings in the segment.  Sales volume continued to be strong in carbonless paper.  The Specialty Paper and Gilbert Paper divisions improved sales and earnings over last year. 
<P>

	Sales and earnings for the Coated Board System were ahead of last year.  Packaging results were slightly ahead of last year as operating performance continued to improve.  Stronger North American volume was partly offset by weakness in Europe.   Results from wood operations improved, and the Mahrt Mill in Phenix City, Alabama, operated extremely well.  The Containerboard Division's earnings were affected by continued weak pricing for medium and containers and expensing of the startup costs associated with a new corrugating medium machine at the Stevenson, Alabama, mill.  
<P>

	The School and Office Products Division completed a very strong back-to-school season.  During the quarter, the division operated well and continued to enhance its responsiveness to customers.
<P>

	Zellerbach sales were below last year as a result of lower market prices and printing paper volumes.  Operating margin rates improved.  Orders for printing paper and packaging began to strengthen late in the quarter.
<P>

	Mead's jointly owned Northwood companies achieved positive earnings following two quarters of losses.  Higher volumes and stronger prices for wood products, and a strengthening in pulp prices, led to the improved results.  
<P>

	1996 will be a year of progress for Mead.  We are distinguishing ourselves in the market through our continued focus on controllables and value-added products.   We see a mixed recovery from our current depressed markets with signs of strengthening in some areas and continued instability in others.

<P>

<U>Other news</U><BR>
	The company completed the sale of its discontinued reinsurance business on October 1 with no impact on earnings.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Shareholder:

<P>

We are pleased to report growth in earnings for the second quarter ended June 30.   Net income for the three month period totaled $1.001 million, or $0.09 per share, and $1.560 million, or $0.14 per share, for the first six months of 1996, compared to losses of $2.023 million, or ($0.18) per share, and $2.335 million, or ($0.21) per share, for the respective periods of the previous year.  Income for the quarter included the one time non-recurring $350,000 ($0.03 per share) paid to Medco Research by Boehringer Mannheim Pharmaceuticals Corporation upon the termination of a licensing agreement and Medco’s reacquisition of marketing rights for BiDilâ.  

<P>

The Company’s royalty revenues were $3.293 million and $6.040 million, an increase of 17 percent and 14 percent for the second quarter and first six months, respectively, over comparable periods of 1995.  Adenoscanâ and Adenocardâ sales for the second quarter were $7.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Total adenosine sales (Adenoscan and Adenocard) were $13.4 million and $24.5 for the second quarter and six months, compared to $ 11.5 million and $21.6 for the year earlier periods.  The gross margin (royalty revenue less royalty expense) for the second quarter and first six months increased 82 percent and 76 percent, respectively, from the prior year periods. We are particularly pleased to report that Adenoscan sales increased 29 percent over the first quarter.

<P>

Research and development costs were $1.380 million and $2.758 million for the second quarter and first six months of 1996, as compared to $2.107 and $3.627 million for the year earlier periods, a decrease of 35 percent and 24 percent, respectively.  Research and development spending for the period reflects the early development status of the current portfolio subsequent to the recent filing of our ViaScint and BiDil New Drug Applications (NDAs).  General and administrative expenses were $1.013 million and $1.692 million for the second quarter and first six months of 1996, as compared to $1.906 and $2.519 million for the year earlier periods, a decrease of 47 percent and 33 percent, respectively.  Working capital plus investments were $36.354 million or $3.32 per share.

<P>

<B>Portfolio Developments</B>

<P>

The past several months have witnessed the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort and energy on the part of our research and development staff, in particular.  Within a period of ten weeks the Company submitted NDAs for ViaScintä (iodeconic acid I 123) Injection and BiDilâ (hydralazine hydrochloride and isosorbide dinitrate) Tablets.  The Company takes pride in the fact that it has filed four NDAs over a period of eight years.  This rate of productivity is enviable and attests to the Company’s proven ability to move products through the development pipeline in an expeditious manner.

<P>

<B>ViaScint</B>

<P>

ViaScint represents the Company’s second entry into the nuclear cardiology field.  We believe this safe and easy-to-use radiopharmaceutical, in the event it receives marketing clearance from the FDA, could assist physicians in determining which patients may be spared a serious, high risk and costly surgery that may yield no clinical benefit.  The availability of such a diagnostic technique could reduce the number of unnecessary coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery procedures and thereby result in a substantial savings to the healthcare system.

<P>

<B>BiDil</B>

<P>

Marketing clearance is being sought for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) as an adjunct to standard therapy in patients who are intolerant or have a contraindication to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.   Although ACE inhibitors are considered first line therapy, there is currently no approved alternative for patients who are not suitable candidates for treatment with ACE inhibitors.  For such patients, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate are recognized by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association as the recommended treatment, and BiDil provides an appropriate dose of this therapy in a single tablet.

<P>

<B>Corporate Developments</B>

<P>

In May Medco Research and Fujisawa USA signed a Joint Development Agreement  (JDA) to develop adenosine as a cardioprotectant in the settings of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and acute myocardial infarction (MI).  Under the JDA, the companies have combined their intellectual properties for these applications of adenosine.  Currently, three Phase II multicenter trials are underway.  The companies will share equally all research and development expenses.  The combined research and development funding for 1996 will not exceed $4 million and therefore the Company’s share will not exceed $2 million for the year.   Fujisawa will have exclusive worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights, and the Company will receive royalties of 25% of net sales in the U.S., Canada and Mexico and 50% of net profits from other foreign sales.

<P>

Efforts are ongoing to secure commercial partners for BiDil and ViaScint.  The Company is  actively engaged in discussions with several major pharmaceutical companies who have expressed interest in these two product opportunities.   

<P>

With respect to the class action lawsuit, on May 9 the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, granted Medco’s motion for summary judgment.  A notice of appeal was filed by the plaintiffs, and plaintiffs’ briefs are due by August 30. We continue to believe that the claims are without merit.

<P>

<B>Management </B>

<P>

Several significant changes took place during the quarter which resulted in strengthening the Company’s Board of Directors and internal management team.   Dr. Jay N. Cohn, Dr. Marvin S. Hausman and Mr. Mark B. Hirsch were appointed to serve as members of the Board.  Dr. Cohn is Professor of Medicine and Head, Cardiovascular Division, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, and holds a staff appointment at the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis.  He is an internationally respected physician and educator, as well as industry and government advisor and brings an important academic perspective to the Board. Dr. Hausman rejoins the Board after serving as a director of the Company from its inception through January, 1993. He currently serves as a consultant to the pharmaceutical industry and is President of Northwest Medical Research Partners, Inc.  Mr. Hirsch is currently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Red Cell, Inc.  He offers a knowledge base developed through 25 years of experience in strategic planning and corporate development in the pharmaceutical industry.  The addition of the skill and experiences of these individuals provides comprehensive and complementary support to the Company’s senior management team.

<P>

At the 1996 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on June 20, all  nominees for the Board of Directors were elected by the vote of 98 percent of the outstanding shares.  The Board of Directors is now comprised of Albert D. Angel, William M. Bartlett, Jay N. Cohn, M.D., Marvin S. Hausman, M.D., Mark B. Hirsch, Manfred Mosk, Ph.D., Eugene L. Step and Richard C. Williams.   Also at the meeting, the firm of KPMG Peat Marwick LLP was appointed to serve as the Company’s independent accountants. 

<P>

Glenn Andrews joined the Company as Chief Financial Officer on July 1.   Mr. Andrews has 20 years of  experience in financial management and was formerly Treasurer and Director of Business Analysis and Planning for Burroughs Wellcome Co.  His experience in the pharmaceutical industry and demonstrated achievements in the area of shareholder value based strategic planning will be critical elements in moving the Company forward.

<P>

<B>Summary</B>

<P>

The first six months of 1996 have been an exciting and fulfilling time at the Company.  Building on the encouraging results of the first quarter, our business continued to grow during the second quarter with royalty revenues increasing 19 percent quarter to quarter.  The diligent work of our R&D staff  culminated in the filing of two NDAs with the Food and Drug Administration.  

<P>

Looking forward, the Company’s broadened management team is committed to increasing shareholder value.  Specifically, we are targeting several strategies including:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Working with our partner to strengthen the current adenosine business
<LI>Working to identify and realize additional uses of adenosine
<LI>Working to acquire additional core and enabling technologies
<LI>Strengthening and seeking to expand corporate partnerships.
</UL>

<P>

Thank you for your interest in the success of Medco.  We look forward to your continued support in the days to come. 

<P>

Sincerely,

Dear Medford Savings Bank Shareholder:									
	
<P>
								
On October 10, 1996, Medford Savings Bank announced it attained the $1 billion asset mark at September 30, 1996.									

<P>
									
Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $7,737,000 an increase of $630,000, or 8.9% compared to net income of $7,107,000 for the same period in 1995.	
Per share consolidated earnings were $1.64 compared with $1.53 ($1.52 on a fully-diluted basis), an increase of 11 cents or 7.2% when comparing nine month results from the previous year.									

<P>
									
Consolidated net income for the third quarter in 1996 was $2,504,000 or 53 cents per share compared to $2,454,000 or 52 cents per share for the third quarter in 1995.									

<P>
									
We achieved record earnings for the first nine months of this year, an annualized return on assets of 1.06% and an annualized return on equity of 11.76%.  We are excited at having 									
exceeded $1 billion in total assets for the first time in our long history.  We continue to increase our earnings despite intensive competition and less than robust growth in the communities  									
of Middlesex County where we maintain a meaningful market position.  We continue to emphasize controlled growth in the residential mortgage loan market and quality, personalized									
services to our retail customers.  This is where we have a distinct advantage over our much larger competitors.  Our strategic initiative to upgrade our technology platform to best									
meet our customer requirements is well under way and is scheduled for completion during the fourth quarter of this year.  Despite this investment in technology, we continue 									
to be a low cost provider of services.									
 		
<P>
							
The improvement in earnings, when comparing the third quarter of 1996 to the third quarter of 1995, was the result of an increase of $376,000 in net interest income due to a  larger									
earning asset base of investments and loans.  In addition, the provision for the loan loss was $45,000 for the third quarter in 1996 compared to $200,000 for the third quarter in 1995 as we									
continue to experience solid credit quality in an improving economy.									
 
<P>
									
Included in other income are net gains on the sale of securities amounting to $85,000 for the three months ended September 30, 1996 compared to $135,000 for the same prior year									
quarter.  Operating expenses were $4,588,000 for the quarter compared to $4,218,000 in 1995.  Included in operating expenses for the third quarter in 1995 was a $497,000 refund									
in FDIC premiums. 									
 
<P>
									
The favorable earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 when compared to that same period last year was the result of $194,000 in improved net  interest income									
due to higher average earning assets, a reduction in the provision for loan losses of $447,000, net gains on the sale of securities amounting to $280,000 compared with $129,000;									
and reductions in operating costs of $571,000 .  Results for the nine months ended September 30, 1995 reflect $326,000 in net gains and recoveries on the sale of real estate owned,									
compared to net losses of $110,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1996.  Partially offsetting the improvement in operating expenses was reduced non-interest income									
as service fees from transaction accounts and loan origination fees were below prior year.									

<P>
									
Non-performing assets were $5,312,000 or 0.53% of total assets at September 30, 1996.  This compares to $5,373,000 and a ratio of 0.57% at September 30, 1995.  At September 30, 1996, 									
the allowance for loan losses was $7,399,000, compared to $7,286,000 at September 30, 1995.  The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 1996  represents approximately 139% 									
coverage of non-accrual loans.									

<P>
									
Medford Savings Bank had total assets of $1,008,200,000 and total deposits of $789,694,000 at September 30, 1996.  Stockholders' equity increased 7.7% from one year ago									
representing a book value of $19.97 per share.  The Bank's capital to assets ratio at September 30, 1996  was 8.98%, exceeding all regulatory requirements.									

<P>
									
We thank you for your confidence.

<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>Third Quarter Report - 1996</B></I>
<P>

   
To Our Shareholders:
<P>

		Revenues for the third quarter ended September 30 were $6,010,000, a gain of 7.1 percent over revenues of $5,611,000 in the third quarter of 1995. We reported a net profit of $73,000, or three cents per share, in the 1996 period versus a net loss of $215,000, or nine cents per share, in the prior year.
<P>

	For the first nine months of 1996, we reported sales of $16,413,000, a gain of 2.7 percent over revenues of $15,983,000 for the first nine months of 1995. The net loss for 1996 year-to-date was $1,721,000 or 68 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $1,567,000 or 64 cents per share, in the same period of 1995.
<P>

	Results for the third quarter and nine months of 1996 include non-operating income of $1,317,000 which is the payment received from SensorMedics Corporation as a result of the acquisition of SensorMedics by ThermoElectron Corporation.
	
<P>
As we stated earlier this year, our first priority in our strategic turnaround plan is to grow the revenue line, so we are pleased with our results in the third quarter. In particular, we are encouraged by an 11 percent increase in units sold year-to-date compared to the prior year. This strong unit growth reflects our aggressive market share strategies, the success of our strengthened sales force, and our competitive pricing policy.
<P>

	At the same time, we have increased research and development spending aimed to both maintain our position as the technological leader in our market and to decrease the size and cost of our existing products to broaden their appeal. This is a main contributor to the 20 percent increase in operating expenses for comparable quarters.				

<P>

Gross margin decreased from 46.5 percent in the third quarter of 1995 to 37.4 percent this year, mostly caused by our competitive pricing strategies, a $200,000 increase in warranty reserve for a more competitive warranty program, and a shift in product mix to lower margin products for the quarter.
<P>

	Looking forward, we have identified six markets where we will either introduce additional products into our existing distribution channel or leverage our current technology by finding applications in new markets. 
	
<P>
Our first major achievement in this direction was a letter of intent with TeleDiagnostic Systems, Inc., to pursue a distribution agreement for their sleep disorder diagnostic system. Their technology is a logical extension of our leadership in cardiorespiratory diagnostics. Since the two markets largely share the same customers, this agreement will maximize our selling potential.
	
<P>
This is just the beginning of our strategy to leverage our core strengths, and we remain encouraged in our abilities to achieve sustainable, profitable growth.
<P>

Sincerely,<P>

Dear Shareholder:
<P>

We are pleased to present to you our second quarter earnings, our first full quarter since the merger on February 23, 1996.  Overall, we are very pleased with the reception our operating results have received from the market since the merger.
<P>

For the three months ended June 30, 1996, Meridian Industrial Trust generated funds from operations (FFO) of $4,769,000 or $0.40 per share.  Total rental revenue for the quarter was $9,904,000 while operating expenses were $2,491,000.  Net income for the quarter was $3,413,000 or $0.29 per share. As of June 30, 1996, Meridian’s total portfolio of 87 properties comprising 9.4 million square feet was 93% leased and for the quarter ended June 30, 1996, 89% of the leases expiring had been renewed.  
<P>

Since the merger, Meridian has acquired two properties and has begun development of two properties.  Our investment in these four properties will total $44 million and add to the portfolio industrial warehouse/distribution space representing over 1.2 million square feet.  Meridian’s two acquisitions since the merger are a $9.7 million investment in a 333,000 sq. ft. warehouse/distribution building in the City of Industry, CA which is leased to Continental General Tire for five years and an $8.5 million investment in a recently completed 160,000 sq. ft. warehouse/distribution building in Newark, CA leased to B.T. Office Products International for ten years. 
Our two build-to-suit projects are currently under construction in Texas.  Estimated to be completed in January 1997, Meridian is constructing a $10.3 million, 368,000 sq. ft. modern warehouse/distribution building leased for 15 years to an existing tenant, L.D. Brinkman.  A $15.3 million, 362,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art warehouse/distribution building is also under construction for Allegience Corporation, a former subsidiary of Baxter International.  The lease term is 15 years and estimated completion is December 1996.  We are pleased with our investments to date and we look forward to continuing this pace throughout the second half of 1996.
<P>

A second quarter dividend of $0.31 per Series B preferred share was paid on July 15, 1996 to shareholders of record on June 28, 1996.  A second quarter dividend of $0.29 per common share was paid on July 19, 1996 to all shareholders of record on July 3, 1996.
<P>
  
With the merger well behind us, we are now able to focus on growing Meridian and enhancing shareholder value. We appreciate the support you, our shareholders, have given to us and we look forward to the challenge of building Meridian into the preeminent national industrial property company.</BLOCKQUOTE>

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

	This is my first opportunity to communicate to you as president and chief executive officer of MGI PHARMA.  I am delighted to be part of a company with advanced development capabilities, an excellent product on the market and strong growth potential.  I believe my prior experiences as an executive in the pharmaceutical industry will compliment MGI’s continued strategy of building shareholder value through in-licensing and strategic alliancing.  I look forward to carrying MGI PHARMA’s plans to fruition.

<B>MGI PHARMA FIRST QUARTER REPORT</B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	MGI PHARMA’s financial results for the 1996 first quarter reflect a 42 percent increase in product sales over the comparable quarter of last year due to growth in demand for SalagenÒ Tablets.  First quarter expenses compare favorably to the same period last year.

<P>
	Sales revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 1996, totaled $1,328,788, compared to $937,140 for the 1995 first quarter.  Total revenues for the 1996 first quarter were $2,116,588, compared to $2,510,628.  We reduced our reported loss for the 1996 first quarter to $803,507, or 6 cents per share, 37 percent less than the loss of  $1,267,169, or 11 cents per share, reported for the prior-year period.  At the end of the first quarter, we had a cash position of $16.5 million. 

<P>
	Licensing revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 1996, included an ongoing quarterly milestone payment of $360,000 from Dainippon Pharmaceuticals, our Japanese licensee for the Acylfulvene family of anti-cancer compounds.  The decrease in total revenues was expected since licensing revenues for the 1995 first quarter included a one-time $1 million milestone payment from Chiron Therapeutics, our European licensing partner for Salagen Tablets.  Without this payment, we would show a pro forma 63 percent increase in licensing revenues and a 40 percent increase in total revenues for the first quarter.

<P>
	R&D expenses declined by 25 percent, which represents a typical fluctuation in clinical development expenses and not a reduction in R&D activities.  In the 1995 fourth quarter, we incurred expenses related to full patient enrollment in our Sjögren’s syndrome Phase III clinical trials.  The next major expense for these trials is data compilation and analysis, which will be incurred in the second and third quarters of this year.  Our human Phase I clinical trial for our leading Acylfulvene analog continues as planned.        

<P>
	In 1994, we launched Salagen Tablets as a treatment for xerostomia (dry mouth) following head and neck radiation therapy.  Salagen Tablets are now on the market in the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland, approved in France and Greece and under regulatory review in Canada, Israel, Italy, Denmark and The Netherlands.  New regulatory filings are planned in 1996 for Taiwan, Germany and several other European nations.   

<P>
	About  five months ago, we began an extensive market research study which lead to the development of a revised marketing plan and the completion of a human resource deployment study.
Salagen is a highly effective pharmaceutical, but most post-radiation cancer patients require treatment for 90 or more days to feel our drug is working.  Compliance becomes a major issue when a product needs to be taken for this length of time.  Our market research uncovered confusion among healthcare providers regarding the proper dosage.  To address this situation, we developed and introduced a Xerostomia Management Program to help healthcare providers help their patients understand and comply with their Salagen treatment plan.  The program includes patient education materials, a patient newsletter and a toll-free information line, where patients and providers can call registered pharmacists with their questions about Salagen and xerostomia.

<P>
	Our new marketing plan incorporates a major change in our strategy which now focuses on establishing the benefits of using Salagen Tablets early in radiation therapy, rather than waiting until the completion of a course of treatment.  Many physicians indicate that patients’ xerostomia is not as severe when patients take Salagen early.  It also appears, but has not been proven, that early Salagen use minimizes the interruption of therapy due to pain.  Medical studies supporting both concepts will be published in 1996.  

<P>
	Finally, the human resource deployment study lead to restructuring and upgrading of our field organization and the addition of three new sales territories.  We now have three experienced district managers, two who are new in these positions, and 22 sales representatives.  Because of this transition, several territories were open in late 1995 and the first quarter of 1996.  All positions are now filled.  Our newly hired sales representatives average eight years of pharmaceutical selling experience and most have oncology experience.

<P>
	We are confident that we can achieve our stated goal to establish Salagen Tablets as the first-line preferred treatment for xerostomia, and that translates into continuing revenue growth.

<B>MICRONICS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B>

<P>
	FREMONT, Calif., July 29, 1996 -- Micronics Computers, Inc. (Nasdaq: MCRN) today announced results for the third quarter ended June 30, 1996.  Net sales for the quarter totaled $29.8 million, down 44.7 percent from net sales of $53.8 million for the quarter ended June 30,  1995.  The net loss for this year’s third quarter was $1.9 million or $0.14 per share, compared to a net loss of $15.2 million or $1.11 per share for the same period last year.

<P>
	For the nine months ended June 30, 1996, the Company reported net sales of $130.6 million, a decrease of 21.4 percent from net sales of $166.2 million in 1995, and a net loss of $1.9 million or $0.14 per share compared with a net loss of $13.7 million or $1.02 per share in the prior year period.

<P>
	The Company has continued to strengthen its balance sheet.  At quarter end, cash and short-term investments were $24.5 million, up 20.6 percent from the $20.3 million at the end of the previous quarter and up from $8.8 million at this same time last year.  Inventories were $11.5 million, up slightly from the $10.1 million on March 31, 1996, and substantially lower than $36.9 million a year ago.  During the third quarter, as in the previous quarters this fiscal year, the Company has not borrowed under its line of credit.  "Our balance sheet strength has enabled us to manage our way through the third quarter sales slowdown.  It will also allow us to internally finance the inventory purchases necessary to meet the customer demand we see in the fourth quarter," said Shanker Munshani, chief executive officer and president of Micronics.

<P>
	June 1996 Quarter Business Review	Revenues of $29.8 million for the third quarter ended June 30, 1996, followed revenues of $40.7 million for the previous quarter.  "Third quarter net sales were in the range announced in the second quarter earnings release. This decrease was due to lower orders from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), only partially offset by significantly higher sales to the U.S. government, " said Munshani.  Munshani pointed out that product transition from the Orion- and Triton 1-based motherboard to the Natoma and Triton II-based products respectively,  resulted in lower sales to the Company’s OEM customer base. That transition has now been completed.  He added that "We’re  very pleased with the rebound in the government channel sales after we experienced the slowdown in previous quarters brought about by the government shutdown earlier in the year."  Pentium- and Pentium/Pro-based products accounted for more than 93 percent of shipments in the third quarter, up from 87.8 percent in the second quarter.  

<P>
	Gross margin for the third quarter was 12.4 percent, compared with (7.6) percent for the same period last year and 9.9 percent for the second quarter of this year. The improved gross margin was primarily due to the recording of lower inventory reserves in the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the second quarter and the third quarter in the previous year. "Improvements in materials management and end of life planning have allowed us to maintain gross margin during this period of intense price pressure and lower sales volume," stated Munshani.

<P>
	Operating expenses for the quarter were $5.9 million, down from $19.1 million in the third quarter of the prior year and from $5.3 million in the second quarter of FY 1996. This increase from the second quarter is primarily the result of $450,000 in charges incurred from closing down a subsidiary in France.  Research and development costs were flat as compared to the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of fiscal 1995. General and administrative expenses were slightly below the second quarter of  this year and significantly lower than in the third quarter of fiscal 1995 (which included an $11.9 million accounts receivable write off for Osborne Computers.)

<P>
	For the third quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company chose to take a conservative accounting approach and not book a tax benefit resulting from the operating loss.

<P>
	Micronics plans to introduce high-end 3D and multiple Pentium Pro products for several market segments. This is an important step in establishing technical leadership. Pentium and Pentium Pro products are penetrating the workstation and server markets and Micronics is seeking to develop products to take advantage of those opportunities. In the peripherals arena, several leading-edge products are slated for introduction this year. One of these, a leading-edge 3D product, Orchid Righteous 3D, will be introduced to the market in anticipation for the 1996 Christmas selling season.  

<P>
	The Company still expects a strong rebound in revenues in its fourth fiscal quarter, with revenues in the $45-$50 million range. We anticipate improvement in shipments to the OEM channel as we believe they have worked their way through their product transitions.  For the fourth quarter, government sales are expected to show continued improvement.  The Company expects revenue from all other sales channels to improve as compared to the third quarter.

<P>
	The Company expects the fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be lower as compared to the third quarter due to continued pricing pressure.  Operating expenses in dollars are expected to be comparable to the third quarter spending level to allow for sales and marketing costs associated with the Orchid Righteous 3D product launch.

<P>
	The above statements contained in this outlook are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  In addition to the factors discussed above, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following:  the Company’s ability to retain existing and win new OEM business; business conditions and growth in the personal computer industry and general economy; change in customer order patterns including timing of delivery; competitive factors, such as acceptance of new products and price pressures; availability of third-party component products at reasonable prices; risk of nonpayment of accounts receivable; risk of inventory obsolescence due to shifts in market demand; meeting product introduction schedules; changes in the mix of system boards and Nucleus products; litigation involving intellectual property and consumer issues; and other factors listed from time-to-time in the Company’s SEC reports, including, but not limited to, the discussion in the MD&A (Management’s Discussion & Analysis) included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1995.

<P>
	Micronics Computers, Inc. is a leading independent supplier of high performance system boards and multimedia peripherals for personal computers.  The Company’s products are widely recognized for their outstanding quality and reliability.  Based in Fremont, California, Micronics markets its products worldwide to computer system manufacturers, system integrators, value-added resellers, and the distribution channel.  The Company’s toll-free sales number is (800) 577-0977.

<CENTER><B> MIDWAY GAMES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

CHICAGO, IL  -- November 6, 1996 --  Midway Games Inc. (NYSE: MWY) announced today its results of operations for  the first quarter ended September 30, 1996.

<P>

	Fiscal 1997 first quarter revenues were $65,555,000 compared with $67,938,000 in the prior year period.  Net income was $6,077,000, $0.18 per share, compared with net income of $7,170,000, $0.21 per share, in the prior year period.

<P>

	Home video game revenues increased to $47,554,000 in the fiscal 1997 first quarter from $46,717,000 in the prior year.  Coin operated video game revenues decreased to $18,001,000 in the first quarter from $21,221,000 in the prior year.

<P>

	The fiscal 1997 first quarter reflects product development expenses of $12,003,000 compared with $5,851,000 in the prior year.  This planned increase is primarily due to the addition of the product development expenses from the Company’s newly acquired subsidiary Atari Games Corporation.  The higher level of product development expenses is expected to result in increased coin-operated and home video game introductions for the 1997 fiscal year and subsequent periods.

<P>

	The Company’s newest coin-operated video game, Cruis’n World, was introduced at the annual AMOA trade show in September where it won the award for "Best New Game at the Show."  Midway will begin customer shipments of this game in November.

<P>

	In October the Company launched its newest home video game Mortal Kombat Trilogy on the Sony Playstation which the Company believes resulted in one of the most successful product launches in the history of that platform.  The Nintendo 64 and personal computer versions will be launched in November.

<P>

	In the second quarter ending December 31, 1996, Midway expects to launch The NHLPA & NHL Present Wayne Gretzky’s 3D Hockey for the Nintendo 64;  Robotron X for the Sony Playstation and personal computers; Area 51 for Sony Playstation, Sega Saturn and personal computers; Open Ice for Sony Playstation and personal computers; and NBA Hangtime for Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Sony Playstation and personal computers.

<P>

	On October 30, 1996 the Company successfully completed the initial public offering of 5,100,000 of its common shares at a price of $20.00 per share. The managing underwriters of the offering were Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., Hambrecht & Quist LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Wassertein Perella Securities, Inc.

<P>

	This press release contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the introduction of video games.  The actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including delays in product development and manufacturing and the introduction of new dedicated platforms.

<P>

	Midway Games is a leading designer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment software for both the coin-operated and home markets.  Midway’s games are available for play on all major dedicated home video game platforms, including Nintendo, Sony and Sega and personal computers.

<B>Third Quarter 1996 Results</B>

<P>

Dear Shareholder:

<P>

Mikohn has recorded significant sales increases in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 1996, compared with the corresponding periods of last year.  We generated a small profit in the third quarter, representing a substantial improvement from 1995's comparable period, which was impacted by our restructuring and consolidation program.

<P>

<U><B>Financial Review.</B> </U>  Sales for the three months ended September 30, 1996 totaled $21.7 million, up 43.7% from $15.1 million one year ago.  Net income for the quarter was $16,138, equal to a fraction of a cent per share, compared with a net loss of $6.6 million, or 68 cents per share, in the prior year.

<P>

As can be expected during the conceptual and introductory phases of most new high tech products, investment in research and development continues to be significant, although in line with that of the second quarter.

<P>

Nine months sales rose 17.7% to a record $65.7 million from $55.8  million in the comparable period of 1995. 

<P>

<U><B>Backlog Highest in History.</B></U>   Orders from our core businesses - interior casino signs and progressive meters - remain strong.  Backlog at September 30, 1996 totaled $24.1 million, up from $13.2 million a year earlier and $21.2 million at June 30, the end of the second quarter.

<P>

<U><B>MikohnVision at Times Square.</B></U>  A major recent highlight was the installation of a MikohnVision™ system for ITT Corporation in New York's Times Square, one of the world's most famous and most photographed landmarks.  This high profile video spectacular was the subject of an article in Newsweek.  It will give our new system tremendous exposure and underscores its applicability for non-gaming venues such as stadiums and arenas.

<P>

We now have more than 20 MikohnVision™ spectaculars installed in five states and four foreign countries.  We are currently building an exterior, double sided version as part of a major renovation project at the Sahara Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

<P>
<U>
<B>Interior Signage and Progressive Metered Displays.</B></U>  We have just received a $2 million order from Crown Casino in Melbourne, which will be Australia's largest casino when it opens in early 1997.  We also completed installation of a multi-site, progressive jackpot system in five Las Vegas locations operated by Becker Gaming, Inc.

<P>

<U><B>Field Testing of New SafeJack System.</B></U>  Our new blackjack system is being field tested at Bally's Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.  We are pleased by the system's performance under live casino conditions, as well as the positive feedback we are receiving from both players and Bally's.

<P>

With  restructuring and consolidation behind us, and with our new products and systems approaching commercial sales, we are continuing to position ourselves for 1997 and beyond.

<CENTER><B>SALES AND EARNINGS FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 1996</B></CENTER>

	
<P>
Elkhart, Indiana - October 22, 1996 -- The Morgan Group, Inc. (AMEX:MG) announced today that revenues rose 6% to an all time record in the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, but net income and earnings per share fell behind last year's levels.
	
<P>
Earnings per share were 18¢ in the third quarter compared to 29¢ in the third quarter of last year.  EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $1,141,000 versus $1,449,000 in the year-ago quarter.  Net income after taxes was $495,000 compared to $814,000 last year.
	
<P>
Revenues in the quarter increased to $35,305,000 versus $33,251,000 in the third quarter last year with strength continuing in the company's services to the manufactured housing industry.  Morgan's success in manufactured housing is being offset by declines in revenue in both quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date comparisons in specialized delivery services.  This latter segment is especially dependent on various recreational vehicle products, such as van conversions, travel trailers and tent campers, where both pricing and volume have been below our targets.  Notwithstanding, both EBITDA and operating margins improved modestly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter this year.  
	
<P>
In manufactured housing during this quarter, Morgan added a new plant with an existing large customer and expanded volumes at two other locations.  This segment is on track in terms of revenue growth and is beginning to reflect some improvement in operating margins.  Driver outsourcing is now providing services to United Parcel Service and is adding additional commercial customers in the fourth quarter, as the company's efforts to moderate this group's heavy concentration on consumer rental truck repositioning and motor homes are showing success.  Claims costs and the cost of expanding system capabilities are both impacting operating margins.  Specialized delivery services has been disappointing this year.  In previous years this group has been a strong contributor, but the volume from customers is flat or down and the pricing continues to be soft.  This segment is receiving a great deal of management's attention to develop a less volatile customer base.
	
<P>
The Morgan Group is the nation's leader in providing outsourcing transportation services to the manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries, and also arranges for the movement of commercial vehicles, office trailers, automobiles, buses, and a variety of other vehicles and freight.  The company has a national network of approximately 1,525 full-time independent owner operators and 1,555 other drivers assigned to its driver outsourcing division, dispatched from 103 offices in 36 states.  Through the Interstate Indemnity Company and Morgan Finance subsidiaries, the company provides insurance and financial services to its owner operators.
<P>

	Morgan's balance sheet remains strong with cash and cash equivalents in excess of $3.1 million, shareholders' equity of $16.2 million, and available credit facilities of $12 million.  Given the company's balance sheet strength and available credit facilities, the company believes it is financially equipped to pursue acquisition opportunities.  The company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase (in the aggregate) of 150,000 shares of the company's Class A Common Stock; since the repurchase program began in March, 1995, the company has now repurchased over 116,000 shares.

                 <CENTER><B>MORGAN PRODUCTS REPORTS<BR>
                    EARNINGS & SALES GAINS<BR>
      FOR 3RD QUARTER AND 9-MONTH PERIODS</B></CENTER>
<P>


	<B>WILLIAMSBURG, VA,</B> October 25, 1996 -- Morgan
Products Ltd. (NYSE - MGN) reported a gain in earnings
and sales for both its third quarter and nine-month fiscal periods.

<P>

	For the three months ended September 28, 1996, Morgan Products reported earnings of $2,891,000 or 33 cents per share before a special charge for restructuring, compared to net income of $111,000 or 1 cent per share in the comparable year-ago period.

<P>

	Including a charge of $1,956,000 for restructuring related to consolidation at the Company's Morgan Manufacturing unit, net income for the fiscal third quarter was $935,000 or 11 cents per share.

<P>

	Sales for the 1996 fiscal third quarter were up 7.3 percent to $97,377,000 compared to $90,723,000 in the comparable 1995 period.

<P>

	Morgan Products indicated that the special charge was a result of expenses associated with consolidating its Lexington door manufacturing operations into its newly-renovated Oshkosh, Wisconsin facility.

<P>

	Commenting on the Company's results, Larry Robinette, president and chief executive officer, said, "We continue to have much improved profitability at Morgan Distribution reflecting both our new sales initiatives and our ongoing expense reductions.

<P>

	"The level of expense at Morgan Manufacturing is higher than we originally planned," Robinette said.  "This increase in labor, materials handling, and shipping and logistical costs reflects both the unexpectedly high inefficiencies of ramping up production levels coupled with the costs of the extraordinary efforts we are making to service stronger than anticipated customer demand.

<P>

	"In the last few weeks," Robinette noted, "we have made substantial progress in raising production levels and reducing backorders.  This progress increases my confidence that, as previously announced, we will realize the $3 million in savings in 1997 from the consolidation and introduction of our new high-speed door assembly line."

<P>

For the first nine months of the Company's 1996 fiscal year, Morgan Products reported net income of $3,775,000 or 43 cents per share before a special charge for restructuring, compared to a loss of $1,120,000 or 13 cents per share in the comparable year-ago period.

<P>

	Including a charge of $2,837,000 for restructuring related to consolidation at the Company's Morgan Manufacturing unit, net income for the first nine months of the fiscal year was $938,000 or 11 cents per share.

<P>

	Sales for the first nine months of the 1996 fiscal year climbed to $267,121,000 compared to $255,649,000 in the year-ago period.

<P>

	Morgan Products Ltd. is a leading manufacturer and distributor of specialty building products through its three business units:  Morgan Distribution, Morgan Manufacturing and Morgan National Accounts.

<P>

	Morgan Distribution, a regional wholesale distributor, is comprised of 14 distribution/fabrication centers.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To MOSCOM's Stockholders:<P>

	MOSCOM’s revenues for the third quarter which ended September 30, 1996, continued the growth experienced in the second quarter.  Sales of $4,055,118 were 21% greater than the second quarter of this year and 6% greater than the third quarter last year.  Revenues were a record for any third quarter, historically MOSCOM’s weakest.  Sales gains during the quarter came primarily from the INFO/MDR product line and from sales of call accounting systems to Lucent Technologies
<P>

	Despite the growth in revenues, MOSCOM had an operating loss of $1,556,654.  This loss resulted primarily from sizable increases in operating expenses at Votan, including some non-recurring expenses for recruitment of management, sales and marketing staff.  This was part of MOSCOM’s plan to expand Votan from an R&D center to a profitable independent entity in an emerging growth industry.  MOSCOM also invested heavily in on-site support for the first Verabill installation and the completion of additional Verabill modules.  Compared to previous quarters, a much greater percentage of these software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized.
<P>

	In addition, MOSCOM took a one time charge in the third quarter of $724,825 to cover expenses related to the planned initial public offering of Votan stock, which could not be completed as proposed and was accordingly withdrawn.
<P>

	Lastly, we took a one-time charge of $835,582 for the write-off of certain licensed and capitalized software.  These charges relate primarily to older software products that have been replaced by newer products.  Among them, INFO Bill has been replaced by Verabill which is far better suited for the billing markets being targeted by MOSCOM.  By taking this charge, MOSCOM’s capitalized software as it appears on the balance sheet will more closely relate to projected revenues and reduce the burden of future amortization expenses.
	Third quarter sales of INFO/MDR were strong.  Even more significant was the progress we made with three RBOCs.  Although the process of selling INFO/MDR to the RBOCs has been excruciatingly slow, we are now optimistic that our efforts will be rewarded in the near term.  We believe we are well positioned with each of these three RBOCs.  Needless to say, the selection of INFO/MDR as a standard by any one of the RBOCs would be a significant milestone for MOSCOM.
<P>

	The market’s reaction to Verabill has been very encouraging.  MOSCOM has been approached by three additional leading switch vendors regarding cooperative marketing arrangements for Verabill. Those three new potential partnerships will supplement our existing relationships on Verabill with Alcatel, Lucent and ORGA.  Together they could give Verabill a dominant distribution position in the worldwide billing market for cellular, wire based and multimedia systems with up to 400,000 subscribers.  In addition, we have very recently begun to market Verabill to telephone service resellers in the US.  With deregulation of the US market gaining speed, this is another very large potential market for Verabill.
<P>

	Votan’s new sales force has been very successful in qualifying prospects for using voice verification technology.  They will be focusing on 20 major accounts that could produce significant revenue in 1997.  Included on that list are several domestic and foreign banks, including Chase Manhattan, cellular telephone operators, state government agencies and OEM accounts.  We are encouraged by the potential business for Votan but are not planning on any material revenues from these accounts until 1997.
	
<P>
We project that MOSCOM’s cash balance will be more than adequate to meet our projected requirements for the balance of this year and beyond.  Those projections do not, however, include the full expansion of Votan’s marketing, sales and support staffs as planned for Votan as an independent public company.  We will re-evaluate the alternatives for fully funding Votan’s business plan periodically as Votan progresses.
<P>

	Looking forward to the fourth quarter, MOSCOM will have significantly reduced operating expenses.  Provided certain Verabill and INFO/ MDR orders are received when anticipated, MOSCOM will also experience continued growth in sales and a return to profitable operations.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Trends that have been restraining growth in the trucking industry for the past year continued to have adverse effects on earnings and revenue during the first quarter of 1996.
<P>

In addition to over-capacity of equipment, continued soft market conditions and bad weather throughout the service area, the industry experienced substantially higher fuel costs in the first three months of 1996.
<P>

The combination of these factors led to a 2.5 percent decrease in operating revenues for the first quarter, down to $79.7 million from $81.7 million in the same period 1995.  Operating income for the first quarter 1996 was $3.9 million, a decrease of 42 percent from $6.7 million in the same period 1995.
Net income for the quarter ending March 31,1996 was $1.7 million, a 55 percent decrease from $3.8 million in the first quarter of 1995.  Earnings per share for the quarter of 1996 were 14 cents per share, a decrease of 52 percent from 29 cents per share for the same quarter last year.
<P>

Five business units contributed to the $79.7 million revenue total including $40 million in domestic line haul services, $7.7 million in international-Mexico services, $6.3 million in dedicated services, $21.4 million in regional services, and $4.3 million in logistics services.
<P>

The disparity between the respective first quarter earnings of 1996 and 1995 was further magnified by the fact that M.S. Carriers experienced unusually dynamic business volumes during 1994 and the first three months of 1995.
Despite the lower earnings, the company is optimistic due to improved market conditions in March, along with emerging savings from process improvements and cost control measures put in place over the past year.  If the business climate continues to improve, M.S. Carriers will be in a good position to increase profits the rest of the year.
<P>

The company appreciates the continued patience of its stockholders.  Despite these cyclical changes, one factor is constant: M.S. Carriers will remain a leader in the trucking industry.<P>

To Our Shareowners:</b></i>
<p>
Mycogen’s future is coming into sharper focus as we place cornerstones for the major agribusiness company we’ve set our sights on building.  On December 13, we signed a definitive agreement to collaborate with Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the world’s largest seed company, to develop Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insect-resistance technology for a broad range of crops.  This agreement gives Mycogen access to Pioneer’s unmatched plant science research and development infrastructure and $51 million cash to continue building our seed and crop protection businesses.  
<p>
<i><b>Financial</b></i> - As we stated in our 1995 annual report, we believe 1996 is the year that will begin to demonstrate the full commercial value of the technology we’ve been assembling for the past decade.  In reviewing Mycogen’s financial performance for this first fiscal quarter, please bear in mind that our businesses are highly seasonal.  First quarter expenses reflect stepped-up sales and promotional programs for the coming growing season, but seed sales aren’t recorded until the second and third fiscal quarters, and crop protection revenues fall mainly in the third and fourth quarters.  That’s why our loss for the quarter was about the same as last year’s, despite a 23 percent year-to-year increase in revenues.  
<p>
<i><b>Crop Protection</b></i> - Continuing heavy demand for crop protection services in California and Arizona and strong biopesticide sales produced above-plan revenues for the quarter.  Our new Mattch™ bioinsecticide for caterpillar control in vegetables is off to a fast start in winter growing areas in Florida and Texas, and our new Scythe™ herbicide is rapidly gaining acceptance in landscape markets.  International sales also continue to grow as a result of Kubota’s successful introduction of Guardjet® bioinsecticide in Japan, and our entry into new markets where Mycogen’s products have been approved.
<p>
<i><b>Seeds</b></i> - With larger quantities of our NatureGard™ insect-resistant, and Totally Managed Feedstuffs™ silage seed corn products now available, our focus is on building sales through our existing farmer/dealer network and broadening distribution through new channels.  As we reported in September, Cargill Hybrid Seeds will sell NatureGard seed corn with Bt-based resistance to European corn borer under the Mycogen brand for planting this spring.   At the same time, we continue to explore added 1996 distribution through agricultural products distributors and retailers.
<p>
<i><b>Outlook</b></i> - With biotechnology moving rapidly into the agricultural mainstream, the coming months and years will be a period of unprecedented opportunity for Mycogen.  We continue to explore every avenue to strengthen and broaden our business to ensure that those opportunities are translated into shareowner value.  We appreciate your support.

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

I am pleased to report that the improvement in the operations of NAI Technologies, Inc. that occurred during the second quarter of 1996 has continued into the third quarter of 1996.  All of the company's divisions were profitable in the third quarter of 1996 and the third quarter net income improved by over 18% when compared to the 1996 second quarter results.

<P>

For the quarter ended September 28, 1996 NAI had net sales of $17.3 million compared with $15.9 million for the period ended September 30, 1995.  Net income for the quarter ended September 28, 1996 was $964,000 or $0.11 per share compared with a loss of $2,296,000 or $0.31 per share in the same period last year.  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) for the quarter ended September 28, 1996 was $2,252,000 compared with an EBITDA loss of $974,000 in the prior year period. The $0.11 per share net income in the 1996 third quarter compares favorably with the $0.10 per share net income in the 1996 second quarter, especially considering the fact that there were an additional 500,000 average shares outstanding during the 1996 third quarter.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 28, 1996 the company reported sales of $51.1 million, a 20% increase over the same period last year.  Net earnings were $1,329,000 or $0.16 per share compared to a loss of $9,195,000 or $1.25 per share for the first nine months of last year.

<P>

Operating earnings for the third quarter and nine months of 1996  were $1,750,000 and $3,539,000, respectively, compared to an operating loss of $1,487,000 and $7,313,000, respectively for the same periods in the prior year.  The 1996 third quarter and nine months operating results were favorably impacted by the recognition of gains of approximately $750,000 and $1,500,000, respectively, on the previously announced sale of the Systems Integration Division of Codar Technologies.

<P>
<DL>
<DD>The third quarter saw continued improvement on many fronts throughout the company.  Some of the more notable achievements are as follows:<P>

Continuing staffing adjustments and increased sales have improved the company's productivity to a current revenue rate of over $300,000 per employee.
<P>

All divisions of the company were profitable both for the third quarter and on a year to date basis.
The third quarter of 1996 saw an operating profit improvement of almost 14% and a net earnings increase in excess of 18% when compared with the second quarter of 1996.
<P>

The company completed the sale of its Systems Integration Division of Codar Technologies to Tracor, Inc. and has recorded  a net gain of $1,500,000 on the transaction for the nine months of 1996.
<P>

Bank debt was reduced, ahead of schedule, by approximately $4,200,000 over the last six months and the company had in excess of $3,000,000 in cash on hand at the end of the third quarter of 1996.
<P>

Approximately $3,000,000 of the company's $8,342,000 of  12% convertible subordinated debt has been converted to equity which strengthens the balance sheet of the company.
<P>

The company received a favorable verdict in the TDA class action lawsuit resulting in no liability to the company or any of its officers or directors.
</DL>
<P>

During the remainder of 1996 and beyond, the company will continue its efforts to reduce costs and increase sales in order to improve profitability and enhance the value of the company to its shareholders.

<P>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and lenders for the support they have shown the company, for without them  the company would not be where it is today, poised to resume its growth.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>  I am very pleased to report that the third quarter of fiscal year 1996 was yet another solid quarter for NCS.  Revenues from continuing operations grew 11%, our best quarterly performance of the year.  Net income increased 31% and earnings per share grew by 33%, thanks to a strong operating performance and, to some extent, the interest earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of Financial Systems last quarter. 

<P>

Excellent revenue growth was reported by our Assessments and Testing business which grew 22% in the quarter compared with the year earlier quarter.  Although a portion of the growth in the third quarter was due to favorable timing, this business has performed very well all year.  The Education Software and Services (ESS) business reported 43% revenue growth in the third quarter, a continuation of the strong growth it has been reporting all year.  Our international operations reported 47% revenue growth in the quarter.  This fine performance was fueled by continued solid results in our Canadian operations, the beginning of the revenue flow from our Mexican Equal Access contract, the successful integration of the Delstar acquisition in Canada, and the joint venture we established in Australia.  Although the revenue growth in both ESS and International was from a small base in the year-ago third quarter, each represents excellent progress and points to further improvements in coming quarters.

<P>

Although our gross profit percentage fell slightly in the quarter, the decline was predominantly due to a higher portion of revenues coming from the test processing business which carries lower gross margins.  Operating expenses were well managed in the quarter as a decline in G&A expense offset the somewhat higher sales and marketing expenses.  We are carefully investing in additional sales resources to bring our new image-based data collection systems to the market.  The balance sheet remains exceptionally strong as does the Company’s cash flow.  We have the financial resources to grow internally or make acquisitions which will accelerate NCS’ growth going forward.  The process of identifying the right acquisitions continues and we remain cautiously optimistic on this front.

<P>

Among the many highlights of the third quarter, we announced a letter of intent to acquire Macro Educational Systems, Inc., a leading developer of administrative software for the K-12 education market.  We intend to develop an integrated suite of products combining the best features of our current offerings with those of Macro.  The transaction is expected to be closed during the fourth quarter.

<P>

Also during the quarter, NCS was awarded a multi-year contract by the Mexican government to manage the process of balloting for long-distance phone service across the country.  This is part of Mexico’s opening of their long-distance telephone market to competition and we expect the contract to have a positive affect on our results for the next several quarters.

<P>

The fourth quarter has begun well and we are on track with expectations.  We have begun work on our 1997 plan and, at this point, are looking for another year of revenue and earnings growth.  I am grateful for the support of our customers, the hard work of all our employees, and the confidence you, our shareholders, continue to show in NCS.

<b>NATIONAL ENERGY GROUP, INC. ANNOUNCES 3RD QUARTER RESULTS</b>
<p>
DALLAS, TEXAS, November 15, 1995 National Energy Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEGX) today reported results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1995. Cash flow from operation before changes in working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 1995 was up 300% to $2,248,164 against $563,117 a year earlier or $.22 per share up from $.07 per share for the same period last year. 
<p>
Revenues for the third quarter were $2,207,435 up 162% from $843,612 in 1994. The Company reported an operating profit of $427,146 up 392% from $86,768 for the same quarter a year earlier. Net income for the quarter was $149,059 up 750% from $17,527 in the third quarter of 1994.
<p>
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 1995 were $4,861,176 up 114% from $2,272,896 in 1994. The operating profit for nine months was $820,237, up 238% against $242,729 a year earlier. The net income for the nine months was $54,136 against a loss of $151,102 in the first nine months of 1994. Net income for the nine months this year included an extraordinary charge of $437,762 for early extinguishment of debt and the loss for the nine months last year included an extraordinary charge of $121,917.
<p>
 National Energy Group's crude oil production for nine months of 1995 increased 110% to 176,591 barrels compared to 84,313 barrels in the comparable 1994 period. Natural gas production rose 142% to 1,065,037 Mcf of gas for the first six months of 1995 from 440,905 Mcf of gas for the same period of 1994. Production of oil and gas has reached the highest level in the history of the Company.
<p>
 The improvement in revenues and volumes can be attributed to the acquisitions of producing properties from Sierra Mineral Development, L.C. and Enron Oil and Gas Company and the successful drilling of 14 new wells at the Goldsmith Adobe Unit (GAU) in Ector County, Texas. A continuing concerted effort to enhance, exploit, and to perform maintenance and recompletions on the entire existing asset base also improved results. 
<p>
Mr. Miles D. Bender, President and Chief Executive Officer, said he expected the Company's recent purchases of producing properties from Sierra Mineral Development, L.C. and Enron Oil and Gas Company and the accelerated development of the GAU to lead to a new phase of growth and maturity which will include acquisitions, increased exploration and a significant move offshore for National Energy Group.

<CENTER><B>Third Quarter Report November 15, 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

<B>To Our Partners:</B>

<P>

 	National HealthCare L.P. is continuing its 25th year with a 44% increase in income for the three months ended September 30. We believe a large portion of this increase can be credited to our focus on our motto: Care Is Our Business. This focus on the most important aspect of our business is also reflected in your cash distribution. The cash distribution is 52 cents per unit for unitholders of record on September 30 and payable on November 15.
<P>

	For the three months ended September 30, primary earnings per unit increased 32% to 94 cents per unit. Revenues increased 7% to $96,920,000. 
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, net income increased 36% to $19,542,000. Primary earnings per unit increased 25% to $2.28. Revenues increased 8% to $281,551,000.
 
<P>

	The improved earnings and growth in revenues in the first nine months compared to the same period last year is due to the expanded long-term care services, managed care services, management services and improvements in private pay and third party payor rates.
	
<P>


NHC's concentration on providing excellent care and offering a full range of health care services for 25 years results in a greater demand for our services. The results of this quarter show that our efforts continue to be successful. With health care reform and the interest in quality, cost effective health care, we believe more Americans will choose NHC. Our expansion is enhanced by opportunities in the managed care market.
<P>

	NHC currently operates 100 long-term health care centers with 12,870 beds. NHC also operates 32 homecare programs, four retirement centers and 11 assisted living locations. NHC also operates managed care specialty medical units, Alzheimer's units and a rehabilitation services company.  I want to thank you again for your investment in NHC and pledge to you that NHC is committed to constantly being the best in services and earnings.

<P>

Sincerely,<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Shareholders:

<P>

	I am pleased to report significantly improved results for the first nine months of this fiscal year. Earnings per share for the nine months ended June 30, 1996, increased 21 percent to $2.11 per share from the prior year results of $1.74 per share, excluding the non-recurring charges taken during 1995. During the current year, total shares outstanding increased as we successfully expanded our shareholder base through the sale of 1.8 million additional shares in May. This expansion of our equity base, combined with a recent $39 million tax-exempt financing with low interest rates, strengthened our balance sheet and will help lower our interest expense on an on-going basis. 
	
<P>
While the third and fourth quarters are traditionally periods when gas utilities generate losses due to the lack of sufficient weather-related revenues, NUI Corporation narrowed its third quarter loss to $0.10 per share, from a $0.24 per share loss a year ago.  The improvement in the company’s performance demonstrates our progress towards reducing our reliance on weather-driven business, including improved results from our energy sales and services group and customer services group.
	
<P>
In May, the company received the franchise rights to serve the growing community of Vero Beach in northeast Florida. We have also continued to attract new large volume customers to our distribution system with the advent of unbundled gas sales, where we serve as the open access provider of natural gas. We further increased the utilization of our 5,600 mile gas distribution network and total volumes of gas sold or transported jumped 21 percent during the nine month period ending June 30, 1996.
	
<P>
In June, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share of common stock, payable September 16, 1996, to shareholders of record on August 16, 1996. 
	
<P>
Further improving our per-customer margin revenues will be a benchmark of our success at strengthening our customer ties. During the first part of fiscal 1996, we increased the per customer sales figure by 6 percent, and our goal is to develop a wider array of products and services for our growing customer base. Focusing on the three key business areas of utility services, energy sales and services, and customer services, as well as further strengthening the management of our operations, have resulted in favorable earnings momentum. We look forward to reporting our continued progress at the end of this fiscal year. 

<P>

<CENTER><B>NATIONAL VISION ASSOCIATES, LTD. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER<BR>
OPERATING AND NET INCOME INCREASE</B></CENTER>

<P>

Lawrenceville, GA---October 22, 1996---National Vision Associates, Ltd. (Nasdaq: NVAL) today announced sales for the quarter ended September 28, 1996 were $41.3 million, a 9.6% increase over sales of $37.7 million in the comparable quarter last year.  Operating income for the quarter increased to $2.0 million from a loss of $626,000 in the third quarter of 1995.  Net income for the period was $1.2 million, or $0.06 per share, up from a loss of $873,000, or $0.04 per share, for the comparable period last year.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 28, 1996, sales advanced 10.3% to $122 million from $110.6 million in the same period a year ago.  Operating income rose substantially, increasing 112% to $6.2 million from $2.9 million in the first nine months of the prior year.  Net income for the nine-month period was $3.5 million, or $0.17 per share, up 344% from $778,000, or $0.04 per share, in the same period last year.

<P>

The increase in sales for the three- and nine-month periods was due to the opening of new domestic vision centers and increasing comparable store sales, offset in part by the disposition of operations in France and in Venture stores.  At September 28, 1996, the Company  operated 335 vision centers as compared to 302 vision centers at September 30, 1995.  Domestic comparable store sales increased by 3% in the third quarter and by 2.5% in the first nine months of 1996.

<P>

James W. Krause, Chairman of the Board, stated, "We are pleased with our continuous improvements in sales and operating profits over the comparable period a year ago.  Our efforts will remain focused on market share growth and improved profitability."

<P>

Vision center count information excludes the Company’s former operations in France and in Venture stores.  Those operations were disposed of in late 1995 and early 1996.

<blockquote><B>FISCAL 1997<BR>
FIRST QUARTER REPORT</B>
<P>
Dear Shareholder:
<P>

	We are pleased to report that fiscal 1997 has started on a very positive note, with revenues and earnings before a non-recurring charge up significantly in the first quarter, reflecting strong performances by Neiman Marcus Stores, NM Direct and Bergdorf Goodman.
	
<P>
For the 13 weeks ended November 2, 1996, revenues rose 11.1% to $544.1 million as a result of a 6.8% comparable revenue gain and contributions from new Neiman Marcus stores in King of Prussia, PA and Paramus, NJ.  Operating earnings increased 18.4% to $59.2 million, while net earnings before the one-time charge rose 23.4% to $30.9 million.  After preferred dividends and before the charge, earnings available to common shareholders were 62 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, up from 47 cents per share in the year-ago period.
	
<P>
 The Company recognized a previously-announced non-cash, after-tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 of $22.4 million, equal to 56 cents per share in the quarter, relating to its early redemption of all of its outstanding preferred stocks.  After that charge, The Neiman Marcus Group had net earnings applicable to common shareholders of 6 cents per share in the fiscal 1997 quarter.
	
<P>
The quarter's results were driven by an outstanding performance at Neiman Marcus Stores, where comparable revenues for the period rose 7.7%. Consumer demand was strong across merchandise categories and all geographic regions, enabling Neiman Marcus Stores to post a strong year-over-year gain in operating earnings.  
	
<P>
NM Direct's revenues rose 8.0% in the quarter.  Operating earnings also increased significantly, despite softness in some women's apparel catalogues that kept the sales gain below our expectations.
	
<P>
Bergdorf Goodman contributed higher earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 compared to a year ago due to improved gross margins and strong expense controls.  Bergdorf Goodman Men had a substantial revenue gain; however, the main store's revenues declined from a year earlier, resulting in overall flat revenues for Bergdorf Goodman in the quarter.
	
<P>
In October, the Company completed the sale of 8 million shares of common stock, raising $267 million.  Those proceeds, along with an additional 3.9 million common shares and $14 million in bank borrowings, were used to repurchase all of the Company's preferred stock from Harcourt General, Inc., on November 12, 1996.  Completion of the transaction eliminates future preferred dividend requirements of approximately $27 million annually and significantly strengthens the Company's balance sheet, providing improved financial flexibility as we continue to examine expansion  opportunities.
	
<P>
Inventories at the end of the fiscal 1997 first quarter were $533.9 million, compared to $477.1 million a year earlier.  The effect of the LIFO method of accounting for inventories compared to the FIFO method was to decrease pre-tax earnings by $2.0 million in both the current and year-ago quarters.
	
<P>
The strong first quarter results provide us with a positive outlook as we enter the important holiday selling season.  Sales growth is being driven by creative marketing and merchandising programs which, in combination with expense controls, are enabling us to achieve profit growth objectives.
<P>

Sincerely,</blockquote><P>

<B>Cupertino, Calif.  -- July 19, 1996</B> -- NetManage, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETM), the leading provider of standards-based IntraNet solutions, today reported second quarter 1996 results of operations.  Revenues and net income for the second quarter of 1996 were $26.8 million and $1.6 million ($0.04 per share), respectively.  Revenues and net income for the same quarter of 1995, which were restated to reflect the combined operating results of AGE Logic, Inc. and NetManage, Inc., were $32.0 million and $6.1 million ($0.14 per share), respectively.  Revenues and net income for the first six months of 1996 were $59.8 million and $6.7 million ($0.15 per share), respectively, compared to the restated revenues and net income of $59.0 million and $11.5 million ($0.27 per share), respectively, for the same six month period of 1995.  In the second quarter of 1996, revenues from single orders greater than $100,000 were approximately $2.7 million .
<P>

 "We believe that our second quarter revenues were affected by the delayed release of Windows NT 4.0, the slow adoption of Windows 95 in corporate accounts and the general confusion within the IntraNet market, all of which caused delays in buying decisions.  However, we expect to see continued demand for standards-based IntraNet solutions within corporations.  As a leading provider of IntraNet solutions for Windows 95 and Windows NT, we are well poised to capitalize on the corporate adoption of these platforms in the second half of 1996," said Zvi Alon, NetManage president and CEO.  
<P>

The second quarter marked continued investment in technologies and businesses targeted at addressing the  IntraNet market.  The acquisition from Network Computing Devices, Inc. (NCD) of Z-Mail, the leading standards-based cross-platform Internet mail solution, poises NetManage to take full advantage of the growing opportunity in the expanding IntraNet messaging market.  The acquisition of Maximum Information, Inc. provides us with the technology to address the emerging market of Enterprise Web site management. 
<P>

Additionally,  NetManage announced it will be the technology supplier to Borland International with its ActiveX Internet Control Pack and be the core client software provider to Hewlett-Packard’s Broadband Internet Delivery System.  NetManage and Microsoft continued to broaden their relationship by working together to embed Visual Basic for Applications 5.0 through NetManage’s IntraNet product line.  NetManage was one of  nine vendors to participate and was the only IntraNet solutions provider among the new licensees.
<P>

(NASDAQ: NETM) develops, markets, and supports an integrated set of applications, servers and development tools for IntraNet collaboration, access, development and management on the Microsoft Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT and Mac OS platforms.

<B><I>To Our Shareholders:</I>
</B>
<P>

During the quarter  we completed the development of
several new products that enable the Company for 
the first time to provide an end-to-end solution for
distributed network access.  We are optimistic that
these new products bring a comprehensive set of
features to our U.S., European and Japanese
markets.  While we are extremely pleased with the
progress of our development efforts, the resulting
products were not available for shipment until late in
the quarter.  As such, they did not have a significant impact on the first quarter revenue. 

<P>

Net sales for the first quarter of 1996 were $3.2 million compared with $4.5 million in the same period of 1995.   The Company reported a net loss of $2.2 million for the first quarter of 1996, or  $0.20 per share, compared to net income of $374,000 for the same period of 1995, or $0.05 per share.  Revenue for  the quarter was slightly below expectations as the Company invested in bringing new products to market.   Expenses were below budget as the Company held the line on spending during the quarter.

<P>

Sales in Europe included $2.4 million from the sale of Fivemere products.  We are very pleased with the performance of Fivemere and its prospects for 1996.  During the quarter, Fivemere introduced its new high speed inverse multiplexer module, QHS, which started shipping in late March.  With QHS, Fivemere is now able to satisfy the needs of the high speed backup market using exclusively Fivemere products.
  
<P>

As previously announced, sales of the Company’s products in Japan continued to be weak in the first quarter as Soliton Systems, the Company’s exclusive Japanese distributor, had sufficient inventory to cover its customer requirements. The Company’s products have been approved for  use under NTT’s Track procurement program for its fiscal year beginning April 1, 1996.

<P>

The Company continued the expansion of its product line based on the Universal Access Architecture (UAA) introduced in late 1995.  During the quarter, new enhancements were added to UAA which consolidates and enhances the entire software feature set of the Company’s distributed network access technology into a single product family.  Using UAA, the NE InterHub central site solution now supports the leading wide area network technologies including ISDN, Frame Relay over PPP, X.25, dedicated lines and analog modems.  UAA 6.1 expands the multi-protocol capability of the NE InterHub by adding IPX routing to the existing IP routing and bridging capability.  This allows offices with Novell NetWare® simultaneous access with their IP devices and other bridged protocols.  The network management and control capabilities of UAA were enhanced to support IP telnet management of bridged connections and multi-system central management.  Interoperability was also expanded to include new PPP protocols for compression (CCP) and encryption (ECP).

<P>

In March, we began shipment of the NE Digital Modem and the NE Fusion product.  Both products have been well received by the market. The NE Fusion product works in conjunction with Novell’s NetWare MultiProtocol Router® to provide UAA-based ISDN access to the large installed base of NetWare LANs worldwide.  In early April, the Company demonstrated the NE Fusion  product in the Novell Partner’s booth at the NetWorld+InterOp trade show.  The Company’s new small office - home office (SOHO) remote network access product, NE Nomad, is generating excitement in the marketplace.  NE Nomad was announced in March and is targeted for shipment in the second quarter.  NE Nomad is available as either a bridge or a router and is competitively priced starting at $795.  Along with existing central site products, the NE Nomad enables the Company to provide a complete end-to-end solution for internetworking, telecommuting and Internet access applications.

<P>

We are excited with the progress made by our new sales office in Munich, Germany to meet the demands of the fast-growing market for ISDN products throughout continental Europe.  During the quarter key distribution agreements were signed with Raab Karcher Elektronik GmbH for Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Benelux and Linné Data Delecta for Scandinavia. Four  new employees were hired for the European sales office, all highly experienced in selling and supporting ISDN remote access solutions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>October 23, 1996

<P>

To Our Stockholders:

<P>

	We are very pleased to report that Newport Corporation continued its progress in the third quarter of 1996, achieving a 50% increase in net earnings on a 21% improvement in sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 1996 over the prior year quarter.  The Company also posted substantially improved sales and earnings for the nine-month period of 1996.   
	
<P>
For the third quarter, net income advanced 50% to $1,116,000, equal to $0.12 per share, compared with $744,000, or $0.08 per share, for the corresponding period last year.  Net sales increased 21% to $29,235,000 from $24,253,000 in the third quarter of 1995.  
	
<P>
Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 rose 25% to $3,034,000, or $0.34 per share, from $2,425,000, or $0.28 per share, in the prior year period.  The 1995 period included non-recurring investment income totaling $499,000, net of taxes, or $0.06 per share.  Sales for the nine months were $87,331,000, up 18 percent from $74,094,000 in the same period a year ago.  
	
<P>
The gains Newport achieved in the third quarter are particularly significant since they support our overall growth strategy -- a greater focus on commercial markets, growth through acquisition, geographic diversification and continued investment in research for development of new products.  Our most recent acquisitions -- RAM Optical, Light Control Instruments and MikroPrecision Instruments -- continue to enhance Newport's overall performance with sales of their commercial products into the fiber optic communications, semiconductor and disk drive markets.  At the same time, we are realizing overall increased sales from our well-established vibration control and photonics products and our presence in the global science and laboratory arena. 
	
<P>
The third quarter gains from higher sales in the United States and the Pacific Rim were partially offset by continued weakness in the Company's sales in France primarily because of the impact of reduced government funding for large research projects.  Although we cannot predict the duration of the reduced activity in France, it is significant to note that our overall improvement is being achieved in spite of this situation. 
	
<P>
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, declined for both the third quarter and nine-month periods.  Research and development expenses, primarily to further develop technologies for new commercial markets, remained approximately the same percentage of sales in both the 1996 and 1995 periods.  As in earlier 1996 quarters, net income also reflected higher interest expense, primarily as a result of debt related to the acquisition of MikroPrecision Instruments in January 1996.
	
<P>
RAM Optical Instrumentation expects to deliver more than $2.0 million of its new Automated Vision Inspection Systems this year to a major customer in the computer peripherals business.  These orders involve systems for high volume, sub-micron inspection for proprietary computer components.  These shipments further underscore Newport's rapidly evolving penetration of commercial markets.  
	
<P>
We have implemented this new format in the interest of providing our stockholders and friends with more timely information, within a more cost effective vehicle.  We hope you agree that this is an improvement and encourage you to let us have the benefit of your comments; a copy of our Form 10Q is available on request.  In addition to the traditional forms (letter, telephone, and fax), Newport management can be communicated with via e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:investor@newport.com">investor@newport.com</A> or we invite you to visit our Internet home page at <A HREF="http://www.newport.com">http://www.newport.com</A>.  
	
<P>
This letter contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties as discussed in Newport’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.  The inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by Newport or any other person that Newport’s objectives or plans will be achieved.
<P>

	We look forward to reporting Newport's continued progress in the months ahead.   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Third Quarter Report November 11, 1996</B>
<P>

To Our Stockholders:

<P>

 	National Health Investors, Inc.'s efforts to build a future continue to yield results.   A dividend of 70 cents per common share is being paid on November 11 to stockholders of record on September 29.  Also, in addition to the regular quarterly dividend, a special dividend of 10 to 15 cents per common share will be paid on February 10, 1997 to stockholders of record on November 29.
	
<P>
NHI is making this special dividend payment because several companies prepaid their debt. The prepayment penalties received plus the successful reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds and the collection of commitment fees generates a unique opportunity to distribute earnings to  investors.
	
<P>
NHI achieved record levels of net income, funds from operations and revenues during the third quarter ended September 30. Net income increased 25% to $16,939,000. Net income per fully diluted common share increased 9% to 71 cents. Quarterly funds from operations (FFO), on a fully diluted basis, increased 23% for the three months to $20,983,000. FFO per share on a fully diluted basis increased 
 8% to 78 cents for the three months ended September 30. Revenues for the third quarter are up 12% to $25,275,000. 
	
<P>
Operating results for the nine months period show similar increases with net income up 35%, fully diluted FFO per share up 8% and revenues up 11%. 
	
<P>
At September 30, NHI owned real estate and mortgage investments of $707 million in 233 health care properties located in 26 states.
	
<P>
We want to thank you for your investment and confidence in NHI.  We are enthusiastic about the opportunities that await us in the future and look forward to a year of continued growth and profit.

Sincerely,

<CENTER><B>SECOND QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 1996 RESULTS</B></CENTER><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Shareholders:
<P>


	The Company’s financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 again were at record levels for revenues, net income and, most importantly, funds from operations.  The record results were primarily due to the investment activity consummated by the Company in 1995 and by internal growth in the Company’s portfolio.  

<P>

	For the three months ended June 30, 1996, funds from operations increased 10% over the same quarter in the previous year to $17,153,000.  On a per share basis, funds from operations was $.44 compared to $.42 in the second quarter of 1995, an increase of 5%.  The increase in funds from operations resulted from a 17% increase in revenues earned from the rentals of the new properties acquired during the past year.

<P>

	For the six month period ended June 30, 1996, funds from operations were up 12% to $33,844,000.  Funds from operations per share increased 6% to $.87 compared to $.82 for the first half of 1995.

<P>

	During the quarter, the Company declared and paid its quarterly dividend of $.37 per share, representing a payout of 84% of its funds from operations for the quarter.  This conservative pay-out level continues to provide low-cost, internally generated cash to fund additional investments which, in turn, increase the Company’s funds from operations.

<P>

	During the second quarter, the Company completed $7 million in new investments, which brings the total year-to-date new investments to $24 million.  These investments consisted of three assisted living facilities with 373 units and two nursing homes with 156 beds.  These transactions were all completed with existing customers of the Company.  The level of investment activity during the first half of the year was somewhat less than anticipated, but based upon the activities currently underway, the Company would expect to consummate a dollar volume of new investments in the third quarter that is more than double the amount completed during the first half of the year.  All of the new investments consist of long-term care facilities and will represent strong additions to the Company’s portfolio.

<P>

	During the second quarter, the Company reduced borrowings under its unsecured three-year revolving bank credit agreement by $61 million with the proceeds from an underwritten issuance of common shares.  The Company sold 3,047,500 shares priced at or $21.125 through a very successful underwriting managed by five investment banking firms.  As a result of this transaction, the Company’s conservative financial position is  further strengthened, enabling the Company to continue its growth with attractive investments.

<P>

	As we enter the second half of this fiscal year, management remains confident in its ability to continue to increase the Company’s funds from operations and, in turn, the shareholders’ dividends.

<B>3rd Quarter 1996 
<P>
 
REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS </B>

<P>

Dear Shareholders:

<P>

The third quarter was one in which Nocopi registered consolidated revenues of $950,000 and a net loss of $160,000.  While we were encouraged to see the top of our income statement showing quarterly revenues which begin to approach the million dollar level, the loss shown at the bottom of the statement was larger than we had expected earlier in the year.  This reflected among other things changes in our product mix which increased our cost of sales and changes in our relationship with Georgia-Pacific Corporation in addition to the restructuring which we reported to you several weeks ago.  This restructuring reduces the license fees we will be receiving from Georgia-Pacific in the short term, but by limiting the extent of Georgia-Pacific's exclusivity, we believe the change will open up parts of the check printing market for direct sales in a way that will increase our returns over time.  In another area which we believe will be helpful in the long run despite increasing our costs in the quarter just ended, we have added new sales people in both the United States and Europe.  Our expectations are that this will lead to increased sales and profits in the future. Our recent sales activities have shown signs of progress in the forms printing market and in security products for automotive and fashion customers. We wish all of our shareholders a happy holiday season and a healthy and happy 1997, and we look forward to a positive year for Nocopi as well.

Sincerely,

NOTE:  The accounts and results of operations of Euro-Nocopi S.A. are included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements because of the substantial control Nocopi Technologies exercises over Euro-Nocopi.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The amount included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for "Cash and temporary cash investments" includes $1.8 million in cash and temporary cash investments of Euro-Nocopi.  The 82% interest of the shareholders of Euro-Nocopi other than Nocopi Technologies is shown as "Ownership interest of others in consolidated entity" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

<B>Report to Shareholders</B>

<P>

	Net sales were $145.2 million for the first quarter ended October 31, 1996, compared to $160.9 million in the prior year. The Company recorded a net loss for the period of $2.0 million, or $.08 per share, versus net income of $4.7 million, or $.19 per share in the year ago period.
<P>

	We were dissatisfied with first quarter results.  As previously reported, fiscal 1997 earnings are being impacted by the greatly reduced order levels going into the first quarter.  These reductions were directly related to the uncertainties surrounding labor negotiations, which were successfully concluded on July 31, 1996.  Volumes through our medium and heavy structural rolling mills, which generally account for approximately fifty percent of our business, were down significantly in the first quarter.  On the other hand, we saw strong performance from our rod and wire operations as well as the small structurals business, each of which showed good volume gains compared to the prior year, although at somewhat lower pricing levels.  Shipments of semi-finished steel were substantially higher in the quarter, as we chose to produce those products until order levels improved to permit scheduling of greater production in the rolling mills.  However, margins on semi-finished steel sales are lower than finished products and general market prices for semi-finished steel were lower than the prior year.

<P>
	Orders for medium structural products have improved and pricing appears to have stabilized.  However, we have not yet been able to reach large structural production levels comparable to the prior year, despite firm markets for those products. We are working very hard to improve the performance and profitability of our structural business.

<P>
	Operations were profitable as the quarter came to a close.  Product mix has improved and shipments of value added finished products are expected to be a greater percentage of volume in the months ahead.  We also expect improved profitability in our large and medium structural business.  Our businesses are poised to reach market share levels which were achieved prior to the labor related falloff.  Recent favorable developments in scrap costs and improved operating performance provide the bases for improved profitability going forward.

<CENTER><B>NOVACARE ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING CHARGE AND THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., May 1, 1996 -- NovaCare, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today announced a loss of $8.6 million or $.13 per share for the three months ended March 31, 1996 reflecting a $13.4 million restructuring charge and a $10.5 million charge to increase accounts receivable reserves.  
Adjusting for these charges, net income was $6.9 million, or $.11 per share for the third quarter, which compared with $.14 per share for the three months ended March 31, 1995.

<P>

The $13.4 million pretax restructuring charge was associated with the previously announced consolidation and reorganization of the company’s outpatient rehabilitation services division with its orthotics and prosthetics business in order to take advantage of  market opportunities and to realize efficiencies in marketing, sales and operations.  The after-tax impact of the restructuring charge was $8.7 million or $.13 per share.

<P>

In addition, third quarter revenues reflected a $10.5 million pretax charge to increase accounts receivable reserves.  The charge was necessitated principally by increasing payor allowances that had not been sufficiently recognized by certain billing systems.  The company has implemented a new methodology for estimating allowances pending implementation of a fully integrated billing system in the upcoming year.  The after-tax impact of this charge was $6.8 million or $.11 per share.

"This was a quarter of mixed results," said John H. Foster, chairman and chief executive officer.  "Improved performance in the contract services business was offset by pricing pressures and disappointing same-store results in the outpatient business.  In addition, the regulators have again failed to resolve reimbursement issues in the nursing home industry, our largest customer base.  "A restructuring of the outpatient business is underway, which we expect will reduce our costs of operation by approximately $10-15 million annually," said Mr. Foster.  "We have initiated discussions with several integrated delivery systems as one way to bolster same store growth.  This approach is working well in Atlanta, where we recently formed a joint venture with Columbia/HCA to jointly provide inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services under NovaCare management."

<P>

Adjusting for the inclusion of the medical rehabilitation hospital business results in last year’s third quarter and the recent quarters’ charge to increase accounts receivable allowances, net revenues were even with the third quarter of fiscal 1995. The contract services business improved from the third quarter of fiscal 1995 principally as a result of a restructure of the business, announced in December 1995.  The orthotics and prosthetics business also improved, principally as a result of higher patient volume, an improved mix of patients, and successful cost containment initiatives.  Outpatient revenues and margins were down primarily due to a decrease in same store revenues, higher therapist salaries and increased accounts receivable allowances. NovaCare’s post-acute management and consulting services continued to grow, adding 50 new contracts during the quarter.

<P>

<I><B>Cautionary Statement.</B> Except for historical information, matters discussed above are forward-looking statements that are based on management’s estimates, assumptions and projections.  Important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those expected by management include the timing and nature of reimbursement changes (including imposition of, and changes in, salary equivalency rates for Medicare, changes in workers’ compensation and other governmental rate and reimbursement system changes), the number and productivity of clinicians, decisions by managed care and other third party contracts, the direction and success of competitors, management retention and development, management’s success in developing and introducing new products and lines of business and unanticipated market changes.</I>

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

Novellus reported net sales for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1996. Net sales for the quarter were $121.6 million, an increase of  21% over third quarter 1995 net sales of $100.4 million. Net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $25.1 million or $1.53 per share, up 15% and 20%, respectively over the third 
quarter 1995 net income of  $21.9 million or $1.27 per share.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net sales were $357.1 million, an increase of 35% from net sales of $263.9 million in the same period of 1995. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $77.2 million or $4.68 per share, up 34% and 39%, respectively from the $57.7 million or $3.37 per share reported in
the comparable period of 1995.

<P>

Cash and short-term investment balances at $172.0 million achieved record quarterly levels, and are 15% above the $149.8 million reported at December 31, 1995.

<P>

We were pleased that we were able to maintain sequentially flat revenues given the difficult market condition for Semiconductor Capital Equipment makers. Unfortunately, bookings have dropped significantly this quarter resulting in less than a 1:1 Book to Bill ratio. Our expenses grew modestly during the quarter causing our net income per share to be down slightly from the second quarter.

<P>

Despite the plateau in revenues and decline in orders we are committed to our long-term investment strategy in new products. We will prudently slow the growth of expenses within the Company, but will maintain the levels of Research and Development needed to be a leader in the industry. During the third quarter we demonstrated our commitment to new products with the announcement and delivery of new Altus, Sequel, and SPEED systems with footprints that have been reduced 45%, thus improving throughput density for our customers.

<CENTER><B>NOVEN ANNOUNCES CANADIAN <BR>
LAUNCH OF VIVELLE™ </B></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><B>New Estrogen Skin Patch to be Sold by<BR>
Ciba-Geigy Canada Ltd.</B></CENTER><P>


	<B>MIAMI, FL.  June 27, 1996</B> -- Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:NOVN) today announced the introduction of Vivelle™ (estradiol transdermal system) for the Canadian market. Vivelle, which will be marketed by Ciba-Geigy Canada Ltd. utilizes Noven's advanced transdermal matrix technology.  This design, whereby the active ingredient is incorporated in the adhesive, allows for a patch that is small, thin, flexible and translucent.  Vivelle is applied twice weekly and  delivers smooth, consistent levels of 17-beta estradiol through the skin and into the bloodstream.  With Vivelle, women who need to replace the estrogen that is lost during menopause will have a new option in hormone replacement therapy.
	
<P>
Available by prescription, Vivelle is indicated for the relief of menopausal and post-menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness.  Vivelle is the first estrogen skin patch to offer four dosage strengths.  This new treatment option allows physicians to maintain patients on the lowest possible dose of estrogen in skin patch form. 
	
<P>
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is an industry leader in the development and commercialization of transdermal and transmucosal drug delivery systems.

<CENTER><B><I>MENOREST </I></B><B>HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY APPROVED IN FIVE ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES FOR TREATMENT OF POSTMENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND PREVENTION OF OSTEOPOROSIS</B></CENTER>

<P>


	ANTONY, FRANCE and COLLEGEVILLE, PA, July 11, 1996 -- Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Inc. (NYSE: RPR) announced today that the Company's new hormone replacement therapy (HRT), <I>Menorest </I>(transdermal 17-beta estradiol), has been approved for use in Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Switzerland and Uruguay for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of osteoporosis.  <I>Menorest</I> is now approved in 23 countries.  
	
<P>
The <I>Menorest</I> patch is designed to be comfortable, cosmetically-appealing and easy to use.  It incorporates innovative matrix patch technology, licensed by RPR from Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NOVN), in which the adhesive functions as both the drug platform and as a means of affixing the patch to the skin.  The result is a patch that is small, thin, flexible and translucent.
	
<P>
<I>Menorest</I> was approved in several dosage strengths, which may help meet the estrogen needs of different women.  <I>Menorest</I> delivers 17-beta estradiol into the bloodstream continuously for three to four days, providing blood levels of estrogen that are very close to those seen in women before menopause.  All of these benefits may lead to improved compliance with HRT.
	
<P>
Menopause normally occurs in women around the age of 50 when blood estrogen levels fall, causing unpleasant symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness.  It is estimated, for example, that in Italy, about nine million women are presently in the menopausal age range (45 - 65).

<P>
	In May 1996, RPR and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) agreed to form the first worldwide strategic alliance designed to meet the hormone replacement needs of women in the menopausal age range.  The alliance will involve the promotion of both companies' hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products, including <I>Menorest</I>, by each company's field force on a worldwide basis with the exception of Japan.
	
<P>
Novo Nordisk A/S is the world leader in insulin and diabetes care and also manufactures and markets a variety of other pharmaceutical products.  Furthermore, the company is the world's largest producer of industrial enzymes.  Headquartered in Denmark, Novo Nordisk employs approximately 13,000 people in 54 countries and markets its products in 130 countries.  Its B shares are listed on the stock exchanges in Copenhagen, London, Basel, Zurich and Geneva.  Its ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NVO.
	
<P>
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: NOVN) is the innovator of the matrix technology used in <I>Menorest</I> and is an industry leader in the development and commercialization of transdermal and transmucosal drug delivery systems.
	
<P>
Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Inc. is a global pharmaceutical company dedicated to improving human health.  The Company had sales of $5.316 billion (pro forma) and invested more than $826 million (pro forma) in research and development in 1995.

To Our Shareholders:
<P>
	NVR reported an increase of 41% in net income to $8.3 million ($0.59 per share) for the third quarter of 1996, compared to $5.9 million ($0.38 per share) for the same quarter of 1995.  Total revenues increased 21% over the same period of last year to $323.2 million primarily due to an 18% increase in home settlements during the quarter.
<P>
	For the quarter, new orders declined by 15% when compared to the same quarter of 1995.  We attribute this decline to the uncertainty in interest rates and to the general economic environment.  In spite of competitive market conditions and increased lumber costs, NVR continues to maintain acceptable margins, 13.5% in the 3rd quarter from 13.7% in the same period last year.  The significant increase in homebuilding revenues resulted in a more efficient use of our overhead and capital structure, increasing pre-tax income from homebuilding operations from 4.5% to 5.1% of homebuilding revenues.
<P>
	Pre-tax income from our mortgage banking operations for the third quarter of 1996 improved slightly when compared to the same quarter of 1995.  The Financial Services segment generated $0.4 million of operating income during the quarter after incurring a $1.1 million  pre-tax charge related to the sale of approximately $740 million of its mortgage servicing portfolio.  This compares favorably to the prior year  quarter which included a $1 million non-recurring restructuring charge.
<P>
	Continuing NVR’s strategy of maximizing shareholder value, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock as well as 0.6 million NVR warrants during the first nine months of 1996.  As a result of the warrant exercise and the repurchase programs mentioned above, 14,708,000 shares of common stock are currently outstanding.

On July 25, 1996, Octel Communications Corporation announced the highest level of quarterly and annual revenues and earnings in its 14 year history.  For the fourth quarter ended June 30, 1996, net revenues were $173,326,000, net income was $20,207,000 and earnings per share were $0.37, representing increases over the same period last year of 28%, 62% and 48%, respectively.  Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 included charges related to the Company’s fiscal 1994 merger.  Excluding these charges, fourth quarter fiscal 1995 net income and earnings per share would have been $12,867,000 and $0.26, respectively.

<P>

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, net revenues were $563,602,000, up 19% over last fiscal year.  Net income for fiscal 1996 was $50,784,000, up 63% from fiscal 1995.  Earnings per share were $0.95 compared to $0.63 for fiscal 1995, an increase of 51%.  Earnings for fiscal 1995 included charges related to acquired in-process research and development as well as charges related to the Company’s fiscal 1994 merger with VMX.  Excluding these charges, fiscal 1995 net income and earnings per share would have been $36,308,000 and $0.73, respectively.

<P>

I am very pleased with the records we’ve set this year and the tremendous progress we’ve made in fiscal 1996.  We have a good strategy and we are working hard to execute it.  We have superb products, gained market share, hit great records in revenues, profits, profitability, customer satisfaction levels and employee satisfaction.  We think the markets we serve have strong potential and we will work diligently to exploit this potential.  We set out a few years ago to rebuild the company and get out in front again.  I think it’s fair to say that we went a long way to achieving that this past fiscal year.  We have lots more to do and we plan to attack our challenges as aggressively as possible.  We think we’ve just begun.

<P>

We thank our investors and customers for your support this fiscal year.  We at Octel will do our best to continue to earn your trust and confidence.

<CENTER><B>1996 Third Quarter Shareholder Report	</B></CENTER>											
To Our Shareholders	
<P>
											
<B>Dividend Increase</B><BR>

												
We are pleased to report an increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate, from $.32 to $.34 per share, effective	in the fourth quarter of 1996.  The dividend is payable	December 13, 1996, to shareholders of record on November 15, 1996.  The new cash dividend rate of $.34 per share is an 11.5% increase over the dividend rate for the same period last year and includes the effect of a 5% stock dividend paid on July 25, 1996, to	shareholders of record on June 25, 1996.  The fourth quarter dividend payment will mark the 24th annual cash dividend increase and the 97th consecutive quarterly dividend paid since Old Kent Financial Corporation was formed in 1972.												
	
<P>
											
<B>Increased Earnings</B><BR>	
											
We are pleased to report increased earnings for the third quarter of 1996.  Net income per common share for the three months ended September 30, 1996, was $.87, up 8.8% from the $.80 per share earnings for the third quarter of 1995. For the first three quarters of 1996, net income per common share was $2.48 and represented a 7.8% increase over per share earnings of $2.30 for the first nine months of 1995.  For the third quarter of 1996, net income was $40.3 million, an increase of 5.2% over net income of $38.3 million earned during last year's third quarter.  Return on average shareholders' equity was 16.32% for the third quarter of 1996, compared to 15.53% for the year ago quarter.  For the nine months ended September 30, return on average equity was 15.52% for 1996 and 15.53% for 1995.  Return on average total assets was 1.30% and 1.31% for the third quarters of 1996 and 1995 respectively.												

<P>
												
<B>Financial Highlights</B>
<BR>											
<UL>
<LI> For the quarter, earnings per share and return on equity have been favorably influenced by Old Kent's stock repurchase programs authorized in June of 1996.  Through September 30, 1996, Old Kent had repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its common stock with the intent of future reissuance.												
												
<LI> Non-interest revenues increased $8.8 million, or 20%, for the third quarter of 1996 compared to the same period last year.  Net mortgage banking revenues contributed the largest increase of $3.4 million, up 28%. At September 30, 1996, Old Kent serviced $9.6 billion of mortgages for third parties, over 50% more than the	$6.3 billion serviced twelve months prior.  This growth includes the effect of business acquisitions.												
												
<LI>Old Kent recorded a special, one-time $1.7 million (pre-tax) charge on September 30, 1996.  The charge reflected a special assessment by the FDIC to Old Kent and many other financial institutions.  This assessment was intended to recapitalize the FDIC's Savings Association Insurance Fund.												
</UL>

<P>
												
<B>Corporate Highlights</B>	<BR>
											
On August 1, 1996, Old Kent completed the acquisition of National Pacific Mortgage Corporation of Anaheim, California.  National Pacific originates mortgages through 17 retail and wholesale branch offices in California and Oregon, and	 through relationships with large realty companies.  When acquired, National Pacific had a residential servicing portfolio of $1.8 billion.  It will operate as an affiliate of Old Kent Mortgage Company.												

<P>
												
Also in August, Old Kent and Seaway Financial Corporation signed a definitive agreement for the previously announced merger of Seaway into Old Kent.  Seaway is a bank holding company with assets of $362 million at September 30, 1996.  It is the parent company of The Commercial and Savings Bank of Saint Clair County and Algonac Savings Bank.  The merger is subject to customary approvals and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 1996 or the first quarter of 1997.												

<P>
												
We look forward to continued success in 1996, and appreciate your continued support.	</BLOCKQUOTE>

Dear Shareholders:

<P>

Old National Bancorp performed well during the third
quarter of 1996, posting primary earnings per share of 
$.61, a 13.0% increase from 1995's third quarter results
of $.54 per share.  Net income for the third quarter rose 
to $15.2 million, compared to $14.0 million earned during
the same period last year.  During the quarter, Old 
National Bancorp's total assets passed the $5 billion 
mark, reconfirming our leadership position as Indiana's 
largest independent bank holding company.

<P>

Year-to-date, Old National's net income grew 10.5% to $44.3 million.  Primary earnings per share rose to $1.76, or 13.5% from the $1.55 achieved during the first nine months of 1995.  This strong performance reflects the company's continued emphasis on loan quality.  In fact, at the end of September Old National's under-performing assets amounted to only .51% of total loans, a consistently favorable comparison to our peers.

<P>

During the first three quarters of 1996, Old National's loan demand remained strong, growing at almost a 10% annualized pace.  Given our hometown philosophy, we believe our banks are in the best position to satisfy the borrowing needs of their customers and provide an outstanding level of service unmatched by our competition.  As an extension of this philosophy, we are pleased to announce an expanded commitment to our customers in the community of Harrisburg, Illinois, who will enjoy being served by a new $3 million main office facility by the end of this year.

<P>

On October 19, 1996, Old National consummated its 36th merger with Workingmens Federal Savings Bank of Bloomington, Indiana.  The addition of Workingmens added an additional $200 million in assets and 1,400 shareholders to the company.  Workingmen's has been combined with ONB Bank in Bloomington to form one entity, Workingmens/ONB Bank.  This merger not only allows us to extend our franchise in Central Indiana, but also improves Old National's market share in a rapidly growing segment of the state.

<P>

On October 24, 1996, your board of directors declared a regular cash dividend of $.23 per share, payable on December 16, 1996, to shareholders of record on December 2, 1996.

<P>

We appreciate your continued support as customers and shareholders of Old National Bancorp and remain committed to providing you with the best possible service and return on your investment.

<P>

Sincerely,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>To Our Shareholders:</B>
<P>

Olympic Financial Ltd. continued its strong performance during the second quarter ended June 30, 1996, as we met or exceeded our financial performance goals for the ninth consecutive quarter.  Net income for the quarter reached $14.7 million or $0.40 per fully diluted share.  This represents a 122 percent increase over net income of $6.6 million or $0.25 per fully diluted share, before extraordinary item, earned in the second quarter of 1995.  For the six months ended June 30, 1996, net income totaled $25.8 million or $0.76 per share, compared with net income of $10.1 million or $0.44 per fully diluted share, before extraordinary items, in the first half of 1995, increases of 156 and 73 percent, respectively.

<P>

Revenues for the second quarter increased 97 percent to $49.5 million from $25.2 million in the same period last year.  For the first six months of 1996, revenues totaled $93.5 million, an increase of 127 percent from $41.2 million for the first six months of 1995.

<P>

Compared to the first quarter of 1996, net income increased 33 percent and earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 8 percent, despite a significant increase in the number of shares outstanding during the second quarter.  In April, Olympic completed the public sale of 8,050,000 shares of Common Stock at $19.25 per share.   

<P>

As we continue to experience rapid portfolio growth, we recognize the significance of maintaining a conservative reserve level for potential loan losses.  Loan loss reserves for the Company were increased $12.4 million during the quarter, for a total loan loss reserve level of $67.5 million.  This represents 2.25 percent of our total servicing portfolio, up from 2.08 percent or $55.1 million in reserves at March 31, 1996.    

<P>

Automobile loans purchased in the second quarter totaled $657.9 million, an increase of 40 percent from $470.6 million in loans purchased during the same period last year.  Olympic’s total loan purchases, since its inception in March of 1990, now exceed $4.5 billion.

<P>
<CENTER><B>
PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

Olympic’s loan servicing portfolio nearly doubled in just one year and totaled just over $3 billion at June 30, 1996.  We benefited from a shift toward higher yielding Classic loans in our portfolio.  Classic loans represented 35 percent of total loans purchased during the second quarter of 1996 and currently account for 20 percent of our total loan portfolio.  The risk-adjusted profitability we have experienced with the recent growth in Classic loan purchases is very favorable and we will continue to pursue our goal of increasing Classic up to 50 percent of our total loan purchases on a flow basis.

<P>

Our delinquency and loan loss experience was in line with management’s expectations.  With the growth in Classic loan purchases and the seasoning taking place in our portfolio, we experienced total loans delinquent greater than 30 days at 1.95 percent, an expected increase from 1.69 percent in the first quarter of 1996.  Annualized net loan losses were 0.87 percent, up from 0.79 percent in the trailing quarter.

<P>

As always, an uncompromising commitment to maintaining superior credit quality remains fundamental to our business.

<P>

<CENTER><B>CAPITAL AND FUNDING PERFORMANCE</B></CENTER>
<P>


Olympic realized proceeds of approximately $147.5 million from the successful public offering of 8,050,000 shares of Common Stock in April.  In addition, Olympic increased its aggregate warehousing capacity to $700 million, up from $670 million.  The proceeds from these transactions were used to support the Company’s continued growth in automobile loan purchases during the quarter.

<P>

Also in June, Olympic priced a $650 million securitization, the largest in our six year history.  Total securitizations for the Company now exceed $4.4 billion, allowing Olympic to maintain its ranking as the fourth largest issuer of automobile backed securities in the nation.  We were very pleased during the quarter to receive an upgraded "B1" rating from Moody’s Investors Service on the Company’s $145 million issue of 13% Senior Notes due in the year 2000.  This brings us closer to our goal of achieving an investment grade company status.

<P>


<CENTER><B>
OUTLOOK  </B></CENTER>
<P>


As we look ahead, our opportunities for continued growth are abundant.  Olympic currently holds less than 1 percent of the enormous $410 billion automobile finance market.  We now have established relationships with more than 6,400 franchised automobile dealerships nationwide, in an industry of approximately 22,000 dealerships.  Our 17th Regional Buying Center recently opened in one of our most favorable markets, San Antonio, Texas.  The Company has firmly established its presence nationwide, operating through these 17 Regional Buying Centers in an expanding dealer network across 38 states.  With the evolution of our Classic program, we have been able to enhance our dealer relationships by providing more financing opportunities for them with Olympic.  We see great opportunity in the marketplace to continue meeting our projections going forward.

<P>


We are confident that 1996 will be another strong year for Olympic.  With the first half of the year behind us, we will continue to aggressively pursue meeting or exceeding all of our performance goals for this year, which will surely allow us continued recognition as the largest independent provider of automobile financing in the country today.  We will continue our commitments to superior performance and maximizing shareholder value.  We thank you for your continued support and welcome your comments and suggestions.

<B>SECOND QUARTER REPORT 1996</B>
<P>

To Our Fellow Shareholders:
<P>



The second quarter brought record revenues and record profits and we paved the way for continued performance in the second half with the integration of Enviro<I>Staff</I>, acquired in March. In addition, we developed and implemented two very effective new programs aimed at enhancing the productivity of our businesses.

<P>

Enviro<I>Staff</I>, now fully operational under the<I> On Assignment</I> model, including the Account Manager concept and custom developed, centralized support systems, had an excellent quarter. The discontinuation of duplicate administrative tasks and costs contributed to improved operating margins and focused attention on our primary purpose of making Quality Assignments.  Enviro<I>Staff</I> opened five new branches in the second quarter, sharing space at existing <I>On Assignment</I> locations.

<P>

A new company-wide process for the recruitment of Account Managers, developed in the first quarter, has generated encouraging results since its roll out in June. The new process has already enabled us to hire Account Manager apprentices faster and more efficiently than in the past with greater confidence in their ability to succeed.  We have hired more than 20 Account Manager trainees, who are among the most talented and motivated individuals ever recruited.

<P>

Following a successful 10-branch test during the second quarter, Assignment ReadySM, an innovative new program for introducing highly qualified professionals to clients and prospective employers, is being rolled out to all branches and all divisions this month. By pro actively presenting a selection of our best and brightest candidates to targeted clients and prospects, we are accelerating the assignment process, benefiting both clients and employees, and enhancing our role as a preferred provider of professional temporary employees.  Assignment ReadySM exemplifies the latest service delivery productivity improvement resulting from <I>On Assignment’s</I> continuous learning process.

<P>

Our financial performance during the quarter again reflected new records for both the number of clients and employees on assignment, as well as for Account Manager productivity. Our operating margin improved a full percentage point, to 10.2 percent, which helped to advance net income by 32 percent to $1,370,000, or $0.25 per share, from last year’s $1,035,000, or $0.20 per share.  Revenues rose 20 percent, to $21,438,000 from $17,812,000 a year ago.  All data has been restated for all periods to reflect pooling-of-interests accounting for the Enviro<I>Staff</I> acquisition.

<P>

The financial trends were similar for the first half. Operating income rose to $3,890,000 from $2,940,000, an increase of 32 percent. Including one-time Enviro<I>Staff</I> acquisition costs incurred in the first quarter of $401,000, or $0.04 per share, net income rose 19 percent to $2,228,000, or $0.41 per share, from $1,877,000, or $0.36 per share. The balance sheet remained strong at mid-year, with $11.4 million in cash and short-term investments, and no debt.

<P>

In summary, <I>On Assignment</I> approaches its fifth year as a public company with excellent prospects.  Building on a solid base of financial performance, in all  divisions, our new Account Manager recruitment and Assignment ReadySM initiatives enhance our opportunities for continued success.

<H3>Quarterly Report to Shareholders</H3>
<B>Dear Shareholders, Customers, Suppliers and Friends:</B>

<P>

We continued to make steady progress in the second quarter when compared to the last two quarters of 1995 and the first quarter of this year.  We started out in 1996 to show continuous improvement on a quarterly basis in three important financial areas: gross margin; selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense; and asset management.  It is important to note that we have put our emphasis on bottom line improvement rather than a more traditional way of improving our business through sales growth.  We have lost some unprofitable business, but we have also gained some new business to offset the loss, leaving our sales flat for the time being.

<P>

Let's take a look at the three areas targeted for improvement.  A price increase initiative toward the end of 1995, coupled with other enhancement programs, has been successful in increasing gross margin as a percent of net sales from 8.7% in the fourth quarter of 1995 to 9.6% in the first quarter of 1996 and to 9.9% in the second quarter.  SG&A has decreased by $2.6 million, from 8.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 1995 to 7.9% in the first quarter of this year and to 7.8% in this quarter.  The reduction of overtime and temporary help, the more effective utilization of the company's mainframe computer system, the reslotting of 22 warehouses for more efficient picking and operational efficiency contributed to this decline in SG&A.  Also, through an improved inventory management system in a majority of our facilities and a refocus on functional best practices within the company, we have improved the company's asset management performance and reduced our outstanding financing by approximately $41 million from the end of the first quarter of this year.

<P>

Additionally, during the second quarter the company completed its refinancing plan, achieving its objectives of creating a more diversified capital structure and improved interest rates.  The plan included a reduced bank revolving credit facility and an expanded accounts receivable securitization facility, as well as the issuance of $150 million in senior subordinated 10-year notes.  The $150 million senior debt offering was underwritten by a group led by J.P. Morgan & Co.

<P>

We are making good progress, and our plans call for that progress to accelerate in the second half of the year.  Although sales growth is anticipated to be relatively slow for the rest of 1996, we expect moderate second half sales improvement over the first half.  We continue to work diligently on improving our service to our customers and exceeding their expectations.  I am excited about and look forward to the second half of this year. 

<P>
Sincerely,<P>

<CENTER><B>ONEWAVE, INC. REPORTS THIRD QUARTER REVENUES OF $5,334,000<BR>
<I>Internet Applications Software Company Benefits from Strategic Sales Alliances</I></B></CENTER>

<P>


WATERTOWN, MA -- October 16, 1996 -- OneWave, Inc. (NASDAQ: OWAV) today announced revenues of $5,334,000 for the quarter ending September 30, up 69% over second quarter revenues of $3,152,000. The net loss for the third quarter was $379,000 ($.03 per share) compared to a net loss of $793,000 ($.06 per share) for the second quarter.  The company’s operating loss declined to 16% of revenue in the current quarter from 25% for the second quarter.

<P>

"Our third quarter performance reflects the increased demand from our alliance partners for our software to develop industry-specific Internet applications, as well as to resell and bundle OneWave™ software with their products.  This strong show of support validates our partner strategy," said OneWave Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Klaus P. Besier.  "We are also pleased by the addition of well-recognized companies such as Volkswagen of America, Inc., Dell Products LP, CNA Financial Corporation, Cadence Design Systems and others to our customer list." 

<P>

During the quarter, OneWave added Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), KPMG Peat Marwick LLP (KPMG), Red Pepper Software Company, and Trilogy Development Group, Inc. as strategic partners.  The company believes that its strategic relationships will generate new business opportunities, as partners develop standard applications using OneWave software products. For example, Hewlett-Packard (HP) is utilizing OneWave software to develop vertical retail applications, in conjunction with Internet Business Solutions, Inc. (IBS), for Nobody Beats the Wiz and another nationally recognized retailer.  In addition, Global Core Strategies, Inc. has teamed with OneWave and IBS to develop a service management application for a major computer manufacturer. These alliances represent a majority of third quarter revenue.  IBS is a joint venture between Samsung Corporation and certain of the Company’s principal shareholders.

<P>

"Applications such as those being developed by HP and Global Core Strategies present significant opportunities for the company," said Besier.  "We hope to see future growth from the deployment of these applications."

<B>Dear Shareholder:</B>
<P>



We are pleased to report that for the third quarter of fiscal 1996, OnTrak’s revenues reached a record $15.3 million, a 123 percent increase over the $6.9 million reported for the third quarter of fiscal 1995.  Net income for the quarter increased 251 percent, to $1.3 million ($0.16 per share on 8.2 million shares), compared to the $0.4 million posted for the same period last year, excluding the effect of a one-time $1.3 million charge for royalties. Including the one-time charge, the Company reported a net loss of $510,000 ($0.10 per share on 5.2 million shares) for the third quarter of the prior year. Gross profit of $8.0 million was up more than 100 percent, compared to the $3.9 million posted during the third quarter of last year.

<P>

CMP again dominated our revenues, and sales of our DSS-200 cleaning systems for post-CMP applications accounted for more than 80 percent of the quarter’s income.  Orders remained strong during the quarter both domestically and internationally, enabling us to maintain a book to bill ratio greater than one-to-one.  An increase in sales during the quarter to the Pacific Rim was primarily attributable to the shipment of several DSS-200 systems to a major Japanese customer using CMP.

<P>

This quarter marked an important milestone in our CMP linear planarization program—the completion of the testing phase for our Aurora CMP development module.  We are pleased to report that the results from a major U.S. customer verified the process capabilities of the tool.  Specifically, the results showed clear improvements over the customer’s existing process of record achieved through conventional orbital CMP techniques.  The module has now been returned to OnTrak, and the information and data obtained is being used to develop a production-version tool. We expect to ship a limited number of systems before the end of this calendar year.

<P>

In addition, the cooperative development effort to integrate our DSS-200 cleaning system with Applied Materials’ Mirra™ CMP system continues to progress.  Customers are indicating interest in the integrated system, and we expect to begin shipments in late calendar 1996.

<P>

 RECORD SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS RESULTS, EPS $0.27<BR> 
Applications License Revenues Show Strong Growth, up 77%

<p></b></CENTER><P>

<blockquote>Redwood Shores, Calif., December 12, 1996—Oracle Corporation today announced record second quarter results for the quarter ended November 30, 1996.  Revenues increased 36
percent to $1.311 billion from $967 million in the same period last year.  Net income for the period increased 31 percent to $179 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to net income of $137 million, or $0.20 per share, in the same period last year.  For the first six months of fiscal 1997, revenues increased 36 percent to $2.364 billion from $1.739 billion in the same period last year.  Net income for the period increased 30 percent to $292 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to net income of $224 million, or $0.33 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 1996, excluding the one-time $34 million after-tax acquisition charge for the IRI transaction in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Led by 77 percent growth in Applications license revenue, overall license sales in the second quarter grew by 25 percent year-to-year (24 percent when combined with other revenues.) Oracle Services (Support, Consulting and Education) grew by 48 percent when compared to the same period of fiscal 1996.  Geographically, Oracle reported solid performance worldwide, despite a 3 percentage point negative currency translation during the second quarter, with Asia Pacific impacted by a weaker yen.  Oracle Americas reported the strongest geographic revenue growth, up 49 percent, followed by Asia Pacific, up 44 percent, and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), up 16 percent, versus the same period last year.
<P>
Oracle made a number of significant announcements during the second quarter of fiscal 1997:
<P>
<LI> Oracleâ Universal Serverâ, which began shipping in March of this year, is the first multi-media server offering customers and developers a single-high-performance environment for managing relational, text, video, spatial and analytical data.
<LI> Oracle Corp. introduced Network Computing Architecture(TM), NCA, a cross-platform environment for developing and deploying object-based, network-centric applications, including robust Web applications.
<LI> Netscape Communications Corporation and Oracle Corp. announced strategic agreements through which the companies will integrate, market and distribute each others' products. Oracle will bundle Netscape Navigator with the Intel-based NC software operating environment produced by Oracle’s wholly owned subsidiary, Network Computer, Inc., and Oracleâ Universal Serverâ will be Netscape's preferred database for Commercial Applications.
<LI> Oracle Corp. and Datalogix International, Inc. announced the signing of a definitive agreement in which Oracle will acquire Datalogix, a leading provider of client/server software solutions for process manufacturing. The acquisition will be structured as a cash merger valued at US$94 million. Oracle will account for the deal as a purchase transaction and expects to complete the transaction by January 1, 1997.  
<LI> Oracle expects to deliver its complete suite of Java-enabled applications in the spring of 1997, well ahead of other client/server applications vendors including SAP, PeopleSoft and Baan.  This will allow "thin client" deployment of all its Applications which will significantly reduce cost and time to implement as well as upgrade new releases.
"This quarter further confirms the success of Oracle’s growth as a strategic technology and applications provider to the largest companies in the world," said Raymond J. Lane, Oracle’s President and Chief Operating Officer.  "More and more, customers are improving their business operations by leveraging Oracle’s leading edge technology stack, strategic partners and  value-added services."
<P>
Oracle Corp. is the world's second largest software company, and the largest supplier of software for information management.  With annual revenues of more than $4.8 billion, the company offers its database, tools and application products, along with related consulting, education, and support services, in more than 90 countries around the world.

<LI>The market for Oracle's products is intensely competitive  and is characterized by rapid technological advances, and frequent new product introductions.  There can be no assurances that Oracle will continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance.

<LI>Management's ability to manage growth, continuously hire significant numbers of qualified employees, forecast revenues and control expenses continues to be a challenge. An unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. 
<LI>Delays in product delivery or closing of sales can cause quarterly revenues and income to fall significantly short of anticipated levels.
<LI>Oracle is introducing new products for the Internet, on-line services, electronic commerce, interactive media and data warehousing; the market acceptance and contribution to Oracle's revenues cannot be assured.

<B>1996 THIRD QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>

<P>

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

Our financial results continued to improve in the third quarter of 1996.  Earnings for the quarter were $6,445,000, or $0.48 per share, on sales of $64,729,000.  During the third quarter of 1995, the Company reported a net loss of $439,000, or $0.04 per share, on sales of $41,236,000.  For the first nine months of 1996, earnings were $14,976,000, or $1.24 per share, compared to $549,000, or $0.05 per share, for the first nine months of 1995.  Total sales for the first nine months of 1996 were $174,798,000, an increase of 63% over the first nine months of 1995 sales of $107,199,000.

<P>

Increased shipments and pricing for the Company's major products were responsible for the increase in the Company's third quarter earnings.  We continue to benefit from the strength of the rebound occurring in the commercial aerospace market and the emergence of the titanium golf clubhead market in the United States.  The Company's twelve-month order backlog has increased $95 million, or 146%, to $160 million at September 30, 1996 from $65 million at September 30, 1995. 
 
<P>

On August 26, 1996, the Company completed an offering of 4,600,000 shares of its common stock for a price of $23.75 per share.  Proceeds from the offering, net of underwriting fees and expenses, amounted to approximately $103 million.  The Company has used approximately $18 million of the proceeds to pay down its U.S. revolving credit agreement. The balance of the proceeds will be used to construct a new electron beam furnace, expand the Company's distribution business, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.  

<P>

The recent growth in the use of titanium for golf clubheads represents the first significant demand for titanium as a replacement for steel in a consumer product.  Additionally, we are making inroads into the ballistic protection (armor) markets where titanium's superior weight to strength ratio outperforms traditional material.  As our recent financial results suggest, OREMET Titanium is well positioned to benefit from expanding applications for titanium.

<B>Dear Shareholder:</B><BR>
To reduce costs and speed delivery of financial
information to shareholders, we have replaced last 
year’s quarterly report format with this simplified 
version.  Call the Company at (612) 513-6900 should
you have any questions or comments.


<P>


<CENTER><B>ORPHAN MEDICAL, INC. THIRD QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>

<P>

For the three months ended September 30, 1996, the Company’s net loss was $2,201,499 or $.36 per share compared to a net loss of $1,258,181 or $.34 per share for the three months ended September 29, 1995.  The 1996 third quarter net loss is higher than the 1995 comparable period due to higher levels of development spending, particularly spending related to clinical trial activity.

<P>

During the third quarter, the Company achieved a significant milestone in its history: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted clearance to market our first product, Elliotts B™ Solution (buffered intrathecal electrolyte/dextrose injection).  Elliotts B Solution is indicated as a diluent for the intrathecal administration (injection into the cerebrospinal fluid) of methotrexate sodium and cytarabine for the prevention or treatment of meningeal leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma.  Leukemia and lymphomas are two of the main types of childhood cancers.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is primarily a childhood leukemia which accounts for more than 57% of childhood leukemias.  There are approximately 6,000 cases of ALL in the United States annually.

<P>

Just prior to releasing this report, FDA clearance for Cystadane™ (betaine anhydrous for oral solution) was also received.  Cystadane is the first drug for the treatment of patients with homocystinuria, a rare, genetic disorder caused by various inborn errors of metabolism.  We believe approximately 1,000 patients have homocystinuria and are threatened by the serious clinical manifestations of this disease.  We have begun investigating other uses for Cystadane that could involve larger numbers of patients.  Chronimed Inc. will distribute Cystadane on a direct-to-patient basis under a new agreement that allows each company to focus its respective strengths toward this product’s success.  In addition, we have licensed the rights to sell Cystadane in Australia and New Zealand to Orphan Australia, an Australian company that is unrelated to Orphan Medical.  Regulatory clearance in Australia was obtained by Orphan Australia on October 1, 1996.  Although revenues from this relationship will not be material, it represents our first international "out-licensing" arrangement.  We intend to develop similar relationships in other countries for Cystadane and other products.

<P>

The clearance of these two products illustrates Orphan Medical’s ability to successfully develop products and submit acceptable new drug applications (NDAs) to the FDA.  (An NDA is the document that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain marketing clearance for new prescription products.)  These two products were cleared by the FDA on the basis of NDAs where existing published clinical data were compiled and analyzed.  Our other projects involve clinical studies that we conduct through contract research organizations.  This process is controlled and directed by our internal directors of new medicine development who work closely with regulatory, marketing, and financial staff within the Company, as well as experts outside of the Company.

<P>

During the quarter we were awarded four grants totaling over $1.3 million to support four of the Company’s development projects: Busulfanex™ (busulfan) for injection, Colomed™ (short chain fatty acids) enema, Antizol™ (fomepizole) for injection, and Intrachol™ (choline chloride) for injection.  Three of the grants were awarded by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development, and the fourth was awarded by the Small Business Administration’s Small Business Innovation Research program.  The grants are expected to extend over one to three years and cover certain development activities planned for the four projects.

<P>

The clinical trials now underway for Busulfanex and Colomed are progressing, although the rate of patient enrollment is slower than planned.  We have added new clinical sites and taken other actions to increase the number of patients in the trials and to keep them on schedule.  We’ve also hired a director of clinical services whose primary role is to assist in the management of our clinical trials.

<P>

We continue to expect FDA clearance of Antizol-Vet™ (fomepizole) for injection in the fourth quarter.  Antizol-Vet is indicated for ethylene glycol (antifreeze) poisoning in dogs.  During the next few months, we also plan to submit NDAs for Antizol for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning in humans and Sucraid™ (Beta-D-fructofuranoside fructohydrolase) oral solution, an enzyme replacement therapy for treatment of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Fellow Shareholders and Employees:

<P>

	We are pleased to report increased earnings and increased loan origination volume for the third quarter of 1996, along with two important new agreements entered into by PacificAmerica Money Center, Inc. ("PAMM") after the close of the third quarter.  One,  a new loan sale and securitization agreement with Aames Capital Corporation ("Aames") and the second, a letter of intent to sell approximately $23.7 million of loans not previously held for sale, constituting the substantial majority of PAMM’s commercial loan portfolio, both as further described herein.

<P>

	Gains on sale of loans continue to represent the primary source of earnings of PAMM, and have increased as the volume of loans originated has expanded over the past two years.  The following table illustrates the increase in volume of loans originated for sale, loans sold, and gains on sale of loans during each of the four quarters of 1995 and the three most recent quarters of 1996:

<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="PAMMFIN5.gif"></CENTER>
<P>

   PAMM reported total consolidated net income of $798,000, or $0.39 for primary and fully diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended September 30, 1996, and $1.1 million, or $0.61 for primary earnings per share  and $0.60 for fully diluted earnings per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 1996.  Expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 included non-recurring expenses of $.7 million related to the completion of the restructuring in June 1996 of PAMM’s predecessor, Presidential Mortgage Company ("Presidential"), and also included management fees payable to the general partner of Presidential of $1.1 million, which have not recurred and will not recur after the restructuring.  Income for the nine  months also included a $.6 million reversal of reserves for loan loss due to the sale of $3.8 million in "piggyback" loans.  These results are not necessarily indicative of results for any other interim period or for the full year.

<P>

	As of October 31, 1996, PAMM has entered into a new loan sale agreement with Aames Capital Corporation ("Aames"), which has been the primary purchaser of PAMM’s loans for over two years.  Under the new agreement, PAMM will receive par value upon sale of the loans, certain premium and advance payments upon securitization of the loans, and further cash payments based upon the "excess spread" on loans sold, to the extent received by Aames as holder of the residual interest in each securitization in which the loans are placed.  Management anticipates that, based upon current assumptions regarding interest rates, prepayment experience and loan performance, the new agreement will result in significantly improved profit margins on all loans sold to Aames.  The new agreement obligates PAMM to sell at least $50 million of loans per quarter until the earlier of October 30, 1998 or a total of $300 million in loans have been sold under the agreement.  The agreement may be terminated  by either PAMM or Aames under certain conditions.  The new agreement will take effect for all loans sold beginning the fourth quarter of 1996.  The statements made in this letter regarding future results of operation under the new Aames agreement are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that future results will meet these expectations.  Actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the amount of loans purchased by Aames, the continuation of the Aames securitization program, interest rates on loans originated by PAMM compared to interest rates required by investors in each securitization and prepayment rates, delinquencies and losses on loans sold by PAMM.

<P>

	PAMM has also signed a letter of intent to sell approximately $23.7 million of mortgage loans secured by commercial property as part of its strategy to exit the commercial loan business and concentrate all of its financial and human resources on residential mortgage lending for securitization.  The loans intended to be sold represent the substantial majority of commercial loans now held in PAMM’s loan portfolio.  If the sale of commercial loans is completed as contemplated under the letter of intent, PAMM expects to realize a significant net gain on the sale.  The completion of the sale is subject to a number of conditions, including the completion of due diligence by the intended purchaser and the completion of a mutually acceptable purchase and sale agreement.  Effective as of October 31, 1996, PAMM has ceased all operations of its commercial property loan division, and has laid off or transferred the 24 employees who worked in that division.  No material charges have been or are expected to be incurred in connection with the discontinuation of operations of the commercial loan division.

<P>

	As of September 30, 1996, PAMM has commenced lending operations in 31 states, and plans to commence operations in 10 additional states by the end of 1996.  Management believes that the volume of loans originated will continue to grow in the fourth quarter of 1996 through 1997, as operations are added in new states and operations recently commenced in other states become better established.  This is a forward looking statement, and there are significant risks that loan originations and sales will not increase as management anticipates due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other lenders, adverse changes in the market for loan securitization products, changes in interest rates, difficulties in management of expansion efforts in one or more states, and other factors.

<P>

	Further information regarding PAMM’s results of operation for the periods ended September 30, 1996 and the new Aames agreement are available in PAMM’s Report on Form 10-Q, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 12, 1996.  A copy of the Report (without exhibits) may be obtained by contacting Mr. Richard B. Fremed, Executive Vice President, (818) 992-8999 extension 250.

<P>

	We appreciate your continuing support.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Shareholder:
<P>

We are pleased to report exciting news on several fronts. Patriot American Hospitality’s performance continues to meet and even exceed our expectations. Our hotel portfolio continues to grow rapidly, driving a large part of our earnings growth. We expect this trend to continue well into 1997.
<P>

Third quarter results. In the third quarter, Patriot American enjoyed continued growth in funds from operations (FFO), revenues and net income, driven both by favorable portfolio performance and a strong acquisition pace. Patriot’s 1996 third quarter FFO, for our existing portfolio, increased 124%, compared to pro forma 1995 third quarter results for our initial 20 hotel portfolio. FFO per share increased 63%, after taking into account the increase in shares outstanding from our $160 million follow-on stock offering in July.
Third quarter property performance. Portfolio operating performance also improved significantly in the 1996 third quarter. Average daily rates (ADR) rose 12% from the third quarter of 1995, to $89.49. Revenue per available room (REVPAR) grew 10.4%, to $64.05. Behind these results is the hard work of our independent lessees and hotel operating companies, as well as Patriot management and staff, who together represent some of the finest talent in the business.
<P>

"Paired share" acquisition. On October 31, we signed a binding agreement to acquire California Jockey Club and Bay Meadows Operating Company, one of the nation’s four "paired-share" REITs. This transaction will require approval by a shareholder vote in early 1997. We will be communicating with you shortly on this acquisition, and welcome your questions any time.

<P>

Acquisitions and renovations. In the third quarter, Patriot expanded its rooms portfolio 36%, acquiring nine hotels, totaling 2,708 guest rooms, for a total investment exceeding $170 million. We also expanded and strengthened important strategic relationships with Doubletree Hotels Corporation, Grand Heritage International and WestCoast Hotels. Renovation continues at the historic Tremont House Hotel in Boston, as well as the Bonaventure Resort & Spa in Fort Lauderdale. Both projects should be completed by mid 1997. These are both outstanding properties in their markets, and our renovation investments should reposition them to be important contributors. Patriot also plans renovations for several hotels acquired late in the third quarter, including the Mayfair Suites in St. Louis and the three hotels acquired in partnership with Doubletree.
<P>

Quarterly dividend increased to 52.5 cents. Patriot’s Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend by 9.4%, to 52.5 cents per share, or $2.10 on an annualized basis. The increased dividend will be paid on January 30, 1997, to shareholders of record on December 26, 1996. The increase both rewards our shareholders for their continuing investment in Patriot American while still allowing us to maintain a conservative dividend payout policy, using internally generated capital to help finance our growth.
<P>

As always, we are deeply appreciative of your investment and your confidence.

<P>

Sincerely, </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Shareholders:

<P>

We are pleased to report double-digit earnings and sales growth for the second quarter of fiscal 1997.  Our second quarter performance was impacted favorably by an 8% increase in consumable sales per customer; resilient equipment sales, which rose 10.4% over the year ago quarter; the expansion of our consumable customer base; and the better-than-expected financial contributions of the Colwell acquisition.
	
<P>
For the three months ended October 26, 1996, net income rose 11.9% to $7.8 million, or 36 cents per share.  Net income available to common shareholders, for the purpose of computing earnings per share, was $7.8 million and $6.8 million, respectively.
	
<P>
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 rose 12.6% to $161.9 million from $143.7 million in the year-ago quarter.  Without the benefit of four weeks of incremental revenues from the Colwell acquisition, the sales increase for the quarter would have been 9.3%.
	
<P>
Sales, excluding Colwell, from U.S. operations increased 10.8% in the second quarter vs. the year-ago period.  Canadian sales fell 4.1% compared with the second quarter last year.  The entire decrease in Canadian sales was attributed to equipment products, which were adversely impacted by increasing competition in the market.  Sales from the Canadian subsidiary comprised 8.5% of total sales.
	
<P>
Excluding Colwell, supplies constituted 62% of sales in the second quarter vs. 62% in the year-ago quarter; equipment represented 28% of sales vs. 27% in the year-ago quarter; and other products and services were 10% of sales vs. 11% in the year-ago quarter.  Equipment sales advanced from their flat levels in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, and were aided by successful new product introductions. Equipment sales benefited from the continued strong demand for the KCP 1000, a cavity preparation device.

<P>

	While gross margin increased during the quarter, operating margin dipped slightly on higher expenses related to the company’s fiscal 1997 first quarter conversion of preferred stock to common stock owned by its Employee Stock Ownership Plan. With the conversion to  common stock, the ESOP will now be funded through a charge to operating expense.  Previously it 
was funded through preferred stock dividends.  The annual charge is estimated to be $800,000.
	
<P>
For the first six months of fiscal 1997, net income rose 5.6% to $14.1 million, or 65 cents per share, from $13.3 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.  Net income available to common shareholders was $14.1 million and $13.0 million, respectively.  Net sales for the fiscal 1997 six months were $304.1 million, up 9.4% compared with $278.0 million in the similar period last year.
	
<P>
At October 26, 1996, the company had 789 sales representatives, up from 741 at October 28, 1995.  The 48 person increase included 46 new U.S. sales associates and two new Canadian representatives.
	
<P>
The truly high point of the quarter was the acquisition of the Colwell division of Deluxe Corporation, which gives us the opportunity to expand our presence to the front office of dental practices and broaden our product offering to our existing customers.  Colwell produces and markets stationery and office supply products to health care providers.  We believe that branching out into this new, yet complementary market will further strengthen our competitive advantage as a one-stop source for meeting practitioners’ needs.
	
<P>
Patterson’s financial position was altered significantly by the acquisition completed during the quarter.  Cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 million at October 26, 1996, down from $42.5 million at July 27, 1996; however, long-term debt levels remain minimal providing us the flexibility to continue our aggressive acquisition strategy.
<P>

	Looking forward, our expansion plans focus primarily on strategic acquisitions offering compelling value.  A second strategy for growth centers on ongoing new product introductions.  At the annual American Dental Association meeting in September, we introduced the Cerec 2, a revolutionary system that allows dentists to offer tooth-conserving dental care in just one patient visit.  Marketing efforts are already underway and initial shipments have begun.
<P>

	As ever, we appreciate your continued interest in the Patterson Dental Company.

<CENTER><B>1996 Third Quarter Results</B></CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>To Our Shareholders</B><BR>
As our financial results indicate, we experienced new highs in third quarter sales and earnings.  We are especially pleased with our 1996 third quarter performance considering our September quarter is typically the slowest period of the year due to the traditional European vacation period.

<P>

<I>Financial Highlights</I><BR>
	Sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 1996 increased 5% to $51.9 million, from $49.3 million for the comparable period of 1995.  Net income jumped 46% to $5.3 million from $3.6 million for the third quarter of 1995.  Earnings per share amounted to $0.19, a 46% improvement over $0.13 for the third quarter in 1995.  The per share earnings have been adjusted to reflect the recent 25% stock dividend paid in September 1996.
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, revenue increased to $162.2 million, up 6% from $152.7 million for the comparable period of 1995.  Net income totaled $15.3 million, a 27% increase over $12.0 million in the first nine months of 1995.  Earnings per share were $0.54 for the 1996 nine-month period, versus $0.43 in 1995.

<P>

<I>Operating Highlights</I><BR>
	Our international business continues to perform well.  Foreign sales surged by 18% and accounted for 39% of 1996 third quarter sales, up from 35% a year ago, reflecting our strategy to build a strong business foundation in international markets.  In September, we announced the appointment of James Wrigley to the post of Chief Executive Officer of our European operations, strengthening our capabilities in that region.  We have now turned our attention to expansion in Asia and Latin America.  Toward this end, we were pleased to announce on October 29, 1996 that Paxar has signed a letter of intent to acquire the Golden-State Group of companies, Asia’s leading producer of label fabrics.
<P>

	Asia has become a principal center of apparel manufacture and thus an especially attractive market for Paxar products.  Initially, we entered Asia in 1991 to serve the Company’s many U.S. customers who source apparel in the Far East.  The acquisition of Golden-State will allow us to begin selling to a large Asian customer base.  In short, Paxar’s extensive product line together with Golden-State’s leading Asian presence and manufacturing capabilities should allow the Company to quickly establish a strong operation in Asia just as we have recently in Europe.
<P>

	In the third quarter, Paxar’s share of Monarch Marking Systems’ after-tax profits was $1.2 million.  Monarch is 49% owned by Paxar, and has added to earnings since its acquisition in 1995.  Monarch’s excellent performance was in line with our plan.  We expect this momentum will continue as Monarch will start shipping in the fourth quarter many of the new products that it has developed and introduced this year.

<P>

<I>Outlook for the Fourth Quarter</I><BR>
	We believe Paxar should finish 1996 with a strong fourth quarter, and are very optimistic about our growth potential as we continue to develop and introduce new products and implement our strategy for global expansion.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>FIRST QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>

<P>


<B>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:</B>

<P>

I am pleased to report that PC Quote had significantly higher revenues for the first quarter of 1996, compared to the year-ago period, increasing 20% to nearly $4 million.

<P>

Operating income for the quarter was $327,148 compared to $320,996.  Earnings per share were $0.042 on 7.3 million average shares outstanding, compared to $0.047 on 7.2 million shares outstanding for the first quarter of 1994.

<P>

These results reflect one of our strongest quarters in revenue growth ever.  As we accomplished this core business growth, we also absorbed some significant expenses related to the first quarter startup of our MarketSmart and QuoteSockets market data services available on the Internet.  A small contribution to revenues from these Internet products was reflected this quarter.  

<P>

Additionally, we are experiencing rapid acceptance among professional investors for PC Quote for Windows 6.0.  This is a product that has provided real-time securities quotations and news to customers’ Local Area Networks (LANs) and personal computers.  Moving forward, every interested investor will be able to access this service at our World-Wide Web site through the Internet, and we anticipate an equally rapid acceptance from our expanded audience.

Looking forward, we expect that another initiative only recently began will also have a favorable effect on our revenue growth for the rest of this year.  On April 17 we made our Web site available to advertisers.  We have upwards of 500,000 visits to our site per day from investors with the type of upscale demographics that advertisers want to reach.  The response to this concept has been stronger than we anticipated, and we are close to completing advertising contracts with several nationally-known companies.

<P>

Dear Shareholder:

<P>

	Third quarter 1996 earnings resulted in net income of $2,311,000 or 37 cents per common share on revenues of $340,670,000, compared with a net loss of $30,674,000 or $6.61 per common share on revenues of $232,974,000 for the third quarter of 1995.

<P>

	For the first nine months of 1996, the company reports net income of $5,822,000 or 88 cents per common share, compared with a net loss of $28,916,000 or $6.58 per common share for the first nine months of 1995.

<P>

	Construction and real estate development revenues totaled $927,191,000 for the first nine months of 1996, compared with $803,024,000 for the first nine months of 1995.  1995 results for both the third quarter and nine month period were significantly affected by a $25.6 million pretax charge taken in connection with a previously disclosed litigation in Washington, D.C. and a revision in estimated probable recoveries on certain outstanding construction claims.

<P>

	No federal income tax was provided for the first nine months of 1996 due to the partial realization of a tax benefit, which resulted from the tax benefit related to losses experienced in 1995 not being fully realized in 1995 because of certain accounting limitations.

<P>

	The backlog of uncompleted construction work at September 30, 1996 was a record $1.746 billion, which represents a 14% increase over 1996's second quarter level and a 12% increase from the $1.559 billion at the same time in 1995.  The company continues to maintain a backlog that reflects a good mix of building and civil construction work.

<P>

Both building and heavy construction operations made significant contributions to third quarter and year to date 1996 results in contrast to the significant loss experienced in the third quarter of 1995.  The company's improved performance included the favorable impact of several large infrastructure projects underway in late 1995, primarily in the Boston, New York and Los Angeles areas.  As in third quarter 1995, real estate operations showed a small loss in 1996.

<P>

	On November 11, 1996, the company announced that it had arranged for $10 million of additional short-term financing through an increase in the company's available bank credit facility.  The financing became available through a participation under the existing loan by a group of investors led by Richard C. Blum & Associates, L.P. of San Francisco.  The financing will be repayable by the company at the earlier of the completion of the proposed $30 million issuance of a new series of cumulative convertible junior preferred stock to the Blum group or January 31, 1997.  As a fee for the financing, the company has issued shares of Perini Corporation common stock having a fair market value of $400,000 to the Blum group.

<P>

	As previously announced in July 1996, the company has entered into an agreement with an investor group led by Richard C. Blum & Associates, L.P. of San Francisco, for a $30 million investment in the form of a new issuance of 150,150 shares of cumulative convertible junior preferred stock in the company.  The Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on November 27, 1996, as the record date for the determination of shareholders of the corporation entitled to vote on this proposal.   It is now expected that the closing of the transaction will take place in January of next year at a Special Meeting of the shareholders of the corporation, instead of fourth quarter 1996 as originally announced.  Notification of the Special Meeting will be forthcoming.

<P>

Sincerely,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><P>
<B>TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS</B>

<P>

	We are pleased to announce that on September 17, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a $.0375 per share quarterly dividend on our Common Stock to stockholders of record on November 20, 1996.

<P>

	The operating results for the third quarter and nine months ended October 27, 1996 are indicated in the table in this report.

<P>

	Net sales were $391.2 million for the third quarter compared with $448.0 million in the prior year, a decrease of 12.7%.  In the nine months, sales decreased 9.4% to $978.7 million from $1,080.5 million in the prior year. This decrease was expected, given the absence of clearance sales associated with the acquisition of Crystal Brands, the planned elimination of the Company’s private label retail formats, the planned reduction of low margin private label sales at the wholesale level and the closure of factory outlet stores as part of the Company’s continuing strategic initiative to downsize its factory outlet business.  The effect of these changes more than offset sales gains made this year in the Company’s branded product lines at the wholesale level.

<P>

	Gross profit on sales for the third quarter and nine months was 33.2% and 33.5%, respectively, as compared to last year’s 31.0% and 33.0% for the same periods. The improvement in gross profit comes largely from the elimination of certain of the less profitable businesses described above.  In addition, a better tone to overall business allowed for a significant reduction of promotional selling, especially in footwear which enjoyed a strong back to school season.

<P>

	Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the third quarter and nine months was 26.3% and 30.2%, respectively, compared to last year’s 26.1% and 29.8% for the same periods.

<P>

	Interest expense, net, for the third quarter and nine months was $6.0 million and $18.0 million, respectively, as compared to $6.6 million and $17.3 million for the comparable periods last year. The interest increase for the nine months is directly related to the timing of the Gant and Izod acquisition and the funding of the cash portion of the Company’s prior year $27.0 million restructuring initiatives.  Current year cash flow should continue to improve and positively impact this comparison for the balance of the year.

<P>

	Income tax expense was estimated at a rate of 28.2% and 27.2% for the third quarter and nine months compared with last year’s rates of 27.4% and 28.3%, (before the effect of the non-recurring restructuring charge), respectively.  Both the 1995 and 1996 tax rates reflect the relationship of U.S. income taxed at normal rates versus tax exempted income from operations in Puerto Rico.

<P>

	Net income for the third quarter and nine months was $15.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively, as compared to $11.4 million and $11.9 million for the comparable periods last year.  The prior year’s net income amounts exclude $25.0 million of non-recurring plant and store closing charges.  Net income in the third quarter improved, before the non-recurring charges, due to stronger gross margins in both footwear and apparel.  This was partially offset by current year start-up costs associated with the new Gant and Izod outlet stores and the absence of last year’s successful clearance activity which negatively impacted the apparel segment.  During the nine months, stronger gross margins were more than offset by the start-up costs and the absence of clearance activity.  Earnings per share for the third quarter and nine months were $.56 and $.39 compared with last year’s pre-restructuring amounts of $.43 and $.45, respectively.

<P>

	We are in the early stages of financial turn-around.  Much of our past year’s initiatives are just beginning to bear fruit.  For example Izod, for Spring ‘97 has sold into 1,600 doors compared to 1,200 in the comparable period in ‘96.  Gant has upgraded its product offering, taken over the direct sourcing and marketing of its outerwear (from a licensee) and added some 130 in-store shops.  And Bass has opened two Lifestyle Concept stores which have been of enormous value in lending focus to the development of Bass as a lifestyle brand.  This in turn has provided a strong assist to the expansion of Bass’ wholesale footwear business.

<P>

	These beginnings will require a significant future investment in infrastructure and marketing to maximize our sell-throughs and build on what we’ve achieved to date.  Still, our third quarter EBIT improvement of 20%, coupled with gross margin improvement of 2.2 percentage points, provide solid evidence that today’s initiatives are beginning to take hold.  We feel more than ever that we are on the right track to accomplish what we’ve set out to do - build our brand franchises and maximize the opportunities that they present.

<blockquote>Dear Shareholder:
<P>
Successful growth strategies and healthy semiconductor design activity once again allow us to report record sales and strong earnings.  Our ability to orchestrate a program of global expansion is driven by integrated circuit design activity and the implementation of advanced integrated circuit production technology, neither of which are directly related to integrated circuit sales.  
<P>
The demand for advanced photomask manufacturing technology and capacity creates growth opportunities for Photronics worldwide.  Acquisitions in Europe and investments in the Asia-Pacific region have been strategically important in building upon our leading North American market share position.  We are excited about the growth we see in both Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions and feel that our presence there will significantly complement our strong position in North America.
<P>
Highlights from our third quarter include:

<UL>
<LI>Record sales of $42.7 million, a 30% increase over the year-ago period. 
<LI>Net income of $5.5 million, or $0.46 per share, a 23% increase over the prior year period, before non-recurring items.   
<LI>Guaranteed manufacturing capacity agreement signed with National Semiconductor. 
<LI>Announced plans to build a manufacturing facility in the Austin, Texas area. 
<LI>Beta Squared, a subsidiary, was recognized by Research and Development Magazine with an R&D 100 Award for advances in particle contamination technology.
</UL><P>
	Our competitive strengths serve us well as we continue to  expand internationally.  Driven by our unparalleled investments, we have established Photronics as a leading photomask supplier in each of the strategically important markets we serve.  Our new operations in Europe continue adding to sales and earnings.  More importantly, they allow us to penetrate this market from a position previously unavailable because we lacked a local manufacturing presence.   The outlook in the Asia-Pacific region is even brighter because of its size and rapid growth rate.  Our investment in Korea and our newly opened facility in Singapore have given us an excellent platform to increase regional customer support. 
<P>
 
Our evaluation of the semiconductor industry’s demand for photomask manufacturing technology and capacity is continuous.  Our close dialogue with semiconductor manufacturers, enables us to continually fine tune our growth strategies.  In addition, these discussions have served to elevate the importance of having a cost-effective photomask supply, paving the way for innovative capacity and supply agreements.  Several such agreements are in place with existing customers and we believe partnering of this kind will continue in the future.

<P>
First and foremost, we remain focused on our responsibility to our customers and accountability to our shareholders.  Being responsible to our customers means that we continue to be a source of innovative solutions to the challenges they face.  Accountability to the shareholders means that we always seek to maximize the return on assets they have entrusted to us.  Responsibility and accountability together have steadily brought us to the leadership position we occupy today, and upon which we will build in the future.

<P>
Third quarter net revenues were $9.5 million, an increase of 50% compared to net revenues of $6.3 million recorded for the third quarter of 1995.  Net income in the third quarter was $0.4 million, or 2 cents per share compared to a net loss of $0.4 million, or a 10 cent net loss per share for the third quarter of 1995.
	
<P>
For the nine months ended September 29, 1996, the Company reported net revenues of $27.0 million, an increase of 58% compared to net revenues of $17.0 million recorded for the nine months ended October 1, 1995.  Net income for the nine months ended September 29, 1996 was $0.9 million, or 5 cents per share compared to a net loss of $1.7 million, or a 39 cent net loss per share for the same period last year.
	
<P>
"We are pleased to have maintained operating profitability during the quarter in which we have prepared for the significant expansion of our audioconferencing product line," said Brian Hinman, president and chief executive officer.  "Polycom’s audioconferencing business continued to gain strength through continued SoundStation deployment in the third quarter while the Company focused on the launch of its new SoundPoint desktop product and its new SoundStation Premier conference room product."

Polycom is now positioned to maintain its significant leadership through a full range of audioconferencing requirements, from the desktop to the largest conference rooms."
	
<P>
Hinman continued, "The dataconferencing business also experienced success in the third quarter with incremental orders from key customers and a new software release for the ShowStation product.  This business segment is gaining strength through the evolution of the T.120 conferencing environment and through our focus on vertical markets such as project management and federal government applications.  These ShowStation successes to date have primarily been through Polycom’s direct sales efforts and through the direct sales efforts of our OEM partner."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To our shareholders:

<P>

	Third quarter earnings were $1,137,000, or $.08 per share, compared to a loss of $6,645,000, or $(.49) per share, in the third quarter of 1995 and second quarter 1996 earnings of $662,000, or $.05 per share.  Lower pulp and chip prices and the closure of the Port Gamble sawmill in late 1995 caused revenues to decline 15 percent to $112,366,000 in the third quarter of 1996 from third quarter 1995 levels.

<P>

	Pope & Talbot earned $2,144,000, or $.16 per share, in the first nine months of 1996 compared with a loss of $16,890,000, or $(1.26) per share, for the first nine months of 1995.  Revenues in the first nine months of $333,615,000 were 14 percent lower than in 1995.  

<P>

	Lumber continued to perform very well during the quarter as 
mortgage rates remained stable, housing starts were better than expected 
and lumber prices surpassed already strong second quarter levels.  Wood 
products earnings would have been higher except for low residual wood 
chip prices which remain depressed in line with lower pulp prices.  Although we have seen some lumber price declines recently, these reductions are from high price levels and we are optimistic that lumber will continue to perform well at least for the remainder of the year.

<P>

	Our pulp business, as well as most of the pulp industry, continues to suffer from inadequate product pricing as the industry works through high inventory levels brought on by new capacity additions last year.  Pulp posted a loss for the quarter as our pulp prices are down substantially from this time last year.  It is encouraging that prices have been moving upward, although slowly, since the lows felt in the second quarter of this year.  Pulp continues to be helped by lower wood chip costs, however, lower chip prices are detrimental on a company-wide basis as we sell slightly more chips from our sawmills than we consume in the pulp operations.

<P>

	Tissue has made a substantial turnaround since last year and was again profitable in the quarter.  We have made a considerable effort rebuilding our customer base since the strike at Ransom was settled late last year and are pleased that this process is essentially complete and we are now operating at capacity.  Tissue prices were highest at the beginning of the year and have declined during the year in line with price reductions implemented by Procter & Gamble and Kimberly Clark.  Although profit margins are not yet at an acceptable level, we are encouraged that high operating rates in the industry should help maintain pricing and provide a stable environment where we can improve the profitability of this business.

<P>

	Pope & Talbot is in a much improved position from where we were at this time last year.  Lumber is performing much better than a year ago and although some prices appear to be declining, they are still ahead of last year.  Tissue is now profitable, in part because of the settlement of the strike at Ransom late last year, but also because of better raw material and product prices and, with the new labor contract, lower labor costs at Ransom.  Pulp prices appear to be improving which should reduce pulp losses that have hampered earnings all year.  Finally, we have disposed of the diaper business and the Port Gamble sawmill, both of which were a substantial drain on earnings last year.

<P>

	The Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.19 per share payable on November 15, 1996 to shareholders of record 
<P>

November 4, 1996.

ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 1996 RESULTS</B></CENTER>


<P>


SAN DIEGO, California, October 10/PRNewswire/ -- Price Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:PREN) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

The Company's net loss for the fourth quarter was $6.6 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to a loss of $2.4 million, or $0.10 per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1995.  For the full year, the net income was $90,000, or $0.00 per share, compared to $546,000, or $0.02 per share, in fiscal year 1995.  

<P>

As previously announced on August 6, 1996, the Company recorded a $16 million pretax impairment loss reserve during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996.  This noncash charge reduced reported earnings by $9.4 million, or $0.41 per share, and was taken to facilitate the sale of properties held for sale during the coming year.  Excluding impairment loss reserves and gains (losses) on property sales, pretax earnings from the Company's real estate segment rose from $23.3 million to $26.1 million, an increase of 12%.

<P>

Real estate operations generated $8.6 million of adjusted funds from operations (FFO) during the fourth quarter, as compared to $8.2 million during the comparable period last year, an increase of 5.3%.  During fiscal year 1996, adjusted FFO has risen 9.2% from $30.2 million to $33.0 million due in large part to income from the Company's Pentagon City, Virginia shopping center which was completed during Fall 1994.  Adjusted FFO represents pretax earnings from the real estate segment, excluding gains (losses) from the sales of properties and provisions for asset impairments, after adding back depreciation and eliminating straight-line rent accruals.

<P>

Sales from the Company's merchandising businesses during the fourth quarter declined from $11.3 million last year to $6.6 million in fiscal 1996.  Price Quest electronic merchandising sales during the fourth quarter were significantly less than a year ago primarily due to the elimination of merchandise displays at PriceCostco locations.  Kiosk operations in PriceCostco warehouses were discontinued on September 1, 1996.  In addition, Price Global Trading continued to experience lower sales due to the discontinuance of export sales.  Pretax losses from the merchandising businesses during the fourth quarter decreased from $4.5 million last year to $2.4 million in fiscal 1996.  This decrease in pretax losses is primarily due to reduced operating expenses at Price Quest as well as license fee income recorded in fourth quarter from Price Venture's licensees in China and Indonesia, for which no comparable amount was recorded in the prior year.

<P>

Merchandising sales for fiscal 1996 decreased 46% from $66.6 million in fiscal year 1995 to $36.2 million in fiscal year 1996.  Losses for the merchandising segment for the fiscal year decreased from $15.4 million last year ($11.9 million on an after-tax basis) to $11.4 million in fiscal 1996 ($7.5 million on an after-tax basis).  Losses during the prior year included losses related to the Company's interest in Price Club Mexico (PCM) which was sold in April 1995.

<P>

As announced in a press release on July 26, 1996, a tentative settlement has been reached in the pending shareholder litigation which provides, among other things, that PEI would relinquish certain rights and would become sole owner of both Price Quest and Price Global Trading.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  The Company accrued $1.25 million of settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 pursuant to terms of the tentative agreement.

<P>

Price Enterprises is a diversified company whose primary asset is a significant portfolio of unencumbered commercial real estate.  In addition to its real estate and related assets, the Company currently owns a 51% interest in Price Quest, a 51% interest in Price Global Trading, and a 100% interest in Price Ventures, a company which is pursuing new merchandising businesses.</BLOCKQUOTE>

THE PRICE REIT, INC. ANNOUNCES<BR>
      RECORD RESULTS AND 8%<BR>
   INCREASE IN FFO PER SHARE</B></CENTER><P>


	The Price REIT, Inc. (NYSE: "RET") announced its operating results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1996.  Total revenues for the third quarter 1996 increased 26% to $13.4 million compared with total revenues of $10.6 million in the third quarter 1995.  Funds from operations for the third quarter increased approximately $696,000 to $7.3 million compared with $6.6 million last year.  This amounted to $0.86 per share for the current quarter, up approximately 8% compared with $0.80 per share for the third quarter last year.  Net income for the current quarter was $4.1 million, approximately the same as the comparable quarter last year.  Net income per share was $0.48 and $0.49 for the respective quarters.  The per share amounts were based on average shares outstanding for the respective quarters of 8,505,000 and 8,282,000.
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, total revenues increased 26% to $39.7 million compared with total revenues of $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1995.  Funds from operations increased to $21.6 million or $2.58 per share, up approximately 8% compared with $19.6 million or $2.38 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 1995.  Net income for the current nine months was $12.3 million compared with net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1995, of $12.2 million.  Net income per share was $1.47 and $1.48 for the nine-month periods respectively.  The per share amounts were based on average shares  outstanding for the respective nine-month periods of 8,392,000 and 8,248,000.
<P>

	The increase in total revenues and funds from operations for the recent quarter and the nine-month period can be attributed mainly to the acquisition of new properties.  In the past twelve months, the Company has acquired six new properties.  These include the acquisition of power and community centers in Webster (Houston), Texas; La Mirada, California; Oxnard, California; and Mesquite (Dallas), Texas; and the acquisition of two shopping centers located in Glendale and Phoenix, Arizona in which the Company has a 50% ownership interest through joint ventures.  The full impact of these acquisitions should be realized next year.  Currently the Company has several additional properties in escrow subject to review, which are being considered for immediate acquisition.  As previously noted, the Company continues to expand and develop certain of its existing properties and recently started a major new development in Smithtown (Commack), New York.  It is anticipated that all of the foregoing will have a continuing positive impact on financial results.
<P>

	In preparation for continuing growth and expansion, the Company recently raised capital through issuance of new stock and debt securities.  In September the Company sold 690,000 shares of common stock at $32.125 per share and in November, after the close of the third quarter, the Company sold a $55 million issue of 10-year 7.50% Senior Notes.  These financing activities netted a total of approximately $75 million.  The funds were used to pay down the Company's variable interest rate credit line and for expansion of properties.  While the issuance of the new stock and debt at a slightly higher rate of interest over current short term debt at variable interest rates may have a temporary minor dilutive effect on Funds from Operations per share, it limits exposure to variable interest rate risk and builds a solid financial base for the Company's expansion program.  The current financial structure will enable the Company to sustain its growth pattern in the near future.  
<P>

	The statements in this release in the two preceding paragraphs that relate to future plans, events or performance are forward-looking statements.  Actual results might differ materially due to a variety of factors, including, without  limitation a downturn or lack of growth of the local economies or the retail industry in the markets in which the Company operates.  Additional information about these factors is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's most recently filed Report on Form 10-Q under the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."     </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<CENTER><B>PRIMESOURCE CORPORATION REPORTS HIGHER THIRD QUARTER RESULTS<P>
DECLARES  QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF 4.5¢</B></CENTER>

<P>

PENNSAUKEN, NJ (October 28, 1996) - PrimeSource Corporation (Nasdaq/NM:PSRC) today announced results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1996.  For the third quarter, PrimeSource reported higher net sales of $89,344,000 compared with $88,156,000 in the prior-year period.  Net income was $924,000, or $.14 per share, a twofold increase over net income of $451,000, or $.07 per share, in the year-earlier period. Revenues for the first nine months of 1996 were $264,201,000 compared with $266,891,000 in 1995.  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996, was $2,669,000, or $.41 per share, up sharply over net income of $792,000, or $.12 per share, for the year-to-date period in 1995.  Net income for the nine-month period in 1995 included a one-time, after-tax charge of $794,000, or $.12 per share, related to a restructuring plan initiated in the second quarter of 1995. 

<P>

PrimeSource also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 4.5 cents per share payable on December 2, 1996, to shareholders of record on November 15, 1996. 

<P>

Commenting on the announcements,  James F. Mullan, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Our third quarter results reflected continued improvement in our operating results due to stronger sales, continued efficient operations and improved asset utilization.  During the quarter, we announced an agreement to purchase VGC Corp.'s branch locations in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Des Moines, and Omaha. VGC Corp. is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of NV Koninklijke KNP BT, a publicly held Dutch paper,  packaging and distribution company.  We expect to complete the transaction by November 1, 1996.  This acquisition will generate in excess of $60 million."

<P>

Mullan continued, "Our strategy is to provide our customers with a total-solution approach to their needs by adding value to the products and systems we distribute. We will use our financial strength and national market coverage to continue to make acquisitions that complement and leverage our existing operations."

<P>

PrimeSource Corporation is a national distributor and systems integrator serving the printing, publishing and graphic arts industries.  The Company has 30 locations throughout the United States.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dear Stockholder:

<P>

    Significant achievements in the second quarter of 1996 included the grant of a U.S. patent to PDL for Zenapax® (SMART™ Anti-Tac, dacliximab) and humanization of a mouse antibody for a pharmaceutical partner.  Hoffmann-La Roche’s two Phase III studies of Zenapax to prevent graft rejection in kidney transplant patients have been completed, and the data unblinding and analysis and the release of results are expected by the end of October.

<P>

    The U.S. patent for Zenapax follows the issuance in January of a European patent that covers all PDL humanized antibodies as well as most humanized antibodies created by other companies or academic researchers.  PDL’s technical leadership in antibody humanization and strong patent position are highly valuable assets not only for PDL’s own product pipeline, but also in putting the Company in an advantageous position to humanize antibodies for other pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms.

<P>

    After the second quarter, changes were announced in trials of the PROTOVIR™ human antibody in people with AIDS who have cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.  On August 14, PDL received notice of and announced the decision of the Studies of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (SOCA) clinical research group to stop enrollment and treatment in the Phase II/III trial it was conducting.  The action followed an interim analysis that did not show intravenous PROTOVIR to be effective as a supplemental treatment to primary therapy in delaying the progression of CMV retinitis.

<P>
	
    SOCA also found that patients with relapsed retinitis (those who had previously failed primary therapy for CMV retinitis) who were treated with PROTOVIR had a higher mortality rate than relapsed patients who received only primary therapy.  No such difference was observed in patients with first episodes of retinitis.  SOCA said the meaning of the difference in the relapsed sub group was "unclear" and noted that the mortality rate in relapsed patients on placebo was lower than expected from prior studies.

<P>

    On September 3, the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocol team responsible for the current Phase II study of intravenous PROTOVIR in combination with primary therapy in CMV retinitis temporarily closed the trial to new patients and recommended that the study resume enrollment using a higher dose level of PROTOVIR than has been used in the ACTG or SOCA studies. The ACTG trial has enrolled only patients with first episodes of CMV retinitis. Timely resumption of the trial using a higher dose cannot be guaranteed and will require approval by the ACTG, the FDA, and the participating medical centers.

<P>

    PDL’s third trial in CMV disease, a Phase II study for prevention of CMV infections in cancer patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation 

<P>

(BMT), is continuing unchanged following a review in late August of safety data by the study’s independent data safety monitoring board.  The trial is nearly fully enrolled and may be completed approximately at year-end.  Data is expected to be available in the first half of 1997.

<P>

    Financial results for the second quarter were issued on August 13 and appear below.  Revenues were $5.0 million compared to revenues of $4.1 million for the comparable period in 1995.  The Company incurred a net loss of $3.5 million, or 22 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million, or 16 cents per share, for the second quarter of 1995.  PDL’s cash position is $102.7 million as of June 30.

<P>

    Research and development revenues increased to $3.5 million in the second quarter of 1996 from $2.5 million in the year-earlier quarter.  The increase was due to a higher level of revenues earned under the Company’s agreement with Boehringer Mannheim GmbH and a milestone payment from a pharmaceutical partner.  Revenues under funded research programs with Boehringer Mannheim will remain unchanged at $3.0 million in the third quarter but will decline as scheduled to $1.0 million in the fourth quarter when that funding arrangement expires.

<P>
		
    Total costs and expenses for the quarter rose to $8.5 million from $6.5 million in the comparable period in 1995.  Research and development expenses in the quarter were $7.2 million, compared to $5.3 million in the year-earlier period.  This increase was principally due to a higher level of expenses associated with ongoing clinical trials, a higher level of operations in the manufacturing and development groups, and the addition of staff.   

<P>

    Important upcoming events include results of the Phase III studies of Zenapax and the expected commencement by Boehringer Mannheim of Phase II and Phase II/III studies of PDL’s Human Anti-Hepatitis B Antibody. There are an estimated one million chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus in the United States and 300 million worldwide, and approximately 25% of these carriers develop chronic liver disease.  Advancement of PDL’s anti-hepatitis B product into large trials to assess safety and efficacy will be a significant milestone, and study  details will be released once they are under way.
 
<P>


Sincerely yours,

<P>

<B><CENTER>FISCAL 1996<BR>
THIRD QUARTER REPORT</CENTER>
<P>


TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
</B>
<P>

	As Proteon ended its third fiscal quarter on September 28, 1996, the company continued to execute two important business initiatives: transitioning its revenue streams from legacy products to Remote Access Routing products and establishing itself as one of the leading providers of shared access devices for Internet and Intranet connectivity.
	
<P>
For the third quarter, Proteon reported a net loss of $1,763,000, or $0.11 per share, compared with net income of $1,558,000, or $0.10 per share, for the comparable period of 1995.  Net sales for the third quarter of 1996 were $10,589,000, compared with $16,440,000 for the third quarter of 1995.
	
<P>
Although the company did not make a profit in this period, I am happy to report that unit shipments of our GlobeTrotter Internet Access Routers increased approximately 150 percent versus 50 percent in the previous quarter, and the overall Remote Access unit shipments grew by 55 percent versus 20 percent in the second quarter.  These impressive increases exceeded our internal sales objectives by a large percentage.

<P>

The company also intensified its outbound marketing campaigns, while continuing to win critical acclaim for the new Remote Access products that we believe are shaping our future.  At the Networld+Interop show, Proteon rolled out the GTSecure product line, the first router that also serves as a network firewall.  Also noteworthy, IBM's Multiprotocol Switched Services Server, which runs Proteon's OpenROUTE internetworking software, won the Grand Prize for Best of Show.
	
<P>
Dataquest, Inc., one of the industry's premiere market research firms, has recognized Proteon as having a fifth place market share for overall internetworking products.  We believe that when OpenROUTE shipments of our licensees are considered, Proteon enjoys a 12 percent market share and is ranked third behind only Cisco and Bay Networks.  Dataquest also released a new market share analysis that named Proteon a 13 percent player in the personal router market.  This market share is due in part to shipments of products by IBM for which the company enjoys a royalty payment for the OpenROUTE software installed.
	
<P>
During the period, Proteon also made Network World magazine's "short list" recommendation for low priced remote access routers.  The short list recommendation is used by decision makers to establish finalists in any procurement process.  The company also participated in an ISDN product benchmark test conducted by Strategic Networks Consulting, Inc.  The GlobeTrotter 70 was named the fastest ISDN router in two categories: fastest throughput of compressed data over two B channels and fastest call setup time.  We also received a first place mention for ease of use and installation.

<P>

We formed a number of new Internet Service Provider relationships, including one with NETCom and Ingram Micro. In addition, we signed up 23 new Value Added Resellers (VARs) who focus on wide area networking.  Also, Racal Datacom has begun to re-sell our entire GlobeTrotter product line and Digital Equipment launched its RouteAbout Access product which is built by Proteon as part of an OEM relationship.
<P>

	We are continuing to enhance market credibility and customer visibility, to introduce new Internet and Intranet access products, and to expand our channels of distribution to reach the emerging SOHO and Remote Branch market.  I look forward to updating you in our annual report which will be forthcoming in the new year.  Thank you for your continued support of Proteon.

<UL>
<LI>Net revenues increased 21.6% to $51.7 million from
$42.5 million.  Revenue growth was particularly
	strong in Portland, Charlotte, Boise and Honolulu.  
        Summer Olympics contributed over $4 million in 
        incremental revenue.   
<LI>Broadcasting EBITDA (earnings before interest,
	taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock based
	compensation and pension) improved 48.7%
	to $19.0 million from $12.8 million.  (See
	EBITDA table below).
<LI>Operating expenses were $32.6 million, up 9.9% from same period last year.  The increase was driven by over $1 million of one time costs associated with the coverage and promotion of the Summer Olympics.  Contributing to increased expense were sports related costs in Seattle and Tucson and the incremental start-up news costs and promotional expenses associated with the affiliation switch from Fox to NBC on January 1, 1996, at KHNL-TV in Honolulu.

<LI>Advertising revenues increased 5.8% to $22.9 million in the third quarter from $21.6 million for the comparable quarter last year in part due to improved economic conditions in Rhode Island.  Circulation revenues rose 5.1% to $8.5 million from $8.1 million in 1995 for the comparable quarter as price increases more than offset lower circulation.
<LI>EBITDA in Publishing, excluding restructuring charges, increased by 168.2% for the third quarter of 1996 to $6.6 million. 
<LI>Operating expenses decreased by 9.6% or $2.7 million primarily as a result of reduced payroll and favorable newsprint pricing. 
<LI>Newsprint expense was down 20.7%, or $1.1 million, from the same quarter last year.
Average circulation (3 months):<BR>

<U><B>PROGRAMMING AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA-</B></U><BR>
<LI>The Company made cash investments in its Programming and Electronic Media ("PEM") segment during the third quarter of 1996, totaling $4.4 million, including $3.2 million in Television Food Network ("TVFN").   As of September 30, 1996, the Company has invested a total of $106.6 in its PEM investments including $47.9 million in TVFN and $35.3 million in American’s Health Network ("AHN").   The Company has a 65% interest in AHN and controls TVFN.  Both of these investments are consolidated (AHN since January 1, 1996 and TVFN since May 1, 1996).
<LI>The PEM segment revenues increased by $3.8 million to $4.6 million from $0.8 million last year primarily due to the consolidation of TVFN. 
<LI>Operating expenses of $15.8 million in the PEM segment are driven by the consolidation of Television Food Network and start-up costs at NorthWest Cable News and America’s Health Network.

<LI>On September 26, 1996 the Company signed a definitive agreement to merge with the A.H. Belo Corporation (NYSE:BLC) of Dallas, TX.  The exchange ratio in the transaction is .5333 shares of Belo stock plus $12.33 for every share of The Providence Journal Company stock.

<CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER REPORT SEPTEMBER 30, 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

PS Group Holdings, Inc. (PSGH) reported unaudited net income for the third quarter of 1996 of $1,048,000 - $.17 per share - compared to net income of $1,241,000 - $.20 per share - in the third quarter of 1995.  Third quarter 1996 compared to second quarter 1996 results were depressed by lower margins from falling fuel prices during July and August from the fuel distribution operation compared to the higher margins from increasing fuel prices in the second quarter of 1996.  Higher crude oil prices in the oil production and development operation partially offset the negative results from fuel distribution.   PSGH results for the first nine months of 1996 were net income (unaudited) of $3,486,000 - $.57 per share - compared to net income of $2,125,000 - $.35 per share - for the first nine months of 1995.  For the first nine months of 1996, the benefit of the higher margins from increasing fuel prices in the second quarter more than offset the negative effect of lower margins from falling fuel prices in the third quarter.  1996 nine month results also benefitted from higher crude oil prices compared to 1995.   Both 1996 and 1995 results included unusual items.  1996 results include after-tax charges of $855,000 - $(.14) per share - resulting from the combined total of expenses at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) primarily for the permanent removal of fuel distribution pipelines as a result of  airport construction, fees and expenses for the holding company reorganization which was approved by shareholders on June 5, 1996 and write-downs of U.S. Government securities due to higher interest rates.  Partially offsetting these charges in the first nine months of 1996 was additional after-tax income of $200,000 - $.03 per share - from the settlement of Pan Am's bankruptcy and 747 engine parts sales related to the two aircraft sold in 1995.  1995 results included an after-tax loss of $1,106,000 - $(.18) per share - from the sale of two 747-100SF aircraft.  The $77 million increase in consolidated revenues in the first nine months of 1996 ($199 million) versus 1995 ($122 million) resulted primarily from higher fuel volumes and overall higher fuel prices by the wholesale fuel division of PSGH's fuel distribution subsidiary, PS Trading, Inc. (PST).  Despite the SFO expenses previously mentioned, PST's net income in the first nine months of 1996 was almost double PST's 1995 results.  PS Group, Inc.,  PSGH's aircraft leasing subsidiary, recorded slightly lower net income in 1996 compared to 1995 after adjusting for the 1996 holding company reorganization expenses and 1995 loss on the sale of the 747's.  Statex Petroleum, Inc., PSGH's oil and gas production and development subsidiary, recorded net income in 1996 more than double the level of 1995, principally as a result of higher crude oil prices.

<P>

<U>Update on BAe 146-200 Aircraft</U>  - During 1996, USAir has made additional progress in subleasing some of the ten BAe 146-200 aircraft which are leased from PSG and have been in storage for several years while USAir has continued to make the lease payments to PSG.  As of September 30, 1996, USAir has subleased and delivered six of PSG's ten BAe 146 aircraft to one U.S. and  two European regional  airlines.  In addition, USAir has indicated they have reached final agreement to sublease one more of PSG's BAe 146 aircraft to a U.S. regional airline in November 1996 and preliminary agreement to sublease the remaining three of PSG's BAe 146's to two European regional airlines with delivery by the end of the first quarter of 1997.  PSGH believes that both the value of the BAe 146's and the prospects for potentially releasing or selling the BAe 146's at the end of the USAir lease term in the fall of 2000 are enhanced if the aircraft are in operation prior to lease expiration.

<P>

<U>PSGH Common Stock Transfer Restrictions</U> - Effective with the holding company reorganization on June 5, 1996, certain restrictions were imposed on the transfer of common shares of PSGH.  In general, and subject to an exemption for certain dispositions of shares by persons who were "pre-existing 5% shareholders" on June 5, 1996 as defined in Article XI of PSGH's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the transfer restrictions prohibit, without prior approval of the Board of Directors, the direct or indirect disposition or acquisition of any stock of PSGH by or to any holder who owns, or would, as a result thereof, own (either directly or through the tax attribution rules) 5% or more of the stock upon such acquisition.  These restrictions have been imposed in order to help preserve PSGH's substantial net operating and investment tax credit carryforwards and other tax benefits by decreasing the risk of an "ownership change" for federal income tax purposes.

<P>

<U>1995 Special Distribution</U> - In January 1996, PSG stockholders received a special distribution of $1.50 per share which was mailed to stockholders December 30, 1995.  At the time of distribution, PSG indicated that, subject to completion of the complex calculations related to filing PSG's 1995 tax return, it believed that all or part of the distribution constituted a return of capital and would not be taxable as a dividend.  The calculations have now been completed and filed as part of PSG's 1995 federal tax return.  The calculations indicate that all of the distribution was a return of capital and, as such, first will be applied against and reduce each stockholder's basis in the stock, and second, to the extent the distribution exceeds a stockholder's basis in the stock, will generally result in a capital gain.  As with all other tax matters, these calculations are subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service.  The 1996 Form 1099 advising recipients of this treatment will be mailed in January 1997.<P>

<B>Second Quarter Report 1996
<P>

To Our Shareholders:</B>
<P>

I am pleased to report that Pure Software Inc. announced 
record financial results for the second quarter ended 
June 30, 1996.  Revenues in the second quarter ended 
June 30, 1996 were $16.5 million, up 60% from revenues 
of $10.3 million in the second quarter a year ago.  Earnings per 
share in the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 were $.11, 
up 120% from pro forma earnings per share of $.05 in the 
second quarter a year ago. 
<P>

The past quarter has been an exciting and successful one for Pure Software and our customers.  During the quarter, we shipped our industry-leading error location product, Purify, for the Windows NT platform.  We believe Purify will significantly increase both the productivity of Windows NT developers and the level of quality of the software they create.
<P>

In June of 1996, Pure Software announced a definitive agreement to merge with Atria Software, a leader in software configuration management.  The merger, which was unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company, is expected to close in the third quarter of 1996, subject to customary conditions for closure, including shareholder approval.  By merging with Atria, we become the worldwide leader in software development and quality management.  In the past, we’ve worked closely with Atria to provide our customers with solutions for increasing software quality while reducing time-to-market.  As one company with an integrated product line, we can offer a complete development and quality management solution to organizations building reliable, sophisticated software.
<P>

Pure Software, with more than 4,000 corporate customers, is the world leader in Automated Software Quality (ASQ) tools that improve the reliability, scalability and performance of Windows, UNIX and Web applications.  We are the only ASQ company that addresses the entire software lifecycle of development, testing and deployment.  Based in Sunnyvale, California, Pure Software posted revenues of $44 million for 1995, a 100 percent increase over 1994 revenues.  Our shares are traded under Nasdaq:  PRSW.  More information on Pure Software is available on the Internet at <A HREF="http://www.pure.com">www.pure.com</A>.
<P>

The forward looking statements contained in this report, which reflect management’s best judgment based on factors currently known, involve risks and uncertainties, including the potential for fluctuations in quarterly operating results, the successful development and market acceptance of new products, the successful integration of Pure Software and Atria Software, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s SEC reports, including the Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.  Actual results may vary materially.

<P>

Sincerely,
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To our Shareholders:

<P>

I am pleased to report that PureTec Corporation is making excellent progress in our efforts to transform our solid operations into equally solid financial results.  We have posted our first profitable quarter since our merger on July 31, 1995, and are beginning to see concrete proof of the financial strength and potential earnings power of the new PureTec.

<P>

Our financial performance has improved dramatically over the comparable period last year. The financial summary below shows comparisons to 1995 results as reported by the former Pure Tech International, as well as an estimate of what financial results would have been if the merger had been in place last year  ("pro forma").   In summary, for the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, 1996, PureTec reported net income of $5.2 million, or 19 cents per share, which is more than double the pro forma net income from continuing operations in the 1995 period of $2.2 million, or 9 cents per share.  For the nine months ended           April 30, 1996, the Company recorded income from continuing operations of $1.2 million, or 3 cents per share.  This compares with a pro forma        loss of $2.1 million or 9 cents per share from continuing operations in the same period last year. 

<P>

Another indication of PureTec’s financial strength is our strong cash flow.  So far this year, we have amortized about $4 million in non-cash expenses as a result of certain accounting rules that governed last year’s merger, plus $8 million in depreciation and other amortization expenses.  This gives a year-to-date EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of about $1.17 per share.  We are taking advantage of this cash flow to grow the business, reduce debt, and improve future profitability.

<P>

<B>Featured Product Line:</B>	

<P>

In this report, I would like to highlight our line of medical products.  With the continuing concerns about infectious diseases such as AIDS and Hepatitis, there is a growing demand for disposable medical devices.  PureTec is the leading supplier of disposable tubing and FDA-grade plastic materials to the medical device industry.  PureTec formulates custom vinyl compounds to meet the high performance demands of leading manufacturers of such devices.  As these manufacturers develop new medical products, they rely on PureTec’s expertise in developing formulations that meet their specific requirements.  Of course, we also use our materials in our own growing line of medical tubing and related products.

<P>

Together, our products and materials are critical components in a wide range of new medical and surgical procedures.  It is our goal to continue to develop new products in support of medical advances being made by our customers.  In pursuit of this goal, we are upgrading our facility in Sparks, Nevada, and opening an additional European facility in Northern Ireland.  We look forward to continued strong growth in this dynamic area of our business.


<P>

We appreciate your continued support and confidence as we build the new PureTec Corporation.

<P>


 EATONTOWN, NEW JERSEY, September 3, 1996 - - PVC Container Corporation (NASDAQ:PVCC) today reported record sales and earnings for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1996. PVC Container Corporation’s revenues increased 6% to approximately $57,216,000, compared to $53,886,000. Net income increased 58% to approximately $2,553,000 or $.37 per share versus $1,611,000 or $.24 per share for the same period last year. Sales for the fourth fiscal quarter were approximately $16,168,000 compared to $14,225,000 for the same three month period a year ago, representing a 14% increase. Net income for the quarter also increased by 93% to $720,000 or $.10 per share compared to $374,000 or $.06 per share for the fourth quarter last year. 
<P>

"The results for the year demonstrate that our strategy has significantly improved the overall long term prospects for the Company," said Phillip L. Friedman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although lower polymer and raw material costs as well as higher capacity utilization of our manufacturing plants have favorably impacted earnings this year, our regional expansion of the plastic bottle business as well as our expanding sales into niche markets for rigid PVC compounds has played a major part in boosting earnings for the year by 58% on only a 6% increase in revenues," he said. Mr. Friedman noted that the Company’s recent expansion in its bottle business strengthened by its new plant in Paris, Illinois as well as its recent 
 acquisition of its Airopak specialty container business, has improved its overall strategic position in its blow molded plastic bottle business. The Company has also made progress in increasing its specialty rigid PVC compound business in several niche markets, resulting in an improvement in the profitability of the Company’s Novatec Plastics business.
<P>

Mr. Friedman announced, "We are extremely pleased with our performance and as a result of this major improvement in earnings, the Company is increasing its cash dividend by declaring today a dividend of 6¢ per share payable on September 20, 1996 to shareholders of record as of September 13, 1996. We are very gratified to have been able to reward our shareholders with dividends over the past six years, albeit small, while improving the quality and earnings potential for the Company by making some wise investments for our future. While it is our desire to maintain dividends in the future, our emphasis on the long term growth of the business will continue in the future." Friedman noted that in February of this year the Company declared a 3% stock dividend, and for the prior 4 years in a row has paid a 5¢ per share cash dividend.Eatontown, New Jersey
<P>

Mr. Friedman added, "Going forward, the prospects for continued long term growth look very positive. We see many opportunities to enhance shareholders’ value in our Company in all segments of our business. We are most excited about the 
 prospects of our latest blow molding venture in South Carolina, which should be operational later this year. This new 60,000 square foot manufacturing facility, constructed with low cost Industrial Revenue financing, will ultimately increase the Company's total blow molding capacity by approximately 25% percent. The new plant will be constructed on the Company’s 8.8 acre site located in Walterboro, South Carolina, and will allow ample room for the Company to continue to expand its operations in the future. Additionally, we have acquired new technology in injection stretch blow molding for PET bottles, that will strengthen our strategic position as well as provide many new opportunities to more aggressively expand our plastic bottle business in the future. Our specialty container business, Airopak Corporation, our Novatec Plastics compound business as well as our new joint venture, Edge Craft USA will also contribute to our success in the future."

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS</B>

<P>

 	This is our Third Quarter report about the progress of Pyramid Breweries Inc.  The information below, and other brewery news, is also posted on our innovative "virtual pub" website on the Internet (http://www.PyramidBrew.com) — recently ranked as "coolest on the web," alongside sites from Levi’s, Crayola, and Polaroid, by internet arbiters ‘projectcool.com.’  Financial and media releases may also  be obtained via fax through our toll free news on demand service at 1-888-329-5520.

<P>

<B>DEVELOPMENTS IN CRAFT-BREWING</B><BR>
	The craft-brewing industry has continued to change rapidly during the past three months.  More startup breweries are flooding the market and many existing craft-brewing companies are extending capacity and/or product lines.  Increased price discounting has squeezed margins for all.  The major brewers have stepped up their efforts to break into the craft-brewing segment, with Anheuser-Busch    being especially active.  Our advanced Northwest market, in particular, has shown signs of an emerging shakeout during the past quarter.
<P>

	In spite of these market conditions, Pyramid Breweries continues to expand and to operate more efficiently (with the highest operating income per barrel) than our publicly-owned craft-beer competitors.  During the first nine months of 1996, gross sales were $20.6 million, a 12.6% increase over the same period of 1995. Sales momentum slowed in the third quarter, however, due to increased competition in our core Northwest markets (which accounted for 61% of our sales through the first nine months of 1996).

<P>
We are responding aggressively to these developments in our home markets.  First, to increase draft market share— particularly important for exposure and consumer sampling— we have hired additional salespeople:  two in Oregon, one in Washington.  Second, we have stepped up  our promotional efforts for Pyramid Ales and Thomas Kemper Lagers with outdoor billboard advertising and increased media relations activities.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have secured additional resources   from our core wholesalers to ensure broader and deeper availability of our beers.

<P>
<B>
GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION </B><BR>
	We are pleased to report that growth in other markets has helped offset our decreased market share in the Northwest. We continue to believe that growing nationwide demand for fresh, flavorful ales and lagers represents a significant opportunity for Pyramid Breweries Inc. Working towards this goal during the Third Quarter of 1996, we achieved top-quality distribution in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C.  Pyramid Ales now are available in a total of 27 states.  To support this ongoing expansion, we continue to build our sales team — to its current level of 28 people, up from a total of 14 people in September 1995. 
<P>

 	One result of our accelerated expansion is that Pyramid Breweries will incur sales and marketing costs earlier than intended in our original plan.  These expenses will impact near-term earnings adversely, but I want to stress that they are investments in the long-term development and success of the company.  Moreover, we believe that our unique   strategy — brewing high-quality, distinctive ales and lagers across a national network of small regional breweries — gives us a distinct marketing and sales advantage over our competitors. Operating our own local breweries, in addition to conferring "hometown status," enables us to deliver the best beers in the freshest condition to different areas of the country. The breweries and their attached pubs also provide focus for our marketing strategy (based on sampling and consumer education).

<P>

<B>THE PYRAMID BREWERY & ALEHOUSE AT BERKELEY</B><BR>
	Construction is nearing completion later than we had hoped due to several last-minute delays.  The facility will be essentially complete in December; however, due to the holiday season’s disruptions, we now plan to open the Alehouse in January.  Test brewing should be underway in December, with commercial production commencing early in 1997.  The brewery’s refrigerated warehousing facility is already in use for trans-shipment. 
<P>

	We have significantly increased initial investment in the Berkeley facility to $14.5 million.  As construction progressed, we decided to carry out much of the work which would have been required for the brewery to reach full potential capacity.  At the same time, we extended its maximum annual design capacity from 160,000 barrels to 200,000 barrels.  We also decided to advance work on the building’s structure, primarily renewing the roof and walls and making off-site improvements.  We took these steps    now because of concern about the work interfering with production once the brewery is operating. The expense of advancing the work provides good value compared with the cost of interrupting or shutting down production at a later stage.  Furthermore, the long term lease on the property allows for recapture of certain structural works on exercise   of the purchase option.
<P>

	We have identified brewery sites in other cities, and should be able to make an announcement concerning these plans in the near future.

<P>

<B>PYRAMID & THOMAS KEMPER NEWS</B><BR>
	Our beers continue to attract critical and popular attention.  At the international World Beer Cup held in June, Thomas Kemper Hefeweizen was awarded the Gold Medal for American-Wheat Beers.  In September, Thomas Kemper Bohemian Dunkel received the Bronze Medal in the highly-competitive "Dark Lagers" category at the prestigious Great American Beer Festival. Thomas Kemper’s Oktoberfest seasonal, released in September, garnered positive reviews in national publications such as USA Today.  Furthermore, out of all Washington state brewers, Thomas Kemper has been selected to produce a special commemorative beer for the 1997 National Craft-Brewers Conference (scheduled for Seattle at the end of March).  As always, the recent release of Thomas Kemper WinterBräu and Pyramid Snow Cap Ale, an annual favorite, has generated much market excitement.  Watch for the introduction of several innovative Pyramid Ales during 1997!

<B>About QLogic:</B><BR>
QLogic Corporation is a leading designer and supplier of semiconductor and board-level I/O (input/output) products. The Company’s products provide high performance connections between a computer and its attached peripherals; for example, a PC and its hard disk drive. Any I/O channel requires interfaces for the host computer as well as its attached peripherals and QLogic supplies products for both of these markets. Historically, QLogic has targeted the high performance sector of the I/O market, focusing primarily on the SCSI  (Small Computer Systems Interface) standard.  The Company’s I/O expertise extends to emerging technology standards, such as Fibre Channel, which are now experiencing early industry acceptance.

<P>

<B> To Our Stockholders:</B>

<P>

Revenues for our second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 1996, rose to a record $16.7 million, up 28% compared to the $13.1 million reported for the same quarter a year ago.  Second quarter net income grew 450% to a record $1.2 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to the $214,000, or $0.04 per share, reported a year ago..

<P>

Second quarter revenues from the host computer sector expanded more than 80% from the year ago period, driven by increasing demand from our workstation and UNIX/NT server OEMs.  Our peripheral sector also continued to achieve sequential and year-to-year growth. Second quarter gross margin rose to 42.5% from 39.1% in the first fiscal quarter and from 35.3% for the same period a year ago, benefiting from improved manufacturing efficiencies and a shift in product mix towards board level products that carry higher margins.  We elected to increase the Company’s investment in research and development in the second quarter to a record level of $2.5 million, or 15.2% of revenues.  Operating profit improved from the same period a year ago and from the prior quarter, ascending to 11.2% of revenue. 

<P>

 
<IMG SRC="qlgcchart1.gif" align=right>Second quarter bookings during the quarter grew 10% sequentially, outpacing shipments.  During the last quarter, demand for QLogic’s high-performance I/O solutions increased as UltraSCSI-equipped disk drives became available and we initiated shipments to a significant new OEM in the workstation sector.  Many of QLogic’s design wins over the past year are based on the Company’s new-generation 40 Megabyte per second UltraSCSI technology, which provides a virtually transparent migration path from today’s 20 Megabyte per second FastSCSI standard.  During the quarter, we captured several new SCSI design wins in the host and peripheral sectors.

<P>

Having diversified our traditional SCSI business into a variety of peripheral and host computer OEM market sectors over the past two years, QLogic is now focused on broadening the array of I/O technologies that we offer to our expanded customer base.  In keeping with the Company’s strategy of providing transparent I/O migration paths to its OEMs, we are now extending our traditional SCSI product line to encompass the emerging high-end Fibre Channel standard, as well as the IDE standard, which is the prevailing I/O solution found on desktop computers today. 	

<P>

During the second quarter, QLogic’s balance sheet strengthened further as we achieved a record cash position of $9.6 million. We have grown our cash by $9.1 million since the first quarter of last fiscal year. With our improved cash balances, and unused credit facility of $7.5 million, QLogic’s financial position remains healthy.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>Third Quarter Report 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>


Dear Fellow Shareholders:

<P>

This is the first of quarterly letters we will be writing to you to keep you better informed of the changes occurring at Quaker and the progress we are making toward creating a future that will serve you and the Company well.  In addition to the financial information reported each quarter, we think it's important for you to have a richer understanding of what Quaker is hoping to accomplish and has achieved.  That will be our goal through these letters.

<P>

We're pleased to report that for our third quarter ended September 30, 1996, Quaker achieved record net sales of $61.8 million, which was 7% higher than the third quarter of 1995.  Our operating results also showed significant improvement, with these operating results up 32% over the comparable quarter last year, to $2.8 million.  If this result were translated into earnings per share comparable with last year's third quarter, we would have seen an improvement of 38%, from $.24 to $.33.  These operating figures do not include the consolidation charge against earnings of $13.1 million reflected in our income statement for the quarter.  About two-thirds of this charge are non-cash items, and its after-tax effect is $8.6 million or $1.01 per share, to bring our reported earnings per share for the quarter down to a loss of $.68. 

<P>

The improvement in our operating performance has resulted from our efforts to deliver more value to our customers through our products and services and to price these consistent with our ability to satisfy their needs.  Further, we continued to make advances in penetrating areas of the world, such as Asia/Pacific, where we think there are considerable growth opportunities.  To this end, in fact, we anticipate the start-up of our Chinese joint venture manufacturing facility, Wuxi Quaker Chemical Company Limited, in Wuxi, China, during the fourth quarter.  Also, we are working on finalizing a joint venture in India that should take advantage of long-standing relationships there and provide better access to the Indian market.

<P>

As you know, we announced in the second quarter our intention to consolidate our U.S. manufacturing operations, as well as to take steps in other areas around the world to better utilize our manufacturing capacity, to be more responsive to our customers, to lower our cost structure, and to improve the utilization of our assets.  The consolidation charge in this quarter reflects the implementation of the first and major part of the plan, consolidation of our two U.S. plants into one in Detroit.  We believe this will enable the Company to better serve our customers, a significant portion of which are located within a day's delivery of Detroit, and will better align our manufacturing capabilities with the multi-shift operation of many of our customers.  We expect the transition to be completed by year end.  The charges for the remaining series of consolidation actions contemplated in our second quarter announcement are expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter, and we continue to estimate the total charge to be in the range of $23 million.

<P>

As we went into this year, in addition to dealing with cost structure and customer value issues, we set a goal of reassessing our strategic direction.  This process is well underway now, and we expect it to be complete by year end.  By the end of the first quarter of 1997, our objective is to have articulated a revised strategic direction for the Company, including the definition of financial targets and goals built from a thorough, fact-based analysis of our capabilities and the opportunities that we can exploit.

<P>

On the whole, we believe we have made significant progress in "doing better" as we talked about in last year's annual report, and we look forward to continuing to build the strength and success of Quaker Chemical.

<P>

Sincerely,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>QUANTUM ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR <BR> SECOND FISCAL 1997 QUARTER</B><P>

<B>Performance on target for turnaround</B></CENTER>
<P>

MILPITAS, Calif., November 4, 1996 — Quantum Corporation (NMS:QNTM), today announced sales for its second fiscal 1997 quarter (ended September 29, 1996) of $1.12 billion and net income of $4.6 million or 8 cents per share fully diluted.   These results are consistent with comments the company previously made about the outlook for the September quarter.
<P>

"Although below our potential, our results this quarter reflect performance that is on target for our turnaround," said Michael Brown, Quantum's chief executive officer.  "Nine months ago, we embarked on a strategy to bring our high-end disk drive and recording heads businesses to a break-even position by the end of our fiscal year.  We must execute well over the next two quarters, but we have accomplished what we expected thus far."	
<P>

As anticipated, shipments of Quantum’s desktop-class hard disk drives were basically flat with the June quarter as the company executed a significant product transition.  "Our new Fireball TM (1GB - 3.8GB) products were qualified at the 10 largest personal computer manufacturers worldwide, and we shipped nearly 1.7 million of these drives in the September quarter," said Brown.  Quantum is the first company to ship this class of drives (1GB and 1.3GB per platter) in volume.  
<P>
 
Sales of Quantum’s DLT™ tape products increased to $150 million for the quarter.   "We continue to be very pleased with the market acceptance of our DLT technology," said Brown.  "Sales of our DLT products were up 20% from the June quarter and were nearly double what they were a year ago.   With the rapid growth of this business, ramping production to meet customer demand continues to be a key challenge for us."


<P>

In October, Quantum announced that it has begun production shipments of its 2.2, 4.5, and 9.1 GB Atlas II drives, the first high-end drives to be built by Quantum’s manufacturing partner, Matsushita-Kotobuki Electronics (MKE).  "Our Atlas II products are in qualification with virtually all the major high-end system manufacturers, and we are focused on completing those qualifications," said Brown.  "We believe that the consistency and production ramp capability we gain from our partnership with MKE will be a significant competitive advantage for us in the high-end marketplace," said Brown.
<P>
   
	Founded in 1980, Quantum Corporation designs, manufactures and markets storage products for today’s digitized world.  Widely recognized as the industry’s quality leader, Quantum sells a broad range of storage products to OEM and distribution customers worldwide.  Quantum’s sales for the fiscal year ending March 1996 were $4.4 billion.  The company’s world wide web home page address is <A HREF="http://www.quantum.com">http://www.quantum.com</A>.
<P>

The foregoing comments regarding our anticipated turnaround and the expected benefits of our relationsip with MKE are forward looking statements and actual results may vary.  Among the factors that could impact these expectations are the successful qualfication and market acceptance of our high-end products as well as the continued success of our new Fireball TM and other desktop products, MKE’s ability to execute the volume production ramp for our high-end products, and MKE’s ongoing ability to meet our manufacturing requirements.

The Quick & Reilly Group, Inc. Reports 22% Earnings Increase<BR>
For Second Quarter Ended August 30

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Palm Beach, FL., Sept. 24, 1996.  The Quick & Reilly Group, Inc. (NYSE: BQR) today reported higher earnings and revenues for the second fiscal quarter ended August 30, 1996. Net income for the quarter increased 22% to $18,648,000, or $.74 per share, compared with $15,347,000, or $.62 per share, earned in the second fiscal quarter a year ago. Revenues for the quarter rose 11% to $117,042,000, compared with revenues of $105,331,000 for the same period last year.
<P>

	"Performance of the Quick & Reilly Group continues to be strong in all three of our core businesses," said Leslie C. Quick, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.  "The July dip in the market was a test for our retail investors, but their interest in the market continues to be strong and we are well positioned to serve their needs.  At the same time, we continue our efforts to broaden and deepen our relationship with our customers and to add to the client base at Quick & Reilly, Inc. and U.S. Clearing Corp.  At JJC Specialist Corp., we were awarded  new company listings by the New York Stock Exchange during the quarter on the basis of performance."
<P>

	Highlights by Subsidiary During the quarter Quick & Reilly, Inc., the Group’s national brokerage unit, opened branch offices in Reno, Nevada; Jupiter, Florida; and a second office in Las Vegas, Nevada.  This brings the total  number of offices nationwide to 116, compared with 108 offices a year ago.
<P>

 	"We saw growing use of our electronic access and 24-hour trading services," Mr. Quick said.  "QuickWay Plus, our Windows-based computer investing software package enables customers to conduct research and analysis, retrieve news updates, track portfolios, and enter orders from their PCs.  During the quarter, we provided our QuickWay Plus customers with an enhanced news and information retrieval service from Reuters.  Earlier this year, our service was ranked by Barron’s as the on-line investing package that is easiest to use.
<P>

	"A growing number of our customers wish to transact business after the close of trading on the major exchanges," Mr. Quick noted.  "Many of our clients want the personal service provided by our 24-hour trading desk.  Others find it convenient to use Easy Trade, an automated 24-hour-a-day telephone trading system that gives clients access to quotations and provides updates on account positions and activity.
<P>

	"We will formally launch live trading and information retrieval through the Internet in the third quarter, and we will have a service as highly rated and competitive in its category as QuickWay Plus is in the on-line software category," said Mr. Quick.  
<P>

	U.S. Clearing Corp., which provides broker/dealers and banks with execution and clearing services, added 16 new clients to its list of correspondent firms during the quarter.  One of the leading providers of clearing services nationwide, U.S. Clearing has a client base of 313 firms.
<P>

	JJC Specialist Corp., the second largest specialist firm on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, was allocated four new company listings during the quarter -- Dal-Tile International Inc.; Dayton Superior Corporation; Paracelsus Healthcare Corporation; and Ryerson Tull, Inc.  JJC currently makes a market for 281 New York Stock Exchange issues, representing 228 companies, including 44 S&P 500 corporations.
<P>

	The Quick & Reilly Group, Inc., headquartered in Palm Beach, Florida, was founded in 1974 and was the first NYSE-member firm to offer discount commission rates.  It operates through three principal New York-based subsidiaries: Quick & Reilly, Inc.; U.S. Clearing Corp.; and JJC Specialist Corp.

3rd Quarter Report 1996

<P>

To our Stockholders, Customers and Employees

<P>

Throughout the third quarter of 1996, the business climate remained very favorable for Quickturn.  We are pleased to report that in the quarter ended September, 30 1996, revenue was $27.2 million, representing an increase of 28% over the comparable period in 1995.  Net income was $3,163,000 or $0.21 per share, representing a 28% increase over the third quarter of 1995.

<P>

During the first nine months of 1996, Quickturn has made steady progress toward establishing logic emulation as the dominant technology for the verification of highly complex chip designs.  The industry trend toward system-level virtual prototyping and incorporating disparate pieces of intellectual property onto system IC’s and ASICs has increased the need for robust verification solutions such as Quickturn’s System Realizer family of products.

<P>

During the third quarter of 1996, we also commenced shipment of our latest generation emulation software called Quest II.  This entirely new software offers substantial improvements in design, compile times, ease of use and total visibility during emulation and debugging.

<P>

In September, Quickturn entered into an alliance called the Virtual Socket Interface (VSI).   This coalition of EDA, semiconductor, systems and intellectual property vendors, which we believe to be unprecedented, seeks to develop standards that will allow users to mix and match intellectual property from multiple sources onto a single chip. 

<P>

We recently announced the appointment of Dr. David K. Lam to our Board of Directors.  Dr. Lam is a pioneering entrepreneur in Silicon Valley who founded Lam Research and is presently the Chairman and CEO of ExpertEdge Corporation.  Also we announced the appointment of Mr. Jeff Jordan as Vice President of North America Sales.  Jeff previously  was sales director in the eastern region of the U.S.
 

<P>

We thank you, our stockholders, customers and employees, for your continued support of Quickturn.

As the company exits its first quarter as a public company, our strategy continues to be to remain focused on the large format digital printing segment; to provide complete hardware and software solutions to our customers; to increase recurring revenues from consumables sales; to introduce new products based on our core technology; to expand our business in international markets; and to continue to look for synergistic acquisitions and alliances.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>Raster Graphics Reports Record Net Revenues and Net Income</B></CENTER>

<P>

On October 22, 1996, Raster Graphics, Inc., a leader in large format, on-demand digital printing systems and software, announced its eleventh consecutive quarter of record net revenues, and its ninth consecutive quarter of profitability, excluding charges taken in the third quarter of 1995 in connection with Raster Graphics’ acquisition of Onyx Graphics Corporation.
<P>

For its third quarter ended September 30, 1996, the company reported net revenues of $10,212,000, an increase of 49 percent as compared to $6,835,000 for the same period in 1995.  Net income increased 278 percent for the third quarter to $964,000, as compared to $255,000 from a year earlier, excluding charges incurred during the third quarter of 1995 associated with the acquisition of Onyx.  Earnings per share for the quarter was 11 cents, an increase of 266 percent, compared to 3 cents per share for the third quarter of last year, excluding acquisition charges.  Reported results for third quarter of 1995 were a net loss of $329,000 for the quarter, or a loss of 33 cents per share, including the charges associated with the Onyx Graphics acquisition.  
<P>

Net revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 increased 53 percent to $28,363,000, compared to $18,487,000 for the same period in fiscal 1995.  For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, Onyx Graphics results were only included from August 10, 1995, the date of acquisition, through September 30, 1995.  Net income increased 171 percent to $2,165,000, or 27 cents per share for the nine-month period, compared to $798,000 , or 11 cents per share for the same period last year, excluding acquisition charges.  Reported results for the first nine months of 1995 were a net loss of $55,000, or a loss of 5 cents per share, including the charges associated with the Onyx Graphics acquisition.
<P>

"We are very pleased with the results of Raster Graphics’ first quarter as a public company," said Rak Kumar, president and chief executive officer.  "Strong growth in international sales contributed to our record revenues.  Also, with the introduction during the quarter of the PosterShopTM family of production software, we saw significant growth in our software business, which more than doubled from a year ago to record levels," Kumar continued.  "Consumable sales were also strong in what has historically been the slow summer quarter.  In addition to our excellent operating results, the company exited the quarter with a significantly strengthened balance sheet, due to our successful initial public offering in August."<P>

Second Quarter Report<BR>
August 31, 1996 </B>      </CENTER>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>                  

For the fiscal year 1997 second quarter ended August 31, 1996, net income was $595,000 or $.07 per share compared to net income of $517,000, or $0.06 per share reported for the quarter ended August 31, 1995.  Revenues grew by 5% to $9,612,000, marking the eighth consecutive quarter the Company has reported revenue gains over the comparable prior year period.  Results in the year ago period include non-recurring income of $101,000 before taxes relating to a terminated management services contract. 

<P>

For the six month period, net income was  $906,000, or $0.11 per share, and includes a non-recurring charge of approximately $200,000 or $.02 per share before taxes.  For the six months ended August 31, 1995, the Company reported net income of  $825,000 or  $0.10 per share, including the non-recurring income described above.

<P>

On September 11, 1996, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which  HEALTHSOUTH Corporation (NYSE:HRC) will acquire the Company.  HEALTHSOUTH is the nation's largest provider of outpatient surgery and rehabilitation healthcare services with over 1,000 locations in 47 states.  The opportunity to  join forces with HEALTHSOUTH is very exciting.  We believe that  HEALTHSOUTH's reputation for high quality, cost-effective services, its relationship with insurers, managed care organizations and self-insured employers, and its resources will further strengthen ReadiCare's competitive position in our existing markets as well as provide opportunities for expansion into new markets.

<P>

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been approved by the boards of both companies, ReadiCare stockholders will receive .2425 shares of  HEALTHSOUTH common stock per ReadiCare share.  If  HEALTHSOUTH's average stock price were to rise above $38.30 per  share or fall below $30.60 during the measuring period, the exchange ratio would be adjusted.  The transaction, which is subject to approval by the stockholders of ReadiCare and which does not require a vote of HEALTHSOUTH's stockholders, is expected to be accounted for as a pooling of interests and is intended to be a tax-free reorganization.  Members of ReadiCare's senior management and Board of  Directors holding shares aggregating approximately 9.5% of the outstanding ReadiCare stock have given proxies to HEALTHSOUTH in connection with the transaction.  The transaction is subject to various approvals, including Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance, and to the satisfaction of certain other conditions, and is expected to close in late November  1996.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>   				
To Our Shareholders:					
	
<P>
				
We are pleased to report that Reliv posted strong increases in net sales and net profits for the third quarter of 1996 versus the same period in 1995.					
These results are particularly impressive, because they reflect improvement in virtually every  segment of our total business.					
	
<P>
				
Net sales in the 3Q totaled $9.93  million, up 45% from $6.84 million in the third quarter of 1995.  Our net profits grew to $338,000, or $0.04 per					
share, up 259% from $94,000 in the prior-year period.  Reliv's strongest performers were  our core U.S. network marketing business, which generated 					
3Q revenues  of $7.56 million, and contract packaging services, which produced $739,000 in sales.					

<P>
					
This marked the seventh straight quarter in which Reliv has posted double-digit or near-double digit growth in sales of nutritional products in the U.S.					
The performance of our Canadian operations was especially noteworthy.  Sales there increased 270% over the prior-year period.  Although Reliv					
sales declined 8% in Australia and New Zealand versus 3Q  '95 levels, there were signs that this business is starting to make a comeback.  For the first					
time this year, we saw an improvement in quarter-to-quarter revenues from Australia and New Zealand--with 3Q '96 sales up 9% versus 2Q '96 levels.					

<P>
					
After delivering strong revenue growth throughout 1996, our contract packaging business contributed to net income in the third quarter, turning its first					
profit since start-up in late 1995.  Through the first three quarters of the year, contract packaging services have generated $2.16 million in revenues for 					
Reliv, compared to less than $400,000 for all of 1995.					
	
<P>
				
It's gratifying to see these positive trends across all our lines of business--and we are determined to keep our momentum building through the remainder					
of the year.  We expect to get a significant boost in that regard from a new product we introduced in October.					

<P>
					
We're pleased to announce that Reliv has obtained exclusive U.S. network marketing rights for ArthaffectTM, a functional food product featuring an					
ingredient clinically shown to reduce the effects of degenerative joint conditions.  Arthaffect is our first entry in the $80 billion functional food category-					
an exciting area of nutrition science which develops food products designed to influence specific functions of the body.					

<P>
					
On the strength of this new product introduction--and the continued efforts of our valued network of Reliv distributors--we are confident that we can					
continue to build on the success we've experienced to this point in 1996.  As always, you can rest assured that we will keep our attention focused on					
increasing the value of your investment in Reliv.

RECORD FOURTH-QUARTER, YEAR END RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>MURRYSVILLE, PA, JULY 31, 1996</B> - RESPIRONICS, INC. (NASDAQ/NMS Symbol:  RESP) today reported record sales and earnings results for the three-month and full-year reporting periods ended June 30, 1996.

<P>

Net sales for the fiscal year's fourth quarter were $36.2 million, 28 percent more than the $28.3 million recorded for the closing three months of fiscal 1995. Net income for the period rose 38 percent to $4.8 million from $3.5 million a year ago, and earnings per share were 24 cents versus 20 cents for the fourth quarter last year. The per-share results reflect a 13-percent increase in the total number of shares outstanding in the quarterly comparison as the company completed a follow-on offering of stock in April 1996.

<P>

Net sales of $125.8 million for the full year were 26 percent higher than the $99.5 million reported for fiscal year 1995, and net income rose 31 percent to $15.3 million from $11.7 million.  Earnings per share for the fiscal years 1996 and 1995 were 84 cents and 67 cents, respectively.

<P>

The company’s performance for both the quarter and full year featured substantial gains by all of its core businesses, noted Dennis S. Meteny, president and chief executive officer.  "For both periods, the sales increase of our obstructive sleep apnea products approached 25 percent and the volume of our ventilatory business rose by more than 30 percent," Mr. Meteny reported.  "In summary, we were able to achieve meaningful growth while maintaining a balanced, productive business mix," he added.

<P>

Mr. Meteny also stated that the company continued to meet demanding internal standards of operational effectiveness.  "Net income for the year held at 12 percent of sharply increased net sales; gross margins were at a respectable 56 percent, and research and development spending increased over 30 percent to exceed $9 million," he noted.  "From the perspective of actually introducing new products and readying others for market, fiscal 1996 was our most active year to date," the chief executive said.

<P>

Robert D. Crouch, vice president sales and marketing, cited a steady increase in public awareness of the harmful effects of obstructive sleep apnea as a principal contributor to the company’s record results.  "The substantial size of the OSA market universe, combined with the prominence of our position both in the U.S. and overseas, continued to provide excellent opportunities for the application of our sleep therapy systems."  Mr. Crouch reported that international sales of Respironics products in fiscal 1996 amounted to nearly 25 percent of the year’s corporate total.

<P>

Separately, the company reported that it has received FDA 510(k) clearance to market its Solo™ CPAP System in the United States.  The introduction of Solo is in accord with Respironics’ announced strategy of providing innovative obstructive sleep apnea therapy systems at all key pricing points, Mr. Meteny said.

<P>

Respironics, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and sells respiratory medical products for use in the home, hospitals, and in emergency care situations.  Late in January, the company announced that it has been awarded ISO 9001 certification from the International Organization of Standardization, a Geneva, Switzerland-based quality standards organization.

<CENTER><B>RESPIRONICS RECEIVES 510(k) CLEARANCE ON ITS <BR>
BiPAP® VENTILATORY SUPPORT SYSTEM</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
MURRYSVILLE, PA, JULY 31, 1996—RESPIRONICS, INC. (NASDAQ/NMS Symbol: RESP) announced today that it has received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration to actively market its BiPAP S/T-D Ventilatory Support System for use in hospitals and institutions to treat appropriate patients suffering from both acute and chronic respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure.

<P>

The need for FDA clearance for these claims for the BiPAP Ventilatory Support System was one of the items in a December, 1994 warning letter which referenced the system’s application in certain critical treatment situations, reported Dennis S. Meteny, president and chief executive officer.  "We look forward to actively marketing the device to our customers for treating appropriate patients with respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure.  Moreover, we believe that the BiPAP S/T-D is the first device cleared under FDA’s new classification code (MNT) for critical care, passive exhalation port ventilators," he said.

<P>

The development and very thorough review of Respironics’ submission for the indicated uses of the product has enabled the company to gain valuable knowledge regarding submissions for ventilatory products, Mr. Meteny noted. "Throughout this process the company has strived to cooperate with the agency with open and effective communication.  We look forward to applying the very valuable knowledge we acquired to expanding the application of BiPAP devices and developing future products for the ventilatory market," the executive added.

Respironics, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and sells respiratory medical products for use in the home, hospitals, and in emergency care situations.  Late in January, the company announced that it has been awarded ISO 9001 certification from the International Organization of Standardization, a Geneva, Switzerland-based quality standards organization.

To Our Shareholders, Employees, Customers and Friends,

<P>

During the second quarter, the Company made progress in its path to recovery, continuing the corporate restructuring program that was initiated in late 1995 by the new Retix management team.  After stopping the decline in revenues for two consecutive quarters, the Company achieved second quarter revenue growth of 8.0% over the first quarter of 1996.  Gross margin in the second quarter rose to 65.7% from 60.1% a year ago. Operating expenses declined by 31.9% as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented over the past three quarters. As a result, the Company reduced its second quarter net loss to $951,000, or $0.05 per share, from the $3,201,000 or $0.18 per share reported for the same period a year ago.

<P>

 Retix continued its efforts to improve operating efficiencies during the quarter.  We achieved cost reductions by relocating our corporate headquarters to a smaller Marina del Rey site and subleasing the Company’s excess manufacturing facilities.  In addition, we selected an outsourcing partner for the manufacture of our internetworking products, which we expect to reduce our internetworking manufacturing costs.

<P>

The Company recently entered the next stage of its corporate restructuring, initiating spin-offs of the Internetworking business and the Wireless Data business into two separate subsidiaries.  These two new subsidiaries are flanked by the Vertel subsidiary specializing in network management solutions for the telecommunications marketplace that was spun off one year ago. While current Retix shareholders will retain their holdings of Retix stock, subsidiary employees will participate in separate employee option programs for each individual subsidiary. Our continuing strategy for the future is to leverage the Company’s core competencies in internetworking, network management software and wireless data communications with our revitalized and newly focused organizations.

<P>

In the aftermath of the most significant reorganization in Retix’s history, each of our three subsidiaries made progress in their developing businesses. The Company’s VertelTM network management subsidiary grew 16.4% in second quarter revenues as compared to the same quarter in 1995 and grew to 39.4% of total Retix revenue in the quarter. During the period, Vertel announced that its Power CatTM product line, based on the TMN specification, is  being  deployed by  Motorola, Inc.’s  Cellular

<P>

Infrastructure Group and U.S. West.  In addition, Vertel’s Power Cat technology will be integrated with the Tandem NonStop computing platform and the Versant Object Database Management System, both popular solutions in the telecommunications service provider sector. Our wireless data subsidiary revenues grew 33.0% from the first quarter of 1996.  Although revenues from the Company’s internetworking subsidiary during the second quarter of 1996 were significantly below the comparable period of 1995, operating results improved on a quarter-to-quarter basis during 1996.  Compared to the first quarter of 1996, the Internetworking subsidiary grew revenues 16.5%, realized a 4 point improvement in gross margin and reduced  operating expenses by 8.0% while investing in the development of the next generation of internetworking products. 

<P>

While we recognize that continued challenges lie ahead in the Company’s quest for profitability and growth, we are encouraged by the achievements of each subsidiary during the second quarter of 1996. We remain committed to leveraging the substantial potential of Retix in the three networking markets in which the Company operates: internetworking, wireless data and telecommunications management networks.

<P>

Sincerely,
 
<P>

<blockquote>To Our Shareholders and Fellow Employees:<P>

Net sales from continuing operations were $40.6 million, up 7.1% from $37.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 1995. Income from continuing operations increased 16.8% to $4.1 million, or $0.20 per share, from $3.5 million, or $0.18 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 1995.<P>

Our underlying sales growth is much stronger than the numbers indicate.  Sales in last year's second quarter were unusually high as we shipped inventory to over 2,000 Kmart stores and pipeline distribution to Kmart warehouses in the nationwide rollout.  In addition, as we have indicated previously, year-over-year sales to Phar-Mor continue to be down as a result of store closings.  Excluding both of these customers, total Company net sales increased by 27.4%.<P>

The Company's gross profit margin was 60.4% for the three months ended February 29, 1996 compared to 54.3% in the second quarter last year.  The gross profit margin increased due to continued gains in manufacturing efficiencies and improved product mix.  Additionally, the margin improvement was partially attributable to the increased proportion of total Company net sales related to Rexall Showcase International, the Company's direct sales subsidiary.<P>

Net sales for the six months ended February 29, 1996 rose 16.4% to $81.4 million from $70.0 million in the first six months of the prior year, however, excluding Kmart and Phar-Mor sales, total Company net sales increased by 32.3%.  Income from continuing operations increased 22.3% to $7.6 million, or $0.38 per share, from $6.2 million, or $0.32 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 1995.<P>   

In an effort to broaden ownership in Rexall Sundown by making more shares available for trading, we recently announced a 3 for 2 stock split to be paid in the form of a stock dividend.  The dividend will be paid on April 4, 1996 to shareholders of record as of March 25, 1996.<P>

We are well positioned to deliver another year of record performance.  Rexall Showcase International continues to show strong, positive momentum and the expansion and recognition of our flagship Sundown brand continues to gain acceptance with major retailers and consumers nationwide.  With virtually no debt and a strong cash position, we are building a solid foundation for the future.</blockquote><P>

<blockquote>To our Shareholders:

<P>

RF Power’s third quarter net income was $247,000, or $.02 per share compared to net income of  $731,000, or $.06 per share for the same period in fiscal 1995. Sales increased 17%, reaching $7,979,000, compared to  $6,692,000 last year. 

<P>

Our third quarter earnings were affected by the sharp slowdown throughout the semiconductor industry.  Major manufacturers of semiconductor capital equipment began to cancel and stretch-out shipments during the middle of the quarter. In response to this decline in orders, RFP has cut personnel and reduced manufacturing costs in anticipation of continuing weakness in the semiconductor industry for the remainder of the year.  

<P>

We believe the current weakness in the semiconductor equipment market is occurring in the context of an exceptionally robust secular upward trend in demand which stretches far into the future.  RF Power is gaining market share as our products are being employed in the newest generations of semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing equipment.  In addition, our diversification efforts are beginning to pay off.  Just last week, we successfully completed initial demonstrations of an industrial scale RF-based food defrosting system and expect to commence initial shipments of RF generators to a major manufacturer of food processing equipment in the fourth quarter. We believe RF Power can successfully deploy its core technology in this new market and reduce our dependence on the semiconductor industry.

<P>

As part of our efforts to further expand RF Power’s market opportunities, we have entered into a  50/50 joint venture, to be finalized shortly,  with a U.K. - based medical products company.   This joint venture aims at  marketing a patented, low-cost device employing RF technology for the treatment of menorrhagia, excess blood flow during the menstrual cycle.  This new device has shown great promise in clinical trials in Europe and South Africa during the past several years.

<P>

The majority of the 17% gain in second quarter sales is attributable to shipments of RF generators and matching networks to a major Northern California-based semiconductor equipment manufacturer.  Gross margin was 35%, compared to 40% of sales last year due to a shift in the product mix for the quarter.  Research and development expenses increased to 11% of sales from 8% of sales last year.  

<P>

For the nine months ended August 31, 1996, net income was $1,822,000 or $.15 per share, compared to  $569,000, or $.05 per share, for the same period last year.  Sales increased  44% to $25,722,000 from  $17,802,000 for the same period of fiscal 1995. Results for last year’s first nine months included a one-time, non-cash compensation expense of $957,000 before taxes.

<P>

In the current  weak semiconductor market, we are working hard to control costs and develop advanced RF generator products and matching networks for the "next generation" of semiconductor capital equipment.  Our investment in new product development, together with opportunities in food processing and medical industry applications, will support the expansion of our customer base and enhance RF Power’s future growth.  Thank you for your support.

<P>

To Our Stockholders:
<p>
	We are extremely pleased to report record net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 1996.  Net earnings for the twelve-week period ended October 14, 1995, were $6.5 million, or $0.31 per share, a 21.0% increase over net earnings of $5.4 million, or $0.25 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 1995.  For the twenty-four week period ended October 14, 1995, net earnings were $12.9 million, or $0.60 per share, an increase of 25.6% over net earnings of $10.3 million, or $0.48 per share, for the comparable prior year period.
<p>
	Sales for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 were a record $387.2 million, a 12.3% increase over sales of $344.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1995.  Fiscal 1996 year-to-date sales were $782.9 million, a 22.1% increase over sales of $641.1 million for the comparable period of fiscal 1995.  The increases were primarily attributable to sales to former customers of the wholesale division of Camellia Food Stores, Inc., which we acquired in April 1995, and the inclusion of twenty-four weeks of Rotelle, Inc. sales in the fiscal 1996 operating results, as compared to approximately eight weeks of Rotelle sales included in the second quarter of fiscal 1995.
<p>
	Operating and administrative expenses were $23.4 million, or 6.03% of sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 1996, compared to $21.7 million, or 6.31% of sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 1995.  The decrease in operating and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales, is primarily attributable to our continued focus on operating efficiency and cost control.
<p>
	We are pleased to announce that our acquisition of Super Rite Corporation became effective October 15, 1995.  Super Rite is a full-service wholesale food distributor supplying more than 240 retail supermarkets in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia.  Super Rite also operates a retail grocery division, consisting of ten METRO superstores in the Baltimore, MD and Dover, DE markets, and five BASICS supermarkets in metropolitan Baltimore.  We are extremely excited about the opportunities that are presented by this transaction, which creates a logistics and distribution powerhouse in the Mid-Atlantic region.  This acquisition will strengthen both companies by creating a larger, more diversified customer base and by offering opportunities to realize operating synergies and increased efficiencies.
<p>
	We currently are experiencing excellent momentum in sales, cost control and net earnings as we move forward with integrating our operations with those of  Super Rite.  Super Rite also is experiencing momentum in its operations, as reflected by the increased sales and net earnings reported in its most recent operating results prior to the acquisition date.  We are very excited about the Super Rite acquisition and look forward to the combined company continuing to be an industry leader in sales, efficiency and profitability.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

RINGER REPORTS IMPROVED <BR>
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B>
<P>


Dear Shareholder:
<P>


Our third quarter results for the period ended June 30, 1996 reflected sales of $4,006,000 compared to sales of $3,915,000 during the same period a year ago.  In addition, we realized net income for the quarter of $105,000 or $.01 per share compared to a net loss of $(565,000) or $(.05) per share for the same period last year. 

<P>

On a year-to-date basis, our net sales were $13,254,000 compared to $12,679,000 last year and our net income was $559,000 or $.05 per share compared to a net loss of $(952,000) or $(.09) per share in the prior year.

<P>

Year-to-date sales were up 4.5% over last year. This increase reflects double digit sales growth in our Safer® brand product line, offset in part by a decline in our fertilizer sales due to the effects of unseasonal weather earlier in the year. Our year-to-date net income of $559,000 represents a $1,511,000 improvement over last year and reflects the benefits of both our sales increase and expense reduction initiatives.

<P>

Our pending acquisition of The Chas. H. Lilly Company remains on track as we continue to complete our due diligence efforts while evaluating a number of financing proposals. 

<P>

<P>


<B>October 16, 1996</B>

<P>

Fellow Shareholders:
<P>

To provide additional perspective beyond the head-lines, Rubbermaid is making progress to restore quality growth.
<P>

Our move to acquire Graco speaks to our strategic, long-term focus on business development.  As the market leader in its core product lines, Graco is a solid performer which offers global sales potential. It en-larges our relationships with both customers and consumers, and it provides new opportunities for cross-marketing between the Graco and Little Tikes lines.
<P>

We also are addressing competitive challenges very aggressively in our companywide realignment. Almost midway through the plan, we are seeing tangible benefits and savings throughout our supply chain, including quantifiable improvements in our operating efficiencies and customer service.  
<P>

The positive momentum we reported to you in the first half of this year reflects that progress, yet the challenges detailed in this quarter’s report will make it difficult to attain the growth in profitability we had been expecting this year, despite significant gains in lower-ing our cost structure.
<P>

We are confronting these issues, and are hopeful that you see the opportunities we have sewn with our growth strategies. You have our commitment that we will stay focused on maintaining Rubbermaid’s leader-ship with superior quality, innovation and value, in everything we do.

<P>

Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<P>

<B>RUBBERMAID REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS IN LINE WITH PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED EXPECTATIONS</B>

<P>

WOOSTER, Ohio, October 16, 1996 -- Rubbermaid Incorporated (NYSE: RBD), as expected, announced net earnings of $46 million, or 31 cents per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, compared with $50 million, or 32 cents per share, a year ago. Net sales for the quarter were $633 million, compared with $642 million last year.  
<P>

Core continuing unit volume was up six percent for the quarter, while divested or otherwise discontinued product stock-keeping units (SKUs) had a negative five percent impact.  Results also reflect the negative effect of a four-percent decrease in pricing and a two-percent positive contribution from acquisitions.
"As we noted last month, our results reflect lagging sales of large outdoor juvenile products and the effects of continuing sharp increases in plastic resin costs over past months," said Wolfgang R. Schmitt, chairman and chief executive officer. "These factors have directly offset the ongoing fundamental improvements being made throughout our business."

<P>

NINE-MONTH RESULTS:
<P>

For the nine months, net earnings were $133 million, or 88 cents per share, compared with $133 million, or 84 cents per share, in 1995.  Sales were $1.739 billion in 1996 compared with $1.762 billion in the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

Schmitt said the company’s two-year realignment plan launched last December is on track.  Additional developments over the last nine months, such as the acquisition of Graco and continued progress of globalization, will contribute to 1997 growth.
 
<P>

"We are very pleased by the additional, strategic growth prospects afforded by our recent acquisition of Graco Children’s Products Inc., and the many synergies it has with our business" said Schmitt. "With common customers and channels of distribution, Graco extends the brand strength and breadth of products we have to offer consumers around the world."

<P>

"In addition, our new management structure in Europe is in place and leading our expansion, while our efforts to establish a similar organization in the Asia-Pacific area are well under way," Schmitt said.
<P>

"We are seeing further evidence that the benefits of streamlined operations and logistics are improving our cost structure and customer service, which should translate into improved financial results in 1997 and beyond," Schmitt said. "However, continued high raw material costs, overall soft retail demand and lagging sales of Little Tikes juvenile products will challenge our performance through the remainder of the year."
<P>

"We have tenaciously maintained our commitment to new product development and heightened brand support. Most importantly, we are respond-ing to our challenges with appropriate actions, while investing in the systems and infrastructure to achieve the world-class competitive standards required for quality growth."

<P>

We are very pleased with the positive results our team has achieved this quarter.  The plans we have implemented to improve our operating results have created a solid foundation upon which to build and continue to provide positive momentum as we begin our first year as an independent public company.

<P>
For the first quarter, revenue from continuing
operations was $157,282,000, an increase of 7.8 percent
over the same quarter of the last fiscal year.  Net income 
from continuing operations was $5,489,000, up 30 
percent from the same period of the last fiscal year.  
Earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.31 versus $0.24 for the same period a year ago, an increase of 29 percent.  Same-store sales for first quarter were down 2.2 percent in Ruby Tuesday.

<P>
During the first quarter, RTI opened seven Ruby Tuesdays and one Mozzarella's Cafe conversion, and closed one Ruby Tuesday.  As of August 31, 1996, RTI owned and operated 372 restaurants including 307 Ruby Tuesdays, 47 Mozzarella's Cafes, and 18 Tia’s Tex-Mex Cantinas. 

<P>

As we move forward, we will continue to focus on providing our guests great food and service at an outstanding value in a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere.  By doing this we can grow our business and accomplish our mission to be the restaurant of choice for our guests, a great place to work, and a rewarding investment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   To Our Shareholders:
<P>

	We were pleased to report record revenues, net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 ended September 30, 1996.  Revenues increased 33% to $74.0 million from the first quarter last year.  Net income for the quarter was $3.3 million, 57% above the prior year's quarter.  Earnings per share were 28 cents for the first quarter of 1997 compared with 23 cents last year.  Weighted average shares outstanding increased 28%  to 11.9 million in the recent first quarter versus 9.3 million a year ago, largely reflecting the stock offering completed last April of 1.4 million shares.
<P>

	Our results reflect the strength in both our ambulance service and fire operations and an improvement in the operating margin to 8.9% from 8.6%.  Our ambulance operations continue to benefit from growth in the core business as well as the contribution from recent acquisitions.  During the first quarter, we renewed and extended two of our largest ambulance service contracts.  While "911" ambulance service contracts are generally quite stable, they are not guaranteed.  In Rochester, New York, our contract has been extended through September 1998, with a further two-year extension if we continue to meet specified performance standards.  In Orange County, Florida, our "911" and general transport contract, covering most of the Orlando area, was also extended through September 1998.
<P>

	The ambulance industry continues to consolidate, and Rural/Metro's ability to attract the industry's elite providers was further evidenced in our most recent acquisition announcement.  During the quarter, we reached agreement to acquire Commonwealth Ambulance, the largest ambulance service provider in Kentucky.  This acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with our existing operations in Ohio, Indiana and Tennessee.  Commonwealth generates approximately $10 million in revenues annually. 
<P>

	We also announced the signing of our first statewide contract to provide comprehensive medical transportation services to the 550,000 managed care plan enrollees in Aetna Health Plans of Ohio, one of the largest managed care insurers in the country.  This two-year contract was made possible by the extensive coverage and alliances that we have formed throughout the state of Ohio.  The agreement is strategically significant to Rural/Metro because it will allow us to get hands-on experience in managing ambulance operations across a large geographic area under a managed care system.  While initially this two-year contract is on a fee-for-service basis, we expect that it will evolve to a risk-sharing capitated arrangement in the years to follow.  We will continue to pursue new affiliations and alliances in the health care arena, where we believe Rural/Metro can add value.
<P>

	Our fire protection service also continues to grow.  During the first quarter, we signed two new contracts.  The first is a three-year $3 million contract with the Heath-Newark-Licking County Airport Authority, located outside Columbus, Ohio.  Under this agreement, Rural/Metro will provide firefighting and hazardous materials response service.  The second contract is for crash/rescue and firefighting services at the Lafayette Regional Airport in Lafayette, Louisiana.  This is a four-year contract expected to generate approximately $2 million in revenue.  
<P>

	Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the future of Rural/Metro.  Our goal is to achieve balanced, sustainable growth, and we believe that with our experience, concentrated presence in growing geographic areas, and operational efficiencies, we are well-positioned to achieve this goal.  The ambulance service industry continues to consolidate, and Rural/Metro will pursue acquisitions where they make sense from both a strategic and financial perspective.  There are increasing opportunities to expand our ambulance service business under new alliances and affiliations with not-for-profit hospitals, health care payors and other health care providers.  Finally, we continue to pursue fire service contracts with airports and other specialized industries.  As the health care and fire safety industries continue to evolve, Rural/Metro remains on the forefront, seeking innovative ways to serve its clients' needs and enhance value for our shareholders.  
<P>

	We appreciate your support and look forward to updating you on our progress.

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:
<P>


On September 12, 1996, the Company made the announcement provided below regarding the acquisition of Columbus Plastics. After conducting an extensive search, the Company believes that it has identified a value-building transaction that utilizes RYMAC's attributes and places the Company in a growth potential business.  RYMAC stockholders should be aware of the potential for substantial increases in the purchase price due Navistar if individuals or investor groups take ownership positions that exceed 5%.

<P>

In anticipation of the Columbus Plastics transaction, the majority of the Company's remaining mortgage assets were sold during 1996's second quarter and are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations presented below.

<P>

We look forward to receiving your support and approval of the acquisition through a detailed proxy that will be mailed upon approval by the SEC.  It is expected that such mailing will occur in mid-November.

<P>

	RYMAC, NAVISTAR SIGN PURCHASE AGREEMENT<BR>
	FOR COLUMBUS PLASTICS OPERATION<P></CENTER>

	STEUBENVILLE, OHIO (September 12, 1996)  -- RYMAC MORTGAGE INVESTMENT CORPORATION (AMEX: RM) and Navistar International Transportation Corp., a subsidiary of Navistar International Corporation (NYSE: NAV), today entered into a definitive purchase agreement, whereby RYMAC will acquire a majority interest in Navistar's Columbus Plastics Operation.
<P>

	Under the terms of the agreement, RYMAC will acquire all the assets of the Columbus Plastics Operation for a note in the principal amount of $25,504,000 and 4,264,000 newly issued shares of RYMAC common stock, resulting in an aggregate purchase price of approximately $38,000,000.  The issuance of 4,264,000 shares of RYMAC common stock to Navistar will result in Navistar becoming a 45% stockholder of RYMAC.

<P>
	The agreement provides that the shares to be issued to Navistar will be reduced, if necessary, to preserve RYMAC's capability to apply its net operating losses to post-closing income.  Such price adjustments could be triggered in the event existing RYMAC stockholders or other investors purchase RYMAC common stock that would result in an ownership position of 5% or more by any single investor or by investors acting together.  The reduction of shares issued to Navistar would be compensated by an increase in the note due to Navistar by an amount significantly in excess of the assumed value of the reduced shares.

<P>
	Additionally, should the combined company achieve earnings results above projected levels during 1997 through 1999, Navistar will receive incremental consideration in the form of additional principal amounts on its note.

<P>
	RYMAC, based in Steubenville, Ohio, is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT), whose investments have substantially been liquidated.  Upon completion of the transaction, RYMAC will terminate its status as a REIT and will be headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.

<P>
	The transaction is expected to be completed by year end and is contingent upon approval of RYMAC stockholders at a special stockholders meeting and other conditions.

<P>
	Columbus Plastics was opened by Navistar in 1981 and has 480 employees.  It produces large sheet molding compound (SMC) components for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Navistar, Yamaha and General Motors.  Its 1995 sales were approximately $65 million.

<P>
	All of the employees at Columbus Plastics will remain with the new company.  Contracts with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 1471, are expected to essentially remain in place.

<P>
	Chicago-based Navistar manufactures and markets International® brand medium and heavy trucks, school bus chassis, and mid-range diesel engines in the United States, Canada and Mexico.  The company is the North American market share leader in combined sales of medium and heavy duty trucks and school buses.  In addition, Navistar is the worldwide leader in manufacturing mid-range engines from 160 to 300 horsepower.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>S3 INCORPORATED SECOND QUARTER 
	1996 RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Shareholders,
<P>

Our second quarter was marked by substantial year over year growth and a number of key milestones and announcements.  We achieved net revenues for the second quarter of $103.8 million, a 47% increase compared to $70.6 million for the second quarter of 1995.  Net income for the quarter increased 10% to $8.8 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to net income for the same quarter last year of $8.0 million, or $0.17 per share.  Common and equivalent shares outstanding for the second quarter 1996 were 50.1 million, compared to 46.1 million shares in the second quarter 1995.
<P>

	Our net revenues for the first six months of 1996 increased 67% to $213.9 million, compared to $128.0 million for the first six months of 1995.  Net income for the first six months of 1996 increased 50% to $21.1 million, or $0.42 per share, compared to net income of $14.1 million or $0.32 per share in the first six months of 1995.
	
<P>
The quarter marked a significant milestone for S3 as we shipped our one millionth ViRGE 3D accelerator.  Although our second quarter revenue and EPS were lower than those achieved in the first quarter of this year, due primarily to the competitive impact and continuing price erosion in the 2D market, the strong contribution from our ViRGE 3D products helped to reduce this impact on our financial results. We believe the rapid acceptance of our ViRGE products as demonstrated by the recent design wins with Compaq and Packard Bell, combined with our mobile offering and upcoming audio and communications products, positions us well as we enter the second half of 1996.
<P>

<U><B> ViRGE 3D Highlights</B></U>
	
<P>
With over one million units of ViRGE shipped to more than 22 add-in-card, OEM and systems manufacturers worldwide, we are in a leading position to bring 3D graphics to the mainstream PC market.  By working with S3, our customers enjoy S3d marketing programs and the most comprehensive list of compatible 3D software titles -- all designed specifically to work with the ViRGE 3D accelerator.  In addition, ViRGE offers pin-for-pin compatibility with our Trio family of accelerators--the industry’s largest selling 2D accelerators, and offers system users exceptional 2D performance.
<P>
<B>
<U>S3 Announces Aggressive S3d Marketing Program for its ViRGE 3D Accelerator</U></B>
	
<P>
At the E3 trade show in Los Angeles, we launched an aggressive S3d Marketing Program with more than 30 participating hardware and software vendors.  The S3d marketing program offers innovative ways for the end-user to identify real-time 3D graphic products that take advantage of S3’s leading S3d accelerator technology. These programs help to promote sales into the rapidly expanding 3D market and include a logo program, bundling program, advertising program, public relations program, trade show program and much more.
<P>
<U>
<B>Dell Computer Announces its support for ViRGE 3D technology</B></U>
	
<P>
Joining the growing list of 3D hardware and software customers, Dell Computer unveiled its plans to implement S3’s ViRGE 3D accelerator in future Dell Dimension PCs.   Dell Computer was one of the first hardware vendors to participate in the S3d Marketing Program.

<P>
<U><B>S3 Supports Intel’s Accelerated Graphics Port </B></U>
	
<P>
Continuing our collaboration with Intel, we announced our support of Intel’s new Accelerated Graphics Port.  This new port will work cooperatively with S3’s ViRGE 3D accelerators by providing the necessary bandwidth for high-performance 3D graphics on Pentium Pro processor-based PCs.  By providing 3D capabilities at mainstream price points and broadening end-user awareness through the S3d Marketing program, we are driving the acceptance of S3d technology in the PC market and allowing for the development of compelling, interactive, hardware-accelerated 3D titles.
<P>
<B>
<U> S3 to Deliver the 3D Platform for Intel’s Future Family of Processors</B></U>
	
<P>
As the largest supplier of graphic and video accelerators, we confirmed that our ViRGE family of 3D and Trio family of 2D accelerators will support both the Accelerated Graphics Port (A.G.P.) and MMX as the next generation accelerator platform.  By off-loading CPU intensive tasks to the hardware accelerator, S3 has continually revolutionized graphics and video performance on the PC.  As the PC architecture changes, we intend to further extend multimedia capabilities to provide even higher performance.
<P>

<U><B>S3 Announces the Industry’s Fastest 2D accelerator--the Trio64V2</B></U>
	
<P>
On June 3, we extended our leadership in the business desktop market with our highest performance accelerator--the Trio64V2 graphics and multimedia accelerator.  S3’s Trio64V2 is designed to deliver the high-performance quality video playback required for the emerging Internet, Intranet and multimedia-intensive applications.

<blockquote><B>SANIFILL REPORTS 28% INCREASE IN FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE</B><P>

	Houston, Texas (February 20, 1996) -- Sanifill, Inc. (NYSE-FIL) announced net earnings of $8.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 1995 and earnings per share of $.37, up 54% and 28% respectively from the $5.3 million and $.29 per share earned in the same quarter last year.  Revenues in the current quarter were up 34% to $68.9 million.<P>

	Full year net earnings of $27.9 million and earnings per share of $1.38 (net of $.02 in poolings costs) were up 45% and 29% respectively from the $19.2 million and $1.07 per share earned last year.  Revenues in 1995 were up 33% to $256.7 million.<P>

	The Company achieved "same-store" revenue gains at its solid waste disposal facilities of 12% in the fourth quarter and 12% for 1995 as a whole.  Acquisitions contributed significantly to 1995's results, with $120 million of estimated annual revenues acquired during the year.  In 1995 the Company entered six new landfill markets through the acquisition of five operating facilities and through the acquisition of land and permits to construct and operate facilities.  Each of these is expected to serve as a center for future growth under Sanifill's disposal-based strategy.<P>

	Lorne D. Bain, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said "Sanifill's earnings results reflect a combination of factors, including strong revenue growth both internally and from acquisitions, improved margins, and reduced selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales.  Viewed more broadly, the Company's performance reflects our growing role in the consolidating of our industry, our proven disposal-based strategy and our growth culture.  The final ingredient is a dedicated and focused team which executed very effectively in producing these record results."<P>

	Bain further commented that, "All recycled commodity sales represent less than 2% of Sanifill's revenues.  However, our average fiber price declined from $118.00 per ton in the third quarter to $57.00 per ton in the fourth quarter, an impact of slightly over $.01 per share in the fourth quarter compared with third quarter results.  We are anticipating that the average first quarter 1996 fiber price will equate to that of the fourth quarter which, if realized, should not result in further earnings erosion related to commodity pricing.  As to the impact of the weather, relatively few of our operations are located within the hardest hit areas and, where we have realized work interruptions, to this point the unaffected areas have experienced largely offsetting improvements."<P>

	Rod Proto, President and Chief Operating Officer, said, "Activities to provide growth in 1996 and future years are off to a good start.  This year we have acquired operating businesses providing an estimated $17 million in annual revenues and, as of today, we have transactions involving an additional $50 million in estimated annual revenues under letter of intent.  While there can be no assurances that transactions under letters of intent will close, I believe we are well-positioned for 1996 acquisition growth to equal or exceed 1995's record level.  We also acquired a major landfill and transfer station development project to serve the Baltimore/Washington market.  Given the proximity of these facilities to the seven million people in this major market, we expect this project to become one of the Company's major operations.  Construction has begun and we expect to open the landfill in the third quarter of 1996."<P>

	"The 1995 fourth quarter caps a very gratifying year operationally.  Contracts with municipalities for collection services previously have been an insignificant portion of Sanifill's revenues, but in 1995 the Company placed new emphasis on this market sector.  Municipal contracts involving approximately $7.5 million in annual revenues were commenced during the year and a significant backlog is being pursued in 1996.  The validity of our policy to use people to drive growth was borne out as margins were maintained or expanded while, at the same time, we were also concentrating on integrating the 46 operations we acquired.  Among our key indicators of operational success was the record expansion of our permitted landfill airspace by 111% after replacing airspace consumed in 1995, with 52% of that increase being derived from internal projects as opposed to acquisitions.  With landfill airspace the centerpiece of our disposal-based strategy, we strive each year to replace consumption and add new airspace for growth," said Proto.<P>

	Sanifill, Inc., headquartered in Houston, Texas, is an environmental services company specializing in the management and disposal of nonhazardous waste in 21 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Mexico.</blockquote><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>3rd Quarter <P>

Report to Stockholders	</B>
<P>
							
For the period ended September 30, 1996

<P>

	The Company is pleased to announce third quarter earnings per share of $0.10, a 233% increase over the third quarter 1995 earnings per share of $0.03.  Net income was $2.2 million for the third quarter of 1996, a 135% increase as compared to the third quarter 1995 net income of $0.9 million.  Earnings per share increased to $0.26 for the first nine months of 1996 compared to primary and fully diluted earnings per share of $0.18 for the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

	"Schawk continues its steady earnings progress as demonstrated by this strong quarter in spite of challenging market conditions," said David A. Schawk, Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Schawk continued, "Given the recent acquisitions of the Stanmont Group in Canada and Converterscan on the East Coast, we believe that our Imaging and Information Technologies Group ("Imaging Group") performance will continue to improve in 1997.  The Plastics Group has shown improvement in its operating margin this year, which we also believe will continue in 1997.  The Company has remained focused this year on its strengths, and the earnings expansion is a reflection of this refocused strategic direction."
<P>

	Net sales of $40.5 million for the third quarter of 1996 changed less than 1% from net sales of $40.7 million for the third quarter of 1995.  Net sales for the first nine months of 1996 of $123.9 million declined 2% from net sales of $131.4 million for the first nine months of 1995 after accounting for the disposition of Plastic Molded Concepts ("PMC") in May of 1996 (decline of 6% with PMC included).
<P>

	Sales in the Plastics Group increased by 1% after accounting for the disposition of PMC (decline of 10% with PMC included).  Sales in the Imaging Group increased by 4% over the same period.  The acquisitions of Converterscan, Inc. and Stanmont, Inc., which had two months and one month of sales respectively included in the third quarter, contributed to the Imaging Group sales for the quarter.  Both acquisitions were accretive to earnings in the third quarter. 
<P>
 
	Operating income increased 110% to $4.8 million for the third quarter of 1996 versus operating income of  $2.3 million for the third quarter of 1995.   The operating margin increased to 12% for the third quarter of 1996 from 6% in the comparable period of 1995.  Improvement was due to lower cost of sales, a favorable plastics product mix and a continued focus on lower selling, general and administrative expenses.  SG&A declined 3% for the third quarter of 1996 as compared to the third quarter of 1995. 
<P>
 
	For the nine month period, operating income increased 37% to $12.9 million, as compared to operating income of  $9.4 million for the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

	Net other expense declined to $1.3 million for the third quarter of 1996 from $1.6 million for the third quarter of 1995 as a result of lower interest expense due to debt reduction.  For the first nine months of 1996, net other expense decreased to $3.7 million compared to $4.2 million for the same period of 1995.
<P>

	Net income available for Class A Common stock increased 214% to $1.9 million for the third quarter of 1996 compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter of 1995.  For the nine month period, net income available for Class A Common stock increased by 44% to $5.1 million from $3.5 million for the first nine months of 1995.   The income tax provision for the third quarter and first nine months of 1995 includes a credit of $0.5 million and $1.1 million respectively related to losses from the discontinued operations in Germany recorded on the Company’s books in 1993, for which no tax benefit was previously recorded.  The tax credit is not available for 1996.

Letter to Shareholders
<P>


Revenues for the third quarter of 1996 increased to a record $54,027,000, compared to $50,921,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 1995. This quarter's revenue represents a growth of over six percent from the previous quarter, nearly 13 percent over the first quarter, and almost 15 percent over the last quarter of 1995. Net profits for the third quarter of 1996 were $3,306,000, or $0.09 per share, as compared to $1,205,000, or $0.04 per share, for the same quarter in fiscal 1995.

<P>

Revenues for the nine month period ending June 30, 1996 were $152,676,000 compared to $152,177,000 for the same nine month period in fiscal 1995. Net loss for the nine month period ending June 30, 1996, including non-recurring charges, was $26,486,000, or $0.74 per share, compared to $3,528,000, or $0.11 per share, for the same period in fiscal 1995. Excluding the after-tax impact of non-recurring charges, nine month earnings per share were $0.24 and $0.29 for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Non-recurring charges occurred in the first quarter of each fiscal year, and related primarily to the purchase of the UNIX business from Novell in 1996 and the purchase of Visionware Limited in 1995.
 

<P>

"I'm pleased with the progress we've been making. During the first six months of 1996, we made great strides in integrating the 
UNIX business acquired from Novell, and on activities to improve our balance sheet. We managed to reduce inventory with our major channel partners, we emphasized expense control measures throughout the company, and we have better managed receivables, cash and short-term investments. As we were taking these steps, we continued to invest in development, technology acquisitions and license buy-outs improving the competitiveness of our products."
<P>


"In the third quarter of 1996, we began delivering on the vision of a NEW SCO. We entered new businesses with the delivery of multiple products from our Layered Products Division, including a series of  Internet products to be marketed through our extensive network of resellers. We introduced a new channel architecture designed to strengthen relationships and initiate aggressive marketing activities with our channel partners. We won new business opportunities with major accounts including Chrysler, Siemens Rolm, Pizza Hut, and Michael's Stores. We entered a joint development project with Data General, ICL and HAL to integrate enterprise-class NUMA clustering technology, thus taking another step in the plan to make SCO UnixWare the standard UNIX operating system for volume enterprise servers. These efforts, and the previously announced project with HP, adds momentum to SCO's presence as the UNIX systems market leader."

Announces First  Quarter Results
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Seagate Technology , Inc. reported revenue, net income and fully diluted net income per 
share of $2.06 billion,  $129 million and $1.06,respectively, for its quarter ended September 27, 1996. 
This compares with revenue, net income and fully diluted net income per share for the quarter ended
September 29, 1995 of $2.14 billion, $121 million and $1.05, respectively.  During the quarter ended
September 27, 1996, the Company reversed approximately $9.6 million of its restructuring accrual
in connection with its February 1996 merger with Conner Peripherals, Inc.  The reversal was a result of 
the completion of certain aspects of the restructuring plan at less than the originally estimated cost.  This
reversal was offset by approximately $9.5 million in other non-recurring merger-related costs incurred during this period.  The results for the quarter ended September 29, 1995 included a one time write-off of in-process research and development of $2.8 million incurred in connection with the aquisition of Sytron Corporation.  Without this write-off and its related tax effect, fully diluted net income per share for the quarter ended September 29, 1995 would have been $1.07.  
<P>

	Revenue, net income and fully diluted net income per share for the immediately preceding quarter ended June 28, 1996 were $2.01 billion, $101 million and $0.84, respectively.  Without non-recurring merger-related costs and one time write-offs of in-process research and development totaling $42.4 million and their related tax effects, fully diluted net income per share for the immediately preceding quarter ended June 28, 1996 would have been $1.04.
<P>

	The merger with Conner was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and accordingly all prior periods have been restated to reflect this transaction.
<P>

 	This release may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations.  Actual results could differ materially as a result of several factors including demand for computer systems, competitive factors, the ability of the Company to introduce new products on a cost effective and timely basis, availability of components, and other factors listed in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended June 28, 1996 and its other SEC filings.
<P>

	Seagate Technology is a data technology company that provides products for storing, managing and accessing digital information on the world’s computer and data communications systems.

<BLOCKQUOTE>    To Our Shareholders:
<P>


It's hard to believe the year is almost over.  As we approach
1997, we can look back on this past year as one of significant 
change for your Company.  We set the course for the future
by combining our Nevada and California banking franchises
under the banner of "SierraWest Bank".

<P>

As we prepare ourselves for 1997 we are taking a hard look at every aspect of our business. We are very aware of the need to increase the return to you, our shareholders and owners.  We strongly believe we have set the Company on a path that will maximize your long term benefit, provide a rich and rewarding environment for our employees and a warm and friendly place for our customers to do business.

<P>

I'm pleased to share with you the following highlights and financial information for our third quarter of 1996.

<P>

Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 were $41.1 million, resulting in earnings of $2.9 million ($0.21 per share). The comparable results for the third quarter of fiscal 1995 were net sales of $37.2 million and earnings of $4.5 million ($0.32 per share).
<P>


We shipped two new versions of our automated batch chemical tool (Magnum®) during the quarter. One of the new Magnums incorporates carrierless spray processing while the other features immersion processing. We also shipped the first two production models of our VTP1500 Express® vertical furnace. Costs associated with building these new tool models and staffing to higher levels in anticipation of increased shipment volume combined with a delay in tool shipments were the most significant factors in our lower profitability during the third quarter. Four tools with a combined sales price of $5.4 million were carried over to the fourth quarter from the third.
<P>


Semitool booked a record $61 million in new orders during the third quarter resulting in a $110 million backlog at June 30, 1996. Our new orders were heavily weighted toward our automated chemical processing systems and our vertical furnace which continue to be the two largest components of our backlog.  Meeting production commitments remains management’s primary focus and we believe, based upon the increased backlog, the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 will improve.
<P>


For the nine months ended June 30, 1996, Semitool reported net sales of $122.7 million compared to $87.9 million for the corresponding period in fiscal 1995. Earnings for the first nine months of fiscal 1996 totaled $11.9 million ($0.86 per share), compared to pro forma net earnings of $9.3 million ($0.77 per share) for the same period last year.

<P>

Dear Fellow Shareholder:
<P>

	Following are the financial results from the third fiscal quarter and nine month period ending September 30, 1996.  These results reflect increased research and development costs associated with continued expansion of our gene discovery efforts and development of our functional genomics capabilities.  This is an exciting period of growth for Sequana as we continue to build our franchise in the functional genomics arena.  The pharmaceutical industry needs access to technologies such as ours that can potentially reduce the time-span between gene discovery and drug discovery, and through our development efforts we are positioning Sequana to take advantage of that opportunity.
<P>

	Sequana’s net loss for the third quarter was $5,382,000, or $0.54 per share, on revenues of $2,349,000, compared with a loss of $1,643,000, or $0.22 per share, on revenues of $2,069,000 for the third quarter of 1995.
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, Sequana reported a net loss of $12,878,000, or $1.36 per share, on revenues of $7,122,000, compared with a loss of $4,418,000, or $0.74 per share, on revenues of $6,710,000 for the same period in 1995.
<P>

	At September 30, 1996, Sequana had approximately $59 million in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities.
<P>

	Again, I thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>  <CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER REPORT</B></CENTER>
<P>



To Our Shareholders:

<P>

We are pleased to report Service Experts' first quarter as a publicly traded company.  Thank you for your investment.

<P>

The objective of our new company is to lead the consolidation of the residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) business – a $24 billion industry.  Our approach is to introduce professionalism and management disciplines to our highly fragmented industry.  Our growth strategy is to make accretive acquisitions, grow service center revenues and expand profit margins.

<P>

Through our initial public offering in August, Service Experts raised total net proceeds of $31.3 million.  This equity capital positioned us to begin executing our acquisition strategy, starting with a group of the leading members of Contractor Success Group (CSG), our nationwide association of more than 275 HVAC operators.

<P>

Following the close of the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, we announced the acquisition of 18 service centers, representing annual revenues of approximately $68 million, and more than doubling the Company's revenues on an annualized basis.  In November, we announced the acquisition of five additional companies with annualized revenues of approximately $6 million.  Two of these will become Service Experts service centers and three will be consolidated into existing service centers.  When these transactions close, Service Experts will operate 32 service centers in 16 states.  We expect all of these acquisitions to close by year end subject to customary conditions.

<P>

Because we are a new company formed on August 21, 1996, from the rolling up of 12 HVAC service centers, our historical financial results are not particularly meaningful.  Therefore we report, in addition to the historical results, the following pro forma information which shows results as if the Company and all acquired companies had been combined as of the beginning   of the period presented.

<P>

Pro forma revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, were $16.2 million, and net income was $1.4 million, or $0.17 per share.  The comparison to the prior-year period is affected by several factors, including seasonal weather pattern shifts between the second and third quarters of 1995 and 1996.  We are very pleased with our first quarter of operations and, in particular, with the enthusiastic response we have received from our CSG membership and from our new investors.

<P>

Thank you for your support.

<center><b>SHELTER COMPONENTS CORPORATION <br>
SIGNS LETTER OF INTENT TO SELL ITS CARPET OPERATIONS</center><p>

Elkhart, IN, October 30, 1996,--Shelter Components Corporation (SST-AMEX) </b>announced today that it had signed a "Letter of Intent" to sell the net assets and operations of its carpet manufacturing subsidiary, <u>Danube Carpet Mills, Inc</u>. of Fort Oglethorpe, GA to Dixie Yarns, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXYN) of Chattanooga, Tennessee for $25 million subject to certain adjustments.  Danube's revenues represent approximately $75 million (15%) of Shelter's consolidated net sales, which are anticipated to surpass $500 million in calendar year 1996.  Dixie owns and operates several businesses in the textile and floor covering industries, including Carriage Industries, Inc., which, like Danube, is engaged in the manufacture of carpeting products for the Manufactured Housing, Modular Housing  and Recreational Vehicle industries.
<p>
The sale is subject to regulatory approval, Dixie's due diligence, the two Companies completing a definitive agreement, and approval by Shelter's Board of Directors.  There can be no assurance that an agreement will be executed or that the transaction will be consummated.  The companies anticipate closing the sale on or about December 31, 1996.  Shelter management is currently assessing the various alternative uses of the potential proceeds from such a sale.

<p>
Shelter Components Corporation, operating through its various subsidiaries, is a nationwide distributor of hardware, fasteners, building products, vinyl windows, floor coverings, plumbing, electrical products, and decorative wallboard used principally in the production of manufactured housing, modular housing and recreational vehicles.  Customers are supplied nationally from strategically located regional distribution warehouses in 14 states.  In addition to the Danube carpet and yarn manufacturing operations, the Company  also thermoforms plastic bath products in Michigan and Texas, and laminates decorative wallboard in Indiana, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.</blockquote>

<CENTER><B>SHELTER COMPONENTS CORPORATION<BR>
THIRD QUARTER REPORT<BR>
OCTOBER 22, 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

<B>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:</B>

<P>

     Net sales for the  third quarter ended September 30, 1996 were $139 million and net income was $3.2 million or $.42 per share.  These represent increases of 17% and 11%, respectively, compared with net sales of $119million and net income of $2.9 million or $.38 per share, respectively, for the third quarter of 1995.  
<P>

     For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net sales were $397 million and net income was $8.4 million or $1.08per share, compared to net sales of $345 million and net income of $8.0 million or $1.04 per share for the first nine months of 1995.  The 1996 year-to-date results reflect a 15% increase in net sales and a 5% increase in net income compared to the first nine months of 1995.
   
<P>
 The Manufactured Housing Industry, which represents approximately 75% of the Company's net sales,  reported a 10% increase in homes produced for the first two months of the 3rd quarter of 1996 and a 9.5% increase for the first eight months of 1996 compared to the same periods in 1995.  These increases reflect the ongoing strength of the Manufactured Housing Industry, which continues to outpace site-built housing growth as well as exceeding housing industry analysts expectations for 1996.
 
<P>
    We are pleased with the third quarter results, which when compared to the second quarter of 1996, reflects a modest 1% increase in net sales but a 12% improvement in net income.  Net margins improved to 2.3% of net sales from 1.9% and 2.1% in the 1st and 2nd quarters of 1996, respectively.  Our distribution operations, which represent approximately two-thirds of consolidated net sales, continue to gradually improve their operating efficiencies from one quarter to the next.  1996 is somewhat of a "transition" year for the distribution arm of the Company due to the consolidation of three separate distribution operations at the beginning of the year.  The synergies of that consolidation are being realized and continued improvements are anticipated going forward.  Our manufacturing operations showed improved third quarter results after experiencing some difficulties during the second quarter.
  
<P>
  We also continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support our seasonal working capital fluctuations and also reduce our overall debt.  We have reduced our interest-bearing debt by $5.7 million (68% of net income) during 1996.  In addition to reducing debt, we have reinvested $6 million in capital expenditures thus far in 1996, of which approximately $4.5 million represents the purchase of certain real estate and facilities previously leased.
   
<P>
  We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for the balance of 1996 and for 1997 for our primary market, the Manufactured Housing Industry.  We are particularly excited about the prospects for continuing to improve Shelter's  results because of the various enhancements we are making in 1996 in our infrastructure, which includes management, facilities, systems and processes.
   
<P>
  As always, we thank all of our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders for their continued support and dedication to helping make Shelter Components the premier supplier to the markets we serve.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>SHOE CARNIVAL REPORTS CONTINUED EARNINGS IMPROVEMENTS 
FOR THIRD QUARTER</B></CENTER>

<P>

	Evansville, Indiana, November 21, 1996 -  Shoe Carnival, Inc. (NASDAQ:  SCVL) a leading retailer of value-priced, name brand and private label footwear, today reported significantly improved earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 1996.  Net income increased 247 percent to $2,197,000, or 17 cents per share from $634,000, or 05 cents per share recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 1995.

<P>

	Net sales for the third quarter ended November 2, 1996 increased 6 percent to $63.9 million from last year’s $60.2 million.  Comparable store sales during the quarter rose 3 percent. Comparable store sales results exclude in both years the sales generated by seven stores the Company closed in the first nine months of 1996 and an additional store which is expected to be closed during the remainder of 1996.

<P>

	Gross profit margins improved to 29.8 percent in the third quarter, compared with 27.1 percent in the third quarter last year.  Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of sales, decreased to 23.6 percent in the third quarter from 24.6 percent last year, primarily due to the positive effect of the increase in net sales and lower advertising costs.

<P>

	Net income for the first nine months of 1996 increased 160 percent to $4,009,000, or 31 cents per share from $1,542,000, or 12 cents per share last year.  Net sales increased 5 percent to $179.7 million for the first nine months from sales of $170.7 million last year.  Comparable store sales declined 2 percent for the nine month period.

<P>

	Wayne Weaver, Chairman said, "We are pleased to report the substantial increase in Shoe Carnival’s earnings, which was again driven primarily from the increase in gross profit margins.  Unlike recent quarters, however, we are starting to see a more favorable trend in comparable store sales.  This is especially satisfying given the significant decline in inventories over the past year.  Total inventories are down more than 7 percent despite operating two more stores relative to the end of the third quarter last year."

<P>

	During the third quarter, the Company opened a new store in Cape Girardeau, MO,  and closed a store in Birmingham, AL.
	
<P>

	Mr. Weaver concluded, "Our management team, under the direction of  new president Mark Lemond, continues to make positive changes that have resulted in improving fundamentals of Shoe Carnival’s business.  Although we remain cautious in our planning due to the extremely competitive retail environment, we expect to see these improvements continue into next year."

<P>

	Shoe Carnival is a chain of 93 footwear stores located in the Midwest and Midsouth.  Combining value pricing with carnival-like entertainment, Shoe Carnival is a leading retailer of name brand and private label footwear for the entire family.  Headquartered in Evansville, IN, Shoe Carnival trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol SCVL.

<a name="letter"><h3>Letter to Shareholders:</h3></a>

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:  I am pleased to report that Shorewood Packaging's quarterly revenues and earnings for its second quarter of fiscal 1996 ended October 28, 1995.  Revenues for the quarter were $105,120,000 as compared to $97,050,000 for the corresponding period last year, an increase of 8.3%.  Earnings from operations for the quarter were $12,066,000 as compared to $13,419,000 in the prior period, a decrease of 10.1%.  Net earnings for the quarter amounted to $6,282,000 ($0.32 per share) as compared to net earnings of $6,769,000 ($0.36 per share) for the corresponding prior period, a decrease of 7.2%.  Weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter increased from 18,920,000 to 19,899,000.

<P>

Revenues for the six-month period ending October 28, 1995 were $195,819,000 as compared to $181,823,000 for the prior period, an increase of 7.7%.  Earnings from operations for the six-month period ended October 28, 1995 were $23,424,000 as compared to $24,409,000 for the prior period, a decrease of 4.0%.  Net income for the six-month period ended October 28, 1995 was $12,143,000 ($0.61 per share) as compared to $12,237,000 ($0.66 per share) for the prior period, a decrease of 0.8%.

<P>

Our Company's results for the second fiscal quarter were mixed.  On a positive note, revenue growth continued to be robust as demonstrated by record sales in this, the first quarter in our history to reach sales in excess of $100,000,000.  However, we had a disappointing quarter with respect to the operating margin achieved by our Company.  Although raw material costs were certainly a factor, the preponderance of our decrease in operating margin was due to manufacturing inefficiencies experienced at one of our major facilities.  We have taken action to correct the problems at that facility, and expect to see improvement throughout the balance of the year.

<P>

I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  2 million additional shares of the Company's common stock, which, together with a previous Board resolution, now authorizes the Company to purchase approximately 2.5 million shares.  As we look to the future, we see significant opportunities for our Company.  We expect our core business to continue to grow throughout the balance of fiscal 1996 and beyond, and expect a meaningful revenue contribution from our new manufacturing facility in Springfield, Oregon, to begin during the latter part of fiscal 1996.  In addition, as indicated earlier, we hope to achieve improvement in our operating margins.  As a result, our Board and our management believe the long-term outlook for the Company to be promising and that the Company's common stock represents an attractive investment opportunity.  The purchases will be made from time to time, as market conditions permit.

<P>

To effectuate its Board's authorization to repurchase its common stock, the Company has entered into a new senior credit facility.  The new agreement increases the amount available under Shorewood's credit facilities by approximately $41 million to $185 million, extends the final maturity of the facilities by one year to May, 2000, and permits the purchase of up to $40 million of the Company's common stock subject to the terms of the credit agreement.    In connection with the  new credit agreement, the Company will record in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 a one-time extraordinary charge of $1,400,000 (after related income tax benefits of $900,000) representing a write-off of deferred finance costs incurred in connection with the former agreement.

<P>

It is with great personal sadness that I inform you that my father, Paul Shore, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Shorewood, passed away on December 10, 1995.  My father was my mentor, my partner and so much more.  His integrity, generosity and brilliance influenced my career at Shorewood since I began working here in 1976.

<P>

Our entire company  deeply mourns the loss of our founder.  The following words placed in The Wall Street Journal by the 2700 employees of Shorewood perhaps best express Paul Shore's legacy to us all: "His reputation as a successful packaging pioneer, innovator and entrepreneur was exceeded only by his ability to inspire and befriend thousands of people whose lives he touched."  

<P>

On January 25, 1996 the Board of Directors elected me as Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer.  At the same meeting, the Board elected Howard M. Liebman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Shorewood, as a director, to fill a vacancy on our Board of Directors.

<P>

I am confident that our Company has a great future.  We have a strong foundation to build on, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.

<P>

<CENTER><B>SIGNAL TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES EARNINGS GROWTH ON RECORD HIGH SALES FOR THIRD QUARTER</B></CENTER>

<P>

<U>Sunnyvale, California (October 21, 1996),</U> SIGNAL TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (AMEX: STZ) announced today financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 1996.

<P>

For the second quarter in a row, the Company reports record high sales.  Third quarter sales were $31.6 million, up 42% from $22.3 million in third quarter 1995.  Net income rose 69% for the quarter to $995,000 or $0.13 per share, compared to $589,000 or $0.08 per share for the third quarter of 1995.  Sales for nine months of 1996 were $81.0 million, up from $65.8 million for the first nine months of 1995.  Earnings totaled $1.0 million or $0.13 per share for the first nine months of 1996, compared to a loss of $29,000 for the same period last year.  Backlog for the quarter ended at $93.8 million on bookings of $21.7 million.  

<P>

Earnings improvement can be attributed to higher sales from key development programs entering full rate production.  "Our Keltec operation is leading this recovery with strong shipments, key foreign contract wins and an energized management team," stated Dale Peterson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Signal Technology.  "We expect margin improvement throughout the remainder of 1996.  As we enter 1997, we intend to grow through additional acquisitions, further penetration in the space market and new customers for our established products," said Peterson.

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:
</B>
<P>
In the second quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company continued to see strong demand for our products.  Record bookings of $193,541,000 represented an increase of 20% over second quarter fiscal 1995 bookings of $161,270,000.  The Company continues to focus on improving results and continues to make progress in reducing cycle time of its Micrascan lithography tool.   We are encouraged by the continued growth of the   Company’s  bookings  even   though  the  Company 
has received requests for delays for shipments from certain customers.  Progress continues to be made in the implementation of our lithography strategy, and SVG Lithography has recorded additional orders for its .25 micron machine, Micrascan III.  The Company recorded a Book-to-Bill ratio of 1.13 and ended the quarter with a backlog of $441,283,000.
<P>
Sales of $170,668,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 represented a 56% increase over sales of $109,380,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 1995, and an 8% increase over sales of $158,280,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Sales of $328,948,000 for the six months ended March 31, 1996, represented a 68% increase over sales of $195,351,000 for the corresponding period in fiscal 1995.

<P>

Net income of $17,653,000, or $.58 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 1996 increased over net income of $7,487,000, or $.33 per share, and $16,481,000, or $.54 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 1995 and the first quarter of fiscal 1996, respectively.  Net income for the six months ended March 31, 1996, of $34,134,000, or $1.12 per share, increased 166% over net income of $12,817,000, or $.58 per share, for the corresponding six month period in fiscal 1995.

<P>

The Company attributed the increase in earnings in the second quarter of fiscal 1996 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 1995 to increased sales and improved operating performance in each of the operating units of the Company.  Comparing the second quarter of fiscal 1996 to the first quarter of fiscal 1996, the increase in earnings was attributed to higher sales and improved performance in the Company’s Thermco division.

<P>

As the semiconductor industry moves through the current period of uncertainty, SVG will continue to make strategic investments in new technology products, cautiously invest in infrastructure and expand manufacturing capacity in our lithography operation.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Shareholder's Update
</H3>
<P>


Dear Shareholder,
<P>


This letter is to provide you with a brief update on the progress that <B><I>Silver Standard Resources</I></B> - a company in which our records
show you to be a shareholder - is making
towards its goal of becoming a major entity in the global silver mining community within the next few years.We will also tell you how you can  keep closely in touch with your investment now and in the future.
<P>

<B>
Profiting from the Pending Silver Turnaround</B>

<P>

Due to the dramatic silver deficit of the past seven years, a deficit which has seen new supply fall short of demand by as much as 200,000,000 ounces a year, silver stockpiles are approaching depletion. As a result, we believe a major turning point for silver will be reached within the foreseeable future. It is the company's mandate to aggressively secure new reserves at current low prices in order to optimize gains for shareholders once the long silver bear market comes to an end.
The company is well on its way to meeting its near-term goal of securing 250,000,000 ounces in proven silver resources by year-end 1997,  thanks to five highly prospective properties in its portfolio. Each of these properties holds a minimum resource potential of 20 million ounces of silver. Two, in particular,  have the potential for far larger resources. These include... 
<P>

<B> <I>El Asiento</I></B>, located in Southwestern Bolivia near Cerro Rico, the world’s largest silver mine. The El Asiento property could contain as much as 100 million to 200 million ounces of silver. Silver Standard's current plans call for an aggressive $5 million,  two-year program to fully delineate the size and caliber of this resource. 
<P>

The<B><I> Lunnoe and Arylach</I> </B>deposits, located on an exploration license in the Russian Far East, are estimated to contain 160,000,000 ounces of silver and 500,000 ounces of gold. As Silver Standard has the rights to acquire 46% of the owner of the concession, the company's potential share represents approximately 80 million ounces of silver and 250,000 ounces of gold.
At this writing, a bankable feasibility study which includes an exhaustive evaluation of the economic potential of the Lunnoe and Arylach properties is being prepared for release by October, 1996. Depending on the results of this study, the company anticipates taking these properties into production in 1998. 
<P>

In addition, Silver Standard's property acquisition team is currently reviewing a number of properties in Mexico, Bolivia and Peru. Among these properties is Cerro Rico, the world’s largest silver producer,  which will soon be put up for auction as  part of a Bolivian government privatization initiative. Silver Standard will use its considerable resources - which includes US$10 million in the treasury - to  pursue this property aggressively.

<P>

<B>How to Stay in Touch</B>

<P>

To keep our shareholders closely in touch during this exciting period, we have prepared a comprehensive <I><B>Corporate Profile</B></I> which is available by calling 1-800-379-1085. When you call, you can also sign-up to receive fax or mail updates on new developments as they occur.

<P>

As our records indicate your shares are registered only in "street name," it is important for you to call that number if you wish to receive special updates on Silver Standard's progress towards becoming one of the world's most significant silver resource companies.

<P>

Thank you for you continued support and interest. We look forward to being in touch again soon.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>Third Quarter Report to Shareholders</B>
<P>

<I>As reported in the October 21, 1996, earnings release</I></CENTER>

<P>

	Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. (the "Company") announced today that its 1996 third quarter net income was $6,392,770 on sales of $57,128,574 as compared to net income of $4,727,370 on sales of $47,069,601 for the third quarter of 1995. Net income per common share increased 31.7% from $0.41 for the third quarter of 1995 to $0.54 for the third quarter of 1996.
<P>

	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, net income was $14,823,123 on sales of  $152,345,631, while for the same period in the prior year, the Company had net income of $11,029,407 on sales of $124,706,784. Net income per common share increased 29.9% from $0.97 for the first nine months of 1995 to
  $1.26 for the same period in 1996.
<P>

 	Sales increased 21.4% from the third quarter of 1995 to the third quarter of 1996. The increase reflected solid growth throughout the United States, although, sales in California increased at a rate slower than the average growth rate. Simpson Strong-Tie’s sales increased 23.8% while Simpson Dura-Vent’s sales increased 13.4%. Sales to dealer distributors were the fastest growing connector sales channel, while contractor distributor and homecenter sales growth slowed somewhat. The sales growth rate of engineered wood products and seismic and high wind products led Simpson Strong-Tie sales with above average increases, while Simpson Dura-Vent sales of Direct-Vent products, sold both to OEMs and through distributors, continued to experience strong growth. Third quarter sales were also positively influenced by sales at the businesses acquired in the second half of 1995. The acquisitions during the last year accounted for 1.6% of the Company’s 1996 third quarter sales.
	
<P>
Income from operations increased 40.7% from $7,621,797 in the third quarter of 1995 to $10,724,722 in the third quarter of 1996. This increase was primarily due to higher gross margins, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Selling expenses increased 23.2% in total from $4,001,779 in the third quarter of 1995 to $4,929,448 in the third quarter of 1996. General and administrative expenses increased 28.5% from $5,472,251 in the third quarter of 1995 to $7,033,766 in the third quarter of 1996. This increase was primarily due to increased cash profit sharing, as a result of higher operating profit, and higher personnel and other overhead costs. Interest income increased to $175,048 in the third quarter of 1996 as a result of the increased cash balances. The effective tax rate increased from 38.2% in the third quarter of 1995 to 41.4% in the third quarter of 1996, primarily due to the recognition of lower effective state tax rates in the third quarter of 1995.
	
<P>
In October, Simpson Strong-Tie’s quality management system was recommended for ISO9000 registration by a third party registration organization. Simpson Strong-Tie is the Company’s largest subsidiary and, to the Company’s knowledge, no other U.S. company in the connector industry has been ISO9000 registered. Management believes that this recommendation reflects the Company’s on-going commitment to quality.
	
<P>
The Company has committed to purchase or has leased additional space to increase its capacity. Simpson Strong-Tie has expanded its research and development and marketing support facilities by leasing a 48,000 square foot building in San Leandro, California, and has moved its Jacksonville, Florida, warehouse into a new leased facility with approximately twice the square footage of its old facility. The planned expansion of the company owned warehouse in McKinney, Texas, has commenced. This expansion will add approximately 60,000 square feet to the existing structure. In addition, the Company has agreed to purchase a 30,500 square foot building which it currently leases from an unrelated party at its facility in Brea, California.<P>

For the first quarter ended July 31, 1996, sales were $134,154,000, up slightly from $133,897,000 for the same period last year.  Net income for the quarter was $7,489,000 or $.26 per share compared to $9,524,000  or $.33 per share last year.  All amounts exclude the effect of the discontinued Mrs. Smith's operations.

<P>

Sales increased in the Foodservice, Industrial, International, and Specialty Foods business areas.  The Foodservice area recorded the largest dollar gain, based primarily on continued growth in sales of  portion control items.   Consumer area sales were down approximately 3% from the first quarter of last year due to declines in sales of fruit spreads and dessert toppings.  This was offset somewhat by increased sales of peanut butter as the Company continued the introduction of its reduced fat peanut butter products.  Sales also were down slightly from last year in the Beverage area due in part to a continued shortage of raw materials for organic juice products.  
 
<P>

Income from continuing operations decreased approximately 20% from last year, primarily due to increased marketing expenditures in support of the Company's fruit spread business.  Also contributing to the earnings decrease was a general increase in the cost of fruit raw materials and increases in administrative expenditures.  The increase in administrative costs was related to spending in support of the Company's Appleseed strategic planning project (see the discussion below in the post-meeting report). 

<P>

<B>Dividend</B>

<P>

If you are a shareholder of record and your dividends are not entirely reinvested in our Dividend Reinvestment Service, there is enclosed with this report a check representing a dividend of  $.13 per share on each Class A and Class B Common Share, payable September 3, 1996, to shareholders of record on August 30, 1996.

<B>Annual Meeting Post-Meeting Report</B>

<P>

The 1996 annual meeting of shareholders was held on Tuesday, August 13, 1996, in Wooster, Ohio.  The highlights of the meeting included the election of four directors to new three-year terms and a presentation by members of senior management in which they discussed a new strategy project undertaken by the Company and outlined some of the directions that the business will take in the future based on the project and resulting strategic plan.

<P>

Tim Smucker, Chairman of the Company, and Richard Smucker, President, made the joint presentation and noted in their opening remarks the importance of a compelling growth strategy in generating shareholder value.  They then reviewed for the audience the Company's "Appleseed" project, which was initiated in the autumn of 1995.  Tim Smucker described the Appleseed project as a "major initiative to mobilize the entire Company in pursuit of our objectives of growth and profitability," and noted that the  project has helped the Company to identify the consumer directions that it will be emphasizing in the future. 

<P>

In discussing these directions, Mr. Smucker described them in terms of three strategic dimensions.  With regard to the first dimension, Mr. Smucker said that the Company will seek ways to make its products "Easy for You" by bringing to its consumers products that are more convenient for them to buy and to use.  It also will seek to appeal to consumers  on a "Good and Good For You" dimension by using its fruit formulation knowledge and capabilities to bring together foods that taste good and foods that are good for you.  Finally, the Company will "Make You Smile" by trying in everything it does to provide enjoyment for consumers and to support and enhance the image of the Smucker's brand.

<P>

In concluding his comments on the strategic direction of the Company, Tim Smucker stated that,  "It is our intent to bring joy to every eating experience by becoming the company that people trust worldwide for fruit-based and other complementary solutions."  He stressed what he saw as the Company's unique strengths, including a brand with a 100-year-old reputation for quality and value combined with an unparalleled knowledge of fruit and related ingredients.  He also observed that the intent will be realized by encouraging  independent thought, initiative, and diversity among the employees of the Company. 
  
<P>

In his portion of the presentation, Richard Smucker discussed some of the consumer trends that have been important to the Company in the past.  He noted that much of the Company's past growth has come from products developed to address an identified consumer trend or need, and reviewed the growth over the past ten years that has come 
in response to changing consumer needs in business areas such as foodservice and industrial.  He also discussed some of the current and future trends identified as part of the Appleseed project that the Company expects to be important as it implements its strategy.  In that regard, he observed that the Company, with its expertise in producing wide varieties of wholesome and healthy products, is ideally suited to capitalize on many of these trends.  

<P>

The comments on trends were followed by a review of some of the new  initiatives that the Company expects to help provide future growth and meet strategic goals.  According to Tim Smucker, the initiatives under consideration have been selected because they  meet one or more of the following specific criteria:  build upon existing brands; venture into new and growing categories; use proprietary technology; capitalize on changes in consumer eating habits; bring new ideas to old habits; or build upon natural alliances.

<P>

Among the specific examples of  new initiatives coming out of Appleseed that were discussed was the Company's new <I>Baking Healthy</I> product, a fruit-based, fat-free replacement for oil and shortening for use in baking.  Also included in the review were reduced fat, natural-style peanut butters,  Knudsen & Sons' <I>Simply Nutritious</I> line of juices, and brand extension opportunities such as the license to Brach & Brock for the development of a line of  jelly beans and other confection items cobranded with both the <I>Smucker's</I> and <I>Brach's</I> trademarks.

<P>

In his comments concerning the management presentation, Paul Smucker, Chairman of the Company's executive committee, noted that the new initiatives arising out of Appleseed will require substantial investment over the next several years to make them a reality.  He also observed that those investments have already begun and their effect on earnings would be reflected in the Company's first quarter  results.

<P>

In the regular business of the meeting, 12,814,881 Class A Common Shares (or approximately 89%) were represented in person or by proxy.  The shares so represented were entitled to cast 67,633,882 votes at the meeting, representing 92% of the voting power of the Company.  The shareholders reelected the following four people to new terms on the Company's Board of Directors:  Lena C. Bailey, Robert R. Morrison, Paul H. Smucker, and William Wrigley, Jr.  The shareholders also ratified the audit committee's appointment of Ernst & Young, LLP, as the Company's independent auditors for the 1997 fiscal year.

<P>

Following the management presentation and a brief question and answer session, the meeting was adjourned at 12 noon.

Nine-Month Sales, Earnings and Earnings per Share</H2></CENTER>

<P>
 Snap-on Incorporated announced record third quarter and nine-month sales, earnings and earnings per share for 1996.     

<P>

Third quarter net sales were $347.2 million, compared with $309.1 million in the third quarter of 1995, an increase of 12.3 percent.  Net earnings for the quarter increased to $30.8 million, versus $26.3 million in the same period a year ago.  Per share earnings were $.51, compared with $.43 in the third quarter a year ago, an increase of 18.6 percent.   

<P>

Net sales for the first nine months of 1996 reached a record $1.076 billion, compared with $945.0 million for the first nine months of 1995, an increase of 13.9 percent.  Net earnings rose to $94.9 million, versus $82.5 million in the same period a year ago. Earnings per share were $1.56, compared with $1.33 for the first nine months of 1995, an increase of 17.3 percent.   

<P>

The third quarter’s results benefited from several focused acquisitions, higher U.S. dealer van channel sales, and strong sales growth in the company’s European segment.  The quarter’s performance also reflects continuing improvements in operating efficiencies, as expenses as a percent of net sales declined to 40.7 percent from 41.8 percent in the same year-ago period.   

<P>

Distribution of shares in connection with the 3-for-2 split of Snap-on’s common stock was made on September 10, 1996.  All share-related amounts in this report reflect that split.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>SOFTWARE ARTISTRY REPORTS THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

<B> Indianapolis, IN</B> --- Software Artistry, Inc. (Nasdaq:SWRT), today announced results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1996. 
<P>

Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 1996, were $8.3 million, up 28% from $6.4 million in the third quarter of 1995, with per share earnings, on a fully diluted basis, of $.04 in 1996  compared with $.12 in 1995. For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, revenues were $21.9 million, a 33% increase over $16.4 million for the same period last year, with net earnings per share of $.03 for the first nine months of 1996 (which includes a second quarter 1996 severance charge of $.02) compared to net income per share of $.28 for the first nine months of 1995.
<P>

"We are pleased with the progress that we have made in the past quarter. We surpassed our financial goals, while also achieving the desired results from our increased investment in  development efforts," stated W. Scott Webber, President and CEO. "During the quarter, we released SA-Expert Web™, believed to be the industry’s first true forward-deployment solution for an organization’s end-user support needs." 
<P>

"Software Artistry also is on track to deliver an enhanced version of its flagship product, Expert Advisor, in the fourth quarter," Webber said. "The product is the centerpiece of our software suite designed to enable corporations to set up automated Enterprise Support Management operations. This new version of Expert Advisor will provide a three-tiered client/server architecture to enhance enterprise-level scalability for an organization’s distributed worldwide support operations. These features were initially planned for Version 4.0 (slated for release in early 1997); however, we accelerated their development schedule. In addition, our application designed for the rapidly growing customer support market, called Expert Support, is on schedule for delivery in the fourth quarter of 1996 or the first quarter of 1997.  We also announced Version 2.0 of SA-ExpertView™, which integrates network and systems management platforms to the support center and which is expected to release in the first quarter of 1997," he added.
<P>

"We continue to experience strong revenue growth from our European operations," added Webber. During the third quarter, Software Artistry licensed its complete suite of products to CSC Computer Sciences Limited for its European operations. "We were selected based on the full suite of products we provide for Enterprise Support Management," said Webber. 
<P>

Software Artistry also welcomed three new organizations into its Expert Partners Program as value-added resellers during the quarter. Global Management Systems, Inc. covers the United 
 States and Canada, while RFD & Associates and Red Sky Technologies will focus in the Southwest and Great Lakes regions, respectively.  These new partnerships demonstrate Software Artistry’s expansion into different market segments such as the entry-level and workgroup help desk, asset management, and change management operations. 
<P>
  
Regarding the Company’s outlook, Webber concluded, "Our major opportunity lies in expanding beyond the Internal Help Desk market to Total Customer Care - a significantly larger market that is growing more rapidly. We plan to broaden our product offering and expand our distribution channels. With a renewed focus on development and implementation, we are on track to deliver a number of exciting new products and major enhancements. We are investing in additional client services, including greater support from Systems Engineers. Backed by a strong balance sheet, our strategic initiatives are geared toward delivering quality products on a timely basis and raising the market awareness of Software Artistry."
<P>

Under a previously authorized share repurchase program, the Company repurchased 102,500 shares during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date repurchases to 242,500 shares. Earlier this month, Software Artistry announced plans for a new corporate facility to accommodate  growth.  The State of Indiana and the City of Indianapolis are jointly providing an incentive package which could total in excess of  $10 million. The move-in date is targeted for January of 1998.
<P>

This press release includes forward looking information that is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, especially with respect to product releases, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Among these risks and uncertainties are various important factors, including without limitation competitive actions in the marketplace, technological innovations, and the size and timing of individual license transactions. Furthermore, the timing of new product releases is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience delays with respect to the release of new products or that such releases will gain market acceptance. Further information on potential factors which could affect financial results are included in the Company’s Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995.
<P>

Software Artistry, Inc. is recognized as a leader in providing strategic, automated support solutions for large and medium-sized organizations in a wide range of industries. The Company develops, markets, and supports the SA-EXPERTISE suite of software applications for customer service and support    operations.

<b>Fiscal 1997 Second Quarter Report</b>
<p>
To Our Shareholders
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Net sales for the quarter ended September 30, 1996, were $181,891,000. This represents an increase of 103% over net sales for the same period one year ago and reflects the impact of the Company’s recent acquisitions. As you may recall, earlier this year the Company acquired the corporate, government and education (CGE) division of Egghead, Inc., and a technology services company in Asia/Pacific, the Essentially Group. For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, the Company realized a net loss of $533,000, or $.12 per share, which primarily reflects the impact of identifiable transition costs of approximately $1,400,000 incurred in connection with these acquisitions. During the September quarter, we completed the installation of our information systems and telephone systems in our Spokane call center and transferred the servicing of all former Egghead CGE customers from Egghead fulfillment to our systems and distribution centers. We also began the consolidation of administrative functions to our multilingual operations center for Asia/Pacific located in Sydney, Australia.
<P>
 I am pleased to report that today all Software Spectrum customers are being serviced by our people, on our systems and from our distribution facilities. The conclusion of the most crucial aspects of the transition period represents a pivotal point for the Company. We now expect to see profitability improve over the remainder of the fiscal year as we begin to realize the operational efficiencies of our larger organization. In October, Software Spectrum launched our new Web site. Designed in conjunction with Microsoft, our Web site catalogs will serve four major market segments: commercial; US government, US education and consumer markets. The most exciting aspect of our new Web site is our ability to create individual customer-specific catalogs within our site. Customers can be provided with a secure, organization-specific, online custom catalog including their pricing and volume licensing information, as well as product search, order placement and research capabilities.
<P>
 Software Spectrum’s Internet expertise enables us to further maximize existing and emerging electronic commerce technologies to support our customers, and reduce their total cost of PC ownership.
<P>
 I am also pleased to announce the appointment of Carl S. Ledbetter Jr. to the Company’s Board of D i r e c t o r s . Mr. Ledbetter is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hybrid Networks, an innovator and leader in the broadband access industry. His expertise in electronic commerce, the networking industry, and the Internet provides the Company with valuable experience on our Board.
<P>
 This has been a very productive quarter for Software Spectrum. With the most significant part of our transition period behind us, we can now focus on managing a much larger business. We believe we are well positioned for the future with a very complete offering, both in terms of servicing capabilities and worldwide presence. Thank you for your continued support.

<CENTER><B>First Quarter Fiscal 1997 Results</B><BR>
Dear Solectron Shareholders:
</CENTER><P>
We completed the first quarter of fiscal 1997 with record sales of $808 million, up 17% from the first quarter of fiscal 1996. Net income for the quarter, inclusive of a one-time, pre-tax charge of $4 million for the transaction costs associated with the merger with Force Computers Inc., was $31.5 million, up 15% from the first quarter of fiscal 1996. Fully diluted earnings per share for the period were $0.58, reflecting approximately $0.05 per share in non-recurring charges. Earnings from operations, without giving effect to the non-recurring charges, would have been $34.1 million, or $0.63 per share, also setting records.
<P> 
The company’s results of operations for the first quarter include four days of Force Computers Inc. operating results. The Company has decided not to restate prior periods’ results on a combined basis because restating would not have a material impact on any prior period’s earnings.
<P>
Demand for our services fueled Solectron’s continued expansion. In October, we announced the opening of a Solectron facility in the Boston, Massachusetts area to serve the needs of customers who desire our electronics manufacturing services in the northeastern United States. This location will offer Solectron assembly services and also provide prototype manufacturing services via our Fine Pitch Technology, Inc. subsidiary. On November 26, 1996, Solectron completed the merger with Force Computers Inc., a designer and manufacturer of systems and boards for embedded VMEbus applications. This merger strengthens our ability to provide design services to customers who desire pre-manufacturing services. On December 9, we announced the opening of Solectron (Suzhou) Technology, Co., Ltd., in Suzhou, China. This facility will begin offering manufacturing services by the third quarter of fiscal 1997.
<P>
In early September, Solectron Technology, Sdn. Bhd., our subsidiary located in Penang, Malaysia, was selected as the 1996 winner of the Malaysian Quality Management Excellence Award. And in October, our subsidiary, Solectron Technology, Inc. in Charlotte, North Carolina, was named the winner of the 1996 North Carolina Quality Leadership Award. These two honors reflect the corporation’s commitment to continuous improvement in all phases of our operations.
<P>
On September 16, I was honored to be elected as Chairman of Solectron’s Board of Directors. I would like to thank outgoing chairman Charles A. Dickinson for his commitment and dedication to Solectron and I am delighted that he will continue to serve as a member of our Board of Directors. 
<P>
In summary, I am pleased with the company’s first quarter performance. Thank you for your past support and I look forward to your continued confidence in Solectron.
<P>
Yours truly,
     </BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Dear Shareholders:

<P>

	The third quarter of 1996 was indeed busy.  In addition to posting record earnings, we also acquired $23 million of new storage facilities, negotiated a larger and less expensive line of credit, and undertook a secondary stock offering that provided the Company with a net $77 million in proceeds.

<P>

	Properties in both new and previously existing markets have performed well, with the facilities in the Northeast and Ohio posting the strongest gains.  We expect strong occupancies and good rate growth through the balance of the year.

<P>

	We now own and operate 109 self-storage properites, an increase of 35 facilities since our Initial Public Offering fifteen months ago.  We are pleased with all of these acquisitions, and intend to improve upon this acquisition trend as we grow into the coming year.

	At September 30, 1996 the average occupancy of the 109 facilities was 90.1%, a significant increase from 88.2% for the same period in 1995.  Total revenues for the third quarter of 1996 were $9,034,448, an increase of 42.4% over the third quarter of 1995.  Third quarter net operating income in 1996 was $6,524,704, an improvement of 38.9% over 1995’s third quarter.  Same store sales improved by 5.8% over the same period last year, and net operating income improved 5.3% on a same store basis.

<P>

<U>Portfolio Growth</U><BR>
	The Company acquired nine facilities during the quarter.  Seven were in markets where the Company already has operations:  two in Charlotte, NC; three in Jacksonville, FL; and one each in the Washington, DC and Pittsburgh, PA markets.  Performance of the properties in these cities is expected to be enhanced by the additional sites, as market presence can be strenghtened through group advertising and cross-referrals.  The Company also entered two new markets - Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio.  With the acquisition of the 9 properties, the Company now owns and manages 109 facilities in 15 states.  Over 50,000 units comprising a total of 5.7 million sq. ft. of rentable space is available for lease.

<P>

<U>Financing</U><BR>
	During the quarter, the Company negotiated to expand its credit line from $45 million to $75 million, and to reduce the interest rate from LIBOR plus 2.6% to LIBOR plus 1.9%.  The term of the agreement was extended from June, 1997 to August, 1998.  At September 30, 1996, the Company had borrowed $59 million pursuant to this Credit Line.

<P>

<U>Common Stock Offering</U><BR>
	On September 26, the Company successfully completed a secondary equity offering, selling 3,162,500 additional shares of common stock at a price of $26 per share.  The net proceeds of approximately $77 million  were received on October 1, 1996 and were used to repay the outstanding line of credit balance in its entirety.  The remaining $14 million is available to fund the purchase of fourth quarter acquisitions.

<P>

<U>Dividends</U><BR>
	On September 4, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend increase of 3%  from $.505 per share to $.52 per share to shareholders of record at October 8, 1996.  The dividend was paid on October 23, 1996.

 <BLOCKQUOTE>


To Our Valued Shareholders:


<P>

	I am pleased to announce your company’s sales and record earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 1996.
<P>

	Earnings for the second quarter of 1996 were $1.8 million or $0.45 per share — a record high in company quarterly earnings.  The second quarter results represent a 15% increase over the comparable quarter in 1995, during which we earned $1.6 million or $0.39 per share.
<P>

	Net sales for the second quarter were $26.1 million, versus $31.9 million for the comparable 1995 quarter.  Sales in our office products line were $12.7 million, compared to $16.2 million for the second quarter in 1995.  Our saturated specialties product line posted $9.0 million in sales, versus $10.5 million during the second quarter of 1995.  Book cover material sales were $3.9 million, compared to sales of $3.5 million in the second quarter of 1995.  The remaining $0.5 million in quarterly sales related to toll produced gasket products.
<P>

	For the six-month period ended June 30, 1996, net sales were $50.9 million compared to $67.1 million for the first six months of 1995. Our gasket business, which was sold in March of 1995, accounts for $6.1 million of this decline.  Earnings for the six-month period were $2.9 million or $0.71 per share compared to earnings of $3.2 million or $0.79 per share for the comparable period in 1995.  Results for 1995 are adjusted to exclude non-recurring and extraordinary items.
<P>

	Order patterns have been somewhat erratic, but are now beginning to show a more consistent upward trend as we close the second quarter.  There has also been some reduction in the prices of market pulp and secondary fiber during the first half of 1996 and our cost structure has benefited accordingly.  We are optimistic that the second half of 1996 will benefit from a continuance of both of these trends.
<P>

	I look forward to reporting to you again in October on our third quarter results.  As always, we thank you for your continued support. 


<P>

Sincerely,



<P>

<P>

<B>To Our Shareholders:</B>
<P>

The Spectranetics Corporation (NASDAQ: SPNC), which manufactures the world’s only laser for cardiovascular use, market-released by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, reported financial results for the quarter and nine months ending September 30, 1996 on October 17, 1996.  Highlights for the period included:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>A 29 percent increase</B> in revenue over the same period last year.  Third quarter revenue totaled $5.6 million compared to $4.3 million a year ago.  
<LI><B>Revenue exceeding $15.7 million</B> for the nine-month period ending Sept. 30 is a 20-percent increase from the $13.0 million recorded over the same period in 1995.  
</UL>
<P>
 
The increases are due primarily to growing sales of its laser catheters for use in coronary angioplasty and clinical trial usage.  Current trials are utilizing the Company’s laser sheath for the removal of pacemaker lead wires and the Prima® wire for opening totally occluded arteries.  
<P>

<B>Progress on the laser sheath trial</B> should allow the Company to file a PMA application requesting expedited FDA approval during 4th Quarter 1996.  Application has been made for European regulatory approval (CE mark) for the laser sheath.
<P>

"Continued enhancements in our laser catheters and the investigation of new treatment areas have combined to improve marketplace acceptance of our products," said Wyatt Cannady, Spectranetics’ president and CEO.  

<P><UL>
<LI><B>The loss for the quarter of $69,000 ($0.00 per share) is an improvement</B> over a $418,000 loss ($0.02 per share) in the third quarter of 1995.  The reduced loss reflects continued aggressive cost control measures, improvements in operating efficiency and growing acceptance of the Company’s products. Similarly, the loss for the nine months ended Sept. 30 was $1.0 million as compared to a $1.8 million loss recorded during the same period in 1995.
<LI><B>Gross margins improved to 50 percent</B> in the third quarter of 1996, as compared with 44 percent in the third quarter 1995.  
<LI><B>Cash, cash equivalents and securities</B> at Sept. 30, 1996 totaled $7.1 million.  The Company generated positive cash flows of $403,000 for third quarter 1996, and $64,000 through the first three quarters of this year.  
</UL>
<P>

<B>In line with Company expectations,</B> Spectranetics’ operating expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ending Sept. 30 increased $472,000 (19 percent) and $923,000 (12 percent), respectively, as compared to the same periods in 1995.  
<P>

"These increases are consistent with the Company’s performance, and are due largely to product development and clinical support costs from our ongoing clinical trials," Cannady said.
Information contained in this report, other than historical information, should be considered forward-looking and may be subject to risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.   Actual results may be affected by, among other things, risks and uncertainties related to new product development cycles, research and development activities, regulatory approvals of new products, new product introductions and market acceptance of new products, introduction of competitive products by others, third-party reimbursement, physician training, and other factors including those set forth from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995.
<P>

The Spectranetics Corporation develops, manufactures and markets a proprietary excimer laser, the CVX-300®, and proprietary disposable fiber optic delivery systems to treat cardiovascular disease.  Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Polymicro Technologies, Inc., is a manufacturer of drawn silica glass products.

<CENTER><B>Spectrian Announces Second Quarter Results - Revised<BR>
December 13, 1996</B></CENTER>
<P>


Dear Spectrian Shareholders:
<P>


	On November 21, 1996 we mailed out this announcement, but it contained several typographical errors in the financial statements below.  This is a revised announcement.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
<P>


	Revenues for the second fiscal 1997 quarter ended September 28, 1996 reached  $22.3 million, up 6% from a year ago, and up 124% from last quarter.  A net loss of $336,000, or $.04 per share, resulted for the quarter, compared with a profit of $2.5 million and $.29 per share a year ago, but an improvement from a loss of $5.3 million or $.66 per share in the prior quarter.  

<P>

	Our increased revenues were driven by a stronger than expected order recovery by our largest customer as well as production ramp of our new PCS CDMA product.  Despite this increased revenue, gross margin of 24% (down from 35% a year ago) reflected the high costs associated with more than doubling our revenue from  the prior quarter and the production start up of six new products.

<P>

	Spectrian has made the strategic decision that, in the near term, we will focus on revenue growth and customer and market diversification rather than on maximizing profits. We believe  that we must grow at least as fast as the markets we serve and that we must diversify our customers in order to establish a basis for stable growth in revenues and profits.  To that end,  we are investing  heavily  to address three large new markets which have relatively short windows of opportunity. First, we are beginning to see the fruits of our investments in the North  American PCS market, with the initial volume shipments of our new CDMA product.  Second, we are developing new CDMA products and working to extend their application into the Korean PCS market.  Finally, we have seen interest in our new multicarrier product by several  major cellular service providers.  We are also bringing our new 4" wafer fab on line which will enable us to support the state-of-the-art devices required by these new products.

<P>

	We strengthened our management team during the second quarter by adding John Barlow as Vice President of Materials and Bill Wishart as Vice President of Human Resources.   We have also expanded the responsibilities of some key players within the organization.  In recognition of their capabilities and outstanding contributions, we have promoted Joe Veni to the position of Sr. Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Tim Heyboer to Vice President, Engineering; Bill Zucker to Vice President of Product Line Management; and Dave Piazza to Vice President of  Semiconductor R&D.  

<P>

	After devoting twelve years of his career to making Spectrian a highly successful company, Dave Wisherd has resigned his position as a member and Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Technical Officer in order to pursue some personal and business interests.  We are not losing Dave, however, since he will continue in the role of a part-time employee and will remain a valuable advisor to me, to the board, and to the R&D organization.

<P>

	Your management team is looking forward to a promising future at Spectrian.  We are in a growing market; we are bringing out a leading product portfolio; we have excellent technology, and we have a highly experienced team ready to seize these opportunities. 

<P>

Sincerely,
 
<P>

 <B>Spiegel, Inc. Reports<BR>
      Third Quarter Results</B>

<P>

Spiegel, Inc. announced on October 23, 1996, that revenues for the third quarter of  1996 were $620.9 million, a decrease of 9 percent from 685.0 million for the third quarter of 1995.  For the first nine months, total revenues were $1.924 billion, compared with $2.065 billion for the same period in 1995.  
<P>

    For the third quarter of 1996, Spiegel reported a net loss of $15.6 million, or $0.14 per share, compared with a net loss of $22.6 million, or $0.21 per share, in the third quarter of 1995.  For the first nine months of the year, a net loss of $33.2 million, or $0.31 per share, was reported, compared with a  net loss of $46.9 million, or $0.43 per share, in 1995.
<P>

    The company also reported that comparable store sales for its Eddie Bauer subsidiary decreased 6 percent for the quarter, with total Eddie Bauer retail sales increasing 3 percent.  Eddie Bauer’s comparable store sales for the nine months ended September 28, 1996, were flat, while total retail sales increased 9 percent.  
<P>

    During the third quarter, Eddie Bauer narrowed its store-based footwear assortment, a lower margin business, to free up space for a new, higher-margin product line known as EB Tek.  EB Tek is a collection of performance outerwear and activewear that was launched in the stores on September 18.  While this planned repositioning adversely affected comparable store sales for the quarter by more than 3 percentage points, the company stated that the initial response to the new product line has been strong and that it is expected to make a more positive contribution to overall store performance. 
<P>
 
    Total catalog sales decreased 10 percent in the quarter due primarily to weak response rates in the Spiegel and Newport News catalog divisions. 
 
<P>
   "Although we continue to see strong results from Eddie Bauer, our overall performance during the quarter was negatively affected by disappointing sales from Spiegel Catalog and a slower-than-anticipated rate of improvement in our credit operations,"  said John J. Shea, vice chairman, president and CEO of Spiegel, Inc.  "We continue to feel the effects of the stressed consumer credit market, especially the rising number of personal bankruptcies.  In addition, both Spiegel Catalog and Newport News have been negatively affected by lower productivity from catalog mailings."
<P>

    Finance revenue for the quarter declined 46 percent to $26.8 million, primarily due to a lower average level of owned customer receivables.  The decrease in average receivables was a result of prior sales of customer receivables to support the company’s financing strategy.
<P>

    The gross profit margin on net sales increased to 31.0 percent from 30.4 percent in last year’s third quarter.  This increase occurred because of reduced promotional activity in the Eddie Bauer division, which resulted in a lower level of markdowns.  The margin improvement also reflects the company’s tightened inventory management program, which resulted in an 11 percent decline in average inventories for the quarter and included the benefits gained from the full implementation of the company’s new retail distribution facility.  
<P>

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were 36.3 percent of total revenues for the quarter, compared with 39.1 percent in the year-earlier period.  Total S,G&A expenses declined 16 percent in the quarter, driven by initiatives aimed at reducing operating expenses and gaining efficiencies.  
<P>

    Looking ahead, Shea said he expects Eddie Bauer to continue to drive Spiegel, Inc.’s growth for the near future.  In addition, he said the company is encouraged by a repositioning plan developed by Spiegel Catalog’s new management team.  "It calls for increasing the presence of fashion brands in the catalog, improving catalog presentation, refocusing customer-acquisition efforts and enhancing customer service and retention,"  Shea said.  "Parts of the plan are now being implemented, and we’re confident that over time, it will help turn things around for this business."

Third Quarter Report<BR>
October 28, 1996<BR>
Message from John B. Blystone<BR>
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer<P>
 <a name="officers"></a>
<img align=bottom src="SPWSIG1.GIF" alt="signature"><P>


<B>Fellow Shareholders:</B>
<P>

	We are pleased to report our third consecutive quarter of significant improvement in Economic Value Added (EVA) and earnings.  Since the first of the year your company has improved EVA by $24.3 million, and the market value of SPX shares has virtually doubled.  This strong improvement reflects the beneficial impact of the changes we are making in the business, and our implementation of EVA.

<P>

	Income from continuing operations for the third quarter rose 38 percent before the costs of reorganization initiatives, and this was achieved despite the anticipated five percent decline in revenues. The company's operating ratios have significantly strengthened as well, and that is reflected in the accompanying income statements.    

<P>

<B>Third Quarter Results</B>

<P>

	For the third quarter of 1996, revenues were $255.0 million, or five percent less than third quarter 1995 revenues of $268.8 million.  The anticipated decrease was due to lower sales of program tools to motor vehicle dealers. 

<P>

	Third quarter income from continuing operations was $3.8 million, or $0.27 per share.  This included restructuring charges of $2.0 million ($3.2 million pre-tax), or $0.14 per share, associated with the previously announced reorganization of several specialty service tool divisions.  Earnings from continuing operations, before these incremental costs, were $0.41 per share.  

<P>

	Net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $3.1 million, or $0.22 per share, and compares with net income of $.7 million, or $0.05 per share, for the third quarter of 1995.  The third quarter of 1996 includes a $0.05 per share extraordinary loss resulting from costs to repurchase $17 million of the company's 11 3/4 percent senior subordinated notes.  During the third quarter of 1995, $15 million of notes were repurchased resulting in a $0.04 extraordinary loss, and the company reported losses from discontinued operations of $0.23 per share relating to the divestiture of SPX Credit Corporation.  

<P>

<B>Nine Month Results</B>

<P>

	Revenues for the first nine months were $857.9 million, up 2 percent over first nine months 1995 revenues of $837.9 million.  The increase was due principally to stronger sales of dealer equipment in the specialty service tools segment.  

<P>

	Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of 1996 was $10.1 million, or $0.73 per share, which included restructuring charges of $9.9 million ($15.9 million pre-tax), or $0.71 per share, associated with the company's cost reduction initiatives.  These initiatives include pre-tax charges of $5.3 million for early retirement programs, $3.5 million to streamline certain international specialty service tools operations, and $7.1 million associated with the previously announced reorganization of several domestic specialty service tool divisions.

<P>

	The $10.1 million income from continuing operations compares to $8.0 million, or $0.61 per share for last year's first nine months.  If the nine months 1996 after-tax restructuring charges of $9.9 million are excluded, income would be improved to $20 million, or equivalent to $1.44 per share. 

<P>

	Net income for the first nine months of 1996 was $9.0 million, or $0.65 per share, and compares to $4.4 million, or $0.33 per share, in 1995.

<P>

<B>Economic Value Added</B>

<P>

	Earlier I mentioned that on a year-to-date basis we have improved EVA by $24.3 million.  We believe our implementation of EVA is a significant force behind the company's rapid turnaround in financial performance.  For example, we believe our cash  flow performance, which is driven by a combination of profitability, improved working capital management and significantly reduced capital spending, is a direct result of our EVA mindset. 


<P>
EVA motivates capital efficiency, and this is illustrated by reduced capital spending this year, without sacrificing the company's future.  This reduction has resulted from more disciplined investing by our business leaders, and we believe that disciplined investing is a direct result of their EVA training and drive for long-term EVA improvement.

<P>

	Our rapid implementation and improvement of EVA was  recently recognized by Stern Stewart & Co., the originators of the EVA financial discipline, in a series of advertisements the firm placed in Fortune Magazine.  Joel M. Stern, Managing Partner of Stern Stewart & Co., says "SPX epitomizes converting managers and employees into value change agents for the shareholder.  No firm has done it better."  We are proud of this recognition and the EVA improvement our SPX associates have achieved.  We intend to extend EVA incentive programs to another 5900 employees by January 1, 1997.   

<P>

<B>Our Focus on Growth</B>

<P>

	Improving EVA also requires that we set high growth targets.  In that regard, we are very focused on positioning ourselves to achieve annual double digit revenue growth, and on rapidly increasing our penetration in global markets.  To underscore that focus, we recently announced two senior leadership appointments in our specialty service tool segment.

<P>

	Ronald Ortiz has been appointed President of SPX International Tool and Equipment.  He is responsible for developing international growth opportunities for our specialty service tool and equipment segment.  He was succeeded as President of SPX Aftermarket Tool and Equipment by Mark A. Wrightsman, who joined the company from GE where he served in a number of international and domestic assignments.

<P>

	Much of SPX Corporation's sales now come from North American markets.  We intend to increase our focus on global markets, and we have chosen two widely respected international business leaders as key members of the team responsible for this growth.  

<P>

<B>Sealed Power and Hy-Lift Divisions</B>

<P>

	The planned sales of the Sealed Power and Hy-Lift divisions are progressing.  The due diligence process by the purchaser of Sealed Power Division is moving along as expected, and the documents required for regulatory review of the transaction have been filed.  The due diligence and regulatory review for the sale of Hy-Lift are complete and a closing of the transaction is planned for early November.

<P>

<B>Dividend Paid</B>

<P>

	During the third quarter of 1996 the company paid a regular dividend of $0.10 per share.  This is the 57th year in which the company has continuously paid dividends.

<P>

<B>Looking Ahead</B>

<P>

	We remain confident that the company will complete the year with a significantly improved fourth quarter and full year performance, absent a prolonged automotive industry strike.  The markets for our products remain solid, and much of the benefit from our cost reduction initiatives still lies ahead.  The company is getting better every day, and our rapid improvement in earnings and EVA clearly shows we are meeting our commitment to SPX shareholders to deliver a steady improvement in company performance.

<b>Standard Microsystems Corporation Announces a Return to Profitability in the Third Quarter of Fiscal 1996</b>
<p>
Hauppauge, New York - December 19, 1995 -- Standard Microsystems Corporation  (SMCR) (NASDAQ: SMSC) returned to profitability in the third quarter ended November 30, 1995.  Revenues for the third quarter were $90.6 million, 13.6% below the revenues of $104.8 million which were reported for the third quarter of the previous fiscal year, but up by 6.0% from the $85.4 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal 1996.  Net income was $0.3 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to $6.8 million, or $0.51 per share, in the third quarter of the last fiscal year, but up from the net loss of $12.1 million, or $0.91 per share, reported in the second quarter of fiscal 1996. 
<p>
For the first nine months ended November 30, 1995, revenues declined 10.3% to $248.2 million, from revenues of $276.8 million in the comparable period of fiscal 1995.  The net loss for the period was $14.8 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to net income of $17.8 million, or $1.34 per share, in the first nine months of the previous fiscal year.
<p>
During the third quarter, SMC signed a letter of intent for the sale of its Enterprise Networks Business Unit (ENBU) to Cabletron Systems.  Under the agreement, Cabletron Systems would acquire the business unit, including its products and technologies for $77.5 million in cash.
<p>
After the sale of the ENBU, the System Products Division will consist of the Desktop Networks Business Unit (DNBU) and the Workgroup Networks Business Unit (WNBU).  The DNBU will continue to develop and market advanced network interface cards.  The WNBU, recently formed in October, will concentrate on the development and marketing of workgroup hubs and new workgroup switches.  
<p>
Both business units will sell their products through the Company’s value-added resellers (VARs) and channel partners.  For several years, SMC has been widely recognized as a leading supplier of desktop and workgroup network products to these organizations.  In addition, SMC’s technical strength in the rapidly-growing Fast Ethernet market should help to promote the growth of this business.
<p>
SMC plans to use the proceeds from the ENBU transaction to take advantage of the strong demand for the semiconductor integrated circuit products of the Component Products Division and to expand the other two business units of the System Products Division.  The Component Products Division is manufacturing capacity-limited and the proceeds from this transaction will help SMC in its efforts to increase the levels of production from its semiconductor wafer foundry suppliers.  As a further result of this transaction, the System Products Division plans to increase its workgroup product development efforts and strengthen its sales and marketing channels.
<p>
The closing of the ENBU transaction, targeted for the current fourth quarter, is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and the receipt of regulatory approvals.
<p>
System products provided 59% of SMC’s revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 1996, compared to 69% in the comparable period of fiscal 1995.  The ENBU contributed 9% of system products revenues and the DNBU and WNBU combined contributed 91% of system products revenues.  Component products provided 41% of SMC’s revenues in the third quarter, compared to 31% in the third quarter of the previous year.  
<p>
Standard Microsystems Corporation, with headquarters in Hauppauge, NY, is a leading worldwide supplier of personal computer (PC) LAN system products and semiconductor very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits.  
<p>
SMC’s Component Products Division supplies VLSI circuits for PC and embedded control systems.  These include input/output (I/O) devices for disk drive control, communications interface and other PC motherboard functions, Ethernet and Fast Ethernet controllers for LAN applications and ARCNET controllers for embedded networking.
<p>
SMC’s System Products Division provides a broad range of networking solutions for scaling, managing and connecting LANs.  Its products include network interface cards, hubs and LAN switches for interconnecting LANs.  SMC has an installed base of over 10 million nodes.  SMC uses internally developed integrated circuits to achieve lower costs and to enhance product performance.

<CENTER><B>RECORD HIGH RESULTS POSTED FOR SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 1997 </B></CENTER>
<P>

	We are pleased to report the Company continued to achieved record high results for net income, earnings per share and revenues for its latest fiscal quarter.  During the second quarter of fiscal 1997, ended September 30, 1996, Stanford Telecom achieved net income and earnings per share of $1.9 million and $.29, respectively, increases of 36% and 32% from the comparative results posted during the second quarter of the previous fiscal year.  For the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company reported an all time high quarterly record for revenues of $ 41.1 million, compared with $35.6 million reported during the second quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

	For the first half of fiscal 1997, the Company achieved record high net income of $3.8 million and earnings per share of $.58,  increases of 50% and 45%, respectively, over the results posted during the first half of the previous fiscal year.   Record high revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1997 of $81.9 million compares with $71.5 million achieved during the first half of fiscal 1996.

<P>

<B>STRONG BOOKINGS CONTINUE</B><BR>

	The Company posted funded bookings of $38.2 million and $41.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively, and $79.3 million and $79.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996 and 1995, respectively.  At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 1997, backlog stood at $79.8 million.

<P>

<B>MAINTAINING OUR AGGRESSIVE BUSINESS STRATEGY</B><BR>
	Over a year ago we put forth a business strategy which called for growing revenues and expanding profit margins of our base business in order to provide steadily improving earnings and at the same time provide research and development funds for high growth strategic commercial products.  Over the past year Stanford Telecom has successfully expanded revenues and margins to record levels while also increasing its R&D investments for development of products in satellite telephony systems, wireless broadband communications (LMDS & MMDS), cable high speed modems and wireless telephony.  We believe these areas offer outstanding opportunities for Stanford Telecom.

<B>	STAR TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS <BR>
	Chairman Discusses Recent Activities That Are Expected to Have a <BR>
	Positive Impact on Shareholder Value, Revenue, and Future Growth</B><BR>

<P>

	 It was one year ago - <I>during the first quarter of fiscal 1996</I> - that our long-term OEM relationship with General Electric Medical Systems (GEMS) ended.  This relationship came to a premature halt when GEMS placed its final order.

<P>

	The ramifications of that single action have had a profound impact on our Company.  It challenged us to be acutely prudent in our financial dealings.  It required us to be focused in our marketing and new product development efforts, and challenged us to seek out new ways to grow our Company.

<P>

	While the financial results for the first quarter, which are listed below, continue to reflect these challenges, I want to share with you several significant activities that we believe will have a positive impact on shareholder value, earnings, revenue, and future growth.

<P>

<U><B>Star Receives GEMS Arbitration Payment</B></U>

<P>

	On August 19, 1996, we announced that GEMS paid Star $9.4 million to satisfy the arbitration award Star obtained in its breach of contract dispute.  We partially utilized GEMS' payment of the award to resolve some of our most pressing challenges and to chart a new, exciting course for our Company.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>	 	<B>We repurchased 80% of GE's preferred stock holdings.</B>  With the GE preferred stock repurchase, and two prior preferred stock repurchases completed in March and April 1995, the percentage of total capital stock owned by common shareholders rose from 48% a year ago to 92% today.

<P>

		The stock repurchase <B>also eliminated a half-million dollar quarterly preferred stock dividend</B> overhang which negatively affected reported earnings per share and had accumulated to $5 million.  As a result, we expect to see a significant improvement in earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 1997 as well as a positive impact on the third and fourth quarter earnings per share.

<P>

<blockquote>October 29, 1996<P>



To Our Shareholders:<P>

This was a momentous quarter for Statewide.  During the three months ended September 30, 1996, the Company declared its first quarterly dividend; initiated and completed a stock repurchase program for five percent of its outstanding stock; carried on its impressive loan growth, particularly to commercial borrowers; and continued to improve our distribution system, as demonstrated by core deposit growth.  In addition, on September 30, 1996, omnibus spending legislation was enacted which, among other effects, mitigated the disparity between insurance premiums for deposits insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) and deposits insured by the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF).  The impact to the Company was that, in exchange for lower future insurance premiums, there was a one-time fee assessed equal to $0.657 for each $100 of deposits held by the Company at March 31, 1995.  Accordingly, during the third quarter, the Company recognized $2.7 million additional FDIC insurance expense, which reduced third quarter income by of $1.7 million or $0.37 per share.  Even though this charge negatively impacts the third quarter results, I am pleased that the legislative process has resolved the insurance premium disparity which worked to the disadvantage of a healthy thrift industry.  This is the first step toward merging thrift and bank charters so that community banks, such as ours, can compete on equal ground.

<P>

As a result of the charge, there was a net loss of $492,000, or $0.11 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.  Exclusive of the SAIF assessment, the net income of the Company for that three month period was $1,205,000, or $0.26 per share, as compared to $500,000, for the same quarter last year and $1,154,000, or $0.24 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 1996.  Nine-month earnings to date totaled $1,867,000, or $0.39 per share Without the SAIF assessment, net income for that period was $3,564,000, or $0.74 per share, compared to $2,018,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1995.  The Company completed its initial public offering on September 29, 1995.  Accordingly, per share data did not exist for the prior periods.

<P>

Growth in loans and investment securities is reflected in the results for the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 1996 through increased net interest income, after provisions for loans losses, which grew $1.6 million and $3.7 million respectively, from the same periods a year ago.  These increases were partially offset by growth of $0.3 million and $1.5 million in other non-interest expense primarily incurred in support of our marketing and operational objectives, including staffing of the Company's three new branches opened during the period since March 31, 1995.

<P>

Also during this past quarter, the Company sold securities to fund loan growth and identified other securities to sell in order to reposition its investment portfolio, resulting in a loss of $1.1 million before taxes, or $701,000 after taxes.  Offsetting this impact to net income was the reversal of a $702,000 tax liability which expired during the quarter.

<P>

Finally, non-interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 1996 includes $40,000 and $565,000 from the collection of unaccrued interest, associated with loans whose principal had been repaid, as compared with $347,000 in the prior year's similar periods.  Further discussion of our quarterly results in  SEC Form 10Q will be available upon request after November 15,1996.

<P>

I am pleased that our earnings growth has continued to improve over preceding quarters and that our nine-month earnings of $0.74 per share before the SAIF assessment demonstrate strong, sustained results.  I continue to be excited about what we've achieved, and how well positioned we are to move forward, and I assure you that we will continue to work creatively and diligently to increase shareholder  value. Thank you for your confidence.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	THIRD QUARTER 1996

<P>

	Our third quarter results were favorable compared with 1995, and we are well ahead of 1995 on a year to date basis.  We earned $2.8 million ($0.31 per share) in the third quarter of 1996, before an extraordinary charge of $0.3 million ($0.04 per share) relating to a previously announced debt refinancing.  During the third quarter of 1995, the Company reported net income of $2.6 million ($0.29 per share).  Revenue in the third quarter of 1996 was $28.8 million, which was 10% higher than the $26.3 million reported in the third quarter of 1995.  
<P>

	Net income in the first nine months of 1996, excluding the previously noted extraordinary charge, was $3.9 million ($0.43 per share) compared with $2.8 million ($0.31 per share) in the same period of 1995.  Revenue for the  first  nine months  of 1996
totaled $66.5 million compared to $50.3 million in the first nine months of 1995, due in large part to the inclusion in 1996 of 9 months' revenue from the Pave-Mark thermoplastic marking materials and equipment business acquired in May 1995.  Excluding the effect of the acquired thermoplastic business, year to   date sales increased 9% in 1996 compared with the same nine month period last year.
	
<P>
Our optical film product line and international units continue to show disappointing revenue comparisons.  Third quarter sales of domestic highway delineation products were 13% higher than last year, but revenue from domestic optical film and international units were lower by 12% and 7% respectively.  
	
<P>
Gross margin for the third quarter of 1996 was 37% compared with 40% in 1995.  The decline was largely attributable to a sales mix which favored lower margin products, including thermoplastic, and competitive pricing for certain product lines. Selling, general, and administrative expenses declined to  14% of  sales in the third quarter of 1996 compared with 15% in 1995.  The improvement is largely attributable to economies of scale achieved from consolidating several functions from the acquired thermoplastic company.   

<P>
	As a result of the Company's successful $45 million debt refinancing during the quarter, we recorded a $0.3 million ($0.04 per share) extraordinary charge in the third quarter attributable to the write-off of deferred financing fees.  The new credit facility is unsecured, and the interest rate on borrowings is approximately one percentage point lower than the interest rate applicable to the refinanced debt. 

<P>
	We continue to purchase shares of stock in open market transactions under a previously announced stock buyback program.  In the third quarter, we purchased 38,500 shares and through September 29, 1996, we have purchased 148,500 shares at an average price of $8.18.  

<P>
	We are currently developing our 1997 business plan.  Our highest priority is profit improvement.  An improved and expanded optical film product  line combined with a more favorable spending climate in Europe give us reasons to be optimistic.

<P>
	On a personal note, I am pleased to announce that the Company has begun a search for my successor.  It is anticipated that a candidate will be identified and brought on board within the next few months.  At that time, I will retire, retaining my position as a member of the Board of Directors.  In     addition,  I will enter into a two year consulting agreement with the Company with duties to bring about an orderly transfer of the C.E.O. position and to    represent the Company in matters affecting highway legislation at the federal and state levels. 

<P>

Sincerely,

 ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 1996 RESULTS</B></CENTER>

<P>

	Sales for the three month period ending October 31, 1996 totaled $336,834,000 compared to $323,779,000 a year ago.  Net earnings for the three months totaled $7,189,000 or $.22 per share compared to net earnings of $15,000,000 or $.45 per share for the same period one year ago.
<P>

	Sales for the first nine months totaled $797,100,000 compared to $932,641,000 for the same period a year ago.  Net earnings for the nine months, which included a special $20 million litigation charge, totaled $6,215,000 or $.19 compared to $47,942,000 or $1.45 per share a year ago.  Net earnings, excluding the litigation charge, would have been $.58 for the nine months.
	
<P>
Distribution sales totaled $123 million for the quarter compared to $110 million a year ago, representing a 12 percent increase.  Year-to-date Distribution sales have increased approximately 18 percent.  Equipment sales, which carry a lower profit margin than parts and service sales, have accounted for the majority of Distribution’s increased volume.  As a result, this segment’s comparative operating profit margins are down for the quarter and nine month periods.  Distribution sales produced 6.3 percent and 5.9 percent operating profit for the quarter and first nine months respectively compared to 7.2 percent for the entire year of 1995.  Distribution’s backlog of unfilled orders remains high, totaling $78 million compared to $42 million one year ago.
	
<P>
Tactical Vehicle Systems (TVS) sales for the quarter totaled approximately $79 million compared to $72 million for the same period last year.  Operating profits for TVS were 4.4 percent for the first nine months of the year.  Truck  assembly resumed during this period following three quarters of retrofitting vehicles built during the program test phase.  TVS produced 728 vehicles during the most recent quarter and anticipates assembling an additional 1000 units prior to year-end.  
	
<P>
During the quarter, the Company announced the conclusion of negotiations to extend the Family of Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) contract through 1998 and the receipt of approximately $37 million in contracts to produce FMTV vehicles for other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and Foreign militaries.
	
<P>
Engineered Power Systems (EPS) quarterly sales totaled approximately $135 million compared to $142 million for the same period last year.  Operating profits for this segment were 7.9 percent for the first nine months of this year.  While most product lines within EPS experienced sales gains, gas turbine equipment sales had a negative comparison.  Turbine equipment sales totaled $64 million during the quarter compared to $78 million for the third quarter a year ago.  Third quarter sales compare favorably, however, to the first two quarters of the current year, each of which produced $35 million in turbine equipment sales.  Gas turbine orders for the third quarter totaled $121 million, representing the second consecutive quarter of healthy turbine orders.  Net orders for the past two quarters were approximately $220 million compared to $51 million for the same period a year ago.  
	
<P>
Turbine support product sales, which include parts and service and operation and maintenance, were up nicely.  Sales totaled approximately $43 million as compared to $36 million during the third quarter of 1995.  EPS diesel sales were also higher, totaling $26 million for the quarter compared to $22 million a year ago.
	
<P>
This press release contains forward-looking information.  The forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements relating to the Company’s performance and industry conditions for the year, are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

<BLOCKQUOTE>STOKELY USA, INC. OCONOMOWOC, WI, October 30, 1996 - Stokely USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: STKY) reported a net loss of $1,812,000 ($.16 per share) excluding a nonrecurring charge for the second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 1996, compared to a net loss of $3,640,000 ($.32 per share) in the year-ago second quarter and a net loss of $4,264,000 ($.38) for the previous quarter ended June 30, 1996.  The net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 including a previously announced nonrecurring charge of $13,100,000 ($1.15 per share) relating to the Company's decision to restructure its core canned vegetable business was $14,912,000 ($1.31 per share).

<P>

	Net sales for the second quarter were $51,630,000 compared to $51,294,000 last year.  Total sales increased modestly for the second quarter despite a decrease of $4,297,000 or 9.5% in canned vegetable sales. The decline in canned sales was due primarily to a $8,295,000 decrease in sales volume offset, in part, by a $3,998,000 increase in average selling prices.  The decrease in canned sales volume was attributable to lower available inventory caused by weather related delays in this summer's production. The Company's actions to increase prices in certain markets while exiting others to improve operating margins also contributed to the sales volume decline.  Frozen sales increased $4,633,000 during the quarter, more than offsetting the decline in canned sales. The frozen sales increase reflected liquidation of frozen inventory as the Company proceeded with its previously announced exit from the frozen vegetable business. Liquidation of the balance of remaining frozen inventory is expected to be completed in the quarter ending December 31, 1996.

<P>

	This year's second quarter net loss of $1,812,000, excluding the nonrecurring charge, was an improvement of $1,828,000 over the year-ago quarter loss of $3,640,000 due primarily to  improved market pricing in the canned business. The magnitude of the canned performance improvement compared to last year was diminished by the high proportion of higher cost inventory from last year's production season sold during the second quarter just ended. The 
higher cost of that inventory reflects a higher per unit fixed manufacturing component primarily due to weather related  production volume shortfalls in the summer of 1995.
	
<P>

	The nonrecurring charge of $13.1 million, the majority of which is non-cash, will cover costs associated with the sale of closed plants, corporate headquarters, and related severance and other restructure costs.  As a result of the nonrecurring charge, the Company is in violation  of certain financial and other covenants in most of its Industrial Development Revenue Bonds and is currently working to amend these covenants.

<P>

	Commenting on the quarter, Stokely President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen W. Theobald said: "The operating loss for the second quarter, excluding the nonrecurring charge, is half the year-ago loss and the improvement would have been greater but a high proportion of the inventory sold during the quarter was from last year's higher cost production. Nevertheless, a loss is a loss, and not acceptable in our view. That is the  reason we are undertaking the recently announced restructuring of our core canned vegetable business. We need to change the underlying economics of our business to the point where we can be consistently profitable. Therefore, we are undertaking initiatives that will affect every line of the income statement. We're changing our approach to market segments and distribution channels to improve the quality of our revenue stream.  We've identified major changes in our manufacturing configuration that reduce cost and at the same time, further improve product quality.  And, we've simplified general corporate support to improve efficiency and reduce general and administrative expense. These initiatives affect virtually every part of our business.  When we have completed their implementation, we believe we will have a solid foundation on which to build for the future."

<P>

	"While we won't see the major benefits of our restructuring initiatives this fiscal year because this summer's production was completed prior to undertaking the restructure, our cost and expense structure for the second half of the fiscal year will be more favorable than last year's second half. Further, selling prices have recently improved in response to what we believe are more normal  industry inventory levels.   If current selling prices hold, the combination of more favorable costs and higher selling prices, will result in continuation of the improving trend in our operating results as the year continues."</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To Our Stockholders:

<P>

Stone Container Corporation reported a net loss for the third quarter and first nine months of 1996.  Revenues were down from the corresponding periods of 1995.   
<P>

	The reduced results continued to reflect weak prices for most of our company’s core products.  The loss for this year’s third quarter included a non-recurring charge of approximately $11 million, or $.11 per common share, related to the sale of assets, and an extraordinary charge of 
$3 million, or $.03 per common share, pertaining to the early extinguishment of debt.
	
<P>
During the third quarter, we completed the sale of the majority of our wood products assets to a new company, U.S. Forest Industries, Inc.  That sale led to the one-time charge of $11 million.  Also in the third quarter, we merged our retail bag operations with those of Gaylord Container Corporation to form S&G Packaging, L.L.C., the largest retail bag company in the world, with annual sales in excess of $300 million.
	
<P>
In September, we redeemed our 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due in 1999.  The redemption together with open market purchases of the notes in the second and third quarters totaled $230 million.
	
<P>
Pulp and paper pricing is recovering, and demand for many of our core products strengthened during the third quarter.  Containerboard activity was particularly good during the quarter.  Shipments are climbing, exports are strong, and inventories are at manageable levels.  Market pulp inventories have also dropped sharply since the beginning of the year, and demand is on the rise.  In light of these improving industry conditions, we announced price increases for both containerboard and market pulp effective October 1.
	
<P>
The newsprint business is still challenging, but inventories are down, and we believe the bottom of the cycle has been reached and that recovery will begin soon.	
	
<P>
Looking ahead, we are confident that demand will continue to rise across our product lines, and that price restorations will occur as conditions continue to improve.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Fellow Shareholders:

<P>

I am pleased to report the results of the third quarter of 1996. Funds from operations were $14,430,000, or $0.68 per share, up 13% from last year's $0.60 per share result.  For the 132 facilities owned since June 30, 1995, revenues and net operating income grew 7.1% and 6.1%, respectively, over last year.  Although very respectable, this "same store" performance is a little less than we would have liked, largely because of increased property and other local taxes.  In general, however, we are very encouraged by the market conditions for self-storage across the country.

<P>

On the last day of the quarter, Storage USA closed the final funding of the $220 million investment in our company by Security Capital U.S. Realty under the strategic alliance formed in March.  On that same day, Storage USA completed the
acquisition of three self-storage facilities, bringing the total acquired in the first three quarters of 1996 to 54.  With purchases already completed and anticipated during the fourth quarter, we will meet our highest expectations for our 1996 acquisition program.

<P>

The success of the acquisition program allowed us to deploy efficiently all of the capital invested by Security Capital U.S. Realty.  It also positioned us well for the next significant financing event for Storage USA, the debut public offering of investment grade unsecured notes.  I am very pleased with the results of that offering, which was completed on November 4, 1996.  Demand for the $100 million offering of 7-year notes was very high among an exceptional list of potential purchasers, and we were able to price the notes at a spread of 95 basis points over comparable Treasury securities.  This was an outstanding execution and a very important first step forward in our plan to incorporate longer term debt into our balance sheet.

<P>

On October 15, 1996, we paid our third quarter dividend of $0.5625 per share of common stock to shareholders of record on September 27, 1996.  Finally, I encourage all of you to visit our home page on the world wide web (http:/www.sus.com). I recently wrote my inaugural monthly letter on the web site which described some of the supply and demand conditions that we see in self-storage, and I look forward to additional communications with you.

<BLOCKQUOTE> <CENTER><B>STORMEDIA ANNOUNCES RESULTS FOR THIRD QUARTER 1996 </B></CENTER>

<P>

SANTA CLARA, CA,--(PR NEWSWIRE)--October 15, 1996--StorMedia Incorporated (NASDAQ/NMS: STMD) today reported net sales, net loss and net loss per share of $41.6 million, $9.1 million and $0.52 , respectively, for the quarter ended September 27, 1996.

<P>

Net sales, net earnings and earnings per share for the quarter ended September 29, 1995 were $46.0 million, $7.1 million and $0.40, respectively. Sequentially, net sales were down 28% from $57.7 million for the second quarter and the Company incurred a loss for the quarter compared to earnings per share of $0.42 for the second quarter. This was principally due to substantially lower sales to Maxtor Corporation caused by Maxtor’s failure to purchase the volumes under the volume purchase contract among the Company, Hyundai, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Maxtor. In an effort to replace the volume under contract with Maxtor, the Company accelerated qualification and production of new products, which has resulted in significantly lower yields and gross margins.   

<P>

In addition, the results for the quarter ended September 27, 1996 included a one-time charge of $2.2 million, principally related to the write-off of loans due from a supplier of plated and polished substrates to the Company.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 27, 1996, net sales, net earnings, and earnings per share were $160.4 million, $8.1 million, and $0.45, respectively. This compares to $108.5 million, $12.8 million and $0.89, respectively, for the nine months ended September 29, 1995.

<P>

The statements in this press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from predicted results. Such risks include among others: dependence on a limited number of customers; reduction in orders from existing customers; limited number of  potential customers; variability in gross margins and operating results; risk of excess industry capacity; intensely competitive industry; rapid technological change; rapid changes in customer and product mix; and dependence on suppliers. Further risks are described in the Company’s Form 10-K, Form 8-K, and Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 29, 1996, July 23, 1996, and August 13, 1996, respectively, and other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

<B><CENTER>THIRD QUARTER 1996 RESULTS</CENTER></B>
<P>
Dear Fellow Stockholders:
<P>
	For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, Stratasys' revenues increased 92% to $4,402,436 from $2,292,369 reported for the third quarter of 1995.  The net profit for the period was $63,847 or $.01 per share outstanding, compared to net income of $48,998 or $.01 per share outstanding for the comparable period in 1995.  Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales rose to 66% in the third quarter of 1996 from 65.7% in the third quarter of 1995.
<P>
	For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, revenue increased to $12,471,780 as compared with $6,111,468 for the comparable 1995 period, an increase of 104%.  Net income increased to $646, 921 for the nine months ended September 30, 1996, compared with a net loss of $123,887 for the 1995 period.
<P>
	The third quarter of 1996 showed continued strong demand for our flagship product, the FDM 1650.  In addition, we began to ship a greater volume of our desktop 3D push-button printer, Genisys.  Overall, our total number of unit orders all placed in the third quarter of 1996 was 150% higher than the comparable quarter in 1995.  Production increased to meet sustained demand and we added approximately 20,000 square feet of manufacturing space, which reflects our continued optimism in the rapid prototyping market.
<P>
	The fourth quarter of our fiscal year has been historically our strongest quarter.  In 1995, approximately 40% of the company's revenue was earned in the fourth quarter and we expect that will also be the case this year.
<P>
	We are clearly seeing an emerging market for the concept/visualization product, Genisys.  Our distributors are installing machines current with end-users.
<P>
	We remain optimistic for the remainder of this year and into the first half of next year.
<P>
	Stratasys, Inc., founded in 1989, is a manufacturer of rapid prototyping systems for automotive, aerospace, industrial, electronic, medical, and consumer products OEM's.  The Company's patented Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Genisys rapid prototyping processes create 3-dimensional plastic and wax prototype parts directly from 3-D CAD systems.  See our Home Page <A HREF="www.stratasys.com">www.stratasys.com</A> on the Internet.

Sincerely,
<P>

<P>


To our Shareholders,

<P>

<U><B>Third Quarter Performance</B></U>

<P>

Net sales for the quarter increased 14% to $59,914,000 compared to sales of $52,703,000 for the third quarter of 1995.  Sales for the nine months totaled $172,871,000 compared to sales totaling $156,224,000 during the same period in 1995, an increase of 11%.

<P>

Net income was $2,223,000, or $.24 per share, in the third quarter, an increase of 29% as compared to net income of $1,722,000, or $.19 per share, during the same period in 1995.  Net income for the first nine months was $5,452,000, or $.58 per share, an increase of 12% as compared to net income of $4,882,000, or $.52 per share, during the same period in 1995.

<P>

The Company also, on September 23, declared a cash dividend of $.05 per share, payable October 21 to shareholders of record on October 10.

<U><B>Third Quarter Highlights</B></U>

<P>

Our Track To the Future marketing program was successfully launched during the third quarter.  The primary objective is market share penetration through the targeting of new accounts by the entire sales staff.

<P>

The acquisition of Mountain West Dental Company, Inc. operating in Idaho, Utah, and  Nevada was completed on September 12.  Mountain West was previously a Sullivan independent representative producing approximately $3 million of annual sales.  This transaction is expected to result in an additional $11 to $12 million of annual sales as well as preserving the previous sales. As a result, Sullivan opened new equipment sales and service centers in Boise, Idaho, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

<P>

On August 19, we announced an agreement in principal to purchase all the assets and assume substantially all the liabilities of Capitol Dental Supply, Inc.  Capitol is based near Baltimore and operates in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.  As a result of this transaction, Sullivan acquires Capitol's  supply, equipment, and service business estimated to produce between $9 and $10 million in annual sales.  It assures the continuity of their sales organization of 12 sales representatives, 9 service techs, as well as other support personnel.

<P>

September 1 marked the opening of an additional equipment sales and service center in the Kansas City, Kansas area, allowing us entry into another new market area.

<P>

<U><B>Future Outlook</B></U>

<P>

<CENTER><U><B>SYMMETRICOM REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B></U></CENTER>

<P>

<I>San Jose, California, October 9, 1996</I> --- SymmetriCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:SYMM) reported net earnings of $2,258,000, or fourteen cents per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 which ended September 30, 1996, compared to $2,771,000, or seventeen cents per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 were a record $32.0 million compared to $27.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1996. 

<P>

"We are pleased to report record bookings and sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 for both our telecommunications equipment and semiconductor operations," commented Dan Rasdal, Chairman and CEO of SymmetriCom, Inc. "Additionally, we increased our investment in research and development, marketing and sales support during the quarter as we pursued opportunities which we believe exist in our markets.  However, while we are encouraged by our first quarter sales, our challenge over the long-term is to increase earnings. We must grow sales and improve gross margins." 

<P>

First quarter sales for Telecom Solutions, SymmetriCom's telecommunications equipment operation, were $20.0 million, compared to $17.2 million for the first quarter of last year. "The results for Telecom Solutions reflect strong domestic sales of core synchronization products," commented Dan Rasdal. "We continue to invest in enhancing our synchronization technology and developing new products, including wireless synchronization products and network management software."

<P>

During September 1996, Telecom Solutions entered into a contract to provide approximately $12.0 million of synchronization systems to a large interexchange carrier for its domestic telecommunications network through December 1998. Approximately $2.8 million of the $12.0 million was shipped in the first quarter of fiscal 1997. 

<P>

Linfinity Microelectronics Inc., SymmetriCom's semiconductor operation, reported net sales for the quarter of $12.0 million, compared to $10.5 million for the same quarter last year. "We are pleased with Linfinity's sales this quarter, up 15% over last year's first quarter and up 35% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996," said Dan Rasdal. "Linfinity booked record orders during the first quarter, largely as a result of new products introduced during the past three years. While sales have improved over the last two quarters, Linfinity must increase its focus on improving its gross margin."

<P>

This Quarterly Report to Shareholders contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of those Sections. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including the timing, cancellation or delay of customer orders, changes in the product or customer mix of sales, delays in new product development, introduction and production startup costs, increased competition, customer acceptance of new products, customer delays in qualification of key new products, and the overall condition of the semiconductor industry.

<P>

SymmetriCom, Inc. conducts business through two separate operating units. Telecom Solutions is a leading worldwide supplier of advanced network synchronization systems for telephone companies, private network operators and wireless service providers. Telecom Solutions also makes intelligent access systems for these same customers. Linfinity Microelectronics Inc. makes linear and mixed signal integrated circuits as well as modules used in power supply, data communications and signal conditioning applications for commercial, industrial, and defense and space markets.

(NYSE:SKT) today reported funds from operations (FFO) before minority interest for the second quarter ended June 30, 1996 rose 9% to $7.7 million, or $.73 per share on a fully-diluted basis, compared to $7.1 million, or $.67 per share in the same period of 1995. For the six months ended June 30, 1996, FFO increased by 9% to $15.5 million, or $1.47 per share on a fully-diluted basis, compared to $14.2 million, or $1.34 per share, in the same period of 1995.

<P>

Tanger posted the following increases during the quarter ended June 30, 1996, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 1995:   base rental income increased 9% to $12.4 million from $11.4 million; total revenues increased 6% to $18.2 million from $17.2 million; and net operating income increased 14% to $11.4 million from $10.0 million.

<P>

During the first six months of 1996, four expansions totaling 110,952 square feet were substantially completed at Tanger centers in Gonzales, LA (29,890 square feet), Williamsburg, IA (26,187 square feet), Branson, MO (25,000 square feet) and San Marcos, TX (29,875 square feet).

Base rental income increased 9% and net operating income increased 14% due to the growth in total square footage and additional efficiencies in the marketing and operations of our portfolio. From our oldest centers in North Conway, New Hampshire to our newest, most exciting addition currently under construction in Riverhead, New York, our company is committed to operating the most efficient and profitable properties possible."

<BLOCKQUOTE>To Our Shareholders:
<P>

We are pleased to report that orders and backlog have remained strong at our operating units and that we expect the second half of 1996 to show continued progress. 
<P>
While operating performance for the second quarter was consistent with the first quarter, we took charges in the second quarter of $4.3 million in connection with our litigation with TRW Inc., $1.6 million representing the premium and deferred costs associated with the repurchase of $17.3 million aggregate principal amount of our senior debentures, and an additional $1.1 million on research and development beyond the $500,000 incurred in last year's comparable quarter for our automotive airbag activities. The impact of these items resulted in a loss for the quarter of $3.5 million, or 27 cents per share on revenue for the quarter of $94 million. 
<P>
Earlier this month TRW Inc. made a payment to us in the amount of $139.8 million. Additionally, we have agreed with TRW to engage in further calculations to determine what additional payments are left to be made by TRW to satisfy the judgment and order of the United States District Court of Arizona. This payment confirms that the actions we've taken have clearly justified the costs and efforts made on behalf of our shareholders.
<P>
 In June, we repurchased $17.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 12.25% Senior Discount Debentures. The purchase price was $14.4 million and consisted of $757.03 per $1,000 principal amount of the debenture plus a premium of $72.80 per $1,000 principal amount. 
<P>
In addition to our ongoing efforts in the development of a new generation of automotive driver-side airbag inflator and a unique inflatable active seat belt, we recently acquired the rights to an airbag initiator which incorporates the use of a ceramic structure which provides a true hermetic seal and can be produced at a price that we believe will be competitive in the initiator marketplace. 
<P>
These automotive safety product development efforts plus our ongoing commitment to build future value at all our operating subsidiaries will, we believe, yield significant benefit for you, our shareholders.
Your continued support is appreciated.
<P>

<CENTER>TARO PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</CENTER>


<P>

Record Sales Continue for Third Consecutive Quarter of 1996 <BR>
Aggressive R&D Program Results in Five ANDA Approvals in 1996

<P>

Hawthorne, New York, October 24, 1996</B> - Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Nasdaq/NMS: TAROF) today reported record sales for the third quarter and the nine months ended  September 30, 1996, as well as a  sharp  increase in net income in the  third  quarter 
of 1996 compared to the third quarter of 1995.  The increase in net income occurred along with a significant rise in R&D expenditures in support of the Company’s increasingly successful R&D program.

<P>

<B>Record Sales and Aggressive R&D</B><BR>
Third quarter 1996 net sales increased 15 percent to a record $14,688,000 compared with $12,827,000 for the third quarter of 1995.  R&D expenditures increased 30 percent to $2,059,000, or 14 percent of sales, for the third quarter of 1996 from $1,581,000, or 12 percent of sales, for the third quarter of 1995.  Net income increased to $706,000 or $0.07 per share from $32,000, or $0.00 per share for the third quarter of 1995.  Net income for the third quarter of 1995 was adversely affected by a one-time charge of $1,100,000 associated primarily with uncollected receivables incurred by the Company.

<P>

For the nine-months ended September 30, 1996, net sales were a record $41,464,000 compared with $37,109,000, a 12 percent increase compared with the same period in 1995.  R&D expenditures increased 37 percent to $6,395,000, from $4,673,000 for the period.  Net income for the period decreased from $1,901,000, or $0.18 per share to $1,482,000, or $0.14 per share.  The decrease in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 is attributable to the increase in R&D expenditures, a facilities expansion program, and expenses incurred in United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") inspections.  The successful pre-approval inspections by the FDA were conducted at the Company’s facilities in both Israel and Canada during the first quarter of 1996.

<P>

<B>Multiple ANDA’s Approved in 1996</B><BR>
"Our extensive investment in R&D during recent years has produced impressive results in 1996," stated Barrie Levitt, M.D., Chairman of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries.  "Taro’s most recent achievement is the FDA approval of our Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") for carbamazepine tablets.  Production of carbamazepine utilizing active raw material synthesized by the Company should give us a successful entry into the U.S. solid dosage form market."

<P>

Vertically integrated production of carbamazepine is expected to enhance Taro’s competitive position in the marketplace for this product and make a solid contribution to future earnings.  The Company has twenty years of experience in manufacturing carbamazepine, during which time Taro has marketed the product in Israel and internationally under its own trade name, Teril®.

<P>

In addition, the June and July ANDA approvals of Clobetasol Propionate Cream, Clobetasol Propionate Ointment and Desoximetasone Ointment expanded Taro’s already extensive line of topical corticosteroids marketed in the U.S.

<P>

<B>Future Outlook</B><BR>
"With five ANDA approvals thus far in 1996, and more approvals expected, Taro has positioned itself for significant growth through the end of 1996 and in the coming years," Levitt stated.  The Company has multiple regulatory filings in Canada and Israel, and eight ANDA’s currently submitted to the FDA.  Six ANDA’s are for dermatologic products and two ANDA’s are for solid dosage form central nervous system products.

<P>

Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, a manufacturer and marketer of prescription and over-the-counter generic drug products, is well-positioned to take advantage of worldwide generic drug growth and the Company’s development of several novel pharmaceutical compounds.  Taro’s extensive research and development expertise, broad distribution network and vertical integration capabilities fuel the Company’s expansion in domestic and international markets.

<blockquote>Dear Shareholder:

<P>

	 We are pleased to report third quarter 1996 results.  Revenues for the quarter ended July 31, 1996 were $69.4 million, up 40 percent, and operating income before depreciation was $31.6 million, up 31 percent  over the same quarter in 1995.  Net income was $8.6 million, or $.35 per share, a 14 percent increase compared to 1995.  The results above represent the consolidated TCA Cable Partners, 75% owned by TCA, which was closed May 1, 1996.  The net minority interest before taxes is $1.6 million for the three months ended July 31, 1996.

<P>

	During the third quarter, several new systems were put under contract which will close in the fourth quarter.  The first was 8,000 subscribers in Van Buren, Arkansas, which will be acquired by TCA Cable Partners.  Van Buren is a system that is contiguous to Fort Smith, Arkansas, which will be obtained by TCA Cable Partners in exchange for the assets of TCA's Vallejo, California system.  There are approximately 30,000 subscribers in Fort Smith.  After obtaining these two systems, it is TCA's plan to connect the two with fiber optics, rebuild them to 750 MHz and have a state-of-the-art, full service communications network in this thriving area of Northwest Arkansas.  These two contracts will close in September and October, 1996, respectively.

<P>

	Advertising revenues during the third quarter increased to $10.6 million, representing 15% of gross revenues.  This segment of our company continues to offer exciting growth opportunities.  Presently, VPI, Inc., d.b.a. CableTime, TCA's wholly-owned subsidiary, has contracts with 73 cable operators with over 2.3 million subscribers in over 400 locations to sell advertising time on cable channels.  CableTime has become the largest third party cable advertising insertion company in the nation.  In addition, CableTime sells advertising time for five television stations, and represents several Spanish-language stations in Mexico to U.S. advertisers.  We expect CableTime to continue to increase as a percentage of revenues.  CableTime typically has lower operating margins than TCA's cable division, but has less capital requirements.

<P>

Sincerely,
</blockquote><p>

<CENTER><B>RESULTS OF THE THIRD QUARTER 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

<P>

	Teknowledge reported income of $188,561 and revenue of $1,847,212 for the third quarter of the year. Both numbers were up substantially over the previous year as you can see in the comparative tables below. Revenue for the third quarter was up 11% over the second quarter, rising to the highest level since the Company’s turnaround in 1993. The Company is actively pursuing new opportunities with the Federal government and recently submitted several new proposals for review.  

<P>

	Teknowledge will release its new Internet software product during the fourth quarter of 1996. Teknowledge’s offering will be based on several years of Associate System development projects. The Company has already demonstrated the product to a select group of potential customers. As we have stated previously, demand and competition for new Internet software products are predicted to be intense.  
	
<P>

	On August 27, 1996, Teknowledge and Trilogy Development Group, Inc. agreed to a settlement of their disputes. On August 29, 1996, Trilogy's attorneys provided written notification to the Federal District Court that the companies had reached a settlement. Under the agreement, Trilogy would provide consideration to Teknowledge and Teknowledge would grant a license to Trilogy to use the technology covered by the patent-in-suit. The agreement also provided that all lawsuits between the parties would be dismissed and that all previously existing debt between the parties would be canceled. The other details of the agreement are to be kept confidential by both parties.

<P>

	Nevertheless, on August 30, 1996, before formal documentation memorializing the settlement agreement was finalized, but after Trilogy's lawyers confirmed to the Court in writing that the case had been settled, the U.S. District Court entered an order granting Trilogy's motion for summary judgment invalidating the patent. In view of the Court's order, Trilogy has taken the position that no settlement yet exists and that it need not abide by the terms to which the parties agreed and represented to the Court. The Company has informed Trilogy that the Company intends to enforce the settlement agreement, and believes that Trilogy has breached the settlement agreement. Accordingly, on September 20, 1996, the Company filed a motion to vacate the judgment in light of the prior settlement. The Company and Trilogy engaged in discussions regarding the settlement agreement in light of the Court's judgment. There is no assurance that the parties will be able to resolve the issues without further litigation, that the Company’s motion to vacate and dismiss will be successful, or that the Company will be able to enforce the settlement agreement. 

<P>

	We cannot explain why the Court chose to rule on issues in our case with Trilogy after both parties had informed the Court of a settlement, removing the matter from the Court’s jurisdiction. Moreover, we do not believe that Trilogy should be able to renege on our mutually agreed settlement. We are hopeful the Court will agree now that it has all the facts.
 
<P>

	We are anticipating that 1996 will prove to be another record-setting year for the Company and look forward to continued growth and opportunity in 1997. We wish you a happy holiday season and a very good new year.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
NORWOOD, MA - Financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1997 (ended 11/24/96) remained strong.  Sales for the quarter increased 55% to a new record of $31,835,000, compared with $20,533,000 last year.  Net income increased to $2,274,000 or $.21 per share, compared with a loss of ($2,620,000) or ($.26) per share a year ago.  Net income included a one-time investment gain of $1,070,000 or $.10 per share.  The Company’s financial position remained strong with cash and short-term investments at quarter end amounting to $17,057,000.
<P>
	The record sales level and higher-than-planned operating profit for the quarter reflected solid gains in both the access and broadband business units.  Sales of data compression products also remained strong.  New orders for the quarter were up from the year-ago level but were below the recent record fourth quarter level which included the early receipt of some customer stocking orders.
<P>  
	Research and development for the quarter amounted to 12% of sales, continuing a strong investment program in major business areas.  The consolidation and move of manufacturing operations from the Fremont, California, site to the Norwood, Massachusetts, facility was completed as scheduled at the end of November.  Technology centers of excellence will continue to be located both in Fremont and Norwood.
<P>
	Telco Systems’ position in the integrated access market remains strong as business users accelerate expansion of voice and data networks.  Shipments of the Access60&reg; integrated access server continued to increase from the year-ago level, with several enhancements planned for introduction in the second fiscal quarter.
<P> 
	An important technology trial began during the quarter for our Intelligent Call Routing (ICR) technology for the Internet.  The new technology is designed to intercept modem calls before they hit the voice switching network and route the calls to a fast-packet data network, thus alleviating congestion of voice switches. Telco Systems will preview the ICR technology at the ComNet Trade Show (Booth #1346) in Washington D.C. from February 4-6.
<P> 
	We see good opportunities for our HyperSPAN and FOX family of products due to the continued demand for cost-effective deployment of T1 services in the local loop.
<P>
	Looking ahead, the Company remains strongly positioned to benefit from the access market growth expected to occur as a result of the recent deregulated environment in the telecom industry.

<P>
<B>THIRD QUARTER 1996</B><BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=-1>Reported October  23, 1996</FONT></I>
<P>
To Our Shareholders,
<P>
For the quarter ended September 30, 1996, Tencor reported revenues of $97 million, compared with $88 million in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $9.6 million or 30 cents per share. These results included a one time restructuring charge of $8.5 million, relating to the reduction in workforce we announced in September, and accrued expenses associated with our plans to consolidate the majority of our corporate facilities into a single site in Milpitas, California early next year. Net income, excluding the restruc- turing charge, was $14.9 million or 47 cents per share, compared with $18.2 million or 57 cents per share in the third quarter of 1995.  	
<P>
Revenues for the nine months of 1996 were $312.7 million compared with $234.3 million for the same period a year ago. Net income, including the restructuring charge, was $48.4 million or $1.53 per share, up from $46.5 million or $1.50 per share in the same period a year ago.	
<P>
The slowdown in the semiconductor industry continued to be evidenced during the quarter and was seen throughout our business worldwide. However, orders for the Surfscan AIT and the recently introduced Surfscan SP1 wafer inspection systems rose slightly from the previous quarter, as did orders for our metrology products from non- semiconductor customers. Third quarter book-to-bill was 0.68-to-1.  During the quarter, $65.5 million in orders were booked and $14.4 million in orders were canceled or rescheduled for delivery outside our one year backlog criteria.  We ended the quarter with a backlog of just under $150 million.	
<P>
In September, we implemented cost containment actions to realign our business in response to current market conditions. These actions included discretionary spending cuts company-wide, as well as the nearly 15 percent reduction in workforce, which primarily affected the areas of manufacturing and administration. At the same time, we maintained our focus on our technology and product portfolio. We ramped shipments of the Surfscan AIT during the quarter with nine units shipped in the month of September alone. Multiple units are now installed at several of our customers. These AIT systems were used initially for contamination monitoring and are now being transferred into production use. We also recently launched the new Tencor HRP-200 High Resolution Profiler which extends our metrology capabilities for complex processes, such as chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) — an area of growing importance in semiconductor processing today.

<BLOCKQUOTE>  <B>Second Quarter Fiscal Year<BR>
1997 Report to Shareholders</B>
<P>
 

In the second quarter of fiscal 1997, Tescorp continued to expand its presence in the Argentine cable television industry.  In September, Tescorp entered into a contract to purchase a 96.0 percent joint venture interest in the assets of  Comodoro Rivadavia T.V., a company that provides cable television service to approximately 5,000 to 6,000 subscribers in the Argentine city of Comodoro Rivadavia, which is located in Chubut Province. Comodoro Rivadavia, with a population of 124,151   
persons residing in 36,138 households, is the largest city in the Patagonia region of Argentina, and it is the center of  the Argentine oil and gas industry.  The addition of Comodoro TV will raise Tescorp’s subscriber count to approximately 58,000.  The Company continues to purchase strategically with a disciplined approach and has kept its average purchase price to approximately $600 per subscriber. 

<P>

By entering the Comodoro Rivadavia market, Tescorp believes it will solidify its position as the dominant cable television operator in the region.  In a large market such as Comodoro Rivadavia, the economies of scale achievable after a consolidation of the market provide an opportunity to achieve above-average operating margins and profitability.  The Company also believes, as a commercial center, Comodoro Rivadavia should be a good market for the sale of ancillary communication services.  

<P>

For the second quarter ended September 30, 1996, Tescorp reported that net revenues increased 43 percent to $5.5 million compared to the same period a year ago. System operating income before depreciation and amortization, a common measure of performance for cable television companies, increased 45 percent to $1.6 million during the same period of comparison. The increase in revenue and system operating income resulted primarily from the acquisition of additional cable television systems.  For the quarter, the Company recorded a net loss of $779,974 compared to a net loss of $536,841 during the same period of comparison.

<P>

Tescorp will continue to exploit its market position by making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, move to lead the convergence of telecommunications technologies, and explore opportunities in other Latin American markets which offer advantageous opportunities to early entrants.  At the same time, the Company continues to improve the service provided to existing subscribers.  Addressable converters have been introduced into a select market to further enhance tiering and additional pay revenues.  The Company believes that dedicated and consistent implementation of its acquisition and operating strategies will result in an escalation in the value of its existing systems.

<B>Third Quarter - 1996</B>
<P>
We would like to take this opportunity to update you on the substantial progress TBC has made during this past year. Early this year the Company established a number of operational goals to be accomplished during 1996. Not only has substantial advancement occurred in the clinical programs, but TBC has also achieved a number of milestones in the financial and corporate development areas.  Our achievements to-date are outlined below.
<P>
<B> Financing and Corporate Milestones</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>In February, the Company raised $13.9 million in a private offering.  The financing was led by Oracle Partners of New York and included New York Life, two of the most respected names in biotechnology investing.
<P>  
<LI>In October, TBC signed a long term development agreement with LG Chem, one of the largest companies in Korea.  As part of this agreement, LG Chem invested $5 million with the purchase of 1.25 million shares of common stock and will contribute approximately $10.7 million over five years to the development of both the endothelin and selectin antagonist programs.  Once approved, LG Chem will have the rights to market these compounds in Southeast Asia, excluding Japan.
1996 Clinical Milestones
<P>
<LI>A Phase III study of NOVASTAN® (argatroban),  TBC’s anti-clotting agent, was completed in November in patients suffering from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an immune reaction to heparin.  The Company is currently analyzing the data and anticipates filing a New Drug Application (NDA) for HIT with the  FDA by mid-1997.
<P>
<LI>In October, preliminary data from a Phase II acute myocardial infarction (MI) trial was presented at the 14th International Congress on Thrombosis in France.  This trial is one of four multi-center studies being conducted by TBC and Synthélabo (the European developer of argatroban) using NOVASTAN® as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy in acute MI.  Results from these acute MI trials should be available in early 1997.  Upon review of the results with Synthélabo, a joint decision regarding future trials will be made.
<P>
<LI>A key objective in 1996 was to advance TBC’s endothelin and selectin antagonist compounds into clinical development.  These therapeutics, discovered using the Company’s computer-aided drug design technology, are the first TBC-designed compounds to advance into human clinical trials:
<P>
<LI>TBC 11251, an endothelin A receptor antagonist, entered into human clinical testing in November, when the Company initiated a Phase I trial in the United Kingdom.  This compound may have substantial potential for the treatment of congestive heart failure.
<P>
<LI>TBC 1269, a selectin antagonist, represents a new class of immunomodulating agents and entered into human clinical testing in the United Kingdom in December.  Preclinical trials in animal models have demonstrated the ability of this compound to treat or prevent an asthmatic attack.</UL>

<P>
As 1996 comes to a close, the Company believes that it is well positioned to move forward with its research and clinical programs.  In addition to its portfolio of three compounds in human clinical trials, TBC’s drug discovery technology will be used to provide compounds with potential for further development.  The Company looks forward to reaching additional milestones, including the filing of its first NDA, continued development of other therapeutic programs, as well as establishing additional corporate alliances, all of which the Company believes will enhance shareholder value. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The increase in net loss during 1996 was a result of continued increases in research and development activities related to the clinical trials of NOVASTAN® and preclinical work on the endothelin and selectin compounds.  In addition, TBC received $2,000,000 during 1995 as a result of reaching a milestone in a research agreement with Eisai Co., Ltd. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Second Quarter 1996 Shareholders’ Report</B><BR>
Turner produced a net loss of $439,000, or $(0.25) per share after payment of preferred dividends during the first half of 1996.  The results include a $0.51 per share negative after-tax impact of a $5 million reserve taken in the second quarter relating to a construction project in Minneapolis.
<P>

The value of construction completed during the first half of 1996 was $1.54 billion, relatively unchanged from the same period in 1995.  Earnings from construction contracts were $31 million during the first six months of 1996 which is down from $34.6 million in the corresponding period in 1995.  This decline is attributable to the $5 million reserve taken on the Minneapolis project.
Losses from Real Estate operations for the first half of 1996 were $257,000 up from $98,000 in the first half of 1995.  The increase is primarily the result of income for real estate sales in 1995 which did not recur in 1996.
Interest expense for the first six months of 1996 decreased 14 percent from the corresponding period in 1995 due to lower debt levels.
At the end of the first quarter of 1996, the Company’s backlog value of construction to be completed was $4.22 billion and backlog earnings was $98.6 million, compared to $3.99 billion and $92.1 million respectively at December 31, 1995.
Among recent developments at your Company include the resignation of Alfred T. McNeill as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. McNeill’s 38 years of dedicated service to the Company and most recently his seven years of leadership as Chairman and CEO guided this Company through a very challenging period.  His leadership allowed Turner to emerge from one of the worst downturns in the real estate and building industries in our nation’s history with its preeminence intact and well positioned for the next century.
E. T. "Bud" Gravette, who has been a Turner Board member since 1981 is now serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 

<P>
<B>
Market Spotlight</B><BR>
New sales for the quarter of $958 million, represents a 30 percent increase over the strong prior quarter and a 40 percent increase over the second quarter of 1995.  During the first half of 1996 the Company recorded $1.85 billion of sales.  This is the highest level of first half sales in Company history.
<P>

Recent contracts awarded include, a new 370,000 square foot, 3-story high school on a 70 acre site in Carrollton, Texas.  Other projects in the education market include a new 3-story public high school on Staten Island in New York and a new 75,000 square foot chemistry teaching facility at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
Our Columbus office was awarded a contract from the Roxane division of Boehringer Ingelheim for a 220,000 square foot manufacturing, laboratory and warehouse space expansion.  Our New Jersey and Philadelphia offices were also awarded contracts in the pharmaceutical market by Johnson & Johnson and DuPont Merck, respectively.

<blockquote>To Our Shareholders:

<P>
I am pleased to report strong results for 3Com’s second fiscal quarter of 1997, ended November 30, 1996.
Our record performance reflects several important accomplishments including our strengthened leadership and increased market share at the edge of the network, mounting acceptance of our standards-based approach to solving networking bottlenecks in the core of the network, and our enhanced status and reputation in the industry.
<P>
For the quarter, sales increased 46% from the second fiscal quarter a year ago, to a record $820.3 million.  Net income of $105.6 million, or $.56 per share, included a non-tax deductible charge of $6.6 million associated with the acquisition of OnStream Networks, Inc., which closed during the quarter.  Results for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 have been restated for this acquisition.  Excluding non-recurring charges in both years, pro forma net income in the second quarter of fiscal 1997 was a record $112.2 million, or $.60 per share, compared to $65.6 million, or $.37 per share, posted in the year-ago quarter, representing growth of 62% in pro forma earnings per share.
<P>
Second quarter sales of systems products, including switches, hubs, internetworking, and remote access products, increased 41% year-over-year to $460.7 million, or 56% of total revenue.  Growth in our systems business, in part, reflects market share gains in workgroup switching, ATM switching, and stackable systems, as well as major new account wins with our High-Function CELLplex™ and ONcore® product lines.  Sales of network adapters increased 55% from the same quarter a year ago to $353.2 million, or 43% of the total.  Strength in our adapter business reflects our leadership position in the overall adapter market, as well as continued market share gains in Fast Ethernet and mobile computing products.
<P>
During the quarter, 3Com began shipping several new products, including new switching modules for the LANplex®, CELLplex, and ONcore High-Function Switches, as well as new additions to the SuperStack™ II line of stackable systems, including the SuperStack II Desktop Switch, priced at just $120 per port. The company also introduced Fast IP, 3Com’s strategy for providing IP switching across all types of network backbones, including Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, and ATM.  Fast IP combines the control-policy function of routing with the wire-speed forwarding performance of switching.
<P>
In November, 3Com began shipping new ATM wide-area network (WAN) access products acquired through OnStream Networks, which have been rebranded under our AccessBuilder® family.  In December, the company announced a strategic alliance with Acer Group, one of the world’s largest PC manufacturers, to integrate 3Com’s full line of networking products and technologies into Acer PC products and service offerings worldwide.  Initially, Acer will deliver PCs with 3Com network adapters as a system solution enabling users in corporate enterprise, small business and education to easily connect their computers into corporate LANs, WANs, Intranets or to the Internet.
<P>
Overall, at mid-point in our fiscal year, we are pleased with our performance.  While we are not without our share of challenges, the networking industry appears to be growing at a fast rate and we are well positioned to benefit from major technology trends, including switching, ATM and Fast Ethernet.  We have gained market share in key segments across our business, new product momentum is high and our competitive position in the industry continues to improve.  We appreciate your continued support and look forward to reporting on our progress as the second half of the year unfolds.

To Our Shareholders:	

<P>

The first quarter ended March 31 reflected a good start for our new Company.  We are pleased to report to you on a number of significant events and developments that have occurred since the beginning of the year.

<P>

<B>The Initial Public Offering</B> On February 9, 1996, 3-D Geophysical, Inc. completed its Initial Public Offering and simultaneously acquired four seismic data gathering businesses in the United States and Mexico.  After the underwriters exercised their overallotment option, the Company issued 4.6 million shares of Common Stock at $7.50 per share for a total Offering of $34.50 million before underwriters’ discounts and Offering expenses. The stock is listed on the NASDAQ national market and trades under the symbol "TDGO."

<P>

<B>Financial Achievements</B>	This is 3-D Geophysical’s first quarter as a public company, and the results are not comparable to the first quarter of 1995. Therefore, we will describe both the reported financial results as well as the pro forma statements.	Reported net sales were $7.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 1996, up from $2.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 1995.  On a pro forma basis, assuming all the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 1995, net sales increased to $10.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 1996 from $7.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 1995.  Reported net income after extraordinary items increased to $519,000, or $0.10 per share, in the three months ended March 31, 1996, versus $86,000 in the three months ended March 31, 1995.  On a pro forma basis, assuming all the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 1995, net income in the three months ended March 31, 1996 increased to $272,000, or $0.04 per share, from a loss of ($504,000), or ($0.07) per share, for the three months ended March 31, 1995. The Company recently closed a $18.0 million credit facility with First Interstate Bank of Texas, a subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank.  This credit facility has enabled TDGO to purchase approximately $9 million in equipment for work in Alaska and Mexico and increases the channel capacity of its Rocky Mountain operations.

<P>

<B>Operating Developments</B>  The Company has also made progress operationally since the beginning of 1996.  New agreements have been signed with BP Exploration Alaska, ARCO Alaska and Marathon Oil as well as the largest land 3-D contract to date with PEMEX in Mexico.  With these new contracts and other agreements, the Company currently has a backlog of approximately $35 million.  Although contracts for services may be modified or canceled by a customer on short notice and without penalty, we believe this backlog is firm and expect to complete it in 1996. 3-D Geophysical has recently increased its recording channel capacity by more than 50 percent.  Including equipment purchased in the last quarter of 1995, the Company has increased its channel capacity from 5,200 channels to 10,500 channels.  We have made substantial progress in integrating TDGO’s four hitherto separate regional operating units.  For example, personnel from Mexico have worked in Texas and California, and staff from Colorado have worked in Mexico, California, Ohio and Texas.  We have also moved equipment among each of the Company’s four regional markets. Cost savings and other administrative efficiencies are also being realized.  The Company has integrated all of its insurance plans in the United States and is in the process of integrating all of its U.S. employee benefit plans.  We estimate that the Company will save approximately $400,000 annually from this consolidation while at the same time improving the benefits for our employees. We are in the process of installing an advanced technology management information system which will provide up-to-date information on the Company’s far flung operations. Among its features is the ability to centrally track equipment utilization, which helps management to improve the Company’s return on its capital investment. 

<P>

<B>New Markets</B> The Company remains committed to a strategy of entering new markets as well as expanding in existing markets.  New markets are currently being opened in Peru and other South American countries, and business is expanding markedly in Alaska and Mexico. We are also exploring expansion into other regions and continue to review acquisition opportunities that have the potential to augment the Company’s current operations.  

<P>

<B>Conclusion</B>	3-D Geophysical has made substantial progress to date.  In our first 105 days as a public company, we have accomplished many of the initial goals that we set for  ourselves.  We thank you for your support and look forward to continuing these efforts successfully in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

<CENTER><B>1996 Third Quarter <BR>
Report to Shareholders</B></CENTER>
<P>


<B>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:</B>
<P>

       We are pleased to report record sales and 
earnings for the third quarter of 1996.
<P>

       Net income rose to a third quarter record of 
$5,902,000, or $.55 per share, as compared to 
$4,702,000, or $.46 per share a year ago.  Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 1996, increased to $129,611,000, from $128,750,000 last year, a record for any quarter in the Company’s history.
     
<P>
Nine month net income for 1996 increased to $12,975,000, or $1.22 per share, from $10,166,000, or $1.00 per share a year ago.  Net sales for the first nine months of this year rose to $381,003,000, versus $373,726,000 in the comparable 1995 period.  
   
<P>
  These earnings achievements were led by the Lighting Group’s continued improvement in efficiencies and cost reduction programs in their manufacturing operations.  Sales were boosted by stronger performances from the Consumer and Canadian Divisions.  In the third quarter, the Lighting Group opened a new distribution center in the Chicago area, which will reinforce their competitive position in the Midwest.
  
<P>
   For the Compressor and Vacuum Pump Group, sales and operating income for the quarter improved over last year’s levels. In August, their Monroe, Louisiana, Operation was officially notified that it is being recommended for ISO 9001 registration (the international standard for quality), which will make it the Group’s fourth major manufacturing facility to be registered.  
  
<P>
   We expect to see continued improvement for the Company in 1997, based on new applications for our products and growth prospects in certain markets we serve.
    
<P>
 On October 17, 1996, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.10 per share, payable January 1, 1997, to shareholders of record December 6, 1996.  This will be the 166th consecutive quarterly cash dividend paid by the Company. </BLOCKQUOTE>

To Our Stockholders:
<P>
Sales of $13,118,000 for the third quarter were lower than the $24,217,000 reported in the same quarter of 1995.  The Company reported a net loss of $5,478,000 or $0.70 per share for the third quarter as compared with net income of $1,383,000 or $0.17 per share in the same quarter of 1995. Without the excess inventory reserve taken in the third quarter, the Company would have had a net loss of $1,179,000 or  $0.15 per share for the third quarter.
<P>
For the first nine months of 1996, sales were $45,657,000 as compared with sales of $70,805,000 for the same period of 1995. The Company had a net loss for the first nine months of $4,586,000 or $0.59 per share as compared with net income of $7,516,000 or $0.93 per share for the same period of 1995. Without the excess inventory reserve taken in the third quarter, the Company would have had a net loss of $287,000 or  $0.04 per share for the first nine months of 1996.
<P>
Despite the overall loss for the first nine months, the Company generated $8,766,000 in cash flow from operations compared to $989,000 for the same nine-month period in 1995. As a result, our balance sheet continues to have strength. We have nearly $10 million in cash, unused committed credit facilities of over $20 million, and no long-term debt. Although our production output may reach record levels in 1997, our capital expenditure needs in 1997 will be modest. As a result, we have been committing, and will continue to commit, a significant amount of our resources to research and development.
<P>
The third quarter results reflect the impact of the program phase-outs that we announced earlier. Although this has been a very disappointing year, we feel we have passed a critical point and can look forward with optimism. There are several new programs that we plan to enter into production in the next few quarters. As a result, the fourth quarter will likely show some revenue improvement over the third quarter, and the Company should be well positioned next year for achieving its plan of having revenues return to 1995 levels or better.
<P>
I have stated before that we are an emerging technology company. This is true more today than ever before. As I searched for the words to convey this to you, I came across an article authored by Dan Schott, our own Vice President of Research and Development. The article appeared in a recent issue of our employee newsletter, The Viewing Angle. Dan's words say it clearly: 
<P>
<CENTER>THE R&D LAB - DEVELOPING OUR FUTURE </CENTER>
<P>
by Dan SchottMany of you may have noticed changes occurring on the west wing of the second floor and have probably wondered what is going on. Central to these changes is the creation of a Research and Development Laboratory which is independent from LCD production and the prototype labs.  We have in essence created an off-line group that is expected to think “outside of the box”.  The significance of this lab therefore goes far beyond the facility itself. It signifies a real commitment toward our future - a future rich with opportunities for better displays, new applications, totally new markets, and exciting growth.
<P>
Three-Five is in an extraordinary position to exploit the future growth that is certain to occur in display technology. Our investment in a state-of-the art LCD manufacturing line allows us to capitalize on our R&D by being able to quickly take the output of R&D, and convert it into high-volume production. In fact, we are in a unique position to do so, since we have the largest and one of the most modern LCD production facilities in North America.
<P>
The list of new opportunities is expansive. We have the unrealized potential of the line to produce very lightweight displays, using extremely thin or otherwise “light-weight” substrates. And we are expanding the line's capability to include larger, high-information content panels, similar to those found in computer terminals. Work is also proceeding to provide these displays in full color. 
<P>
But the really exciting future lies with budding opportunities that can be unique to Three-Five and which will allow us to stand above our competitors. This can include areas that give our customers a competitive edge, or ones which open up entirely new markets that do not exist today. For example, imagine color displays that require virtually no power, that could be used in calculators, pagers, cellular phones, PDAs, etc. Or passive LCD displays, like the ones we currently make, that have performance comparable to active displays and which can display video information with gray scale. Or tiny, inexpensive displays capable of presenting as much information as is on a computer screen, and that can be projected onto a large screen, or even worn and viewed through viewfinder-type optics. Indeed, the future is bright and the new R&D lab will play a large role in developing our future business. Stay tuned for the exciting developments.
<P>
Until next quarter...

<CENTER><H2>Third Quarter 1996 Report</H2></CENTER>

<P>

 Dear Fellow Shareholder,

<P>

TouchStone Software continued to improve its quarter to quarter performance during the period ended September 30, 1996.  With our strong retail sales during the period and the new products we have introduced, including FastMove! with ZIPSync and the e.support product family, we see an encouraging trend.  In addition, we maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and investments of $14.5 million.

<P>

Revenues for the quarter were $2.5 million, compared with $3.5 million in the same period a year ago.  The company reported a loss of $355,000, or $0.05 per share on 7.7 million shares outstanding in the quarter, versus net income of $479,000, or $0.07 per share on 7.3 million shares outstanding in the third quarter of 1995.   Third-quarter revenue was up from the second-quarter level of $1.7 million.

<P>

PC-cillin 95, our five-star award-winning anti-virus product, once again led sales for the quarter.  Revenues from CheckIt Diagnostic Kit, the advanced troubleshooter for Windows 95, remained firm, and the performance of WINCheckIt, our "all-in-one" problem-solver for Windows applications, was better than expected.

<P>

During the quarter the company introduced FastMove! with ZIPSync, the new 2.0 version of its popular file synchronization and transfer program.  The product has attracted a backlog of orders and is the first to transfer, synchronize and back up files on removable cartridge drives such as the Iomega Zip and Syquest EZ drives.  
 
<P>

We distributed software last week to initial vendor sites for our new e.support product family, which is designed to provide personal-computer users with a convenient method of requesting support from vendors via modem or the Internet, while reducing vendor support costs and increasing efficiency.  The company continues to provide trial versions of the e.support end-user application to users via the Internet at www.esupport.com.  We expect the new software products, which we developed under the direction of the Software Support Professionals Association, to help the company continue to improve its operating results.

<P>

Revenues for the nine months were $4.9 million, compared with $9.7 million for the same period a year ago.  The loss for the nine-month period was $4.3 million, or $.57 per share on 7.5 million shares outstanding.  In the same period of 1995, the company reported net income of $1.3 million, or $.19 per share on 6.9 million shares outstanding.

<P>

With our approach of providing simple solutions to complex problems, TouchStone is strongly situated to participate in the expanding, consumer-driven computer market.  We believe this approach, augmented by our strong retail distribution channels and our sound financial condition, positions the company well for continued growth and a return to profitability.

<P>

Sincerely,

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>TPC CORPORATION REPORTS HIGHER 3RD QUARTER '96 REVENUE AND NET INCOME</B></CENTER>

<P>

 	Houston, Texas (October 30, 1996) -- TPC Corporation (AMEX: TPC) today reported significantly higher revenue, operating income and net income for both the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 1996, compared to the prior year periods.  Revenues in the third quarter of 1996 were $151,020,000 compared to $65,452,000 in the third quarter last year while third quarter 1996 operating income increased more than 60% to $5,025,000 compared to $3,101,000 in the third quarter of 1995.  Net income for the third quarter of 1996 was $1,715,000, or $.09 per share, compared with a loss of $693,000, or $.05 per share, for the third quarter of 1995.
	
<P>
In discussing the third quarter results, TPC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry W. Bickle said, "These earnings reflect the increasing assimilation of the acquired Seagull assets in our gas gathering and processing business, the continued progress in developing our salt cavern gas storage projects, and the growth in our gas marketing business around these strategic assets."  Bickle also indicated his belief that the current favorable trends result from a sharper operating focus on "basic blocking and tackling."
	
<P>
TPC's Gathering and Processing segment reported operating income of $2,915,000 in the third quarter of 1996 compared to $1,406,000 in the third quarter of 1995.  Throughput volumes in TPC's gathering systems in the third quarter of 1996 increased to 80.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) from 31.8 Bcf in the 1995 quarter due principally to the acquisition of seven offshore gathering systems from Seagull Energy Corporation in September 1995.  TPC's share of natural gas liquids sold from the processing plant acquired in the Seagull transaction was 9.3 million gallons in the third quarter of 1996.
	
<P>
TPC's Gas Marketing segment reported operating income of $1,263,000 in the third quarter of 1996 compared to $375,000 in the year ago quarter.  Marketed volumes in the third quarter of 1996 increased to 51.4 Bcf from 39.3 Bcf in the third quarter of 1995 while comparative unit gross margins between these periods increased approximately 23% to nearly 3.7¢ per Mcf.

<P>

TPC's Gas Storage segment reported third quarter 1996 operating income of $847,000 compared to $1,320,000 in the third quarter of 1995.  Included in this segment is TPC's equity in the earnings of its Market Hub Partners (MHP) affiliate, which amounted to $1,002,000 in the third quarter of 1996 compared to $921,000 in the third quarter last year.  Although MHP achieved a significant increase in operating income, the benefit was largely offset by a nonrecurring $452,000 charge to earnings on the early extinguishment of debt in a combination acquisition/financing transaction which closed on July 3, 1996.
	
<P>
On a non-operating basis, TPC's interest expense increased to $3,310,000 in the third quarter of 1996 from $1,071,000 in the 1995 third quarter, due primarily to the issuance of new debt incurred in connection with the Seagull transaction in September 1995.  Since completing the acquisition of the Seagull assets, TPC’s total debt to total capitalization ratio has been reduced from 76% to 58% as of September 30, 1996.
	
<P>
As previously announced, TPC recognized a gain of approximately $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax) on the sale of a 50% interest in the Moss Bluff Gas Storage Facility in Liberty County, Texas.  The interest was originally sold by TPC to CMS Gulf Coast Storage Company (CMS) in 1994; however, due to certain mutual options that remained outstanding from that transaction, the gain to TPC of approximately $6 million on the original sale was deferred.  The July 3, 1996 purchase from CMS by TPC's 66% owned affiliate, MHP, for $26.6 million effectively canceled those options, allowing TPC to recognize the gain on the original sale after eliminating the portion attributable to its ownership interest in MHP.  The unrecognized portion of the original gain, amounting to approximately $3.7 million, will be reflected in TPC's future earnings at the rate of approximately $450,000 per year through the year 2003.  MHP now owns 100% of the Moss Bluff Gas Storage Facility.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote>
Dear Shareholder:

<P>

Net revenues for the quarter ended July 31, 1996 increased $382,000 to $19,236,000 from $18,854,000 in the prior year's period.  Income for the three months, before recording an extraordinary loss, was $292,000 or $.04 per share as compared to $1,084,000 or $.16 per share for the same period in 1995.  While the gross profit margin remained fairly steady at 54%, increases in selling, general and administrative costs ($1,172,000) and interest expense ($314,000) negatively impacted results of operations for the period as compared with the prior year. SG&A expenses for the period included a non-recurring charge of $456,000.  In addition, the Company recorded a $1,342,000 or $.19 per share one-time, non-cash, after-tax, extraordinary charge resulting in a net loss for the period of ($1,050,000) or ($.15) per share.  The extraordinary charge relates to the write-off of the deferred financing costs associated with refinancing our former $35 million credit facility with a new $100 million senior credit facility underwritten by Bankers Trust as Agent Bank.	For the nine months ended July 31, 1996, Transworld reported an increase of $2,795,000 in total revenues to $56,402,000 as compared to $53,607,000 in the same period of the last fiscal year.  Income for the nine month period, before the extraordinary loss, was $1,232,000 or $.18 per share as compared to $3,393,000 or $.49 per share for the same period in fiscal 1995.  Higher SG&A expenses (an increase of $3,679,000) and interest expenses (an increase of $1,219,000) along with increased amortization charges and the extraordinary charge produced a net loss of ($110,000) or ($.02) per share.
	
<P>
As we previously reported, Transworld completed a new $100 million senior credit facility replacing the $35 million facility.  I am also pleased to inform you that concurrent with the closing of the new credit facility, the Company also concluded the previously announced Unit Purchase Agreement with Hyperion Partners II L.P. ("HP II") and repaid the $10 million subordinated loan made to it by HP II in January 1996.
	
<P>
Our new expanded  credit facility provides Transworld with financial resources at favorable costs and terms with significantly more flexibility than the facility it replaces.  This $100 million facility, combined with $66 million in shareholders' equity, gives Transworld the financial strength and banking partnership to reinvigorate our growth and acquisition activities.  As the alternate site healthcare service industry continues to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions of small and large companies, we believe there are opportunities for Transworld to build a strong, multi-modality products and services network through expansion and integration in our targeted region.
	
<P>
We recently announced that David Golush and Robert Zalaznick have joined our Board of Directors, increasing the Board's size from four to six members.  Mr. Golush is currently a Managing Director of Ranieri & Co., Inc., an officer of direct and indirect subsidiaries of Hyperion Partners and HP II  and a Director of Bank United Corp.  Robert Zalaznick is currently the Administrator of the Gene Therapy Core Facility at the New York Hospital - Cornell Medical Center and concurrently, the Divisional Administrator, Department of Medicine/Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.  With these additions, we gain considerable business skills and corporate governance expertise.
	
<P>
On August 15, Joseph J. Raymond resigned as Chairman of the Board of Directors.  The entire Transworld family wishes him well in his new endeavors and thanks him for his many contributions to the Company.  Scott Shay, a current Director, was named acting Chairman of the Board of Directors.

<P>

Sincerely,

<P>

TRIDENT MICROSYSTEMS REPORTS<BR>
 RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER<BR>
 REVENUE UP 23% </B></CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mountain View, California, October 17, 1996, -- Trident Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: TRID) today announced sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 were $44,838,000 compared to $44,168,000 for the prior quarter and $36,566,000 for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.  Net income for the first quarter was $3,525,000 or $0.26 per share compared to $1,619,000 or $0.12 per share for the prior quarter and net income of $4,505,000 or $0.34 per share for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.  Net income for the prior quarter was reduced  $4,000,000 or approximately $0.20 per share after tax by a lower cost or market inventory adjustment. Weighted average common shares for the quarter totaled 13,626,000, versus 13,348,000 in the prior quarter and 13,314,000 for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

"We are pleased to see both revenue growth and the increased design activity of our new mobile products," said Frank Lin, president and CEO.  "During the quarter, mobile revenues totaled over 33 percent of sales, as customers like IBM, NEC, Fujitsu, and Seiko-Epson increased their production of new Pentium class notebook computers.  This represents continued growth for these 64-bit video graphics products which have higher average selling prices than comparable desktop products."

<P>

Mr. Lin continued, "As expected, we saw slow sales in the Asia-Pacific market during the summer months of July and August.  But we saw a return to strong demand for desktop 64-bit video graphics during the later part of August and September.  During the quarter, we also started volume shipments of the ProVidia9685, which is among the industry’s highest performing 64-bit video graphics products for the desktop, and the only one to include Trident’s industry leading TV-Out functionality.  Trident is a pioneer in this technology, which allows computers to output to both TVs and computer monitors, enabling new applications like PC home entertainment and low-cost web browsing.

<P>

"Intel and Microsoft have developed strategies to provide a cost-effective computing environment for 3D applications later this year and in the beginning of 1997.  We have just announced our next family of video graphics chips, 3DImàge, which is being architected for 3D and which will support the introductions of MMX processors and the Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) from Intel and Direct 3D from Microsoft.  We are very excited about our 3DImàge975 and the 3DImàge975DVD, which we announced this week, and which we believe will set new standards of performance and integration for 3D products."

<P>

"In the prior quarter," commented James T. Lindstrom, vice president and chief financial officer, "we took a lower cost or market reserve to adjust the value of certain 64-bit video graphics products.  This quarter, we were pleased to see strong demand for these products, which we expect will lead to the sale of this inventory by the end of November, ahead of our original internal projections."

<P>

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $44.9 million as of September 30, 1996, from $41.2 million as of June 30, 1996.  The Company expects to make additional capital contributions to UICC, a foundry venture of $30 million and $15 million in March 1997, and the middle of calendar 1997, respectively.  Accounts receivable increased from the June 30, 1996, period by $1.8 million primarily because of higher sales levels in the last month of the quarter.  Inventory decreased during the period by $4.2 million primarily reflecting the shipment of certain 64-bit products which had been in inventory at the beginning of the period.   Accounts payable decreased by $6.0 million primarily reflecting payments to foundries for product received in prior periods.

<P>

Statements regarding future sales of products, market trends and future product introductions are forward looking statements and actual results are subject to certain risks and could vary depending upon a number of factors, including, in particular, trends in the PC industry, Trident’s ability to design and timely introduce new products, design wins and competitive pressures, including pricing and competitor’s new product introductions.

<P>

Trident Microsystems, Inc. designs, develops and markets integrated circuit graphical user interface accelerators, graphics controllers, and multimedia video processors for IBM-compatible PCs.

Dear Shareholder:
<P>

<B> TEP Reports Strong Third Quarter Results</B><BR>
Tucson Electric Power Company’s (TEP) net income was $102.5 million or $3.19 per average share of common stock for the quarter ending September 30, 1996, as compared to $60.7 million or $1.89 per average share of common stock for the same period in 1995.
Consistent with the Company’s continuing improvement in profitability, TEP recognized tax benefits associated with losses generated in prior periods. These tax benefits offset future taxable income and reduce future taxes payable. For the third quarter of 1996, these benefits totaled $70.3 million and were partially offset by $22.1 million of current period income tax expense for a net income tax benefit of $48.2 million, or $1.50 per share.
<P>

Earnings for the twelve months ending September 30, 1996 were $119.3 million or $3.71 per share, as compared to $39.0 million or $1.21 per share for the same period in 1995. Net income tax benefits included in the most recent 12-month results were $84.3 million or $2.62 per share. 
<P>

Excluding various one-time items, the Company’s pre-tax operating income for the 12-month period increased $21.1 million or 18% over pre-tax operating income for the same period in 1995.  Similarly, related operating margins (adjusted operating income as a percent of total revenue) for the two comparable 12-month periods increased from 18% for 1995 to 21% for 1996.
This improvement in earnings is attributable to, among other things, the following:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>3% growth in number of customers served; 
<LI>1.6% increase in electricity usage per customer; and
<LI>1.1% retail rate increase implemented March 31, 1996.
</UL>
<P>

<B>Arizona Moving Towards Competition</B><BR>
On October 9, 1996 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) proposed rules that would "phase-in" competition by giving customers a choice of electric service providers.
<P>

This framework for a more competitive structure remains subject to public comment and ACC approval prior to becoming effective. The ACC has scheduled public comment meetings on the rules throughout Arizona in early December and may vote to approve the Proposed Rule. 
<P>

The Proposed Rule would begin phasing in retail competition in January 1999 when TEP, along with certain other Arizona utilities, would be required to give a percentage of its customers a choice of their electric service provider.  Beginning January 1, 1999, customers representing 20% of TEP’s 1995 peak demand would be eligible to choose their electric supplier.
On January 1, 2001, electric service provider choice would be given to customers representing 50% of TEP’s 1995 peak demand. And, by January 1, 2003, all retail customers would be eligible to choose their electric service provider.
<P>

Overall, TEP believes that competition is the appropriate path and that certain regulatory reforms are necessary to make it a reality in Arizona. On November 7, 1996, TEP filed its first set of comments to the previously described Proposed Rule. In its filing TEP recommends that the ACC should resolve the many complicated issues of deregulation prior to adoption, including recovery of stranded investment, insuring equal treatment of all participants and maintaining a safe and reliable system.
<P>

<B>Forging Ahead</B><BR>
In recent years initiatives to deregulate the energy market and introduce competition have altered the manner in which utilities approach their business. TEP has embraced these changes and has taken steps to "forge ahead" in the increasingly competitive energy environment.
<P>

TEP intends to continue taking advantage of emerging opportunities in the energy markets to the benefit of both shareholders and customers. TEP is involved with three notable energy-related ventures:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Nations Energy Corp.;
<LI>New Energy Ventures; and
<LI>Global Solar Energy, L.L.C. 
</UL>
<P>

New Energy Ventures (NEV), based in California, serves as a buyer’s agent for companies and other entities seeking to lower their electricity costs. TEP has an option to purchase a 50% stake in NEV, and we believe our association with NEV positions TEP as a key participant in the deregulated energy markets.
<P>

During the recent quarter, NEV signed additional contracts to provide energy services to large groups of customers beginning January 1, 1998, when California begins to "phase-in" retail competition. NEV also announced a purchase power agreement with Bonneville Power Administration for 200 MW of firm capacity and options for additional amounts for five years, commencing on January 1, 1998. This agreement represents a positive step for NEV in securing competitive, low-cost electric power for its customers.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>ULTRATECH STEPPER Q3 1996 REPORT</B>   </CENTER>

<P>


To Our Stockholders:

<P>

Although the third quarter of 1996 offered many challenges related to the current industry environment, Ultratech remained focused on its competitive positioning, customer needs and long-term stockholder value, which allowed us to post solid results.  For the three-month period, net sales reached $46.5 million, up from $42.2 million in the same quarter last year, while net income  rose to $8.8 million, up from $6.8 million last year.  For the nine-month period, revenue reached $150.0 million, a 36 percent increase over the same period last year.  Net income for the first nine months of 1996 was up 65 percent to $26.8 million.  These third quarter results represent a record 54.5 percent gross margin, primarily attributed to a favorable product mix and higher average selling prices.

<P>

<CENTER><B>Market diversification drives performance in challenging environment</B></CENTER>

<P>

As evidenced by our results, the product diversification strategy we implemented early in the decade continues to serve us well, especially during the semiconductor industry’s current downturn.  Despite the impact this slowdown has had on our mix-and-match products, and to a lesser degree our scanner replacement and low-cost IC stepper shipments, sales of our thin film head (TFH) products remained very strong—partially offsetting softer sales in the semiconductor sector.

<P>

In response to the disk drive industry’s increased demand for cost-effective, yield-enhancing methods of manufacturing magneto resistive (MR) heads, this quarter we introduced our next-generation TFH lithography system, the Model 6700.  Customers have responded favorably to the system, primarily due to its i-line capability, which addresses the advanced process requirements for MR and giant MR head production without sacrificing the cost or throughput mandates so vital to this sector.  

<P>

Sales for our Model 1700 stepper were also solid during the quarter.  The Model 1700 addresses the back-end portion of the TFH manufacturing process, which involves the contouring and pole trimming of the MR heads.  In addition to strengthening our diversification within the TFH arena, this increased interest in the Model 1700 broadens our reach into new international markets since sales for these back-end processes stem primarily from Malaysia, Thailand and the Pacific Rim.  In addition, the micromachining market proved to be important for Ultratech this quarter.  Our tools are being called upon to create minute parts for a variety of electromechanical applications.

<P>

<CENTER><B>Leasing program broadens customer reach</B></CENTER>

<P>

The leasing program we announced earlier this year has already begun to bear fruits for Ultratech.  Under this new financing strategy, chipmakers are able to lease the lithography tools they require, with minimal commitment to the capital outlays typically associated with major equipment purchases.  To date, we have found that this lease activity has allowed us to reach additional levels of management within our customer organizations.  We believe that this quick access to key decision makers has helped us penetrate new accounts and may lead to even more new customer relationships down the road.  While the initial lease activity is focused solely in the United States, we plan to transition the program to an international scope in the future. 

<P>

<CENTER><B>Lithography solutions for the next wave of growth</B></CENTER>

<P>

Consistent with our charter to bring innovative and efficient lithography solutions to market, we continue to fund major R&D projects that will take us into the next millennium.  The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography program that we are pursuing is an example of this strategy and action.  As one of the system pioneers of this technology, we believe that EUV lithography can be the solution of choice for manufacturers needing sub 0.13 micron production capabilities.  Similarly, our Projection Gas Immersion Laser Doping (P-GILD) project is proceeding on schedule.   We expect to have our first production version of the system completed in early 1997.  

<P>

Moving forward, we will continue to pursue opportunities within our target markets as well as invest in potentially promising new technologies.  I look forward to updating you on our progress in optimizing customer and stockholder value.<P>

<CENTER><B><U>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</U></B></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><B>UNITED AMERICAN HEALTHCARE <BR>REPORTS 90% INCREASE IN REVENUES FOR FIRST QUARTER</B></CENTER>

<P>

Detroit, MI, November 12, 1996 -- <B>U</B>nited<B> A</B>merican <B>H</B>ealthcare Corporation <B>(NYSE:UAH)</B>, one of the leaders in Medicaid managed care, today reported revenues increased 90% in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 to $33.6 million, from $17.7 million for the same period last year.  The Company broke even on an earnings per share basis in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, compared to earnings of $0.22 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

HMO medical premiums were $18.1 million, of which $15.4 million is related to OmniCare-TN and the remaining $2.7 million related to UltraMedix. The Company did not record medical premiums in fiscal 1995, as it did not own a majority interest in any HMO.

<P>

Management fees were $9.8 million during the first quarter of fiscal 1997, a decrease of $4.4 million from the first quarter of fiscal 1996. The entire decrease is attributable to the Company’s purchase of a majority interest in OmniCare-TN and UltraMedix in January 1996.  The Company recognized management fees from these entities of approximately $4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 1995.  For the three months ended September 30, 1996, management fee revenue and other intercompany transactions with these entities were eliminated in the consolidation process.

<P>

Management fees for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 were also impacted by decreased operating revenues of OmniCare-MI due primarily to a net decrease in premium and enrollment rates of approximately 2%, no recognition of management fees generated by the Company’s administration of OmniCare-MI’s coordination of benefits program, and a decrease in premium rates at PPC - Ohio of roughly 15%.  These decreases were offset by increased operating revenues of PPC - Ohio due to an approximate 59% increase in enrollment in that plan.

<P>

Commission and service fees increased 67% from $3.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1996 to $5.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1997.  Commission and service fees relate primarily to the activities of Corporate Healthcare Finance (CHF) and represent contract renewals and new contracts.  Approximately $1.2 million, or over 50% of the 67% increase in commission and service fees is related to new contracts signed by SBMC in the Company’s initiative of applying managed care principles to the worker’s compensation market.  

<P>

 "With a 90% increase in revenues in the first quarter, we at UAH are committed to continuing our programs towards greater profitability and continued success," said Dr. Julius V. Combs, chairman and chief executive officer of United American Healthcare.  "We continue to review each of our businesses in order to create the most value for shareholders as exhibited by our recent withdrawal from the HealthChoices program in Pennsylvania."

<P>

United American Healthcare is a full-service healthcare management company. It manages four HMOs under long-term contracts. The Company, through Baltimore-based Corporate Healthcare Financing, also provides management and advisory services to companies who self-fund their benefit plans.  UAH also operates a Preferred Provider network under the name ChoiceOne.

<CENTER><B>UFP Technologies Announces 3rd Quarter 1996 Results</B>
<P>

<I>Pre-tax income more than doubles</I>
<P></CENTER>


 GEORGETOWN, MA  (October 21, 1996). UFP Tech-nologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: UFPT), a manufacturer of pack-aging and specialty products, today reported a profit of $302,000 or $.06 per share for the quarter ending Sep-tember 30, 1996, compared to a profit of $235,000 or $.05 per share for the third quarter of 1995. Pre-tax income grew 114% from $235,000 in the 3rd quarter of 1995 to $503,000 in the 3rd quarter of 1996.  Sales for the quarter were $10.1 million, a 20% increase over 1995 third quar-ter sales of $8.4 million.  For the nine months ending September 30, 1996, the company reported a profit of $674,000 or $.14 per share on sales of $28.9 million versus a profit of $317,000 or $.07 per share on sales of $25.3 million for the corresponding period in 1995.

<P>

"We are pleased to report continued, steady progress, resulting in another record quarter for both sales and profits," said R. Jeffrey Bailly, President/CEO of UFP Technologies, Inc.  "Compared to the third quarter of 1995, sales are up 20% and operating income is up 85%.  Gross profits have improved measurably and, on a year-to-date basis, net earnings have more than doubled."

<P>

"Our Iowa Moulded Fibre plant start-up has been excep-tionally smooth," Bailly said.  "The facility began ship-ping product in late June, and is now profitable.  We are currently in the process of doubling its capacity to meet continuing demand for our recycled paper packaging products."

<P>

"Our core plastics packaging and specialty businesses turned in solid quarters as well, in spite of a relatively soft July and August," Bailly continued.  "In particular, the Specialty Products Division has experienced strong growth within the sports and leisure market."

<P>

UFP Technologies is an innovative designer and manu-facturer of a broad range of high performance cushion packaging and specialty foam and plastic products for industrial and consumer markets, and precision moulded fibre packaging products made primarily from 100 per-cent recycled paper.  The company’s Moulded Fibre Technology Division is a leader in the emerging market for environmentally sound interior packaging and has achieved a growing customer base including Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Motorola.  

<P>

Headquartered in Georgetown, Mass., UFP Technologies employs 337 people in its ten regional facilities.

<B>UGI Reports 39% Increase In Second Quarter Earnings</B>
<P>


VALLEY FORGE, Pa., May 2, 1996 -- UGI Corp. (NYSE: UGI), a holding company with propane distribution, utility and energy marketing subsidiaries, reported its second quarter net income rose 39% over the same period a year ago.

<P>

Net income for the quarter ended March 31 increased to $37,600,000, or $1.13 a share, from $27,000,000, or 83 cents a share, in the corresponding 1995 period.

<P>

Revenues more than doubled to $573,500,000, due primarily to the consolidation of the results of AmeriGas Partners, L.P. (NYSE: APU) in UGI’s financial statements.  UGI, through subsidiaries, owns 58% of AmeriGas Partners which is the nation’s largest propane marketer.  The 1996 revenues also included those of UGI’s new subsidiary, UGI Enterprises, an energy marketer.

<P>

Lon R. Greenberg, president and chief executive officer, said the pre-tax income contribution of the utility operations rose 33% to $37,800,000.  In last year’s second quarter, the utilities contributed pre-tax earnings of $28,400,000.

<P>

Greenberg attributed the utility earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter entirely to Gas Division operations which continued to benefit from colder weather and higher base rates.  The weather in the Gas Division’s service territory was 4.7% colder than normal, he said, and 11.4% colder than a year ago.

<P>

He said that the pre-tax earnings contribution from consolidated propane operations in the quarter increased 65% to $32,600,000 from $19,800,000 in the 1995 period.

<P>

The second quarter of 1995 included $2,900,000 in management fee income from Petrolane Incorporated, UGI’s former 35%-owned propane operation.

<P>

Retail propane sales from all operations increased 17% in the period, due primarily to colder weather
 and non-weather-related volume growth, he said.  The weather across national markets was approximately normal, but 19% colder than last year’s second quarter.

<P>

Unit margins were essentially the same as in the prior-year period, despite higher 1996 product costs, and higher than in fiscal 1996’s first quarter.  Operating expenses increased from a year ago.

<P>

He said propane’s earnings contribution in the recent period included $4,500,000 before taxes from an expected insurance premium refund and lower required environmental reserves.

<P>

The operations of Petrolane and UGI’s wholly owned subsidiary AmeriGas Propane, Inc. were combined in April 1995 to form AmeriGas Partners.  In last year’s second quarter, UGI recorded net income of $1,600,000, or 5 cents a share, from Petrolane.

<P>

Greenberg said UGI Enterprises recorded pre-tax income of $3,000,000 in the quarter on revenues of $26,500,000 from its unregulated energy marketing activities.

<P>

UGI’s net income for the six months ended March 31 increased 59.9% to $55,800,000, or $1.69 a share, from $34,900,000, or $1.07 a share, in the same period a year ago.  Results in the 1995 period included a 10-cent charge for a change in accounting for postemployment benefits.  Revenues for the six months more than doubled to $997,200,000 from $453,700,000 in the first half of 1995.

<CENTER>UNITEL VIDEO REPORTS FISCAL 1996 FOURTH<BR>
QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS<BR>
- Fiscal 1997 Results to-Date Reflect Benefits of Restructuring -</B></CENTER>

<P>

New York, New York, November 25, 1996 --- Unitel Video, Inc. (ASE:UNV) today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year-ended August 31, 1996.

<P>

Revenues for the fourth quarter ended August 31, 1996 were $16,537,000 compared to $20,640,000 reported in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.  During the fourth quarter, the Company incurred a net loss of ($1,977,000), or ($0.75) per share, compared to a net loss of ($6,238,000), or ($2.41) per share, during the fourth quarter ended August 31, 1995.  The weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding for the fourth quarter of 1996 was 2,628,000, compared with 2,593,000 in the comparable 1995 period.

<P>

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 1996, revenues were $79,287,000 compared with $83,285,000 for the 1995 fiscal year.  After giving effect to $3,246,000 of restructuring and impairment charges, the Company reported a net loss for the fiscal year of ($5,124,000), or ($1.96) per share as compared to a net loss, including restructuring and impairment charges of $8,081,000, of ($6,547,000), or ($2.53) per share, in the 1995 fiscal year.  The weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding for fiscal 1996 was 2,613,000, compared with 2,582,000 in the 1995 fiscal year.

<P>

The Company also announced the sale for $1,400,000 of its Editel New York film-to-tape transfer equipment with the acquiror assuming responsibility for all remaining real estate leases relating to the Editel New York facility.  Proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt.  The remaining equipment from the Editel New York business will be either sold or transferred to the Company’s other facilities by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 1997.

<P>

Commenting on the results, Barry Knepper, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The losses incurred in the fourth quarter and fiscal year reflect the Company’s ongoing initiatives to focus its resources on those operations which have the greatest profitability.  During the year we closed the Chicago and New York Editel facilities and sold equipment from those facilities which were not re-deployed into other of the Company’s divisions.  We relocated the Editel New York sound department to the Company’s Windsor division and successfully expanded our Editel Los Angeles post-production and special effects facilities with equipment from Editel New York and Editel Chicago.

<P>

"The elimination of unprofitable operations allowed the Company to commence fiscal 1997 with strong earnings prospects.  Importantly, results-to-date for the first quarter which ends November 30, suggest that the benefits of our restructuring will be reflected in our financial results.

<P>

"Looking forward, our mobile television production division, which provides on-location services for the nation’s premiere televised entertainment and sports events, will expand its capacity by approximately 20% in fiscal 1997 as we build two new mobile production units, with anticipated completion dates of mid-May and late Summer.  These units, our core studio production facilities and post-production operations serve the industry’s most prominent clients.

<P>

"Finally, the Company’s Windsor New Media division, which designs and produces custom CD-ROM, CD-I, videodisc, networked multimedia presentations and "home pages" for the "world wide web," continues to grow, both in terms of revenues and its customer base and will soon be re-named Unitel Interactive."

<P>

Unitel Video, Inc. is a leading provider of studio and mobile production facilities, and post-production and special effects services to virtually every major entertainment company in the United States.  The Company’s studio division comprises nine production studios in New York City which are used by leading network, cable and syndicated television producers.  The Company’s mobile division, with ten units, provides on-location services for the taping and live telecasting of sports, musical, entertainment and cultural events throughout the United States.  The Company also provides post-production and new media services to producers of theatrical films, television programs and corporations through its New York and Los Angeles-based facilities.

<B>Third Quarter Report July 1996

<P>

To Our Shareholders, Personnel and Friends:

</B>
<P>


United Video Satellite Group today reported record operating income before depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and net income, both before non-recurring charges, for the quarter ended September 30, 1996. Consolidated EBITDA and net income were $21.2 million and $8.9 million, or $0.24 per share, respectively, compared to $13.9 million and $6.9 million, or $0.19 per share, respectively, in 1995, representing a 30% increase in net income (exclusive of non-recurring charges associated with transaction costs, severance and other miscellaneous items during the third quarter of 1996 and with the TCI merger and Prevue Interactive's litigation in the third quarter of 1995).  For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, consolidated EBITDA and net income exclusive of non-recurring charges were $55.9 million and $24.4 million, or $0.66 per share, compared to $37.7 million and $19.1 million, or $0.52 per share, respectively, in 1995. 

<P>

For the three months ended September 30, 1996, consolidated revenues were $117.7 million, an increase of 73% over consolidated revenues of $67.9 million for the same period in 1995. Consolidated EBITDA (after non-recurring charges) for the third quarter of 1996 was $19.2 million compared to $12.8 million for the same period in 1995, an increase of 50%.  Consolidated revenues and EBITDA were both positively impacted by $40.2 million of revenues and $3.6 million of EBITDA in 1996 resulting from the Superstar/Netlink joint venture which was formed as a consolidated subsidiary of UVSG effective April 1, 1996. Consolidated net income (after non-recurring charges) for the third quarter of 1996 was $7.5 million,or $0.20 per share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.14 per share, for the same period in 1995, an increase of 42%.  EBITDA margin for the third quarter of 1996 was 16%, a decrease of 3% from the EBITDA margin reported in the third quarter of 1995.  This decrease was the result of the relative size of the retail home satellite programming business, which has a lower margin, to the other business units as a result of the Superstar/Netlink joint venture.

<P>

For the nine months ended September 30, 1996, consolidated revenues were $306.5 million, an increase of 67% over consolidated revenues of $183.9 million for the same period in 1995.  Consolidated EBITDA (after non-recurring charges) for the first nine months of 1996 was $53.4 million compared to EBITDA of $36.4 million for the same period in 1995, an increase of 47%.  Consolidated revenues and EBITDA were both positively impacted by the Superstar/Netlink joint venture. Revenue growth as a result of Superstar’s revenues from the DBS market, Prevue’s ability to increase national advertising 
revenues and the Company’s acquisition in 1995 of  a controlling interest in SSDS fueled the remainder of the growth. SSDS contributed $17.8 million to the consolidated revenue growth for the nine 
month period.  Consolidated net income (after non-recurring charges) for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was $22.6 million, or $0.61 per share, compared to $17.0 million, or $.47 per share, for the same period in 1995, an increase of 33%.  EBITDA margin for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 was 17%, a decrease of 3% from the EBITDA margin reported for the first nine months of 1995.  

<P>

Our third quarter results have only begun to recognize the anticipated cost savings associated with the Superstar/Netlink joint venture. Fourth quarter numbers will benefit from the Starnet joint venture and the Jones C-band acquisition. We anticipate adding annualized costs of approximately $3 million with the hiring of 50 people from TV Guide On Screen beginning in the fourth quarter. We remain excited about the progress we are making to consolidate our position in the pay per view promotion business and the direct-to-home satellite business.

<blockquote>To Our Shareholders:<P>

Increased patient visits at our growing network of outpatient therapy centers nationwide coupled with the continued seasoning of our clinic base produced record net revenues and operating income in the first quarter, and U.S. Physical Therapy's fourth consecutive profitable quarter.  We are also pleased to inform you that our sales growth between 1991 and 1995 of  3,734% earned the Company the 29th rank in <U>INC'S</U> just published list of <I>America's 100 Fastest Growing Small Public Companies</I>.<P>

Net revenues for the 1996 first quarter increased 34.7% to $7,523,000 from $5,586,000 in the same period of 1995, and 12.3% over net revenues of $6,702,000 in the fourth quarter of 1995.  The increase in net revenues in the first quarter of 1996 compared to the same period in 1995 is due to an increase in patient visits as well as a greater number of clinics in operation.  We are pleased to note that net patient revenues at those clinics open more than one year as of March 31, 1996 grew 21.8% from the first quarter of 1995 to the first quarter of 1996.<P>

Operating income for the 1996 first quarter reached $698,000 from an operating loss of $384,000 (including a loss of $438,000 on the closure of two facilities) in the same period in 1995, and increased 29.5% over operating income of $539,000 for the fourth quarter of 1995.  Net income in the period ended March 31, 1996 was $288,000, or $.08 per share, a significant turnaround compared to a net loss of $641,000, or $.18 per share (including the loss of $438,000 on the closure of facilities) for the same period in 1995.  First quarter 1996 net income was up 59% over net income of $181,000, or $.05 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1995.<P>

Clinic operating costs as percentage of net revenues continued to decline in the 1996 first quarter to 78.2% from 82.5% for the same period in 1995, reflecting a greater number of more seasoned clinics in operation.  Operating costs as a percentage of net revenues at new clinics tend to be higher due to start up losses and because clinic revenues are generally lowest in the first year of operation.   Of the 57  clinics operating at March 31, 1996, 14% were less than a year old and an additional 32% were less than two years old.  For the same period in  1995, there were 49 clinics in operation, of which 37% were less than a year old and an additional 39% were less than two years old.  Based on historical performances of the Company's more seasoned clinics, newer clinics are expected to increase their contribution to clinic operations in future quarters.<P>

Corporate office costs as a percentage of net revenues for the 1996 first quarter declined to 12.6% versus 16.5% for the same period in 1995 and 13.0% for the fourth quarter of 1995.  While the Company plans to open ten to fifteen clinics in 1996, compared to the nine clinics opened in 1995, net revenues and clinic operating profits generated by the increased base of seasoned clinics in operation are expected to more than offset any additional recruitment and development expenses.<P>

U.S. Physical Therapy's partnership strategy continues to be the cornerstone of our growth.  By opening clinics in partnership with experienced therapists nationwide, we have built a strong foundation at a much lower cost than had we acquired clinics.  As a complement to our partnership strategy, we are also exploring strategic acquisition and consolidation opportunities which will allow us to further reduce overhead and achieve economies of scale.  In this regard, in January 1996 we opened McKinney Physical Therapy Associates by consolidating our McKinney, Texas facility into an acquired local facility.<P>

We look forward to reporting to you on the continued progress we expect for the Company this year.  On behalf of the staff of U.S. Physical Therapy and your Board of Directors, we thank you for your continued support.<P> 

Sincerely,</blockquote><P>

<B>December 9, 1996
<P>


Dear Fellow Shareholders:</B>		

<P>

The past six months have been an exciting and productive time at US Servis.  Since there are so many positive things to report, we are initiating a new investor communications program. This letter to our shareholders, discussing the performance of the Company during the first six months of this fiscal year, is the first in a series of communications you will receive to keep you informed of our progress. 
 
<P>

Business and financial results reflect strong demand for outsourcing services provided by the Company.  In May of this year, Christ Hospital, located in Jersey City, NJ, and The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, renewed their contracts. The contracts are valued at approximately $1,000,000 and $3,000,000 per year, respectively.  Since August 1, 1996, US Servis has signed three new, major outsourcing contracts.  The Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City expanded its contract with US Servis to include inpatient billing services, an estimated increase of $1,000,000 in annual revenue. This is the first time US Servis has provided services for hospital inpatients.  As most hospital revenues come from services provided on an inpatient basis, this represents an exciting growth possibility for US Servis. Columbia/HCA HealthOne, a rapidly growing physician network located in Denver, CO, signed a three year contract for business and systems management services. Jersey City Medical Center returned its outpatient billing services to US Servis after a brief arrangement with another vendor.  The initial annual value of the Columbia and Jersey City Medical Center contracts is approximately $1,000,000 each.  Once fully implemented, these three new contracts will result in annual revenue in excess of $3,000,000.

<P>

The Company is experiencing strong revenue growth and operating and financial performance continues to steadily improve.  For the six months ended September 30, 1996, revenues totaled $9,847,000, an increase of $1,931,000 or 24.4% compared to the same period last fiscal year. While aggressively pursuing revenue growth, we continue to carefully manage expenses. As a result, expenses (excluding the gain from restructuring) for the first six months of fiscal 1997 only increased $790,000 or 7.3% over the same period last year. For the six months ended September 30, 1996, the Company’s loss before income taxes and restructuring gain was $1,821,000, a reduction of $1,141,000, or 38.5%, compared to the same period last year.

<P>

An important strength of US Servis is our balance sheet.  At September 30, 1996, the Company had $8,693,000 in cash and cash equivalents, shareholders’ equity in excess of $14,900,000 and only $616,000 of long-term liabilities.  Reflected in these balance sheet statistics is a $4,000,000 investment in US Servis made in September of this year by private investors led by Frontenac Company.  We believe that this investment is a strong endorsement in the future of  the Company.

<P>

I’m very pleased to report that in November of this year, we satisfactorily resolved the issues arising from a very difficult implementation for our largest customer, MetroPlus. This was our first implementation in a Medicaid HMO. We are very appreciative of the support we received from all the MetroPlus and US Servis personnel who worked together to achieve this positive outcome.

<P>

While company management is pleased with the progress achieved to-date, we clearly understand that a great deal remains to be done to realize our two primary goals: return US Servis to profitability and build shareholder value. We are excited about the many opportunities for outsourcing services that exist in our markets, we anticipate continued improvements in operational and financial results, and we look forward to reporting to you on our future progress.  In closing, we appreciate your investment in US Servis and wish you a happy and prosperous New Year.

Dear Shareholder:

<P>

Valley National Bancorp (NYSE:VLY) reported record earnings of $18.4 million for first quarter 1996, reflecting an ll.1 percent increase in net income from $16.5 million for fourth quarter 1995 and a 5.7 percent increase from $17.4 million for first quarter 1995.  Earnings per share for first quarter 1996 increased to $0.49 per share from $0.44 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.46 per share for first quarter of 1995. 

<P>

This has been the best quarterly earnings  for Valley  in its sixty nine year history.  Valley  achieved solid growth in its core earnings while, at the same time, continued  to invest heavily for the future of the  Company.  Successfully integrating recent acquisitions, instituting a state-of-the-art telephone banking center, and extending its auto loan business into Canada has enabled Valley to enter 1996 well  positioned to provide exceptional customer service and build upon the  strong operating results.

<P>

First quarter 1996 results produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.62% compared with 1.55% for first quarter 1995.  The 1996 annualized return on average equity was 18.4%, again placing Valley among the best performing banks in the United States. Valley's efficiency ratio of 41.5% for first quarter 1996 compares favorably to its ratio of 43.2 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 1995, when the American Banker ranked Valley  as the most efficient banking organization among the 100 largest commercial banks in America.

<P>

Valley National Bancorp is the top performing banking company in New Jersey and ranks among the top ten banks in the nation in performance, according to a study published in the April issue of <I>US Banker</I> magazine, which evaluated 100 of America's largest banking companies based upon their 1995 results.
<P>


With a strong capital position, Valley has  the resources to provide a solid foundation to develop strong business relationships and serve the financial needs of our customers in our growing marketplace.  Reflecting Valley's  commitment to enhance our shareholders' investment, the Board of Directors declared a 5 percent stock dividend on April 2, 1996, while announcing the intention to maintain the annual cash dividend rate at $1.00 per share.

<P>

Effective May l, 1996, Mr. Peter Southway, President, will assume the position of Vice Chairman of both the Bank and Holding Company.  This change is the result of Mr. Southway's desire to modify his primary focus after 45 years with Valley.  Mr. Southway will continue his important role in the management of the Bank, overseeing investments and financial reporting of the Bank and remaining a member of the Board of Directors, Executive and Officer Loan Committees.
Gerald H. Lipkin will assume the title of President in addition to his current position as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of both Valley National Bank and Valley National Bancorp.

<BLOCKQUOTE>   <B>Verilink Announces Record Sales and Earnings for Quarter Ended September 30, 1996</B>
<P>


SAN JOSE, Calif., October 15, 1996 -- Verilink Corporation (NASDAQ:VRLK) today reported record sales and earnings for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 1996.
<P>

Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 were $14,676,000, an increase of 54% over sales of $9,505,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 1995.  Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 was $1,448,000, an increase of 213% from the $463,000 reported for the first quarter of fiscal 1996.  Earnings per share were $.10 in the first fiscal quarter of 1997 as compared with $.04 in the related fiscal 1996 quarter.  As a result of the Company’s initial public offering in June 1996, the weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased to 14,350,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 1996 from 10,837,000 for the related fiscal 1996 quarter.
<P>

Leigh S. Belden, president and chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased to report the record financial results achieved during our first fiscal quarter of 1997.  Contributing to our success during the quarter was a significant increase in shipments to Northern Telecom (Nortel) of the Access System 2000, which is used in Nortel’s implementation of a Personal Communications Services (PCS) network for Sprint.  In addition to the increase in business with Nortel, we believe our strong performance reflected increased acceptance of our Access System 2000 product line as a leading integrated network access solution."

<CENTER><B>THIRD QUARTER 1996 REPORT</B><BR>
Period Ended September 30, 1996</CENTER>
<P>


<B>TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:</B>
 Viewlogic reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.18 per share, including a $1.2 million pre-tax, or $0.04 per share, gain on the sale of an investment, for the third quarter ended September 30, 1996.  This compares to $3.3 million, or $0.19 per share, for the same period last year.  Revenues for the third quarter of 1996 were $34.4 million, compared to $33.2 million reported last year in the third quarter.
<P>


For the nine month period ended September 30, 1996, Viewlogic reported net income of $5.8 million, or $0.33 per share, including the $0.04 per share third quarter gain on the sale of an investment. This compares to $5.1 million, or $0.30 per share, reported in the first nine months of 1995.  Year-to-date revenues were $95.7 million in 1996, compared to $88.5 million recorded in the first nine months of last year.
<P>


As we advised earlier in the year, it was our objective to show gradual improvement in our results over the course of the year.  Our third quarter results, a record revenue quarter for Viewlogic, represent another sequential increase in both total revenue and product revenue compared to the second quarter of 1996.
<P>


However, these results were lower than expected, primarily due to a shortfall in sales in Europe and,  to a lesser extent, a delay in the rate of adoption of Windows `95 and Windows NT by EDA users.  Although sales of our ASIC tools and sales in Japan achieved record levels,  the overperformance in these areas was not sufficient to compensate for the impact of the factors mentioned above.
<P>
 

In the fourth quarter, we will focus our attention on strengthening our European management team. The next version of our suite of Windows '95 and Windows NT based tools, Workview Office, is focused on language based design and is scheduled to begin shipping in the fourth quarter of this year.
<P>


We remain committed to our goal of developing innovative, leading edge technologies within the highest quality tools and solutions to help our customers continually address their time to market and product differentiation challenges.
<P>

<CENTER><B>FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 1996 RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>

SEATTLE, October 23, 1996 --- Visio Corporation (NASDAQ: VSIO) today reported results for the fourth quarter and audited results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1996.  Revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 were $16.5 million, a 61 percent increase over fourth quarter fiscal 1995 revenues of $10.3 million.  Net income was $3.8 million and earnings per share were $0.26, compared to net income of $0.9 million and earnings per share of $0.08 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995.  The Company achieved an operating margin of 29 percent, compared to 14 percent for the same period last year.
<P>

Revenues for fiscal 1996 were $59.7 million, a 74 percent increase over fiscal year 1995 revenues of $34.2 million.  Net income for the year was $11.1 million and earnings per share were $0.76, compared to net income of $2.3 million and earnings per share of $0.20 for fiscal 1995.  The Company achieved an operating margin of 24 percent for the year, compared to 9 percent for fiscal 1995. 
 
<P>
"I’m very proud of Visio’s performance in the past fiscal year," said Jeremy Jaech, president and CEO of Visio Corp.  "We have proven we can deliver an expanded product offering and achieve our financial benchmarks.  During fiscal 1996 we  diversified by channel, saw results from our investments in Europe and the Pacific Rim, completed an acquisition, strengthened our balance sheet with our IPO in November and surpassed our internal revenue and operating profit objectives.  Our results to date indicate that the business drawing and diagramming market on the Windows desktop is real, and we are gratified to own the dominant share of this rapidly expanding market."

<P>
During fiscal 1996 Visio Technical generated revenues of $17.7 million which were 30 percent of total revenues.  Visio Technical revenues for the fourth quarter are $6.2 million which represents 38 percent of total revenues.  Volume licensing revenues of $2.2 million increased 144 percent over the prior year’s comparable quarter.  New product introductions during the quarter include Visio 4.0 localized in Dutch, Swedish and Chinese and Visio Technical 4.1 in Kanji for the Japanese market.
<P>

"The drivers to future growth of our business are continued increase in awareness of Visio, further penetration of the Windows market, and the acquisition of new users through vertical solutions developed by Visio and third party partners," said Jaech.  "Our core Visio products help us reach a large, untapped population of users who want or need to create and use drawings electronically.  Visio addresses the diverse needs of the general business user, Visio Technical reaches key verticals in the technical drawing arena, while Visio Professional, scheduled for release late in the December quarter, is allowing us to address the needs of the IS professional."

<P>
Visio Corp., a leading supplier of enterprisewide business diagramming and technical drawing software, was founded in September 1990.  The Seattle-based company pioneered the drawing and diagramming market with the release of Visio 1.0 in November 1992, and has since released additional Windows-based products for the creation and exchange of drawings and diagrams in business.  Visio’s powerful product architecture, combined with partner programs and third-party relationships in key market segments, is establishing Visio as a desktop platform standard for the creation of graphical solutions.  The company markets the Visio product line in more than 26 countries throughout the world.  
<P>

<I>This press release contains forward-looking statements.  There are certain important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made above.  Among these are fluctuations in quarterly performance, dependence on other products including Microsoft Windows, competition in the business drawing and diagramming software market, timing and customer acceptance of new products, and changes in general economic conditions.  Additional information concerning these and other risks is described in the "Risk Factors" section of the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed by the Company on September 15, 1995, and, from time to time, in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission reports, which include the Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1996.  Actual results may differ materially.</I><P>

<a name="letter"><h3>Letter to Shareholders:</h3></a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  Dear Shareholder:
<P>


Late last month we held our annual shareholders meeting in San Diego followed by another meeting to brief shareholders in the Minneapolis area.  I thought it would be appropriate for me to use this report to review the highlights of those meetings and outline our vision of VISTA’s future.

<P>

<B>3Q96 Results</B>.  Operating results for the third quarter followed the positive trend established in the previous six quarters: VISTA is making significant process toward profitable operations.  You will notice in the following financial statements a line labeled EBITDA. This line represents the results of our actual operations, prior to consideration of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  Results for the 3Q96 showed a loss of $48,944 compared with $300,731 during the same period last year.  While our reported net loss is substantially higher than this number, it is important to note that the largest contributing factor in this loss continues to be non-cash amortization charges associated with the valuation write-up that occurred at the time of the acquisition of VISTA Environmental Information.  Our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) results are encouraging, and demonstrate VISTA’s success in reducing expenses, increasing gross margins, and steadily moving toward the profitability that we all expect.

<P>

<B>Environmental Profitability.</B>  The environmental line of our business was operationally profitable for the fifth successive quarter.  This success is largely attributed to our ability to sign clients and prospects to annual STARVIEW license agreements as described in the following paragraph.  

<P>

<B>STARVIEW</B>Strategy.  Late in 1995 we began an intensive effort to convert our core environmental business from a service bureau, 
report based operation to that of a software publisher of information tools.  In the 3Q96 we began to feel the first tangible effects of this strategy through the realization of recurring subscription revenues.  This quarter nearly 20 percent of our revenues resulted from annual subscription agreements, compared to similar income of less than 2 percent in the corresponding period last year.  We expect this percentage to increase in the future.  The STARVIEW strategy, in addition to creating guaranteed revenue streams, also contributes to a 10 percent decrease in VISTA expenses in the 3Q96 compared with 3Q95.  As a result, our gross margins have increased from 62 percent to 77 percent.  

<P>

<B>GUS®.</B>  Year to date revenues from our Geographic Underwriting System are up more than 200 percent, but remain below our expectations and forecasts.  We continue to work with our ISO partners, who have marketing and sales responsibilities for the GUS project, to increase efforts and effectiveness in this key area.  Positive signs, however, remain for GUS.  During the 3Q96, after tests which indicated GUS services could result in 2 percent revenue increases for its homeowner policy line, American States signed a long term services agreement that integrates GUS Public Protection Classification (PPC) assignments into the underwriting process for its entire personal property book of business.  Similar agreements with other insurers continue in various stages of the sales cycle and will, like STARVIEW license fees,  provide a long term base for VISTA revenues.

<P>

Timely communication with you, our shareholders, remains a high priority for the VISTA management team.  This 3Q96 report represents a new and significant step in providing information to you with a minimum delay from the time our 10-QSB is filed with the SEC.  Working with ADP, this format will speed the quarterly results to you, generally within three days of our 10-QSB filing.  From time to time we also intend to provide you with other important information about VISTA operations, and we will be able to do so quickly and cost-effectively as the result of our new arrangement.  I hope that you will find this step a positive one, and one which allows you a greater understanding of VISTA’s on-going performance.

<P>

Thank you for your continued support of VISTA and its vision to be the premier provider of risk information management tools to American business and industry.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:</B>
<P>

	We are pleased to report record revenues and net income for the third quarter ended June 30, 1996.  Revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 1996 were $17.3 million, a 57% increase over the $11.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1995 and a 11% increase over the $15.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 1996.  Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 1996 was $3.8 million or $0.18 per share compared to net income of $762,000 or $0.05 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 1995 and net income of $2.6 million or $0.14 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 1996.
	
<P>
For the nine month period ended June 30, 1996, revenues were $46.9 million, a 52% increase over the $30.8 million recorded in the nine month period ended June 30, 1995.  Net income for the nine month period ended June 30, 1996 was $8.1 million or $0.42 per share compared to $276,000 or $0.02 per share for the nine month period ended June 30, 1995.
	
<P>
This was another very successful quarter.  We again set records for all our financial benchmarks: revenue, operating profit, and net income.  Moreover, we introduced the first of our next generation telecom products based upon our most advanced process technology.
	
<P>
During the quarter, we began sampling our first chip set to address the 10 Gb/s SONET transmission systems market.  This 16:1 multiplexer/demultiplexer chip set is the first fully integrated solution for the next generation of SONET systems.  Since this chip set is manufactured with our standard 0.4mm H-GaAs IV process, it can be incorporated as a megacell into a large ASIC or cell based product to provide significant system savings.  By manufacturing these 10 Gb/s products on a standard process, we will be able to eliminate the need to explore the more expensive and exotic research technologies and supply these products at prices comparable to our current generation of 2.5 Gb/s products.
<P>

Sincerely,</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>VTEL Announces Record Revenues, Return to Profitability <BR>
with First Quarter 1997 Results</B></CENTER>
<P>


<B>Austin, Texas (November 14, 1996) -- VTEL Corp., (NASDAQ:  VTEL)</B> today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 1997 ending October 31, 1996.  The company generated record setting revenues of $28.2 million, increasing 45% above the first quarter of fiscal 1996 revenues of $19.5 million.  The company reported net income of $954,000 or $0.07 per share compared to net income of $132,000 or $0.01 per share in the comparable quarter of fiscal 1996.

<P>

"We are pleased to report the company’s return to profitability in this first fiscal quarter of 1997," said Dick Moeller, chairman of the board, CEO and president.  "VTEL has experienced a challenging period over the last year and we are encouraged with the progress the company has made in returning to profitability this quarter.  The market acceptance of our Enterprise Series of products, particularly the TC2000 and our Leadership Conferencing (LC) systems, are driving the growth in product revenues.  In addition, we are already reaping benefits from the realignment of the company into Customer Business Units (CBU’s) and the adjustment of our fiscal reporting period to end on July 31.  We have improved our competitive positioning in the industry with our Enterprise Series products and the SmartVideoconferencing capabilities that we recently announced further leverage our PC-based heritage.  It is from these strengths that VTEL won a major contract with Nortel this quarter, displacing an entire network of competing products."

<P>

The company reported that 44% of the quarter’s revenue was generated from the Education and Government market while the Healthcare sector contributed 20% of the quarterly revenues.  The service and integration segments contributed close to 26% of total revenues, with the remainder coming from product sales.  VTEL’s reseller distribution channels delivered 96% of the revenues.  International sales strengthened in the current quarter, generating 21% of total revenue.  The company received orders from new customers including, Bristol Regional Medical Center, Frys Electronics, Pine Bluff Arsenal, St. Mary’s College and the Naval School of Health Sciences.  Expansion orders included  State of Kentucky, US Army T-Net, VA Medical Center, Credit Suisse and the Philippine Long Distance Telephone company, among others.  

<P>

Commenting on the financial performance during the quarter, VTEL’s chief financial officer, Rodney S. Bond said, "The change we made to a fiscal reporting period ending July 31 made a significant positive impact on the company’s operating efficiency this quarter.  Although this quarter is a singular data point, we had much improved visibility into the process of converting sales orders into revenue shipments.  Our factory operations were more level-loaded and we avoided the disruption often encountered at the end of a quarter as orders are received that immediately have to be converted into shipments.  Both improved gross profit margins and reduced operating expenses led to reporting profitable operating income for the quarter."

<P>

VTEL Corp., is the global leader in the design and manufacture of Smart Videoconferencing systems.  VTEL and its authorized resellers have installed systems in some of the largest and most recognized organizations in the United States and around the world, including:  Microsoft Corp., Nortel, BMW AG, Baxter Healthcare, VHA, Inc., Deloitte & Touche, Credit Suisse, Texas A&M University, and the U.S. Army T-Net.  VTEL has over 700 healthcare installations worldwide, and has systems installed in 23 statewide educational networks.

<CENTER> <B>WACKENHUT CORRECTIONS <P>

DOUBLES NET INCOME FOR 3RD QUARTER
</B></CENTER>
<P>



Palm Beach Gardens, Florida -- October 24, 1996 -- Wackenhut Corrections Corporation  (NYSE: WHC) today reported third quarter 1996 net income increased 102 percent to $2.4 million, from $1.2 million in the third quarter 1995.  Earnings per share increased to 11 cents from 7 cents a year ago.  Third quarter revenue increased 43 percent to $36.8 million from $25.8 million in the 1995 quarter.

<P>

	Net income for the first nine months of the year was $5.7 million or 26 cents a share compared with $3.2 million or 18  cents a share during the first nine months of the previous year, an increase of 78  percent.  Revenue for the nine months of the year was $99.6 million compared to $71.8 million during the first three quarters of last year, an increase of 39 percent.  All per share data reflect the company’s two-for-one stock split effected on June 4, 1996.

<P>

	Dr. George C. Zoley, president and chief executive officer of Wackenhut Corrections, said, "I am extremely proud of our corporation’s achievements in this third quarter as our financial results once again validate the sustained growth previously projected for our company.  Total revenue-producing beds approached 12,000 beds at the close of the quarter compared to approximately 8,000 beds on January 1, 1996.  This was achieved as the company brought the newly-constructed 1,000-bed state correctional facility in Holly Springs, Mississippi up to full capacity and the 1,000-bed correctional facility in Willacy County, Texas to full operation.  These highly successfully startups have enabled us to continue to leverage our overhead and improve company margins."

<P>

	"Also in the third quarter," Dr. Zoley continued, "we were selected by the state of California for the design, construction and management of three 500-bed state correctional facilities, and our  joint venture company in the United Kingdom was selected by the Home Office for the design, construction, financing and management of a 500-bed correctional facility."

<P>

	Wackenhut Corrections, a world leader in the privatized corrections industry, has contracts/awards to manage 34 facilities in North America, Europe and Australia with a total of 24,282 beds, and additional contracts for prisoner transportation, and for the design, construction and maintenance of secure facilities.

<P>

	The company offers government agencies a turnkey approach to developing new  institutions that includes design, construction and financing.  Its array of services extends to general facility management, security, medical, food, and inmate rehabilitation services for juveniles and adults including basic education, vocational training, chemical dependency treatment and counseling.

<P>

Dear Shareholders:
<P>

It is my pleasure to share with you one of the most significant events in the proud 107-year history of      our company.
On July 22, 1996, Washington Mutual, Inc. announced its intention to acquire through merger Keystone Holdings, Inc. and its American Savings Bank subsidiary of Irvine, California.  The proposed combination would create the 24th largest banking company in the country, serving 1.3 million households, and represents a major expansion for Washington Mutual into the nation’s largest consumer market, California.
<P>


The initial response from the capital markets has been positive.  We believe the transaction will help us create long-term shareholder value because it should immediately add to earnings per share, help reduce interest rate sensitivity and provide a platform for future growth in California.  After the transaction, Washington Mutual will have over $42 billion in assets,          
$23 billion in deposits, and operate 537 banking offices in seven Western states.
<P>

Both Washington Mutual and American Savings Bank are market leaders, focused on providing outstanding products and services to our respective customers.  Both companies are deeply involved in improving the neighborhoods we serve and employees of both companies share a culture that is based on teamwork and commitment to the highest ethical standards in the financial services industry.  In addition, no branch closings or significant layoffs are expected and both companies have outstanding CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) ratings.
<P>

More detailed information about the proposed acquisition through merger will be included in proxy materials mailed to you later this year.  Shareholders of both common and preferred stock will be asked to vote on the transaction.
<P>

If you would like to receive a copy of the July 22 press release announcing the proposed combination, please select one of the following options:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>  <CENTER><B>Waxman Industries, Inc. Reports First Quarter Results<BR>
Strong Operating Performance Reduces Net Loss</B></CENTER>

<P>

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

	Bedford Heights, Ohio -- October 30, 1996 -- Waxman Industries, Inc. (NYSE-WAX), a leading supplier to the U.S. repair and remodeling market, today reported improved results for the Company’s first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 1996.
	
<P>
Net sales increased to $65.9 million, an increase of 14.4% from $57.6 million a year ago.  Loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting improved to $797,000 or $.06 per share from $2.0 million or $.17 per share last year.  Commenting on the quarter’s results, Armond Waxman, President and Co-Chief Executive Officer stated, "The previously announced record quarterly results at Barnett Inc. (Nasdaq:BNTT) combined with strong operating performances at our wholly owned subsidiaries led to a dramatically improved financial performance for our Company as a whole."
<P>

<U>Operating Summary</U><BR>
The net sales increase is primarily attributable to Barnett Inc., which yesterday reported fiscal 1997 first quarter net sales of $36.5 million, an increase of 24.0% from the prior year period.  The increase at Barnett is primarily the result of new product introductions and continued expansion of the telesales operations.  The Company’s wholly owned operations recorded net sales of $29.4 million, an increase of 2.3% from last year.  The increase is primarily the result of additional market opportunities that became available as a result of the Company’s strengthened financial position, increased direct selling activities from the Company’s foreign operations and an improved economic environment for most of the Company’s products.  The increase was partially offset by decreased demand from some of the Company’s larger customers as a result of the highly competitive retail industry.
	
<P>
Comparative quarterly results were also impacted by the April 1996 initial public offering of Barnett (a former wholly owned subsidiary).  The net proceeds of the offering were primarily used to repay indebtedness which, in turn, has significantly reduced interest expense.  The Company continues to consolidate Barnett’s results in its financial statements and first quarter results include a $1.4 million reduction of net income due to the outside stockholders’ interest in the consolidated results of Barnett.  As of October 30, 1996, the Company owns 49.9% of Barnett’s outstanding common stock and, together with non-voting preferred stock of Barnett owned by the Company, approximately a 54% economic interest or 8.46 million shares of the capital stock of Barnett.
	
<P>
The Company recorded a per share loss of $.06 for the quarter versus $.87 last year.  Last year’s loss includes an $8.2 million, or $.70 per share, cumulative charge related to the Company’s decision to change its method of accounting for costs of obtaining long-term business.  The Company is amortizing such costs in the year incurred as opposed to the previous method of amortizing such costs over the period deemed benefited.
<P>

<U>EBITDA and Capitalization</U><BR>
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter totaled $8.0 million versus $6.4 million last year.  EBITDA for the Company’s wholly owned operations totaled $3.0 million versus $2.7 million last year.  Cash interest expense and capital expenditures for the Company’s wholly owned operations totaled $1.8 million and $.5 million, respectively, for the quarter.
	
<P>
The Company’s total debt at September 30, 1996 totaled $129.5 million versus $123.3 million at June 30, 1996.  Approximately $4.0 million of the increase is the result of selected working capital expansion at some of the Company’s wholly owned operations as well as the timing of other working capital requirements during the quarter including cash interest and tax payments.
	
<P>
Waxman Industries, Inc. is a leading supplier to the repair and remodeling market in the United States.  Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Consumer Products, WOC and TWI, and its affiliate, Barnett Inc., the Company markets and distributes a broad range of plumbing, electrical and hardware products to over 55,000 customers in the United States.
	
<P>
Sincerely,

<CENTER><B>Third Quarter Report 1996</B></CENTER>
<B>  To our Shareholders:</B>
<P>

For the third consecutive quarter, Western’s 1996 funds from operations (FFO) has exceeded 1995 results. FFO increased 3% in the third quarter 1996 to $5,598,000, or 33 cents per share, from $5,445,000, or 32 cents per share, for the same period in 1995. We reported net income of $2,794,000, or 16 cents per share, compared to $2,772,000, or 16 cents per share, in 1995.
<P>

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 1996, FFO increased 9% to $16,766,000, or 99 cents per share, from $15,355,000, or 91 cents per share, in 1995. Net income increased 29% to $9,479,000, or 56 cents per share, compared to $7,363,000, or 44 cents per share, in 1995, partially as a result of $1,115,000, or 6 cents per share, in gains on sales in 1996.
<P>

We attribute Western’s improved operating results primarily to the continued strengthening California economy. After several years of very difficult times, it is encouraging to see a stronger economic environment, which should help Western generate improved operating results for its shareholders.
<P>

Reflecting the strengthening California economy, the September 30, 1996, portfolio occupancy averaged 93.9% compared to the September 30, 1995, occupancy of 93.3%.
<P>

Western declared a dividend of 28 cents per share payable to shareholders of record on November 22, 1996. The 131st quarterly dividend will be paid December 15, 1996, continuing our more than 32 years of uninterrupted dividend payments.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER><B>Report to Shareholders for the <BR>Second Quarter Ended June 30, 1996</B></CENTER>

<P>

Dear Shareholders:
<P>

It is a pleasure to submit to you our first report on the performance of our new public company.  In this and future letters we will highlight the key accomplishments and challenges faced by the company.  While we are in one business, that of providing wireless communications services, our operations consist of rural markets in which we provide service using cellular technology and urban markets in which we provide service using Personal Communications Services or PCS technology.  The cellular markets are growing rapidly and generating substantial operating cash flow, while our PCS markets are in a start-up phase and consuming cash.  Our financial statements report consolidated financial results, but in this letter we will describe the results of operations separately.
<P>

<B>Cellular</B><BR>
The quarter ended June 30, 1996 was a strong and important period of growth for our cellular operations.  Marketing under the CellularOne® name, we added 25,700 net new subscribers from internally generated growth during the quarter resulting in ending the quarter with 264,200 subscribers.  This represents 72% increase over the prior year.  Our revenue increased 64% as a result of the larger subscriber base and stability in our average subscriber revenue.  We reduced the cost of serving a customer by approximately 10% during the past year.  Our strong growth required a substantial increase in marketing expenses but we were able to increase cash flow by 133% to $16.5 million during the quarter.  We completed the acquisition of a market in Kansas, bringing the total number of cellular markets served to 73.  During the past 12 months we have added 56 cell sites to substantially increase our regional footprint.
<P>

<B>PCS</B><BR>
In our urban markets where we operate PCS systems under the VoiceStreamSM name, we made significant progress in the construction of  our systems.  On June 29 we turned up the system in Salt Lake City, Utah, on July 15 we turned up our system in Albuquerque, New Mexico and on August 12 we turned up our system in Portland, Oregon.  We are proud that, as of today, of the seven operational PCS systems in the United States, our company has built four of them.  Our subscriber base grew to 6,400 subscribers almost entirely in Hawaii. While still during the start-up phase, we are pleased with the progress and success to date.  During the fourth quarter we anticipate turning up two additional systems and providing additional coverage in markets that are already operational.
<P>

The completion of our public offerings in May provides our company with adequate resources to meet our future commitments.  The auctioning of new licenses by the FCC and tremors in the financial market have created a turbulent environment for new companies entering the wireless business.  We view these challenges to be an opportunity for Western Wireless to continue to grow our business.
We look forward to reporting to you on our progress in the future.

<B>Dear Fellow Shareholder and Friends:</B>


<P>

After 14 months of unfruitful Company initiated discussions with the UMWA Benefit Funds, we have been unable to reach a reasonable settlement of our retiree obligations.  The Company's greatest value is as an ongoing, unified enterprise, with Westmoreland Resources, Inc. ("WRI") and Westmoreland Energy, Inc. ("WEI") at its core, and our tax assets, (currently over $175 million of tax loss carryforwards), available to offset taxes and help generate substantial additional free cash. The Funds only proposal, delivered on December 13, is that we should pay them a lump sum of $110 million cash now, even if it means liquidation of the Company.  Liquidation would only partially pay these benefits, (leaving others to pay the rest, if they can) and yet would destroy a large part of the value of the Company and unfairly impact other interested constituencies.  We challenge the Funds' irresponsible and needless interpretation of the Coal Act, and have filed for protection under Chapter 11 in Colorado in order to protect the Company's value.  We have taken this action to protect your interests as well as the interests of all of our stakeholders.

<P>

<B><U>Background.</U></B>  You will recall that beginning in 1992, the Company initiated a turnaround effort which included discontinuation of unprofitable operations, sale of non-core assets, and elimination of bank debt.  That effort is virtually complete today, and the Company's current coal and energy operations are solid and cash producing.  Westmoreland's value is greatest as a unified ongoing enterprise, partly because of nearly $175 million worth of net operating loss carryforwards, the value of which would be lost if the Company liquidated or sold off its major income producing business units, WRI or WEI.  Our efforts and financial status are well documented.

<P>

<B><U>1992 Coal Act. </U></B>  As we have described to you in many past letters, our 142-year old Company carries the burden of substantial "heritage costs," including guaranteed lifetime, 100% medical benefits for union retirees and their dependents mandated by the 1992 Federal Coal Act.  Under the direction of various UMWA Benefit Funds, the Coal Act requires coal companies who signed any National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement since 1950 to provide lifetime medical benefits to United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) employees who retired before October of 1994 and their dependents.  These obligations are joint and several, creating a "last man's club" among coal producers and their successors.  Our cash payments to the Funds exceed $14 million per year and include support of beneficiaries who never worked for Westmoreland or any of its affiliates, but whose employers have already gone out of business.  The Company faces additional cash liabilities under the Coal Act of approximately $4 million in "catch up" costs for newly assigned additional beneficiaries and $21 million to secure future health benefit obligations, as well as  another $14 million for UMWA Pension Plan withdrawal because of the Company's imminent termination of union operations in Appalachia.  These liabilities total over $200 million on a present value basis, and over $700 million on a pay-as-you-go cash basis.  The Company's other benefit costs include workers compensation expenses of over $5 million per year.

<P>

<B><U>Problem.</U></B>  Although we are trying to support the provision of benefits to Funds' retirees, we are unable to cover fully their enormous annual cash costs along with our other obligations.  Even though the Company has sold assets to generate positive cash flow up until now, such sales cannot continue indefinitely and do not produce enough cash to enable the Company to meet its continued obligations to the Funds for the long term.  Continued asset sales now, combined with a failure of the Funds to reach a timely long-term agreement, would result in the eventual total liquidation of the Company at less than its full value as an ongoing business.  Liquidation of the Company would leave hundreds of millions of dollars of liabilities to be funded by someone else.  It is inevitable, therefore, that some portion of the cost of benefits currently borne by Westmoreland will be transferred to the Funds and in turn, at least for now, to the other coal producers who, like Westmoreland, are jointly and severally liable and by law must contribute to them.

<P>

<B><U>Over One Year of Unfruitful Discussions with the Benefit Funds.</U></B>  Recognizing the Company would not be able to fund the benefit costs and in pursuit of a fair and realistic approach to advantage all concerned, we initiated discussions with the UMWA Benefit Funds in November 1995.  The Funds demanded that Westmoreland continue paying benefits "as the price of admission" for discussions so the Company was forced to continue selling assets in order to pay benefits during this period.  Westmoreland offered several proposals which would provide for contributions in excess of what the Funds would receive in a liquidation.  These proposals included provisions for ongoing contributions.  The Funds failed to accept any of Westmoreland's proposals and offered no counter proposals.  With Westmoreland behind in payments, and with the Company facing ongoing liquidity constraints imposed by continued payment of benefits, its healthcare administrator suspended administration of benefits on November 27, 1996.  Coal Act beneficiaries were then transferred to the Funds where comparable benefits are provided.  The rest of the Company's employees and retirees continue to receive their benefits from the Company.  The Funds' response was to sue Westmoreland to force continued payment.  On December 13, 1996, saying "it is immaterial to the (Benefit Funds') Trustees whether Westmoreland obtains the necessary funds through liquidation or otherwise," the Funds proposed a lump sum payment by Westmoreland of $110 million, their first and only offer after 14 months of discussions.  The Company could not pay anything close to this amount, even if it did liquidate.

<P>

<B><U>Our Position and Commitment. </U></B> We can't pay the full cost of these benefits, but the Company wants to contribute and help assure the beneficiaries are secure now and in the future.  We are trying to serve these retirees, not escape them.  Westmoreland's approach maximizes the Company's value, thereby producing the greatest possible contribution to Benefit Funds' retirees, and protects other stakeholders, including unrelated retirees, coal producers, workers compensation recipients, customers, employees, shareholders and the public.  We believe those who help create that value should benefit as well.  Unless a structured settlement with the Funds can be achieved, much value will be lost.  Assets will be sold at "going out of business" prices.  Jobs will be destroyed, retirees will be hurt, and other obligations will be unfulfilled.  Benefit costs of other coal producers will be needlessly increased.  The public may eventually have to bear costs the industry cannot.  All this may be minimized, if not avoided, by Westmoreland's approach which emphasizes the preservation and creation of value through continued operation rather than its destruction through liquidation.

<P>

We will not voluntarily allow liquidation of the Company, especially at a great loss of value, only to partially fund certain UMWA retiree obligations and at the expense of our other statutory obligations and our responsibility to beneficiaries, employees, customers, suppliers, partners, you, our shareholders, our industry, and the public.  Accordingly, since the Funds continue to demand payment beyond our financial capacity and choose to ignore our proposals for a reasonable structured settlement, the Company has taken legal action to protect the value of the Company.
<P>

We cannot promise the outcome of such court proceedings, however, we have a strong team in place which is prepared to fight for your interests, as well as the interests of our other stakeholders.

<P>
Thank you for your continued support.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Fellow Shareowner:

<P>

 Reflecting overall softness in the semiconductor market, Wyle Electronics reported lower third quarter earnings compared to the prior year.  Operating results for the first nine months  exceed those for the same period last year.
<P>

For the third quarter ended September 30, 1996, net         income totaled $8.6 million, or $0.67 per share, down 15% compared to net income of $10.1 million, or $0.80 per share, in last year’s third quarter.  Sales increased 8% to $295 mil-lion from $273 million reported in the third quarter of 1995.
<P>

Net income for the first nine months of 1996 was $30.7 million, or $2.38 per share, an increase of 20% compared to net income of $25.6 million, or $2.03 per share, for the year ago period.  Sales for the first nine months of 1996 were $929 million, up 19% from the $778 million reported for the first three quarters of 1995. 
<P>
 
As we anticipated in an announcement made in early September, the challenging semiconductor market          environment that our industry began experiencing in this year’s second quarter negatively impacted Wyle’s third quarter   operating results.  During the quarter, the overall semi-conductor market continued to be affected by customers reducing excess inventory levels in light of shorter product lead times.
While our overall sales of semiconductor products were down from last year’s third quarter, shipments of large scale programmable logic and gate arrays (ASICs) remained a source of strength and were considerably ahead of the same period last year.  In addition, sales in our computer segment continued at a robust pace, led by Digital’s Alpha-based       systems and Quantum’s mass storage products, growing by 50% as compared to last year’s third quarter.  Wyle’s Systems Enhancement Center strongly supported this sales volume, meeting customer demands for systems integration services and achieving record shipments.
<P>

In August we announced the formation of Accord         Contract Services, our value-added services joint venture with Marshall Industries.  The new entity is designed to provide industry leading material management solutions such as       kitting and autoreplenishment systems.  Accord Contract    Services should significantly increase our productivity and   efficiency in providing value-added services.
We were also pleased to announce that Actel and LSI Logic have selected Wyle Ginsbury to market their lines of high-complexity ASIC products in Europe.  These          engagements reflect our strategy to extend the technical competency that Wyle Ginsbury possesses to our European customers.  In support of these commitments, we are opening an ASIC design and programming center in the U.K. and an ASIC design center in Germany.
<P>

Earlier this month, the company learned that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Philips Semiconductors have opted to end their long association with Wyle.  Shipments of AMD product represented about 5% of our total sales, while Philips was running at approximately 2% of Wyle’s sales.  We were disappointed in these actions, since, in the case of AMD, we had gained market share within AMD’s distributor network for the last six out of seven years.  We have the opportunity to recover a significant portion of these sales from comparable products offered by our existing suppliers, along with the ramping up of our new National Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor franchises, announced early in the third      quarter.
<P>

The company continues to focus intently on asset         management and was successful in reducing inventory levels by $26 million during the third quarter.  This inventory reduction provided positive cash flow which contributed to the company’s improved debt leverage ratios for the quarter.
<P>

It’s been a difficult quarter for the industry, yet one of significance for Wyle.  We believe the addition of the National Semiconductor and Fairchild product lines, our expansion program in Europe and the Accord Contract Services joint venture are all positive additions to our prospects for future growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>

To Our Shareholders:
<P>


XATA Corporation reported its results for the fiscal third quarter ending June 30, 1996 on August 6, 1996.  The quarterly earnings announcement distributed to the financial community and business media follows for your information.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>XATA CORPORATION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS</B></CENTER>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 6—XATA Corporation (Nasdaq/NMS:  XATA), a producer of onboard information systems for the fleet trucking industry, today reported net sales for the fiscal 1996 third quarter ended June 30, 1996, of $2,436,236, a 24 percent increase from $1,962,967 in the comparable fiscal 1995 period.  Net income for the fiscal 1996 third quarter rose 45 percent to $332,509 from $230,071 in the comparable year ago period.  Net income per share for the third quarter totaled $.07 compared to $.07 in the fiscal 1995 third quarter.
	
<P>
For the nine months ended June 30, 1996, XATA reported net sales of $7,154,922, up 42 percent from $5,047,699 in the first nine months of the prior fiscal year.  Net income for the 1996 nine-month period totaled $983,360, up 82 percent from $540,678 in the comparable year-ago period.  Net income per share for the 1996 nine-month period totaled $.23 up from $.16 per share in the comparable 1995 period.
	
<P>
Per share figures for the fiscal 1995 and 1996 quarters and year-to-date periods reflect the effects of a 1-for-3 reverse stock split effective September 8, 1995.
	
<P>
Dennis R. Johnson, XATA Corporation president and chief executive officer, attributed the growth in third quarter sales to continued strong acceptance for the XATA system among leaders in the fleet trucking industry.  "The sales growth in the quarter is primarily the result of new accounts won during the period and reflects the benefits of the expansion in our sales coverage, as well as the proven capabilities of our products," said Johnson.  "Among the quarter’s new customers are such leading fleet managers and operators as Penske K-Mart, Golden State Foods, JP Foodservice, Westco and USA Cartage," said Johnson.
	
<P>
Johnson said the growth in net income for the third quarter and year to date results from the company’s continuing emphasis on controlled, profitable growth.  "Our focus remains on steadily improving year-over-year profitability while also making the investments required to support further growth," said Johnson.  He noted that the company delivered a 45 percent increase in third quarter net income over the prior year despite increased spending on sales and marketing during the quarter, which is a period of peak trade show activity in the fleet trucking industry.  In addition, the company increased its spending on customer service operations to support growth in its customer base and increased product development spending to continue enhancing the capabilities of the XATA system.
	
<P>
During the third quarter, the company reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Payne & Associates from United Communications Group in a cash purchase.  Payne & Associates is a software and Internet development company that specializes in products that integrate information and communications technologies for trucking industry applications.  Johnson said XATA expects to complete the acquisition of Payne & Associates during August.  "This acquisition will speed our ability to offer customers unique communications and database applications.  We expect Payne’s customers to be excellent prospects for the XATA system, while XATA’s customers, in turn,  represent a strong opportunity for additional sales of Payne’s products," said Johnson.
	
<P>
<I>This announcement contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements are based on current expectations.  Actual results may differ materially.  These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the "Risk Factors" identified in the company’s prospectus dated December 20, 1995 and other readily available documents.
	</I>
<P>
XATA Corporation develops, markets and services fully integrated mobile information systems for the fleet trucking segment of the transportation industry.  XATA’s systems include proprietary software, onboard touch-screen computers and related hardware components and accessories.

To Our Stockholders:
<P>


The performance of our company for the first six months of 1996 was very good and compared favorably to very strong performance for the first six months of 1995.

<P>

Sales for the six months ended June 30, 1996, increased 15.3% to $1,589.8 million as compared to $1,379.3 million for the same period last year.  Income from operations for the six months of 1996 was $124.1 million as compared to $110.4 million for the first six months of 1995, an increase of 12.4%.  Net income for the first six months increased 28.5% to $69.8 million, or $1.60 per share, as compared to $54.3 million, or $1.41 per share, for the first six months of 1995.

<P>

Our company grew in each of our three product groups; commercial, residential, and refrigeration, 15%, 13% and 21% respectively.  This strong growth was driven by our increased international presence.  International revenue increased 21% in the first six months, while domestic revenue increased 11%.  In addition, strong demand in the marketplace, new product introductions and increased market penetration contributed to our record sales.

<P>

Continuous improvement in people, products and processes is the cornerstone of our success in the future.  We are realizing the benefits of our cost reduction programs in many of our manufacturing and administrative operations.  Our focus on profitability pays off.  We continue to invest in our future to expand our leadership position and provide superior returns to our stockholders.

<P>

We implemented an Investor Services Program in March.  The Investor Services Program is a comprehensive package of investor services and a convenient low-cost alternative to traditional methods of purchasing, holding and selling shares of stock.  Program participants can automatically reinvest dividends in York common stock and may also add cash for the purchase of additional shares.  For more information on this program, please call Chase Mellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. at 800-437-6726.

<P>

We are enthusiastic about our business prospects and look forward to reporting our progress to you.  Thank you for your continued support.

<B>LETTER TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:  </B>
<P>
During the third quarter, we saw continued strong demand for our Dolby AC-3 audio decoder chip for usage in Digital Video Disc (DVD) applications.  Our family of audio decoder devices is the world’s first Dolby certified AC-3 decoder that is in volume production.
	
<P>
As a result, total revenues for the third quarter were $10.4 million, up 83%  from $5.7 million in the comparable quarter last year. Product sales for the quarter rose 89% to $10.1 million, compared to $5.3 million in the third quarter last year. For the quarter, we reported  net income of  $1.1 million, or $0.14  per share.  This compares to $226,000, or $0.03 per share for the same period last year.
	
<P>
Product gross margin for the third quarter was 44.7%, compared to 51.0% in the third quarter last year and 39.3% last quarter.  Product sales for the current quarter reflected revenue from an advance payment that had been deferred in prior periods and recognized in the third quarter upon completion of a multi-year sales program with a strategic partner.  Without the benefit of this revenue, product gross margin for the third quarter of 1996 would have been approximately the same as the second quarter.  Product gross margin is dependent on product mix and the percentage of products sold directly to Zoran’s OEM customers versus indirectly through our marketing partners, who absorb most of the associated marketing and sales costs.   Near-term, we believe that the proportion of our product sales represented by relatively lower priced Dolby AC-3 products sold indirectly to manufacturers through our distributor in Japan will continue to be high, placing pressure on margins.  
	
<P>
Research and development spending increased 44% in the quarter however decreased as a percentage of total revenues.  Selling, general and administrative expenses also decreased as a percentage of total revenues, primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses necessary to support increased sales levels, increased royalties related to higher sales and increased administrative expenses associated with being a publicly-traded company.  
	
<P>
Although sales of Dolby AC-3 products were up substantially from prior periods there have been delays in the development of the DVD market, and there still is uncertainty regarding the timing of volume production and shipment of DVD players.  Most of the market uncertainty is related to content copyright issues.  However, it is our understanding that these issues have been recently resolved.  Due to our leading-edge technology as evidenced by Toshiba’s selection of our AC-3 compression technology for use in their new DVD chip set and by selection of our JPEG compression chip set for Apple’s new Macintosh Performa 6400, we believe that we are well positioned to address these new DVD and video editing markets as they emerge.
	
<P>
In an effort to leverage our core technologies and further enhance our market leadership, we recently announced that Zoran has entered into an agreement to acquire CompCore Multimedia, Inc., a provider of MPEG-l and MPEG-2 video and audio compression technology.  CompCore is one of the largest providers of MPEG I playback software for PCs.
	
<P>
We are very excited about this acquisition because CompCore’s engineering talent and designs highly complement our current audio and video compression capabilities.  We also hope to expand our customer base to include a number of CompCore’s major customers, including Cirrus Logic, Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Oracle, Packard Bell, Panasonic and Silicon Graphics.  As a result of the acquisition, we will also have a research and development group located in our headquarters in Santa Clara.  The acquisition, which is subject to shareholder approval, should be completed in the first quarter of 1997.
	
<P>
Forward-Looking Statements  To the extent that any of the statements contained herein relating to the company’s products and markets are forward-looking, such statements are based on current expectations that involve a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, including risks associated with: the integration of CompCore’s operations, technologies and products and the related diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; the rapidly evolving markets for the company’s products and uncertainty regarding the development of these markets; the company’s reliance on independent foundries and contractors for its wafer supplies and product assembly; new product development, the ongoing introduction of new and enhanced products and the transition from older products; intensive competition in the markets in which the company competes; the company’s historic dependence on sales to a limited number of large customers and fluctuations in customer mix and product mix among those customers; the dependence on key company personnel; and the reliance on international sales and operations, particularly on the company’s operations in Israel.  For additional information regarding these and other risks, reference is made to the company’s Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1995 and the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.

<B>SHAREOWNERS GET THE NEWS</B> faster with the latest innovation from ADP.  Now you can reduce the steps to communicate with your shareowners to one: a <FONT color=ff0000><B>3.5 inch computer disk</B></FONT>.  It's this simple:  you enter earnings releases, corporate announcements and other communications on a disk and send or transmit the information to ADP.  We transform it into <I><B>StreetLink</B></I>, a printed self-mailer, addressed to both registered and street-name shareowners.  It's in the mail within 72 hours.  <FONT COLOR=0000ff><B>Guaranteed</B></FONT>.

<P>

<B>INFORMATION MOVES FASTER WITH THE ADP</B> innovation that combines the information value of a traditional printed piece with the production speed and cost-effectiveness of <I><B>StreetLink</B></I>.  <I><B>StreetLink</B></I> is fast and efficient.  It saves you time and money you can use to communicate with shareowners more often, while holding down your publications budget.  <I><B>StreetLink</B></I> is <FONT COLOR=00bb00><B>easy to use</B></FONT>.  At the start, ADP works with you to create custom communications in a simple, reliable format.  You can include not just text, but charts, graphics, signatures.  <I><B>StreetLink</B></I> is flexible.  If you need more space, one insert can be included.  It's the ideal vehicle for any time-sensitive communications, from earnings and press releases to personalized letters and newsletters.  <FONT COLOR=ff0000><B>And because the news is fresher, it's news that matters</B></FONT>. 

<P>

<B>AS YOU SAVE TIME AND MONEY ON</B> communications, you can speak to shareowners more often while controlling (or reducing) your publications budget.  With <I><B>StreetLink</B></I>, ADP shows you how to provide the input we'll use to produce a one-page self-mailing document, printed on an 8.5 by 14 inch self-mailer.  We'll produce graphs and charts, and scan your company logo and executive signatures.  

<P>

You provide the text to ADP on diskette or via PC-to-PC transmission, including charts and financial statistics.  <FONT COLOR=ff0000><B>We go to work at once</B></FONT>.  You can include one insert--reply cards of purchase incentives, for example--and choose first-class or bulk mail.  Either way, we'll have it printed and in the mail to your shareowners, employees, retirees or any other constituency <FONT COLOR=00bb00><B>within 72 hours</B></FONT> of your final approval.  <FONT COLOR=ff0000><B>Guaranteed</B></FONT>.

<P>

<B>YOU'LL FIND STREETLINK THE INNOVATIVE</B> solution to two nagging problems in shareowner communications today:  timeliness and cost.  When traditional mailings arrive, the news is typically more than six weeks old.  <I><B>StreetLink</B></I> arrives when the news is still news.  And travels at a cost few traditional mailing systems can match.

<P>

You'll find ADP Investor Communication Services a partner you can rely on.  We distribute more than 250 million pieces of communications to shareowners every year, with a dedication to perfection that makes <FONT COLOR=00bb00><B>none more important than yours</B></FONT>. 

<P>

To communicate with your shareowners faster and at lower cost--as you stretch your publications budget--consider the <I><B>StreetLink</B></I> alternative.  <FONT COLOR=0000ff><B>Call 1-800-669-4213</B></FONT> now and we'll send you a demo disk detailing <I><B>StreetLink</B></I> and how it can work for you.

To Our Shareholders:

<P>

We are pleased to report record revenue and earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.  This represents ADP's 141st consecutive quarter of record highs in both revenue and earnings per share.
  
<P>
  Revenue was $911 million in the quarter, up 22% from last year.  Revenue growth in our core businesses, Employer, Brokerage, Dealer and Claims Services, was 23%, 12%, 21% and 21% respectively.  Pretax earnings increased 19% and net earnings increased 14% on a higher effective tax rate.  Earnings per share increased 14% to $.32 from $.28 last year.
    
<P>
We completed three very important strategic acquisitions during the quarter.  With the acquisition of Staff Management Systems we were able to enter the fast growing employee leasing market; Health Benefits America enables us to broaden our position in the large benefits outsourcing market; and the acquisition of JDC gives us a clear number one market position as the leading provider of auto dealer services in Europe.
    
<P>
 We are pleased with our results and our outlook.  While we anticipate revenue growth will slow in the second half of the year as we pass the anniversary date of last year's GSI acquisition, we expect consolidated margins to improve.  For the full fiscal year we continue to expect double-digit revenue growth and about 15% growth in earnings per share.
  
<P>
   We hope you are pleased with our results, and thank you for your support.

<H3>Letter to Shareholders</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In fiscal '95, ADP achieved its forty-sixth consecutive growth year in revenue and earnings.  Our 17% growth in both revenue and earnings per share was our best in many years.

<P>

Our success was the direct result of:

<UL>
<LI>very strong leadership positions in each of our businesses;
<LI>accelerated growth in Employer and Dealer Services from increased market penetration, an expanded product array, improved client retention, and several small but strategic acquisitions: and
<LI>productivity gains from automation.
</UL>

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Financial Review</H3>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Net earnings grew 18% to approximately $395 million on $2,894 million of revenue.  Earnings per share increased to $2.77 as we completed our 136th consecutive quarter of "double-digit" growth in earnings per share.

<P>

In recognition of these strong operating results, our Board declared its twenty-first consecutive annual dividend increase, from $.60 to $.70 per share, effective July 1, 1995.

<P>

ADP continues to operate from a position of significant financial strength and liquidity.  Cash flow from operations exceeded $478 million and year-end cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated $1.3 billion after spending $121 million to acquire businesses and shares.  We purchased 219,000 ADP shares on the open market to partially service employee equity plans.

<P>

Our shareholders' equity now exceeds $2 billion.  Debt-to-equity is comfortable.  19 to 1 and return on average shareholders' equity continues to be a very healthy 21%.

<P>

Capital expenditures for the year were $118 million compared to $111 million last year.

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Strategies</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
ADP's growth strategies continue to focus primarily on expanding the leadership positions of our core businesses, where we have lots of remaining opportunities.  Our major priorities are:

<UL>
<LI>deliver superior client service to enhance value and increase client retention;
<LI>increase market penetration by broadening product lines and expanding distribution channels;
<LI>provide ancillary products and services that create incremental value for existing clients;
<LI>expand existing businesses internationally:  and 
<LI>enter new markets which complement and leverage our core competencies and businesses.
</UL>

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>New Products</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In fiscal '95 we substantially increased investments in new product initiatives.  Systems and programming expenditures increased by 20% last year.  For many years we have increased those developmental expenditures faster than revenue, in order to assure an adequate flow of new offerings.

<P>

<B>Our new products include the following:</B>

<UL>
<LI>Total Time is Employer Services new automated time and attendance system.  It seamlessly integrates client time clocks directly ADP's payroll computers in 39 centers.  Over 1,600 clients now use Total Time to eliminate clerical processes, costs and errors by electronically entering attendance data into a payroll system.
<LI>Brokerage Services introduced Power Partner, the state-of-the-art "object linking and embedding" (OLE) technology for broker's workstations.  It enables clients to more easily build applications and to seamlessly integrate separate data and applications.
<LI>Dealer Services introduced a Document Storage and Data Archiving product that creates a paperless business office for auto dealerships.  This product uses optical scanning and disk technologies to electronically store and retrieve orders, invoices, checks and other documents.
<LI>Claims Services introduced Pen Pro, the first pen-based, mobile, auto claims estimating system.  It's CD-ROM also compresses 1.1 billion bytes onto a single disk for easy portability and access.
</UL>

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Client Services</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
ADP's primary success criterion is outstanding client service.  We are committed to continual service improvement.  Last year, we automated more functions, including a new AutoPay Document Storage.  It offers large clients a paperless CD-ROM alternative to large volumes of paper-saving paper, space, time, shipping costs and clerical labor.  We also made major investments in laptops for all field associates to improve client service quality.

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Acquisitions</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We continue to supplement internal growth through selective strategic acquisitions.  These acquisitions typically expand our client base, add new products or present a new market opportunity.  In fiscal '95, we completed several acquisitions.

<P>

Employer Services enhanced its benefits services capabilities by acquiring WTR, a leading benefits consulting and actuarial firm.  Brokerage Services strengthened its international presence and capabilities by acquiring Wilco International which provides global multi-currency clearance and settlement services for international securities.  Brokerage also enhanced its institutional presence by acquiring Shark Information Services which provides real-time market information and sophisticated analytics to 5,000 institutional users.  Dealer Services continued its global expansion by acquiring Turbodata's 3,000 auto dealer clients in Benelux, France and Germany.

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Board and Executive Appointments</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In January 1995, George H. Heilmeier, president and chief executive officer of Bellcore (Bell Communications Research), was elected a director.  Dr. Heilmeier also serves on a number of corporate and technology advisory boards.  He has also received numerous awards for his many contributions to the advancements of electronics and computer technology.  After 22 years of valuable service, Edwin D. Etherington has decided not to stand for reelection in November.

<P>

Mike Martone, Tim Lamb, Michael Holmes, John Hogan, Dante Terzo and Harry Durity were named Corporate Vice President in recognition of their important contributions and responsibilities.

<P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Outlook</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
ADP will continue to grow by providing new products and outstanding service to clients, while making selective acquisitions that expand market share or present new opportunities.  We expect to achieve revenue and earnings per share growth of about 15% in fiscal '96.

<P>

The most critical element in our continued growth is our team of 25,000 associates who make ADP's client service unique.  We have been fortunate in attracting and retaining exceptionally motivated, talented people who share our vision of high quality service.  We thank our ADP team, and we are particularly pleased that 15,000 associates are also ADP shareholders.

<B>Second Quarter Fiscal 1996 and Year-To-Date
<P>
 Results and Business Outlook </B>

For the three months ended April 30, 1996, The Cooper Companies, Inc. reported net income of $2.8 million, or 24 cents per share, compared to $605 thousand, or 5 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1995. Income from operations increased 168% to $4.1 million from $1.5 million in last year’s second quarter. Revenue increased 13% with strong gains at CooperVision, the contact lens business, and CooperSurgical, the gynecology products group. Revenue at Hospital Group of America (HGA), the psychiatric services business, was flat versus last year’s second quarter. For the first half of fiscal 1996, net income was $3.5 million, or 30 cents per share, compared to $880 thousand or 8 cents per share in the same period a year ago.  Revenue for the 6 months grew 4% to $49 million.

<P>

CooperVision’s sales grew 21% to $12.2 million in the quarter and have increased 15% to $22.2 million year to date. Toric lens sales increased  43% for the quarter and have increased 34% year to date and now comprise over half of the division’s sales. CooperVision believes that it is the second leading and fastest growing supplier of toric lenses in the United States.

<P>

CooperVision’s success relates to its expanding presence in the fast growing "planned replacement" segment of the domestic toric lens market, where patients replace their lenses monthly or quarterly based on comfort and clinical success. CooperVision has nearly  tripled its business in this segment during the first six months of the fiscal year. During the second quarter, CooperVision introduced a second lens size and can now offer more than three times the number of combinations to correct astigmatism than competitive manufacturers.

<P>

CooperSurgical’s sales during the quarter were $3.6 million, up 28% and year to date have increased 15% to $7.1 million. In mid-April, CooperSurgical completed the acquisition of Unimar, Inc., a leading manufacturer of specialty gynecology products and announced an agreement to market several unique, disposable vaporization electrodes for gynecological surgery. In May, CooperSurgical introduced two new products with competitive advantages: the PRIMA™ Series Speculum for gynecological surgery and the Carter retractor for use in infertility procedures. Approximately 90% of CooperSurgical’s sales are now to the gynecology market.

<P>

HGA reported second quarter revenue of $11 million compared to $10.9 million in the second quarter of 1995. If revenue from a hospital management contract that expired in May of 1995 is eliminated, HGA revenue grew 5% as the business achieved several important milestones: Hampton Hospital reported the highest level of admissions in the last two years and returned to profitability two months after its medical staff transition in the first quarter; MeadowWood Hospital achieved record levels of inpatient admissions, outpatient and partial treatment patients in each month of the quarter and Hartgrove Hospital recorded all time high outpatient and partial patient volume. Consistent with its strategy of providing a cost-effective continuum of care for its patients and to strengthen its competitive position, HGA plans to open two residential treatment centers during the next 12 months.

<P>

Year-to-date, HGA’s revenue declined 8% to $19.7 million. Compared without the hospital management contract, revenue declined 4% as poor weather and reduced patient volume during the Hampton medical staff realignment combined to moderate results.

<P>

In view of its excellent operating results and the anticipated 20 cents per share deferred tax benefit, the Company is increasing its earnings per share estimate for fiscal 1996 to a range of $1.00 to $1.10. The tax benefit results from the anticipated recording of a like amount of net deferred tax assets reflecting an anticipated reduction of a valuation allowance which, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, has precluded the Company from carrying as an asset on its balance sheet the potential  tax benefit attributable to any of its $240 million net operating loss carryforward. The Company anticipates that, at the end of fiscal 1996, it will be able to recognize a portion of this asset, assuming it achieves its current projection for earnings before taxes. 

<P>

All of the above statements that refer to the Company’s estimated  or anticipated future results are forward-looking. As these statements are based on the Company’s current expectations, they contain risk and uncertainty. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially. Factors that could cause or contribute to material differences are set forth in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the three months ended January 31, 1996.
