The London Transport Museum moved in 1980 to the listed Grade 2 cast-iron framed, glass-roofed Victorian Flower Market in the south-east corner of the Covent Garden Piazza.  Its unique collection tells the story of London's public transport and of the effect this has had for nearly 200 years on the growth of London and on the lives of Londoners.
<p>
<p>In December 1993, the Museum reopened after a nine-month, 4 million, redevelopment designed to make it one of the most imaginatively interpreted museums in the country and involving the installation of new floors and a high-level glass and steel bridge.  The redisplay now does full justice to the gleaming buses, trams and trains, and allows the famous poster collection to be shown in conditions which take account of their delicate condition.  Since the reopening, there has been a 50% increase in the number of admissions.
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../keyex_s.gif" ALT="Key Exhibits" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="22">
<BR>
The focus at the Museum is on the major developments in travel in London and in London's transport history.  The displays explore topics ranging from the evolution of the bus, the travelling needs of London's workforce and how the expansion of the public transport network interacted with the growth of London.
<p>
<p>In the streets of 19th century London, the horse reigned supreme.  On display are a replica of London's first horse-drawn omnibus of 1829 and a horse tram of the 1880s.  The introduction of the motor bus marked a major step forward.  On show is one of the first successful mass-produced motor buses in the world, the B-type of 1910, and an example of the famous RT-type bus, designed in 1938 and continuing in regular passenger service until 1979.
<p>
<p>London's much-loved electric trams are represented by three vehicles, the 1910 West Ham tramcar, the standard E1 tram and  the luxurious Feltham car of 1931.
<p>
<p>London's (and the world's) first underground railways relied on steam locomotives.  Displayed at mezzanine level is Metropolitan Railway locomotive number 23, built in 1866, which provided motive power for trains on the Metropolitan and the Circle Lines for 40 years.  Alongside stands the electric locomotive, "John Hampden", which hauled trains on the Metropolitan's trunk route into the countryside to the north west of London.

<p>
<p>London Transport's renowned design heritage is also explored at the Museum, with displays on corporate design, graphics, vehicle design and architecture.  The Pick Gallery regularly features exhibitions of posters from the Museum's superb collection, while the Beck Gallery tells the story of the famous map of the London Underground.  This highly-stylised map was designed in the 1930s by a young draughtsman, Harry Beck, who represented each of the lines vertically, horizontally and diagonally.  Rejected at first for being too revolutionary, Beck's map was eventually adopted and developed.  This design "classic" has been copied by metro systems all over the world and has become an icon of London itself.
<p>
<p>
<p><IMG SRC="../museu_s.gif" ALT="The Museum at Work" WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="22">
<BR>Interpretation
<BR>
<p>Clear and accessible display panels allow visitors to delve as deeply as they wish into London's transport history.  The latest high-tech interactive displays and multi-lingual touch-screen facilities allow visitors to explore film and photograph archive material.  Two video wall displays tell the story of London's expansion as transport technology developed, and of the people who made the system work.
<p>
<p>Young visitors are encouraged to get into the driving seat of a bus or a tube train, and to try out the simulators.  Actors playing a wide range of characters from London's transport history bring the vehicles and displays to life.  There are guided tours of the Museum and its collection at weekends, regular lectures, workshops and conferences, and holiday time trails, activities and events designed specially for families.
<p>
<p>
<p>Special exhibitions
<BR>
<p>The two new exhibition galleries, with regularly changing special displays, have been built with high standards of environmental control to allow a much greater range of material to be displayed than previously.
<p>
<p>
<p>Education
<BR>
<p>The Museum is a popular place for educational visits, with over 800 school groups being accommodated each year.  The Museum's Education Service offers a pack containing National Curriculum materials and a range of other resources to support work both at the Museum and in school.  The Education Service also co-ordinates a programme of workshops and activities, and has recently produced a special video to enable schools to prepare for a visit to the Museum.
<p>

<p>London Transport's Education Liaison Officer is also based at the LT Museum and can supply a range of resources, some of which are linked into the National Curriculum, on London Transport, London Underground and London Tramsport Buses.  Behind the scenes schools visits to London Underground and to some of the bus companies which run services on LT's behalf can also be arranged.
<p>
<p>Information and Research facilities
<p>
<p>The Museum houses an Information Centre for visitors who wish to obtain more detailed information on the collections.  Research facilities are also available in the Museum's Reference Library where, by appointment, users can study a wide range of printed material on transport topics, as well as visual records consisting of photographs, slides and posters.
<p>
<p>Commercial Activity
<p>
<p>Responsible for managing and exploiting London Transports copyright assets, the LT Museum has a commercial department which controls and licenses world-wide use of the famous London Transport circle and bar roundel, the Underground map and poster reproductions.
<p>
<p>The Museum Shop
<p>
<p>This popular shop is one of the most successful museum retail outlets in the country.  It offers a wide range of books, souvenirs and gifts, including poster and postcard reproductions of many of London Transport's famous poster commissions dating back to 1908.  A mail order service is also available.
<p>
<p>Corporate Hospitality
<p>
<p>The London Transport Museum is available for corporate hire, and up to 400 guests can be accommodated at evening functions at this attractive and unusual venue.
<p>
<p>Caf
<p>
<p>The Transport Caf, dramatically overlooking the famous Covent Garden Piazza, offers drinks and light refreshments.

<P>All the schemes are tailored to meet your individual and management development needs, leading to professional/chartered status and are designed to help you build a successful career.

<P>The schemes, commencing in September 1997, are in the following areas:

<TR><TD><BR><P>We are looking for motivated, ambitious graduates from all disciplines, although some schemes do have specific requirements.  You should be commercially aware and have the ability to handle both large and small projects simultaneously.  You need to share our vision of an integrated, modern transport system for London and the chance to do something really useful for the community in which you live.

<P>In addition to a competitive salary, benefits include generous travel concessions and an excellent pension scheme.

<P>Brochures and application packs are available from your careers advisory service or you can call our <BR><B>24 hour Graduate Enquiry Line</B> on 0171 918 2035 <BR>if you would like a brochure and pack to be sent to you.

<P>The closing date for receipt of applications is:<BR>

<P><B>Working Towards Equality</B>
<BR>London Transport is striving towards being an equal opportunities employer and welcomes applications regardless of ethnic origin or gender.

The London Transport Museum moved in 1980 to the listed Grade 2 cast-iron framed, glass-roofed Victorian Flower Market in the south-east corner of the Covent Garden Piazza.  Its unique collection tells the story of London's public transport and of the effect this has had for nearly 200 years on the growth of London and on the lives of Londoners.
<p>
<p>In December 1993, the Museum reopened after a nine-month, 4 million, redevelopment designed to make it one of the most imaginatively interpreted museums in the country and involving the installation of new floors and a high-level glass and steel bridge.  The redisplay now does full justice to the gleaming buses, trams and trains, and allows the famous poster collection to be shown in conditions which take account of their delicate condition.  Since the reopening, there has been a 50% increase in the number of admissions.
<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../keyex_s.gif" ALT="Key Exhibits" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="22">
<BR>
The focus at the Museum is on the major developments in travel in London and in London's transport history.  The displays explore topics ranging from the evolution of the bus, the travelling needs of London's workforce and how the expansion of the public transport network interacted with the growth of London.
<p>
<p>In the streets of 19th century London, the horse reigned supreme.  On display are a replica of London's first horse-drawn omnibus of 1829 and a horse tram of the 1880s.  The introduction of the motor bus marked a major step forward.  On show is one of the first successful mass-produced motor buses in the world, the B-type of 1910, and an example of the famous RT-type bus, designed in 1938 and continuing in regular passenger service until 1979.
<p>
<p>London's much-loved electric trams are represented by three vehicles, the 1910 West Ham tramcar, the standard E1 tram and  the luxurious Feltham car of 1931.
<p>
<p>London's (and the world's) first underground railways relied on steam locomotives.  Displayed at mezzanine level is Metropolitan Railway locomotive number 23, built in 1866, which provided motive power for trains on the Metropolitan and the Circle Lines for 40 years.  Alongside stands the electric locomotive, "John Hampden", which hauled trains on the Metropolitan's trunk route into the countryside to the north west of London.

<p>
<p>London Transport's renowned design heritage is also explored at the Museum, with displays on corporate design, graphics, vehicle design and architecture.  The Pick Gallery regularly features exhibitions of posters from the Museum's superb collection, while the Beck Gallery tells the story of the famous map of the London Underground.  This highly-stylised map was designed in the 1930s by a young draughtsman, Harry Beck, who represented each of the lines vertically, horizontally and diagonally.  Rejected at first for being too revolutionary, Beck's map was eventually adopted and developed.  This design "classic" has been copied by metro systems all over the world and has become an icon of London itself.
<p>
<p>
<p><IMG SRC="../museu_s.gif" ALT="The Museum at Work" WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="22">
<BR>Interpretation
<BR>
<p>Clear and accessible display panels allow visitors to delve as deeply as they wish into London's transport history.  The latest high-tech interactive displays and multi-lingual touch-screen facilities allow visitors to explore film and photograph archive material.  Two video wall displays tell the story of London's expansion as transport technology developed, and of the people who made the system work.
<p>
<p>Young visitors are encouraged to get into the driving seat of a bus or a tube train, and to try out the simulators.  Actors playing a wide range of characters from London's transport history bring the vehicles and displays to life.  There are guided tours of the Museum and its collection at weekends, regular lectures, workshops and conferences, and holiday time trails, activities and events designed specially for families.
<p>
<p>
<p>Special exhibitions
<BR>
<p>The two new exhibition galleries, with regularly changing special displays, have been built with high standards of environmental control to allow a much greater range of material to be displayed than previously.
<p>
<p>
<p>Education
<BR>
<p>The Museum is a popular place for educational visits, with over 800 school groups being accommodated each year.  The Museum's Education Service offers a pack containing National Curriculum materials and a range of other resources to support work both at the Museum and in school.  The Education Service also co-ordinates a programme of workshops and activities, and has recently produced a special video to enable schools to prepare for a visit to the Museum.
<p>

<p>London Transport's Education Liaison Officer is also based at the LT Museum and can supply a range of resources, some of which are linked into the National Curriculum, on London Transport, London Underground and London Tramsport Buses.  Behind the scenes schools visits to London Underground and to some of the bus companies which run services on LT's behalf can also be arranged.
<p>
<p>Information and Research facilities
<p>
<p>The Museum houses an Information Centre for visitors who wish to obtain more detailed information on the collections.  Research facilities are also available in the Museum's Reference Library where, by appointment, users can study a wide range of printed material on transport topics, as well as visual records consisting of photographs, slides and posters.
<p>
<p>Commercial Activity
<p>
<p>Responsible for managing and exploiting London Transports copyright assets, the LT Museum has a commercial department which controls and licenses world-wide use of the famous London Transport circle and bar roundel, the Underground map and poster reproductions.
<p>
<p>The Museum Shop
<p>
<p>This popular shop is one of the most successful museum retail outlets in the country.  It offers a wide range of books, souvenirs and gifts, including poster and postcard reproductions of many of London Transport's famous poster commissions dating back to 1908.  A mail order service is also available.
<p>
<p>Corporate Hospitality
<p>
<p>The London Transport Museum is available for corporate hire, and up to 400 guests can be accommodated at evening functions at this attractive and unusual venue.
<p>
<p>Caf
<p>
<p>The Transport Caf, dramatically overlooking the famous Covent Garden Piazza, offers drinks and light refreshments.

<BR>The 1994/97 LT Statement of Strategy identified the following priorities:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>	to provide or secure public transport in London to meet travel needs, and support Government planning policy guidelines
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to continue to press the case for adequate and stable funding, and where appropriate to seek additional resources, particularly from the private sector, to supplement Government grants
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to ensure the continuation of improvements to safety by setting rigorous safety standards and by the application of sensitive investment procedures and working practices for all services provided, or procured, by London Transport
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to secure increased income from fares by positive marketing and modest real fares increases, and to maintain the benefits of Travelcards to passengers while developing new tickets to meet market needs and to ensure ease of purchase
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to continue to improve Underground reliability and service quality, and to work towards achieving a Modern Underground for London early in the next century.  In the short to medium term, priority will be given to maintaining the basic infrastructure of the Underground particularly to improve service reliability
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to continue to plan Londons long-term transport needs particularly with regard to the planning, promotion and construction of new rail lines, the extension of existing lines and light rail schemes
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to enable the bus to play its full rle in meeting Londons transport needs by planning and procuring a high quality comprehensive network of bus services, and by providing reliable passenger information and 	attractive passenger facilities and to minimise the cost through competitive tendering of services
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to seek improved priority for buses on Londons roads, in particular by working with the highway authorities to implement the London Bus Priority Network and the Priority (Red) Route Network
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to contain its own costs and use resources in an efficient and effective manner, for example by promoting competition between bus operators through the agreed programme of bus route tendering and by adopting value-for-money procurement practices and more flexible working arrangements on London Underground
<BR>
<BR>	and
<BR>
<BR><LI> to work with the private bus operators and the rail operators and authorities to ensure that a comprehensive and co-ordinated public transport system is maintained in London including integrated services, ticketing and 	information following the privatisation of the London Transport bus subsidiaries and the franchising of the British Rail Train Operating Companies.

<BR>
London Underground aims to deliver the best possible service for all its customers.
You want a quick, frequent and reliable train service, a safe, clean and welcoming
station environment with up-to-date information and helpful, courteous staff.
This means a continuous, demanding programme of improvements to meet rising expectations.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OUR TARGETS</B></font>
<BR>To drive and measure these improvements, performance targets
covering many aspects of our service have been agreed with Government as part of
the Citizen's Charter programme. If you would like to know more, please contact our
Customer Service Centre, which is open between 0830 and 1730, Mondays to Fridays,
on 0171-918 4040.
We regularly publish our performance against the targets.
Train service Performance information is posted at every station and details of
other targets are available from the ticket office.
<BR>

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OUR REFUND PLEDGE</B></font>
<BR>If you are delayed more than 15 minutes because of our failure, we will give you
a refund voucher to the value of the delayed journey. Please claim by filling in
this form. We cannot give refunds in circumstances which prevent us from safely
running trains such a s a security alert, freak weather or because of action by a
third party; nor when we have publicised in advance an alternative route; for example
because of planned engineering works. Special conditions apply if we have an
industrial dispute. Extra claim forms are available from any station or the Customer
Service Centre.

<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THIS IS YOUR CHARTER</B></font>

<BR>London Transport Buses want to make your journeys as safe, reliable, comfortable and convenient as we can. Our services continue to improve but we know there is more to do.
<BR>
<BR>Your Charter is part of the Government's Citizens Charter initiative designed to improve public services. It describes the standards of service you can expect, and how you can let us know if things go wrong. We need your help to give London a first class bus service .
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>

<BR>We are responsible for most bus services in London.  Bus services are provided under contract by over 30 private bus companies, which are responsible for making sure the services are reliable and that staff are friendly and vehicles well maintained. All the bus companies which provide services for London Transport are committed to this Charter.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>YOUR PRIORITIES</B></font>

<BR>We have asked you what you want from our services. Your priorities are:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>safety;

<BR>
<BR><LI>better quality bus services;
<BR>
<BR><LI>reliable bus services;
<BR>
<BR><LI>improved bus stops, shelters and bus stations;
<BR>
<BR><LI>accurate information on our services; and
<BR>
<BR><LI>measures which allow buses to move more easily through traffic, for example more bus lanes.
<BR></UL>
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>WHAT ARE WE DOING</B></font>
<UL>

<BR><LI>We try to make sure that drivers consider your safety and comfort by driving carefully and stopping as close as they can to the kerb. Many buses and most bus stations now have video cameras to help reduce vandalism and other crimes. All buses now have two- way radios.
<BR>
<BR><LI>We are making our services more reliable by working closely with the highway authorities, police and London boroughs to bring in more bus lanes and other measures to keep buses moving when  traffic is heavy. We work with the police and the councils to deal with the problem of vehicles blocking bus lanes and bus stops;
<BR>
<BR><LI>We are steadily improving bus stops and bus stations. During 1995 we have introduced 1100 new or improved bus shelters and fitted seats at another 250. We are making our information and timetable displays easier to read, and 305 stops now have "Countdown" electronic signs to  tell you when  the next bus will arrive. We aim to keep all of our bus stations and shelters clean and to repair any damage as quickly as we can.
<BR>
<BR><LI>We are reviewing our routes and timetables to make sure that we meet your  needs as closely as possible . We aim to provide at least one bus route within 400 metres of most Londoners' homes, and a direct service to the local town centre;
<BR>
<BR><LI>We always try to make buses easier to use. Brightly coloured handrails, easy-to-reach bell pushes, "bus stopping" signs and clearer destination signs are part of this effort. We have also  introduced low-floor buses on several routes.
<BR>
<BR><LI>We are providing easy access to information and tickets. As well as railway stations there are also 2300 other ticket sales points (mostly local newsagents) throughout London.
<BR></UL>
<BR>
<BR>We are responsible for:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>fares, including Travelcards and Bus Passes;
<BR>
<BR><LI>bus stops, bus stations and shelters;
<BR>
<BR><LI>provide information about bus services and timetables;
<BR>
<BR>and
<BR>
<BR><LI>planning routes.
<BR></UL>
<BR>
<BR>The bus companies providing our services are responsible for:
<UL>
<BR><LI>running of reliable bus services;
<BR>
<BR><LI>making sure that staff are helpful, polite and smartly dressed;
<BR>
<BR><LI>making sure that staff wear some kind of identification;
<BR>
<BR> and
<BR>
<BR><LI>making sure buses are clean, both inside and out;
</UL>
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OUR TARGETS</B></font>

<BR>We aim to provide the best service possible. The Government has set us tough standards of service which we aim to meet or better. We are always checking our performance and every three months we show our results on posters and send details to all the local newspapers.
<BR>

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RELIABILLITY</B></font>
<BR>We know that, above all, you want a reliable bus service. On busy routes, where buses should run at least every 10 minutes, we try to keep waiting times as short as we can . What we measure is "extra waiting time", which is how much longer you wait, on average, than if all buses ran on time.<BR>

</table>
<BR>
<BR>On less busy routes, where buses usually run every 15,20 or 30 minutes, we try to make sure that buses leave each stop at the published times and, in particular, that they do not run early.

It does not count journeys which are cancelled or cut short because of heavy traffic, although we try to cancel as few journeys as possible

25 November 1996

<P>	London Transport and Tramtrack Croydon Limited, with the agreement of the Secretary of State for Transport, today signed the Concession Agreement for Croydon Tramlink.  Work can now commence in earnest on the 99 year concession to design, finance, build, maintain and operate the Croydon Tramlink System whose 28km light rail network links Wimbledon, New Addington, Beckenham  and Elmers End with central Croydon.
<P>	Project Director, Clive Hodson said: "I am pleased to say that the concept of a modern attractive, environmentally friendly, fast, efficient mode of  transport appearing on the streets of South London is to become a reality.
<P>	Clive Hodson continued: "By the year 2000, Tramlink will play its vital role in the South London economy creating many new jobs during construction and some 250 permanent jobs thereafter.  As well as the employment benefits, Tramlink will improve the attractiveness of Croydon and surrounding areas to business, commerce and retailing.
<P>	Tramlink will ultimately benefit the local community by improving east-west travel links and by offering motorists an attractive alternative to the growing problems of traffic congestion in the area."
<P>Tramtrack Croydon comprises CentreWest, Sir Robert McAlpine, Amey Construction, 3i, Bombardier Eurorail and The Royal Bank of Scotland.
<P>Throughout construction and operation, London Transport is responsible to manage the Concession Agreement and monitor operations.  The commercial risks of the system remain with the Concessionaire.

20 November 1996

<P>	Continuing to break down the traditional "fusty" image of museums, the London Transport Museums new advertising campaign features staff modelling a range of colourful clothing and products from its shop in Covent Garden.
<P>	Following a summer advertising programme, the shop campaign builds on the Museums new creative strategy by incorporating colourful images of  staff in bright clothing, superimposed on black and white images from the Museums photographic library.
<P>	One of the staff models is Head Curator Mark Dennison, pictured wearing little more than colourful boxer shorts and a bow tie. "Im always happy to co-operate with my colleagues in Marketing" he said.  "They convinced me that dropping my trousers really could be for the good of the Museum".
	Targeting Christmas shoppers, London commuters and tourists, the adverts can already be seen around the Underground. 
<P>	The London Transport Museum shop has proved to be one of the most successful in museum retailing.  By exploiting some of Londons best know icons - the Underground map, London Transports roundel logo and the famous London bus - the shops range of clothing, souvenirs, posters, gifts and books has proved a hit with tourists and residents alike.
<P>	Demand for the Museums mail order service has soared since the recent launch of  an eye-grabbing range of  boxer shorts and "Babe" style T-shirts using text from Underground signs and notices.  The new range joins other established transport favourites like "Mind the Gap" T-shirts, Underground socks and Tube map ties.  The shop and the Museum are open seven days a week from 1000 - 1800 (1100 on Friday).

<P>
	Keeping buses moving in the face of increasing congestion is the theme of the latest edition of Network magazine, published by London Transport Buses.
<P>	It highlights measures to help buses beat the traffic, like stricter enforcement of bus lane regulations, developing schemes which give buses priority and increasing the powers of traffic wardens.
<P>	The magazine creates a vision of the journey bus passengers might expect by 2001, from obtaining information before travelling to completing the journey quickly and without disruption. It also contains news stories about issues affecting buses and bus users.
	
	Network magazine, which is sent to local authorities, MPs and other key opinion formers, is part of London Transport Buses strategy to promote the role and potential of buses, a vital part of the capitals transport system.

[18 November 1996]
<BR>

<P>	For getting around in Zone 1 on the Tubes,  London Underground has frozen the price of the Carnet, designed to make travelling around central London easier and cheaper.
<P>	The Carnet is ten single tickets in one wallet that can be used for travel on the Underground anywhere in Zone 1.  From the New Year, Carnet will be even greater value with a saving of 2 on buying single Zone tickets, compared with the 1 saving at present.  
<P>	Norman Cohen, London Transports Marketing Director, said: "Were freezing the price of 10, making it even better value for money. Not only does the Carnet save you money, but it is also more convenient, with no need to queue for tickets or worry about having the right change every time you travel."  
<P>	Already the Carnet is proving popular, not only with busy commuters, but also with anyone visiting London who needs to get about in Zone 1.
<P>	The ten separate Carnet tickets can also be used by more than one person.  For example they could be used for lunch with friends, or by  workmates planning to meet for a drink; they each simply take a ticket from a Carnet and hop on the Tube.
<P>	Carnet tickets are available from London Underground ticket offices and adult Carnet can be purchased from larger self service ticket machines at Underground stations and selected Pass Agents.  They are only valid for travel in Zone 1.

<P>	Three prize-winning contemporary poems are included in the new autumn set of Poems on the Underground.
<P>	"Secret Lives" by Sian Hughes, Tracy Ryans "The Lesson" (an anti-pastoral) and "Potosi" by Pauline Steiner, were joint winners in the first Times Literary Supplement / Poems on the Underground poetry competition.  The winning poems were selected from over 3,000 original entries on the theme of "urban life". 	
<P>	The three previously unpublished poems join "Under the Greenwood Tree" by Shakespeare, Pablo Nerudas "Poetry" (lines 1-13) and "Memory of My Father" by Patrick Kavanagh in the 35th set of Poems on the Underground, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year.

13 November 1996



<P>	Plans revealed today by London Transport focus on the importance of public transport in enhancing Londons competitive position as a world city.
<P>	These include a 550 mile Regional Metro system, better links to Heathrow, new road traffic speed targets and improved public transport quality.
<P>	To improve access to the centre from Greater London three regional metros - Thameslink 2000, CrossRail and Chelsea-Hackney Line - are needed.  These lines will remove the need to change for hundreds of thousands of passengers each day, effectively eliminate congestion on the Underground and bring a new quality of travel to the capital.
<P>	Londons airports are vital for the international business and tourist markets.  Better connections to the City and regional rail network are required and local services and interchanges need to be improved.  Extensions to Heathrow Express and the Piccadilly Line are planned if Terminal 5 is built.
<P>	The pressure on Londons Central Area increases as more people come to London and concerns for air quality and the street environment grow.  London Transport advocates greater priority for pedestrians and public transport, with targets for traffic speeds, traffic restraint and Bus Malls where key routes are given special attention.
<P>	Above all improvements in the quality of public transport must continue in order to provide an attractive alternative to the car, including better services, design and information.  The goal of near seamless journeys needs to be vigorously pursued.
<P>	Peter Ford, London Transports Chairman, said on announcing the plans: "Our number one priority is to improve the reliability and efficiency of the existing system.  However, we must look beyond this to see what will be needed in the future to ensure that London retains and enhances its share of the global economy.  Key elements of future plans include sustained investment in London Underground, better bus services and improved management of the road network, implementation of a Regional Metro system and improved links to Heathrow.  These plans will lead to the higher transport standards that will be necessary for the future."

<P>
	Surprising facts are revealed in the recently published Market Report by London Transport. 
<P>	Underground users tend to be drawn from the younger age groups and from social classes A and B rather than reflect Londons population as a whole.  Bus users are, however, rather older and are more likely to be DEs. 
<P>	Women appear to prefer Buses.  Just over half of all Underground journeys are made by males but they make up only 41% of the Bus market.  A very large proportion of Underground journeys are made by the 20-34 age group, contrasting with the fact that 50% of shopping trips on the Buses are made by the over sixties.
	
	The busiest section of line is from Victoria to Sloane Square over which more than 110,000 customers travel each day.
<P>	Victoria, the busiest Underground station, naturally has the highest value of ticket sales.  Somewhat surprisingly, the second highest value of sales is at Heathrow 1,2,3 which reflects the cost of travel from the airport to central London. 
<P>	Since 1992, the Metropolitan, Piccadilly and Bakerloo Lines have had the greatest success in reducing ticket fraud;  the Victoria Line now has the highest level of fare avoidance.  Fraud on the Buses increased during the 1990s, but should be decreasing now because of the introduction of Penalty Fares.  
<P>	The average time a customer has to wait for an Underground train has been decreasing and is now just over three minutes.  At the same time, overcrowding on the Underground has fallen.  Customer satisfaction has steadily increased during the 1990s.
<P>	Most commuters arriving at Paddington continue their journey to work by Tube, but those arriving at Cannon Street prefer to walk.  Waterloo and Liverpool Street are the busiest National Railways points of arrival in the morning peak.
<P>	Half of all taxi and minicab journeys are for leisure purposes.
	
	Only two per cent of the residents of Hackney use the Underground to go to work, compared with 28% in nearby Westminster.
<P>	Car ownership in London has been declining since 1990 and is predicted to continue to go down, but the number of households with two or more cars is now 20% of the total and is forecast to rise even further. Nevertheless, travel by car still dominates trips within London.  Bus and Underground journeys make up most of the remainder.  The highest share of journeys by car is on Sundays, reflecting a greater number of local journeys and the lower frequency of public transport services.
<P>	Some people never use public transport.  Fourteen per cent of Londoners have used neither Bus or Tube in the last twelve months.  Only 18% of Londons population are regular users of Bus and Underground services, although over 20% of Londoners use the Bus at least five times a week (compared with 10% for the Underground). 
	
	More than 60% of Londoners live over 15 minutes walk from an Underground station, compared with 86% who live within five minutes walk of a bus stop.
<P>	The number of One Day Travelcards used on the Underground doubles at the weekend, but there is no change in the type of tickets used on the Buses.
	Londons fares are relatively high, but unlike most major cities LT receives no operating subsidy.

<IMG SRC="evasion.gif" ALT="New Fare Evasion Campaign - A Different Approach" WIDTH="443" HEIGHT="52">
<BR>[29 October 1996]
<BR>

<P>	"London relies on the system that relies on your fare" - thats the message at the heart of a major new fare evasion campaign launched by London Transport today.	
<P>	The campaign seeks to reinforce the importance of fares income in the day-to-day running of Londons transport system.  Despite a Penalty Fares scheme, fare evasion still loses London Underground and London Transport Buses an estimated 36 million each year which could otherwise be reinvested to deliver service improvements to the customer. 
<P>	The first in a series of distinctive, high quality advertisements appear today in the press and on poster sites across London.   Poignant photography underpins the core message, showing how people from all walks of life rely on the capitals public transport system.
<P>	Later phases of the campaign will raise customer awareness on issues including out of zone travel, over-riding and ticket touts. 
<P>	Norman Cohen, LTs Marketing Director said:  "Our high impact campaigns during 1995/6 highlighted the illegality of fare evasion and were generally well received by fare payers.  However, we feel the big stick approach towards Penalty Fares has run its course for the time being.  
<P>	"Londons annual population of 24 million public transport users and the many visitors to the capital recognise clearly the value of the Tube and bus system.  This campaign emphasises the significance of fares income in sustaining and improving the system on which they rely."
<P>	Nick Agnew, London Undergrounds Revenue Services General Manager said:  "Tube passengers who fare dodge are not contributing their fair share towards the very system on which they travel.  This campaign seeks to win these people over then the system as a whole can benefit from the revenue which would otherwise have been lost.
<P>	"Persistent fare evaders also need to understand that we are not going soft on fare evasion - ticket inspections at barriers and on trains will continue.  At the same time we will continue to improve the ticket selling service to reduce the excuses offered for not having a valid ticket."
<P>	Over-riding is a particular problem for London Transport Buses and the next stage of the campaign will also focus on this issue.  Paul London, London Transport Buses Revenue Services Manager said: "Bus passengers who over-ride, i.e. travel further than their fare permits, are contributing to an estimated 22.7 million in lost revenue.
<P>	
	"Later stages of the campaign will encourage bus passengers to make sure they always have the right ticket for their journey.  Despite this, it will be business as usual for our inspectors and the 5 Penalty Fare will remain in use."

[17 October 1996]
<p>

<B>BUT CRACKDOWN SET TO CONTINUE</B>
<P>	The first stage of a network wide crackdown on ticket touts who have cost London Underground an estimated 1 million annually has already reported record numbers of offences and arrests - and the blitz is set to continue! 
<P>	Operation Amazon enters a second phase this week, building on the success of the initial exercise run jointly with the British Transport Police.  Phase one started on 15 July 1996 and in just 13 weeks recorded an astonishing 3,400 offences and 237 arrests at Tube stations across London.
<P>	Phase two of the exercise is run by London Undergrounds Revenue Services and involves 20 Revenue Control Inspectors and six officers from the British Transport Police.  Touts will continue to be reported and arrested, but the exercise will also focus on crime prevention and reinforcing the message to passengers that it is illegal to transfer or purchase used tickets. 
	Nick Agnew, London Undergrounds Revenue Service General Manager said: "Operation Amazon has been very successful at key stations so far.  However, the message remains the same - buy, sell or use a second-hand ticket and you are committing an offence."
<P>	"Most second-hand tickets, if not all, start as legitimate purchases.  Donating, buying or carelessly discarding used tickets denies the Underground revenue which could be used for system improvements."
	
	The dramatic number of offences recorded - particularly at Victoria, Kings Cross and Brixton - has reinforced London Undergrounds earlier estimate of the scale of ticket touting.  The second stage of Operation Amazon demonstrates LULs commitment to reducing theft of revenue which could otherwise be reinvested.
<P>	Inspector Chris Connell of the British Transport Police said:  "Whilst significant, the number of reports and arrests only tell half the story.  Letters banning persistent touts from the system have been served, and injunctions are already in progress for those hard core offenders who have defied them."
<P>	The money raised by touts - estimated to be 13,000 per year - is often used to further other criminal activity.  Undercover BTP officers have confirmed that some touts are working together in gangs and most have no qualms about intimidating passengers.  
<P>	London Undergrounds extensive CCTV network has enabled this threatening behaviour to be recorded and used successfully as evidence in court.
<P>	Recent offensives to combat ticket touts have included a highly successful One Day Travelcard offer in which passengers who saved five Travelcards could claim discounts for meals and up to a third off the costs of selected West End shows.  The offer helped to prevent the fraudulent resale of valid tickets by passengers who would have otherwise discarded them after use, potentially allowing them to be picked up by ticket touts and resold.
<P>	Similar offers that benefit customers while protecting vital revenue for investment in the system are currently under consideration.
<P>FURTHER INFORMATION:
<P>The total number of offences under Byelaw 7 and 22 reported since the commencement of the operation is 3,398.  This consists of 2,363 re-sale offences, 783 revenue related offences and 252 other offences.  There have also been 85 re-sale arrests, 14 revenue related arrests and 138 other arrests, giving a total of 237 arrests.  This gives a cumulative total for Operation Amazon of 3,635 offences.

[4 October 1996]




<P>	Bus users in London are being asked to vote for their favourite route in a unique competition to be judged by the London Regional Passengers Committee, with the full support of London Transport.
<P>	The winning route will have the most helpful staff, the cleanest vehicles and the clearest information.  Points will also be scored for any special features of the route which are highlighted by passengers taking the opportunity to vote.
<P>	Peter Ford, London Transports Chairman, said: "This is an excellent way of recognising the efforts of the team which keeps a route on the road and I congratulate the LRPC for their initiative in this, the sixth year of the competition.  By giving that little bit of extra service-with-a-smile, the staff on the successful routes will receive cash prizes and for the overall winner there is a trophy." 
<P>	Nominations should be sent on a postcard to:
		The London Regional Passengers Committee
		Clements House
		14-18 Gresham Street
		London EC2V 7PR 
including brief reasons, to arrive by 3 November 1996.  
<P>	All voters will enter a free draw which will take place after the closing date.  The first entrant whose name is drawn will win an Annual All Zone Bus Pass, worth 480 at 1996 prices. 
<P>	This years competition will follow the pattern set last year - nominations will be used to form a short list of routes which will then be the subject of a "mystery shopper" survey by the LRPC to objectively test the staff performance against a uniform set of criteria.
<P>Further information:
 <ul>
<li>The competition is judged in three categories:  Big Bus (two person operated), Big Bus (one person operated) and Small Bus.
<li>Previous year's winners of the competition have included routes 12,19, 72, 227, 366, H2 and X15.
<li>All routes operated under contract to London Transport Buses are eligible.
<li>Members of staff of the LRPC and London Transport and their families are not entitled to vote.

<P>
	In the first review of its kind, London Transport today issued "The Impact of New Rail Schemes," demonstrating that overcrowding on train services into central London could be a thing of the past if schemes to extend the tube and rail networks were implemented.
<P>	An in-depth investigation into the impact of major rail projects and how they affect passenger movements in central London, the review looks at the combined effects of schemes including: the Jubilee Line Extension, the Heathrow Express Rail Link, Docklands Light Railway extension to Lewisham, upgrading to the existing Underground network, the Channel Tunnel Rail link to St Pancras, Thameslink 2000, Heathrow Express/Piccadilly Line extensions to Heathrow Terminal 5, CrossRail and the Chelsea-Hackney Line.
<P>	The study is based on forecasts of passenger use of lines and stations, and  identifies the effects on crowding on Underground lines.  At present all lines have at least some sections with passenger loads in excess of  comfortable capacity. 
<P>
	By 2001, the opening of the Jubilee Line Extension plus modernisation on other lines, particularly on the Northern Line, will lead to major improvements,   but widespread overcrowding will remain.  
<P>	The Report goes on to say : "The construction of Crossrail would provide widespread relief, and eliminate crowding over most parts of the network.  The subsequent addition of the Chelsea-Hackney Line would virtually eliminate it."
<P>	David Bayliss, Director of Planning for London Transport said: "This review is a milestone giving, for the first time, a detailed picture of how various schemes for extending Londons railways relate to each other and the existing network.  Although each of the schemes included have had extensive studies carried out individually, this document is unique in showing the benefit of all major schemes and how they affect travelling into and around London. With all the schemes in place overcrowding would be virtually eliminated."

<BR>

	London Transport is pressing local authorities to work with it in partnership to provide greater priority for public transport on the Capitals roads.  This could mean significant investment in new vehicles and infrastructure, ensuring the best that buses can provide, and also possibly introducing trams, trolleybuses and light rail.
<P>	The areas highlighted in the report New Ideas for Public Transport in Outer London are: orbital links to Heathrow Airport, the Uxbridge and Edgware Roads, the A23 to Croydon, Wood Green, Barking and Romford, Thamesmead and Greenwich, and extensions to the Tramlink system in south London.
<P>	David Bayliss, Director of Planning for London Transport said: "I am looking forward to initiating strategies with local authorities to see the recommendations reach successful conclusions.  Choosing the outer London areas represents the greatest challenge to public transport, as population densities are lower than in London as a whole, car ownership and use is high - and growing - and public transports market share is the lowest in London".
	<P>
	The overall aim of the study is to provide an attractive alternative to the car in outer London.  The report states that it is the level of priority on streets which is more important than the mode of public transport - and the total number of people carried is more important the total number of road vehicles.  With priority given to conventional buses in the first instance, which are being developed to use the latest technology to improve air quality, there would be considerable benefits in overcoming traffic build up in local areas.
<P>	Bus based options with a high level of priority are recommended for most of the nine corridors including Romford, Barking, Wood Green, Thamesmead/Greenwich and Heathrow orbital.  Track and bus based options will be considered for the Edgware and Uxbridge Roads where potential demand is highest.  The high demand on the A23  is more likely to be suitable for an extension to the Underground, at least as far as Streatham.  The study also found that it would be difficult to justify substantial investment in the expansion of Croydon Tramlink.
 	<P>
	In each of the nine areas included in the review, the London Bus Priority Network - which itself aims to reduce bus journey times by up to 25% in peak periods - was used as the base strategy.  Two additional higher levels of priority were also tested.  All the proposals focus on improving the environment, providing greater accessibility to town centres and development sites and rely heavily on the support of local authorities to move forward.

<P>London Transport Museum has filled the gap in museum provision for Nursery and Key Stage 1 children by launching two special educational programmes.
<P>	Five to seven-year-olds will be able to travel back in history on a "Time Bus", and escape from a time trap with the help of a Victorian character and a 1930s tram driver.  Nursery and reception children will be able to journey around the Museum on a special "Platform Promenade" led by an actor who uses rhythm, mime and song to bring the Museums colourful buses, trams and Tube trains to life.
<P>	Planned visits are supported by a comprehensive set of curriculum-based educational materials, including teachers notes, teacher/ helper cards on the Museums displays, and a full set of  activity sheets, like "The sad bus", "Wheels" and the "West Ham tram".
<P>	The Nursery and Key Stage 1 pack also provides lots of cross-curricular ideas and activities for the classroom.

[18 September 1996]
<BR>

<BR>	London Transport Buses is helping to fund bus lane enforcement cameras in north London.  The cameras, to be installed inside buses and at the roadside, are part of a 750,000 initiative by the Traffic Director for London.
<BR>
<BR>	Richard Smith, London Transport Buses Market Development Director, said: "Every day, Londons buses and their passengers are delayed because of  inconsiderate motorists.  We welcome this initiative as it has the potential to reduce violations of bus lanes and keep them clear for the purpose for which they are intended."
<BR>
<BR>	Acknowledging that the scheme will have direct benefits for Londons bus passengers, the bus operating companies involved are keen to participate with the introduction of this new technology, with Cowie Leaside and MTL London both involved in this initiative.
<BR>
<BR>	It is estimated that 3.5 million bus passenger journeys are made daily and 55 million hours per year are lost by passengers through delays.  Whilst not all of this is caused through bus lane violations, it is considered that a considerable proportion is.

<IMG SRC="web.gif" ALT="Official London Transport World Wide Web Site Launched" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="52"><BR>
[16 September 1996]
<P>	London Transport has launched an official Internet World Wide Web site.  The site, containing a comprehensive range of useful information on London Transport, London Underground and London Transport Buses, is located at http://www.londontransport.co.uk.
<BR>
<BR>	Every page on the new Web site reflects London Transports corporate identity, using the world-famous roundel to provide links to other pages.  The information held on the site includes a guide to using the transport system, facts and figures, press releases and details of the London Transport Museum. 
<BR>
<BR>	Norman Cohen, London Transports Marketing Director said:
<BR>
<BR>	"London Transport recognises that the Internet is gaining prominence as a global communications medium.   I believe that the time has come for us to provide information to anyone with Internet access in the form of a well-designed World Wide Web site.
<BR>	
<BR>	"Our new Web site delivers a major benefit particularly to overseas visitors who can collect essential information before leaving home, easily and cheaply.  However, I  am sure that all visitors to the site will appreciate the straightforward design and depth of information which it offers."
<BR>
<BR>	The site is the fruit of over two months work by Internet production company Corsellis-Montford Group Plc, as James Corsellis explained: 
<BR>	
<BR>	"We have relished the opportunity of working so closely with London Transport on the development of their Internet presence and on the design and creation of their Web site.
<BR>
<BR>	"Our Internet production and design experience, in conjunction with the ideas and feedback from London Transports skilled Marketing Department, has resulted in a site of which the teams can collectively be proud."

<p>
	Countdown, the information display showing the time to wait for the next bus, is to be installed at bus stops London-wide.  The dot-matrix indicators, similar to those on the Underground, will be installed at more  than 4,000 major bus stops.
<p>	The Secretary of State for Transport today announced the go-ahead for a major extension of the present scheme.
<p>	Richard Smith, London Transport Buses Market Development Director, said: "When the scheme is complete, passengers waiting at all our most-used bus stops will know exactly how long it will be before their bus is due to arrive.  We will have removed the greatest uncertainty about bus travel, which in turn will increase passenger confidence and allow buses to play an increasingly important role in public transport.
<p>
<BR>"The pilot projects have generated additional bus travel and with London-wide introduction, Countdown will have a key role in getting more people to use the buses."
<BR>	
<BR>	Countdown was pioneered on LT route 18 in 1992 and has since been expanded to cover 400 stops on 40 bus routes in west and north east London.  The Capitals passenger-information-at-bus-stops project is already the largest in the world and will be the first to cover a whole major conurbation.  Plans are already progressing to bring Countdown to Kingston and Lambeth during 1997.

6 September 1996							

<p>London Transports Bus Station in Stratford, East London, will be awarded a 1996 Civic Trust Design Award for raising awareness and standards through design.  
<p>	London Transport Buses will be presented with the award and plaque for the station by representatives from the Civic Trust at West Ham Town Hall at 1500 on Tuesday, 10 September, at a ceremony hosted by Councillor Shama Ahmed, Mayor of Newham.
<p>	The eye-catching 2 million structure was completed at the end of 1994.   Designed in-house, the brain-child of Architect Soji Abass is only one aspect of the redevelopment partnership involving London Transport, City Challenge and the London Borough of Newham.  
<p>	Adjacent to Stratford Underground, mainline and Docklands Light Railway station, the brightly lit bus station provides a safe and comfortable environment for passengers.  It combines facilities, including a restaurant and kiosks, with accessibility to the Town Centre via a pedestrian walkway.  
<p>	The Civic Trust is an independent charity whose chief aim is to improve the environment.  Achieved by several methods, the Trust encourages high standards through a network of awards, commendations and special mentions.  Stratford Bus Station was awarded the highest local category.  
<p>	Richard Smith, Market Development Director of London Transport Buses said: "Stratford is now seeing a transformation of development and regeneration.  As part of the improved transport links, London Transport Buses has put Stratford back on the map.  The bus station is a striking structure and the award recognises the enthusiasm and hard work of everyone involved in the project."

<BR>[22 August 1996]
<BR>
<BR>	Since its launch in March this year, a total of 118,613 books of Carnets have been sold, proving that London Transports new initiative for "designer" tickets caters for individual types of passengers.
<BR>
<BR>	The cost efficient Carnets is a book of ten single tickets can be used on the Underground anywhere in zone one and are valid for up to 12 months.  The ten ticket Carnet gives passengers a saving of 1 on the cost of ten single zone one tickets.  Carnets can be purchased at any zone one London Underground station or PASS agent.
<BR>
<BR>	Designed to be kept and used at the passengers convenience, Carnet is very adaptable to passengers needs and allows ticket users to hop on and off the Tube at a moments notice.
<BR>
<BR>	Businesses in London will soon be able to get on board the Tube with Carnet, giving them to employees when they need to go to meetings in zone one.  The benefits to employers are numerous.  Not only do they save on expensive, time consuming taxi journeys but because of the efficiency and convenience of the Tube, the Carnet is also transferable from one person to another.
<BR>
<BR>	 A spokesperson from London Transport commented: " The new ticket is an attractive offer for both new and existing passengers, especially tourists and leisure travellers.  Its appeal is wide ranging, suiting a foreign visitors planning a few days sightseeing around central London, to two working friends out of an impromptu shopping spree during their lunch hour".

<BR>
<BR>	See Baker Street, Farringdon and Loughton Underground Stations on Sunday 15 September, when London Transport will be welcoming visitors as its contribution to London Open House Day.
<BR>
<BR>	Visitors will have the opportunity to admire the architectural features of stations which on weekdays they rush through without a second glance.  Parts of Baker Street and Farringdon Stations date from the 1860s, when London led the world in introducing railways underground.  In contrast, Loughton is one of the finest examples of late 1930s architecture.
<BR>
<BR>	Although the regular guided tours from 1100 to 1700 are free, visitors to Baker Street and Farringdon will need a Travelcard valid for Zone 1 or a Platform Ticket (cost 40p) just before they join the tour.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>	Public transport is an ideal and trouble free way of visiting the buildings which are open to the public on 14/15 September, especially with a discounted Family or Weekend Travelcard.  For journeys on the Underground in Zone 1, a Carnet of ten single tickets gives a 10% saving on normal fares.
<BR>
<BR>	London Open House is co-ordinating arrangements for over 350 buildings throughout Greater London which will be specially open as part of a Europe-wide cultural event.  Full details are available from the organisers on 0181 347 6007.

<P>	The London Transport Museum in Covent Garden has become the first London museum to be awarded the Investors in People employment accreditation.
<P>	The Investors in People (IIP) scheme sets national standards for companies to improve their performance by communicating with and developing their employees.  The scheme provides benchmarks for good management practice, training, evaluation and personnel policies.
<P>	The London Transport Museum first embarked on working towards the award after it underwent a major redisplay in 1993.  To win the award, the Museum was judged on written and oral evidence provided to an independent assessor by staff throughout the organisation.
<P>	London Transport Museum Director Sam Mullins paid tribute to everyone working at the Museum: "This is great recognition for all Museum staff for an achievement well earned and hard won.  Ive always known we had a great team here, dedicated to making ours a world class museum, but its fantastic to have it officially recognised by someone outside the organisation".
<P>	The Museum gained the IIP award with the help of CENTEC (Central London Training and Enterprise Council).  Gwyneth Flower, CENTECs Chief Executive said of the Museums success: "We are particularly pleased that one of Londons most impressive tourist attractions has been recognised for excellence in people and business development.  Tourism is a key growth industry within the CENTEC area and we are committed to helping companies within the sector become more competitive, in order to maintain Londons status as the business capital of the world.  CENTEC are proud that the London Transport Museum is an Investors in People ambassador, leading the way forward in London".

<P>	Coming soon to the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden is "The Paranoia of a London Attach Case," an art installation by David Cotterell, one of the artistic team who recently papier machd two house fronts in Vauxhall, South London. 
<P>	Produced using London Transports CCTV equipment, Cotterells installation consists of seven, twenty-two minute video recordings playing concurrently.  The videos track the movements of an attach case as it is carried by an actor through the labyrinth of tunnels, platforms and escalators at Monument / Bank Underground stations.
<P>	By pre-determining the cameras used and the route taken, the actor appears to walk in sequence from one monitor to the next - and occasionally, to be in two places at the same time - while the actors rhythmic footsteps accompany the surreal images on the monitors.
<P>	This atmospheric installation was inspired by Cotterells desire to use real security cameras to tell a narrative story.  He describes CCTV as "the most available, yet least accessible way of making a film," adding: "We all think were anonymous in a crowd of commuters, but everyones a movie star on a video tape somewhere."
<P>	In keeping with some of the artistic themes behind the film, a monitor outside the Museums Pick Gallery will relay footage of visitors watching the show inside.
<P>	The installation will be on display in the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden from 31 August until 13 October 1996.  Entrance to the video art installation is free with the price of admission to the Museum.

<BR>[19 August 1996]
<BR>
<BR>	Since the launch of London Transports Family Travelcard this spring, over 1,170,000 families have benefited from this convenient way of making the most from trips around London.
<BR>
<BR>	On average 50,000 tickets have been sold every week since its launch, highlighting the success of London Transports new initiative of "designer" tickets aimed at specific types of passengers.  A record 111,915 Family Travelcards have been sold in just one week during the summer holiday.
<BR>
<BR>	One of three new tickets launched this spring, the Family Travelcard helps families cut the cost of taking the kids around London for a day out.  The new Travelcard also offers a practical and moneysaving alternative to using the car, battling through traffic and parking problems.
<BR>
<BR>	A family group buying the Family Travelcard will save 20% on the price of a normal Adult One Day Travelcard, and children travel for a flat fare of 50 pence each.
<BR>
<BR>	The Family Travelcard is flexible enough to suit different sized family groups - from a group of just two (one adult with one child) to a group of ten (two adults accompanied with as many as eight children).
<BR>
<BR>	A spokesperson from London Transport says: "The Family Travelcard is such good value for money it has proved to be a real winner.  London has so much to offer and London Transport bus and Tube services are the ideal way to get around".

<BR>[19 August 1996]
<BR>
<BR>	Plants brightly flourish on many London Tube stations often in the face of adversity.  Thirty stations are so proud of their efforts that they have entered London Undergrounds very own flower competition, which is being judged this week.
<BR>
<BR>	Pippa Greenwood of BBCs Gardeners Questiontime and the
<BR>Daily Mirror will be consulting with the other judges who are senior staff and retired staff of London Transport with horticultural expertise.  Stations included range from Hatton Cross in the west to Elm Park in the east, and from Chesham in the north to Morden in the south.
<BR>
<BR>	Underground stations which Pippa has elected to visit are mainly in central London, where she can offer advice and suggestions to staff whose gardens are afflicted most by adverse conditions.  Raised beds and hanging baskets quickly become dry, yet watering has to be carried out entirely by hand.  And trains rush past every few minutes, sometimes only a few feet away.
<BR>
<BR>	Pippa Greenwood says: "I was brought up in London, and have always enjoyed travelling by Tube.  Its a great pleasure to be involved with the Station Gardens competition, as these flowers look really wonderful.  The staff are very committed to the self imposed task, which brings splashes of natural colour into Tube travellers journeys."

5 August1996

<P>	One of the most popular art forms of the past decade will receive a boost in August when a new set of Poems on the Underground is posted in Tube cars throughout London.
<P>	Now in its tenth successful year, the new set includes poems from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries.  They are:
<UL>
<LI>His return to London by Robert Herrick (1591-1674)
<LI>I taste a liquor never brewed by Emily Dickinson (1831-1886)
<LI>The Poet by George Mackay Brown (1921-1996)
<LI>Greenwich Park by Herbert Lomas (b. 1924)
<LI>Apology by Mimi Khalvati (b. 1944)
<LI>and by popular demand, from an earlier set: So well go no more a roving by Lord Byron (1788-1824).
</UL>
	A number of celebrations are planned to mark the tenth anniversary of  Poems on the Underground.  These include a poetry competition, run with the Times Literary Supplement, an exhibition of posters from the past ten years of Poems on the Underground at the Poetry Library on the South Bank Centre, an evening of poetry and music at the Barbican Centre on Wednesday 9 October and a poetry evening at the London Transport Museum on Thursday 28 November.
<P>	Following the huge success of  Poems on the Underground in London, poetry on public transport is now flourishing world wide.  Schemes are already well-established in Ireland, America, Australia, Scandanavia, France and Germany.  The British Council displays the London poems in over 100 libraries throughout the world.  The London "Tube" poems were displayed recently on public transport systems in Oslo and Helsinki and an exchange of poems with the Paris Metro is currently under discussion.
<P>	The poems used in the series are selected by Judith Chernaik, Gerard Benson and Cicely Herbert, and designed by Tom Davidson.  London Transport pays all of the production costs for the series and provides advertising space for the poems.  The programme also receives financial support from the British Library (Stefan Zweig Programme), London Arts Board, and the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.
<P>1. The popular anthology of all poems displayed on the Underground, "Poems on the Underground", 5th edition (Cassell 6.99) the "Poems on the Underground" Audiobook (Cassell 7.99); along with Love Poems (1.99); and Comic Poems (1.99) are available from the London Transport Museum shop in Covent Garden and all good book shops.  Posters of the individual poems are also available from the London Transport Museum shop.  The Museum also runs a subscription service for poem posters (both new and previous poems).

<BR><B>Poems - 4</B>
<BR><B>from "His Return to London" by Robert Herrick (1591-1674)</B>
<p>From the dull confines of the drooping West,
<BR>To see the day spring from the pregnant East,
<BR>Ravished in spirit, I come, nay more, I fly
<BR>To thee, blessed place of my nativity! ...
<BR>O fruitful Genius! that bestowest here
<BR>An everlasting plenty, year by year.
<BR>O place! O people! Manners! framed to please
<BR>All nations, customs, kindreds, languages!
<BR>London my home is: though by hard fate sent
<BR>Into a long and irksome banishment;
<BR>Yet since called back; henceforward let me be,
<BR>O native country, repossessed by thee!


<P><BR><B>"I taste a liquor never brewed" by Emily Dickinson (1831-1886)</B>
<p>I taste a liquor never brewed -
<BR>From Tankards scooped in Pearl -
<BR>Not all the Vats upon the Rhine
<BR>Yield such an Alcohol!
<P>Inebriate of Air - am I -
<BR>And Debauchee of Dew -
<BR>Reeling - thro endless summer days -
<BR>From inns of Molten Blue -
<P>When "Landlords" turn the drunken Bee
<BR>Out of the Foxgloves door -
<BR>When Butterflies - renounce their "drams" -
<BR>I shall but drink the more!
<P>Till Seraphs swing their snowy Hats -
<BR>And Saints - to windows run -
<BR>To see the little Tippler 
<BR>Leaning against the - Sun -


<P><BR><B>Poems - 5</B>
<BR><B>"So well go no more a-roving" by Lord Byron (1788-1824)</B>
<P>So well go no more a-roving
<BR>	So late into the night,
<BR>Though the heart be still as loving,
<BR>	And the moon be still as bright.
<P>For the sword outwears its sheath,
<BR>	And the soul wears out the breast,
<BR>And the heart must pause to breathe,
<BR>	And Love itself have rest.
<P>Though the night was made for loving,
<BR>	And the day returns too soon,
<BR>Yet well go no more a-roving
<BR>	By the light of the moon.



<P><BR><B>"The Poet" by George Mackay Brown (1921-1996)</B>
<p>Therefore he no more troubled the pool of silence.
<BR>But put on mask and cloak,
<BR>Strung a guitar
<BR>And moved among the folk.
<BR>Dancing they cried
<BR>"Ah, how our sober islands
<BR>Are gay again, since this blind lyrical tramp
<BR>Invaded the Fair!"
<P>Under the last dead lamp
<BR>When all the dancers and masks had gone inside
<BR>His cold stare
<BR>Returned to its true task, interrogation of silence.
<P><BR><B>"Greenwich Park" by Herbert Lomas (b.1924)</B>
<BR>Springs come, a little late, in the park:
<BR>a tree-rat smokes flat Ss over the lawn.
<BR>A mallard has somehow forgotten something
<BR>it cant quite remember.  Daffodils yawn,
<BR>prick their ears, push their muzzles out
<BR>for a kiss.  Pansies spoof pensive
<BR>Priapus faces: Socrates or Verlaine.
<BR>A cock-pigeon is sexually harassing
<BR>a hen: pecking and poking and padding
<BR>behind her impertinently, bowing and mowing.
<BR>But when hes suddenly absent-minded -
<BR>cant keep even sex in his head -
<BR>she trembles, stops her gadding, doubts
<BR>and grazes his way.  He remembers and pouts.
<P>
<BR><B>Poems - 6</B>
<P><B>"Apology" by Mimi Khalvati (b.1944)</B>
<p>Humming your Nocturne on the Circle Line,
<BR>unlike the piano, running out of breath
<P>Ive been writing you out of my life
<BR>my loves (one out, one in).
<P>Ive pushed you out of the way to see
<BR>what the gaps in my life might look like,
<P>how large they are,
<BR>how quickly I could write them in;
<P>and not (at least till Ive lost you both)
<BR>rewriting you only means

<br>[22 July 1996]
<BR>
<br>	London Transport (LT) is enthusiastic in making further progress in improving its environmental record, building on the high standards it achieves already.  With the help of central and local government, it can deliver an even more efficient and environmentally friendly public transport system, vital to the needs of a thriving economy.
<br>
<br>	In a response to the Department of the Environments report: "Indicators of Sustainable Development for the United Kingdom", Peter Ford, LTs  Chairman, said: "Environmental issues are of increasing importance to London - World city status requires a clean and healthy environment to attract tourism and wealth-creating enterprise.  There is widespread agreement that a greater proportion of travel must take place by public transport if environmental objectives are to be met.
<br>
<br>	"London Transports record on public transport patronage and operational efficiency is good in both national and international comparisons."
<br>
<br>	LTs response contains three main messages:
<BR><UL>
<br><LI>First, that the indicators selected should show clearly the performance of different modes of transport, thereby demonstrating the importance of a high quality public transport system as a key component of a sustainable transport policy.
<BR>
<br><LI>Second, that Londons public transport system performance, with good network coverage and high levels of service delivered efficiently, enables travellers in London to choose public transport for a greater proportion of their trips than most other places in the UK.
<BR>
<br><LI>Third, that London Transport could contribute even more to sustainable development, but is dependent upon adequate conditions being provided by the policies of both central and local government.
<br></UL>

In welcoming the Governments efforts to develop sustainable indicators to promote economic development within the UK, LT recognises that the management of the transport system is a key component in improving environmental performance and is committed to playing a full part in the process.
<br>
<br>A copy of the report "London Transports Response to the DoE Report:  Indicators of Sustainable Development for the United Kingdom" is enclosed.  Further copies can be obtained from London Transport Corporate Relations, 4th Floor, 55 Broadway, London SW1H 0BD.

<IMG SRC="amazon.gif" ALT="Operation Amazon Targets Ticket Touts" WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="26">
<BR>[15 July 1996]
<BR>

<br>	The crackdown on ticket touts who defraud London Underground out of an estimated 1 million per year is set to intensify today (Monday 15 July) with the launch of Operation Amazon,  a major initiative covering the entire Underground network.
<br>
<br>	Operation Amazon, a joint campaign between London Undergrounds Revenue Services and the British Transport Police, follows the recent action taken by London Underground to ban ten convicted ticket touts from the system.
<br>
<br>	During the last eighteen months reported touting problems have escalated and many stations now suffer from this type of offence.  London Underground has recorded a corresponding increase in the number of customers complaining of harassment and intimidation by touts on or outside stations.
<br>
<br>	To combat this growing menace, London Underground and the British Transport Police intend to actively pursue all offenders during Operation Amazon.  People who already have convictions for touting will be arrested with a view to obtaining injunctions banning persistent offenders from the system.
<br>	Most people giving away tickets do not know that touts operate in organised gangs and are actually making a living from the trade - some touts are estimated to earn over 13,000 a year.  This revenue lost through tout transactions contributes towards higher fare levels for all Underground customers.
<br>
<br>	Nick Agnew, London Undergrounds General Manager (Revenue Support) said: "People attempting to, or actually buying or selling used tickets from touts need to be aware that they are committing an offence under the London Transport Byelaws.   In addition, anyone caught travelling with a second-hand ticket is committing a criminal offence under the Railways Act which has a maximum 1,000 fine or three months in prison.
<br>
<br>	"We fully intend to pursue a proactive prosecution policy with a view to obtaining injunctions banning persistent offenders from the system.  The number of arrests at problem stations will be displayed  for customers to see."
<br>
<br>	Recent offensives to combat ticket touts have already included a highly successful One Day Travelcard offer in which passengers who saved five Travelcards could claim discounts for meals and up to a third off the costs of selected West End shows.  The offer helped to prevent the fraudulent resale of valid tickets by passengers who would have otherwise discarded them after use, potentially allowing them to be picked up by ticket touts and resold.
<br>
<br>	London Underground has also called on local authorities to help in tackling the ticket tout problems.  Under the Local Authorities Act 1990 (amended 1994) any ticket touts found operating outside stations can face prosecution under this Act.
<br>
<br>	In addition, plain clothes London Underground Revenue Control Inspectors and British Transport Police have previously targeted key stations where ticket touts are operating.

3 July 1996

<p>	An eye-grabbing new range of  boxer shorts and "Babe" style T-shirts aimed at the seriously fashion conscious city dweller has been launched by the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden.
<P>	Featuring text from Underground signs and notices, the cheeky boxers give a whole new meaning to familiar phrases like "Open flap for ventilation", "Fire Extinguisher", "Emergency Exit" and "Penalty for improper use 50".  The boxers are available in green, navy and red and come in large and extra large sizes (6.99 each).
<P>	The hug-me-tight "Babe" T-shirts also use transport slogans to help clubbers who want to stand out on the dance floor -  "Hold Tight", "Angel" and "Lost Property" will all make their impression.  Simple and effective, the "Babe" range of T-shirts come in black, white and orange in one size at 9.99 each.

<p>	Also hot off the catwalk is the Museums new range of lime green and orange T-shirts sporting black Underground logos (one size, extra large 11.99 each) and a bright blue T-shirt with "the Tube" in luminous green lettering (medium and extra large sizes, 8.99 each).
<P>	The new boxers and T-shirts are moving quickly off the rails at the London Transport Museums popular shop in Covent Garden Piazza, along with other established transport favourites like "Mind the Gap" T-shirts, Underground socks and Tube map ties.  The shop and the Museum are open seven days a week from 1000 - 1800 (1100 on Friday).
<P>	For more details, contact the London Transport Museum shop on 0171 379 6344.  For details of mail order, ring 0171 240 3396.

<IMG SRC="emissi.gif" ALT="London Bus Exhaust Emissions To Become Cleaner" WIDTH="339" HEIGHT="52">
<br>[1 July 1996]
<BR>
<br>	The levels of polluting emissions from London bus exhausts are set to be cut dramatically following the announcement that London Transport Buses is willing to fund the adoption of ultra-low sulphur, highly refined diesel fuels for all bus operators.  In mainland Europe these fuels are called City Diesel.
<br>
<br>	The move, welcomed by the Secretary of State for Transport, Sir George Young, stems from London Transport Buses emissions research programme.  The biggest programme conducted in the UK to date, it is investigating the potential of green fuels and new exhaust treatment technologies for reducing exhaust emissions.
<br>
<br>	An initial three month trial showed, in comparison with standard diesel fuel, City Diesel decreases visible smoke and smell, cuts down levels of particulates (PM) by over 40% and also reduces carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  PM and NOx are the exhaust emissions which cause the most concern.  City Diesel substantially exceeds the new EC fuel standards which come into force from October 1996.
<br>
<br>	Sir George Young said:  "I welcome the results of the pilot trials, one of a number of initiatives to improve the quality of air in the UK.  Cleaner exhaust emissions from high quality fuel is a positive step in the right direction and gives buses an even greater environmental advantage.  LT Buses decision to sponsor the use of higher quality fuels will provide substantial benefits to Londoners."
<br>
<br>	Clive Hodson, Managing Director of London Transport Buses said: "Despite the critics, buses are already the most environmentally-friendly form of motorised road transport and diesel still remains the most economical , practical and least polluting fuel in common usage.
<br>
<br>	"However, there is no room for complacency where air quality is concerned.  The trials of Greenergy City Diesel showed that use of the right fuel can dramatically reduce the most harmful exhaust emissions.  Accordingly, we are funding the adoption of high quality fuels as fuel contracts come up for renewal.  Already a number of operators are in discussion with fuel suppliers to make the change to higher quality fuels."
<br>
<br>	Two of Londons leading bus operators, Stagecoach East London and Cowie South London, volunteered to take part in the initial emissions research trials.  The scheme was funded by LT Buses with assistance on testing from Westminster City Council.
<br>
<br>	Cowie South London converted 91 buses to run on Greenergy City Diesel - an ultra-low sulphur, highly refined fuel - and 18 of these were also fitted with Eminox / Johnson Matthey Oxidising Catalysts.
<br>
<br>	Stagecoach East London fitted five similar Oxidising Catalysts.  Additionally, as part of the Stagecoach Groups Environmental Policy, Stagecoach East London decided to convert its entire fleet of 600 vehicles nine months early to operate on Shell Low Sulphur Fuel, the European standard from October 1996.
<br>
<br>	Greenergy City Diesel proved to substantially reduce emissions.   Oxidising Catalysts achieved further improvements.  Testing of Oxidising Catalysts is being conducted to ensure this relatively new technology is reliable and that performance improvements can be sustained.  Further testing is also underway of other options to reduce emissions and to compare the results with the impact of using new vehicles on current standard fuels.
<br>
<br>	The testing involved sophisticated pollution analysis at Millbrook Proving Ground using a specifically designed test cycle on a representative selection of vehicles to precisely reproduce the operation of a bus in central London. In addition, a Department of Transport approved Opacity Meter was used to measure visible smoke.
<BR>
<br>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PARTICULATES</B></font>
<br>One of the most significant features of the trials conducted by London Transport Buses is the reduction in the mass of particulates in the smaller size ranges.  Chemical analysis of the particulates at Millbrook showed positively that the particulates which were most effectively treated in the trials were those which lay in the small size band, i.e. below 1 micron and with a peak of effectiveness around 0.5 microns.
<br>
<br>Although the medical effects of particulates are not yet fully understood, informed opinion suggests that the smaller particles below 1 micron are the most injurious to health because they can more easily penetrate human airways and lung capillaries.  A particulate is a tiny piece of carbon which in itself is probably not especially harmful.  However, adhering to the grain of carbon are a number of substances including volatile organic fractions and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  It is these chemicals which may be carcinogenic, and the most harmful to health, and which appear to be especially reduced in the trials.
<BR>
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LONDON TRANSPORT BUSES' EMISSIONS RESEARCH PROGRAMME</B></font>
<br>London Transport Buses Emissions Research Programme centred on an initial intensive three month pilot study of green fuels and new technology on over 700 London Buses with the aim of reducing emission levels from bus exhausts throughout the capital.
<br>
<br>Cowie South London and Stagecoach East London volunteered to undertake trials of various pollution control methods, although some operators were unable to take part because of existing contracts with other fuel suppliers.
<br>
<br>In addition to tests involving current standard diesel (0.2% sulphur) Cowie South London converted 91 buses to Greenergy City Diesel - an ultra-low sulphur, highly refined diesel fuel - and 18 of these were also fitted with Johnson Matthey Oxidising Catalysts.
<br>
<br>Stagecoach East London converted its entire fleet of 600 vehicles to operate on Shell Low Sulphur Fuel (0.05% sulphur) which will become the European Standard from 1 October 1996.  The tests compared the use of this fuel with and without Oxidising Catalysts.
<br>
<br>Two testing regimes were employed.  The first involved the use of a Department of Transport approved Opacity Meter every six weeks to test for visible smoke on all the vehicles involved in the trial.  The second involved trials at the Millbrook Proving Ground.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OPACITY (visible smoke)</B></font>
<br>
<br>Stagecoach East London
<br>Neither the fleetwide move from standard diesel to Shell reduced sulphur diesel (0.05% sulphur), or the use of Oxydising Catalysts made any consistent difference in either the visibility of exhaust smoke or the opacity as measured by the Department of Transport approved meter.
<br>
<br>Cowie South London
<br>Visible smoke had been immediately and permanently reduced for the whole of the bus fleet operating from Brixton Garage using City Diesel.  Opacity readings using the Department of Transport approved meter were also significantly reduced for the majority of vehicles.  No significant change in fuel consumption has been noted so far.  Those vehicles fitted with oxydising catalysts showed a further marginal improvement in opacity readings.
<br>
<br>The suppliers of City Diesel, Greenergy, had stated in advance of the trials that there would be a period during which their fuel cleaned the engine combustion areas, and that as a result, full efficiency could not be expected for some six weeks.  This statement was confirmed in practice by a steady improvement in metered opacity values.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE MILLBROOK TRIALS</B></font>

<br>Millbrook Proving Ground in Bedfordshire was contracted by London Transport Buses to carry out a programme of sophisticated exhaust emission monitoring throughout the trials.
<br>
<br>A representative sample of vehicles were transferred to Millbrook and tested using a specifically designed test cycle, now known as The London Test Cycle, which precisely reproduces the operation of a bus in central London.  The tests covered all legislated pollutants, with the addition of a detailed analysis of particulates, using a machine which is the first of its type in the world.
<br>
<br>The Test Programme
<br>The road characteristics for each  vehicle type were established so that the dynamometer in its Variable Temperature Emission Chamber could be set precisely to reproduce the operations of the bus in London.
<br>
<br>Each vehicle and combination of fuel and catalyst was then subjected to the following tests:-
<br><UL>
<br>Legislated emissions
<BR><LI>Carbon monoxide	(CO)
<BR><LI>Hydrocarbons	(HC)
<BR><LI>Oxides of nitrogen	(NOx)
<BR><LI>Particulates		(PM)
<br></UL>
<br>Detailed analysis of PM including
<br><UL>
<BR><LI>Volatile Organic Fractions
<BR><LI>Poly Aromatic Hydrocarbons
<BR><LI>Anions
<BR><LI>Metals
<BR><LI>Real-time particulate mass and numbers in 13 size bands from 10 microns down to 0.03 microns.
<br></UL>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE MILLBROOK TRIALS</B></font>
<br>
<br>The following outlines the results of the tests of the effects of City Diesel and of Oxidising Catalysts using both City Diesel and Shell reduced sulphur diesel.  The results using catalysts are from the initial proving trials and combined reliability in achieving these improvements is now being studied over an extended trial.
<br>Table 1 (attached) provides comparison of the results.
<br>
<br>Cowie South London
<br>The effects of changing from standard diesel to Greenergy City Diesel were:

</TABLE>
<br>
<br>Sophisticated analysis of the particulates showed a significant reduction in both the number of particles and in the mass of the particles, particularly in the smaller ranges.
<br>
<br>Vehicles using Greenergy City Diesel with oxydising catalysts showed the following further changes:
<br><BR>
<table width="450">
<TR><TD>Carbon dioxide</TD><TD align="right">no change</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Nitrogen oxides</TD><TD align="right">no change</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Particulates</TD><TD align="right">-50%</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Fuel consumption</TD><TD align="right">no change</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<br><BR>
 Using standard fuel as a base, the following overall improvements (i.e. compared with Greenergy City Diesel with a cat) were obtained:
<br><BR>
<table width="450">
<TR><TD>Carbon dioxide</TD><TD align="right">no change</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Nitrogen oxides</TD><TD align="right">- 10%</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Particulates</TD><TD align="right">- 71%</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Fuel consumption</TD><TD align="right">no change</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<br>Again, looking at the overall results, although there was a reduction in the numbers of particulates in all size bands, the most significant improvement was in the reduction of the mass of the smaller particles, similar to the results in the East London fleet.
<br>
<br>Stagecoach East London
<br>The tests at Stagecoach East London measured the improvements brought about by the use of Oxidising Catalysts on vehicles running on Shell reduced sulphur diesel (0.05% sulphur).  No comparison was possible of the impact of Shell reduced sulphur fuel compared to the current standard.  The following changes were proven:
<BR>
<br><table width="450">
<TR><TD>Carbon dioxide</TD><TD align="right">negligible</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Nitrogen oxides</TD><TD align="right">negligible</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Particulates</TD><TD align="right">- 50%</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Fuel consumption</TD><TD align="right">negligible</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<br>
<br>Sophisticated analysis of the particulates showed that the numbers of particles had decreased slightly, whilst their mass showed a substantial reduction.  The reduction in mass was greatest in particles having a diameter of less than 0.35 microns (1 micron is 1 millionth of a metre.  Particles as small as 0.05 microns were measured, this being probably a molecule of carbon.).

<BR>[27 June 1996]
<BR>

<br>	Disabled and encumbered passengers can travel across London more easily from Saturday 29 June.  New routes SL1 and SL2 will run super low-floor, disabled access buses clockwise and anti-clockwise, linking Londons mainline stations.
<br>
<br>	Sir Alan Bailey, Deputy Chairman of London Transport Bus Board, with responsibility for disabled passenger issues, said: "For those people who find crossing London something of a challenge, these station link buses are a boon.  The buses provide a roll-on, roll-off facility for wheelchairs, buggies, and heavy luggage on wheels.  Our previous Stationlink service set a standard which proved so popular, that we have expanded the service, utilising the most modern mobility low floor buses available."
<br>
<br>	The new Optare Excel low-floor buses which provide easy access for disabled, elderly and encumbered passengers was demonstrated.  The SL1 and SL2 run every day (except Christmas Day and Boxing Day), from 0815 to 2105, hourly in both directions.
<br>
<br>	SL1 and SL2 easy accessibility buses not only link Londons mainline stations, but at Victoria Coach Station and Paddington Station link with wheelchair accessible Airbuses A1 and A2 to and from
<br>Heathrow.
<br>
<br>	These buses have been built by Optare Ltd, and are operated by F E Thorpe &amp; Sons whose contract was renewed last year after competitive tendering of the new service pattern.

<BR>[20 June 1996]
<BR>
<br>	Tourists staying in west London can now travel to Hampton Court Palace faster on London Undergrounds District Line to Richmond followed by the R68 bus route.
<br>
<br>	The District Line, London United buses and Royal Parks and Palaces have joined forces to promote quicker day trips, taking about an hour, by Tube and bus.
<br>
<br>	To make the trip, passengers should just board the District Line and alight at Richmond.  Trains run every 5 to 10 minutes.  The R68 bus stop is outside Richmond Station and runs directly to Hampton Court Palace.  These buses run approximately every 15 minutes.
<br>
<br>	A return ticket is just 3.00 with a Zone  2, 3, 4, 5, 6 One Day Travelcard, which allows unlimited travel by Underground and London Transport Buses throughout Zones 2 to 6, after 0930 Mondays to Fridays and all day at weekends.

<IMG SRC="queen.gif" ALT="Queen's Birthday Award for LT Man" WIDTH="355" HEIGHT="26">
<BR>[17 June 1996]
<br>
<br>	London Transports Mike Heath, who helped to steer London Transport Buses successfully into the private sector, has been awarded a MBE in the Queens Birthday Honours List. Mr. Heath, 46, a Manchester University graduate, said: "The award is a great honour. I regard it as a reflection of the team effort which went into a highly successful project."
<br>
<br>	Mr. Heath has worked for London Transport for 25 years. He was appointed Project Co-ordinator Bus Privatisation in September 1992.
After completing the pathfinder sales of London Coaches and Westlink, he managed the development of the contracting regime which underpinned the sales process and co-ordinated the teams of  in-house staff and advisers who prepared sales documents culminating in the highly successful sales of the companies.The sales realised proceeds of 233 million and were completed by the 31 December 1994 target date set by the Government.
<br>
<br>	For eight years before that he was Group Systems Manager and was instrumental in transferring the ticketing, computer systems and computer network into the private sector. Mr. Heath is now London Transports Project Manager for the Croydon Tramlink Project.  He took responsibility for the implementation of this 200 million PFI project in January 1995.	His present task is to ensure the successful management of the tender process and oversee LTs involvement in the subsequent stages of the project.

<IMG SRC="picc.gif" ALT="New Look Trains on the Piccadilly Line" WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="26">
<BR>[17 June 1996]
<BR>
<br>	The first of a fleet of trains refurbished to the highest possible standard was launched into passenger service today by Steven Norris MP, the Minister for Transport in London.
<br>	Arriving at Northfields Station on the revamped train, Mr Norris  said: "This is a train that is a pleasure to travel in, and shows that refurbishment represents excellent value for money.  The new interior design with its multi-functional areas for luggage and passengers is ideally suited to both commuters and passengers with heavy luggage travelling to Heathrow."
<BR>
<br>	The 87 trains will have a new seating layout allowing space for more passengers, emergency alarms which allow passengers to talk to the driver, interior dot-matrix information displays and full forced air ventilation.  The cost of the refurbishment will be 80 million.
<br>
<br>	Bob Bayman, the Piccadilly Line General Manager, is delighted with the trains: "They are hardly recognisable in their present form and I understand why some people refer to them as new trains even though they have been in service for 20 years.  As more are delivered, combined with the timetable improvements in late summer, travelling on the Piccadilly Line will set new standards of comfort and convenience for all."
<BR>
<br>	The refurbishment is being carried out on behalf of London Underground by Bombardier Eurorail at Wakefield in Yorkshire.  The design is by Warwick Design Consultancy Ltd.
<br>Feature of the new trains:
<br><ul>
<br><LI>Large standbacks are available just inside  the double doorways giving increased room for luggage or standing passengers.
<br>
<br><LI>All cross seats have been replaced by longitudinal ones, which reduces seating by six but increases standing capacity by twenty per car.
<br>
<br><LI>A number of perch seats have been installed at the end of the cars and in the luggage areas to compensate for the re-arranged conventional seating.
<br>
<br><LI>Emergency alarms have been fitted which allow customers to talk to the driver.
<br>
<br><LI>Interior visual displays give information which will provide information about stations and routes.
<br>
<br><LI>The internal loudspeaker system has been greatly improved.
<br>
<br><LI>Full forced-air ventilation will provide comfort on the hottest of days.
<br>
<br><LI>Drivers have been provided with greatly improved cabs, which can be sealed to reduce noise level and have advanced air cooling.
<br>
<br><LI>New impact resistant windscreens have been fitted to give protection to drivers.
<br>
<br><LI>New built-in detrainment steps are built into the end doors, to allow safe evacuation in case of emergencies.

<IMG SRC="hitech.gif" ALT="Hi Tech London Transport Ticket Machines for Newsagents" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="52">

<br>
<br>
<br>	A hi tech ticket machine that will speed up the sale of Travelcards and bus passes at London newsagents was unveiled today.  ICL and London Transport launched the new EPOS (Electronic Point Of Sale) machine                                                                                  in a ceremony in Hammersmith.
<br>
<br>	Neil and Tina Unlakat of Goodnews newsagent at 158 Hammersmith Road said: " We are delighted with our EPOS touchscreen ticket issuing machine.  It prints the details straight onto Travelcards and bus passes so customers are served more quickly, and weve been able to throw our rubber stamps and ink pads away.  We now hold far less stock, accounts are dealt with automatically so there is very little paperwork, and less likelihood of mistakes."
<br>
<br>	Norman Cohen, London Transports Marketing Director shook hands with Tim Gibson, Director of ICL Enterprises over the first machine in the Travel Information Centre at Hammersmith Bus Station.  ICL has won the contract to produce 1,700 machines for PASS agents throughout London.
<br>
<br>	Norman Cohen said: "This equipment will bring a major improvement for our customers in London, and provide our Agents with a more effective means of managing ticket issuing.  Were delighted with this innovation."
<br>
<br>	The machines in these two outlets in Hammersmith are among the first of the 1,700 to be installed in newsagents throughout London.  The majority will be installed during October and November.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>CONSTITUTION</B></font>
<BR>London Regional Transport (LRT) came into being - technically as a statutory corporation, but more commonly described as a nationalised industry - on 29th June 1984.  On that date, the London Regional Transport Act 1984 transferred political and financial control of what is generally known as London Transport (LT) from the Greater London Council (GLC) back to central government (which had last been directly responsible for LT in 1969).
<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>DUTY</B></font>
<BR>London Transport's principal duty is to provide, or secure, passenger transport services in Greater London, having regard for the transport needs of London and for efficiency, economy and safety of operation.
<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>LONDON TRANSPORT'S MANAGEMENT</B></font>
<BR>The Board of London Transport is headed by a Chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport.  Peter Ford took over as Chairman in September 1994 and additionally became Chairman of LTs subsidiary, London Underground, and of London Transport Buses.  There are currently three other full-time LT Board Members, one responsible for finance, one who is also Managing Director of London Underground and one who is also Managing Director of London Transport Buses.
<BR>Additional part-time Members, including a non-executive Vice Chairman, bring a wide range of outside business experience to the LT Board.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>ORGANISATION</B></font>
<BR>London Transport is a parent (or holding) corporation, with two wholly-owned subsidiary operating companies:

<UL>

<BR><LI>London Underground Limited (LUL)
<BR>LUL is responsible for the operation of the London Underground; and
<BR>
<BR><LI>Victoria Coach Station Limited (VCS)
<BR>Victoria Coach Station is the principal London terminal for national and international express coach services, serving over 1 000 destinations in 30 countries with some 170 000 departures each year.
<BR>
<BR>(Note: VCS administers the Coach Station, but is not responsible for the operation of the coach services using it.)
</UL>


<BR>A third operating subsidiary, London Buses Limited (LBL), effectively ceased to trade when its ten component companies were sold into the private sector by the end of 1994.  LBL had been set up in 1985 to operate London Transports bus services, and had in turn set up locally-based subsidiary companies in anticipation of the deregulation of bus services in London (although the Government announced in November 1993 that deregulation would not be implemented before the next General Election).
<BR>
<BR>LT began competitive tendering of its bus routes in 1985, and in 1993 those LBL routes not yet involved in the tendering process were also placed on a contractual basis.  This development, together with the sale of the LBL subsidiary companies in 1994, placed these companies on a similar basis to that of the private companies which are also operating bus services on behalf of, and under contract to, London Transport.  Overall responsibility for all bus services in London is now exercised by London Transport Buses, a department of LT but with its own Chairman, Managing Director and management board.
<BR>
<BR>Until 1992, there were two other subsidiary LT companies: a consultancy company, London Transport International (LTI), which ceased trading that year when LT decided to concentrate on its core operations; and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which was opened by LT in 1987 but transferred in 1992, as directed by the Government, to the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC).  The DLR remains an integral part of the London Transport zonally-based fares system.
<BR>
<BR>London Transport Advertising, responsible principally for selling poster spaces on buses and on Underground trains and stations, was also briefly an LT subsidiary company pending its sale, in August 1994, into the private sector.  Many other sections of London Transport function as separate professional or marketing divisions.  One such division is PASS (Pass Agents Sales Service) which is responsible for marketing LT Bus Passes and Travelcards through local newsagents and other sales outlets.
<BR>
<BR>The London Transport Museum in Covent Garden Piazza tells the ongoing story of public transport in London, with displays on the history of, current operations on and future plans for London Transport.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>FINANCE</B></font>
<BR>London Transport is required to ensure that its total income (including grants which the 1984 Act allows the Secretary of State for Transport to make for new capital investment and renewals, to help - if needed - cover operating costs and for funding the Dial-a-Ride minibus services) is sufficient to meet all its planned expenditure, taking one accounting year with another.
<BR>
<BR>In 1995/96, LT made an operating profit (before depreciation and renewals and grants) of 130 million, compared with 40 million the previous year.
<BR>
<BR>It is planned during the current 1996/97 financial year that London Transport's income from fares and other sources will be 1 160 million, and that a further 402 million will be received in the form of Government grant for investment expenditure.  In addition, the Government is to provide 569 million specifically for the construction of new rail lines.  As in the previous year, no grant will be provided in 1995/96 in support of LT operations.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>ACCOUNTABILITY</B></font>
<BR>The London Regional Transport Act 1984 set up the London Regional Passengers Committee (LRPC) to represent London Transport passengers and those travelling on other rail services in Greater London.
<BR>Public accountability is further achieved by the obligation on London Transport to:
<BR><UL>
<LI> publish each year an Annual Business Plan for the year ahead
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>publish an Annual Report at the end of each accounting year
<BR>
<BR><LI>inform local authorities and the London Regional Passengers Committee (LRPC) of the general level of services to be provided each year; the general route structure; and the level and structure of fares
<BR>
<BR><LI>consult with local authorities, the LRPC and other interested parties over proposed changes to services, including the introduction of new bus routes and the withdrawal of existing services
<BR>
<BR>
and
<BR>
<BR><LI>prepare at intervals a policy statement on which other railway operators
in London, the LRPC and local authorities must be consulted.  A fourth 	three-year Statement of Strategy, covering the years 1994 to 1997,was published in June 1994 after full consultation establishing
the overall framework within which London Transport's plans are determined.
</UL>

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES</B></font>
<BR>The 1994/97 LT Statement of Strategy identified the following priorities:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>	to provide or secure public transport in London to meet travel needs, and support Government planning policy guidelines
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to continue to press the case for adequate and stable funding, and where appropriate to seek additional resources, particularly from the private sector, to supplement Government grants
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to ensure the continuation of improvements to safety by setting rigorous safety standards and by the application of sensitive investment procedures and working practices for all services provided, or procured, by London Transport
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to secure increased income from fares by positive marketing and modest real fares increases, and to maintain the benefits of Travelcards to passengers while developing new tickets to meet market needs and to ensure ease of purchase
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to continue to improve Underground reliability and service quality, and to work towards achieving a Modern Underground for London early in the next century.  In the short to medium term, priority will be given to maintaining the basic infrastructure of the Underground particularly to improve service reliability
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to continue to plan Londons long-term transport needs particularly with regard to the planning, promotion and construction of new rail lines, the extension of existing lines and light rail schemes
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to enable the bus to play its full rle in meeting Londons transport needs by planning and procuring a high quality comprehensive network of bus services, and by providing reliable passenger information and 	attractive passenger facilities and to minimise the cost through competitive tendering of services
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to seek improved priority for buses on Londons roads, in particular by working with the highway authorities to implement the London Bus Priority Network and the Priority (Red) Route Network
<BR>
<BR><LI>	to contain its own costs and use resources in an efficient and effective manner, for example by promoting competition between bus operators through the agreed programme of bus route tendering and by adopting value-for-money procurement practices and more flexible working arrangements on London Underground
<BR>
<BR>	and
<BR>
<BR><LI> to work with the private bus operators and the rail operators and authorities to ensure that a comprehensive and co-ordinated public transport system is maintained in London including integrated services, ticketing and 	information following the privatisation of the London Transport bus subsidiaries and the franchising of the British Rail Train Operating Companies.
</UL>


<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>FARES POLICY</B></font>
<BR>A Fares Policy Statement was published in December 1991, in which LT indicated that it would seek to set its charges in the years ahead to reflect the operational and capital costs of travel but at a level which passengers can accept as fair and reasonable.  Overall, LT believes that there is a strong case for somewhat higher fares than those currently being charged.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>CO-ORDINATION</B></font>
<BR>London Transport is required by the 1984 Act to co-operate closely with other rail operators in the provision of public transport in London.  The popular zonally-based Travelcard, which offers unlimited travel on LT bus and rail services, was extended (as the Capitalcard) to the British Rail (BR) services within Greater London in 1985.  Since January 1989, these two tickets have been merged under the Travelcard name, offering all purchasers the freedom of travel on the buses, the Underground, the Docklands Light Railway and other rail services within the zones and for the period selected.  Many other ways of improving co-ordination are pursued through a top-level LT/BR Liaison Group.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>SERVICES FOR DISABLED PASSENGERS</B></font>
<BR>London Transport's Unit for Disabled Passengers is promoting a number of initiatives to make the bus and Underground networks more accessible to people with disabilities, including supplementary specialised services such as the wheelchair-accessible central London Stationlink bus route, and the Mobility Bus routes in the suburbs. Click Here To Learn More.

<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B>SCALE OF OPERATION</B></font>
<BR>The scale of London Transport's bus and Underground networks is vast.  Some 470 Underground trains serve 267 stations and 408 km (254 miles) of route, carrying 2.5 million passengers every working weekday.  Some 5 000 buses on 700 routes carry 3.7 million passengers a day.

<BR>London's dependence on its public transport system is well illustrated by just one simple statistic.  In 1994/95, almost a million people travelled into central London each working weekday between 0700 and 1000.  Well over four out of every five of these commuters used public transport:

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR><p>LONDON TRANSPORT'S STATUTORY DUTY</B></font>
<BR>Under the London Regional Transport Act 1984, London Transport (LT) is required to ensure that its total income (including grants) is sufficient to meet all its expenses, taking one accounting year with another.  The Act empowers the Secretary of State for Transport to make grants for capital investment and to help cover operating costs.  London Transport's statutory duties are supplemented by safety and business objectives, including financial and service quality targets, which are agreed from time to time with the Secretary of State.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR><p>REVENUE AND CAPITAL BUDGETS</B></font>
<BR>To assist in achieving its financial duties, London Transport prepares revenue and capital budgets which are submitted to the Secretary of State before the start of each financial year.
<BR>The revenue budget specifies targets for the total levels of bus and Underground services, income, costs and - until the financial year 1993/94 - the amount of any support grant LT required for its operations.  Since 1994/95 LT has not needed a revenue support grant, as it is being increasingly successful in generating its own sources of revenue from improved trading performance.
<BR>The capital budget covers investment in new or extended railway lines, in replacement railway rolling stock, and in bus and rail equipment and infrastructure.

<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR><p>GOVERNMENT GRANTS</B></font>
<BR>Until 1989/90, Government grant to London Transport included a two-thirds contribution raised from Greater London ratepayers.  Under the revised system of local government finance introduced in 1990/91, the total grant paid to LT now comes from central Government.  The LT Annual Business Plan for 1996/97 shows that in the current financial year Government grant of 983 million is contributing:
<BR><ul>
<BR><LI>402 million towards the 546 million
<BR>		core business capital investment programme;
<BR>
<BR><LI>569 million for major extensions and new lines,
<BR>		mainly the Jubilee Line Extension;
<BR>
<BR>	and
<BR>
<BR><LI>12 million for Dial-a-Ride services.
</UL>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR><p>PLANNED GOVERNMENT FINANCING FOR LT, 1996/97 - 1998/99</B></font>
<BR>In its 1995 Autumn Statement, the Government indicated that the finance available for London Transport in the next three financial years would be 953 million in 1996/97, 660 million in 1997/98 and 440 million in 1998/99.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR><p>THE GOVERNMENT'S PRIVATE FINANCE INITIATIVE (PFI)</B></font>
<BR>The Private Funding Initiative changes the way London Transport funds some of its investment programme.  Instead of using Government grant to fund the construction or purchase of an asset, the PFI enables LT to purchase services and the use of assets from the private sector, paying for them from its revenue budget.  The new trains on order for the Northern Line are being provided under the PFI, involving a contract for the supply and maintenance of the trains and the transfer of certain London Underground staff and depts to the supplier to carry out this work.
<BR>The PFI process means that the grant which might otherwise have been needed to fund this investment can be used on other major projects, thereby accelerating the investment programme.
<BR>Attached to this Fact Sheet are two Appendices:
<BR>Appendix A	summarises the financial performance of London Transport and its subsidiaries in 1994/95 (as published in the London Transport Annual Report for that year).
<BR>Appendix B	compares key financial statistics for the four years from 1991/92 to 1994/95 with the performance forecast for the current financial year in the London Transport Annual Business Plan for 1996/97.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR><BR>THE COMPANY STRUCTURE</B></font>
<BR>London Transport, (known legally as London Regional Transport, and established by the London Regional Transport Act 1984) is a statutory corporation which since its inception has set up a number of wholly-owned subsidiary companies.  These are currently:
<BR>
<BR>			London Underground Limited 	(LUL)
<BR>
<BR>			Victoria Coach Station Limited	(VCS)
<BR>
<BR>A third operating subsidiary, London Buses Limited (LBL), effectively ceased to trade when its ten component companies were sold into the private sector in 1994.  LBL had been set up in 1985 to operate London Transports bus services, and had in turn set up locally-based subsidiary companies in anticipation of the deregulation of bus services in London (although the Government announced in November 1993 that deregulation would not be implemented before the next General Election).  Overall responsibility for all bus services in London is now exercised by London Transport Buses, a department of LT but with its own Chairman, Managing Director and management board.
<BR>
<BR>Until 1992, there were two other subsidiary LT companies: a consultancy company, London Transport International (LTI), which ceased trading that year when LT decided to concentrate on its core operations; and the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which was opened by LT in 1987 but transferred in 1992, as directed by the Government, to the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC).  The DLR remains an integral part of the London Transport zonally-based fares system.  London Transport Advertising, responsible principally for selling poster spaces on buses and on Underground trains and stations, was also briefly an LT subsidiary company pending its sale, in August 1994, into the private sector.
<BR>
<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>LONDON TRANSPORT'S MANAGEMENT</B></font>
<BR>The Board of London Transport is headed by a Chairman appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport.  Peter Ford took over as Chairman in September 1994 and additionally became Chairman both of LTs subsidiary, London Underground, and of London Transport Buses.  There are currently three other full-time LT Board Members, one responsible for finance, one who is also Managing Director of London Underground and one who is also Managing Director of London Transport Buses.  Additional part-time Members, including a non-executive Vice Chairman, bring a wide range of outside business experience to the LT Board.

<BR>The rles of LT's subsidiary companies, and of the principal LT departments, are outlined in the next paragraphs.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B>SETTING THE SCENE</B></font>
<BR>Although public transport services in London have been operating for over 160 years, it is only comparatively recently that the basis for charging fares on London Transport has undergone a radical change.

<BR><BR>In place of the traditional British practice of relating the cost of a journey closely to the distance travelled, requiring a multiplicity of individual fares, London Transport's bus and Underground systems have since 1983 had a zonal fares structure, with multi-journey Travelcards offering both bus and rail travel.
<BR><BR>
Travelcards are valid on all modes of public transport in Greater London (with cheaper bus-only options).  For journeys on, or including travel on, British Rail services in Greater London, however, ordinary and day-return tickets can be charged both according to distance and to the time of day.
<BR><BR>
Two factors stimulated the development of Travelcards and Bus Passes.  In the first place, the need for faster access at stops to driver-only buses made the introduction of simplified fares and pre-paid multi-journey tickets desirable.  The availability of externally-funded revenue support at that time made it possible for LT to propose changing to a zonally-based system.
<BR><BR>
The crucial factor in securing universal public acceptance for this change was the simultaneous reduction in the cost of most journeys - at worst, some fares remained unchanged - thereby ensuring that no individual passenger was disadvantaged by the switch to the zonal fares structure.
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE TRAVELCARD</B></font>

<BR>Travelcards were launched in May 1983, since when the fares system has been based on concentric zones for Underground travel.  Until January 1989, the three outer of the five Travelcard zones were designated as a single zone for bus passengers (making three bus zones in total).
<BR><BR>In 1990, Zone 3 became a separate bus zone, but Zones 4 and 5 continued to be charged as one zone on the buses, making four bus zones in all.  In 1991, a new Zone 6 was introduced for rail travel in those areas of Greater London roundly five km (three miles) or more from the boundary of Zones 4 and 5.  This development did not affect bus travel, with existing Zones 4 and 5 and the new Zone 6 being designated as a single zone.
<BR>

<BR>The Travelcard has greatly simplified bus and rail travel in London.  The weekly version is priced broadly in relation to five return journeys by rail, and longer-validity Travelcards are issued at discounted rates for any period from one month to one year.  Regular passengers have been attracted by the benefits of a zonally-based ticket which, in addition to work journeys, also provides travel at other times at no extra cost.
<BR>
<BR>The full range of Travelcards, including Annual Travelcard Season Tickets (known as Gold Cards), may be purchased at London Underground stations and at British Rail stations in London.  Annual Bus Passes are also available from London Underground stations.
<BR><BR>One Day, Weekly and Monthly Bus Passes and Travelcards may be also purchased at PASS (Pass Agents Sales Service) outlets, a wide network of some 2 300 local newsagents and other shops which act as agents for London Transport, as well as at LT Travel Information Centres (and also at the bus garages in north and east London managed by Leaside Buses).
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RECENT FARES DEVELOPMENTS</B></font>
<BR>The principal initiative since the introduction of Travelcards was the Capitalcard, which from 1985 additionally gave holders access to British Rail's services in Greater London.

<BR><BR>The major feature of the 1989 fares revision was the merger of the Travelcard and the Capitalcard, under the Travelcard name.  Travelcard holders now have the freedom of bus, Underground, British Rail and Docklands Light Railway travel within the chosen zones of validity.
<BR>
<BR>LT is always looking at new ticketing initiatives to meet passengers' requirements, as well as using the pricing mechanism to encourage the purchase in advance of multi-journey travel.  Recent developments include an extended range of Bus Passes at cheaper rates than Travelcards for those passengers not requiring rail travel.
<BR><BR>The demand from part-time workers - who perceive no benefit from acquiring a weekly ticket - for an all-day One-Day ticket on LT services was met by the introduction in May 1991 of the LT Card.
<BR>
<BR>The leisure market has not been overlooked, with a wide range of off-peak one-day tickets at attractive prices.  One-Day Travelcards are not valid for travel in the morning peak period on Mondays to Fridays, nor can they or LT Cards or One-Day Bus Passes be used on the AIRBUS routes to and from Heathrow or on the Night Buses, where special fares are charged.

<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LOOKING AHEAD</B></font>
<BR>London Transport has adjusted its fares each year (usually in January), with increases up to 1987 broadly in line with the prevailing rate of inflation.
<BR><BR>Since 1988,fares levels have generally been increased by more than the Retail Price Index.  In January 1996, the overall change is roundly 4.5%.
<BR>
<BR>London Transport published a Fares Policy Statement in December 1991 which indicated its intention to set charges in the years ahead to reflect the operational and capital costs of travel but at a level which passengers could regard as fair and reasonable.  Overall, LT believes that there is a strong case for somewhat higher fares in real terms than those currently being charged.
<BR>
<BR>In 1996, LT is introducing a package of new discount tickets as part of an aggressive marketing campaign to attract people out of their cars and on to public transport.  A book ("carnet") of ten Zone 1 tickets will be available from March 1996 for 10.00 - a 10% discount.
<BR><BR>From Easter 1996, a Family Travelcard will offer a minimum of one adult and one child and a maximum of two adults and four children the opportunity to purchase One Day Travelcards at a 20% adult discount and a nominal 50p for the Child tickets.  Also from Easter 1996, a Weekend Travelcard will be available for travel on Saturdays and Sundays at a 25% discount on the price of two One Day Travelcards.
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SMARTCARD</B></font>
<BR>The way ahead for tickets on the buses may well be the contactless electronic Smartcard.  This ticket, which is similar to a credit card, does not need to be fed through a machine or shown to the driver, but merely has to be passed close to a transmitter fitted near the entrance to the bus next to the conventional ticket-issuing machine.
<BR><BR>A micro chip implanted inside the Smartcard is activated into conveying information by a radio link to this transmitter, thereby indicating that the ticket is valid.  The cost of the passengers journey is debited simultaneously.  If the ticket is not valid - for example if there is insufficient value left to meet the cost of the journey - the driver is alerted.
<BR>
<BR>A local trial, involving a date-limited multi-journey ticket such as a Bus Pass supported by a smart photocard, commenced in the Harrow area in February 1994, involving almost 200 buses on 19 routes.  This experiment was the widest application yet seen of this technology on buses.
<BR>
<BR>A stored value Smartcard, known as a Farecard, and similar to a Phonecard except that it is rechargable, was tested out in the second stage of the Harrow experiment.  In this stored value guise, a Farecard can be kept indefinitely by being topped up whenever its value runs low.  The Farecard cost 10.00, but could be recharged with 6.00 worth of bus travel for only 5.00.
<BR><BR>Another benefit of the Farecard is that there is no wasted value, as can happen with a time-limited ticket like a Bus Pass, making it attractive to irregular users.
<BR>
<BR>For bus passengers, Smartcard offers greater convenience, especially for those with disabilities or travelling with luggage or young children; discounts for Farecard users; and immediate cancellation in the case of lost tickets.

<BR><BR>For bus operators, the potential benefits of the Smartcard are better information about individual journeys which will help in service planning; a reduction in fraudulent travel; faster boarding times because of the speed of card verification; and more precise apportionment of revenue from multi-journey tickets to the individual companies.
<BR>
<BR>The next stage will be an investigation how to extend this technology to the rest of the LT bus system and to the London Underground and even to other rail operators in London.  As an initial development, LT has advertised in the European Journal for private sector partners to plan and implement a network-wide system based on Smartcards.
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CONCESSIONARY FARES</B></font>
<BR>Children under the age of five (on the buses, a maximum of two accompanying a fare-paying passenger) are carried free.  Generally there are cheaper fares for those aged five to 15 except - on the buses - before 09.30 on Mondays to Fridays and after 22.00 daily. (These time restrictions do not apply to holders of weekly or longer period Bus Passes and Travelcards.)  14 and 15 year olds need to have a photocard to qualify for cheaper fares.

<BR>
<BR>The London Boroughs arrange (and pay for) free travel by elderly and disabled residents of Greater London.  The only restriction (which does not apply to holders of a Registered Blind Persons' Card) on the use of these concessionary permits is before 09.00 on Mondays to Fridays.
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FRAUDULENT TRAVEL</B></font>
<BR>LT has estimated that as much as 40 million could be lost each year because of passengers who either pay no fare or who contrive to pay less than the proper fare.  LT's particular concern at these losses arises from the penalty they impose on the honest majority of passengers who consequently pay higher fares than they need.

<BR><BR>Photocards were progressively introduced between 1978 and 1983 to help combat fraudulent use of weekly or longer period Travelcards, Bus Passes and concessionary permits.
<BR>
<BR>A highly successful development in the campaign to contain the level of fraudulent travel has been the introduction at all Underground stations of automatic ticket-issuing machines which give change, and the installation of automatic ticket checking and validating gates at central London stations.

<BR><BR>The 80 per cent of Underground passengers whose journeys start and/or finish in the central area (Zone 1) now have their tickets read and marked electronically to prevent any subsequent misuse.  These gates are now additionally being introduced at some suburban Underground stations.
<BR>
<BR>Like their colleagues on Underground trains, inspectors on the buses are able - through hand-held computers - to detect tickets which they suspect are being misused.  Since April 1994, passengers on the London Underground not possessing a valid ticket have been liable for a 10 Penalty Fare.
<BR><BR>At the same time, routine ticket checking at Underground stations outside the central area has been replaced by enhanced inspection on trains.  5 Penalty Fares were introduced on LT Buses in April 1995.
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FARES ON LT SERVICES OUTSIDE GREATER LONDON</B></font>
<BR>The zonal fares system covers Greater London only.  Fare scales on LT bus services in the counties around London are calculated on the basis of the distance travelled.  On the Underground, fares outside Greater London are determined by LT on a sectional basis, similar to the zonal structure within London.
<BR>
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS</B></font>
<BR>A study undertaken in 1995 by the London Research Centre in collaboration with London Transport established that, of 16 major cities around the world, London ranked 3rd for the overall cost of an average week's travel after New York and Dublin.  The cost ranged from 7.38 in New York to 1.85 in Athens, with London's travel costing 5.38.
<BR><BR>To eliminate differences in price levels in the cities examined, the survey was based on the Purchasing Power Parity concept which compares prices for a standard range of goods and services in the countries involved.

<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><BR>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Most famous buildings are identified either by their name, or by their occupants or purpose.  It is rare, if not unique, for a building to be known principally by its postal address.  55 Broadway is one such property.  Under its postal name, it is not only readily associated with London Transport but also enjoys a much wider architectural reputation.  Yet the actual building - because of its location - is, undeservedly, relatively unknown, even to Londoners.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>THE SITE</B></font>
<BR>The District Railway constructed London's second underground line in the late 1860s under the maze of Westminster's back streets between St James's Park and the then recently opened Victoria Street.  Both the new line and St James's Park station opened in 1868, and thirty years later the railway company transferred its offices from Victoria Street to new premises over the station.  As the District Railway Company and its successors expanded their control over public transport operations in London, the offices were rebuilt and extended.  But by the late 1920s, the Board of what had now become the Underground Group was anxious to house all its staff in one new purpose-built office block on the site.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>55 BROADWAY - THE DESIGN CONCEPT</B></font>
<BR>The Underground Group wanted its new headquarters to reflect its bold vision of the future for public transport in London.  In the 1920s, it was still considered radical for a company to occupy its own premises rather than to rent accommodation.  But the plans developed by Adams, Holden and Pearson, the architects commissioned by the Group, were even more radical:
<BR>
<UL>
<BR><LI> Broadway would be the tallest office building in London;
<BR>
<BR><LI>cruciform design - in place of the customary
hollow rectangle format - would offer staff
more natural daylight in wings projecting from a central core housing lifts, staircases and essential services;
<BR><BR>and
<BR>
<BR><LI>contemporary artists would be invited to sculpt
decorative features directly onto the stone facade.
</UL>

<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>CHARLES HOLDEN</B></font>
<BR>The name of Charles Holden, one of the partners in the commissioned firm of architects, is always associated with 55 Broadway and with the Underground Group, for whom he undertook many other commissions notably new stations like that at Morden.  For 55 Broadway, Holden adopted an ingenious solution for a site made complex both by its irregular shape and by the railway only 7.3 metres (24 feet) below street level.  Holden provided a route for pedestrians through the ground floor of the offices and across the new station booking hall, thereby reducing the circuitous walk between Victoria Street and the Park.  This "short cut" became the principal axis of Holden's cruciform design, although the purely cross-shaped layout for office accommodation was only adopted from the second floor upwards.  On the ground and first floors, the "hypotenuse" of three of the triangles between the wings was additionally used as working or commercial space.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>FEATURES OF THE CONSTRUCTION</B></font>
<BR>55 Broadway was constructed between 1927 and 1929.  The building is supported by 700 reinforced concrete piles sunk to an average depth of 12.2 metres (40 feet) below basement level.  Nineteen massive load-bearing steel girders span the railway, and special insulation was used to reduce vibration from the trains.  Above ground, the building was constructed around a steel girder skeleton and faced with 2 200 cubic metres (78 000 cubic feet) of high quality Portland stone.
<BR>The faades were embellished with decorative features, carved in situ.  Two are just above street level and a further eight are above the sixth floor windows on each side of all four wings.  The sculptors were:
<BR>
<BR>	At street level	-	Jacob Epstein (2)
<BR>
<BR>	At sixth floor level	-	Eric Gill (3); Henry Moore; A H Garrard;
<BR>					Eric Aumonier; Allan Wyon; F Rabinovitch
<BR>
<BR>A free illustrated leaflet providing more detailed information about these sculptures is available from the Corporate Relations Office, London Transport, 55 Broadway, London  SW1H OBD.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>55 BROADWAY TODAY</B></font>
<BR>The bold appearance of the building is enhanced by progressive stepping back, and the central tower echoes this uneven pyramid effect.  Now over 60 years old, 55 Broadway has been refurbished, with a new street-level shopping mall allowing the reopening of the eastern entrance to the building.  The faade, the main staircase, the lift lobby areas on each floor and the panelled wing including the office of Lord Ashfield (the first Chairman of London  Transport), have all been "listed".

<BR>London Transport's relationship with the London Regional Passengers' Committee (LRPC)
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>THE CONSTITUTION OF THE LRPC</B></font>

<BR>The London Regional Passengers' Committee (LRPC) is an independent statutory body established under the London Regional Transport Act, 1984.  The LRPC represents the interests of the users of bus and rail services in London.  Its rail remit covers the London Underground, the train and station operating companies responsible for London's suburban rail services, Railtrack and Eurostar operations in and around London.  This remit has recently been extended by provisions in the Channel Tunnel Act, the Heathrow Express Railway Act and the Croydon Tramway Act.  Following the change of ownership of the Docklands Light Railway in 1992 from London Transport to the London Docklands Development Corporation, the Corporation has voluntarily permitted the Committee to represent the users of that railway.
<BR>
<BR>The Chairman of the Committee and its members (who may number up to 30) are appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport.  The Committee's members come from a variety of backgrounds, including transport users groups, industry and commerce, together with those who are able to speak for the needs of people with disabilities and members who can represent ethnic minorities.  The Committee is supported by a full-time secretariat.
<BR>
<BR>The full Committee and sub-Committees meet in public, usually six times a year.  There are two sub-Committees, one dealing with Service Development and one with Service Quality.  There are also two Working Parties which meet as necessary dealing with airport access and with disabled passengers issues.
<BR>
<P><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>THE RLE OF THE LRPC</B></font>
<BR>The Committee is required to consider representations about any matters relating to bus and rail services in and around London.  It makes recommendations, as appropriate, to London Transport, the Rail Regulator, Railtrack, the operators, the Government and the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee.  The LRPC has a further duty to consider objections received to any proposal to withdraw totally passenger services from any rail station or section of line, and to report to the Secretary of State for Transport on any hardship which would result from implementing the closure proposal.

<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P><BR>LONDON TRANSPORT'S LIAISON WITH THE COMMITTEE</B></font>
<BR>London Transport's contacts with the LRPC are focused on the Consultation and  Liaison Unit within the Marketing Department.  The Unit also co-ordinates London Transport's contacts with the individual London Boroughs and their representative association, the Association of London Government (ALG).
<BR>
<BR>London Transport is required by law to consult the LRPC over proposed changes to bus services, fares levels and over the preparation of its three-yearly Statements of Strategy.  In practice, however, the Committee is consulted by LT on the broad range of its policies and issues, including all significant service changes (bus and rail), station modernisation schemes, new vehicle designs, etc.  Initial discussion of these topics usually takes place at an LRPC sub-Committee meeting, where LT's Liaison Officers are often supported by appropriate managers who attend to give an introductory presentation and to answer LRPC members' questions.
<BR>
<BR>In addition to those matters on which London Transport consults the LRPC, the Committee will raise for comment or explanation issues in which it has itself instigated an interest.  The Committee will also pursue matters on behalf of individual passengers, although usually only after the operator has first been given the chance to investigate and reply direct.  The LRPC may then ask for further review or action if the passenger remains dissatisfied.
<BR>
<BR>London Transport actively seeks, and welcomes, the LRPC's input into its decision-making processes.  Many proposals are modified to reflect the Committee's constructive comments, and LT has particularly appreciated the LRPC's forceful support of the public transport cause with other organisations, including its advocacy of greater levels of investment in the Underground system and more bus priority measures.
<BR>
<P>The LRPC may be contacted at
<BR>	Clements House

<BR>	London  EC2V 7PR

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>In 1933, all London's road and Underground railway passenger services were brought under the control of a single authority for the first time.  One of London Transport's first decisions was to set up the Lost Property Office to provide a centralised location for articles left on its buses and trains, or at Underground stations.  Before 1933, the Police had been responsible for looking after property left on buses and coaches, and the Underground railways had maintained their own, separate, system.
<BR>
<BR>Prior to 1970, when the area covered by LT's networks was significantly reduced, as many as 400 000 articles a year passed through the Lost Property Office (which is located at 200 Baker Street, London  NW1 5RZ).  Today, a staff of 25 administers the Office, which handled some 108,000 items and dealt with 72 000 personal and written enquiries in 1994/95.  About a third of all items were returned to their owners, with some 60 per cent of articles of value - including money - reclaimed.  Put into perspective, the total number of journeys made on the network in 1994/95 was 1 923 million (1 159 million on the buses and 764 million on the Underground), indicating that passengers mislay one item for every 17.8 million journeys.
<BR>

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RECLAIMING LOST PROPERTY</B></font>
<BR>Three working days need to be allowed before visiting the Lost Property Office, which is open to personal callers between 09.30 and 14.00 on Mondays to Fridays.  Alternatively, enquiries can be made by completing a special enquiry form available at Underground stations, or by post.  A recorded telephone message, on 0171-486 2496, explains the procedure.  Because of the time-consuming nature of calls, the Lost Property Office cannot handle individual enquiries by telephone.
<BR>
<BR>The administrative charges for the recovery of items of lost property are set by LT under powers laid down by the London Transport Act 1982.  The charge per item is 2.00, but if passengers are able to reclaim their mislaid property locally at a bus garage or an Underground station before the article is sent on to Baker Street, the charge is reduced by half.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>UNCLAIMED PROPERTY</B></font>
<BR>In 1994/1995, income from these charges amounted to 39 000. Articles unclaimed after a minimum of three months are sent for sale at public auction.  These sales, held approximately ten times a year at R F Greasby's in Tooting, south London (for details, telephone 0181-672 1100), raised an additional 52 000 in 1994/1995.  Unclaimed money amounted to a further 50 000.  All these sources of direct lost property revenue fell short of meeting the total cost of operating the service; the balance comes from general LT funds.  A proportion of the gross receipts is allocated to staff funds in lieu of individual rewards to staff for handing in items of lost property.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Property is an important asset of the London Transport group, and the rle of LT Property (LTP) is to identify opportunities for generating income from property and property-related activities, and to maximise the revenue raised.  In addition LTP provides a full service to ensure the efficient use of property assets for the public transport business.
<BR> The main functions of LTP are:
<UL>
<BR><LI>the management and improvement of
the groups commercial portfolio;
<BR>
<BR><LI>the creation and implementation of sale
and development opportunities;
<BR>
<BR><LI>the acquisition of land required for new lines
and projects;
<BR>
<BR><LI>advice on land use and town planning matters;
<BR>
<BR>
and
<BR>
<BR><LI>the provision or procurement for the LT group of the full range of professional property services required for its operations.
<BR>
</ul>
<BR>LT Property fulfils these functions by using a small core team of specialist professional staff, supplemented as necessary by external consultants.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>ORGANISATION</B></font>
<BR>LT Property is responsible to the LT Property Board, which is chaired by the Chairman of London Transport, Peter Ford. The executive management team is lead ly Colin Smith.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FINANCE</B></font>
<BR>Gross sales revenue for all activities in the financial year which ended in March 1995 amounted to some 70 million.  The net receipts of over 50 million are available to London Transport for improving London's public transport system.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CORE BUSINESS SUPPORT</B></font>
<BR>London Transport Property provides policy guidance on the proper asset management of the LT Group's extensive land holdings, together with property service support for all projects.  LTP is heavily involved in major projects such as the Jubilee Line Extension, CrossRail, Croydon Tramlink and the Northern Line modernisation.

<BR>
<BR>At the planning stage LTP advises on the property implications of a project, produces land cost estimates, advises on town planning and rating issues and exploits any development opportunities created.  LTP subsequently acquires any land needed by compulsory purchase or agreement, and undertakes the necessary rating, town planning and other property work involved.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND SALES PROGRAMME</B></font>
<BR>A major sales campaign is underway in respect of surplus bus garages released from operational use prior to the privatisation of the London Buses subsidiary companies.  This has produced 25 million to date and is expected to bring in a further 20 million in the next 18 months.
<BR>
<BR>In addition to the sale of surplus operational property, LTP aims to identify and exploit development opportunities on, over and beside operational land and buildings.  Development projects produce capital and revenue income, but additionally can offer passenger benefits in the form of new Underground and bus station facilities.  The 41 800 square metre (450 000 square feet) Broadway Centre development at Hammersmith is fully let, and provides major new transport interchange facilities with a new bus station and Underground station ticket hall.
<BR>
<BR>A major deal has been completed for the development of surplus land above the Central Line dept at White City for a regional shopping centre of some 65 000 square metres (700 000 square feet).  The development will provide LT with capital and revenue income, a new bus station and improvements to the railway dept.
<BR>
<BR>Comprehensive property development schemes are proposed for the stations at Victoria, South Kensington and at Edgware Road Circle, District and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines station, which will generate both substantial passenger benefits and new income.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PROPERTY MANAGEMENT</B></font>
<BR>Revenue in 1994/95 from shop rentals at Underground stations and other commercially-let premises amounted to over 31 million, reflecting the results of active management in a dull market.  A programme for refurbishing shops, kiosks and arches is underway on the Underground, incorporating new environmental designs and safety standards.  New sources of income are under continual investigation to ensure that revenue returns are maximised.
<BR>
<BR>LT Property also has responsibility for commercial income from other sources at stations and group-owned sites including vending machines, telephones, self-service cash machines and poster advertising at sites other than stations.  These facilities currently produce income of over 7 million a year.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>London Transport's Unit for Disabled Passengers was set up in 1984 to act as a focal point for coordinating initiatives aimed at making public transport in London more accessible to people with disabilities.  This has involved working with engineers and designers to make buses and trains easier to use; with architects to improve facilities at Underground and bus stations as they are modernised; and with managers and staff of the bus and rail operating businesses to ensure that appropriate training is given on how to offer help to disabled and elderly passengers.
<BR>
<BR>The Unit keeps itself abreast of improvements elsewhere to transport facilities for disabled, mobility-impaired and elderly people, and is in regular contact with the many organisations which represent people with disabilities.  It also produces an expanding range of large-print maps and leaflets, videos and cassette tapes specifically to cater for their needs (details from 0171-918 3312).
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INITIATIVES FOR PASSENGERS IN WHEELCHAIRS</B></font>
<BR>
<BR>London Transport Buses
<BR>The main double-deck AIRBUS services linking the terminals at Heathrow Airport with central London are operated with vehicles which have been adapted to carry two wheelchair-users, who board and alight by means of a special lift.  Similarly fitted midibuses provide the hourly "Stationlink" circular service around London's principal railway terminals.  In the suburbs, an expanding network of "Mobility Bus" services can convey up to five wheelchair-users on each journey.
<BR>
<BR>All these fully accessible services are operated with well-trained drivers who can assist as necessary.  The Unit has also overseen - in conjunction with London Transport Buses and the Department of Transport - the introduction of 68 fully-accessible low-floor buses on five busy suburban routes.  These buses have step-free doorways, giving direct access for wheelchair users, and can "kneel" at stops to help frail, elderly passengers and parents with young children in buggies.
<BR>
<BR>Wheelchair-users can also travel, by prior arrangement, on the Original Round London Sightseeing Tour operated by London Coaches Limited (telephone 0171-828 7495 for details.)
<BR>

<p>London Underground
<BR>The extension, now under construction, of the Jubilee Line from Green Park to Stratford through south-east London and Docklands has been designed to be a fully accessible railway from its planned opening in 1998.  In October 1993, restrictions on the use which wheelchair-bound passengers may make of the Underground, and in particular of the deep-level "tube" lines, were lifted.  It is also planned to develop a network of stations at which step-free access (including by lift) will be provided between the street, the ticket hall and the platforms.
<BR>
<BR>Dial-a-Ride
<BR>Over 200 wheelchair-accessible minibuses offer a pre-booked door-to-door service for disabled Londoners through six independent "Dial-a-Ride" companies funded - with a grant from central Government - by the Unit for Disabled Passengers.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OTHER SERVICES</B></font>
<BR>
<BR>Taxicard
<BR>The London Taxicard scheme, funded by the participating London Boroughs, provides subsidised door-to-door transport for disabled people who cannot use buses or trains.  This scheme is now administered by the London Accessible Transport Unit (for further details, telephone 0181-748 7272).
<BR>
<BR>Docklands Light Railway (DLR)
<BR>The DLR is fully accessible, with step-free access or lifts at all stations.  When all or part of the system is closed for engineering work, and a replacement bus service is provided, wheelchair-accessible transport is available at up to two hours' notice by telephoning the Docklands Travel Hotline on 0171-918 4000.  For general information about facilities on the DLR, telephone 0171-363 9700.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INITIATIVES FOR OTHER PASSENGERS WITH DISABILITIES</B></font>
<BR>There are some half a million Londoners with disabilities who are potentially able to use public transport, and special features have been introduced on vehicles and at stations to make their journeys easier.  These include:

<BR><ul>
<BR><LI>lower entrance and exit steps on buses;
<BR>
<BR><LI>brightly-coloured, non-slip, handrails and highlighted step edges
which contrast with their surroundings
to assist partially-sighted passengers;
<BR>
<BR><LI>"Stopping" signs on buses for people
with impaired hearing.  These signs illuminate
when the bell is rung by passengers wishing to alight;
<BR>
<BR><LI>new and refurbished trains and buses are fitted
with a beep warning that the doors are closing;
and automated digitised-speech announcements of bus stop
and station names, to assist visually-impaired passengers
in particular, are being tested;
<BR>
<BR><LI>microphone-linked induction loops at station booking office windows to help hearing-aid users travelling on the Underground;
<BR>
<BR>and
<BR>
<BR><LI>a "Minicom" system for telephone enquiries from deaf people
who have access to compatible equipment.
<BR><BR>
London Transport's 24-hour Travel Information Minicom
telephone number is 0171-918 3015.
<BR>
<BR>
The Unit for Disabled Pasengers may also be contacted by Minicom during office hours on 0171-918 3312.

<BR>Victoria Coach Station opened on its present site in 1932 replacing the coach terminal in Lupus Street, Pimlico, owned by London Coastal Coaches Limited, an association of coach operators.  With only a brief and enforced interruption during part of the Second World War, the company provided London terminal facilities for its shareholding operators and their passengers through the pre-war growth and post-war decline of the industry.  It financed itself through direct and agency ticket sales and with rents accruing from the large office block built over the passenger facilities in 1932 to make the site profitable.
<BR>
<BR>Amalgamations and grouping of the coach operators had placed most of the shares of the company in the hands of operators who were part of the country's two large bus groups, Tillings and BET.  The 1968 Transport Act established the National Bus Company (NBC) as a statutory company to bring together the bus and coach interests of both groups, and London Coastal Coaches became a subsidiary of the NBC.
<BR>
<BR>During the 1970s, Victoria Coach Station was the responsibility of the NBC subsidiary, National Travel (South East) Ltd.  At the end of 1978, the London Coastal Coaches company was brought back to life and renamed Victoria Coach Station, experience having shown the need for separate management.
<BR>
<BR>In 1988, following the break-up and sell-off of the NBC, Victoria Coach Station Limited was acquired by London Transport at the request of the Secretary of State for Transport.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>AIMS OF THE COMPANY</B></font>
<BR>The rle of the company is to provide an arrivals and departures facility for coaches in London, with off-street setting down and pick-up.  The provision of a safe, comfortable environment both for coach travellers and for those seeing off or welcoming passengers is of prime importance.  In fulfilling this rle, the company continues to aim to make a defined commercial profit unless it is directed to do otherwise in pursuance of Department of Transport policy, for example by making major building improvements.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE COMPANY'S ACTIVITIES</B></font>
<BR>The company's income is primarily derived from coach departures, arrivals and parking fees.  It also earns commission as an agent for National Express and other coach operators, as well as from holidays and rail, sea and air services not directly connected with the coach industry.  Its travel agency, VCS World Travel, also has a specialised business division which, against fierce competition, successfully organises the business travel requirements of many organisations in the public and private sectors, and of individuals prominent in public life, including Members of the European Parliament.  Other income is derived from rents, and fees from some passenger facilities contribute towards costs.
<BR>
<BR>Turnover from departure and parking fees and agency commission was 5.1 million in 1994/95.
<BR>
<BR>Victoria Coach Station occupies two sites, Victoria Coach Station and, on the opposite side of Elizabeth Street, Eccleston Garage, the latter being used principally for express services arrivals.  The Coach Station handles over 90 per cent of long-distance domestic coach travel and some ten million passengers annually pass through the Station, more than at three of Heathrow Airports four terminals.  Some 170 000 coach departures each year provide express services to over 1 000 destinations countrywide, throughout Europe and even into North Africa, as well as more local services in the Home Counties and to the airports around London.  The last three years have seen increases in the number of coach departures following eight years of decline.
<BR>
<BR>A significant proportion of the company's 130 staff work in direct contact with passengers, providing services such as timetable information, telephone ticket sales, over-the-counter ticket sales, assistance to elderly and disabled travellers, left luggage facilities, and a lost property office.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE REFURBISHMENT PROGRAMME</B></font>
<BR>Fitting all the services provided into the Company's 2.8 acre split site presents a constant challenge.  It became clear in recent years that modernisation and expansion of passenger facilities was essential.  However no major refurbishment work was possible during the extended privatisation process of the National Bus Company.
<BR>
<BR>The recently completed 4 million improvement programme has seen the introduction of airport-style departure lounges, modern visual display units (VDUs) transmitting service information, more seating in waiting areas and improved toilet facilities.  The design includes glazed screens to protect passengers from the noise and fumes of an operational coach station and to minimise safety hazards.  Clearer signs mean easy identification of coach departure bays, ticket offices and the many new catering and retail kiosks.
<BR>
<BR>Particular attention has been paid to improving toilet facilities, with cubicles being provided which are more convenient and accessible to passengers with heavy luggage or accompanied by small children.
<BR>
<BR>To provide the extra space needed for these improvements some reduction has been made to the number of coach spaces, but not at the expense of the station's ability to accommodate all its present customers and more.
<BR>
<BR>The departures area refurbishment programme was completed late in 1992, six months ahead of schedule, and subsequent market research has confirmed that the travelling public now judges coach station standards against those achieved at Victoria.  Refurbishment of the separate arrivals area was undertaken last winter at a cost of a third of a million pounds and the improved facilities were opened in April 1995.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CONSULTATION</B></font>
<BR>The improvement programme, and the station's day-to-day operations, are the subject of continuing consultation with local residents' groups, the London Regional Passengers' Committee and LT's Unit for Disabled Passengers.  Safety matters, which are vitally important in such a confined area, are the subject of continuous monitoring and review by management and staff, in close co-operation with LT's Safety Audit team.  A Customer Charter was introduced on completion of the refurbishment programme, and in October 1994 the company was awarded a Government Charter Mark for excellence in customer service.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Sale of multi-journey travel tickets to passengers through local outlets began in 1981, when London District Pass Distributors (LDPD) was set up jointly by London Transport and the London Council of the Federation of Retail Newsagents.  The business grew steadily throughout the 1980s, particularly after the introduction of the Travelcard in 1983.  Since London Transport took direct control of the company in 1990, turnover from the sale of these popular tickets has increased by about 85%.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE RLE OF PASS</B></font>
<BR>Now retitled Pass Agents Sales Service, and familiarly known as PASS, the company is expanding the business further to meet the needs of LT passengers.  Some 2 300 outlets in newsagents, convenience stores and sub Post Offices in high street and residential area locations across the whole of Greater London offer a unique facility for passengers to purchase tickets up to seven days in advance of the date of travel.  This is a popular alternative to buying tickets at the station or on a bus.
<BR>PASS agents account for nearly 100% of LT Bus Pass sales, as well as some 18% of LT Travelcard sales.  The annual turnover of the business is over 160 million, involving some 33 million tickets.
<BR>

<BR>The General Manager of PASS is Roger Harding, and the company may be contacted at

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>The London Transport Travel Information Service (TIS) provides passengers and potential passengers with impartial advice about every aspect of travelling around London - by bus, Underground, British Rail, or Docklands Light Railway - principally through the telephone enquiry bureau and the network of Travel Information Centres.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE RANGE OF ENQUIRIES</B></font>
<BR>The information provided by the TIS both to Londoners and to visitors includes times, fares and comprehensive journey planning on all the transport modes which make up London's complex and extensive network.  The TIS also deals with a wide range of general enquiries on such matters as the location of, and how to get to, individual places of interest and current information on how bus and train services are actually running.
<BR>
<BR>A sophisticated computer system (ROUTES) is being installed to improve the efficiency of the TIS, and to enhance its capacity to give impartial and effective multi-modal travel advice for any public transport journey being planned within Greater London.  The ROUTES system (on which a separate Fact Sheet is available from the LT Travel Information Service) will be fully operational in the spring of 1996.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HOW THE SERVICE IS DELIVERED</B></font>
<BR>Telephone travel enquiries are handled 24 hours a day on the well-known number, 0171-222 1234, with a separate special Docklands Travel Hotline on 0171-918 4000.
<BR>
<BR>London Travelcheck on 0171-222 1200, together with direct teletext broadcasts to BBC Ceefax (page 521) and to ITV Teletext on 3 (page 194), offer regularly updated real-time information on how bus and rail services in London are actually running.
<BR>
<BR>Similar information is co-ordinated for broadcasting on local radio stations.  There are also 13 Travel Information Centres (TICs - listed at the end of this Fact Sheet) at various central London and suburban locations and at Heathrow Airport.
<BR>
<BR>Most TICs are equipped with the TICTAC system which, through the medium of television screens, provides real-time travel details and information about the facilities available at the Centres.  A correspondence section handles written travel enquiries.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>MEETING THE CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS</B></font>
<BR>Over 2.5 million people telephone the TIS annually with requests for information, and this demand is increasing.  Demanding customer service targets are set for the telephone enquiry bureau which are measured against callers' perception of the service in terms of the speed, accuracy and helpfulness of response.
<BR>
<BR>Research has shown that over two-thirds of those who telephone the TIS actually make the journey about which they have enquired, and that 13% would not have travelled in the absence of the travel advice given by the TIS: the extra generated revenue covers the cost of providing the information four times over. Income from the Travel Information Centres exceeds 10 million annually, from ticket sales, other travel and tours tickets and from travel-related merchandise.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRAVEL INFORMATION SERVICE STAFF</B></font>
<BR>In order to perform the mainstream activities described in this Fact Sheet, the dedicated team of Travel Information staff receive extensive training to equip them for their rle.  They are also at times deployed to other locations to assist in promoting new London Transport services or facilities.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE TRAVEL INFORMATION CENTRES</B></font>
<BR>
The TICs are located at the following London Underground stations:

<br>
<br><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<br>London Transport has inherited from its predecessors an historical reputation for good design in every sphere of its activities.  This reputation finds expression in many ways, most notably the world-famous and instantly recognised circle and bar LT roundel, and the sans-serif Johnston typeface first introduced in 1916 and recently updated as New Johnston.
<BR>
<BR>However, the quality of LT design is also exemplified through the architecture of stations, particularly those of Charles Holden; through the design of buses and trains, which have always been models of their kind; and through publicity material, especially pictorial posters and the Underground map.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LTS DESIGN HERITAGE</B></font>
<br>London Transport has inherited a rich and diverse architectural and design heritage which it richly prizes.  In acknowledging this, great efforts are made to retain as much as is practicable within changing operational and safety requirements.  It is London Transports, and Londons, good fortune that many fine examples of its design heritage survive and are as fit for their purpose today as they were when first created.
<p><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE CONTRIBUTION OF FRANK PICK</B></font>
<br>Much of what has been regarded as the best design work was strongly influenced by Frank Pick.  Pick, who was Managing Director of the Underground Group before London Transport was formed in 1933 and subsequently LT Vice Chairman, is now recognised as one of the pioneers and champions of modern industrial design.  Pick's influence was felt on everything from buildings and their decorative features to the artistic form of the printed word.
<BR>
<br>Pick was very aware of both the importance of good visual communication and of the provision of clear information, as well as of just how such concerns could successfully influence perceptions and shape attitudes.  This led to the  commissioning of the Johnston typeface in 1916, and also of posters from early this century promoting travel on Londons buses, trams, coaches, trolleybuses and the Underground.  Many of these posters are recognised today as landmarks in corporate communications.

<br><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DESIGN IN LT SINCE 1933</B></font>
<br>The major design initiative of the early 1930s was the adoption by London Transport (it has to be said, with initial scepticism) of Harry Becks map of the Underground, with its dramatic diagrammatic representation of the lines vertically, horizontally or diagonally, and with the central area taking up space on the map out of all proportion to its geographical size.
<BR>
<br>Train design advanced considerably with the introduction of 1938 tube stock, which not only incorporated the latest engineering and electrical developments but also provided enhanced levels of passenger comfort, all within a sleek, clean-lined car body exhibiting a strong impression of modernity and efficiency.
<BR>
<BR>The RT bus, perhaps the most elegant of London Transports double-deck buses, was first introduced in 1939, although the 1939-1945 war interrupted full-scale production. The RT represented a fine example of both engineering and design expertise combining to provide a vehicle thoroughly suited to London and its travelling public.  The first post-war venture into new bus design resulted in the development of the famous Routemaster (RM) double-deck vehicle.  World-renowned as the most successful bus design of its era, the Routemaster is still to be seen in large numbers in central London.
<BR>
<br>Much of the same design thinking was applied on the Underground to the Victoria Line, opened in 1969, and the Jubilee Line, opened in 1979.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DESIGN IN LT TODAY</B></font>
<br>The amalgam of the best from the past and the need to accommodate the increasing demands of technological advance and passenger expectations has created many challenging design opportunities.  These challenges include improved accessibility and ease of movement within the transport system for elderly and disabled passengers.  Design is used today, as it always has been, to find better, safer, more cost-effective and efficient solutions in order to create attractive conditions for passengers and staff.
<BR>
<br>As in Picks time, London Transports rle as a patron of both art and design continues today, with the appointment of the best architectural and design practices to help secure solutions which are both practical and appropriate to contemporary and future requirements.
<BR>
<br>Artists and illustrators are commissioned to produce work as part of the Art on the Underground campaign, a tradition developed by Pick when he commissioned such artists as Edward McKnight Kauffer, Graham Sutherland and Laura Knight in the 1920s and 1930s.  This tradition carried on through to into the 1960s, after which it lost impetus until revived in recent years.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN IN LT TODAY</B></font>
<br>Design is employed to provide and enhance Londons bus and Underground services in three areas:
<BR>
<br>Architecture and Environments
<br>London Transports infrastructure, notably the places at which services are provided such as Underground and Bus stations, have always contributed to the visual wealth of the Capital, and their appearance and functionality remain important.  As busy places, their layouts have to be safe and well-ordered in order to accommodate the vast numbers of passengers who use them daily.
<BR>
<br>Products
<br>These include not only the rolling stock (trains and buses) but also ticket machines, seats and escalators, as well as Help Points and other features which contribute to passenger security and safety.
<BR>
<br>Information
<br>The provision of information so that passengers can use the system with confidence is perhaps the most important of design applications.  Today this includes sophisticated electronic displays showing destinations and waiting times and other passenger information messages.  Such information will hopefully also become generally available to bus passengers if the "Countdown" bus-stop information project currently on trial in several areas of London is successful.
<BR>
<br>Without clear, concise and visually appealing printed material, many passengers would be unable to understand and use LT services.  Marketing and publicity published within the framework of London Transports corporate identity assists in maintaining the passengers perception of LTs integrity as a public transport authority.
<BR>
<br>Today the challenge for design at London Transport is to live up to and re-create its design tradition of elegance and functionality; and to use design as a business tool in a complex commercial environment.  As well as being central to London Transports corporate philosophy, design impacts upon most, if not all, of its operations and activities.  There are design issues implicit in every programme, contract or investment which LT undertakes.  Design, not unlike any other commercial discipline, has to be managed if sensible, efficient and implementable solutions to problems are to be found.

<p>There are several schemes for both light rail and metro developments in London which are in the planning stages.  Some will become reality, others will fall by the wayside.  Those which succeed in being built will alter the shape of railway travel in and around London in the 21st century.
<BR>
<BR>Details of current projects being promoted by London Underground, such as the Jubilee Line Extension, CrossRail, the Chelsea-Hackney Line and the East London Line Extensions can be found in London Underground Fact Sheet No 6, Future Expansion and Development.
<BR>
<BR>
Details of London Transport's views on future policy in its widest sense well into the next century are published in the booklet "Planning London's Transport", available free from LT's Corporate Relations Office, 55 Broadway, London  SW1H OBD.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HEATHROW EXPRESS</B></font>
<BR>This joint BAA/Railtrack project is now under construction.  Due to open in 1998, it will provide an express service connecting Heathrow with Paddington (where passengers will be able to interchange with the London Underground Hammersmith &amp; City, Bakerloo, District and Circle Lines), with a journey time of just 16 minutes.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THAMESLINK 2000</B></font>
<BR>This 650 million scheme received formal Government approval in February 1996.  It will vastly expand the existing north-south cross-London Thameslink services.  In addition to existing services, to the north there will be Thameslink services to Peterborough and Kings Lynn, and to the south to Guildford, Bognor Regis, Littlehampton, Eastbourne and East Grinstead.
<BR>
<BR>There will be major infrastructure improvements, mainly in the London Bridge area (new flyovers and platform) and Blackfriars (where there wil be additional access from the south side of the river). The capacity of the Snow Hill Tunnel (under the City of London) will be quadrupled from six to 24 trains per hour in each direction.  The centrepiece of the scheme would be a new station at St Pancras, adjoining the terminus of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (see below).

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>WOOLWICH RAIL CROSSING</B></font>
<BR>This scheme would involve the construction of a railway tunnel under the River Thames at Woolwich, connecting the North London and the North Kent Lines.  This new rail link would assist in the regeneration of east London and north Kent as part of the Government's Thames Gateway initiative.  It is possible that construction could start in 1998 and trains could be using the tunnel by 2001.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CHANNEL TUNNEL RAIL LINK (CTRL)</B></font>
<BR>The Government announced at the end of February 1996 that London and Continental Railways is the successful consortium which will construct and operate the 109 km (68 mile) high-speed line to carry international and domestic trains between London St Pancras and the Channel Tunnel.  There will be intermediate stations at Ashford and Ebbsfleet and Stratford.  An extension of the Woolwich Rail Crossing (see above) could create a modern metro link between Stratford and Ebbsfleet, allowing easy interchange with international services.  Up to eight domestic trains an hour will run between London and Kent over the new link, and this will have an impact on the number of passengers using the London Underground at King's Cross/St Pancras.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SOUTH LONDON RAIL STUDY</B></font>
<BR>London Transport is committed to the long-term strategic planning of Londons rail system, and the South London Rail Study arose from a large number of proposals for extending the Underground into various areas of south London.  Included in the research are the implications of extending the Northern, Victoria and Bakerloo Lines.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DOCKLANDS LIGHT RAILWAY (DLR) EXTENSION TO LEWISHAM</B></font>
<BR>An extension from the Isle of Dogs southwards under the River Thames to Lewisham via Greenwich and Deptford has always appeared to be a sound investment, giving commuters from Kent a quicker means of access to the rapidly growing Isle of Dogs employment area.  Under LTs stewardship, an Act of Parliament was obtained which secured the necessary land and gave authority for construction to go ahead.  Docklands Light Rail and the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) are now seeking partners to construct the extension within the terms of the Governments Private Finance Initiative.  It is hoped to begin construction in 1996.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OTHER LIGHT RAIL PROPOSALS</B></font>
<BR>The possibility of other light rail projects in London is currently under review.  London Transport has undertaken an initial study in outer London in discussion with local authorities, and nine possible areas for new links are now being looked at in greater detail.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Environmental issues are of increasing concern in London, with much of this debate focusing on transport.  The 18th Report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, "Transport and the Environment" (HMSO, 1994), expressed concern about the increasing dependence on the car.  The most evident effects of this dependence are potential social disadvantage for people without access to private transport, traffic congestion and environmental noise and air pollution.
<BR>
<BR>London Transport's main contribution to the protection of the environment is its rle in providing, or arranging, the comprehensive and safe provision of an efficient public transport network in Greater London.  LT is committed to encouraging greater use of its services, by improving both their quality and their quantity as far as its resources allow.  In 1994/95, on both the buses and the Underground, the number of journeys was higher (by four per cent) than the previous year, and passenger levels are expected to remain buoyant in the current 1995/96 year.  Clearly there are a number of factors - not solely environmental ones - underlying this increased use of the buses and the Underground.
<BR>
<BR>Nevertheless LT takes every opportunity to argue the case that public transport rather than the private car should be chosen for journeys within London, because buses and trains are more efficient in their use of urban land and have a less polluting effect on the atmosphere.  On the other hand, LT also recognises that its own operations can have an environmental impact and fully accepts its obligation to reduce that impact.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SETTING ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS</B></font>
<BR>London Transport issued a full environmental policy in March 1995 setting out the need for improving the quality and effectiveness of its services and thereby encouraging even greater numbers of people to choose public transport rather than cars for their journeys.
<BR>
<BR>LT will work through its subsidiary companies and departments (London Underground, London Transport Buses, Victoria Coach Station, the LT Museum and all its supporting corporate services) to implement in detail agreed environmental policies in all its activities.  These policies will comply with relevant environmental legislation.  Management policies and practices will have regard to environmental considerations and provide adequate staff training for these purposes.
<BR>
<BR>LT will also seek to minimise adverse environmental impacts during the construction and operation of new infrastructure and services.  LT will ensure that environmental information is disclosed and publicly reported.
<BR>
<BR>In particular, significant steps are being undertaken to implement an Environmental Management System (EMS), based on the British Standards Institute's environmental standard, BS 7750, throughout London Transport.  The EMS will cover in a co-ordinated manner all activities with an environmental impact, such as waste management, effluent discharge, use of herbicides and energy management.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LONDON TRANSPORT BUSES</B></font>
<BR>Every day LT Bus services carry 3.7 million passengers, with an average journey length of 3.4 km (2.1 miles).  Buses in London constitute 1% of the total traffic flow but carry 14% of the passengers travelling by road.
<BR>
<BR>LT Buses is committed to ensuring that its activities make a positive contribution to the protection and improvement of the environment.  It believes that public transport by bus provides the most environmentally efficient mode of motorised road travel in London.  LT Buses aims to make an increased contribution to environmental improvements by raising further the quality of bus services, and by promoting greater use of buses and awareness of their environmental benefits.  Nevertheless the operation of buses inevitably involves some potentially negative effects on air quality.
<BR>
<BR>All bus services are now run by private operators under contract to LT.  LT Buses works with its contractors to minimise any adverse environmental impacts of the services operated under contract.  Wherever possible, LT Buses awards contracts to companies which operate buses with the highest emission standards, and the use of high quality diesel fuel is encouraged where practicable.  Diesel engines are generally less polluting than petrol engines, except for oxides of nitrogen and particulates where emissions are higher.  For all other road traffic pollutants, buses are more environmentally friendly than petrol-engine vehicles.
<BR>
<BR>Recent research suggests that LT Bus services contribute 2% of nitrogen oxides and 3% of particulate materials in London's air.  LT Buses is carefully monitoring several trials of emission control technology and modified fuels to assess the potential benefits of using them on all of London's existing bus fleets.
<BR>
<BR>In the next few years, there will be a dramatic improvement in bus services, with buses being given priority in reserved lanes on many main roads in London, involving some 1 200 km of the 2 900 km total bus route network.  This development is emerging through two initiatives, the London Bus Priority Network in association with the London Boroughs, and the Priority (Red) Route Network under the auspices of the Traffic Director for London.  Bus lanes, and other priority measures like bus-activated traffic lights, quite properly give preference to buses over cars because of the greater efficiency of buses in moving large numbers of people while taking up relatively little road space.  When the network is fully in place, and provided there is proper enforcement, London Transport confidently expects that many car users who currently drive into central London, or into suburban town centres in Greater London, will be attracted to buses, with a major consequent gain to the environment.
<BR>
<BR>These bus priority measures, which cost relatively little in relation to the benefits they bestow, are particularly important in the immediate future as a means of attracting car drivers to public transport, because the major rail schemes planned for London, of which only the Jubilee Line Extension is so far being constructed, inevitably require massive funding over a longer-term time-scale.
<BR>The problem of providing a public transport facility for people who do not have access to a car is being met by London Transport Buses' aim over time to provide a service within 400 metres of most homes in London to link to the nearest town centre.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LONDON UNDERGROUND (LUL)</B></font>
<BR>Over half of the million people who travel to work into central London every day use the Underground for all or part of their journey.  The trains are electrically powered and their operation is virtually pollution free.
<BR>
<BR>However the generation of the electricity does have an environmental impact.  About 70% of the power for Underground trains is at present produced at London Underground's own generating stations at Lots Road in Chelsea and at Greenwich.  These stations are natural gas fired, although they can also operate on oil as a standby fuel.  LUL is reviewing its policy on generation and examining how best the capacity of Lots Road can be replaced.  Increasing the proportion of electrical power supplied through the national grid system will reduce emissions, as the power stations supplying the grid are cleaner and more efficient
<BR>.

<BR>London Underground is continuously looking at other ways in which it can reduce both its demand for energy and the general environmental impact of its operations.  Recent and current initiatives include:
<BR>
<UL>
<BR><LI>environmental assessment of all new projects - the Jubilee Line Extension, the Croxley Rail Link, the Piccadilly Line Extension to Heathrow Terminal 5, and the East London Line Extensions;
<BR>
<BR><LI>the Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) has an Environmental Management System (EMS) which is based on British Standard BS 7750. It provides
an overall management structure which aims to limit as far as practicable
the impacts identified through the Environmental Assessment
of the JLE project;
<BR>
<BR><LI>a pilot study has been undertaken to implement the BS 7750 EMS standard
on the Metropolitan Line.  Since October 1995, the line's performance
has been assessed against this standard, and if successful
the Metropolitan Line will be the first railway in Britain to achieve
the standard;
<BR>
<BR><LI>the new trains on the Central Line use 35% less energy than the trains
they have replaced by generating current when braking which can be used
by other trains;
<BR>
<BR><LI>additional bicycle racks have been installed at stations to encourage 	passengers to cycle rather than drive to and from their Underground train;
<BR>
<BR><LI>lineside areas have been planted with shrubs which absorb larger amounts
of carbon dioxide.
</UL>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LIGHT RAIL</B></font>
<BR>The environmental advantages of the Underground are even stronger in the case of a light railway, which can run on streets in town centres (as is planned in central Croydon with the Tramlink scheme), and which needs less land than a full-scale railway when running on its right of way.  Stations are often spaced only 500 or 600 metres apart, bringing public transport closer to residents and to shops/employment in town centres.  LT is undertaking studies to investigate the potential for "intermediate modes" in nine locations in outer London and will shortly extend this work to review potential schemes in inner London.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>VICTORIA COACH STATION</B></font>
<BR>Coach travel provides inexpensive long-distance public transport at a fraction of the environmental cost of private transport.  The LT subsidiary company, Victoria Coach Station (the main central London terminal for express national and international coach services) is committed to safeguarding or improving the environment through its activities, and considers this as an essential part of its operation and viability.<BR>
Victoria Coach Stations aims to:
<UL>
<BR><LI>eliminate unnecessary running of engines on the premises;
<BR>
<BR><LI>ban coaches with poorly-maintained engines;
<BR>
<BR><LI>eliminate wasteful consumption of energy and water on the premises;
<BR>
<BR><LI>require the highest standards of cleanliness of the premises,
and the proper disposal of waste;
<BR>
<BR><LI>promote the environment-friendly coach industry, without an adverse impact on the immediate neighbourhood.
</ul>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LONDON TRANSPORT MUSEUM</B></font>
<BR>The LT Museum exists to preserve, explain and create an awareness of London's public transport.  Situated in Covent Garden and welcoming nearly 250,000 visitors each year, it aims to promote the positive connections between LT and the environment both through communicating with the public via displays and through internal management.
<BR>LT Museum is improving the impact of its activities on the environment by:
<BR>
<BR><LI>efficient energy management;
<BR>
<BR><LI>reducing and managing waste and minimising the use of environmentally 	harmful materials;
<BR>
<BR><LI>improving the appearance of the Museum's building and displays;
<BR>
<BR><LI>contributing to the management of the impact of tourism on the environment.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</B></font>
<BR>When London's urban public transport was brought together in 1933 under the auspices of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), the bus services covered a vast area consisting not only of what is now Greater London but also much of the adjacent counties.  Within Greater London, the bus route network was complemented by tram and trolleybus systems.  The trams were finally withdrawn in 1952 and the trolleybuses a decade later in 1962, with bus replacements in each case.
<BR>
<BR>From 1970 to 1984, London Transport was under the direct control of the Greater London Council, and the area for which LT was legally responsible contracted to the present 1 630 sq kms (630 sq miles), with a few bus and Underground services continuing into outlying areas beyond the Greater London boundary to maintain well-established links.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</B></font>
<BR>Under the London Regional Transport Act 1984, London Transport was again brought under central Government control.  The Act required LT to set up subsidiary companies to run the buses and the Underground, and also stipulated that competitive tendering should be introduced wherever possible to ensure that LT operated economically and required less financial assistance from public funds for the day to day running of its services.
<BR>
<BR>In 1985, bus services outside London were deregulated which meant that any licensed operator could apply to run a new route even if another company already ran a service along the same roads.  London was however specifically exempted but it was intended that, once bus services in London had become less dependent on Government subsidy and steps had been taken to encourage greater competition between the operators, deregulation should be extended to the Capital as well.
<BR>
<BR>The subsidiary company set up in 1985 by London Transport to run the bus services was known as London Buses Limited (LBL).  However, route planning and the level of fares charged remained LT responsibilities.  In the same year LT set up the Tendered Bus Division to begin the process of the competitive tendering of its bus routes, under which LBL was required to compete against operators in the private sector for the opportunity to run individual bus routes on behalf of LT.  The routes were awarded to the operator which could run the best service at the most cost-effective price, and initially several of these routes went to private companies rather than to LBL.  Buses again began to appear on London's streets whose livery was not traditional LT red.
<BR>
<BR>LBL inherited many problems, not least huge garages which were expensive to maintain, and restrictive work practices.  Both made it harder to compete with the private operators.  As a step towards the planned deregulation of bus services in London, LBL therefore created thirteen locally based subsidiary companies, each with its own commercial remit.  These companies conducted their own wages negotiations with the unions, took appropriate steps to reduce their overheads such as by closing and merging garages, and competed against each other as well as against the private sector companies for the contracts to run LT bus routes.  The subsidiaries became increasingly successful in competing for routes.
<BR>
<BR>In December 1992, the Government announced that the LBL companies would be sold into the private sector ahead of deregulation.  However, a year later, the Government decided to postpone deregulation until after the next General Election.  The privatisation of the LBL subsidiaries went ahead as planned by the beginning of 1995, with the companies being sold either to other bus operators or to management and employee buy-outs.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>The Operating Services department supports the private bus operators which run routes under contract to LT Buses by providing the infrastructure (stops, stands, stations etc) and also by implementing as necessary short-term measures such as diversions when ceremonial events, accidents or roadworks occur.
<BR>
<BR>The department is also responsible for the 24-hour emergency control room which bus operators can contact by radio; for passenger and staff security (see separate LT Buses Fact Sheet on Bus Safety and Security); for a revenue protection service (see separate LT Buses Fact Sheet on Fare Evasion); and Smartcard technology for fare collection (see separate London Transport Fact Sheet on Fares).
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>BUS INFRASTRUCTURE</B></font>
<BR>There are five operating areas, South East, South West, North West, North East and Central, which are responsible for the maintenance of bus stops, shelters, stands (terminal points), and stations in each area.  Area managers arrange for timetables and other publicity and information to be displayed correctly at bus stops and on bus shelters and for it to be constantly updated - not a small job with 17,000 bus stops in London.  New, improved, bus shelters are being introduced at the rate of some 1,500 a year.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CENTRECOMM</B></font>
<BR>London Transport Buses radio control centre, known as Centrecomm, is staffed round the clock to co-ordinate a response to the many emergencies reported by London bus drivers every day.  With a direct line to the Metropolitan Police control room at New Scotland Yard, the emergency services can usually reach any incident a few minutes after the initial call by the bus driver.  Centrecomm also keeps drivers informed of incidents or developments (for example road accidents or railway disruptions) which may have repercussions on their route.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P>THE BACKGROUND</B></font>
<BR>The system of bus route tendering began in London in 1985, when the Tendered Bus Unit was set up by London Transport to oversee the process under which existing, revised and new bus routes were progessively put out to competitive tender, as required under the London Regional Transport Act 1984.  Companies including LT's own bus operating subsidiary, London Buses Limited (LBL), competed against each other for the contracts to run bus routes.  In April 1994, in anticipation of the sale of the LBL bus companies into the private sector, LT Buses was set up to co-ordinate all London Transport's bus-related activities.  From the same date all former LBL routes which had not by that date been subject to the tendering process were placed on a "net cost" contract basis (see next section).
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><P>WHAT IS PROCUREMENT?</B></font>
<BR>The competitive tendering process is known today as procurement, and now that the former LBL companies have been sold into the private sector, it is the task of the LT Buses Procurement Department to secure tenders from private companies wishing to operate the bus routes in the London Transport network.
<BR>
<BR>Advertisements inviting bids to run bus routes are regularly advertised in the bus industry press and those companies expressing an interest are provided with information about each route such as the hours and days of service, the type of bus required for the route (double-deck, single-deck or midibus), and the frequency of service.  This information enables the companies to submit their bids to run the route, some on their own initiative perhaps using their local knowledge to offer an even better service likely to attract additional passengers.  The sealed bids are reviewed once the closing date is reached and the contract is awarded to the company offering the best quality of service for the lowest payment (not necessarily to the lowest bidder).  It is assumed that the bidder will make suitable allowance in the bid for ensuring the contract will be profitable.  The results of the procurement process are made known well in advance of the start date of the new contract to allow the successful operator time to obtain the vehicles and to recruit and route-train the staff.
<BR>
<BR>Contracts are currently awarded on a "gross cost" basis under which the operator hands back to LT all its on-bus receipts and receives from LT a payment each month for running the service, subject to satisfactory performance under the terms of the contract.  Over the years ahead, however, contracts are going to be increasingly (and by 2001 totally) awarded on a "net cost" basis.  Under this system  (which already applies on those former LBL routes which were not offered for competitive tender), the operator retains all cash fares received on the buses, and receives a proportion of the revenue arising from the use of Bus Passes, Travelcards and concessionary permits for travel on the buses.  Net cost contracts will usually be awarded to the contractor needing the lowest subsidy above the revenue they expect to make from these sources, but full payment is of course dependent on the operator achieving reasonable quality standards.  Throughout a contract, each route is monitored to ensure that the operator is providing a high quality service.  Factors such as reliability, politeness of staff and vehicle maintenance are checked, and form targets laid down in the London Bus Passenger's Charter.  Every month quality of service monitoring results are published showing whether these targets are met.
<BR>
<BR>Contracts are reviewed after a set number of years (usually for three to six years) and may either be re-tendered or renegotiated with the existing operator if the performance has been satisfactory.  Some contracts include special clauses, specifying for example low-floored buses or access for wheelchairs.  All new contracts for routes operating in central London stipulate that buses must be predominantly red.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>London Transport Buses routes must be planned to benefit the maximum number of passengers, but within the limits of the financial resources available as London Transport receives no Government grant for day to day operations of its services.  Planning London's bus route network is the responsibility of the LT Buses Market Development Department.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>BUS ROUTE PLANNING</B></font>
<BR>It is LT Buses ultimate aim to provide a bus service within 400 metres of most homes in London to link with the nearest town centre.  Initially LT Buses surveys an existing route or group of routes to gauge passenger journeys and build planning models for analysing the demand or potential demand for buses.  This information can be used to improve the local services so that they are more convenient for local people.  When a revised network is decided upon, further calculations are made to work out the service frequencies and the size and type of bus which would best meet passenger requirements.
<BR>
<BR>The proposed changes are then subject to a period of public consultation during which the local authority, and residents of roads where bus routes are planned for the first time, can express their views which are carefully considered before final decisions are made.  Once a decision to introduce a new or revised service is taken, the next stage is for London Transport Procurement to arrange for an operator to run the service.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>IMPROVING RELIABILITY</B></font>
<BR>LT Buses is committed to making bus services a genuinely attractive alternative to driving in London, but although considerable effort is put into publicity campaigns to attract car users on to buses, the best possible advert for LT Buses is improved reliability.  But reliability depends on ensuring that buses are given the priority which reflects their outstanding ability to move large numbers of people while taking up minimal space on congested roads.  The LT Buses Fact Sheet, Traffic Congestion and London's Buses, describes the initiatives currently being implemented.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>COUNTDOWN</B></font>
<BR>Although bus timetables at stops advertise an even interval service frequency, the regular user knows that the timetable cannot always be relied upon, mainly because of the effects of traffic congestion.  This is why the Market Development Department is developing Countdown, which involves fitting the buses on the routes covered by the system with electronic bus location equipment.  Roadside microwave beacons activate radio links to bus-mounted transponders equipment, which allows the progress of a bus along the route to be monitored every 30 seconds.  A central computer then  transmits predicted arrival times to dot matrix indicators installed at principal bus stops, giving the waiting time for the next buses serving that stop.
<BR>
<BR>The display units also have the facility to relay messages about service delays.  This real-time information system is already in use in parts of north and west London, and the Countdown scheme focused around the Nag's Head intersection in Holloway ( involving 24 day and five night routes) is the largest of its kind in Europe.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Traffic congestion is a major problem in Greater London.  The scale of the problem was indicated by a recent Confederation of British Industry (CBI) estimate which put the cost of congestion to businesses in London and the South East at 10 billion a year.  The damage however is not just financial.  Congestion also causes frustration, and affects the environment.  The main cause is too much traffic yet it is predicted that the number of vehicles using London's streets will increase, making the conditions under which buses have to operate even worse.
<BR>
<BR>The bus is an integral part of the Government's plans to confront London's traffic problem.  More bus priority schemes, long needed, are now in prospect but they must be backed up both by better enforcement of parking restrictions and of bus lane regulations and by moves to restrict the volume of traffic.  Illegal or inconsiderate parking, one of the major causes of traffic congestion, delays buses and makes them less reliable, but if buses were able to operate along less congested streets at regular intervals many motorists would be encouraged to leave their cars at home and travel instead by bus.  This would make the roads less crowded and bus services would become even more attractive.  The situation can only improve when buses are accepted as the most efficient users of London's scarce road space.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RED ROUTES AND THE LONDON BUS PRIORITY NETWORK</B></font>
<BR>Red Routes
<BR>In early 1993 the Traffic Director for London produced plans for designating 500 km of London's strategic road network as Red Routes.  This followed the success of a pilot scheme along the Archway and Holloway Roads which secured, with other more general benefits (such as a 17% reduction in accidents) a 10% reduction in bus journey times and a 33% improvement in bus service reliability.  A new express service, the X43, was introduced.  Bus routes operate on about 80% (equivalent to 400 km) of the proposed Red Route network, and London Transport Buses have made specific suggestions for bus priority measures to be incorporated into the plans, which are due for completion by 2000.
<BR>
<BR>The London Bus Priority Network
<BR>With only 95 km of bus lanes currently available in London (out of a total bus route network of 3 000 km, and compared with 200 km of bus lanes in Paris), the additional 400 km resulting from the Red Routes will bring about a dramatic improvement to bus service reliability.  But the Red Route scheme is being complemented by an even more significant project, the London Bus Priority Network, which as its name suggests is specifically aimed ar helping buses.  In this project, each of the London Boroughs in conjunction with London Transport Buses, has developed plans for bus priorities on some 800 km of roads carrying eight buses an hour or more.  There is a crucial commitment from the Boroughs for a high level of enforcement by wardens to ensure that the benefits to buses and their passengers are gained.  The aim is to cut journey times by at least 25% during peak periods and by 15% at other times.  Together these two major initiatives should give buses priority on 1 200 km of the London Transport Buses route network.
<BR>
<BR>Bus Priority at Traffic Lights
<BR>Already in existence is a scheme to give buses priority at some 300 traffic light controlled junctions in outer London.  Around 4 000 buses operating on LT Buses routes have been fitted with a transponder which either turns traffic lights to green as the bus approaches or keeps lights at green for long enough to allow the bus to pass.  Traffic lights in central and inner London are however controlled by computer, and technology is being developed to enable the transponders to bring the same benefits to bus passengers in these areas.
<BR>
<BR>This valuable development is complemented by schemes now being introduced to give buses priority over other traffic by means of a traffic light at the end of a bus lane, allowing buses to get ahead of other road vehicles.  The most notable example of this bus priority is at the busy Shepherd's Bush Green junction through which 93 buses an hour pass at peak times and where bus journey times have been cut by up to 50%.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SOME FACTS ON BUSES AND CONGESTION IN LONDON</B></font>
<BR>
<UL>
<BR><LI>over 3.7 million journeys are made on London's buses on a typical weekday
<BR>
<BR><LI>congestion is not confined to peak periods only: in some parts of London
it persists all day and even seven days a week
<BR>

<BR><LI>congestion delays can often be unpredictable, resulting from roadworks or
an accident or from just one illegally parked car forcing two lanes of traffic
down to one
<BR>
<BR><LI>average traffic speeds in central London can be as low as 16 kmh (10 mph)
<BR>
<BR><LI>in central London, the average car occupancy is 1.3 persons in peak periods,
but a double-deck bus can carry as many people as 60 cars

<p>Fare evasion and other ticket irregularities on London's buses cost London Transport Buses an estimated 23 million a year, around 5% of its revenue.  Surveys have shown that one bus passenger in 20 on average is travelling with some form of ticket irregularity during a journey.  Fare evasion is a criminal offence, and LT Buses carries out private prosecutions of alleged offenders who, on conviction, could face a maximum penalty of 1,000.  Those convicted are likely to have to pay the costs of the prosecution and compensation, as well as the fine imposed.
<BR>
<BR>As a further deterrent, a 5 Penalty Fare was introduced in April 1995, and passengers found travelling without the correct ticket or pass for the whole of their journey may have the penalty imposed by a Revenue Protection Inspector.  These Inspectors operate on all LT Buses services, both in uniform and in plain clothes.  Their job is to inspect tickets, catch offenders and deter potential fare evaders.
<BR>
<BR>The single biggest fare evasion problem on London's buses is over-riding, accounting for an estimated 61% of total lost revenue.  Over-riding occurs when passengers pay a cheaper fare than they should or use a pass beyond the zone for which it is valid.
<BR>
<BR>Other methods of fare evasion include avoiding paying a conductor, and using a borrowed, stolen, forged or altered pass.

<BR>Passenger safety is the highest priority of London Transport Buses and for the private bus companies which operate the services under contract to LT Buses.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE LEGAL POSITION</B></font>
<BR>The law relating to bus operation requires that all companies, and their senior operating managers, must be specifically licensed as competent to run bus services.  All bus drivers must pass a rigorous driving test and medical examination before they can obtain a full Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV) licence.  The buses must conform with the exacting Construction and Use Regulations which focus particularly on the safety-related aspects of vehicle design.
<BR>
<BR>  All buses are subject to an annual test by Department of Transport Inspectors, as well as to random tests out on the road, to check on the quality of day-to-day maintenance.  The Traffic Commissioners supervise the enforcement of these provisions, with powers to discipline operators who do not meet the high standards required, ultimately including the revocation of their licences.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE RLE OF LT BUSES</B></font>
<BR>London Transport Buses closely monitors the performance of its contracted operators on safety matters, and keeps records of all incidents affecting safety.  LT Buses regularly assesses the quality of bus maintenance facilities and the standards achieved, and reviews the results with the operators.  LT Buses may offer support for the development of safety features which can benefit all the bus operators in London, and through its route tendering and contract regime LT Buses can influence the provision of safety-related facilities on new bus deliveries.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE RLE OF THE BUS OPERATORS</B></font>
<BR>The prime responsibility of the companies which are awarded contracts to operate the bus routes in the LT Buses network is to carry passengers safely.  They employ and train skilled maintenance staff to look after their fleets, and both train their drivers to the required standards and regularly monitor in-service performance to ensure that these standards are maintained.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PASSENGER ACCIDENTS</B></font>
<BR>There are far fewer boarding and alighting accidents on driver-only buses than on Routemaster buses which have an open rear platform.  Although the traditional Routemaster is popular with passengers, the freedom to hop on and off can lead to a higher incidence of accidents.  Passengers have a responsibility to use buses safely, for example by sitting down when there is a seat available.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PASSENGER AND STAFF SECURITY</B></font>
<BR>Assaults on passengers and other crimes such as robbery are rare on buses, but nevertheless are of great concern to LT Buses.  Video recording systems on buses act as a deterrent and can help to identify assailants with the film being used as evidence in court.
<BR>
<BR>Most buses have two-way radios so that drivers can call for help.  Most of these radios provide immediate access to the LT Buses emergency communications centre, Centrecomm, which has a direct link to the Metropolitan Police at New Scotland Yard.  Assault alarms which activate lights on the outside of the bus and sound the horn to attract attention are also fitted.  Police travel free of charge on London's Buses both in and out of uniform.
<BR>
<BR>Every effort is made to ensure the safety of bus staff.  The commonest cause of an assault on a member of staff is a problem over a fare or a ticket.  Other causes include arguments with motorists following a traffic incident, hooliganism, boarding or alighting disputes, robbery or even unprovoked assaults.  Conductors are four times more likely to be the victim of an assault than a driver-operator.  The majority of London's driver-only buses are fitted with special cab screens.
<BR>
<BR>Staff are trained in the most effective ways of handling difficult situations and thereby avoid the possibility of assaults.  With over 70 per cent of bus passengers now using pre-paid tickets, the amount of cash being carried on board buses has decreased, thus reducing the opportunity for fare disputes and robbery.
<BR>
<BR>London Transport Buses Revenue Protection Inspectors operate across the whole of the route network 24 hours a day.  Their presence and activities help to reassure law-abiding passengers that LT Buses is concerned for their security.  Close liaison is also maintained with the Metropolitan and other Police forces on local security issues, and joint exercises are held to counter problems which arise.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE FIRST BUSES</B></font>
<BR>The distinctive features of a bus service are that the buses run to a fixed timetable along a specific route stopping at intervals to pick and set down passengers, with fares which are cheaper than those charged by taxis.  On that basis, London's first buses began operating between Paddington and the Bank on 4th July 1829.  They were horse-drawn carriages with facing seats along the sides for 20 passengers.  There was a driver in charge of the horses and a conductor who rode at the back where passengers boarded and alighted through a door.  The fare for the whole journey was one shilling (5p) or sixpence (2 p) to the Angel, Islington.  For that period these fares were relatively expensive and certainly put bus travel beyond the means of most Londoners (making a mockery of the full name, omnibus, which is Latin meaning "for all people").
<BR>
<BR>This novel mode of transport was introduced to London by George Shillibeer, who had observed horse-bus services running in Paris and saw an opportunity for a similar operation here in London.  He exploited the fact that his line of route, the New Road (now the Marylebone and Euston Roads), was outside the limits where the horse cabs had a monopoly.  That monopoly quickly crumbled under the rush of new bus operators.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE HEYDAY OF THE HORSE BUS</B></font>
<BR>By the time of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in 1851, the traditional British double-deck design had appeared, with passengers sitting back-to-back on the roof which was reached by a staircase at the back.  Another 20 years later, forward facing seats were introduced on the upper deck, but passengers continued to be exposed to the elements until well into the motor bus age.
<BR>
<BR>Competition between bus operators was initially fierce, but from 1855 a French company, the Compagnie Gnrale des Omnibus de Londres, began to buy up many of these operators.  By 1858, when it was registered in this country as the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC, or The General for short), it already ran most of the 800 buses in London.
<BR>
<BR>By the end of the 19th century, there were some 3 500 horse buses in London, and commuting - not only by bus but also by train and horse tram - had become a normal feature of working life.  But the rle of the horse on London's roads was being challenged.  Experiments had been carried out to find a self-propelled road vehicle, and battery, steam and internal combustion engines were all tried.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE EMERGENCE OF THE MOTOR BUS</B></font>
<BR>By 1905 it was clear that the petrol engine was the way forward with an engine fitted where the horse had been, ahead of the driver.  This development quickly led to the famous mass-produced B-type double-deck motor bus which first appeared on London's streets in1910.  They were very reliable, and proved their worth during the 1914-1918 war when many were sent to France as troop carriers.  To mark the bravery of many of the drivers who took their buses into the battle zone, the LGOC was invited to take part in the Remembrance Parade at the Cenotaph.  London Transport (LT) is still accorded this honour today, the only civilian organisation allowed to take part in this annual ceremony each November.
<BR>
<BR>During the inter-war years, the bus route network developed into the comprehensive system which today's bus passengers would recognise, particularly after the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was formed in 1933.  The LPTB incorporated the General and all the other competing bus companies as well as the trams, trolleybuses (electric buses powered from overhead wires), express coaches and the Underground.  In bus design, the two most significant developments were the introduction in 1925 of pneumatic in place of solid rubber tyres, and of a roof over the upper deck once police fears that such an addition in weight would make the bus unstable were finally overcome.  In 1929, an enclosed cab for the driver and enclosed staircase for passengers added new standards of comfort.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE RT AND ROUTEMASTER (RM)</B></font>
<BR>The LPTB embarked on designing its own buses in its own workshops at Chiswick, a programme which was initiated with the first buses of the RT type in 1939.  However, the outbreak of war interrupted the programme, and Chiswick Works was converted to aircraft production.  Large-scale introduction of the diesel-engined RT type buses was not resumed until the withdrawal of London's trams ten years later, by which time the design of this classic London bus had been revised to incorporate standard interchangeable parts allowing simplified maintenance and overhaul.
<BR>
<BR>7 000 RTs joined the LT fleet, but by the mid-1950s the next generation of purpose-built London bus was already being designed.  London Transport's finest bus, the Routemaster (RM type), was wider and carried more passengers than the RT (64 seats compared with 56) yet was lighter being designed without a chassis.  Some 500 of these magnificent buses, of which over 2 800 originally entered service mainly to replace London's trolleybuses in the early 1960s, have recently been refurbished.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DRIVER-ONLY BUSES</B></font>
<BR>All the buses up to the Routemaster needed a crew of two staff, the driver in the cab at the front and a conductor to collect fares and look after the safety of passengers as they boarded and alighted (just as was the case in 1829).  With the growth of private car traffic, however, London's buses no longer covered their costs of operation.  This in turn made it inevitable that London Transport adapted to what was already commonplace elsewhere, one-person operation of its buses.  The vehicles had to be radically redesigned, with the engines at the back so that passengers could board at the front and pay their fare, or show their Travelcard or Bus Pass, to the driver.
<BR>
<BR>Today all but a very small percentage of London bus routes are operated in this way.  The other major transformation in the last 25 years has been LT's decision to buy buses from the manufacturers rather than design itself a bus suited specifically to the congested conditions of London's streets.  The buses running in the Capital today include double- and single-deck vehicles, and shorter midibuses which are more suitable in environmentally sensitive residential areas.  Increased awareness of the needs of passengers with disabilities has also had its impact on bus design with both "kneeling" buses, where the front suspension can be lowered at stops to allow easier access, and others with a wheelchair lift.
<BR>
<BR>From 1995, all buses operating London Transport's bus services are owned by private companies, but working with these operators LT looks forward to a resurgence in bus travel in London.  In the years immediately ahead buses will be given greater priority over other road vehicles which will attract even more passengers.  For this expanding market, buses in future will be equipped with the latest technology to speed ticket checking and aid bus location, thereby ensuring that the bus will continue to play a leading rle in London's public transport network.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE EARLY YEARS</B></font>
<BR>The world's first underground railway, with trains hauled by steam engines, was opened by the Metropolitan Railway Company on 10th January 1863.  The initial section of line was six km (nearly four miles) in length, between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street, and provided a rail link from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to the City of London.
<BR>
<BR>By the end of 1868 another company, the Metropolitan District Railway Company, had opened a line between Westminster and South Kensington, where it linked up with extensions to the Metropolitan Railway.  The Circle Line of today was complete by 1884.  These lines were built by the "cut and cover" method which involved digging a deep trench for the railway and then covering it over.  By the end of the 19th century, the Metropolitan Railway had been extended out across Middlesex and through Hertfordshire into Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury and beyond.
<BR>
<BR>The oldest section of the Underground, the Thames Tunnel built by Sir Marc Brunel and his famous son, Isambard, in fact predates the Metropolitan Railway by 20 years.  The tunnel carries the East London Line under the Thames between Wapping and Rotherhithe, and although it was designed for horse-drawn traffic, it opened in 1843 for pedestrians only.  It became a railway tunnel in 1869, and the following year another railway under the Thames opened with a cable-hauled line between the Tower and Bermondsey.  That venture was no more successful in its original guise than the Thames Tunnel, being converted for pedestrian use after just a few months and closed when Tower Bridge opened in 1894.
<BR>
<BR>Tunnelling under the Thames required a different engineering approach from the cut-and-cover method, involving deep-level excavation at the foot of vertical shafts (similar to coal mining).  As much of London is built on clay which is easy to excavate tunnels through, the next significant step in the development of London's Underground railways was the twin-tunnel City and South London Railway, which ran for 5.2 km (3.25 miles) from King William Street in the City under the River Thames to Stockwell.  This was planned as a cable-hauled railway, but it opened in 1890 as the world's first deep-level electric railway.  This and subsequent similar lines have since always been known as tube railways.
<BR>
<BR>The Waterloo &amp; City Railway, also under the River, opened in 1898, followed two years later by the Central London Railway, known as the "Twopenny Tube", from Shepherd's Bush to the Bank.  Its popular name came from its flat fare of 2d (just under 1p).  Early this century, three American-financed tubes were built.  The Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway (soon abbreviated to "Bakerloo") opened in 1906; the Great Northern, Piccadilly &amp; Brompton Railway (also opened in 1906 and now part of the Piccadilly Line); and the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (opened in 1907 and now part of the Northern Line).

<BR><font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>EXPANSION</B></font>
<BR>The Underground expanded rapidly between the wars, reaching Ealing Broadway in 1920, Edgware in 1924 and Morden in 1926.  1932 and 1933 saw the Piccadilly extended to Uxbridge and Cockfosters, and the District to Upminster.  The Metropolitan reached Watford in 1925 and Stanmore in 1932.
<BR>
<BR>A single authority, never officially but always popularly known as London Transport, was set up in 1933 and immediately began formulating plans to expand the Underground both by building new extensions and by incorporating existing suburban lines.  However the 1939-1945 war intervened, and eight km (five miles) of tunnel on the uncompleted eastern extension of the Central Line even became an underground aircraft component factory.  Many tube stations were used as shelters.  After the war, the Central Line scheme was completed, with the new tunnels to Newbury Park opening in 1947, and the extensions to West Ruislip and Epping opening in 1948 and 1949 respectively.
<BR>
<BR>The first new tube line in central London since 1907, the Victoria Line, was opened in 1969, with the southern extension to Brixton following in 1971.  In December 1977 an extension of the Piccadilly Line beyond Hounslow West to Heathrow Airport was opened, and a further single-track loop to serve the airport's new Terminal 4 opened in 1986.  The Jubilee Line was opened in 1979.
<BR>
<BR>Work started on the 1.9 billion Jubilee Line Extension in December 1993.  Designed to carry up to 30,000 people per hour in each direction, the 16 km (ten mile) line will run from Green Park to Stratford via Westminster, Waterloo, Southwark, London Bridge, Bermondsey, Canada Water, Canary Wharf, North Greenwich, Canning Town and West Ham.  It will help stimulate the regeneration of Docklands, relieve congestion on roads and on other lines, dramatically improve rail connections and bring parts of south and east London within reach of the Underground network for the first time.  The line will be completed in 1998.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE UNDERGROUND TRAIN</B></font>
<BR>Throughout the history of the Underground there have been two distinct types of train - known as surface and tube.  The term "surface" applies to the trains on the Metropolitan, District, Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, and East London Lines, the oldest parts of the Underground system.  They run through double tunnels just below ground level, and are larger than the trains which run on the "tube" lines (Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City).
<BR>
<BR>The earliest surface trains were hauled by steam locomotives fitted with special equipment which condensed much of the spent steam back into water.  Electric trains first appeared on surface lines in the early 1900s.
<BR>
<BR>Steam locomotive-hauled trains were obviously out of the question on the deep-level tube lines and the early trains on these lines were hauled by electric locomotives.  In 1903 the Central purchased motor cars, which had a driving cab and a compartment behind the cab housing the motors.  This style became standard on tube lines for the next 35 years, but from 1936 London Transport introduced trains with the motors and other electrical equipment below the floor, thereby increasing seating capacity.
<BR>
<BR>Trains built between 1959 and 1964 for the Central and Piccadilly Lines had unpainted aluminium bodies, and those built in 1967 for the new Victoria Line were also equipped for automatic operation.
<BR>
<BR>On the earliest Underground trains, passenger entry and exit was by way of mesh gates at the end of each car.  The gates were opened and closed by gatemen.  Air-operated doors were introduced on tube trains from 1920.  Trains on surface lines had passenger-operated sliding doors, rather than gates, from the early 1900s, and air doors from the mid-1930s.  The latest surface and tube cars have passenger-operated doors with push-button control.
<BR>
<BR>In the first significant use of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) for funding major public transport projects, GEC Alsthom will provide 106 new trains for the Northern Line.  With the first train due to be in service by the end of 1996, they will replace some of the oldest trains on the system.
<BR>
<BR>A major element of the near-completed Central Line modernisation is the new fleet of state-of-the-art tube trains.  Built in Derby by ABB Transportation the 1992 stock are among the most advanced metro trains in the world.  The Jubilee Line Extension will bring another new fleet of trains to London, to be built by GEC Alsthom, the first 30 of which will start operating on the existing Jubilee Line during 1996.
<BR>
<BR>The existing train fleet is currently undergoing refurbishment.  The Circle, Victoria, Bakerloo, Piccadilly and Metropolitan Lines are all having or have had their trains refurbished and decorated with the new red, white and blue livery.  Plans are also being made to modernise District Line trains.

<p>London Underground Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of London Transport.  The company was formed in 1985, but its history dates back to 1863 when the world's first Underground railway opened in London.
<BR>
<BR>London Underground is a major business, with 2.5 million customers a day, some 470 trains, 245 stations, more than 16 000 staff and vast engineering assets.  The provision of passenger services is the core activity and is managed through nine general managers, each in charge of one, two or three of the Underground's lines run as business units.  Other departments are structured to provide the necessary back-up to ensure the safe and efficient provision of passenger services to the company's customers.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE BOARD</B></font>
<BR>The Chairman of London Underground is Peter Ford, who is also Chairman of London Transport.  The Managing Director is Denis Tunnicliffe, who is also a member of the Board of London Transport.
<BR>
<BR>Other LUL Board members are Tony Sheppeck, who is also full-time LT Board Member for Finance, Hugh Sumner (passenger services), John Hughes (finance),  Ann Burfutt (human resources), David Bailey (development), David Hornby (engineering), and Norman Cohen (marketing), together with Bob Dorey and Keith Davies both of whom are also non-executive Members of the LT Board.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PASSENGER SERVICES</B></font>
<BR>Services are managed by eight line-based business units, with a small head office support team.  The general managers and their addresses are:

<p>Under each line general manager, the management of the workforce is based on the concept that each member of staff should have a named boss to whom they will be directly accountable for their own performance, irrespective of the shift being worked.
<BR>Similarly, every station has a single manager who is always responsible for it, irrespective of shifts.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SUPPORT SERVICES</B></font>
<BR>In addition to the local line management, London Underground has its own engineering and development directorates.  Expert support in areas such as finance, marketing and human resources is provided by London Transport.  The Underground has its own Division of the British Transport Police force.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>Until the mid-1980s, the issue and collection of tickets on the London Underground had changed very little since the early days of the system.  Tickets were purchased from booking clerks in ticket offices, or alternatively at the busier stations from various types of free-standing automatic machines, many of which had been in use since the 1930s.  Tickets were then surrendered to a ticket collector at the end of the journey.<BR>
<BR>In recent years, fare structures have been considerably simplified.  The introduction of zonal charging and the popular Travelcard in 1983 coincided with the need to replace much of the existing equipment, so the opportunity was taken to modernise fare collection methods on the Underground.
<BR>Today's system features:
<UL>
<BR><LI>modern, self-service ticket machines which issue a wide range ofdaily tickets and give change;
<BR>
<BR><LI>automated ticket checking on entry and exit at busy central London and some suburban stations;
<BR>
<BR><LI>secure ticket offices for staff;
<BR>
 and
<BR>
<BR><LI>a data capture and communication network covering all stations to provide
centralised accounting reports and up-to-date management information.
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>The design and operation of automatic ticket gates ensures that they will open in the event of a power failure and that they can be opened with an emergency push button for evacuation purposes.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FRAUD</B></font>
<BR>London Underground, through regular fraud surveys and mathematical models, estimates that each year a total of 30 million pounds is lost from revenue through all types of fraud.  The most common type of activity is the use of the system without a ticket or travelling with an invalid ticket.  The introduction of automatic ticket gates in the late 1980s allowed major advances in deterring ticketless travel, but the system is still open to abuse by those determined to defraud the company.
<BR>
<BR>May 1993 saw the appointment of Nick Agnew as General Manager Revenue Support after previously being in charge of the District Line.  The remit of the Revenue Support team is to improve both revenue control and collection on the Underground.  Included in this is the need to improve both ticket selling facilities, so that customers have more options available to buy tickets, and methods of deterrence to stop fare evaders, such as the introduction of Penalty Fares.  As well as Penalty Fares there are other measures London Underground regularly uses to clamp down on fare evasion and other types of fraud.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PENALTY FARES</B></font>
<BR>The London Regional Transport (Penalty Fares) Act 1992 enabled 10 Penalty Fares to be introduced across London Underground.  Customers are liable for a Penalty Fare if they are found to be travelling on the system without a valid ticket, unless they were genuinely unable to obtain a ticket at the start of the journey.
<BR>
<BR>Before introducing Penalty Fares, London Underground invested 8 million to make ticket purchase easier for the customer.  All ticket-issuing machines were modified to ensure they are in "change giving" mode more often and to allow them to accept twenty, ten and five pound notes.
<BR>
<BR>It is believed that the Penalty Fare of 10 is a sufficient amount to deter ticketless travel.  The intention of Penalty Fares is to encourage all customers to have in their possession a ticket valid for the full journey they are making before they travel, rather than to penalise the honest customer.
<BR>
<BR>Anyone issued with a Penalty Fare can either pay it on the spot or pay the Penalty Fare in part, with payment in full within 21 days.  Cash, credit cards and cheques will be accepted as either full or part payment by Revenue Inspectors.  Where customers do not pay in full or in cash, the Inspectors have the right to obtain the customer's name and address, which they can have checked on the spot.  Anyone who does not pay within the 21 days could ultimately be taken to County Court.  There is an appeals procedure for those who feel they have been unfairly treated.
<BR>
<BR>The introduction of Penalty Fares in April 1994 has resulted in more than 5 million additional fares revenue being raised in a full year.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>STATION AND TRAIN CHECKS</B></font>
<BR>Each line has its own Revenue Control Manager and a team of Revenue Control Inspectors whose rle is to assist the line in maximising its revenue.  The most common way of doing this is through their presence on both stations and trains checking tickets.  Revenue Control Inspectors often carry "swipe machines" which read a ticket's magnetic display to give details of where and when it was bought and the last time it was used.  They also organise special checks and exercises, often working in plain clothes.
<BR>
<BR>London Underground still has the powers to recommend persistent and deliberate fare evaders for prosecution through the British Transport Police and the courts.  The courts are able to impose sentences of either a 1 000 fine or three months in prison.  In 1993 there were 6 811 prosecutions for fare evasion with another 6 635 cases reported to the police.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FUTURE PLANS</B></font>
<BR>London Underground would like to install gates at many more stations in its bid to cut down on fraud.  However, this requires large-scale investment at a time when infrastructure renewal demands a high priority.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Safety is at the heart of London Underground (LUL) and has the active support and commitment of the LUL Board.  The design of the system itself has many vital safety features, particularly the "fail safe" signalling system which activates a train's brakes automatically if it passes a signal set at danger or approaches a terminal too fast.  The technology of the system is supported by operational procedures and rules and by a well-trained workforce.  The total effort to maintain and improve safety is driven by a structured safety management system.  As a result, railways and especially the Underground, are one of the safest forms of passenger transport.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SAFETY MANAGEMENT</B></font>
<BR>The foundation stone of good safety performance is a comprehensive, formal and systematic regime for managing safety.  In 1989/1990, London Underground adopted the International Safety Rating System (ISRS) as a proactive safety management tool, with externally verified audits.  The initial ISRS awards have been maintained or improved in all operational areas, and have been extended to head office and support functions.  More recently, London Underground has progressively introduced its own rigorous Safety Management System (SMS) - based on the ISRS - to reflect the specific needs of the company.
<BR>
<BR>The essence of good safety management is the identification of risk; the development of worthwhile measures to eliminate, control or reduce the risks; and audit and monitoring to ensure that established systems and new measures are effective.  The underlying principle is one of continuous improvement.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RISK ASSESSMENT</B></font>
<BR>London Underground has undertaken a quantified risk assessment to identify the risk of customer fatality on the system, including the risks of incidents which have never actually happened but which could possibly occur.  The biggest risk is flooding of the deep-level tube system.
<BR>
<BR>The relative importance of the other main risks is shown in the graph below:
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LONDON UNDERGROUND RISK PROFILE</B></font>
<BR>(excluding flooding)
<BR>
<BR>(% contribution to total risk, excluding risks under 0.2%)
<BR>The company also undertakes comprehensive assessment of the safety and health risks faced by its workforce.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>REDUCING RISK</B></font>
<BR>The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 places an obligation on all firms to reduce risk to a level which is "as low as reasonably practicable" (ALARP).  No activity can be absolutely safe, but London Underground strives to identify all risks and to eliminate or reduce them wherever the cost is not disproportionate to the safety benefit.  Some of the steps London Underground is currently taking to tackle risk are:
<BR><ul>
<BR><LI>flood prevention works;
<BR>
<BR><LI>removal of wooden steps from escalators, and of fire hazardous materials from trains;
<BR>
<BR><LI>measures to reduce accidents during boarding/alighting from trains
(for example, tv screens in cabs to give drivers a clear view of
the platform not only when the train is at a platform but also
on the approach to or when leaving a station; barriers between cars; and platform edge doors on the Jubilee Line Extension);
<BR>
<BR><LI>equipment to prevent drivers from inadvertently opening doors
on the wrong side of the train; and
<BR><LI>a programme to reduce the risks to staff working on or near tracks.
<BR></UL>
<BR>On the Jubilee Line Extension (due to open in 1998) there will be a number of improved safety features.  In addition to platform edge doors, there will be walkways in the tunnels along which passengers can be escorted to safety if they should need to leave trains in an emergency; large-scale circulation areas at stations to reduce congestion; and smoke control equipment.  All these features in combination will make this new section of the Underground about ten times safer than the existing system.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>ASSET HEALTH</B></font>
<BR>Much of the Underground was built before the 1914-1918 war, and there is now a considerable backlog in the replacement of assets which have reached the end of their useful life.  The Monopolies and Mergers Commission Report on London Underground in 1991 recommended a consistent annual funding level of 750 million to clear the engineering backlog on the existing system.  Although funding from the Government has not achieved this level, nevertheless there have been sufficient grants - together with internally generated funds - to enable progress to be made in renewing life-expired assets.  It is currently estimated that, of assets worth roundly 19 billion (at Modern Equivalent Asset Value), some 4% are in a condition which raises concern for safety.  In the short term, pending replacement or repair, London Underground is controlling this risk through exceptional maintenance or inspection regimes, or by restricting use of the asset to ensure that no undue risk is posed (for example, through speed restrictions or even by taking it out of service).

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS</B></font>
<BR>Every operational location on the London Underground has emergency plans covering all foreseeable emergencies such as fire, overcrowding and acts or threats of terrorism.  Staff have regular evacuation drills, and there also procedures for the rapid shutdown and evacuation of individual Underground lines and even of the entire system.  Regular joint exercises are held with the emergency services and with other organisations such as Railtrack to test and refine the procedures.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE</B></font>
<BR>As part of its safety management system, London Underground has a comprehensive incident reporting system.  All serious incidents are investigated to identify root causes, and recommendations are made to help prevent any recurrence.  Including near misses, there are about 55 000 incidents reported each year, of which approximately 8 000 are health, safety or environment related.
<BR>A breakdown of customer accidents in1994/95 is shown below:
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CUSTOMER ACCIDENTS 1994/95</B></font>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Major incidents may also lead to a formal investigation by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) which is the arm of the Health &amp; Safety Executive responsible for regulating safety on railways.  In the case of the King's Cross fire in November 1987 (in which 31 people died), the Government ordered a judicial inquiry led by Sir Desmond Fennell.  The Fennell Report made 157 recommendations, of which 127 applied to London Transport.  The 127 recommendations involved 158 separate actions, of which 143 are complete, and progress is ongoing on the remaining longer-term actions.

<BR>Key actions which London Underground has implemented include staff selection, training and deployment; emergency preparedness; communications; safety auditing; and the need for proactive safety management. The King's Cross fire also led to the Fire Precautions (Sub-Surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989.  These apply to the 112 below ground stations, and cover fire detection and suppression; fire alarms; the installation of compartments to prevent fires from spreading; evacuation procedures; staff training; and the use of fire-resistant materials at stations.
<BR>The number of confirmed fires, the majority of which are on the track, has been progressively reduced in recent years, as shown in the table below:

</table>

<BR>London Underground also learns from accidents on other systems, for example it has implemented the relevant recommendations from the report by Sir Anthony Hidden into the British Rail accident near Clapham Junction.
<BR>
<BR>Effort is also invested in the proactive search for problems before they cause accidents, by use of structured audit programmes and by general inspections, safety tours and surveys by managers and staff at all levels.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY</B></font>
<BR>The health and safety of staff is a key concern.  The Underground has an established network of health and safety representatives who work with managers and their colleagues to identify potential hazards, and to find ways of reducing or eliminating them.  Lost time injuries to staff average about 3.5 per 100 employees per year, and the dominant causes are assaults (30%) and slips, trips and falls (25%).
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>SAFETY CASE</B></font>
<BR>The privatisation of the national railway system has led to the introduction of the Railway Safety Case Regulations.  Safety Cases were originally developed in the chemical, nuclear and off-shore oil industries, and involve a clear and auditable  statement of the way in which risks are identified and managed to a level as low as is reasonably practicable.  Ongoing changes of significance must be demonstrably safe.  London Underground has a Safety Case which has been accepted by HMRI (and by Railtrack for services operated over its infrastructure).

<BR>


<BR>The history of the development of the railways which now make up the London Underground shows that the vast majority of the central London lines were built before the First World War, with the suburban extensions largely being constructed in the period before and after the Second World War.  Since then, the most significant development has been the building of the Victoria Line, opened in stages between 1968 and 1971.  Additionally, the Jubilee Line, created by linking the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo Line to a new tunnelled section between Baker Street and Charing Cross, opened in 1979 and the Piccadilly Line was extended to the central terminals at Heathrow Airport in 1977 and to Terminal Four in 1986.
<BR>
<BR>As the number of passengers using the Underground rose during the 1980s - from 500 million in 1982 to 800 million in 1988 - it became clear that the lines and stations which had been built in Victorian and Edwardian times were increasingly unable to accommodate them.  Ideas for various new lines had been suggested several times from the 1950s onwards, but in March 1988 the Government set up the Central London Rail Study specifically to address the problem of rail congestion.  The purpose of the Study was to suggest ways of providing for the forecast increase in passengers on London's railways - estimated to be in the order of a further 20 per cent on the Underground by the end of the century.  Without the construction of new lines the system will become impossibly overcrowded, with serious effects on London's economic prosperity.
<BR>
<BR>A parallel East London Rail Study was also set up by the Government to examine possible solutions to the problem of increasing access to the rapidly growing Docklands area and to East London generally.  A number of proposals have arisen from these and other studies.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CROSSRAIL</B></font>
<BR>A line running east/west across central London in tunnels was the major proposal in the Central London Rail Study.  Known as CrossRail, and similar in concept to the RER lines in Paris, this line would carry specially designed high-capacity trains from Aylesbury (via Amersham), Chesham and Reading to Shenfield in the east.  The trains would enter the tunnelled section near Paddington and emerge at Bethnal Green having served intermediate stations at several key London interchanges.  CrossRail would provide direct access to central London from areas currently without such a service, relieving congestion at rail terminals like Liverpool Street.  It is also proposed that services could feed into CrossRail from the new Heathrow Express line.  A Bill seeking the necessary powers to build the line was rejected by a committee in Parliament in 1994 and the Secretary of State has now asked that the scheme be taken forward under the Transport and Works Act.  A draft Order is being prepared, and the line could be open by 2004.  Ways of involving the private sector in the project are being explored.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CHELSEA-HACKNEY LINE</B></font>
<BR>This proposal for a new Underground line has been mooted for some considerable time, but was revived by the Central London Rail Study.  The current proposals envisage the line taking over part of the existing District Line branch from Wimbledon and then running via a new station in Chelsea to Victoria.  It would continue via Piccadilly Circus and Tottenham Court Road to King's Cross (relieving congestion on the Victoria Line).  From here, it is planned that the line would run through Islington to Hackney, giving interchange with suburban rail lines and then take over the Epping branch of the Central Line north of Leytonstone.  The route of this line is protected against developments which might jeopardise its construction, pending a Government decision as to when to proceed.  Alternative alignments or phasing options which might increase the benefits were the subject of public consultation in late 1995.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>JUBILEE LINE EXTENSION</B></font>
<BR>Improved access to Docklands is a priority to serve the recent and future growth in this developing area of London.  An extension of the Jubilee Line to this area of London was proposed when the line was first built in the 1970s but, at present, the line stops at Charing Cross.
<BR>
<BR>The East London Rail Study recommended that the line should run from Green Park to Westminster, Waterloo, Southwark and London Bridge, continuing through Bermondsey and the growing Surrey Quays area to Canary Wharf in the Isle of Dogs.  The line would continue to Stratford via North Greenwich, Canning Town and West Ham.
<BR>
<BR>Construction work on the 16 km (ten-mile), 1.9 billion (at 1993 prices) project began in December 1993, and the first trains will run in the spring of 1998.  The scheme creates 22 000 jobs from its construction and other effects.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>EAST LONDON LINE</B></font>
<BR>Proposals to extend the East London Line both north to Dalston and south to East Dulwich have been evaluated and both schemes have significant potential benefits.  At around 100 million, the proposals are also relatively inexpensive because they use much existing infrastructure.
<BR>
<BR>Powers to construct the northern extension were sought under the Transport and Works Act in November 1993 and an Inquiry has been completed.  Work on this section, including four new stations, could start in 1997.  However, funding for the project is not currently available, and private sector involvement is being sought.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CROXLEY RAIL LINK</B></font>
<BR>A London Underground project to link two lightly used branch lines in the Croxley and Watford area has been developed.  This would allow Metropolitan Line trains to serve Watford High Street and Watford Junction stations, and four potential intermediate station sites have been identified.  Design work is complete and  it is planned that powers will be sought to construct the link under the Transport &amp; Works Act in early 1996.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HEATHROW TERMINAL 5</B></font>
<BR>BAA is seeking to build Terminal 5 at Heathrow, and a scheme to extend the Piccadilly Line to serve a station within the new terminal has been drawn up in tandem with BAA's plans.  An application under the Transport and Works Act was submitted in November 1994 and what is likely to be a lengthy Inquiry into the proposals both for the terminal and the extension started in 1995.  If authorised, construction could start in 1997 and the line could be open by 2002.

<BR>The Poems on the Underground concept was launched in January 1986.  Originally the brainchild of American novelist, Judith Chernaik, the aim was to exploit unfilled advertising spaces on the Underground to bring poetry to the vast and largely captive audience of 2.5 million travellers who use the network daily. The project is administered by Ms Chernaik who, together with poets Cicely Herbert and Gerard Benson, selects the poems for inclusion.  London Underground meets the design and production costs of the project. A new set of five poems appears about three times a year.  Copies of each poem are posted in train cars where spaces are available and the selection traditionally consists of a mixture of styles from past and contemporary poets from both home and abroad.
<BR>
<BR>The 100th Poem on the Underground appeared in September 1991, coinciding with the launch of an anthology of the first 100 poems.  An enlarged illustrated hardback version of the poems anthology was published by Cassell in October 1992, and is available from all good book stores or from the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden, price 4.99 (paperback) and 9.99 (hardback).  Cassell also publishes a book with a selection of the poems, price 1.99.
<BR>
<BR>The posters are available from the London Transport Museum, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7BB, (telephone 0171-379 6344) price 1.50 per poem (including postage and packing), 5 per set or 20 for an annual subscription of three sets (including postage and packing).
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>ART ON THE UNDERGROUND</B></font>
<BR>Art on the Underground continues the Underground's traditional rle of patron of the arts dating from the early years of the century.
The current initiative presents work by fine artists - which would otherwise be restricted to viewing by gallery audiences - for public consumption on the Underground.
Around three works are commissioned annually and to date, more than 50 art posters have been commissioned since the initiative began in the mid-1980s.  The subjects highlight places of interest to be found close to Underground stations and the chosen artists work in a wide variety of media and with differing styles.
<BR>
<BR>Popular posters include
<BR> "The Tate Gallery by Tube" - a model in plastic by David Booth (1986);
<BR> "The New Kew" - a watercolour by Jenny Tuffs (1987);
<BR> "Chinatown" - an oil on canvas by John Bellany (1987);
<BR> "Days on the Water" - an oil on canvas by Sandra Fisher (1989);
<BR> "Highgate Ponds" - a gouache on board by Howard Hodgkins (1990);
<BR> and contemporary photography by Martin Parr (1991) in conjunction with the BBC2 television series, Signs of the Times.
<BR>
<BR>Around six thousand copies of each poster are printed in four-sheet, double-crown or escalator panel format, and the posters are used to fill unsold advertising spaces on the system.  Prior to the launch of the current initiative, empty spaces were filled with plain black posters which were often vandalised with graffiti.
<BR>
<BR>Copies of the posters are available direct or by mail order from the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden (telephone 0171-379 6344); prices range from 3.95 to 9.95.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>There are two distinct types of train on the London Underground: the larger surface stock operating in the original cut-and-cover construction twin-track tunnels on the Circle, District, East London, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan Lines; and the smaller tube stock running in the single-track deep-level tunnels on the Bakerloo, Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City Lines.  Tube gauge cars are 750mm (2 ft 6 in) lower in height than surface stock, with a floor height above rail level of 610mm (2 ft) compared with 980mm (3 ft 3 in) on surface stock.  Almost all Underground trains are made up of two units consisting of three or four cars permanently coupled together.
<BR>
<BR>Common to all the lines on the London Underground is both the gauge of the tracks, which is the standard 1,435mm (4 ft 8  in), and the electric current system, 630 volts dc (direct current) with separate positive and negative rails.
The carriages are always known as cars on the London Underground, reflecting the influence of American finance on the rapid expansion of the system in the early years of the 20th century.  All lines are one-person operated, except the Northern Line which will retain guards to operate the doors pending delivery of new trains currently on order.
<BR>
<BR>After many years when Underground trains were unpainted, which left them looking unattractive when graffiti was removed, every train is now being given a standard London Underground livery with red fronts and doors and white and blue sides.  Special paint is used from which it is a simple task to remove graffiti.
<BR>
<BR>This fact sheet lists the distinctive features of the trains on each line.
<BR>
<BR><B>Bakerloo Line</B>
<BR>The Bakerloo Line has a fleet of 35 trains of 1972 Mark Two tube stock, of which 31 are required for peak period service.  These trains are seven-car versions of the eight-car 1967 tube stock trains operating on the Victoria Line.  They share with 1967 tube stock the design feature of wrap-round driver's windows, and were similarly designed for automatic operation although they remain manually driven by the train operator.  They were built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham and underwent mid-life refurbishment by Tickford Rail Limited at Rosyth Royal Dockyard between 1991 and 1995.

<BR>
<BR>The Bakerloo Line's depts are at Stonebridge Park, Queen's Park and London Road, Lambeth, with additional siding space at Elephant &amp; Castle.
<BR><BR><B>Central Line</B> (also Waterloo &amp; City Line)
<BR>The Central Line has a fleet of 85 eight-car trains of 1992 tube stock built by ABB Transportation in Derby, of which 72 are required for peak period service.  There are five identical four-car trains on the Waterloo &amp; City Line, with four in service in peak periods.  The trains entered service between 1993 and 1995, and incorporate the latest automatic train operation technology (not yet implemented, pending the introduction of new moving block signalling).
<BR>
<BR>The doors on 1992 tube stock trains are wider than on other trains on the Underground to allow speedier entry and exit for passengers, and are mounted on the outside of the trains to provide more internal space.  Passenger-operated open and close buttons have been fitted, offering a valued facility in winter when only those doors through which passengers wish to board and alight are opened, thereby ensuring the minimum loss of train heat at open-air stations.  There are windows at the ends of the cars to improve passenger security, and all the windows along the sides of these trains curve up towards the roof enabling standing passengers to read station names signs on platforms more easily. There are additionally automatic digitised announcements at stations for the benefit of passengers with sight impairment.  A doors closing beep also assists these passengers.
<BR>
<BR>Every axle has a motor for smooth and rapid acceleration (important for improving train frequency), and regenerative braking is provided to recycle energy.  As a safety aid, the driver has television screens in his cab showing the platform while the train is approaching, standing at and leaving a station.  The driver can make announcements to passengers and they additionally can speak to the driver in an emergency.

<BR><B>Circle Line</B>
<BR>(also Hammersmith &amp; City Line and
District Line, Edgware Road to Wimbledon, service)
<BR>The Circle Line requires a maximum of 14 C stock trains and the peak period Hammersmith and City Line service requires a further 16.  A maximum of ten trains of the same rolling stock runs on the Edgware Road service of the District Line where the shorter platforms exclude that Line's D stock trains.  In all there are 35 six-car trains which entered service in 1970-1971, known as C69 stock, and 11 introduced from 1978, known as C77 stock.  The unique feature of these trains is the four sets of double doors in each car to cater for the heavy loadings and relatively short journeys made on the Circle Line by passengers travelling to and from the many main line railway termini along the route.  C stock trains have a doors closing beep to assist sight-impaired passengers.
<BR>The C stock trains were built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham, and underwent mid-life refurbishment by RFS Industries in Doncaster between 1991 and 1994.

<BR>(for trains serving the Edgware Road branch, see Circle Line)
<BR>For its main operation between Upminster in east London and Richmond, Ealing Broadway and Wimbledon to the west and south west, together with the shuttle link to and from Olympia, the District Line has a fleet of 75 six-car D78 stock trains, of which 66 are required for peak period service.  The two distinguishing features of D stock trains are the four wide single-leaf doors, as on Jubilee Line trains, and the tube stock size wheels introduced as a first stop towards providing greater standardisation.  The trains were built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham and entered service between 1979 and 1983.

<BR>The Metropolitan Line has a fleet of 56 eight-car trains and one four-car train of A60 and A62 stock, of which 42 are required for peak period service.  These trains were designed for longer-distance journeys with entirely transverse high-backed seating and no seats over the wheels facing inwards as on other Underground trains.
<BR>The A stock trains were built by Cravens in Sheffield and entered service between 1961 and 1963 after the line had been electrified to Amersham and Chesham and electric and steam locomotive-hauled trains had been withdrawn.  The trains are being refurbished by ABB Transportation in Derby in a programme due to be completed in 1997.

The newer 1972 Mark One tube stock trains are seven-car versions of the eight-car 1967 tube stock trains operating on the Victoria Line.  They share with 1967 tube stock the design feature of wrap-round driver's windows, and were similarly designed for automatic operation although they remain manually driven by the train operator, with a guard to control the operation of the doors.  They were built by Metro-Cammell in Birmingham and entered service between 1972 and 1975.
<BR>
<BR>  The older trains of 1959 and 1962 tube stock, also crew-operated, were built by Metro-Cammell, initially entering service on the Central and Piccadilly Lines between 1959 and 1964.  They were gradually transferred to the Northern Line between 1975 and 1994.  A complete fleet of new one-person operated trains is on order for the Northern Line.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>The safety and security of customers is top priority at London Underground.  The Underground can never be immune from crime, but many levels of criminal activity - including violent crime - are falling in noted contrast with rising trends nationally.  The measures taken by London Underground jointly with the London Underground Area of the British Transport Police as part of an ongoing programme of security improvements have helped to make the Underground safer.
<BR>
<BR>Since 1987 all crimes have fallen by over 40 per cent, making London Underground one of the safest metro systems in the world.  In recent years, representatives from Russia, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong, Washington DC, New York, Paris and British Rail have visited the London Underground to learn how to prevent crime.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRIAL MEASURES</B></font>
<BR>With crime reaching its peak on the Underground in 1987 a series of pilot measures was commissioned by London Underground, in conjunction with the BT Police. Complementing these measures, BT Police at the same time decentralised its operations with new stations at Stockwell and Finsbury Park, and the concept of a Home Beat Constable was developed.
<BR>
<BR>Costing 3.5 million the pilot schemes were undertaken at three groups of stations to test measures which could be implemented elsewhere on the Underground.  The three areas adopted were stations at the southern end of the Northern Line, which had the highest violent crime rate per passenger of any on the system; Oxford Circus, where petty crime such as pick-pocketing was prevalent; and the eastern end of the Central Line, where crime was virtually non-existent but passengers' perceptions were of a very high level of crime.
<BR>The security measures introduced at the stations involved included:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>Closed-circuit television (CCTV)
<BR>
<BR><LI>Staffed Focal Points
<BR>
<BR><LI>Help Points, linking the platforms to control rooms, ticket offices, Station 	Operations Rooms and BT Police
<BR>
<BR><LI>Improved station lighting
<BR>
<BR><LI>Passageway mirrors
<BR>
<BR><LI>Brighter station decor
<BR></UL>

<BR>The trials were successful, on the Northern Line in particular, considerably reducing the level of crime.  The Control or Focal Points introduced on the Northern Line have proved to be popular with staff and passengers alike.  They are large glass-fronted offices and contain CCTV monitors, video recorders and station radio system and various other monitors.  Also they provide a location where the passenger can locate a member of staff.
<BR>
<BR>A number of lessons were learnt from the pilot schemes, in particular resulting in a new design of Help Point which has been fitted at several stations.  This design will be introduced progressively throughout the central area.  The white round Help Points incorporate a green emergency button, a blue information button, and at deep-level and sub-surface stations, fire alarm panels.  Operation of the information button immediately connects the passenger with a member of staff.  If, after pressing the emergency button, a member of staff does not answer the call within ten seconds, the call is transferred to the British Transport Police control room at St James's Park.
<BR>
<BR>Colour CCTV forms a key part of London Underground station management philosophy.  Originally, CCTV was used simply as a means of control/surveillance of passenger flows.  More recently, surveillance for security and safety reasons has become a priority, influenced by the Department of Transport's 1986 report "Crime on the Underground" and by the report into the King's Cross fire.  Colour CCTV systems now provide extensive views of platforms, passageways, escalators and other strategic areas.  Increasing use is being made of video records.  In addition to local monitoring, pictures from all CCTV cameras are available to the British Transport Police control room at St James's Park.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE, LONDON UNDERGROUND AREA</B></font>
<BR>The British Transport Police is principally responsible for policing the national railway systems, but there is a special division consisting of some 420 uniformed and plain-clothed officers which is concerned solely with the London Underground.  Specialised squads exist to deal with car park theft, pickpocketing and graffiti.  Full civilian back-up is provided.
<BR>
<BR>Policing of the Underground is monitored via a control room at St James's Park.  The room, the most modern of its kind in Britain, has CCTV colour monitors capable of monitoring all the CCTV cameras on the system, video recording facilities, a modern touch-screen telephone system and radio communication with all officers, above or below ground, on stations, on trains or in the street.  In addition to the control room, local police posts with appropriate complements of officers and back-up staff are located at Aldgate, Baker Street, East Ham, Finsbury Park, Hammersmith, Heathrow, Stockwell and Wembley Park.  A new police station is planned for Canning Town in connection with the opening of the Jubilee Line Extension in 1998.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LADBROKE GROVE</B></font>
<BR>A new approach to providing security at a group of stations is being tried out on the Hammersmith &amp; City Line between Hammersmith and Paddington.  Each of the eight stations in the group has colour CCTV cameras which are continuously video recorded in the Group Station Control Room (GSCR), located at Ladbroke Grove. There are CCTV-monitored waiting areas on all platforms fitted with draught screens and Help Points, and it is eventually hoped to provide public telephones and vending machines in the area.  The new design of Help Point has been installed at each station.  Staff are linked by radio to the GSCR, which houses all the video recording and monitoring equipment.  Each station has its own dedicated monitor in the GSCR and all the cameras are linked to the British Transport Police control room at St James's Park.  An emergency generator is provided so that the GSCR can continue to function in the rare event of a major power failure.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>GRAFFITI</B></font>
<BR>During the late 1980s London Underground suffered from the unwanted attention of graffiti daubers, both on stations and on trains.  Many passengers find the presence of graffiti threatening and gain the erroneous impression that the system is mismanaged.  Since 1991 a specific Manager, reporting to the Passenger Services Director, has provided a co-ordinated response on stations, trains and other infrastructure on a system-wide basis.  There is a small graffiti squad within the British Transport Police.
<BR>
<BR>The graffiting of trains is potentially extremely dangerous.  Greater security at train depts has helped counteract the problem, with measures ranging from simple security fencing and suitably trained security guards through to high technology systems using CCTV cameras, infra-red beams and increased lighting.  As part of a major refurbishment of its existing rolling stock, London Underground is providing a high quality paint which will enable any graffiti to be simply and easily removed without damaging the rolling stock.
<BR>
<BR>The annual cost to London Underground of removing graffiti is estimated at 10 million.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>ON-TRAIN SECURITY</B></font>
<BR>One third of the crime on London Underground is committed on trains.  As part of the proposals to address on-train crime, a Piccadilly Line train was successfully fitted with video-recorded colour CCTV in early 1991.  The experiment having been a success, a number of the refurbished Piccadilly Line trains will be equipped with colour CCTV and video recording facilities.
<BR>
<BR>In order to ease the fear of crime while travelling alone, the new designs for refurbished train stock have incorporated improvements as a result of lessons learnt.  End car windows, allowing passengers to see into the next carriage, have been installed in the refurbished trains on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines and on the new Central Line trains.  All trains have brighter interiors making them cleaner, offering a reassuring environment.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PICKPOCKETS, BEGGARS AND BUSKERS</B></font>
<BR>In 1994 over half of all crimes committed on the Underground network were pickpocketing offences.  With 2.5 million passengers using the system every day, the Underground is a happy hunting ground for well-organised thieves preying on foreigners and British people visiting London.  Over 7 000 incidents a year are reported.  The British Transport Police along with Underground staff are now using CCTV to help trap pickpockets, as well as high-profile policing days to ward off the thieves.
<BR>
<BR>Begging on the Underground has increased over the last two years with more and more professional beggars conning customers into giving them money.  The most worrying aspect has been the emergence of so-called Bosnian refugees with children collecting money.  The British Transport Police have concluded that they are itinerant criminals posing as refugees in an attempt to earn money.  A poster campaign on the Underground has recently warned customers against giving money to beggars, suggesting that people should give through organised charities.
<BR>
<BR>Busking has long been a problem on the Underground, both at stations and on trains.  Busking on the Underground is against the London Transport bye-laws, and there is additionally the serious risk that a safety announcement on a train or at a station might not be properly heard because of noise made by buskers.  Station buskers are dealt with locally by individual station managers.  London Underground receives many complaints about on-train busking, which customers find threatening.  Plain-clothed staff have been operating on some Underground lines to catch repeat offenders and to discourage potential buskers.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>MANAGING SECURITY ON THE UNDERGROUND</B></font>
<BR>Phil Jewell is the Personal Security Manager for London Underground.  He can be contacted by writing to the Passenger Services Network Services Department, 55 Broadway, London  SW1H 0BD.   His brief is to look at the security of both customers and staff, and his duties include developing Safer Travel Groups to encourage women's groups, charities, local authorities, businesses, the police and other transport operators to get involved in crime prevention, thereby ensuring a safe journey from door to door.
<BR>
<BR>A scheme has also been devised to allow Underground staff who have been attacked or assaulted to bring private prosecutions against their assailants under civil law.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>Rumour has it that the Bakerloo Line originated from the desire of a few London businessmen to get to and from Lord's Cricket Ground as quickly as possible.  Nevertheless, when the Line opened between Baker Street and Lambeth North on 10th March 1906, over 36,000 customers were carried despite the fact that the cricket season had yet to start.  Originally known as the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, the name was officially changed in July 1906 to the Bakerloo Railway reflecting the nickname coined by the Evening News.  Elephant &amp; Castle station opened in August 1906.
<BR>
<BR>The Bakerloo Line was extended from Baker Street to Queen's Park in 1915, and further north over existing suburban railway tracks to Watford Junction by 1917.  In 1939, a new section was built from Baker Street to Finchley Road which allowed Bakerloo trains to take over the Metropolitan Line's service to Stanmore.
<BR>
<BR>Until the opening of the Jubilee Line in 1979, the Bakerloo operated both Stanmore and Watford Junction services.  The building of the Jubilee Line from Charing Cross to Baker Street, and its connection to the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo Line, left the Bakerloo again with only its Watford Junction branch.
<BR>
<BR>In 1982, the Watford service, by then only four peak period trains, was withdrawn and Queen's Park became the northern terminus once more.  There were some journeys to and from Stonebridge Park, however, to allow access to the new dept there, and in 1984 some peak period trips were extended to Harrow &amp; Wealdstone.  The present all-day, seven days a week, service to and from Harrow &amp; Wealdstone began in May 1989, and has been steadily enhanced in recent years.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE BAKERLOO LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  Each of the lines is a business unit headed by a General Manager.  In charge of the Bakerloo Line is General Manager, Peter McMahon.  Assisting Peter with the task of running the line are:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>Paul Baker, Line Engineering Manager, who is responsible for ensuring the line's engineering facilities - trains, track, signalling, control systems and material supplies - are technically and mechanically fit and reliable and maintained to a high quality.
<BR>
<BR><LI>Daniel Howarth, Train Services Manager, who is responsible for the operation of the service and for ensuring that all aspects of the train service meet customer requirements in a safe and efficient way.
<BR>
<BR><LI>Geoff Dunmore, Business Manager, who is responsible for the 11 stations managed by the Bakerloo Line, including Waterloo, Charing Cross and Piccadilly Circus.
<BR>
<BR><LI>Dave Bellett, Fleet Manager, whose job it is to ensure that the 31 trains needed for the line are available for service.
<BR></UL>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PASSENGERS</B></font>
<BR>In 1995, the Bakerloo Line carried 81 million passengers.  Piccadilly Circus is the Bakerloo Line's busiest station and currently the sixth busiest on London Underground as a whole, with 39 million passengers.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>STATIONS AND TRAINS</B></font>
<BR>The Bakerloo Line covers 23.2 km (14.5 miles) and serves 25 stations, of which 14 are managed either by other Underground lines or, north of Queen's Park, by North London Railways.  North of Queen's Park, Bakerloo Line trains run over tracks owned by Railtrack.
<BR>
<BR>Many of the stations, though subsequently refurbished, date from the early years of this century and were designed in the "Arts and Crafts" style by the Underground Group's Architect, Leslie Green.  September 1994 saw the opening of the new international ticket office area at Waterloo Underground station.  This impressive new customer facility has been spaciously designed to accommodate the fast-growing numbers of passengers arriving in London on the Channel Tunnel Eurostar trains.
<BR>
<BR>Trains run between Elephant &amp; Castle and Queen's Park every 2  minutes during peak periods, when there is a ten-minute service to and from Harrow &amp; Wealdstone.  The type of train operated on the line is 1972 Mark Two tube stock, manufactured by Metro-Cammell of Birmingham, with each train made up of seven cars.
<BR>
<BR>These trains have recently been modernised.  They were mechanically modified and given an all-over face-lift to make them brighter and cleaner, and more pleasant and comfortable to ride in.  The last refurbished train entered service in April 1995.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DEPTS</B></font>
<BR>The main dept for the Bakerloo Line is Stonebridge Park.  Built in the late 1970s on the site of a former British Rail power station, it handles the maintenance of the line's fleet.  There are two smaller depts at London Road (near Elephant &amp; Castle) and Queen's Park where some of the trains are stabled.  Queen's Park is the only dept on the Underground through which trains run in service.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>The Central Line opened on 30th July 1900, as a cross-London route from Bank to Shepherd's Bush and was extremely well patronised.  A flat fare of two old pence (2d) assisted its popularity and some members of the press dubbed the line the "Twopenny Tube".  The twopenny flat fare lasted until the end of June 1907 when a threepenny fare was introduced for journeys longer than seven or eight stations.
<BR>
<BR>In 1908, the line was extended west to Wood Lane to serve the adjacent White City Exhibition site, and four years later was extended from Bank to Liverpool Street.  In 1920, the line was further extended to the west as far as Ealing Broadway.  The Second World War intervened before plans for more ambitious extensions at each end of the line could be implemented, but these plans were revived after the War.  New tracks next to the existing main line railway were brought into use from North Acton to West Ruislip, as were new tunnels from Liverpool Street to Leyton and from Leytonstone to Newbury Park.  North of both of these tunnels the Central took over existing suburban lines, to Ongar via Epping, and to Woodford via Hainault.  The Epping to Ongar shuttle service, which was run under contract by British Rail until 1957, was closed in 1994.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE CENTRAL LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  There are a number of  General Managers with their own headquarters staff controlling daily operations on either a single line or a group of lines.  In charge of the Central Line (and the Waterloo and City Line) is General Manager, Geoff Thackwray, with Mike Chandler as Line Engineering Manager.  Business Manager, Leo Solosy, is responsible for the stations managed by the line; supervising the operation of the line's service is Train Service Manager, Bob Thorogood; and Fleet Manager, Alan Reynolds, is responsible for ensuring that the maximum number of Central Line trains is available for service.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PASSENGERS ON THE CENTRAL LINE</B></font>
<BR>In 1995 the Central Line carried 159 million passengers, making it the system's third busiest line.  Oxford Circus, with an annual passenger count of 72 million is the line's busiest station and the second busiest on the Underground as a whole.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CENTRAL LINE TRAINS AND STATIONS</B></font>
<BR>The Central Line's 74 km (46 miles) make it the Underground's longest line.  It serves 49 stations and requires 72 trains to operate the full peak period service.
<BR>
<BR>The 85 trains, known as 1992 tube stock and manufactured by ABB Transportation in Derby, are the newest on the Underground.  Their performance and design specifications were developed following detailed engineering appraisal and market research involving prototype trains which ran on the Jubilee Line.
<BR>
<BR>Major features of these new trains are the smoother ride, acceleration and braking, an air suspension system, higher speeds, wider externally-mounted passenger-operated doors, brighter material design with large windows in the ends of cars, longer trains for increased capacity, new passenger-to-driver emergency communication facilities, automatic audible station announcements and closed-circuit television in the new-style cab to allow operators to monitor what is happening on platforms.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CENTRAL LINE DEPTS</B></font>
<BR>The overhaul of trains takes place at a large dept at West Ruislip.  Train maintenance work is also carried out at this dept as well as at Hainault dept.  A smaller dept at White City is used to stable trains at night.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CENTRAL LINE MODERNISATION</B></font>
<BR>In 1988 the Government gave the go-ahead for a modernisation scheme, involving not only the new fleet of trains but also a new high-tech signalling system for the line directed by a new computer-based control centre in central London.
<BR>
<BR>The simultaneous renewal of trains and signalling - and other equipment - will make the best use of the Central Line's capacity and provide important benefits for customers with more frequent trains, greater comfort, shorter journeys and improved reliability.  The 750 million modernisation will be completed by the end of 1996.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>CENTRAL LINE TRIVIA</B></font>
<UL>
<LI>The longest journey without change on the London Underground can be made on the Central Line between West Ruislip and Epping (55 km, 34.1 miles).
<BR>
<BR><LI>Chancery Lane Station has the shortest escalator on the system, with just 50 steps.
<BR>
<BR><LI>At Greenford Station, the escalators go up to the trains.
<BR></UL>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE WATERLOO &amp; CITY LINE</B></font>
<BR>The Waterloo &amp; City, London's second deep-level tube railway, opened in 1898.  It was promoted by the London and South Western Railway whose trains terminated at Waterloo and was intended then as now to offer commuters a direct rail link to and from the City of London.  The line remained under separate management from the London Underground for almost 100 years, but on 1st April 1994 London Underground took over the line from British Rail.
<BR>
<BR>The 2.25 km (1.38 mile) line links Waterloo with Bank without any intermediate stations, and is operated by the Central Line management team. The new trains on the line are of identical design to those on the Central Line.

<p>The Circle and the Hammersmith &amp; City Lines are two of London's busiest in-town Underground lines.  Together they carry 114 million passengers a year (69 million on the Circle and 45 million on the Hammersmith &amp; City), and 30 trains (14 on the Circle and 16 on the Hammersmith &amp; City) run during peak periods.
<BR>
<BR>The Hammersmith &amp; City Line serves 19 stations (28 in peak periods) and runs from Hammersmith via Paddington, Baker Street, King's Cross and Liverpool Street to Whitechapel, with a peak periods extension to Barking, a total distance of 26.5 km (16.5 miles).
<BR>
<BR>The Circle Line shares almost all of its 22.5 km (14 mile) route with three other lines, the Hammersmith &amp; City, the Metropolitan and the District.  It serves many of London's principal main line railway stations and provides useful connections with other rail and Underground services.  Taking its starting point as Baker Street, it runs via King's Cross, Liverpool Street, Aldgate, Tower Hill, Cannon Street, Blackfriars, Embankment, Victoria, South Kensington, Paddington and Edgware Road, with half the service running anti-clockwise in the reverse direction.  In all, the Circle Line serves 27 stations.  The busiest station is Victoria (also served by District Line and Victoria Line trains) which was used by an estimated 77 million passengers in 1994.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>The two lines run over some of the oldest sections of the London Underground system, including the world's very first Underground railway, the 5.6 km (3.5 miles) between Paddington and Farringdon, which opened as the Metropolitan Railway on 10th January 1863.
<BR>
<BR>In June the following year, the Metropolitan Railway was extended from Paddington to Hammersmith with intermediate stations at Shepherd's Bush and Ladbroke Grove, which was then known as Notting Hill Gate.  The original Shepherd's Bush Station was closed in 1914 and replaced by the present building in Uxbridge Road.  The other stations on this section opened later - Westbourne Park (1866), Latimer Road (1868), Royal Oak (1871), White City/Wood Lane (1908, closed 1959) and Goldhawk Road (1914).
<BR>
<BR>To the east, the line was extended from Farringdon to Moorgate in 1865, and to Liverpool Street in 1875.  It reached Aldgate the following year and Whitechapel in 1884.
The rest of the story is closely connected with another of London's early Underground railways, the District, which opened its first section in 1868 between South Kensington and Westminster.  The District grew in stages between then and 1905 and in the process, sowed the seeds of the Circle Line.  The Circle was introduced as a result of co-operation between the Metropolitan and District companies.  With the opening of a link between Aldgate and Tower Hill in 1884, it was then physically possible for trains to travel in a circle by using both Metropolitan and District tracks.  The Hammersmith to Whitechapel service of the Metropolitan Line was extended to Barking in 1936.
<BR>
<BR>In the early days, the trains were hauled by steam locomotives, which naturally posed ventilation problems.  So, in addition to the ventilation shafts placed at frequent intervals along the tunnels, the engines were specially equipped to turn most of the spent steam back into water.  By 1905, both lines had been electrified.
<BR>
<BR>The Circle and the Hammersmith &amp; City Lines have traditionally been operated as part of the Metropolitan Line, but from 1988 until March 1996 they were managed as a joint Business Unit, separate from the Metropolitan.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE LINES</B></font>
<BR>London Underground's headquarters are at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  There are a number of General Managers with their own headquarters staff controlling daily operations on either a single line or a group of lines.
<BR>
<BR>General Manager for the Metropolitan and Circle Lines (covering the Metropolitan Line, the Circle Line and and the Hammersmith &amp; City Line) is Charles Horton.  His management team includes Engineering Development Manager, Paul Vellacott; Train Service Delivery Manager, Circle, Mike Brown; Station Service Delivery Manager, Ron Dellaway; Business Delivery and Finance Manager, John Ferguson; and Safety and Environmental Adviser, Harry Burgess-Wall.
<BR>
<BR>The Circle Line and Hammersmith &amp; City Line stations which are the direct responsibility of this team are Hammersmith, Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush, Latimer Road, Ladbroke Grove, Westbourne Park, Royal Oak, Paddington (the busiest, with 24 million passengers a year), Bayswater and Edgware Road.
<BR>
<BR>There are 500 staff, working in managerial functions, on stations, in depts, in signal cabins and on the trains.  The total includes 168 train operators, 200 station staff and 70 dept staff.
<BR>
<BR>The trains which run on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines are known as C stock.  They were built in two batches, in 1969 and 1977, and were refurbished from 1992.  They run as six-car trains when in service.  The line also provides the trains which run on the Edgware Road to Wimbledon section of the District Line.
<BR>
<BR>The principal dept for the lines is at Hammersmith, but there are several minor depts and sidings in other places such as Barking, Triangle Sidings (in Kensington) and Farringdon.  In July 1993 a new train crew dept was opened at Edgware Road.  This provides better control of train operator deployment and offers up-to-date staff facilities.
<BR>
<BR>In October 1991 a 3.4 million security initiative was launched on the western end of the Hammersmith &amp; City Line.  Staff in a specially equipped control room at Ladbroke Grove Station can constantly monitor main areas of the eight stations between Hammersmith and Paddington using closed-circuit television.  Special Help Points at key locations allow passengers requiring urgent help or information to speak directly to control room staff.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>The first section of what is now the District Line opened on Christmas Eve 1868 between South Kensington and Westminster as the Metropolitan District Railway, the second company to start operating underground railway services in London.  The District (as the railway became known) built the southern section of the present day Circle Line, the final link of which was completed in 1884.  This project included an extension to Whitechapel and a triangular junction between Aldgate East and the Tower.  In this way, the history of the District Line is inextricably linked with that of the Circle.
<BR>
<BR>By 1884, the District had already been involved in the construction or operation of extensions radiating from what was to become the Circle Line.  In 1869 it started operating a line between Gloucester Road and West Brompton and also put in a connection between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington.  Parallel to those of the Metropolitan Railway, the District built its own pair of tracks between Gloucester Road and South Kensington.  The District reached Hammersmith in 1874, Richmond in 1877 and Ealing Broadway two years later.  In 1883 a short-lived extension was made to Windsor from Ealing Broadway, over the route of the Great Western Railway.  This service was withdrawn in 1885.  In 1902 the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway - worked by the District - opened, allowing trains to run through to Upminster.  Further extensions to Hounslow and Uxbridge were served wholly by Piccadilly services from 1964 and 1933 respectively, and the most recent extension was added just after the war and still runs to Olympia.
<BR>
<BR>The District has always been closely associated with the operation of other railways, and in its time has run services not just  to Windsor but also to Southend.  When Railtrack was set up in 1994, the District Line took over all the infrastructure of the line from Putney Bridge to Wimbledon including East Putney, Southfields and Wimbledon Park stations.  The Richmond branch of the line continues to be a joint operation with North London Railways over tracks between Gunnersbury and Richmond for which Railtrack is now responsible.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE DISTRICT LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  There area number of General Managers with their own headquarters staff responsible for the operation of either a single line or a group of lines.  In charge of the District Line is General Manager, Ann Blackburn.  Line Engineering Manager, Bob Piggott, is responsible for ensuring that the line's engineering facilities - trains, track, signalling, control systems and material supplies - are technically and mechanically safe and reliable and maintained to a high quality.  The 44 stations managed by the line are the responsibility of the Business Manager, Nigel Paget, and Fleet Manager, John Batchelor is responsible for maintaining the fleet of D stock trains at the line's two depts at Ealing Common and Upminster.  Ealing Common also overhauls the trains and accommodates part of the fleet of engineers' vehicles needed for essential maintenance work throughout the Underground system.  The operation of the service is the responsibility of the Train Service Manager, Malcolm Dean.  He is responsible for the train crews and train service control staff who ensure that the advertised service is maintained and that, should an incident occur, recovery is swift.
<BR>
<BR>The District is one of the most complex of all the Underground lines to operate, with a single route eastwards to Upminster but to the west three branches to Wimbledon, Ealing and Richmond.  The main central London tracks also accommodate the southern section of the Circle Line.  Additionally, there is a separate Wimbledon/Putney Bridge service to Edgware Road and a branch to Olympia.  All of these services pass through Earl's Court, which is the operational hub of the line and the location of the control centre, from where the Piccadilly Line is also controlled.  The District Line carries around 182 million people a year, making it the Underground's best used line.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRAINS</B></font>
<BR>The District Line covers 64 km (40 miles) and serves 60 stations, 44 of which are managed by the District Line team.  66 trains are required to operate the full morning and evening peak period services on the main section of the line, with an additional ten operating the Edgware Road branch.
<BR>
<BR>Two types of train operate District Line services.  The main service uses D stock, which entered service between 1979 and 1983, while the Edgware Road and Olympia branches are served by C stock trains, (which also run on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines), purchased in two batches in 1969 and 1977.  The C stock is maintained at the Circle's Hammersmith dept.
<p>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>STATIONS</B></font>
<BR>The District Line's stations reflect its long and varied history, with a wide range of architectural styles and including some which, such as Barons Court, have been listed as buildings of especial interest.  Contrasting with the District Railway's early overall-roofed stations at West Brompton and Fulham Broadway are the ex-London, Tilbury and Southend Railway stations at Plaistow and East Ham with their ornately monogrammed canopy ironwork. Ex-London and South Western Railway cottage-style stations at Wimbledon Park and Southfields are similarly distinct from the classic 1930s Charles Holden station at Chiswick Park (also listed).  Hammersmith Station's platforms and circulating areas have recently been completely updated in contemporary style.
<BR>The busiest station managed by the District Line is Embankment (also served by Bakerloo and Northern Line trains) with 36 million passengers a year.  At the opposite end of the scale is Upney with just 1.3 million.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FUTURE OF THE DISTRICT LINE</B></font>
<BR>The District Line has some of the oldest infrastructure on the Underground.  Maintaining and upgrading the track, structures and signalling to enable operation of a train service appropriate to the 21st century poses a major challenge.  Whilst every effort is made to minimise disruption, weekend closures are sometimes unavoidable so that major engineering work can be undertaken.  Such work is vital to ensure improved service reliability in the future.
<BR>
<BR>Mid-life upgrading of the D stock trains is planned to start in the next few years, together with a rolling programme of station refurbishments to improve the passenger environment and the range of facilities provided.  These especially include improved passenger information.
<BR>
<BR>Services are also being reviewed and a number of options are currently being evaluated.  Proposals for a Chelsea-Hackney Line would affect services on the Wimbledon branch, and to the east the Jubilee Line Extension project includes an upgrading of the existing interchange at West Ham.  As part of the same project Westminster station is being substantially enlarged to house a new ticket hall and escalators to serve both the District and Jubilee Lines.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>Today's East London Line has its roots in 1869, when Sir Marc Brunel's historic twin tunnels under the Thames, opened for pedestrians in 1843, were laid with tracks linking Wapping to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway at New Cross Gate.  Opened as the East London Railway on 7th December 1869, the line was extended from Wapping to provide a link with the Great Eastern Railway just outside Liverpool Street in 1876.  Four years later, a branch was opened from Surrey Docks to New Cross, providing the configuration now to be found at the line's southern end.  The section beyond Shoreditch was closed when the line was electrified in 1913 and the section between Shoreditch and New Cross/New Cross Gate was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway.  The East London Line was operated and managed as part of the Metropolitan until the end of 1988, when it came under separate management as part of organisational changes system-wide.  In September 1991 its management was merged with that of the Jubilee Line.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE EAST LONDON LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  Each line has a General Manager and its own headquarters staff responsible for management, day-to-day operation and development of services and facilities.
<BR>
<BR>In charge of the East London Line is General Manager, John Self, assisted by Line Engineering Manager, Brian Raven, who is responsible for ensuring the line's engineering facilities - trains, track, signalling and control systems - are technically and mechanically fit and reliable and maintained to a high quality.  Business Manager, Ron Delaney, is responsible for station management, and Train Service Manager, Howard Collins, controls the operation of the line's trains.  The management team is also responsible for the Jubilee Line.
<BR>
<BR>Day-to-day management of the six stations managed by the East London Line is the responsibility of Mike Bull, the Group Station Manager, who is located at Surrey Quays.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PASSENGERS</B></font>
<BR>The line experienced enormous growth in passenger numbers during the 1980s, due largely to regeneration and economic growth in Docklands, and now carries some eight million people a year.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRAINS AND STATIONS</B></font>
<BR>The line covers 8 km (5 miles) and provides train services at eight stations, six of which the line manages - Shoreditch, Whitechapel, Shadwell, Wapping, Rotherhithe and Surrey Quays.  New Cross and New Cross Gate are managed by Railtrack.  Normally running between Whitechapel and New Cross/New Cross Gate, the service is extended northwards to serve Shoreditch at peak times and on Sunday mornings (for Brick Lane market).  Five trains are required to operate the full morning and evening peak services.
<BR>
<BR>The line has seen many different types of rolling stock over the years, including 1938 tube stock between 1974 and 1977.  The line currently has its own dedicated fleet of A stock trains, painted in a bright and distinctive livery with graffiti-resistant paint - the first line to have all its trains treated in this way.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE FUTURE OF THE EAST LONDON LINE</B></font>
<BR>For many years, the East London Line had a somewhat ambiguous status as a separate but not altogether autonomous part of the Metropolitan Line.  In many ways, it was the poor relation of the Underground, tucked away in a declining and unglamorous part of London.  However, the enormous growth in passenger numbers over recent years, due largely to developing economic activity in Docklands, reflects the fact that the East London Line is becoming an important transport link in the East London and Docklands areas between the north and south of the Thames.  The line now requires special attention in terms of resources and a major package of improvements and initiatives is being developed.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>EXTENSIONS</B></font>
<BR>Two extensions, south to East Dulwich via Peckham Rye and north to Dalston and Highbury &amp; Islington, are planned.  Preliminary studies showed there is a strong case for both extensions.  The proposals include bringing much currently disused trackbed back into service.
<BR>
<BR>A formal application to seek the necessary powers under the Transport and Works Act to build the northern extension was made in December 1993.  A public enquiry was held in the autumn of 1994, and the Secretary of State'for Transport's decision is expected shortly.  A separate application to seek powers to build the southern extension will be made at a later date.
<BR>
<BR>As part of the northern extension a new station will be built at Bishopsgate, located 0.25 mile (400 metres) away from Shoreditch station, on the former Bishopsgate goods yard site.  A formal application to close Shoreditch station is under way but during the time between the closure of Shoreditch and the opening of the new Bishopsgate station, a special replacement bus service will operate between Whitechapel and Shoreditch stations on the same days and during the same hours as the train service runs at present.
<BR>
<BR>At Canada Water, where the Jubilee Line extension will cross the East London Line, a new station providing interchange between both lines will be built.  Parliamentary powers for the station were granted as part of the London Underground Act (1992) for the extension of the Jubilee Line, and it is hoped the station will open in 1997.
<BR>
<BR>The East London Line closed from March 1995 for the construction of the new Jubilee Line extension station at Canada Water and for flood mitigation work.  The major engineering and improvement projects, which will include the lining of the tunnel between Wapping and Rotherhithe to reduce water seepage, resignalling of the line and track improvements, will cost about 55 million.  During the temporary closure frequent substitute bus services are running.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<br>The Jubilee Line is London Underground's youngest line, having opened on 1st May 1979 between Charing Cross and Stanmore.   It was formed of two sections:  a new line, four km (two and a half miles) long, in twin tunnels between Baker Street and Charing Cross; and the former Bakerloo Line branch between Baker Street and Stanmore.
<BR>
<BR>The 7.25 km (four and half mile) branch from Wembley Park to Stanmore was originally part of the Metropolitan Line, and opened in 1932.   It became part of the Bakerloo Line in 1939 when the London Passenger Transport Board opened a new section of tube tunnel between Baker Street and Finchley Road, permitting a through Bakerloo service to Stanmore.   The alignment between Finchley Road and Wembley Park was part of the original Metropolitan Railway which was extended through Wembley to Harrow-on-the-Hill in 1880.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE JUBILEE LINE</B></font>
<br>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  Each line has a General Manager and its own headquarters staff controlling daily operations.
<BR>
<br>In charge of the Jubilee Line is General Manager, John Self, assisted by Line Engineering Manager, Brian Raven, who is responsible for ensuring the line's engineering facilities - trains, track, signalling and control systems - are technically and mechanically fit and reliable and maintained to a high quality.  Business Manager, Ron Delaney, manages the line's stations from St John's Wood to Stanmore, and Train Service Manager, Howard Collins, controls the operation of the line's trains.
<BR>
<br>Train services on the Jubilee and Metropolitan Lines are monitored and controlled by a signalling control centre at Baker Street which is equipped with the latest computer technology. The management team is also responsible for the East London Line.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRAINS AND STATIONS</B></font>
<br>Twenty four trains are required to operate the full morning and evening peak period service.  The six-car trains are formed of 1983 tube stock with its distinctive feature of push-button doors which passengers can operate themselves.   Jubilee Line trains have a single crew member - the train operator - who drives and also oversees the opening and closing of the doors.
<br>
<br>The Jubilee Line, which currently carries 56 million passengers a year, covers 22.5 km (14 miles) and serves 17 stations.  The 13 stations from St John's Wood to Stanmore inclusive are managed by the Jubilee Line management team.  The four central London interchange stations are managed by other lines.
<BR>
<br>The ancestry of the Jubilee Line shows in the varied station architecture, ranging from the bright and cheerful late 1970s tube style (platform level) at Baker Street and south to Charing Cross, through late 1930s at Kilburn and Dollis Hill, early 1930s Metropolitan suburban at Kingsbury, Canons Park and Stanmore, to 1920s Metropolitan urban at Willesden Green and 1880 Metropolitan rural at Neasden.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DEPTS AND SIDINGS</B></font>
<br>Jubilee Line trains are maintained at the Metropolitan Line's main dept at Neasden.   There are sidings for stabling trains at Stanmore and reversing sidings are provided at West Hampstead, Willesden Green and Wembley Park.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>JUBILEE LINE EXTENSION</B></font>
<br>In November 1989 the Government authorised London Underground to deposit a Bill before Parliament to extend the Jubilee Line from Green Park to Stratford.  Royal Assent to the Bill was obtained in March 1992 and the 1.9 billion project (at 1993 prices), putting the developing Docklands area on the Underground map, was given the formal go-ahead by the Secretary of State for Transport in October 1993.  Construction began in December that year and will take 53 months, with the extension opening in 1998.
<BR>
<br>Government consultants recommended the Jubilee Line Extension in the East London Rail study published in 1989.   The Government also secured an undertaking for a significant private sector contribution towards the cost of the project from major developers in Docklands.
<BR>
<br>The extension will run in twin-tube tunnels, south from Green Park, via Westminster and Waterloo to London Bridge.   Continuing eastwards, it will serve Docklands and then after coming to the surface at Canning Town will run north to Stratford following the existing North London Railways route.
<br>
<br>All Jubilee Line trains will follow the new alignment, but the existing section between Green Park and Charing Cross will be retained for emergency use or for special services.
<BR>
<br>The new section will be 16 km (10 miles) long, making the extended Jubilee Line from Stanmore to Stratford 36 km (22.5 miles) long.   A completely new fleet of trains trains will be required to provide services on the line, and there will be a new dept on the Stratford Market site although routine engineering work will continue to be done at Neasden.
<BR>
<br>From Green Park, there will be stations at Westminster, Waterloo, Southwark, London Bridge, Bermondsey, Canada Water, Canary Wharf, North Greenwich, Canning Town, West Ham and Stratford.
<BR>
<br>The Prime Minister, the Rt Hon John Major  MP, drove the first pile of the extension at a start-of-work ceremony at Canary Wharf on Wednesday 8th December 1993.
<BR>
<br>When the Heathrow Express tunnel collapsed in October 1994, London Underground decided to suspend work at the Waterloo and London Bridge sites, where the same New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) was being used.  However, after extensive tests had been carried out on the NATM work already constructed, the Health &amp; Safety Executive advised London Underground that, subject to specified conditions, there was no objection to restarting work involving the construction of running tunnels at Waterloo and London Bridge in January 1995.  The suspension of work only affected two of the 36 sites on the project, so the extension is still scheduled to open on time in the spring of 1998.
<BR>
<br>The line will bring many benefits with dramatically reduced journey times and useful interchange facilities with existing Underground lines and other rail lines including the Docklands Light Railway.

Although it is renowned as the descendant of the world's first Underground railway, only 9.7km (six miles) out of the Metropolitan Line's 67 km (41 miles) are actually under ground.  This makes what is often popularly known as the Met more like a suburban railway than a typical part of the London Underground.
<BR>
<BR>The Metropolitan Line runs from Aldgate and Baker Street via Finchley Road and Wembley Park to Harrow-on-the-Hill, where the branch to Uxbridge separates.  From Harrow, the line proceeds north to Moor Park and splits again, with one branch going to Watford and the other continuing on to Amersham via Rickmansworth.  A single track branch to Chesham joins the Amersham line at Chalfont and Latimer.  Trains on the Amersham service usually run non-stop between Finchley Road/Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park.
<BR>
<BR>In all, the Met serves 34 stations, the busiest being King's Cross (also served by Circle, Hammermith &amp; City, Piccadilly and Victoria Line trains) which was used by an estimated 63 million passengers in 1994.  The line currently has 42 trains operating at peak periods.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>The Metropolitan Railway opened the world's first Underground railway service on 10th January 1863 between Bishop's Road, Paddington and Farringdon Street.  In 1865, the line was extended to Moorgate, and reached Liverpool Street in 1875 and Aldgate the following year.  A weekly ticket, which could be purchased on Mondays only, cost the princely sum of one shilling (five pence).
<BR>
<BR>In 1868, the St John's Wood Railway Company opened a line from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage.  That Company had amalgamated with the Metropolitan by 1879 when the line was extended to Willesden Green, reaching Harrow-on-the-Hill in 1880.  The next extensions were to Pinner 1885, Rickmansworth in 1887 and Chesham in 1889.  Finally, in 1892, the main line reached Aylesbury.
<BR>
<BR>In 1904, the branch from Harrow-on-the-Hill to Uxbridge opened, but another 21 years elapsed before the Met expanded its system further.  This was the extension from Moor Park via Croxley to Watford which opened in 1925.
<BR>
<BR>In 1932, the Metropolitan opened a new section from Wembley Park to Stanmore, but after only seven years this became part of the Bakerloo Line.  At the same time, the Bakerloo Line was extended from Baker Street to Finchley Road and took over the Metropolitan stopping service between there and Wembley Park.  After this, all Metropolitan Line trains ran non-stop from Finchley Road to Wembley Park.
<BR>
<BR>The line from Harrow-on-the-Hill to Moor Park was double-tracked in 1962, to allow some trains to operate non-stop between these stations, speeding the service for longer-distance passengers.
<BR>
<BR>The Metropolitan Railway's original steam-hauled trains gradually succumbed to electric traction.  Electric trains ran from Baker Street to Uxbridge from 1905 and to Rickmansworth from 1925.  The Watford branch was electrified from the outset,  but steam survived on the Met north of Rickmansworth until 1961 when the line was electrified to Amersham and Chesham and the service beyond Amersham taken over by British Rail.  However, steam-hauled trains still run on the Met at special annual events, usually held in May or June, when the general public can enjoy the exhilaration of travelling behind a steam engine as it tackles the gradients of the Chilterns.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE METROPOLITAN LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  There are a number of General Managers with their own headquarters staff controlling daily operations on either a single line or a group of lines.
<BR>
<BR>General Manager of the Metropolitan and Circle Lines (covering the Metropolitan Line, the Circle Line and the Hammersmith &amp; City Line) is Charles Horton.  His management team includes:
<BR><UL>
<BR><LI>Engineering Development Manager, Paul Vellacott, who ensures the engineering facilities - trains, track, signalling and control systems - are technically and mechanically fit and reliable and maintained to a high quality.
<BR>
<BR><LI>Train Service Delivery Manager (Metropolitan), Dennis Watson, who supervises the operation of the train service.
Station Service Delivery Manager, Ron Dellaway, who is responsible for station facilities and for ticket issuing and checking.
<BR>
<BR><LI>Business Development and Finance Manager, John Ferguson, who is responsible for planning and developing improved services and facilities.
<BR>
<BR><LI>Safety &amp; Environmental Adviser, Harry Burgess-Wall, who advises on and monitors all aspects of safety and affecting both customers and employees.
<BR></UL>
<BR>Train services on part of the Metropolitan Line and all of the Jubilee Line are monitored and controlled by a computerised signalling control centre at Baker Street.  All routes north of Wembley Park are controlled from local signal cabins, as is the in-town section but work is currently under way to extend the computerised control through from Baker Street to Aldgate.
<p>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>ROLLING STOCK</B></font>
<BR>The trains which run on the Metropolitan Line are known as A stock.  They were built in two batches between 1960 and 1962 and run as eight-car trains, except on the Chesham shuttle which uses a four-car unit.
<BR>A refurbishment programme is now under way on the 56  trains, and is due for completion in the summer of 1997.  The trains will be cleaner and brighter with a number of technical modifications.  The work is being carried out at the ABB works in Derby.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>DEPTS</B></font>
<BR>The main dept for the line is Neasden, but there are several other minor depts and sidings, including Wembley Park, Uxbridge and Rickmansworth.  Neasden dept is also responsible for maintaining Jubilee Line and some Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City Lines trains.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>The Northern Line has its roots in two pioneering railways: the 5.25 km (3.25 mile) City and South London Railway - the world's first electric deep-level tube line - which opened in 1890 and ran from King William Street in the City to Stockwell; and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, which opened in 1907.
<BR>
<BR>Between 1922 and 1926, the City and South London Railway was rebuilt and linked with the Hampstead Railway at Camden Town, with extensions to Hendon Central (1923), Edgware (1924) and Morden (1926).
<BR>
<BR>The line, renamed the Northern Line in 1937, was further extended between Archway and East Finchley in 1939, on to High Barnet in 1940, and finally to Mill Hill East in 1941.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE NORTHERN LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  Each line has a General Manager and its own headquarters staff controlling daily operations.
<BR>
<BR>In charge of the Northern Line is General Manager, Wilben Short, with Cy Porter as Line Engineering Manager.  Managing the operation of the line is Train Service Manager, David Millard, with Business Manager, Kevin Hafter, responsible for the operation and revenue of the line's 41 stations.  Former Northern Line Fleet Manager, Keith Paynter, who continues to be responsible for ensuring that the maximum number of trains is available for service, now carries out this duty with his staff for GEC-Alsthom under a special leasing deal (see Improving the Northern Line, below).  82 trains are required to run the peak service every day.  Two types of train are operated on the line - 1959/1962 tube stock and 1972 Mark One tube stock - both manufactured by Metro-Cammell of Birmingham.
<BR>
<BR>Three depts are used to overhaul and maintain Northern Line trains.  The largest dept is at Morden while most maintenance and overhaul work is performed at Golders Green.  The third dept is at Highgate.  Additional sidings at Edgware and High Barnet are used to stable trains overnight.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>IMPROVING THE NORTHERN LINE</B></font>
<BR>Plans to modernise the Northern Line, which include new trains and a state-of-the-art signalling system, have taken a significant step forward with the announcement in November 1994 of a deal with the Anglo-French company, GEC Alsthom, to lease 106 new trains.  Delivery is scheduled to begin by the end  of 1996, with a new signalling and control system being installed towards the end of the decade.
<BR>
<BR>Major expansion schemes at London Bridge and Tottenham Court Road are planned.  Work has already started at London Bridge in order to provide interchange with the Jubilee Line Extension and improved facilities for customers throughout the station.  At Angel station, 70 million has been spent on building a new larger station with two separate platforms instead of the former single island platform, escalators to replace the lifts and a new, larger booking hall in Islington High Street.
<BR>
<BR>Work has started on refurbishing ten Northern Line stations south of Kennington, including Oval, Clapham North, Clapham Common, Clapham South, Balham, Tooting Bec, Tooting Broadway, Colliers Wood, South Wimbledon and Morden.  The 60 million project will be completed by 1998.  Six Northern Line stations (Clapham North to Tooting Broadway) have been the test-bed for new anti-crime measures.  Help Points and information booths have been installed, in addition to improved lighting, extra closed-circuit TV cameras and additional passageway mirrors.  This equipment is being upgraded over the next three years.
<BR>
<BR>Close working with the local British Transport Police Home Beat Officers has also led to greater security for passengers and staff and a marked decrease in the level of crime.  The crime prevention schemes have been very successful and have since been adopted on other lines.

<BR>The Northern Line holds a variety of records for the Underground:
<UL>
<BR><LI>Hampstead has the deepest lift shaft, 55.2m (181 ft), and is the deepest station below ground level, 58.2m (192 ft)
<BR>
<BR><LI>Chalk Farm has the shallowest lift shaft, 9.3m (30 ft 6in)
<BR>
<BR><LI>Angel station has the longest escalators in western Europe.  The 60 m (197 ft) long escalators take 80 seconds to carry customers up and down the 27.5 m (90 ft) drop
<BR>
<BR><LI>Morden is the most southerly point served by the Underground, 16km (10 miles) from central London
<BR>
<BR><LI>The tunnel between East Finchley and Morden (via Bank) is the Underground's longest and  one of the longest rail tunnels in the world, 27.8km (17.25 miles)
<BR>
<BR><LI>The Dollis Brook viaduct over Dollis Road on the Mill Hill East branch is the highest point above ground level on the Underground, 18m (60 ft)
<BR>
<BR><LI>The Underground's deepest point below ground level is at Holly Bush Hill, Hampstead, 67.4m (221 ft)
<BR>
<BR><LI>The Underground's deepest point below mean sea level is just south of Waterloo station, 21.3m (70 ft)

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<BR>The Piccadilly Line owes its beginning to one of the great pioneers of tube railways, the American entrepreneur, Charles Tyson Yerkes.  The original line, which was opened on 15th December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, consisted of 15.3 km (nine and a half mile) twin tunnels from Finsbury Park to Barons Court and a short section of surface track on to Hammersmith.  A branch to Aldwych opened the following year.
<BR>
<BR>No major developments took place on the Piccadilly until the early 1930s when it grew rapidly.  The extensions to South Harrow and Arnos Grove were opened in 1932 and those to Hounslow West, Uxbridge and Cockfosters were completed in 1933.
<BR>
<BR>In more recent years, the Piccadilly Line was extended west from Hounslow West to serve Hatton Cross (1975) and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 (1977).  In 1986, the Heathrow terminal was developed into a loop which also serves Terminal 4.
<BR>
<BR>A peak-period shuttle service operated between Holborn and Aldwych until its closure on 30th September 1994.  The service had been suffering from falling passenger numbers and a 7 million investment would have been needed to bring the station and track up to modern safety standards.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE PICCADILLY LINE</B></font>
<BR>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  Each line has a General Manager and its own headquarters staff controlling daily operations.
<BR>
<BR>In charge of the Piccadilly Line is General Manager, Bob Bayman, assisted by Line Engineering Manager, Roger Bennison, who is responsible for ensuring that the line's engineering facilities - trains, track, signalling, control systems and material supplies - are technically and mechanically fit and reliable and maintained to a high quality.  Andy Barr is the line's Business Manager, responsible for managing the 34 stations which are owned by  the Piccadilly Line.  Train Service Manager, David Ursell, controls the operation of the line's trains.
<BR>
<BR>The Piccadilly Line's train service is monitored and controlled by the signalling control centre at Earl's Court.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRAINS AND STATIONS</B></font>
<BR>The Piccadilly Line covers 71 km (44.3 miles) and serves 52 stations from Cockfosters to Heathrow and Uxbridge.  72 trains are required to operate the morning and evening peak period service.
<BR>
<BR>Piccadilly Line trains are formed of 1973 tube stock and operate in six-car formations.  The trains have space by the doors to accommodate luggage for the many passengers travelling to and from Heathrow Airport.  They are serviced and cleaned in depts at Northfields and Cockfosters, and there are also sidings for stabling trains at South Harrow and Arnos Grove.
<BR>
<BR>The Piccadilly Line was the first of the deep-level tube lines to be converted to one-person operation, where the operator drives the train and controls the operation of the doors.  The trains will be refurbished in a major programme during the period 1996-1999.
<BR>
<BR>Piccadilly Line stations show a variety of architectural styles reflecting the line's history.  Of particular note are the 1930s stations of Charles Holden.  Many of these designs, such as Southgate, Arnos Grove and Sudbury Town, are now highly regarded as examples of the best public architecture of the period and are listed buildings.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTERESTING FEATURES</B></font>
<BR>The line holds one notable record for the London Underground system: the shortest distance between adjacent stations by rail is the 0.26 km (0.16 miles) between Leicester Square and Covent Garden.
<BR>
<BR>There are four tracks between Northfields and Acton Town, and one of the two westbound tracks is fitted with water sprays for train braking and wheel adhesion trials.
<BR>
<BR>Piccadilly Line trains run non-stop from Acton Town to Hammersmith at most times.
<BR>
<BR>Between Hammersmith and Barons Court there is a double-ended siding which can be used to reverse eastbound or westbound trains.  The Piccadilly twin-tube tunnels commence just east of Barons Court and the line remains in tunnel until Arnos Grove.  There are reversing sidings underground at Hyde Park Corner and at Wood Green.  Southgate station is in a short separate tunnel section, as is the line beyond Hounslow West serving Hatton Cross, Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 and Heathrow Terminal 4 stations (except for a short section on the surface between Hounslow west and Hatton Cross where the line crosses the River Crane).
<BR>

<BR>There are four disused stations on the line, some parts of which can be glimpsed as trains pass through.  They are:

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>HISTORY</B></font>
<br>The Victoria Line - the first central London tube line to be built since the "tube boom" of the early 1900s - links Walthamstow in north east London with Brixton in south London.
<BR>
<br>The line opened in stages between 1968 and 1971 (listed at the end of this Fact Sheet), penetrating previously "tubeless" areas of north and south London.  The line serves four main line railway stations (Victoria, Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross).  In addition to crossing the very heart of London's West End, it passes through London's three busiest Underground stations, Victoria, Oxford Circus and King's Cross.
<BR>
<br>The line's origins can be traced back to the Second World War when it was included in the 1943 County of London Plan.  The constraints of the war years and subsequent re-organisation and nationalisation of London's transport caused the plan to be postponed, and Parliamentary Powers to build the line were not obtained until 1955.  Further delays in obtaining funds meant that actual construction work did not start until 1962.
<BR>
<br>Conceived originally to relieve congestion on existing Underground and suburban railway routes, the Victoria Line quickly established new markets of its own and today carries nearly three times more people than originally envisaged.  Brixton alone today caters for over 15 million people per year - more than twice the original estimate.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>RUNNING THE VICTORIA LINE</B></font>
<br>London Underground Limited is based at 55 Broadway in Westminster.  Each line has a General Manager and its own headquarters staff controlling daily operations.  Some 730 staff are involved in the day-to-day operation and management of the Victoria Line.
<BR>
<br>In charge is General Manager, (vacancy).  Line Engineering Manager, Rob McNeil-Wilson, has responsibility for keeping the line's assets, such as trains, track and signalling equipment in good order.  He is assisted by Fleet Manager, Jeff Ellis; Infrastructure Manager, Steve Goodfellow; and Planning and Contracts Manager, Alan Platt.
<BR>
<br>Ron Hart, Train Service Manager, has responsibility for controlling the operation of the line's 43 trains, of which 35 are currently needed for service in the peak periods.  The fleet was designed for the opening of the line and is known as 1967 tube stock.
Each train has only one person in charge - the Train Operator - and once the doors are closed and the twin "start" buttons are pressed by the Operator, the trains run automatically to the next station, responding to coded impulses transmitted through the track.
<BR>
<br>Those trains not in service are either undergoing cleaning, maintenance or overhaul.  These activities are carried out at the Victoria Line dept at Northumberland Park, Tottenham.  This is the only part of the Victoria Line which is not below ground.  All the trains have recently been refurbished and have new, brighter lighting, better seating and an enhanced interior appearance using materials which meet the latest safety standards.  The train exteriors have been painted in a special bright new livery from which it is easy to remove graffiti.  A new washing machine has recently been installed to keep the trains looking good, as well as meeting the latest environmental standards.
<BR>
<br>Aidan Harris, Business Manager, has to ensure that Victoria Line stations are properly run, as well as being responsible for the collection and protection of revenue on the line.  Measures to protect revenue and reduce fraud are being enhanced all the time, and currently all stations north of King's Cross (except Finsbury Park) are in the process of being provided with the latest design of automatic ticket-checking exit and entry gates.  All the other stations on the line have had gates for some years.
<BR>
<br>The safe and secure operation of stations is equally important, and work is under way on the construction of a new security room at Brixton which will be able to monitor all the stations at the southern end of the line.  Work is also starting on the installation of a new control room at Seven Sisters in order to improve control of this busy station, especially the football crowds en route to and from Tottenham Hotspurs' matches.
<BR>
<br>At Victoria, the busiest station on the Underground, a 9 million congestion relief project is in progress providing an additional subway and staircase between the Victoria and the Circle and District Lines and replacing a staircase with a new escalator.  The project will be completed in 1997.
<BR>
<br>Some 139 million passenger journeys are made on the line each year.  The 21 km (13.25 mile) journey from Brixton to Walthamstow takes 32 minutes and trains run every two minutes during peak periods in each direction.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LOOKING AHEAD</B></font>
<br>Plans are now being developed to upgrade the Victoria Line to meet future predicted demand, especially from the new Channel Tunnel Rail Link which will terminate at St Pancras.  When completed, the Victoria Line upgrading should make it possible to run trains at intervals of one and a half minutes, and there will also be some minor extensions to the line.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</B></font>
<br>London was one of the first cities in Europe to experiment with horse trams when, in 1861, short lines were laid along Victoria Street and the Bayswater Road.  The experiment was unsuccessful because the rails projected above the level of the roadway, creating a hazard to other wheeled traffic. Horse cab drivers (whose trade was threatened) were particularly forceful in their opposition.  However, from 1870, horse tramways along rails sunk into the road surface spread rapidly into the new suburbs, providing cheap travel for the residents of these areas as far as, but for political and environmental reasons, never into central London.  A double-deck version of the horse-drawn tram was introduced soon afterwards.
<BR>
<br>The first electric trams made their appearance in 1901, and in 1903 the London County Council (LCC) embarked on a massive programme of new electric tram routes.  By 1914, the tramway network consisted of small municipally-run tram systems, such as those in West Ham and East Ham in east London; three tram companies (London United, Metropolitan Electric and South Metropolitan, each part of the Underground Group which also owned the General bus company and most of the Underground); and the large LCC system.  The Council-run systems were highly profitable, despite their low-fares policy, but the profits were not made available for investment in vehicles or track.  The Underground Group (the forerunner of London Transport) tended to give a higher priority to their bus and rail networks.
<BR>
<br>After London Transport was set up in 1933, it was considered more cost-effective gradually to replace the 2 500 trams with trolleybuses (and, after the 1939-45 war, with diesel-engined buses).  London's last conventional trams ran in 1952.
<BR>
<br>Since 1952, there has been a huge increase in the availability and use of private cars in London, and new roads and traffic management schemes have not kept pace with the potential demand. Public opposition has grown on environmental and social grounds to proposals for major road schemes through already built-up areas, which would in any case be hugely expensive.
<br>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE CURRENT POSITION</B></font>
<br>Today, in conurbations worldwide, buses are not perceived by passengers to be a reliable and high quality means of travel, mainly because of delays caused by traffic congestion.  Underground railways are extremely expensive and can only be justified where there is a prospect of large numbers of passengers being carried.  Alternative ways of meeting the need for a public transport system which is more reliable than the bus, but cheaper and quicker to build than underground railways, are now in operation around the world and, of these, modern tramway systems have become the most favoured.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FEATURES OF A MODERN TRAMWAY</B></font>
<br>What are sometimes known as "supertrams" use the latest technology and can run in single, articulated or linked units on tracks set beside or in the middle of streets, in pedestrian precincts or on their own private way.  A single articulated tram can carry up to 250 people - two and a half times the capacity of a typical bus - and is designed to be accessible to all sections of the community, including mothers with prams and small children, shoppers with trolleys, the elderly and people with disabilities. Compared with conventional trains, the stops are seldom more than 600 metres apart.  With segregated tracks and priority at traffic signals, there are no hold-ups in traffic jams, and the service is safe and reliable.
<BR>
<br>Many European cities already run trams on streets and through city centres.  Trams do not cause pollution in the street to damage the urban environment and the vehicles are extremely quiet with fast, smooth acceleration and quick and safe braking.  They can negotiate tight turns and climb steep gradients.  Tram systems can be designed to complement all urban surroundings, and this flexibility is increasingly attractive to town planners, who are turning to tramway technology to ease the problems of urban traffic congestion.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TRAM SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE</B></font>
<br>There are over 300 tram systems in operation thoughout the world, with approximately 40 new networks having been opened in the last ten years.  In the United Kingdom, the first section of Metrolink in Manchester started operation early in 1992.  The Sheffield Supertram system is now fully operational, and in Birmingham construction has begun on the first line of the extensive Midland Metro scheme.  Notable foreign tram systems include Amsterdam, Basle, Berlin, Grenoble, the Hague, Hannover, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nantes, San Diego and Zurich.
<br>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>LONDON TRANSPORT AND TRAMS</B></font>
<br>There are proposals for a number of modern tramway operations in this country, from Edinburgh in the north to the Portsmouth area in the south.  London Transport has been studying the development of tramways for a number of years, and now has a team dedicated to bringing the advantages of modern electric street transport to London.  The first major scheme to emerge is Croydon Tramlink.  This 29 km (18 mile) system will include extensive use of existing and disused railway tracks, as well as on-street running in the centre of Croydon.  Taking forward this project will be undertaken by the private sector, in line with Government policy, and a shortlist of four international consortia is now competing for the concession, to be awarded early in 1996, to design, fund, build and operate the system.  The system could be fully operational by the end of 1998 or early in 1999.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN LONDON</B></font>
<br>In June 1995, London Transport published "New Ideas for Public Transport in outer London" which set out the case for improved public transport facilities in over 40 areas, involving intermediate mode schemes which bridge the gap between heavy rail and conventional bus services.   In addition to light rail, these modes could include electrically-powered and alternative fuel vehicles; segregated and guided busways; and people-movers, such as monorails, magnetic levitation (maglev) or cable cars.   From these, nine have been selected for further study:

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>INTRODUCTION</B></font>
<BR>Croydon is the largest shopping and business centre in the south-east outside central London and is a commercial focal point for over a million people.  However, the rapid and successful expansion of the area has resulted in serious traffic congestion, with regular delays and limited facilities for car parking.  Business activity has recently shown a slight decline, and the local authority, the London Borough of Croydon, believes that congestion in the town centre could act as a disincentive to further commercial development.  In 1989, strong local opposition to the construction of new roads stimulated moves by London Transport and the Borough to look at trams as a viable alternative to attract people from their cars to public transport.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PROPOSALS FOR A TRAM NETWORK</B></font>
<BR>A study commissioned by London Transport (LT), British Rail (BR) and the London Borough of Croydon concluded in early 1990 that a modern tram system would be both feasible and practical for the Croydon area.  Public consultation was undertaken on the proposals - which became known as Tramlink - and 80% of respondents agreed that Tramlink was a "very good" or "good" initiative.
<BR>
<BR>The proposed 29 km (18 mile) Tramlink network will provide a direct rail link between East and West Croydon stations for the first time, and will additionally link central Croydon with Wimbledon, Elmers End, Beckenham and New Addington, the largest urban area in Greater London without a rail link.  Over 70% of the network will run over existing or disused railway tracks, and there will be 36 stops.  Sympathetic landscaping will ensure that Tramlink blends into the local environment.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE THREE ROUTES  (see map)</B></font>
<BR>
<BR><B>1	Wimbledon to East Croydon</B>
<BR>Trams will replace conventional trains over the existing railway line from Wimbledon to Wandle Park from where they will run along Tamworth Road to West Croydon, and then along Wellesley Road to East Croydon.
<BR>
<BR><B>2	East Croydon to Beckenham Junction and Elmers End</B>
<BR>The trams will run along Addiscombe Road and then follow the disused railway line north to Woodside.  Tramlink will serve the Croydon Sports Arena, and then run alongside the railway line between Birkbeck and Beckenham Junction.  A spur line will also serve Elmers End.
<BR>
<BR><B>3	East Croydon to New Addington</B>
<BR>The New Addington service will diverge from the Beckenham Junction route and use the disused trackbed of Woodside to Selsdon line south to Lloyd Park, from where there would be new, segregated, tram tracks to New Addington.
<BR>
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE TRAMS</B></font>
<BR>Tramlink's fleet of modern trams will consist of sleek, single-deck articulated vehicles, each capable of carrying over 200 people and powered from unobtrusive overhead cables.  They will be easily accessible to everyone, including the young, the old and the disabled, with level access for wheelchairs, children's pushchairs and shopping trolleys.  Feeder bus routes serving nearby residential areas will convey passengers to and from Tramlink stops.
<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE BENEFITS OF TRAMLINK</B></font>
<BR>A new modern tramway network in Croydon will offer an alternative and efficient form of public transport and encourage commuters to leave their cars at home.  With most journey times significantly cut, it is expected that many existing car users will switch to Tramlink and thereby ease congestion, reduce pollution and cut noise.  In the French city of Nantes, 40 000 fewer people used the roads when a modern tramway network was introduced.  With Tramlink, Croydon will be likely to attract more shoppers, and businesses will be able to recruit staff from a wider catchment area.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>COST</B></font>

<BR>The projected cost of constructing Tramlink is about 154 million, with a major proportion of this cost being met by private finance.  An assessment of the viability of Tramlink suggests that the system will more than cover its operating costs.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>PROJECT DEVELOPMENT GROUP</B></font>
<BR>In October 1992, three companies of international repute joined together with London Transport and the London Borough of Croydon to form the Project Development Group (PDG) to underwrite the next stage of development of the Tramlink scheme.  British civil engineers, Tarmac Construction, with German rolling stock manufacturers, AEG, and French tramway operators, Transdev, helped to bring the project to a point where a contract to finance, design, build, maintain and operate the system could be let following a tender process.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>THE CONCESSION</B></font>
<BR>The concession is likely to be granted by London Transport for a period of 99 years.  In June 1995, an advert was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union to seek out organisations interested in bidding for the Tramslink concession.  LT would retain the freehold of the land.  Should the concession company cease to fulfil the terms of the contract, or if the concession period is completed, LT will consider either a perpetual concession or re-tendering the contract for operating Tramlink after a given time.

<font color="#000099" size="3"><B><p>TIMETABLE</B></font>
<BR>The Croydon Tramlink Bill (a Private Bill) was deposited in Parliament in November 1991, and Royal Assent was granted in July 1994.  After the competitive tendering process, construction could start soon afterwards, with the probability that the first part of the system would start operation by 1997.  There will be a new dept on this branch at Therapia Lane, Beddington.  The whole Tramlink system could be operational by the end of 1998 or early in 1999.

<LI> The Underground runs until approximately 00.30. After this time you can use our extensive system of Night Buses.
<BR>
<BR><LI> Nearly all Night Buses pass through Trafalgar Square and serve theatres, cinemas and entertainment areas. Night buses treat all stops as a request stop. This means that you always have to ring the bell to get off a Night Bus at any bus stop.
<BR>
<BR><LI> Handy credit card size timetables and a Night Bus booklet are available from Travel Information Centres, selected newsagents and major Underground stations.
<BR>
<BR><LI> Fares are slightly higher than on day buses; for example, the adult single fare for a journey between Trafalgar Square and Camden Town during the day is 1.20. The same journey at night is 1.50. You cannot use any one day ticket, Family or Weekend Travelcard on Night Buses and children must pay adult fares after 22.00 on all buses.

<TR><TD>We are having to close the Bakerloo line between Piccadilly Circus and Elephant & Castle for eight months from 10 November. It's all part of Operation Hard Hat, our planned maintenance programme.
<P>
The work focuses on the refurbishment of the Bakerloo line tunnels under the Thames, to ensure they remain completely water tight for the next 100 years or so.
<P>
This is a major engineering project and we have carefully planned extra Underground and replacement bus services to help customers make their journeys around the closed section of line.
This site contains full details of our suggested alternative routes, plus maps to show where the special buses will stop.<P></TD></TR><TR>
<TD><font color="#0B007E"><h2>What's happening to the Bakerloo line services?</h2></td></TR>
<TR><TD><h3>Normal service Harrow & Wealdstone - Queen's Park</h3>
Trains will generally run at normal intervals over this section of line but there will be more Sunday and evening trains. Customers travelling to and from Charing Cross, Embankment or Waterloo should use the North London Railways service to/from Euston and then travel via the Northern line.
<P>
Between Queen's Park and Piccadilly Circus there will be fewer trains than normal but we shall run the maximum number that can be turned at Piccadilly Circus. If you are joining the Underground at Paddington you may find it easier to use the Circle line, or take a short walk to the Central line at Lancaster Gate.  Similarly, Marylebone passengers may be better off using Baker Street, for the Jubilee line.<P></TD></TR><TR>

<br>Die Londoner U-Bahn ist nicht nur das lteste und grte Metrosystem der Welt, sie ist auch eines der modernsten und bequemsten. Die Zge verkehren 20 Stunden am Tag.
<UL>
<LI>Jede U-Bahnlinie hat einen eigenen Namen und eine bestimmte Farbe. Das erleichtert es Ihnen, sich whrend Ihrer Fahrt anhand der Karte auf diesem Faltblatt zurechtzufinden. Wenn Sie auf einem Bahnhof ankommen, sehen Sie sich einfach nach den Hinweisschildern mit der entsprechenden Farbe um. Sie zeigen Ihnen den Weg zu Ihrer gewnschten Linie.
<p>
<LI>Meiden Sie die Stozeiten, wochentags zwischen 08.00 und 09.30 Uhr sowie 17.00 und 18.30 Uhr.
<p>
<LI>Fahrkarten erhalten Sie am Automaten oder am Fahrkartenschalter in jedem U-Bahnhof. Das U-Bahnnetz ist in sechs Tarifzonen unterteilt. Das Stadtzentrum ist Zone 1. Ihr Fahrpreis hngt davon ab, wieviele Zonen Sie durchfahren.
<p>
<LI>Sie mssen vor Fahrtantritt die entsprechende Fahrkarte fr Ihren Zielbahnhof lsen. Andernfalls mssen Sie mit einer Strafgebhr von 10 rechnen.
<p>
<LI>Sie knnen einen Einzelfahrschein oder eine Karte fr die Hin- und Rckfahrt lsen. Beide sind an dem Tag gltig, der auf der Fahrkarte angegeben ist. Am preiswertesten fahren Sie mit der Travelcard.
<p>
<LI>Viele U-Bahnhfe haben automatische Fahrkartenschranken. Diese ffnen sich, wenn Sie Ihre Fahrkarte in den Kartenschlitz stecken. Der Automat gibt Ihnen dann Ihre Fahrkarte zurck. Nehmen Sie sie und passieren Sie die geffnete Schranke. Wenn Ihre Fahrkarte nicht weiter gltig ist, wird sie vom Automaten einbehalten.
<p>
<LI>Fr Rollsthle, Kinderwagen und groe Gepckstcke gibt es spezielle Durchgnge. Bitten wenden Sie sich an das Personal.

In London sind Sie nie mehr als fnf Minuten Fuweg von einer der 17.000 Bushaltestellen entfernt. Es gibt zwei Arten von Haltestellen:
<P>
<IMG SRC="compuls.gif" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="49" align="left">Normale Haltestelle: Alle Busse halten automatisch, auer wenn sie voll sind. Nachtbusse halten nicht unbedingt (vgl. "Nachtverkehr").
<BR>
<P>
<BR><IMG SRC="request.gif" ALT="Request stop sign" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="49" align="left">Request Haltestelle: Hier halten die Busse nur nach Aufforderung (Englisch: "request"). Um einen Bus anzuhalten, mssen Sie rechtzeitig und deutlich die Hand ausstrecken, damit der Fahrer Sie sieht und den Wagen sicher anhalten kann. Busse, die bereits voll sind, fahren manchmal einfach weiter.
<UL>
<LI>Wenn Sie in einen Bus eingestiegen sind, setzen Sie sich wenn mglich hin, oder halten Sie sich gut fest.
 <BR><BR>
<LI> Das Busnetz ist in vier Tarifzonen unterteilt. Sie knnen Ihre Fahrkarte fr die entsprechende Kombination dieser Zonen lsen, die fr Sie am gnstigsten ist.
<BR>
<br><LI>Bezahlen Sie beim Fahrer (oder Schaffner) oder zeigen Sie Ihre Travelcard. Wenn Sie keine gltige Fahrkarte haben, mssen Sie mit einer Strafgebhr von 5 rechnen.
<BR>
<br><LI>Wenn Sie aussteigen wollen, bettigen Sie das Haltesignal rechtzeitig, damit der Wagen sicher halten kann. Wenn bereits vor Ihnen jemand das Signal bettigt hat, brauchen Sie das nicht noch einmal zu tun.
<BR>
<br><LI>Unsere Busse bieten Ihnen einen freundlichen, persnlichen und sicheren Fahrdienst. Zu Ihrer Sicherheit sind viele unserer Wagen mit Videokameras ausgestattet. Alle Busse haben Funkverbindung.
<BR>
<br><LI>Rauchen ist in den Bussen verboten.
<BR>
<br><LI>Einige Busse haben keine Tren, sondern eine offene Plattform. Versuchen Sie NIEMALS, in einen solchen Bus ein- oder auszusteigen, wenn dieser nicht an einer Haltestelle ist und angehalten hat.
<BR>
<br><LI>Seien Sie vorsichtig, wenn Sie die Strae berqueren. Manche Busse verkehren in speziellen Busspuren, die mitunter entgegengesetzt zur Haupt-Verkehrsrichtung verlaufen.

<TR><TD>We'll be running special Bakerloo line replacement buses between Elephant & Castle and Oxford Circus, serving all stations except Embankment (see below for details). These buses will run at all times the Bakerloo line would normally be running, and will give a 2 - 3 minute service at peak times over the busiest section of route between
Charing Cross and Oxford Circus. We will also be constantly monitoring normal bus services.<P>
<h3>Bus services to Waterloo</H3>
At the busiest times on Mondays to Saturdays, a bus every 3 - 6 minutes will run between Waterloo, Charing Cross, Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus. In addition to this, extra buses will run every 6 minutes between Elephant & Castle and Oxford Circus that will not call at Waterloo.<P>
If you're travelling to Waterloo please check carefully the front of the bus before boarding, where it will be clearly indicated whether the bus calls at Waterloo or not.<P>If you want to travel between Waterloo and Elephant & Castle, you should catch one of the many existing bus services that are available.<P>Bus stops will be clearly marked.</TD></TR>

<h2>Tickets on the Bakerloo line Bus</h2>
<img src="bus.jpg" align=right>
Please buy your ticket at the Underground ticket office as
no tickets will be sold on the buses. All valid Underground tickets (including those issued by National Railways or Docklands Light Railway for use on the Underground) will be accepted on the buses. Carnet tickets must be handed to the driver for checking. You must have a valid ticket for travel or you could be liable to
a 10 penalty fare.<p>

<h2>Other buses</h2>
In addition to the special bus service, extra buses will run on routes 1 and 68 at busy times. Buses 12 and 53 run close to all Bakerloo line stations between Elephant & Castle and
Oxford Circus except Embankment, and Bus 176 serves Elephant & Castle, Waterloo, Charing Cross
and Oxford Circus.
Please remember that Travelcards are valid on these and all other bus routes from the stations (but not single
or return railway tickets).

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>The Artemis Project</TITLE></HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<p align="center"><IMG SRC="Gifs/artlogobig.gif" align="top"><font

size=-2>TM</font></p>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Welcome to The Artemis Project!</H1>

<P><I>Enjoy the adventure!</I></P>

<h2>The Artemis Project is developing a private lunar base.</h2>

<P>A team of non-profit organizations led by the <A

HREF="asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a>, with the

support of a <A HREF="companyindex.html">team of commercial

companies</a>, is combining its efforts to establish a permanent

self-supporting community on the moon. <EM>You</EM> are invited to

come, too!  For the first time in history, you are invited to

participate directly in manned space flight by lending your talent

and enthusiasm to the project.</P>



<P>When the project is successful, you will be able to <a

href="moonvac.html">travel to the moon and beyond</a>.  <a

href="/asi_member.html">Join us</a> and take the first step on a

journey that need never end.</P>



<P>See our response to <A HREF="/adb/j/index.html">frequently asked

questions</A> to learn how we are able to build a program which up

until now was something only huge government agencies could do.

Some concerns might come up while you're learning about the project.

If so, check out our answers to <A HREF="/adb/j/fro_index.html">frequently

raised objections</A>.</P>



<P><a href="/adb/j/too-risky-for-investors.html">The idea</a> is

to avoid asking people to invest any money directly in the "risky"

business of space flight, but rather to seek investment in associated

ventures in known industries such as making <a

href="/adb/03/03/movie-revenues.html">movies</a>, television, <a

href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemag/artemis-mag.html">publications</a>,

and <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">merchandising</a>.

The promise of the project is sufficiently entertaining that if we

tell the story well, we'll have enough money to be at <a

href="/adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html">break-even</a> before we

do the <a href="/adb/04/">first launch</a>.</P>



<h3>Getting Involved</h3>



<P>Less than 5% of the work needs to be done by rocket scientists,

so you can <A HREF="Things_You_Can_Do.html">make a significant

contribution</A> to the development of manned space flight even if

you don't have a PhD in astronautics.</P>


<h3>Artemis Data Book</h3>



<P>All the information about the project is stored in the <A

HREF="http://www.asi.org/adb/outline.html">Artemis Data Book</A>.

The Data Book has had over 400 new files since February, and is

the main repository of completed technical documents. Some hilights

include essays on <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen

extraction</a>, <a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3

intro</a>, <a href="/adb/04/03/05/consumable-reduction.html">consumable

requirements</a>, <a href="/adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html">revenue

analysis</a>, <a href="/adb/04/03/01/radar-requirements.html">radar

requirements</a>, and <a href="/adb/04/01/01/04/day-01.html">day

1 surface operations</a>, to name a few from hundreds of documents.

Check the <a href="/adb/outline.html">outline</a> to find topics

in your areas of interest.</P>



<H3>Shameless Commercialism</H3>



<P>Our <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">on-line catalog</A>

has an ever-growing list of Artemis Project trinkets that you must

have.  Check the special deal on Lunar Transfer Vehicles, available

for a limited time only!</P>



<P>We also have a <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Poster.html">poster</A>

with illustrations of what the <A

HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Reference_mission.html">reference

mission</A> spacecraft look like.</P>



<H3>Electronic Communication</H3>



<p>One of the greatest challenges for the project is having a huge

team spread out all over the world.  We keep in touch through

extensive use of electronic communication.  You're standing at the

tip of the iceberg, at the main entrance to the Artemis Project's

World Wide Web Site.</p>



<p>Discussion groups, <a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">mailing

lists</a>, <a href="/adb/09/06/01/genie.html">on-line services</a>,

and all the rest are described in <a href="/adb/09/overview.html">

section 9 of the Artemis Data Book</a>.</p>



<H3>The Artemis Society Near You</H3>



<P>People around the world are interested in the project and are

forming local chapters.  We have a list of them so you can find <A

HREF="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">people in your neighborhood</A>

to discuss forming a chapter and helping the project.  If you're

interested and there isn't a local contact near, you send email to

<A  hREF="mailto:asi@asi.org">&lt;asi@asi.org&gt;</A> about getting

listed as a local contact or about forming a chapter. If you are

also part of a pro-space organization email us about <a

href="/adb/10/sponsorship.html">affiliating with ASI</a>.</P>



<H3>Guestbook</H3>



<P>If you're interested in the Artemis Project please sign our <A

HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/guestbook.html">guestbook</A>.</P>



<P><b><i>A Little Secret</i></b></P>



<p>Every night, just after midnight Eastern U.S. time, our machine

updates its list of files that have changed in the past 24 hours.

This <a href="/whatsnew/whatsnew.html">whatsnew</a> page might seem bewildering

at first, especially since many of the files you see in the list

are pages we're still developing (guaranteed not to make much

sense), but as you become a veteran lunar explorer it will become

a valuable tool for keeping up with the Artemis Project.  </p>



<HR>



<P>Send feedback and questions about <b>The Artemis Project</b>

to <A

HREF="mailto:artemis@asi.org">&lt;artemis@asi.org&gt;</A>.</P>



<P>Send feedback about the web pages to <A

HREF="http://www.access.digex.net/~dcarson">Dana Carson</A> <A

<P>We're open to proposals from any business that would like to become a
proud <a href="/companyindex.html">sponsor</a> of
the <a href="/index.html">Artemis Project</a>. The concept here is that
just about anyone can help sponsor the project by putting the logo on your
package and slipping a little explanatory brochure inside the box (or
printing a blurb in that blank space you don't know what to do with).</P>
<P>The logo isn't widely known yet, but any business, whether
it's a software house or a shoe store, would benefit from increased market
share rather quickly just due to word-of-mouth advertising, once your
customers start spreading those little brochures around.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Your Vacation on the Moon</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><img src="/Gifs/artlogona.gif" ALT="Artemis Project Logo" align=top><!-- file: /moonvac.html --><h1>Your Vacation on the Moon</H1><P><HR><P><P>If the Artemis Project fulfills its full potential, you will be abletotravel in space yourself! Within fifteen years, you will be able to takeatwo-week trip to the moon at a price you would expect to pay for theluxury-class European capital tour.</P><P>Read on to see how you can go to the moon, and beyond.</P><BR><P align=center><img src="/images/asi199600029.gif" Alt="Commercial SSTOatLaunch" width=384 height=256></P><P>You and your spouse board the shiny new <ahref="/adb/02/07/01/02/ssto-business-plan.html">Single Stage To Orbitrocket</a>, the Melva Gay, at your local airport. There are fiftypassengers plus a crew of five on board. Each passenger has about thesameamount of room as a first-class airline seat. It's a bit crowded for along trip, but remember that zero-g will make the space a lotlarger.</P><P>The SSTO flies to orbit, where within two hours it makes a rendezvouswith the fuel depot. You spend your first day in zero-g at the fueldepotwhile the ship is serviced and retanked for the flight to the moon. Thisgives you some time for sightseeing as the ship orbits the Earth 8times.</P><P>The next morning (ship's time) the Melva Gay is "Go" for translunarinjection.After the initial boost from LEO, you're in zero-g for the next two daysonthe way to the moon. More sight-seeing, of course. The crew breaks out abig telescope so you can do some astronomical gawking if you want.</P><P align=center><img align=center src="/images/asi199600031r1.gif"Alt="Commercial SSTO at TransLunar Injection" width=384 height=256></P><P>For insertion into lunar orbit, the crew chases the passengers backtotheir seats and makes sure everyone is buckled up. We orbit the moon foranother sight-seeing tour and then fly the descent track. The Melva Gaylandsa few hundred yards from the <ahref="/adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html">Luna City Hotel & Cantina</a>.</P><P align=center><img align=center src="/images/asi199600033r1.gif"Alt="Commercial SSTO Landing on the Moon" width=384 height=256></P><P>A pressurized bus then comes out to take you to the base. Thereyou'reassigned a small bedroom (the bath is down the hall, but the showers arenice and hot). At dinner the first night you get to know the moon crewandreceive a talk on the local scenery. Nighttime comes, but it's notreallynight. You have the Earthside view from your bedroom window for thefirsthalf of your stay on the moon. After five days, you'll trade rooms withsomeone on the other side of the moon base.</P><P>Next morning it's time for suit drill. You should have passed yoursuitcertification before you left Earth, but these guys are careful; theysincerely hope not to have any of their guests killed on the tour. (Theycould use the organic elements, but it's bad for business.) Thatafternoonyou go on a walking tour to visit the local sights. Once you'reconfidentwith moving around on the moon, you take one of the bus tours.</P><P>Later, the bus tours go out for several days at a time. You'll liveinmore spartan conditions, camped out in bunks on the bus, but you'll seealot more of the moon close up.</P><P>After ten days on the moon, you again board the Melva Gay. You'vetradedoff ten pounds of your baggage allowance for rocks and gemstones youliftedfrom the surface of the moon with your own hand. The Melva Gay, and someexternal tanks containing liquid oxygen for the next SSTO, blasts offforEarth. After another day and a half of zero-g, the Melva Gay brakes tore-enter Earth Orbit, and deposits its external tanks. From there itre-enters the atmosphere for a landing. Two hours later, you're drivinghome from the same airport you departed.</P><BR><P>That's what we're offering, folks. We have the technologicalcapabilityto make it happen with fifteen years or less, if we can get past thefinancial and political hurdles.</P><P>Would you like to <a href="/adb/06/08/07/ssto-pt-tasks.html">helpmakeit happen</a>?</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">ReferenceMission</a></b><td align=center> <b><ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=1>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Sun, Jan 5, 1997<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

If we are unable to generate the <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/04/">revenues needed to fly the spacecraft, we still will not have lost money because the spacecraft development depends on revenues generated from its entertainment value.</P><P>The <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/03/investment-strategy.html">idea</a> is to avoid investing any money in the space flight directly, but rather to seek investment in associated ventures in known industries such as making <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/04/movie-revenues.html">movies</a>, television, <a target="_top" href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemis_mag.html">publications</a>, and <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/04/merchandise.html">merchandising</a>.  The promise of the project is sufficiently entertaining that if we tell the story well, we'll have enough money to be at break-even before we do the first launch.</P><P>We shouldn't need to go out and ask people to invest big bucks in a risky business.  In fact, we're being very conservative in the new startups we're working on.  For instance, we need <I><A target="_top" HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/artemis_mag.html">Artemis Magazine</A></I>&nbsp;to introduce the project to a certain segment of the market.  Instead of trying to launch a multi-billion-dollar publishing empire all at once, the business plan calls for less than $400,000 in startup capital.  It's based on middling sales, about 1/4 the circulation of <I>Analog</I>, and would yield a nice rate of return to investors.  This is a market we know and understand.  If the project is really as popular as we hope and circulation figures are off the charts, then <I>Artemis Magazine</I>&nbsp;will become a major contributor to the Lunar Base Development Fund.  If not, we'll still be contributing a really nice publication from a <a target="_top" href="/bios/strock.ian.html">top-notch editor</a>.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>3.3 Movie Revenues</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 3.3 Financing The Project --><!-- file: /adb/03/03/movie-revenues.html --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">3.3 Financing The Project</H2><h2 align="center">Movie Revenues</H2><P><HR><P><P>Many times in the course of the project people have raised the <ahref="/adb/j/fro_index.html">issue</a> of movie revenues and theirrole in financing the missions.  When you comparewhat we're doing with the <a href="/adb/m/02/07/">Apollo program</a>, itdoesn't seem to add up.  But<a href="/bios/artemis-bio.html">Artemis</a> is not Apollo.  (Hey, he's aboy; <a href="/bios/artemis-bio.html">She</a> might be His twin sister, butShe's a girl!)</P><P>In fact, except for using technology and science from the Apollo program andhaving the same general destination, there is really no comparison between thetwo programs.  We're not going for the same reasons, we're not planning ondoing the same things once we get there, we're using a completely differentapproach to managing and carrying out the program.</P><P>A few important points:</P><OL><LI><P>We're not talking about just one movie production, but rather aseries of dozens.</P><LI><P>We're under no obligation to make an accurate documentary film likeFOR ALL MANKIND.  Our only obligation is to make money.</P><LI><P>We'll probably make a nice, accurate documentary, but that's noteven figured into the balance sheet yet.</P><LI><P>All films about the Apollo program to date have to compete with ahuge amount of free (or almost free) information about Apollo. In contrast,all our footage, including news coverage, is copyrighted and distributionis controlled.</P><LI><P><I>For All Mankind</I> came out 25 years after the flight, when everyoneinterested in the Apollo program already had been exposed to it in asaturated market.</P><LI><P>Test pilots, as shown by the government, at least, aretwo-dimensional cardboard characters with near-zero stage presence.  Noteven other test pilots can identify with the stick figures you see in filmsabout Apollo; they aren't real.  In contrast, we're out to have a funexperience with Artemis and to share that fun with everyone.</P><LI><P>There's a built-in punishment to being an Apollo fan; you know thatno matter how neat you think it is, you can't go yourself.  The ArtemisProject is the opposite of Apollo.  We're not showing you how great it wasfor a few test pilots; we're showing you how great it's going to be for<I>you</I>.  The market appeal of that promise, which we seriously intend tofulfill, is tremendous.</P><LI><P>Space fans were barred from direct participation in Apollo.  NASAstraight-armed everyone not directly employed by the program, telling themto get off to the bleachers where fans belong.  (I'm not NASA- bashing.They had to do this; it was the nature of the program.)</P><LI><P>In dramatic contrast, the Artemis Project actively seeksparticpation by everyone who wants to share our playpen.  It's notsomething someone else did; it's something we<I>all</I>&nbsp;accomplished.</P><LI><P>Apollo was done for the dead-end goal of making the country lookimpressive to the international community.  Artemis is being done for theopen-ended goal of space development for everybody.  Apollo was thegovernment's program; Artemis is the people's program.</P><LI><P>Revenues from Artemis don't compare with Apollo any more than theapproach to spacecraft development and operations.</P><LI><P>The greatest roadblock to the Artemis Project is mental.  "We havenothing to fear but fear itself."  People have wanted to do this so muchfor so long, and have been so disappointed that the government hasn't doneit for them, that just they can't believe it's happening. People have cometo believe that space flight will happen only by magic gifts from someunseen genie named The Future.  They've been taught all their lives thatthere is nothing they can do to make it happen but beg the government to doit, and to date that has produced near zero results.</P><P>To make this project work, we first have to overcome that fear.  It'snot easy, because it has been programmed into us since the day JFK set thedeadline for landing a man on the moon in ten years.</P><LI><P>A little damage to our credibility, for a technical standpoint atleast, is a good thing.  In contrast to the government's guise ofunflagging confidence in their technical ability (even when this was nottrue), it makes it more exciting if we appear to be a bunch of crazy rocketscientists who just might, somehow, pull this thing off.</P><P>Similarly, concerns about the political viability of the project canincrease the excitement of the project, as long as people don't give upbecause of fear of the government.</P></OL><P>And, of course, movie revenues are now a much less significant part of the<a href="/adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html">anticipated revenues</a> for theArtemis Project.  The potential revenues frommotion pictures were enough to get my attention and get the project going, butnow that we're a serious corporation we're being less cavalier with ourbusiness plans; we have our personal fortunes at stake in this one.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html">Reference Mission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><P><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Fri, Sept 27, 1996<br>Content by <a href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">Gregory R.

<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>3.1 Revenue Analysis</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 3.1 The Balance Sheet --><!-- file: /adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html --><!-- Keywords: revenue cost profit merchandising money story moviemerchanding --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">3.1 The Balance Sheet</H2><h2 align="center">Revenue Analysis</H2><P><HR><P><P>We've been reluctant to distribute the numbers without the accompanyingBasis of Estimate.  That leaves the field open for a few nay-sayingiconoclasts to waste an enormous amount of our time by spamming the netwith<a href="/adb/j/fro_index.html">misinterpretations</a> of the data.  That'sone of the unfortunate side effects of the Internet which we'll just haveto deal with as it arises.  We're learning to be more hard-nosed in dealingwith recreational nay-sayers: if they can't provide hard, documentednumbers along with their arguments, it doesn't make sense to take theirarguments into account.  We just don't have time to deal with fictionalfinancial data.</p><P>For example, take the notion of earning $800 million from a single movie.That came from the table published in the article in the <ahref="http://www.tlrc.com/Analog9501.html">January 1995 Analog</a>.As you'll see in the table below, we've actually increased the estimate oftotal net <a href="/adb/03/04/movie-revenues.html">revenues from motionpictures</a> to $1.2 billion.  This is the net from a series of moviesreleased over a period of 10 years, each movie with half the attendance ofthe previous one. The number is larger than before because in the past twoyears we've learned a lot more about movies, where the money comes from andwhere it goes, and who gets how much of the profit.</P><P>Some of the numbers (especially publications, merchandising,simulations, and motion pictures) are fairly solid, based on research intotheir respective industries.  But others (educational and scientific datain particular) are just educated guesses. These two carry little of theexpected revenues, however.</P><P>It is possible we've really underestimated the value of productendorsements.   That's where we'd list businesses which elect to sponsor theproject in return for promotional consideration, without actually producing aproduct directly related to the project.  Nothing in this table reflects thatsort of sponsorship because we don't have any basis for estimating it.  Wereally need some help on that one; it could be a trivial factor, or it couldoverwhelm the rest of the numbers.</P><P>Also, merchandising of <a href="/adb/03/04/">lunar samples</a> returnedfrom the moon will probably be a large source of income. It cannot beincluded in this table, however, as we have no way to <ahref="/adb/03/04/">determine its value</a> accurately without a <ahref="/adb/03/03/marketing-survey-info.html">market survey</a>, which wouldbe expensive and labor-consuming, and the Project isn't at the stage yetwhere it has large amounts of disposable manpower.

<H1>Things You Can Do</h1>
<P><HR><P>

<P>If you want to lend a hand to the <a href="/artemis.html">Artemis
Project</a> and help pave the way into space, here are a few things you can
do to help:</P>

<ol>
<li><a href="/asi_member.html">Join the Artemis Society</a>
<P>
<li>Join and contribute to <a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">Online
Discussions</a>
<P>
<lI>Work on tasks outlined in task lists for various groups:

<ul><li><a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html">Electronic Communications
Technical Committee Tasks</a>
<li><a href="/adb/03/07/cdrom-tasks.html">Artemis Project CD-ROM Tasks</a>
<lI><a href="/adb/06/07/04/11/propulsion-tc-tasks.html">Spacecraft
Propulsion Technical Committee Tasks</a>
<lI><a href="/adb/06/08/07/ssto-pt-tasks.html">SSTO Concept Design Project
Team Tasks</a>
<lI><a href="/adb/03/07/calender-tasks.html">Artemis Project Calender Tasks</a>
<li><a href="/adb/06/07/05/02/logistics-tasks.html">Logistics Technical
Committee Tasks</a>
<li><a href="/adb/03/07/sample-return-tasks.html">Lunar Sample Return
Project Tasks</a>
<lI><a href="/adb/06/07/02/01/03/lunar-science-tc-tasks.html">Lunar Science
Technical Committee Tasks</a>
<lI><a href="/adb/06/asi-tasks.html">Artemis Society International Task
List</a></ul>

<P>

<lI>Check out the <a href="/adb/06/07/osf-index.html">List of Technical
Committees</a> and <a href="/adb/06/08/pt-listing.html">Project Teams</a>,
select groups of interest,  and email the chairman to see what you can do.
Also, there are forms online to <a href="/adb/06/07/tc-join.html">join Tech
Committees</a> and <a href="/adb/06/08/pt-join.html">Project Teams</a> of
interest.</P>

<P>
<li>Start a <a href="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">Local Chapter</a> for
your area and spread the word!
<P>
<li>Write papers for the <a href="/adb/">Artemis Data Book</a> on topics
applicable to the Artemis Project. Look through the tasks below for ideas
on topics.</P>

<P><LI>Do artwork (paintings, drawings, 3-D renderings, etc.) of elements of
the Artemis Project. The Reference Mission, lunar development and tourism,
and the concepts behind the Artemis Project need artists to work on them
especially, but nearly anything is fair game. Artwork of <I>everything</I>
is needed, and if it's used in a commercial product, you'll get
royalties.</P>
</ol>

<P><HR><P>



<P>This is the very long list of all tasks.   Some of these actually could
be broken down into lots of little tasks, like organizing the on-line
discussions; that could be chopped up topic by topic.  (And probably should
be.)</P>

<P>This is only the tip of the iceberg, of course.  You'll see some
litanies develop in the list.  For instance, we need artwork of
<I>everything</I>.</P>


<br>

<P>Poke through this list of to-do's, and look for topics you could write
up an essay or paper on, or just dump your insights on that topic onto <a
href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">artemis-list</a>.</p>

<br>
<P>Here are some more tasks written up in detail.  (One of the jobs that
needs a volunteer is someone to write up tasks.)</P>

<h2 align="center">How to Get Oxygen from the Moon</h2>

<p align="center"><I>Gregory Bennett</I></p>

<h3>The Importance of Lunar Oxygen</h3>

<p>About 85% of the weight of a typical spacecraft at launch is the oxygen used for rocket fuel.  Since oxygen is the most abundant element in lunar soil, comprising nearly half of the lunar regolith by weight, oxygen mined from the moon can play a critical role in space industries.  Besides giving us considerable leverage in our development of a space transportation system, lunar oxygen can become one of the lunar community's most important economic exports.</p>

<p>Lunar oxygen, condensed into liquid and stored in tanks made from lunar
metals, can be shipped economically from the moon to refuel spacecraft
throughout cislunar space.  In fact, one of the early development goals of
the Artemis Project is to provide this refueling service to <a
href="/adb/02/07/ssto-business-plan.html">passenger-carrying spacecraft in
low Earth orbit</a>.  That extra fuel load gives a commercial passenger
spacecraft what it needs to fly all the way to the moon, land, and return
to low Earth orbit without need for another refueling.  In this scenario,
we would refill the oxygen tanks on the moon before the passenger craft
takes off for Earth, delivering another load of oxygen for the next
customer.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful scenario, but first we have to get the oxygen out of the moon's soil.</p>

<h3>How to Extract Oxygen from Lunar Soil</h3>

<h4> First, Find Some Ilmenite</h4>

<p>Moon dust is a mixture of many different minerals, and nearly all of them contain oxgyen in considerable abundance.  One of the most common lunar minerals is <em>ilmenite</em>, a mixture of iron, titanium, and oxygen.  (Ilmenite also often contains other metals such as magnesium which we'll blithely ignore here.)  For this discussion, we'll concentrate on extracting oxygen from ilmenite because there's lots of the stuff available, and because the chemical processes involved are fairly straightforward.</p>

<h4>Chemistry of the Lunar Oxygen Extraction Process</h4>

<p>To separate ilmenite into is primary consituents, we add hydrogen and heat the mixture.  This produces raw iron, rutile, and water.  (Rutile is titanium dioxide, the ore commonly used for producing titanium metal on Earth.  In its crystalline form it's a gemstone.  As a powder it's the most common white pigment used in paint.)  </p>

<p>The chemical reaction looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/images/asi199500024.gif" width="330" height="26" alt="Chemical equation fro the process of separating oxygen, hydrogen, iron, and rutile from ilmenite"></p>

<p>That titanium is another important metal we'll want to use in a lot of lunar industries, and the oxygen attached to it is seductive.  About 45% of the lunar soil and rocks is made up of oxgyen, and eventually we'd like to be able to use all of it.  But our primary concern in this essay is the oxygen in that water we just extracted.  With just those water molecules, we can immediately recover 10.5% of the weight of the regolith we've moved as oxgyen.</p><p>We'll have to use a more complex process, perhaps using a chlorine or flourine reaction, to get pure titanium and more oxygen; but for the initial pilot plant we have an easier approach.  Water is made of just hydrogen and oxygen, so we can use simple electrolysis to separate the two gasses.</p>

<h4>Lunar Oxygen Extraction Pilot Plant</h4>

<p>The process starts with <a href="/adb/04/02/05/04/"> regolith-handling robots </a> bringing raw moon dust to the pilot plant.  There, with a system we could design to be the size of a briefcase for the first flight, the pilot plant takes over.</p>

<p>Once the process is going, the hydrogen we get from electrolysis of water can be recycled and used for the next load of ilmenite.  But to get it started with an initial supply of hydrogen, we need only heat the raw regolith to about 600 degrees C.  That will drive off hydrogen (and a host of other interesting gasses, including <a href="/adb/02/09/index.html"> helium</a>) that we use to reduce the first load of lunar soil.</p>


<p align="center"><img src="/images/asi199500025.gif" width="415" height="415" alt="Process of separating oxygen, hydrogen, iron, and rutile from ilmenite"></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Figure 4.3.10.4-1 Lunar Oxygen Pilot Plant</strong></p>

<p>The robot dumps the moon soil into a hopper, which filters the dust into the first reaction chamber.  Here we use simple solar reflectors to heat the vessel and drive off the volatile gasses.  Heating the vessel provides the gas pressure we need to move the gasses to the separation unit, which pumps hydrogen into the hydrogen tank and the rest of the gasses into the next industrial process down the line.</p>

<p>The regolith and hydrogen are introduced into another chamber where more solar heating is used to raise the temperature above 900 deg C, where the hydrogen will reduce ilmenite into iron and rutile.  Gaseous water vapor is pumped on to the electrolysis vessel.  If we raise the temperature above 1,525 deg C, the iron will melt and separate out from the solids, leaving the rutile behind.  The rutile will decompose at 1,640 deg C before it melts.</p>

<p>Electrolysis is simply the process of applying electricity to water to cause it to separate into oxygen and hydrogen.  We use photovoltaic solar cells to generate the electricity.  Each of these gasses will collect at an opposite pole of the electrolyis apparatus.  From there the hydrogen is pumped into the hydrogen storage tank, where in joins other hydrogen extract directly from the regolith in the initial heating process.  The oxygen is pumped into a storage tank where it is condensed into liquid form for use as rocket propellant or introduced into the lunar base's life support system.</p>

<h4>Further Investigations</h4>

<p>This article barely scratches the surface.  We would like to carry a small pilot plant on the first Artemis Project manned mission, perhaps even on an earlier robotic flight.  To do that, we have to answer a host of technical questions and then design, develop, and manufacture the pilot plant.</p>

<p>Many areas of further investigation are open for your amusement:</p>
<ul>
  <li> detail the processes inside those mysterious reaction chambers
  <li> determine what temperatures are required in each reaction chamber
  <li> calculate how much power is needed for pumps
  <li> define the exact method to be used for separating gasses during the preheating process
  <li> design a holding facility for the gasses
  <li> design instrumentation to control and monitor the process, and to report the experimental results
  <li> design the solar reflectors used for heating the reaction chambers
  <li> detailed design and fabrication of a small pilot plant
  <li> fabricate a prototype oxygen plant for experimentation on Earth
  <li> tromp out into the desert and scoop up some basaltic fines for use in the prototype plant
  <li> develop an economic model for the lunar oxygen business
</ul>

<h4>Spinoff: Titanium Production from Ilmenite</h4>

<p>There's an interesting side effect to developing this technology for oxygen production.  Today on Earth, most titanium metal is produced from rutile laboriously mined from sands in Florida and Australia.  However, if an efficient process is developed for extracting rutile from ilmenite, we might serendipitously have an economic effect on the world's titanium production.  On Earth, ilmenite is about fifty times more abundant than rutile; so this research could have a positive effect on terrestrial production of titanium.  Even if that happens, however, we still should be able to deliver titanium to the spaceborne community at much lower cost than Earth-based producers.</p>

<h4>Join Us in the Grand Adventure</h4>

<p>As you can see from the above list of things to do, there are parts of this project you can contribute to whether you're a high school student or a PhD chemist.  Unlike the helium-3 question, oxygen extraction is an area of experimentation that doesn't require an elaborate laboratory with and nuclear reactors.  This area is vital to the initial economic stability of the lunar community so if you want to get into technical investigations besides designing spacecraft it would be a good place to concentrate your efforts.  Please contact <a href="mailto:artemis@asi.org">&lt;artemis@asi.org&gt;</a> if you would like to participate in this technical work.</p>

<p>If you have done research in extracting oxygen and other material from the lunar regolith (or any other subject applicable to development of a permanent lunar communty), please allow us to add your papers to the Artemis Data Book.  Contact <a href="mailto:artemis@asi.org">&lt;artemis@asi.org&gt;</a> to arrange to have your papers posted here on the Artemis Project's World Wide Web site.</p>

<title>Lunar Helium 3</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000" link="#0000AA" vlink="#AA0000">

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</h2>
<h2 align="center">2.9 Fusion Power from the Moon</h2>
<h2 align="center">Lunar Helium-3 as an Energy Source,<br> in a nutshell</h1>

<p align="center">Gregory Bennett</p>

<h2 align="center">The Setting</h2>

<p>For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that the He3
fusion plants have
been proved out, and folks are frantically building them, just waiting for us
to show up with with tanks full of helium-3.</p>


<h2 align="center">The Ingredients of Nuclear Fusion</h2>

<p>The names of the ingredients for nuclear fusion reactions -- deuterium, tritium, isotopes of helium -- sound complicated, but really these are only variations on substances found in everyday life.  We'll assume you understand that atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  <strong>Electons</strong> are the very lightweight, negatively charged bits that buzz around the edges of an atom.  Regular chemical reactions work by trading and sharing electons among atoms.  For instance, when you burn a piece of paper in air, the chemical reaction involves some carbon atoms in the paper sharing electrons with some oxygen atoms from the air.  The reaction forms carbon dioxide gas while the electons give off energy, as heat and light, when they change their orbits. </p>

<p><strong>Protons</strong> and <strong>neutrons</strong> make up an atom's nucleus.  In this discussion, we're concerned with rearranging the nucleus of an atom; hence the term "nuclear reaction."  Generally, the neutrally charged neutrons keep the positively charged protons from fighting each other.  An atom's nucleus is very tightly bound together, so when we start moving these things around, we're moving energy around in a big way.</p>

<p><strong>Hydrogen</strong> is the familiar stuff used to make up water by combining it with oxygen.  It's the most abundant element in the universe.  Normal hydrogen has 1 proton and no neutrons.  <strong>Deuterium</strong> is an isotope of
hydrogen that has a neutron next to its lonely proton.  </p>

<p align="center">
<img src="he3-diagram.gif" width=428 height=301 align="center"></p>
<p>You're familiar with <strong>helium</strong> gas as the stuff we use to blow up blimps and balloons.  
Normal helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in its nucleus, giving it an
atomic weight of 4.  </p>

<p>Now, if you kick out one of neutrons, you get helium-3.  This happens once in a while in very energetic nuclear reactors, especially the sun.  The sun produces helium by fusing hydrogen atoms together, but about one in every ten thousand helium atoms comes out missing a neutron.</p>

<p>He3 casts lustful eyes upon that neutron in the deuterium, and
will grab it if it gets a chance.  We give it a chance by introducing
the He3 to the deuterium at a high temperature.</p>


<h2 align="center">The Mixture</h2>

<p>He3 is used in a reaction with deuterium to produce energy:</p>

<p align=center><img src="he3-eqn.gif" width=384 height=40 align="center" 
alt="D + He3 --&#62;  p(14.7 MeV) + He4 (3.7 MeV) + 18.4 MeV"></p>

<p>This is a nuclear fusion reaction.  The deuterium and helium-3 atoms come
together to give off a proton and helium-4.  The products weigh less than the
initial components; the missing mass is converted to energy.  1 kg of
helium-3
burned with 0.67 kg of deuterium gives us about 19 megawatt-years of energy
output.</p>

<p>The fusion reaction time for the D-He3 reaction becomes significant at a
temperature of about 10 KeV, and peaks about about 200 KeV.  A 100 KeV (or
so)
reactor looks about optimum.</p>

<p>A reactor built to use the D-He3 reaction would be inherently safe.  The
worst-case failure scenario would not result in any civilian fatalities or
significant exposures to radiation.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> <b>MeV</b> and <b>KeV</b> are measures of energy, standing for mega-electron volts and kilo-electron volts, respectively.  In nuclear physics, these terms are used to refer to the amount of energy in a nuclear reactor.  One <b>electron volt</b> is the energy acquired by one electron falling through a potential of one volt, equal to approximately 1.609 E-19 joule.</p>

<h2 align="center">The supply</h2>

<p>Some He3 is available on Earth. It is a by-product of the maintenance of
nuclear weapons, which would supply us with about 300 kg of He3 and could
continue to produce about 15 kg per year.  The total supply in the U.S.
strategic reserves of helium is abou 29 kg, and another 187 kg is mixed up
with the natural gas we have stored; these sources are not renewable at any
significant rate.</p>

<p>In their 1988 paper, Kulcinski, et al. (see ref note below), estimate a
total
of 1,100,000 metric tonnes of He3 have been deposited by the solar wind in
the
lunar regolith.  Since the regolith has been stirred up by collisions with
meteorites, we'll probably find He3 down to depths of several meters.</p>

<p>The highest concentrations are in the lunar maria; about half the He3 is deposited
in the 20% of the lunar surface covered by the maria.</p>

<p>To extract He3 from the lunar soil, we heat the dust to about 600 degrees C.</p>

<p>We get most of the other volatiles out at the same time, so we'll be heating
up the rocks anyway.  (To get the oxgyen out, we'll turn up the furnace to
about 900 deg C and do some other nasty stuff; but that's a <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">different story</a>.)</p>

<h2 align="center">The Energy</h2>

<p>That 1 million metric tonnes of He3, reacted with deuterium, would generate
about 20,000 terrawatt-years of thermal energy.  The units alone are awesome: a terrawatt-year is one trillion (10 to 12th power) watt-years.  To put this into perspective, one 100-watt light bulb will use 100 watt-years of energy in one year.</p>


<p>That's about 10 times the energy we could get from mining all the fossil
fuels on Earth, without the smog and acid rain.  If we torched all our
uranium
in liquid metal fast breeder reactors, we could generate about half this much
energy, and have some interesting times storing the waste.</p>


<h2 align="center">The Value</h2>

<p>About 25 tonnes of He3 would power the United States for 1 year at our
current rate of energy consumption.  To put it in perspective: that's about
the weight of a fully loaded railroad box car, or a maximum Space Shuttle
payload.</p>

<p>To assign an economic value, suppose we assume He3 would replace the fuels
the United States currently buys to generate electricity.  We still have all
those power generating plants and distribution network, so we can't use how
much we <em>pay </em> for electricity.  As a replacement for that fuel, that 25-tonne
load of He3 would worth on the order of $75 billion today, or $3 billion per
tonne.</p>


<h2 align="center">The Payoff</h2>

<p>A guess is the best we can do.  Let's suppose that by the time we're
slinging
tanks of He3 off the moon, the world-wide demand is 100 tonnes of the stuff a
year, and people are happy to pay $3 billion per tonne.  That gives us gross
revenues of $300 billion a year.</p>

<p>To put that number in perspective: Ignoring the cost of money and taxes and
whatnot, that rate of income would launch a moon shot like our reference
mission every day for the next 10,000 years.  (At which point, we will have
used up all the helium-3 on the moon and had better start thinking about
something else.)</p>

Largercrews and permanent manning of the outpost only worsens the problem.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><I>Table 1: Human Consumable Consumption (per person)</I><B>                       kg per day</B>  Air                       1.55  Oxygen                  0.84  CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> removal             0.71  Food                      1.77  Food Solids             0.62  Water in food           1.15  Potable Water             2.38  Food prep water         0.76  Drink                   1.62  Sanitary Water            9.27  Dish wash water         2.45  Hand & face wash water  4.09  Shower water            2.73  Water                    12.99  Urine flush water       0.49  Clothes wash water     12.50                        --------                         27.98 kg.person.day<FONT SIZE=2>[Designing for Human Presence in Space: An Introduction toEnvironmental Control and Life Support Systems, NASA RP-1324]</FONT></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To cut the consumable mass requires extracting consumables from themoon, or reusing materials already shipped to the moon.</P><a name="oxygen"> </a><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Lunar Oxygen Extraction</H3><P>The moon's <a href="/adb/02/02/lunar-rock-components.html">resources</a>include little needed for life, except oxygen, which is the most plentifulelement on the moon's crust.

While this is still a large mass to be importedregularly, it is now in the realm of feasible endeavors. However,extraction of the required 33.2 tons of lunar oxygen is difficult andenergy-intensive, and it is possible to recycle much of the above mass.</P><a name="water"> </a><H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Water Recycling</H3><P>The human body loses much of its water through exhaling and perspirationinto the atmosphere. This water must be condensed out of the cabin air beforeit gets uncomfortably humid, and water extracted in this manner is very pure.With some relatively lightweight membrane filters, it is possible to createpotable water out of the humidity control atmospheric condensors, neededanyway for operationin an enclosed environment, to supply much of the crew's drinking water.</P><P>An average human exhales 2.28 kg of water each day. The daily requirementfor pure water is 2.38 kg, leaving 100 g daily to be imported. Assuming lunaroxygen is used, 11 g of H<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> must be imported perperson/day for drinking water.</P><P>It is also very easy to filter sanitary water (for showers, washinghands, etc.) for reuse. Exposing it to raw sunlight through a pane ofUV-transparant quartz, which also boils the water, would kill nearly allmicrobes, putting the concentration far below levels for safety. If passedthrough a series of filters, nearly all of the sanitary water could berecovered. Assuming 99% recovery, and using lunar oxygen for the oxygencomponent of replacement water, 99.89% of sanitary water imports areeliminated.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><I>Table 3: Mass for Import with Water Recycling</I><B>                       kg per day</B>Air                       1.55  Oxygen                  0.84  CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> removal             0.71Food                      1.77Potable Water            0.011Sanitary Water           0.010Water                    0.504  Urine flush water       0.49  Clothes wash water     0.014                        --------                          3.85 kg.person.dayLunar Oxygen Extracted   0.282Hydrogen Imported        0.035CO<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT> Scrubber Imported     0.71</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This would now be 5.6 tons for a crew of 4 staying 1 year, including1.2 tons of oxygen.

The hydrogen used in the reaction would be recycledwith very high efficiency. Assuming 99.6% efficiency, for every 1000 kg ofoxygen recycled, 1 kg of replacement hydrogen will be required.</P><P>Carbon released in this reaction, in the form of charcoal, can be usedto extract volatiles and contaminants from the cabin atmosphere. Withoutconstant filtering by activated charcoal, the habitat would accumulatesmells very quickly and soon begin to reduce productivity, thus the need toimport filters is eliminated by this useful by-product. After the charcoalhad absorbed to its saturation point, it could be pyrolised into water,carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and a host of oxides of other elements, eachof which could be stored or recycled. Alternatively, the spent charcoalcould be assimilated into plant life (probably after some chemicalprocessing).</P><P>The oxygen could be recovered with a similar high efficiency, likely over99%.

One complication isthat all of the biomass would need to be imported from Earth as hydrogenfor water,atmospheric nitrogen, and food, which is then converted into fertilizerfor plants to assimilate into biomass. The biomass would otherwise accumulateto the tune of 0.84 kg each person/day, however, so dedicated importswon't be needed for the short term.

<h2 align="center">Radar System Requirements</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><I>James Garry</I></P>
<P><HR><P>

<P>Radar systems will be used for tracking distances between two objects
several times in the <a href="/adb/04/">Reference Mission</A>. The three
cases considered here are terminal descent, the ascent stage/<a
href="/adb/04/02/01/">lunar transfer vehicle</a> docking, and the final LEO
rendezvous with the <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Shuttle</a>
(or whatever vehicle we use to get the crew back on the ground). Although
for descent, the radar is used primarily for checking the distance to the
lunar surface, in the case of rendezvous the radar system plays is also 
used to find the LTV in the first place. Not considered are laser
altimeters, since they are still somewhat novel, and there's a lot to be
said for using a well-understood and tested, if older, technology (as long
as the mass and power requirements are reasonable)</P>

<P>The requirements of descent and ascent are fairly distinct and so it is
tempting to have two disparate systems rather than a common design.
Here are some fairly preliminary specifications:</P>

<H3>Descent Stage Radar System</H3>
<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2><tr><td>Range
resolution:</td><td>Of order 5m</td></tr>
<tr><td>Range rate res:</td><td>Of order 0.25m/s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Angular res:</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>Range limit:</td><td>Of order 10 km</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass constraints:</td><td>Get it to LLO</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power constraints:</td><td>Must run on <a
href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">Spacehab</a> power for ~30min.</td></tr></table>

<P>Inertial measuring systems can provide data from <a
href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#LLO">LLO</a> to
first-contact for the radar. The pointing requirements are minimal,
as long as the descent stage has inertial rate sensors (start trackers or
any other optical system just don't have the precision, accuracy, and 
speed). The ground-track can be identified with confidence. So, given 
that the descent stage will need attitude control to better than 100 mrad 
if the burns are reasonably accurate, then an antenna with a reasonable 
beamwidth (a few degrees) will need only to be fixed with respect to the 
vehicle for the ground-spot to be accurately identified.</P>

<P>With no pointing mechanism for descent, the requirements then are
similar to an upgraded traffic-cop radar gun that puts out a watt or so 
of RF at a few GHz and draws 10-30W total for under 10 kg including the 
dish, structure, harness, etc. The Apollo module altimeter weighed 16 kg 
and drew 130 W, but <a href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#RF">RF</a> amp 
efficiencies and masses have improved vastly since then.</P>

<H3>Ascent Stage Radar System</H3>

<P>This equipment is bolted onto the structure of the ascent stage, and
provides range-rate and angular fix info to the onboard Attitude and
Control Systems system which drives the single hypergolic engine.</P>

<table border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2><tr><td>Range
resolution:</td><td>Of order 10m</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rate resolution:</td><td>Of order 0.25 m/s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Angular res:</td><td>Relatively fine, of order 20 mradian (&lt;1
degree)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Range limit:</td><td>Of order 10km</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mass constraints:</td><td>Tight, from <a
href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#LLO">LLO</a> to surface and back</td></tr>
<tr><td>Power constraints:</td><td>Tight, ~20min operations</td></tr></table>

<P>Either the radar system actively scans the region (and relies on the
orbiting <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a> just being a
"dumb" target) or the return craft can have a little 1 W transponder
onboard which would make rendezvous a much easier operation by increasing
the signal to noise ratio. This means less mass and less power will be 
required for the same first-contact range.</P>

<P>Unless the LTV can download range and bearing info to the rising
ascent stage, the ascent stage will need a steerable antenna (probably 
articulated) with which it tracks the LTV. Since the descent and ascent 
requirements are so similar, it is tempting to use the ascent stage's 
radar system for the descent. It would mean that the antenna on the 
ascent stage will have a locked look-down position for the descent, and a 
feed into the descent stage's Command Data Management Unit (which is 
harder then it sounds)</P>

<h3>LEO Rendezvous</h3>

<P>After the LTV returns from Lunar Orbit, it performs a braking burn to
enter Low Earth Orbit. From here is must rendezvous with the Space Shuttle,
although this is far less of a problem than the other two radar
applications. The <a href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shutlte.html">Space
Shuttle</a> has a radar systems and amenities (such as fuel to spare) for
rendezvous, so it is likely that the Shuttle will be the only active
vehicle for the LEO rendezvous operation.</P>

<P><a href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#STS">STS</a> has the IRACS onboard
(Integrated Radar and Communications Subsystem). Built by Hughes, this kit
gives a 16 km range with 3m range accuracy, and 30cm/s range rate accuracy
(at 3 sigma). Its pointing info is just as good, giving 8 milli radians,
and angle rates of 0.14 milli radians. It all works at 13-14 GHz, and can
operate in two modes, passive, and active. Passive relies on the target
being dumb metal and gives the above 16 km range, if the target carries a
transponder then this can go up to several hundred km.</P>


<H3>Preferred options</H3>

<P>The <a href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a> should host a
0.1W output homing beacon, weighing approximately 2kg and drawing 10W.</P>

<P>During descent the ascent stage's radar is fixed with the hab's axis and 
acts as a plane altimeter. This would weigh 10-30kg and ~30W total power 
(2-5W output). The weight will be for redundancy, as this is a 
mission-critical component for both the descent and ascent stage.</P>

<P>Once the <a href="/adb/04/02/03/">habitat module</a> has been lowered,
the ascent stage is left on trickle charge, the data ring link is 
disconnected (an ethernet-type connection at most) and the dish mechanism 
is unlocked to give it its tens of degrees of freedom in alt (az control 
is unneccesary if it's a co-planar ascent, so that's one degree of 
freedom less and a few kilograms of motors and gears that we don't need).</P>

<P>Most of the ascent stage specifications are based on (with a 10-20%
decrease in mass and power in most cases) a rendezvous radar proposed
by TRW for an <a href="/adb/e/abbreviations.html#OTV">OTV</a>.</P>

<h3>Landing on the Moon</h3>

<img src="/images/asi199600001.gif" align="left" width="256" height="160" alt="Landing Movie Frame: Landing Image">

<p>The landing stack has separated from the Lunar Transfer Vehicle.  The first Artemis Project lunar landing crew set the LTV to take care of itself as it orbits about 60 nautical miles above the cratered landscape.</p>

<p>From inside the lunar habitat, the crewmembers control their descent to the lunar surface.  The pilot's control station is mounted on the window side of the habitat, oriented so that he has his head up when the spacecraft is oriented vertically.  One of his crewmates monitors their trajectory, calling out height above ground, velocity, range to target.  The other crewmember is controlling cameras: cameras inside the habitat, outside the habitat, and on the lunar surface below.</p>

<a name="stack"></a>
<h3>Why the spacecraft is stacked like that</h3>

<p>The vertical orientation during landing is driven by the way the whole stack is packaged for launch and the flight to the moon.  To land horizontally, we would have to launch the descent stage as a separate package and assemble it to the habitat in space.</p>

<p>Landing the stack vertically also makes it easier to control the craft during this phase of the flight.  To understand this, try balancing a stick on your finger.  If you place the stick horizontally with your finger at its center, you'll find it difficult to keep it from falling.  However, if you stand the stick up vertically on your finger, you can chase it around the room and, with a bit of practice, keep it from falling over.</p>  

<p>It works the same way with spaceships.  The easier it is to control the spacecraft, the less maneuvering fuel we use, and less chance we have of losing control.</p>

<p>During flight, we use small maneuvering rockets control the attitude of the spacecraft.  These little rockets turn on occasionally, whenever the vehicle starts to lean over.  These thrusters work in reponse to control laws written by engineers who are experts in designing dynamic systems.  The control laws tell each thruster how long to burn in response to an error in the vehicle's attitude.  </p>

<p>There are other ways to design the control system.  Instead of using maneuvering thrusters, we can mount the main engines in the descent stage on gimbals, and move them back and forth in respose to errors in the spacecraft's attitude.  If we have precise control over the amount of thrust the engines put out, we also have the option of using small differences in the amount of force from each engine.  </p>

<p>Each of those alternative design approaches has its merits.  However, since the descent stage is used only once during the flight, we've chosen what appears to be the simplest, least expensive system as a starting point for design.  If we rigidly mount the engines to the descent stage frame and get them aligned before we launch the spacecraft from Earth, we eliminate the cost and weight of the gimbal system.  Further study is needed to determine which is really the best approach to controlling the spacecraft.  </p>

<h3>Stabilizing the Module</h3> 

<img src="/images/asi199600002.gif" align="left" width="256" height="160" alt="Landing Movie Frame: Stabilizing the Habitat">

<p>After the descent stage touches down on the surface, it drops a foot to provide a stable platform for leveling the habitat.  After the foot is deployed, the crew does their first <a href="/adb/d/glossary#eva">EVA</a> on the lunar surface.  </p>

<p>In this scenario, the three crewmembers use the habitat's supporting trusswork as a ladder.  They gather at the level of the descent stage's thrust platform.  Here we get a bit creative.  To avoid the question of who was first set foot on the moon after forty years, they hold hands (well, gloves) and jump the last few feet together.<p>

<p>A robotic rover stands nearby, welcoming them to the moon as it records their arrival.  This robot was one of several landed earlier, used to record for the first time a manned landing on the surface of the moon.</p>


<a name="level"></a>
<h3>Leveling the Habitat</h3>

<img src="/images/asi199500027.gif" align="left" width="256" height="160" alt="Landing Movie Frame: Leveling the Habitat">

<p>After a brief ceremony with flags, speeches, and leaping about, the crew gets to work.  One crewmember moves to the foot of the support truss while the others take up positions on either side of the spacecraft.  From these positions they carefully level the support truss.  One at a time, the crew use hand wrenches to make small adjustments to jackscrews which control the length of each of the supporting legs.  While one cremember is cranking a jackscrew, the others are sighting on bubbles of mercury which were meticulously aligned before the spacecraft was launched from Earth.  (And which undoubtedly will get knocked askew before they get to the moon.  Hopefully, the error won't be enough to worry about.)  When the platform is level, they lock the jackscrws in place.</p>

<p>They want to work quickly at this point.  Ever since some time during the descent to the moon they've been inside the "dead man's curve," left without an emergency escape back to lunar orbit and the Lunar Transfer Vehicle that waits to take them home again.  As soon as they get the habitat module rotated out of the way and the plumbing reconfigured for the ascent vehicle, they'll be able to leave the lunar surface on a moment's notice.</p>

<p>The crew monitors the descent of the habit as it rotates from the vertical to horizontal positions.  There are a lot of design considerations in this activity, discussed below under "<a href="#issues">Design Issues</a>."  When the module is completely lowered and the ascent vehicle buttoned up, they're ready to go back into the habitat and set up for several days of housekeeping on the moon.</p>

<a name="issues"></a>
<h3>Design Issues</h3>

<h4>Lunar Habitat Orientation</h4>

<p>The horizontal position gives us more working space and a less claustrophic interior arrangement.  Its additional stability is obvious; though there aren't winds or significant amounts of seismic activity (moonquakes) to worry about, we can generate quite a list of events that might tend to tip the module over.  

<p>It also has a show business advantage of providing greater camera relief; that is, a longer distance from the camera lens to the subject.  This gives us more flexibility in setting the scene for interior shots during the first lunar visit.  The lower profile of the horizontal orientation also will make it easier to use lunar regolith to shield the module for long-term operations.  Finally, rotating the module moves it out of the way of the ascent stage; and from a show-biz standpoint, it looks neat.</p>


<p>On the other hand, leaving the module in the vertical orientation eliminates the cost of developing the mechanism for lowering the support truss and the module; and it eliminates the weight of that extra foot, mechanisms, and supporting trusswork.  That extra weight could be invested in additional equipment and supplies delivered to the moon, increasing our assurance of mission success on later flights.</p>

<p>The current baseline reference mission calls for landing vertically and rotating the module to a horizontal position.  Unless further analysis comes up with a very compelling reason to change this scenario, this is how we'll do it.</p>

<h4>Mechanism for rotating the module</h4>

<p>It's easy to imagine a computer-controlled electric motor lowering the support truss and the habitat to the horizontal position.  After all, that's what spacecraft do.  However, motors and batteries are heavy, and the electronics and software to control this one-time operation are very expensive.</p>

<p>Because of the weight and expense of using an electric motor, it's more likely that we'll build in a hand-operated winch or jack to lower the module.  Or, since we're working in only one-sixth gravity, we might just let it crash and eliminate the extra trusswork altogether.</p>

<p>Further analysis is required to determine the best way to do this.  For now, the reference mission calls for the crew to use a hand-operated winch to lower the moduled.</p>

<h3>Landing Movie</h3>

<p>The images on this page are from an 890K Quicktime movie which shows the major events during this phase of the mission.  Use <a href="/images/asi199500026.qt">this link</a> to download the whole movie from the Artemis Project Imagery Library.  It's a big file, so transferring the data to your computer will take a while.</p>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</h2>
<h2 align="center">9.3. Listserver Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>
Almost all electronic communications for the Artemis Project occur through a
set of topic-oriented mailing lists, each list covering a different
technical or functional area of the Artemis Project.  In addition to the technical and functional mailing lists, a growing number of local chapters of the Artemis Society use electronic mailing lists as their primary way of communicating with each other.  There is also a general discussion forum on the original "<a href="/adb/09/03/artemis-list.html">artemis-list</a>" mailing list, which runs on the LunaCity server.
<p>
The mailing lists that already exist and instructions on joining those lists are included below.  Most of these mailing lists are open, so you're welcome and encouraged to join the ones that interest you.  The plans for future mailing lists can be found in the <a href="/adb/09/03/listserver-rqts.html">
Listservers for Team Communication</a> web page.
<p>
The protocol for joining most electronic mailing lists is to send a command
to the listserver telling it what list you want to join.  The command goes
in the body of your message, and usually it doesn't matter what you put in
the message subject.  The machine learns your email address from the
electronic mail header on your message.  Leaving a mailing list works the
same way, except the command you send is different.
<p>
There are exceptions to all these conventions, of course.  We've noted
exceptions in the list below, but generally the only information you need
to join an electronic mailing list is the address and precise wording of
the command to send.  Each listserver will send a welcome message giving
you more information about how to send other commands to drop off the list,
change your address (if the server allows that; usually they don't), or
find out who else is on the list.
<p>
If you are a member of an Artemis Technical Committee or discussion group and
you don't have a mailing list for your committee or group, follow the
instructions in the <a href="/adb/09/01/ec-procguide.html">Electronic
Communication Procedure Guide</a> to get a mailing list set up.
Previous messages to most of these mailing lists will soon be
available in archives that will be accessible through FTP, e-mail requests, or
web pages.  To find out what's going on to implement these mailing lists and
the archive capability, or to volunteer to help, check out the
<a href="/adb/09/01/ectc_tasks.html#mailinglists">Listserver Mailing Lists</a>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</h2>
<h2 align="center">9. Electronic Communication</h2>

Because of the widespread nature of the
<a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a>
membership, Electronic
Communications is a fundamental part of the
<a href="http://www.asi.org">Artemis Project</a>.  The Artemis
Electronic Communications infrastructure is based on a set of topic-oriented
<a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>,
each mailing list covering a different technical or functional
area of the Artemis Project.  The use of multiple mailing lists keeps the
conversations focused on specific topics and allows everyone to participate in
only those discussions that they are interested in.  To support those members
who do not have access to the mailing lists, or aren't able to keep up with the
volume of mailing lists, there are automated gateways set up between the
mailing lists and numerous other communications environments, including
<a href="/adb/09/05/newsgroups.html">newsgroups</a>,
<a href="/adb/09/06/online-info.html">online services</a>,
<a href="/adb/09/07/bbs-info.html">bulletin boards</a>,
and <a href="/adb/09/04/01/web-conv.html">web pages</a>.  The overall
electronic communications architecture is represented in the drawing below.
To see more information about a particular part of the architecture, click on
the appropriate part of the drawing or select one of the links below the
drawing.

<p>
Much of the above architecture has not been implemented yet.  An overview of
the electronic communication improvements was discussed in an article called
"<a href="01/pleiades.html">Artemis Electronic Communication Improvements</a>"
that was published in the Pleiades section of the January 1996 Moon Miner's
Review newsletter.  The implementation of these communications improvements,
and maintaining the overall electronic communications environment, is the
responsibility of the <a href="01/ectc.html">Electronic Communications
Technical Committee</a> (ECTC).  The specific projects that are going on to
implement these communications improvements are listed in the
<a href="01/ectc_tasks.html">ECTC Task List</a>.  The ECTC is always looking
for help in implementing many of these improvements.  If you are willing to
help, fill out the volunteer form in the <a href="01/ectc_tasks.html">
ECTC Task List</a> page.
<p>
If you are a member of an Artemis Technical Committee or discussion group and
need electronic communications services set up for your committee or group,

Artemis Society Chapters and Affiliates</H1>

<P>At the moment there are no <I>official</I> chapters of the <A
HREF="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</A> because
they're still working out the paperwork.  For instance, to make the banks
and the Texas Secretary of State happy, the <A
HREF="http://www.io.com/~dbrummel/ash/ash.html">Artemis Society of
Houston</A> needs copies of the incorporation papers of Artemis Society
International plus a letter of authorization from ASI.  We're sort of
tinkering with A.S.H. to figure it out, and trying to learn from some of
the sticky problems <A
HREF="http://www.global.org/bfreed/nss/nss-home.html">National Space
Society</A> has had with its local chapters.  (Incidentally, local NSS
chapters can be affiliates of the Artemis Society or sponsors of the <a
href="http://www.asi.org/">Artemis Project</a>.  While NSS is very
broad-scoped, the Artemis Society is focused on the single goal of making
the private lunar community happen.)</P>

<P>So what we have is lots of chapters and affiliates who are getting ready
to make things happen, and partners in travel (like <A HREF="#om">Oregon
Moonbase</a> and the <A HREF="#lrs">Lunar Reclamation Society</a>) who are
already making things happen.</P>

<P>Things are at different stages hither and yon, but there are a few
proto-chapters, affiliate organizations, and fellow lunar development fans
where folks have at least volunteered to be a local contact for the Artemis
Project.  In some cases, folks said they need help from others to get a
group going.</P>

<P>If you see a chapter in your area, please, drop the contact a line and
let the person know that you might come! Many of the listed chapters are
just forming, and nothing is more helpful then knowing if there are
people around that are interested in attending, even infrequently.</P>

This would also help us indeveloping the Grand Financial Plan by providing hard marketing data,something we can show to investors and the SEC.</P><P>If you're in a position to influence your company's decision process and arethinking you might want to sponsor the project, now would be a good time totalk about licenses.

<h2>The Artemis Project is developing a private lunar base.</h2>

<p><b><i>News Flash: </i></b></p>
<p>If you're in Great Britain, watch this week's edition of "Future
Fantastic", hosted by Gillian Anderson.  It's on the BBC at 7:30 PM British
Standard Time, Friday, August 23, 1996.  This episode includes a segment about
the Artemis Project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gpl.net">The Genesis Project</a> is sponsoring an
Internet Relay Chat channel for the Artemis Project.  We expect to have many
of the project's leaders and participants on line, live, after the BBC
broadcast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/tv/tworld/ff8.html">More details about the
Future Fantastic episode</a> are available here on the ASI web.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to participate in the IRC, visit our

<P>A team of non-profit organizations led by the <A

HREF="asi_index.html">Artemis Society International</a>, with the

support of a <A HREF="companyindex.html">team of commercial

companies</a>, is combining its efforts to establish a permanent

self-supporting community on the moon. <EM>You</EM> are invited to

come, too!  For the first time in history, you are invited to

participate directly in manned space flight by lending your talent

and enthusiasm to the project.</P>



<P>When the project is successful, you will be able to <a

href="moonvac.html">travel to the moon and beyond</a>.  <a

href="/asi_member.html">Join us</a> and take the first step on a

journey that need never end.</P>



<P>See our response to <A HREF="/adb/j/index.html">frequently asked

questions</A> to learn how we are able to build a program which up

until now was something only huge government agencies could do.

Some concerns might come up while you're learning about the project.

If so, check out our answers to <A HREF="/adb/j/fro_index.html">frequently

raised objections</A>.</P>



<P><a href="/adb/j/too-risky-for-investors.html">The idea</a> is

to avoid asking people to invest any money directly in the "risky"

business of space flight, but rather to seek investment in associated

ventures in known industries such as making <a

href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemag/artemis-mag.html">publications</a>,

and <a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">merchandising</a>.

The promise of the project is sufficiently entertaining that if we

tell the story well, we'll have enough money to be at <a

href="/adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html">break-even</a> before we

do the <a href="/adb/04/">first launch</a>.</P>



<h3>Getting Involved</h3>



<P>Less than 5% of the work needs to be done by rocket scientists,

so you can <A HREF="Things_You_Can_Do.html">make a significant

contribution</A> to the development of manned space flight even if

you don't have a PhD in astronautics.</P>


<h3>Artemis Data Book</h3>



<P>All the information about the project is stored in the <A

HREF="http://www.asi.org/adb/outline.html">Artemis Data Book</A>.

The Data Book has had over 400 new files since February, and is

the main repository of completed technical documents. Some hilights

include essays on <a href="/adb/04/03/10/04/oxygen-extraction.html">oxygen

extraction</a>, <a href="/adb/02/09/he3-intro.html">helium-3

<H3>Shameless Commercialism</H3>



<P>Our <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">on-line catalog</A>

has an ever-growing list of Artemis Project trinkets that you must

have.  Check the special deal on Lunar Transfer Vehicles, available

for a limited time only!</P>



<P>We also have a <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Poster.html">poster</A>

with illustrations of what the <A

HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Reference_mission.html">reference

mission</A> spacecraft look like.</P>



<H3>Electronic Communication</H3>



<p>One of the greatest challenges for the project is having a huge

team spread out all over the world.  We keep in touch through

extensive use of electronic communication.  You're standing at the

tip of the iceberg, at the main entrance to the Artemis Project's

World Wide Web Site.</p>



<p>Discussion groups, <a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">mailing

and all the rest are described in <a href="/adb/09/overview.html">

section 9 of the Artemis Data Book</a>.</p>



<H3>The Artemis Society Near You</H3>



<P>People around the world are interested in the project and are

forming local chapters.  We have a list of them so you can find <A

HREF="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">people in your neighborhood</A>

to discuss forming a chapter and helping the project.  If you're

interested and there isn't a local contact near, you send email to

<A  hREF="mailto:asi@asi.org">&lt;asi@asi.org&gt;</A> about getting

listed as a local contact or about forming a chapter. If you are

also part of a pro-space organization email us about <a

<H3>Guestbook</H3>



<P>If you're interested in the Artemis Project please sign our <A

HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/guestbook.html">guestbook</A>.</P>



<P><b><i>A Little Secret</i></b></P>



<p>Every night, just after midnight Eastern U.S. time, our machine

updates its list of files that have changed in the past 24 hours.

This <a href="/whatsnew.html">whatsnew</a> page might seem bewildering

at first, especially since many of the files you see in the list

are pages we're still developing (guaranteed not to make much

sense), but as you become a veteran lunar explorer it will become

a valuable tool for keeping up with the Artemis Project.  </p>

<h2>The Artemis Project is developing a private lunar base.</h2>

<p><b><i>News Flash: </i></b></p>
<p>If you're in Great Britain, watch this week's edition of "Future
Fantastic", hosted by Gillian Anderson.  It's on the BBC at 7:30 PM British
Standard Time, Friday, August 23, 1996.  This episode includes a segment about
the Artemis Project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gpl.net">The Genesis Project</a> is sponsoring an
Internet Relay Chat channel for the Artemis Project.  We expect to have many
of the project's leaders and participants on line, live, after the BBC
broadcast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/tv/tworld/ff8.html">More details about the
Future Fantastic episode</a> are available here on the ASI web.</p>

<H3>Shameless Commercialism</H3>



<P>Our <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">on-line catalog</A>

has an ever-growing list of Artemis Project trinkets that you must

have.  Check the special deal on Lunar Transfer Vehicles, available

for a limited time only!</P>



<P>We also have a <A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Poster.html">poster</A>

with illustrations of what the <A

HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/Reference_mission.html">reference

mission</A> spacecraft look like.</P>



<H3>Electronic Communication</H3>



<p>One of the greatest challenges for the project is having a huge

team spread out all over the world.  We keep in touch through

extensive use of electronic communication.  You're standing at the

tip of the iceberg, at the main entrance to the Artemis Project's

World Wide Web Site.</p>



<p>Discussion groups, <a href="/adb/09/03/mailing-lists.html">mailing

lists</a>, <a href="/adb/09/06/01/genie.html">on-line services</a>,

and all the rest are described in <a href="/adb/09/overview.html">

section 9 of the Artemis Data Book</a>.</p>



<H3>The Artemis Society Near You</H3>



<P>People around the world are interested in the project and are

forming local chapters.  We have a list of them so you can find <A

HREF="/adb/07/local-chapters.html">people in your neighborhood</A>

to discuss forming a chapter and helping the project.  If you're

interested and there isn't a local contact near, you send email to

<A  hREF="mailto:asi@asi.org">&lt;asi@asi.org&gt;</A> about getting

listed as a local contact or about forming a chapter. If you are

also part of a pro-space organization email us about <a

href="/adb/10/sponsorship.html">affiliating with ASI</a>.</P>



<H3>Guestbook</H3>



<P>If you're interested in the Artemis Project please sign our <A

HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/guestbook.html">guestbook</A>.</P>



<P><b><i>A Little Secret</i></b></P>



<p>Every night, just after midnight Eastern U.S. time, our machine

updates its list of files that have changed in the past 24 hours.

This <a href="/whatsnew/whatsnew.html">whatsnew</a> page might seem bewildering

at first, especially since many of the files you see in the list

are pages we're still developing (guaranteed not to make much

sense), but as you become a veteran lunar explorer it will become

a valuable tool for keeping up with the Artemis Project.  </p>

<HTML><HEAD> <TITLE>2.7  What is the Luna City Hotel like?</TITLE> </HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section 2.7 Recreation and Tourism --><!-- file: /adb/02/07/lunacity-hotel.html --><!-- Keywords: mass marketing money payment funds  --><h2 align="center">Artemis Data Book</H2><h2 align="center">2.7 Recreation and Tourism</H2><h2 align="center"> What is the Luna City Hotel like?</H2><P><HR><P><P> Go forward in time to the point where we're manufacturing living quartersfrom lunar materials and can build a large tourist hotel.  A 50-passenger SSTOlaunches from Earth with its crew of 4 (two pilots, two flight attendants).The SSTO gets refueled in LEO and flies on to the moon.  There it exchangesits passengers for folks coming home after a week of fun and play.</P><P> Rethinking the amortization cost of the SSTO vehicles, the cost of the one-week trip goes up to $96,000.  That's amortizing it on Japanese terms, wherethe cost of money is about 5% per year.  A group of Japaense companies isalready working on this vehicle, so it has a chance of happening.  They'retalking about a fleet of 50 vehicles, each making one 2-orbit flight 300 daysa year.  In other words, airline-style operations.</P><P> To house all those tourists, we'll need a 350-bed hotel, plus perhapsanother12 beds for the transient flight crews.  We'll need racks of space suits sofolks can play outside, and a fleet of pressurized buses to take them ontours of the sights.</P><P> Assuming a packing rate of 2 people per room, we need 175 rooms for thetourists and maybe another 12 for the support troops; 187 guest rooms total.</P><P> Let's go luxury class.  On Earth, maids are expected to do 20 rooms aday, sowe need 10 maids.  How many maintenance folks?  5 sounds right.  3 managers, 3desk clerks, 1 general manager.  32 folks working food service. 12 working thebars.  2 working the souvenir counter.  18 tour guides.  Total staff: 86.</P><P> Making some assumptions about how the staff shares rooms, we're up to 230rooms.</P><P> The staff doubles as security.  Who's gonna break into a hotel on the<I>moon</I>?And if folks steal our towels for souvenirs, they'd better leave an equal massof good Earth stuff behind or they won't make their weigh-in for the returntrip.</P><P> To feed all these people, we'll need quite an agriculture industry;trees andbees and plants and ants and worms and birds because they're pretty; cattleand chickens and a flock of smelly sheep.  Tours of the lunar farms areincluded in the package.</P><P> By the time we're done, we'll be up to a total population of 500, and that'sjust for the hotel.</P><P> The average staff member stays a year and costs us $200,000 a year, dividedevenly between transportation costs and burdened labor rate.  We're spending$82,000 a day for staff, or $234 per paying guest per day.  Add in some reallyoptimistic costs for amortizing the facility costs because it was all built byrobotics from lunar material (unbridled optimism, that), and the rooms will gofor $1,500 a day, meals and recreation included.</P><P> But hey, you've already paid $96,000 for your ticket on the rocket, sowhat'sa measly $9,000 for the rest of the package? Thus our profit margin.</P><P> Go ahead and steal the towels.

<P><HR><P>


<h3>Define Requirements of SSTO</h3>

<P>The first step in creating a vehicle is knowing what it must do. Here
the requirements are laid out in detail, so that the strawman design can be
made reflecting them. The requirements are subject to little change after
being set.</P>

<ul>
<li>1. Mission Design

<ul>
<li>1.1. Delta-V Requirements
<li>1.2. Refueling Requirements
<li>1.3. Aerobraking Requirements
<li>1.4. Supplementary Hydrogen Capacity
</ul>

<li>2. Spacecraft Requirements

<ul>
<li>2.1. Payload Capacity
<li>2.2. Passenger Capacity
<li>2.3. Acceleration
<li>2.4. Structure Fraction
</ul>

<li>Operations Requirements

<ul>
<li>Turnaround Time
<li>Operating Cost
<li>Safety
<li>Reusability
</ul>
</ul>

<P><HR><P>
<h3>Create Preliminary Strawman Design</h3>

<P>Once we have the requirements of the passenger SSTO, we then draw up a
preliminary design. This, of course, is always being modified when it is
found to lead to excessive air drag, or an unreasonable mass-ratio, or some
other flaw. It is then changed to reflect the data, and the new design is
checked until the spacecraft meets or exceeds all the requirements.</P>



<P><HR><P>
<H3>Detail Design, Mass, Performance, Cost</H3>

<P>Here we take the strawman design, and expand it, and detail its systems
to get an accurate idea of its performance, cost, and basically how well it
compares to the requirements. Where it falls short (for example, having 
an insufficient payload after a modification), a change is recommended and
the strawman design is altered (for example, replacing the structure with
composites and increasing the vehicle size).</P>

<H3>Coordinate with other Technical Committees</H3>

<P>The SSTO to the moon project is essential to the long-term future of
lunar development. Because of its importance, it is essential to keep other
technical committees up-to-date as to the current design, requirements,
payload, and other topics of interest so the other Technical Committees can
do their work accurately. Other groups will be added as they get
organized.</P>

Today he serves as chairman of the board and president of The<A HREF="http://www.tlrc.com/">Lunar Resources Company</A>, a member of theboard of directors of Artemis Society International, chairman of the ArtemisProject Board of Advisors, and director of the Artemis Society International's <a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/06/07/osf-index.html">Office of Space Flight</a>.</p><hr><h3>Summary:</h3><p>Gregory R. Bennett has 23 years of experience in aerospace engineering,with responsibilities ranging from management to detailed technicalanalysis.  He is the founder of several successful non-profit organizations(including the Artemis Society), and writes science fiction under thecleverly disguised pseudonym of Gregory Bennett.</p><hr><h3>Work experience:</h3><p>Greg has worked in manned space flight engineering at the <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/">Johnson SpaceCenter</a> since 1979.  In his day job, he is responsible for EVA engineeringon the <a href="http://issa-www.jsc.nasa.gov/index.shtml">International Space Station</a> program.  He has worked for <a href="http://www.mdc.com/">McDonnell Douglas</a> since1972 in Space Shuttle astronaut and mission controller training, spacestation operations planning, and lately as manager for space station EVAassembly and maintenance development.</p><p>He moved to the Johnson Space Center in Houston in 1979 to take the jobof operations supervisor on the Space Shuttle Procedures Simulator the forLink Flight Simulation Division of the Singer Company (now CAE/Link).After the first flight of the Space Shuttle, the Smithsonian came to pickup the aging simulator, and Greg moved to McDonnell Douglas to escape frombeing reassigned to manager of a helicopter simulator.</p><p>Prior to his employment in manned space flight, Greg spent seven yearsat the <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial.airplanes.html">Boeing Commercial Airplane Company</a> in Seattle, where he participatedin exploratory design of commercial jet aircraft and development of theYC-14, the USAF's prototype advanced medium STOL transport.  At Boeing hedeveloped aircraft flight controls, evaluated aircraft handling qualities,stability, and control, and taught courses in modern control theory andcomputer operating systems.  When he left Boeing to follow the lure ofmanned space flight, he was director of training for Boeing's FlightControls Laboratories.</p><p>He put himself through college by working as a lab technician at AdmiralCorporation refrigeration laboratory and the Knox College physicsdepartment, taught freshman physics, and did sundry odd jobs.</p><hr><h3>Organizational experience:</h3><p>Greg has extensive experience and success in running largeorganizations. In 1976 he founded the Northwest L5 Society, the first localchapter of the National Space Society.  That same year he founded theNorthwest Science Fiction Society, which sponsors <a href="http://www.seanet.com/Users/warlock/norwescon.html">Norwescon</a>, the Northwestregional science fiction convention.  He served as chairman of the firstthree Norwescons.  He also started served as the editor of Westwindmagazine, and was chairman of the Seattle bidding committee for the 1981World Science Fiction Convention.  These activities continued after hemoved to Houston with participation in the operation of most World ScienceFiction Conventions for the next several years.  He was Director of SpecialInterest Programs at Chicon IV, the 1982 Worldcon.</p><p>He founded the Artemis Society in 1994 and served as its leader untilthe organization was formally established as a non-profit educational andscientific foundation with its headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama.</p><hr><h3>Education:</h3><p>Greg started college life majoring in Physics major at <a href="http://www.knox.edu">Knox College</a> inGalesburg, Illinois, 1968-1970.  In 1969, he became concerned that therewere no jobs in Physics, so he transferred to the <ahref="http://www.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois</a> to studyAeronautical and Astronautical Engineering; just in time for the biggestaerospace industry crash in history.  He received his Bachelor of Sciencein January 1973.</p><hr><h3>Personal stuff:</h3> <p>Greg was born in Independence, Kansas on March 12, 1950, the son of aDisciples of Christ minister and a hospital nurse.  He is the third of fourchildren. While Greg was still an infant, his family moved to Virginia.</p><p>He was in the third grade in Alexandria, the Virginia part of theDistrict of Columbia diamond, when NASA was formed in late 1958.  Aboutonce a month NASA speakers from Washington, D.C. would come to hone theirskills on the neighborhood schoolkids.  The message of the government spaceprogram back then was how good it was going to be when everyone could workand live in space. Greg never forgot that promise, even after thegovernment abandoned these goals to pursue their race to the moon.</p><p>His personal interests and hobbies are as eclectic as anyone's: spaceflight, history, philosophy, psychology, private pilot, backpacking,computer programming, astronomy, photography, astrophysics, ecology,geology, FRP games, graphics design, foreign languages, all kinds of music,and of course, surfing the net.</p><p>Greg lives in League City, Texas with his wife, <AHREF="/bios/bennett.melva.html">Melva</A>, their 7-year-old son, Alexander,and the family dog, Archimedes.</p><hr><UL><li> <a href="grb-bibliography.html">Gregory BennettBibliography</a><li> <a href="grb-honors.html">Yesterday's Glories:  Awards,Recognition, Organizations</a><li><a href="grb-engagements.html">Speaking Engagements onSpace Program Topics</a><li><a href="http://www.io.com/~grb/index.html">Greg's Place on the Web</a></UL><!-- Nav Bar --><hr size = 5><table align=center border=4 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2><tr>  <td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/index.html">Artemis Project</a></b>  <td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/asi_index.html"> Artemis Society</a></b>  <td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/index.html"> Artemis Data Book</a></b>  <td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/j/index.html"> FAQ</a></b>  <td align=center> <b><a href="/adb/04/index.html"> Reference Mission</a></b>  <td align=center> <b><a href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html"> Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size = 5><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society Interational.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Artemis Project Frequently Raised Objections</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section J Frequent --><!-- file: /adb/j/reference-mission.html --><h2 align="center">Artemis Project Frequently Asked Questions</H2><h2 align="center">What is the Reference Mission Plan?</H2><P><HR><P><h3>Artemis Project Reference Mission</h3><P>We are planning many flights to the moon; however, one flight has thedistinction of being named "<a target="_top" href="/adb/04/">the referencemission</a>."  This is the flight which places the initial core of theexploration base on the moon and establishes the transportation system tosupport it.  We use the reference mission to determine <a target="_top"href="/adb/03/01/cost-breakdown.html">costs</a>, <a target="_top"href="/adb/03/01/revenue-breakdown.html">revenues</a>, and <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/">technical</a> and <a target="_top"href="/adb/03/05/">political issues</a> to establish that critical footholdon the moon.</P><h3>Access to Orbit</h3><P>The role of Artemis Project spacecraft Reference Mission starts andends in low earth orbit.  To get up there, we use <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/01/01/01/">launch services</a> developed outside theproject.</P><P>A host of <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/">launchers</a> areavailable today, and many more are being developed, to get our hardware andcrew into earth orbit.  The <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Space Shuttle</a> was selected asthe launcher for the reference mission because, although it is the mostexpensive launch system in the world today, it is also the most capableman-rated launcher.</P><P>Current development of new lower-cost launchers in the United States andother countries will most likely change the situation  before the ArtemisProject reference mission is ready to launch. Until then the Shuttle is thebest vehicle which can satisfy all our mission requirements.  Also, we arebeing as conservative as we reasonably can in defining the <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/">reference mission</a>.  If costs and revenues balance usingthe Space Shuttle, then they will look even better with a less expensivelauncher.</P><P>Two launches put the components moon-bound spacecraft into low Earthorbit, where the vehicle is assembled.  Our crew goes up with the hardwareon the second flight.</P><h3>Artemis Project Spacecraft</h3><P>If the <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/01/01/01/option-5-iss.html">International Space Station</a>is available and the launcher can deliver our spacecraft to it, we plan touse the space station as a staging base.  If not, we launch the firstelement on one flight and then rendezvous with it on the next flight.  Inthat case our crew uses the Shuttle as a staging base for assembling theArtemis spacecraft.</P><P><a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/01/option-6-leo-node.html">Anotheralternative</a> being studied is to deploy our own staging facility in alow-inclination orbit.</P><P><CENTER><img width=354 height=224 src="/images/asi199600098.gif"alt="Artemis Project Stack at Translunar Injection"></CENTER><P><P>There are three distinct spacecraft in the reference mission:</P><blockquote><P><a target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a> -- asmall spaceborne habitat with propulsion systems and support for the crewduring flight between Earth and the moon.  The current design concept forthe Lunar Transfer Vehicle uses the <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/03/06/01/">SPACEHAB module</a> as its crew compartment.</P><P><CENTER><img width=343 height=145 src="/images/asi199600099.gif"alt="Lunar Transfer Vehicle"></CENTER><P><P>For information about the SPACEHAB laboratory, the world's first (andonly) commercially developed manned spacecraft, visit <a target="_top"href="http://www.spacehab.com">http://www.spacehab.com</a>.</P><P>Descent Stage + <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/03/">Lunar Base CoreModule</a> -- a propulsion package attached to the core module'spressurized habitat lands it on the surface of the moon.  The explorationbase manned element is based on using three SPACEHAB modules connected intandem.</P><P><CENTER><img width=496 height=307 src="/images/asi199600097.gif"alt="Lunar Habitat and Descent Stage being leveled on the LunarSurface"></CENTER><P><P><B>Ascent Stage</B> -- a simple, open vehicle to return the space-suitedcrew from the lunar surface to the orbiting lunar transfervehicle.</P></blockquote><P><CENTER><img width=229 height=146 src="/images/asi199600095.gif"alt="Ascent Stage Diagram"></CENTER><P><P>These three spacecraft make up the stack which is flown to the moon.After the stack is assembled at the space station, the lunar transfervehicle's rockets are used to fly to the moon and enter orbit about 60miles above the lunar surface.  The reference mission uses a trajectorysimilar to the Apollo flights.</P><P><CENTER><img width=322 height=85 src="/images/asi199600096.gif"alt="Reference Mission Trajectory Diagram"></CENTER></P><P>Upon arrival in lunar orbit, the lunar base habitat with its descentrockets separates from the lunar transfer vehicle and lands on the surfaceof the moon.</P><P>The favored <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/03/">landing site</a>is an area of Mare Anguus we have dubbed "Angus Bay."  On a map of themoon, you'll find this area just northeast of Mare Crisium.  In Earth'snorthern hemisphere, you'll see a dark spot near the top of the moon as itrises in the east. That dark spot is Mare Crisium.  Our landing site isjust at the top of that dark spot.</P><P><CENTER><img width=360 height=180 src="/images/asi199600044.gif"alt="Cylindrical Map of the Moon with 'Angus Bay' Marked"></CENTER><P><P>The lunar transfer vehicle remains in its orbit around the moon.Advances in automation technology and guidance and control systems sincethe Apollo program allow the lunar transfer vehicle to remain unmannedwhile the crew goes down to the moon's surface. Automated guidance canhandle the necessary <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/02/mission-timeline.html">orbit circularization and planechange</a> without the need for a human on board.  This eliminates the needto fly a separate LTV pilot, and allows all crewmembers to go down to themoon.</P><P>On the moon, the crew levels the lunar base core.  After landingvertically, the descent stack drops a foot at the end of a long truss tobrace against, and then the core module rotates into position.  An <atarget="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/04/day-01.html">illustrated discussion ofthis operation</a> is available in the on-line <a target="_top"href="/adb/">Artemis Data Book</a>.</P><P>The crew conducts extravehicular activity to assay the site and gathersamples of the lunar regolith (moon dirt). The crew also sets up cameras toget stock footage of the site and their activities, as well as to recordtheir ascent and the arrival of the next flight. (They film activitiesthroughout the flight, both stock footage and scripted scenes for later usein movies and documentaries.)</P><P>When surface activities are complete, the crew boards the ascent stagefor a two-hour flight to rendezvous with the orbiting lunar transfervehicle.  During the flight our crewmembers depend on their space suits forlife support.  The flight should pose no greater hazard to the crew thantwo hours of surface EVA.</P><P><CENTER><img width=228 height=129 src="/images/asi199600094.gif"alt="Large Ascent Stage Diagram"></CENTER><P><P>After docking the ascent stage to the LTV, our moon explorers return toEarth orbit.  Unlike <a target="_top" href="/adb/m/02/07/">Apollo</a>, theydo not enter directly into Earth's atmosphere.  Instead, they expend morefuel to brake their trajectory and enter Earth orbit for a rendezvous withthe International Space Station.</P><P>Carrying fuel for the final braking to Earth orbit reduces the size ofthe base we can leave on the moon, but there are several advantages whichappear to outweigh that cost.  By leaving the transportation system inorbit for use on later flights, we lower the cost of future development.It also reduces the cost of the initial flight by eliminating the need todevelop a vehicle which can operate in the atmosphere, and trades theweight of the additional fuel for the weight of the heat shield which wouldbe required for atmospheric entry.  An <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/01/01/07/01/aerobraking-feasibility.html">alternative to using rockets</a> for braking to Earth orbit would be to usea heat shield as a aerobrake; however, aerobraking technology is still inthe early development stage and the expense of developing it is beyond theanticipated capital resources of the Artemis Project.</P><P>At the space station, the crew secures the LTV and ascent stage. The LTVmay be used at the space station for additional laboratory space betweenflights, or it may be leased for <a target="_top" href="/adb/05/04/">otherspace operations</a>.  Among the proposals we've received is to fly the LTVon a mission to a <a target="_top" href="/adb/05/04/01/">Near-EarthAsteroid</a>.  With additional fuel tanks plus food and air for the crew,it could perform this mission with little modification.</P><P>Once the Artemis Project vehicles have been secured at the spacestation, the crew returns to Earth on the next available Shuttle flight.It is possible (but not necessary) to conduct the entire moon flight in oneShuttle flight, with the crew flying to same orbiter up and then back downto Earth's surface.</P><P>The mission is not over once the crew goes home.  To survive the cold,2-week-long lunar night, the moon base will need a lot of insulation.  Byburying the core module in moon dirt, we provide the necessary insulationas well as protection from radiation and meteoroids.  A <a target="_top"href="/adb/04/02/05/04/">robot rover</a>, landed ahead of the initial lunarbase, is included in the mission plan for this purpose.  Since the lunarbase can survive several lunar nights using just its heaters, this machinedoes not need to be very large.  We can take several months to lay ablanket over the habitat.</P><P><CENTER><img width=233 height=77 src="/images/asi199600092.gif"alt="Telerobot Burying Lunar Habitat"><P><img width=309 height=96 src="/images/asi199600093.gif" alt="TelerobotFinished Burying Lunar Habitat"></CENTER><P><P>With this robot, we may also be able to photograph our spacecraft'sinitial descent to the lunar surface.  This will be first time any vehiclehas been recorded landing on the moon.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><FONT SIZE=1><a target="_top"href="index.html">[home]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<ahref="what-are-goals.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<ahref="private-afford.html">-&gt;</a></FONT><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/adb/04/index.html">ReferenceMission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top"href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Aug 20, 1996<br>Content by<a target="_top" href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">GregoryR.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Artemis Project Frequently Raised Objections</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><!-- Artemis Data Book section J Frequent --><!-- file: /adb/j/private-afford.html --><h2 align="center">Artemis Project Frequently Asked Questions</H2><h2 align="center">How can private enterprise afford to build a moon base?</H2><P><HR><P><h3> Costs</h3><P>Previous moon base studies have based their cost models on theperformance of government projects and assumed revenues would come onlyafter decades of development.  The resulting high capital costs and longterm before realizing any profit made it <a target="_top"href="/adb/03/03/why-investment-fails.html">impossible for privateenterprise</a> to finance a manned space venture.  The Artemis Projectaddresses both the cost and revenues issues.  Because this is privateenterprise venture, we can reduce development costs by designing thespacecraft to commercial aerospace industry standards, and <a target="_top"href="/adb/03/03/">financing</a> becomes realistic because the projectoffers an immediate return for the investment.</P><P>Analysis of government-sponsored space projects shows that no more than10% of the money, usually even less, is actually spent on developing andoperating the spacecraft.  The rest goes to the enormous support effort andinefficient organizations necessary to answer the changing whims of the U.S. Congress, support a large institutional bureaucracy with extensive fixedassets all over the world, and to adapt to the government'smanagement-by-meetings philosophy.  While some of these extra costs can betrimmed, most of the overhead is the inevitable nature of governmentprograms.</P><P>Private enterprise does not, and could not, work that way.  Byorganizing as a private company, acquiring resources no sooner thannecessary, using the project schedule as a working tool rather thanworshipping it, and refusing to allow the project to lose sight of itsgoals in favor of implementing some politician's social agenda, the costsof any program can be reduced by a factor of ten or more.  Additionally,the Artemis Project reduces its costs by using technology and resourcesalready developed in previous manned space flight programs.</P><P>Our current estimate of the total cost of the space flight programthrough completion of the reference mission is <a target="_top"href="/adb/03/01/cost-analysis.html">US$1.421 billion</a>. This level ofinvestment is quite common in the business world. For example, one newdeep-water oil rig typically costs about one billion dollars.</P><h3>Revenues</h3><P>To most people, manned space flight is just another kind ofentertainment, and really nothing more.  That's the good news! The economicpower of the entertainment industry is enormously greater than allaerospace endeavors combined.  The Artemis Project pays for the initiallunar base primarily by exploiting the entertainment value of the grandadventure of space flight. Once we're on the moon, we continue developingthe lunar community with entertainment and tourism.</P><P>It takes a lot money to build a moon base, but the adventure is so muchfun that net revenues from the entertainment value of the project, throughits first flight, is more than US$5 billion. This is the immediate return;it does not include the profit to be made in the long run by exploitinglunar resources.  These <a target="_top" href="/adb/03/04/">revenue</a>estimates are based on comparison to similar mass-marketing ventures whichtie movies and television shows in with associated merchandise andservices.</P><P>Our challenge is to make the program fun.  Fun, not just for thecommunity of space enthusiasts who already share the vision, but for thevast market of people all over the world who think of space travel as thesubject of big government programs and science fiction movies.</P><P>The <a target="_top"href="/adb/m/02/07/nasa-apollo-overview.html">Apollo program</a> was runwith engineering precision, its drama hidden by the need for a governmentagency to present an unflagging image of confidence to the world.  In starkcontrast, The Artemis Project is designed to be entertaining from thestart. With half a dozen science fiction writers already working on theproject, we think it is very likely we will attain that goal and stillretain the project's major appeal which sets it apart from science fictionproductions -- the Artemis Project is real.</P><P>In short, we plan to pay for the initial stages of the project throughshameless commercialism.</P><!-- Nav Bar --><FONT SIZE=1><a target="_top"href="index.html">[home]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<ahref="reference-mission.html">&lt;-</a>&nbsp;<ahref="dd-harriman.html">-&gt;</a></FONT><hr size="5"><table align=center border=4 cellpadding = 3 cellspacing=2><tr><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/index.html">ArtemisProject</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/asi_index.html">ArtemisSociety</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/adb/index.html">ArtemisData Book</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/adb/j/index.html">FAQ</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top" href="/adb/04/index.html">ReferenceMission</a></b><td align=center> <b><a target="_top"href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">Catalog</a></b></tr></table><hr size="5"><font size=-2>Copyright &#169; 1996 Artemis Society International.Updated Tue, Aug 20, 1996<br>Content by<a target="_top" href="/bios/bennett.gregory.html">GregoryR.

<h2 align="center">Artemis Project Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<h2 align="center">Why "Artemis"?</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>Early in the project, we decided to go back to the tradition of taking
names for manned space programs from ancient mythology. Mercury, Gemini,
and <a target="_top" href="/adb/m/02/07/">Apollo</a> carried human beings to
the moon in less than ten years, but manned space programs lost sight of
their exploratory nature and fell into lethargic bureaucracy when they
adopted more pedestrian names like Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and the Space
Station.</P>

<P><a target="_top" href="/bios/artemis-bio.html">Artemis</a> is the twin
sister of Apollo in Greek mythology.  She is the moon, and Apollo is the
sun.  Artemis is also goddess of the hunt, a constant reminder that our
project is a voyage of exploration, a venture which will live off the land
in its travels and return products of great value to our home on Earth.</P>

<P>Although her name is not yet quite a
household word, <a target="_top"
href="/adb/03/05/trademark-%22artemis%22.html"> Artemis</a> is one of the
more popular Greek goddesses.  Her
name appears as an acronym on a scheduling software package, a small
European standard satellite program, as the nickname for NASA's robotic
lander in the Common Lunar Lander Study conducting during the days of the
Space Exploration Initiative, on a line of time pieces, several lines of
ladies' intimate apparel, and at least one Greek restaurant in practically
every city in the world.</P>

<h2 align="center">What is The Artemis Project doing now?</H2>
<P><HR><P>


<P><a target="_top" href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society
International</a> is the primary public forum for participating directly in
the space flight project.  This non-profit foundation, incorporated in
Alabama, has local groups in every English-speaking country in the world,
as well as all the Scandinavian nations and other European nations.  Quite
literally, the sun never sets on the Artemis Project; there is no dark side
to the moon.</P>

<P>On the commercial side of the Artemis Project, several business ventures
are under way, ranging from publication of <a target="_top"
href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemag/">Artemis Magazine</a> to development of
commercial computer software.  Story lines are being developed to present
the Artemis Project to everyone, to share the vision and the fun.</P>

<P>We have not been actively seeking publicity, because we're really not
yet ready to deal with it yet.  However, word of the Artemis Project has
spread all the way around the globe.  Most of the growth in the program's
popular appeal has been through the unadvertised World Wide Web site at <a
target="_top" href="http://www.asi.org/">http://www.asi.org</a>.  The first
article about the project in a professional publication appeared in January
1995 issue of Analog magazine.  An article in the <a target="_top"
href="http://www.tlrc.com/Newspaper_Article.html">Dallas Morning News</a>
was syndicated and appeared in hundreds of newspapers in the United States.
The project was the subject of one chapter of the book, FREE SPACE!, by B.
Alexander Howerton. The local television news program found us out when we
had a <a target="_top" href="/artemis95.html">conference in Huntsville</a>,
Alabama last year; and this year the BBC came to our <a target="_top"
href="/artemis96.html">conference in Houston</a> to film a segment about
the Artemis Project for their program "<a target="_top"
href="http://www.bbcnc.org.uk/tv/tworld/future.html">Future Fantastic</a>,"
hosted by actress Gillian Anderson.  Other television producers in Europe,
Australia, and Japan are working on segments about the project.</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Project Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<h2 align="center">Does The Artemis Project support low-cost access to
space?</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>Absolutely! Our <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/">reference mission</a>
is based on use of the <a target="_top"
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/01/shuttle.html">Space Shuttle</a> for <a
target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/01/">access to low Earth orbit</a>.  This
reference mission is being used for determining technical and cost
feasibility; but many new launchers currently under development promise
dramatically lower launch costs.  This in turn increases our chances of
success with the project.  New launchers could increase the initial profit
to stunning proportions both by lowering launch costs and increasing the
project's entertainment value.</P>

<P>One of the primary goals of the project is to become a customer for
low-cost launchers.  If we are successful in exploiting lunar resources, we
will help build the space traffic model to cost-effective proportions.  One
of our major direct goals is to create a market for <a target="_top"
href="/adb/02/07/01/02/">commercial passenger flights to the moon</a>.</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Project Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<h2 align="center">Is the International Space Station important to the
Artemis Project?</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>The International Space Station program adds significantly to our
chances of success.  While it might be possible to develop the Artemis
Project <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/">space vehicles</a> and conduct
the reference mission scenario without the space station, we really would
rather not leave home without it.  There are several reasons for this.</P>

<P>Without a space station, it is extremely unlikely that low-cost,
man-rated launchers will be developed any time in the near future.</P>

<P>The Artemis Project's vehicles and moon base are based on using designs
and technology developed for the International Space Station Program.
Elements of the space station's habitats, power, cooling, communications,
propulsion, and thermal control systems are all directly applicable to
project with little modification. This reduces the project's costs.</P>

<P>The basic mission scenario calls for using the International Space
Station as a <a target="_top"
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/option-5-iss.html">staging base</a> for the flight
to moon.  We could do the mission during a <a target="_top"
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/option-1-shuttle.html">single Shuttle flight</a>,
with the Shuttle loitering in low Earth orbit while Artemis flies to the
moon and back; but the time windows are very tight.  Or we could build our
own <a target="_top"
href="/adb/04/01/01/01/option-6-leo-node.html">servicing facility</a> in a
low-inclination orbit, with some increase in our program cost; we are still
studying whether this option would cost less than using the space
station.</P>

<P>A space station allows the Artemis Project spacecraft to be assembled
and checked out in low Earth orbit, where they can wait for replacement
hardware to arrive if need be.  It also provides an orbiting base for the
<a target="_top" href="/adb/04/02/01/">Lunar Transfer Vehicle</a>.</P>

<P>Finally, the primary mission of the International Space Station is vital
to the outlook for long-term development of space. Scientific research on
the effects of prolonged weightlessness on people, plants, and animals will
teach us how to protect the  health of those who live in space.  We don't
know how the experience of weightlessness will compare to the 1/6 gravity
of the moon; but if the problems are solved on the space station, they will
be solved for all space travel ventures to come.</P>

<h2 align="center">Artemis Project Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<h2 align="center">Where is the project now?</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>We're just a bit past the viewgraph engineering stage, moving into
conceptual design and selecting sources for the major portions of the
spacecraft hardware.  Most of this is being done by volunteers, <a
target="_top"
href="/asi_member.html">members</a> of the <a target="_top"
href="/asi_index.html">Artemis Society</a> around the world; but a
significant portion of the work is being accomplished in anticipation of
the commercial businesses being developed in parallel.</P>

<P>Several items in the "Moonbase Artemis" and "Artemis Project" product
lines are available now, and many others are being developed by a
world-wide team of commercial enterprises.  Keep an eye on <a target="_top"
href="http://www.tlrc.com/catalog.html">the online catalog</a> for
details.</P>

<P>Our feasibility study is looking at technical, political, and financial
issues in more detail to see if we can discover a fatal flaw in the
plan.</P>

<P>We've discussed the technical arena already in this paper.  To
summarize: <a target="_top" href="/adb/04/">technically</a>, we have run
out of show-stoppers.</P>

<P><a target="_top" href="/adb/03/03/">Financial</a> issues have moved past
the initial feasibility study. Now the major issues are the program
implementation plan (who does what and when), and the best methods for
capitalizing the space flight and attendant business ventures.  Another key
financial issue is the availability of existing technology; it's there, but
the major question is how much it will cost.</P>

<P><a target="_top" href="/adb/03/05/">Politically</a>, the situation is
mixed.  From the government side, this is definitely the right thing to do
and the right time to do it.  On July 2, 1996, NASA Administrator Dan
Goldin commented, "I would like to see the commercial industry to start
acting like commercial industry, and not come back to Uncle Sugar every
time they need help."  But from the private industry side, we've
encountered a fear from aerospace contractors that the U.S. government,
their primary customer, will not want them to participate in the program.
Our major political challenge is to  resolve the incongruity of these two
opinions.</P>

<P><a target="_top" href="http://www.tlrc.com/">The Lunar Resources
Company</a> probably will not be in a hiring mode until the feasibility
study is complete.  Spacecraft development work for reference mission will
employ about 300 people over a period of 10 years; and most of that work
will be done by veteran aerospace contractors.</P>

<P>Several other companies are participating in the project.  When
employment opportunities arise, we will post a notice at:  <a target="_top"

<h2 align="center">What can I do to help?</H2>
<P><HR><P>

<P>There are thousands of things that need to be done to get this project
going, some part of which is bound to match your interests and talents.
You can participate by doing some research in areas as diverse as the
specifications for spacecraft parts and the marketing of toys.  You can
write or do artwork for <a target="_top" href="/mmm">PLEIADES</a> or <a
target="_top" href="http://www.tlrc.com/artemag/artemis-mag.html">ARTEMIS
magazine</a>.  You can develop software for engineering or business data
bases, dig through mounds of lunar data to help select the best <a
target="_top" href="/adb/04/01/01/03/">landing site</a>, or work through a
crew activities timeline.</P>

<P>One particular area where volunteers are especially welcome is doing
artwork of the spacecraft, lunar development, and the Artemis Project in
general.</P>

<P>See the Artemis Project world wide web site for the lists of <a
target="_top" href="/Things_You_Can_Do.html">things you can do</a>.  We
have a huge number of projects in our job jar already, and new ones will be
described on the web site and in PLEIADES as they come up.</P>
