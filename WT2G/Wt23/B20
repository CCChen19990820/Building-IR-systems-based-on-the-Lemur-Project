scope  has widened to cover developments since the thirteenth century and to include articles in French and 
German.  Contributions from Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, 
USA and Russia bear testimony to its international appeal.  Each issue includes a comprehensive book 
reviews section and essay reviews on a group of books on a broader level.  The editor is supported by an 
active international board.  The original index has been extended to cover the period 1970 to 1986, and is 
available from the publisher.  A unique feature of the journal is the reproduction of  selected illustrations in 
colour.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>READERSHIP</H3>
The journal is directed to all those interested in the evolution of science and technology and its impact on 
the development of related arts and industries.<BR>

<TITLE>Information for Authors</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Information for Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Aim of <I>Contemporary Physics</I></H4>
<I>Contemporary Physics</I> presents authoritative, lucid articles on important recent developments in 
physics that can be profitably read by all those who wish to keep abreast of the field, whether they be 
physicists, physical scientists, engineers, or biological scientists who are employed in higher education, 
teaching, industry and government.  <I>Contemporary Physics</I> is of particular use to undergraduates, 
teachers and lecturers, and those starting postgraduate studies.<P>
<P>
Readers should be able to understand the review without reference to other material, although authors 
should give references to those who wish to explore further.<P>
<P>
<H4>Readers</H4>
We assume that our readers are mainly physicists and that they have a grasp of the fundamentals of 
physics.  Some, however, may still be undergraduates; others may have completed their formal studies 
forty or so years ago.  Some are teachers with broad interests: others are highly specialized research 
workers, perhaps in industry.  Many readers will not have English as their first language, although authors 
may assume that they are reasonably competent in English.  We ask authors, therefore, to do two 
things:<P>
<P>
(1) To identify and explain the essential physics of the topic being discussed, with basic equations if 
appropriate.  Experts tend to assume that the readers know more than they do and that they can 
immediately recall this knowledge precisely.  Authors should supplement formal derivations by the type of 
explanation that imprints the results on the reader's mind.<P>
(2) To relate the topic to more familiar concepts of physics.  It is particularly helpful to put the subject in a 
broad context, either historical or in relation to other fields of physics, or to applications in industry.<P>
<P>
<H4>Style of writing</H4>
Please write as directly as possible, avoiding the passive voice and avoiding phrases such as 'it must be 
noted that... ' and 'from the foregoing it will be understood that... '. Vary the lengths of your sentences but 
keep them short rather than long.  Deal in physical pictures as much as possible and relate the text to your 
illustrations.  Use a consistent terminology and keep specialized words to a minimum.  Please use as few 
acronyms and abbreviations as possible and, unless they are very well known, spell acronyms out.  If you 
are the sole author, do not be afraid to use 'I' where this is appropriate.  If it is necessary to present a 
substantial mathematical argument or a derivation, please put it in an appendix if it interrupts the general 
flow of the exposition. Above all, try to convey something of the excitement that you feel about the subject 
and its importance to physics and to the wider world.<P>
<P>
Please add a few lines of biographical information at the end of your article: our readers would like to 
know how you became interested in the subject of your article.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations</H4>
Illustrations are as important as the text, and should be as simple, relevant and clear as possible.  A 
potential reader, after reading the title, often glances next at the figures, and their main purpose should be 
evident from the legend beneath the figure and the words used in labelling the parts of diagrams and the 
axes of graphs without reference to the text.<P>
Black-and-white photographs should have adequate contrast.  Colour illustrations can be printed if they are 
necessary to convey the scientific content of the illustration.<P>
Diagrams and graphs should be drawn in black ink on A4 paper.  A good sharp image is required.  The 
preferred widths are 120-170 mm for reduction to single column width, and 250-35O mm if the illustration 
is to go right across the page.<P>
Labelling of axes of graphs should be in words, whenever possible, and the dimensionless numbers on the 
axes should be those obtained by dividing the quantities measured by the units employed.  For example, 
the numbers relating to density should be labelled Density/(kg  M-3)  , and numbers relating to temperature 
in degrees celsius should be labelled temperaturePC.<P>
Please use different line thicknesses for emphasis; for example, thinner lines for axes of graphs and thicker 
lines for curves.  Use different data points and lines, dashed or dotted, when more than one curve appears 
in a graph, and identify their meaning in the legend or by labelling, legends should explain any 
abbreviations used in the figures.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
References may be cited using either an author/date format, listed at the end of the paper in alphabetical 
order, or numbered consecutively in the text (e.g. cited [31, [4-8]) and listed at the end of the paper in the 
order in which they appear in the text.  The latter system is preferred for papers containing a large number 
of references, as it causes less disruption to the flow of the text.<P>
<P>
<H4>Length</H4>
Articles can vary greatly in length.  Please discuss the appropriate length with the Editor before you begin 
writing.<P>
<P>
<H4>Refereeing and acceptance</H4>
All manuscripts are read by the Editor and usually two members of the Editorial Board.  If we ask for 
changes, these are to make the paper as interesting and comprehensible as possible to the wide readership 
of Contemporary Physics.<P>
<P>
<H4>Copyright</H4>
Authors are responsible for obtaining permission for the use of copyright material, especially when using 
figures from other published sources.  Copyright in articles published in Contemporary Physics is normally 
transferred to the publishers although authors may retain it if they wish.  Authors receive a transfer form 
with their proofs.<P>
<P>
<H4>Proofs and offprints</H4>
Proofs will be submitted to the author for the correction of printer's errors.  Principal or corresponding 
authors will receive 100 offprints without charge and additional offprints may be ordered.  An order form 
will accompany the proofs.<P>
<P>
<H4>Biographical details</H4>
Each author should provide a short biography, and this should include details of affiliation, research 
activities and how the author(s) became interested in the subject being reviewed.<P>

<h3>SCOPE</h3>
<p><i>Journal of Experimental &amp; Theoretical Artificial Intelligence</i> (JETAI) is advancing scientific 
research in artificial intelligence (AI) by providing a public forum for the presentation, evaluation 
and criticism of research results, the discussion of methodological issues, and the communication of 
positions, preliminary findings and research directions. JETAI features work in all subfields of AI 
research that adopts a scientific rather than engineering methodology, focusing on work in cognitive

<p align=center><font size=4>Two Special Issues of the Journal of Experimental &amp;Theoretical<br>
Artificial Intelligence</font></p>
<h1 align=center>Software Architectures for Hardware 
Agents</h1>
<p align=center>Henry Hexmoor, David Kortenkamp, Ian K Horswill</p>
<p>This collection explores the architectural issues involved in designing intelligent agents that interact 
with unstructured, physical worlds. Ten years of renewed interest in mobile robotics research have 
led to the accumulation of a great deal of experience and a general consensus on core issues and 
approaches. The requirements imposed by the physical world are pervasive and affect all aspects 
of system design, thus these papers will interest researchers from a wide range of AI backgrounds, 
including KR, planning, learning vision, and communication, as well as cognitive scientists and 
biologists. </p>
<p>These two special issues will appear Volume 9 numbers 2 and 3 (1997).</p>

<p>SCOPE<br>
Modern systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated in their demand for 
performance, reliability and increasing authonomy. Historically, highly analytic and numeric based 
methods have sufficed, frequently simplifying the problem to allow analytical tractability. Many 
manufactured and natural systems (biological, ecological and socio-economic) cannot be 
adequately represented quantitively alone; qualitations and heuristics, linguistics etc, knowledge is 
frequently required within a common information-processing framework. A wide range of new 
theories, methodologies and techniques is required to &#145;enable&#146; such systems, and thus engineering 
and integration to deal with these demands. The primary aim of IJSS is to become world leader in 
the exciting and demanding field of intelligent systems engineering and its applications.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>READERSHIP</h3>
<p>The journal is aimed at advanced research workers, and development engineers, intelligent and 
manufacturing engineers in industry and universities who have an interest in the application of 
modelling, simulation, optimization and control to specific systems.<br>

submitted to:</H4>
Editor, <I>Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence</I>, at either of the editorial 
addresses shown on the inside front cover.  All papers will be refereed by at least two external reviewers, 
as well as by one of the editors.  The editors seek to maintain a three month turnaround time between 
submission and a publication decision.<P>
<P>
<H4>2. All papers must be in English.</H4>
The entire manuscript should be letter quality printed or typed on one side only of plain paper, either A4 or 
8.5 X 11 inch, with double spacing used throughout.. The first page of the manuscript should carry the title, 
the names, institutional addresses, institutional telephone numbers, and electronic mail addresses of the 
authors, and a short title of no more than 50 characters (including spaces) to be used as a running head.  
The second page of the manuscript should carry an abstract of about 200 words.  The remainder of the text 
should not exceed 30 double spaced pages, including references but excluding figures and tables.<P>
<P>
<H4>3. All displayed items except equations and quotations 
should be treated as figures</H4>
(including tables and samples of code, as well as traditional figures).  An original set of professional 
quality figures on separate pages should accompany the manuscript.  Line drawings may be India ink 
originals or glossy prints.  Halftone illustrations must be submitted as glossy prints.  Bear in mind that 
figures will typically require reduction.  Illustrations cannot be printed in colour.  All figures must be 
referred to by number in the text.<P>
<P>
<H4>4. The text should be written in third person to facilitate blind 
reviewing.</H4>
Use of personal pronouns should be avoided, and male nouns and pronouns should not be used to refer to 
persons of both sexes.  The names of the authors or their institutions should appear only on the title 
page.<P>
<P>
<H4>5. The name-date style should be used for all 
references</H4>
, e.g.<P>
Ernst, A., and Newell, A. (1969) GPS: A Case Study in Generality and Problem Solving (New York: 
Academic).<P>
Poggio, T. Torre, V., and Koch, C. (1985) Computational vision and regularization theory. Nature, 
317:314-319.<P>
Woods, D. D. (1986) Paradigms for intelligent decision support.  In E. Hollnagel, G. Mancini, and D. 
Woods (eds.) Intelligent Decision Support in Process Control (Heidelberg: Springer), 153-174.<P>
<P>
All authors' names should be included in the reference list, 'et al.' should be used to indicate more than two 
authors in citations in the text, e.g. Poggio et al. (1985). Journal names should not be abbreviated.  
Inclusive page numbers must be given for all references to articles in journals, proceedings volumes, or 
books.  With the exception of theses or dissertations, unpublished works should not be included as 
references.<P>
<P>
<H4>6. Footnotes may not be used.</H4>
Endnotes may be used if necessary; they should be collected on separate sheets at the end of the text.<P>
<P>
<H4>7. Proofs</H4>
must be returned to the publisher within three days of receipt.  Any change to the text other than the 
correction of typographic errors will be charged to the author.<P>
<P>
<H4>8. Fifty free offprints</H4>
will be provided to the first author of each paper.  Authors may order one copy of JETAI in which their 
contribution appears at a special discount rate: an order form will accompany proofs.  There will be no 
page charges.<P>
<P>
<H4>9. Articles are accepted on condition</H4>
that they have not been previously published; that they are not under consideration elsewhere; and that 
authors own the copyright, and have obtained all necessary permissions for the reproduction of text or 
illustrations.  Articles are accepted for publication in good faith.  In the event that authors seek to withdraw 
articles from the press once an article has been accepted, Taylor &amp  Francis shall require the author to 
reimburse them in full for all costs incurred.  Copyright is normally transferred to the publisher.  Authors 
wishing to retain copyright must submit a licence giving the publisher exclusive once-only world rights to 
publish the article in JETAI. Copyright transfer forms will accompany proofs.<P>

The <I>International Journal of Production Research</I> (IJPR) is a well-established and highly 
successful journal reporting production and manufacturing research. IJPR is published monthly and 
includes papers on manufacturing technology and the fundamental behaviour of production resources, and 
also the complex and cross-disciplinary problems of analysis and control that arise in combining these 
resources within the design of production systems. Manufacturing strategy, policy formulation and 
evaluation, and the contribution of technological innovation are major concerns of the journal. Techniques 
developed in computer and mathematical sciences used in the design, measurement or operation of 
production systems are also considered.<BR>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
The <I>International Journal of Lifelong Education</I> provides an international forum for the debate of 
the principles and practice of lifelong, continuing, recurrent  adult and initial education and learning. A 
common but not exclusive theme is the social purpose of lifelong education. Discussions in the journal 
have shown that those concerned with the education of adults and children must face the issue of the 
relationship of that activity to the society in which they seek to promote it: the journal provides the context 
for an informed debate on the theory and practice of lifelong education in a variety of countries. All papers 
are peer-reviewed. Each issue carries a lively reviews section.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>READERSHIP</H3>
Practitioners and researchers in adult, continuing, lifelong, distance and non-formal education.<BR>

Redesigned in 1993, the <I>Journal of Garden History</I> addresses itself to readers with a serious 
interest in the subject, and is now established as the main place in which to publish scholarly work on 
garden history. While the journals main emphasis is on documentation of individual gardens in all parts 
of the world, articles on other topics - iconography, aesthetics, botany and horticulture, technology, 
social and economic history, conservation and restoration of historic gardens, geography, history of ideas 
- are welcomed.  From time to time issues are centred around themes, for example, the Anglo-Dutch 
garden in the age of William and Mary, eighteenth-century gardens of the Chesapeake, and gardens of the 
Ancient Mediterranean, and rediscovering the British garden.  The Journal is renowned for the quality of 
its book reviews.<BR>

If inclusive education is good for all students, then all educators and educational policy-makers ought to 
enter into a continuing dialogue and debate about the form and nature of these schools, universities and 
technical colleges. This journal will provide a strategic forum for this international, multi-disciplinary 
dialogue.<P>
Papers published in the <I>I J Inclusive Education</I> will be original, refereed, multi-disciplinary 
research into pedagogies,  curricula, organisational structures, policy-making, administration and cultures 
to include all students in education.<P>
The journal extends beyond enrolment to successful participation which generates greater options for all 
people in education and beyond.<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4>Audience</H4>
The journal will be essential reading for those working in the following areas:<P>
<P>
-  intra-cultural studies<P>
-  special needs<P>
-  racism<P>
-  behaviour &amp  discipline <P>
-  bilingualism<P>
-  gender and sexuality<P>
-  educational psychology<P>
-  socio-economic disadvantage<P>
-  policy and administration/supervision in the early childhood, primary/elementary, secondary, 
further/higher/tertiary, and vocational educational sectors.<P>
<P>
<H4>The International Journal of Inclusive Education will:</H4>
-  provide an international forum for the publication of research and debate of conceptual and 
methodological issues concerned with 'inclusive education' across all school, higher education, technical, 
and  further education settings;   <P>
<P>
-  provide an international medium bringing together  multi-disciplinary reviews of the interactions of 
pedagogies, educational policy-making and administration, curricula and school organisational culture with 
race, ethnicity, class, gender, disability and sexuality;  <P>
<P>
-  provide a multi-disciplinary forum for reporting and evaluating innovative inclusive educational 
practices and research across  a range of educational settings which promote equity and social justice for 
groups and individuals at risk of marginalisation in education on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, class, 
disability and or sexuality.<P>

<LI>homelessness
<LI>recurring and haunting memories
<LI>losses that disenfranchise and stigmatize
<LI>losses resulting from war and violence
<LI>aging
</UL>
<BR>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
<I>Issues in Mental Health Nursing</I> is a refereed journal designed to expand the literature on the 
psychosocial and mental health aspects of nursing care currently available to students, educators, and 
practitioners. It deals with new, innovative approaches to client care, analysis of current issues, and nursing 
research findings. Because clinical research is the primary vehicle for the development of nursing science, 
the journal presents articles that report research and lists studies conducted by nurses that focus on the 
caretaking process. The journal also presents articles that address the application of the nursing process to 
clients and families for the purpose of mental health promotion, prevention of psychosocial dysfunction, 
and the resolution or amelioration of existing problems.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>CLINICAL LINGUISTICS &amp  
PHONETICS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Notes for Contributors</H4>
<I>Clinical Linguistics &amp  Phonetics</I> is concerned with the interaction between the study of 
speech and language on the one hand, and disorders of speech and language on the other.  Submission of 
practical, 'tutorial' reviews, and of more theoretical discussions are welcomed, either applying 
linguistic/phonetic analytic techniques to clinical problems, or showing how clinical data contribute to 
theoretical issues in linguistics/phonetics. Work is particularly encouraged in the less-developed areas of 
clinical linguistics such as clinical dialectology/sociolinguistics, childhood dysphasia and dyspraxia, and 
disordered communication in bilingual and multicultural settings.  Papers on language development, and 
other pscho- or neurolinguistic areas will be included, where they shed light on normative linguistic 
behaviour against which to judge the non-normal.  Work in progress, readers' responses and review articles 
will also be published.<P>
<P>
<H4>Format of submissions</H4>
(1) Manuscripts should be in English, typed on one side of the paper and double-spaced.  Four copies of 
the text, tables and any artwork or photographs should be submitted, with the originals of any artwork or 
photographs.  The submission should include a separate title page bearing the name(s) and affiliation(s) of 
the  contributing author(s), an abstract of no more than 200 words typed on a separate page, and the name 
and address for offprint requests at the end of the submission.  A running title should be provided, together 
with 3 to 5 keywords/phrases for indexing and abstracting purposes.<P>
<P>
(2) Figures should be drawn in black ink on white card.  Lettering should be of a high standard and of such 
a size that it remains legible when reduced to a width of 1 1 0mm.  All artwork and photographs should be 
marked in pencil on the back with the name(s) of the author(s) and the figure number.  Authors should 
indicate where in the text any figures should occur.  Written permission to reproduce any materials held in 
copyright by others should be included with the submission.<P>
<P>
(3) Referencing within the text should be given thus: 'This work is described in full in Grunwell (1982)'.  
The  first mention in the text of a reference involving more than two authors should be in full (For 
example, Crystal, Fletcher and Garman, 1976); subsequent mentions should be abbreviated to Crystal et al.  
All cited references should be listed alphabetically at the end of the article using the following styles:<P>

Disability (London: Edward Arnold).<P>

word sequences (Paper presented at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Convention, Atlanta, 
Georgia).<P>
<P>
(4) Footnotes should be collected together, and typed on a separate page at the end of the article.<P>
<P>
(5) Phonetic symbols should be those of the International Phonetic Association, as most recently revised 
(1989).  Care should he taken when marking symbols by hand.  Attention should be paid to the correct use 
of bracketing around symbols.  Phonetic symbols should not be used in footnotes.  When transcribing 
disordered speech, it is recommended that contributors employ the symbols in the Extensions to the IPA.  
Copies of these symbols are available from the Editor.  If other systems are used to represent disordered 
speech, these should be fully explained and referenced.  No guidelines are given as to transcribing 
intonation, but again the system used should be explained and referenced.<P>
<P>
(6) Authors may request blind refereeing, and should therefore prepare manuscripts in such a way that no 
clues remain as to the identity of the author(s) following removal of the title page, although the title should 
be repeated above the abstract<P>
<P>
(7) Proofs are sent to the corresponding author who must return them within three days of receipt.  Printers 
errors may be corrected, but any changes from the original manuscript will be charged to the author.<P>
<P>
There are no page charges in <I>Clinical Linguistics &amp  Phonetics</I> and 50 free offprints will be 
sent to the principal author, on publication.  Additional offprints can be ordered from the publisher an order 
form accompanies authors' proofs.<P>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
Twenty years ago most maritime management decisions were taken on the basis of experience and hunch. 
Today, that experience is augmented by expert analysis and informed by research findings.  <I>Maritime 
Policy &amp  Management</I> provides the latest findings and analyses, and the opportunity for 
exchanging views through its Comment Section.  A multi-disciplinary and international refereed journal, it 
brings together papers on the many different topics that concern the maritime world.  Emphasis is placed 
on business, organizational, economic, sociolegal and management topics at port, community, shipping 
company and shipboard levels. The Journal also provides notices of conferences, book reviews and short 
items of interest to research workers and professionals, ashore and afloat, including an update on current 
legal issues.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>READERSHIP</H3>
<I>Maritime Policy &amp  Management</I> is aimed at interested policymakers and managers 
throughout the fields of shipping and ports. It is read by those practising the business of shipping in all its 
aspects, academics, government officials, and journalists around the world, and is intended to have both a 
theoretical and practical appeal.<BR>

The <I>International Journal of Pest Management</I> publishes original research papers concerning the 
control of pests and diseases of plants of economic, conservation, medicinal and amenity value within the 
areas of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, conservation, and stored products research. The geographical 
scope of the journal is worldwide.The journal covers the following topics: control of pests (invertebrates, 
vertebrates, weeds) and diseases of plants and their products; biological and cultural control and integrated 
pest management; plant resistance to pest attack, including genetic aspects; epidemiology and population 
dynamics of pests and diseases in relation to control strategies; assessment of pest and disease damage 
(damage and economic thresholds); theoretical and systems models as applied to practical pest 
management; the relationship of pest management to the wider aspects of farming systems and rural 
development; and pest management systems. The journal also publishes reviews, normally by invitation, 
and taxonomic keys for the identification of pests and control agents of major economic importance. The 
journals Forum section aims to facilitate discussion and debate between readers and authors on important 
issues in pest management.<BR>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
<I>Geomicrobiology Journal</I> is a unified vehicle for research and review articles in the rapidly 
growing field of geomicrobiology. Articles deal with microbial transformations of materials composing 
the earths crust, including oceans, seas, lakes, bottom sediments, soils, mineral deposits, and rocks, and 
the geological impact these transformations have at present or have had over geologic time. In this 
context, the functions of bacteria, yeasts, fungi, microalgae, protozoans and related microorganisms as 
geomechanical or geochemical agents are examined. Articles may stress the nature of specific 
microorganisms and their activity in a geomicrobial context, or the geological consequences of 
geomicrobial activity. The journal covers basic topics such as microbial weathering of rocks, microbial 
roles in formation and degradation of specific minerals, mineralization of organic matter, biogeochemical 
cycling of elements, isotopic fractionation and paleomicrobiology, and applied topics such as fossil fuel 
microbiology, the microbiology involved in bioleaching of ores, geomicrobiological prospecting, and 
ground water microbiology.<BR>

<H4>SCOPE</H4>
The <I>Journal of Health Communication</I>  is a scholarly, peer-reviewed quarterly. It presents the 
latest developments in the field of health communication including research in social marketing, shared 
decision-making, communication (from interpersonal to mass media), psychology, government, and 
health education in the United States and the world. The journal publishes qualitative and quantitative 
studies, ethical essays, case studies and book reviews. <BR>
The journal seeks to advance a synergistic relationship between research and practical information to help 
readers build a New Health Order. The <I>Journal of Health Communication</I> focuses on promoting 
the vital life of the individual and the good health of the worlds people with presentations of research, 
progress in areas of technology and public health, ethics, politics/policy, and the application of health 
communication principles to the better health of individuals and communities. <BR>
Effective communication is critical at all levels of society. Of particular importance to the health 
professions are intercultural and international variables and barriers, as well as applications to health 
marketing campaigns, the uses of new technologies, public health campaigns, health advocacy, ethical 
issues, and the like. The <I>Journal of Health Communication</I> encompasses all of these areas and 
more. <BR>

<h3>SCOPE</h3>
<p>From the first issue of 1997, TEN will be retitled Toxicology &amp; Ecotoxicology News/Reviews. 
This change reflects the increasing importance to readers and contributors of the reviews section 
within this premier journal. The change also coincides with the appointment of a well-known and 
distinguished co-editor from the U.S., Dr Judith Zelikoff of the New York University Medical 
Center. </p>
<p>This innovative journal is a highly readable publication comprising reviews of the highest scientific 
quality on areas of current interest in toxicology, environmental toxicology, and ecotoxicology. It 
differs from currently available toxicology journals in that it provides information in a format that will 
appeal across all disciplines and levels, and which will meet the scientific needs of academic, 
regulatory, and commercial toxicologists and health and safety advisers worldwide. Under the 
guidance of a distinguished board of expert editors, TEN provides authoritative updates on the 
latest developments and concerns in toxicology and ecotoxicology.<br>

<h2 align=center>&quot;TEN out of Ten&quot; says <em>Nature</em> review 21/9/95</h2>
<p>&quot;Now here is a nice little journal. Taylor &amp; Francis have decided to publish a popular reviews and 
opinion journal on toxicology, in all its aspects... The journal contains leading articles, subject 
reviews, legislative matters, general news in the field, book reviews and news of meetings. The 
reviews are the real meat and provide good background reading in a variety of areas. Areas 
covered (taken at random) include bacterial endotoxins; modelling of biological toxicity through 
structure-activity relationships, immune reactions of agrochemicals; and the metabolism of 
chemicals by skin. The level of these review articles is such that they are of benefit to active 
researchers while providing good background material for, say, undergraduate projects. The 
material covered in the reviews, opinion pieces and open discussion sections, intelligently explore 
the wide range of toxicology.</p>
<p>Well put together and worth the asking price... it will be even better value when the publication 
goes bimonthly at the end of the year. The journal should be prescribed reading for everybody 
involved in the broad area of toxicology and adverse reactions... [and] should be on the shelf of 
most university libraries.&quot;<br>

with respect to chemicals. </li>
<li>Biomarkers of effect: including measures of endogenous substances or parameters indicative 
of biological change such as alteration in enzymes in tissues or body fluids. </li>
<li>All three types of markers may be either in vivo or in vitro and will apply to any biological 
system, not just human or mammalian. </li>
</ul>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
Culture, ethnicity and gender influence multicultural organizations, mass media portrayals, interpersonal 
interaction, development campaigns, and rhetoric. Dealing with these issues, <I>The</I> <I>Howard 
Journal of Communications</I>, is a quarterly that examines ethnicity, gender, and culture as domestic 
and international communication concerns.<BR>
<BR>
No other scholarly journal focuses exclusively on cultural issues in communication research. Moreover, 
few communication journals employ such a wide variety of methodologies. Since issues of 
multiculturalism, multiethnicity and gender often call forth messages from persons who otherwise would 
be silenced, traditional methods of inquiry are supplemented by post-positivist inquiry to give voice to 
those who otherwise might not be heard.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>READERSHIP</H3>
Professionals and researchers in allied health; womens studies political science; ethnic studies; sociology 
and communications; nurses; and media historians.<BR>

The journal (under its former title <I>Optica Acta</I>) was founded in 1953 - some years before the 
advent of the laser - as an international journal of optics.  Since then optical research has changed greatly; 
fresh areas of enquiry have been explored, different techniques have been employed and the range of 
application has greatly increased.  The journal has continued to reflect these advances as part of  its steadily 
widening scope, which encompasses classical and quantum optics including lasers, diffractive optics, 
holographs, nonlinear optics and photon statistics.  There are also special issues on highlighted areas.<BR>

concerned with transport in many nations.  They should be written for readers not expert in the author's 
discipline.  All reviews are refereed.<P>
<P>
2. Articles will be invited by the Editors or may be offered unsolicited by authors. In the latter case the 
author may find it useful to write first to an editor in his country or to the Editor-in-Chief outlining in not 
more than 200 words the content, purpose and context of the article.<P>
<P>
3. When a full article is submitted, three copies in English should be provided as follows, double spaced on 
one side of the paper only.<P>
(a) Title page with abstract (up to 250 words), names and affiliations of all authors, name and address for 
correspondence.<P>
(b) Main text with sections and subsections numbered and an estimate of length (see 4 below).<P>
(c) Acknowledgements.<P>
(d) Appendices.<P>
(e) References, normally cited by the name and date system and listed alphabetically by the author. <P>
Example (book):<P>
BANISTER, D., 1980, Transport Mobility and Deprivation in Inter Urban Areas (London: Saxon 
House).<P>
Example (journal):<P>
HUTCHINSON, B. G., 198 1, Urban transport policy and policy analysis methods.  Transport Reviews, 1, 
169.<P>
<P>
(f) Biographical note(s) on the author(s) (about 100 words) for publication.<P>
(g) Tables numbered in sequence, each on a separate sheet with explanatory captions as necessary.<P>
(h) Illustrations (maps, diagrams, photographs), numbered in sequence, in black and white, showing only 
essential features, and ready for reproduction allowing for reduction.  Scales should be indicated by scale-
bars, lettering clear, and geographical names up to date and in English spelling.<P>
(i) Captions to illustrations grouped on one sheet.<P>
<P>
4. The preferred length of an article, including all the supporting information listed above, is about 20 
pages of the TR size.  Authors can assume approximately 550 words to a page of text and allow for figures 
and tables in accordance with the lay-out in past issues of TR.<P>
<P>
5. The principal or corresponding author will be sent proofs for checking and will receive free of charge 50 
offprints and the issue of the journal in which the article appears.  Additional offprints may be ordered on a 
form which accompanies the proofs.<P>
<P>
6. Authors from Australasia, Latin America and the U.S.A. should approach the appropriate Area Editor as 
indicated in the Editorial Board listing.  Authors from the rest of the world should submit direct to The 
Editor, Transport Reviews, Bramshaw Road, Lower Farm Road, Effingham, Surrey KT24 5JJ, U.K.<P>
<P>
The Editors do not hold themselves responsible for the views expressed by Authors.<P>

<BR>
<H3>SCOPE</H3>
The aim of <I>Studies in Conflict and Terrorism</I> is to cast light on all of these conflicts, including  
their motivations and  forms, in different parts of the world. Many of the conflicts of the 1990s will involve 
ethnic or religious differences, others will be based on social or historical issues, and still others involve 
plain criminal acts.  Ethnic and religious conflicts in particular are likely to increase in number. The journal 
publishes the best theoretical and empirical studies that  contribute both to a better understanding of the 
causes of conflicts as well as to the strategies and tactics of the groups conducting them. The goal is that 
this understanding will help policymakers to deal with them more effectively to promote peaceful, orderly 
socio-economic improvements and world peace.<BR>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
Psychology and related disciplines throughout the human sciences and humanities have been 
revolutionized by a "postmodern" emphasis on the role of language, human systems, and personal 
knowledge in the construction of social realities. The <I>Journal of Constructivist Psychology</I> is the 
first publication to provide a professional forum for this emerging focus, embracing such diverse 
expressions of constructivism as personal construct theory, structural-developmental and language-based 
approaches to psychology, constructivist family therapy, and narrative psychology.  Each issue of the 
journal features departments highlighting theoretical, empirical, and methodological developments in 
constructivist and social constructionist scholarship, as well as contributions to professional practice.<BR>
<BR>
<H3>READERSHIP</H3>
Essential reading for counselors and psychotherapists of many theoretical orientations looking for novel 
contributions to their practice, as well as for scholars in a range of disciplines concerned with the 
ramifications of postmodern thought for the study of individuals and social systems.<BR>

<H3>SCOPE</H3>
The <I>International Journal of Radiation Biology</I> publishes original papers, reviews, current topic 
articles, technical notes/reports, and meeting reports on the effects of ionizing, UV and visible radiation, 
accelerated particles, microwaves, ultrasound, heat and related modalities.  The focus is on the biological 
effects of such radiations: from radiation chemistry to the spectrum of responses of living organisms and 
underlying mechanisms, including genetic abnormalities, repair phenomena, cell death, dose modifying 
agents and tissue responses. Application of basic studies to medical uses of radiation extends the coverage 
to practical problems such as physical and chemical adjuvants which improve the effectiveness of radiation 
in cancer therapy.  Assessment of the hazards of low doses of radiation is also considered.<BR>

The World List of Schools of Pharmacy, which has been compiled since 1986 on behalf of the Academic 
Section of the International Pharmacy Federation (FIP) by Dr David Temple, is now available on the 
Internet to World Wide Web users.<P>
<P>
<A NAME = foundat></A>It can be found at <P>

It is to be hoped that the launch of a version of the list on the World Wide Web will allow greater access to 
this data and facilitate a continual update of information to be provided to the editor.  Users of the service 
are asked to contact Dr Temple direct with any corrections, omissions or other suggestions to improve the

INFORMATION</H4></CENTER>
<P>
Addresses of Schools of Pharmacy World-Wide have been collected since 1984 by Dr David Temple, then 
the General Secretary of the Academic Section of the International Pharmacy Federation (FIP).    A 
preliminary print-based edition of the World List of Schools of Pharmacy was produced for Academic 
Section members in July 1986 in time for the 46th International Congress of FIP, which was held in 
Helsinki in September of that year.   As a result of interest shown in the list and a considerable amount of 
revised information generated, a first definitive edition was produced in time for the International Congress 
of FIP in Amsterdam the following year.   Further editions were produced in 1989 (reprinted in 1990) and 
1993.   <P>
<P>
A new print-based 4th edition has been published by FIP in July 1995 and is available from them by 
writing to the address: International Pharmaceutical Federation, Andries Bickerweg 5, 2517 JP The Hague, 
The Netherlands.   The International Pharmacy Student's Federation (IPSF) have collaborated with FIP in 
providing new information on their members schools.<P>
<P>
Previously in 1966, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had published a "World Directory of Schools 
of Pharmacy, 1963", which described the salient features of pharmaceutical education in 81 countries and 
included names and addresses of Schools in each country at that time.   This was part of a series of 
directories covering all major health care disciplines.  The indication was given in the preface that this 
directory would be periodically updated.   However, no subsequent editions have appeared.   <P>

<P>
As schools start to realise the value of the Internet and set up their own WWW servers, I intend to link their 
entry in my list direct to their own HomePage.  If you check out Sydney in Australia, you will see what I 
mean.   Several Schools in Austria, Germany, Denmark, the U.K. and U.S. are also linked.   All I will need 
is your School's URL address.<P>
<P>
If your school is not contemplating its own HomePage in the immediate future, then I can offer an 
alternative solution.   If you check out Laval University in Quebec, Canada, you will see a link in their 
entry to a separate page on our server here in Cardiff, with details of many of their staff members with their 
individual e-mail address.   In this case, what I would need from you is the list you want mounted in 
electronic form, i.e. as an e-mail message.<P>

<H4><A NAME = GAH></A>UNIQUE HISTORICAL 
ARCHIVE SHOWCASED IN T&amp F JOURNAL</H4>
We are pleased to announce that our <I>Journal of Garden History</I>,  now in its sixteenth year,  has 
published as a special issue (volume 16,  number 1,  1996) the Bartram Historic Garden plant Catalogue, 
the first plant catalogue printed in America. The Catalogue is enriched with historical information about the 
Bartrams and their garden, and when issued in 1783 had the most complete list of North American plants to 
date.   The garden was always a collection of 'curious' plants arranged for utility or environmental 
considerations rather than display, and as such the Catalogue will facilitate the garden's preservation and 
restoration whilst increasing public awareness of many  species.<BR>
<BR>
The Catalogue will become a standard reference for those interested in historic gardens of the 18th 
century.<BR>
<BR>
The Catalogue is prefaced by essays from Martha Leigh Wolf,  Director,  and Joel T Fry,  Curator,  of the 
John Bartram Association of Philadelphia,  Penn.,  USA.<BR>
<BR>
The <I>Journal of Garden History</I> is published quarterly,  and is  edited by Professor John Dixon 
Hunt of the University of Pennsylvania.<BR>

<TITLE>NEW EVIDENCE IN POWER CABLE CANCER LINK</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>NEW EVIDENCE IN POWER CABLE CANCER 
LINK</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<H4>New research, published in <I>The International Journal of 
Radiation Biology</I> (14/2/96), may help explain the increased 
incidence of cancer associated with electromagnetic fields from 
electric wiring and overhead power cables.  The research, funded 
by the Medical Research Council at the University of Bristol,  was 
featured in a Channel 4 Dispatches  programme.</H4>
<BR>
The Bristol researchers have found that the mains leads of ordinary domestic electrical appliances can 
attract radioactive particles formed from the decay of radon - the naturally occuring radioactive gas found 
in everyday room air.  Further experiments suggest that similar concentrations of these radon decay 
products, and other pollutants, may be present around overhead power lines.  Radon and its decay products 
(which are also radioactive) have been  linked with cancer.  <BR>
<BR>
Radon decay products attach themselves to minute particles of water and gas in the air, known as aerosols.  
The researchers used special plastic films to detect these radioactive particles.  Their experiments showed 
that the aerosols were attracted to mains power cables like iron filings to a magnet.  Electric fields also 
make the aerosols oscillate in the air at the same frequency as the mains supply (50 times a second).  This 
movement increases their chance of sticking to the skin or being inhaled by people in the vicinity.  As well 
as being radioactive, the aerosols could contain bacteria, pollutants or other chemicals in the air.<BR>
<BR>
The findings were repeated in a variety of domestic situations, and simulations of the electromagnetic 
fields from overhead power lines showed clear evidence of the build-up of radioactivity in the air around 
the source.<BR>
<BR>
The problem of exactly how the changes in movement of the decay products and aerosols might affect the 
body's internal organs is still unresolved.  But the scientists suggest that these effects may cause more 
particles to be inhaled. This, combined with the possible action of weak electric fields in the body, would 
increase the number of particles sticking to the mouth, throat and lungs.  The radon decay products could 
then be absorbed into the blood, travel around the body, and deliver an increased radiation dose to sensitive 
tissues such as the bone marrow and the foetus.<BR>
<BR>
However, the scientists stress that domestic electrical equipment is unlikely to cause health problems as the 
effects occur only very close to the power leads.  They say that the main effects will be around major 
sources of electromagnetic fields, such as overhead power lines, and that this is now an important area for 
futher investigation.<BR>
<BR>
"We have crossed a major conceptual barrier," said Professor Denis Henshaw, leader of the research team.  
"Previously, science could not explain how electromagnetic fields could cause cancer.  Now we have used 
principles from basic physics to show how these fields can concentrate a cocktail of known carcinogens 
around them.  And the good news is that it is relatively easy to shield against electric fields and possible to 
reduce radon levels in the home."<BR>

service</H3></CENTER>
The Taylor & Francis listservers provide an automated facility whereby Tables of Contents of journal 
issues can be received at regular intervals PRIOR TO THEIR PRINT PUBLICATION. Each issue is 
unique and contains only those tables of contents that have been compiled since the previous issue. Each 
listserver represents individual Taylor &amp  Francis and Psychology Press journals or groups of journals 
belonging to a specific subject area. Tables of Contents are automatically received via e-mail by members 
of lists as and when the contents become available.<BR>

This book provides a variety of answers in its description and discussion of new, sometimes radical 
approaches, to "usability evaluation" now an increasingly common business tool. This book contains new 
thinking on the subject of usability evaluation in industry.  Contributions come from those involved in the 
practice of industry based usability evaluation, as well as those involved in related research activities.  The 
chapters in the book are derived and developed from presentations and discussions at the invited 
international seminar Usability Evaluation in Industry.  The book gives a leading edge overview of current 
usability practice in industry - identifying issues of concern and approaches to tackling these.<BR>

<H5>Taylor &amp;  Francis &amp;  the Development of Science 
Publishing</H5>
<H5>W H Brock and A J Matthews</H5>
<H5>ISBN 0-85066-253-2</H5>
<P>
The story of the development of Taylor &amp;  Francis in this book is much more than  an isolated account 
of one small company  - it throws light on the whole process of scientific communications during the last 
200 years.<P>
"A history of Taylor &amp;  Francis is a history in a microcosm of a very important aspect of science, how 
scientists make known to each other and to the wider public what they are doing and what results they 
achieve.  Partly this is done through societies and academies, partly through independent firms. Both are 
needed, and I hope this book will help many readers to understand why this is so and to plan the future." 
Sir Nevill Mott, Taylor &amp;  Francis<P>

<TITLE>Notes for Contributors</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Notes for Contributors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<I>Philosophical Magazine Letters</I> publishes short contributions describing original research in the 
general field of condensed matter physics, i.e. the area covered by <I>Part A</I> (<B>Structure, Defects 
and Mechanical Properties</B>) and <I>Part B</I> (<B>Statistical Mechanics, Electronic, Optical 
and Magnetic Properties</B>) of <I>Philosophical Magazine</I>.  Work should be of sufficient merit 
and interest to warrant rapid publication.  Letters on new and emerging topics are particularly 
welcome.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Manuscripts</H4>
Submissions must report original research not previously published or being considered elsewhere. 
manuscripts should be no longer than about six printed pages and the number of figures should not exceed 
three.  Three copies of the manuscript are required, each with a complete set of line drawings and/or 
photographs.  Manuscripts should be printed in double spacing, preferably on A4 (21Omm x 297mm) or 
on 8 1/2 in x 11 in plain paper.  Adequate spacing is particularly important in the abstract, references, 
displayed equations and tables.  Tables, references and figure captions should be prepared on separate 
sheets.  Section headings should be concise, prominent and numbered sequentially.<P>
<P>
Punctuation should be carried through to displayed equations, where normal sentence construction applies.  
Hyphenation should be used to achieve accuracy and clarity.  The Concise Oxford Dictionary is adopted as 
a standard for spellings.  All abbreviations should be spelt out on their first appearance.  References should 
be cited in the text using the author/date format: (Anderson 1964); (Mott and Davis 1979); first citation 
(Anderson, Halperin and Varma 1972); thereafter (Anderson et al. 1972).  They should be listed at the end 
in alphabetical order.  Significant equations should be displayed centrally and numbered on the right.  
Symbols, units and their display should conform to the recommendations of the Royal Society publication  
Quantities, Units and Symbols.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Figures</H4>
Figures should be prepared to the highest standard.  Line figures and photographs for half-tone 
reproduction must be complete with all lettering and labels.  Photographs for half-tone reproduction should 
be on glossy paper.  In preparing artwork, attention should be paid to the thickness and height of lettering 
to allow for reduction to appropriate size.  All figures must be clearly identified.<P>
<P>
<H4>Electronic Submission</H4>
Instructions for electronic submission of manuscripts can be obtained from the Editors (addresses below) 
or by email from "eadl@leicester.ac.uk".<P>
<P>
<H4>Publication</H4>
Letters are normally published within 10-14 weeks of acceptance.  To ensure rapid publication, general 
processing and refereeing will be accelerated and extensive revision following a referee's report will not 
normally be permitted.  Authors will receive proofs, but must communicate corrections within seven days 
of their outward despatch.  If return of proofs is delayed, they will be seen by the Editors and checked by 
the Publisher and, whether or not corrections have been received from the author, the Letter will then go 
ahead for publication.<P>
<P>
There are no page charges and the principal author will be sent free of charge 50 offprints of the Letter.<P>
<P>
Contributors to <I>Philosophical Magazine Letters</I> should send their manuscripts to Professor E. A. 
Davis, Philosophical Magazine Letters, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, 
University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK; or to Dr S. R. Elliott, Philosophical Magazine Letters, 
Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge C132 ITQ, UK<P>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>A Short History of Taylor &amp;  Francis</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The foundations of Taylor &amp;  Francis were laid in pioneering fashion in 1798. Richard Taylor printed 
and launched the <I>Philosophical Magazine</I> , one of the first scientific journals published by an 
independent company.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "../PML.gif" ></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>The cover of <I>Philosophical Magazine Letters</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
It was the start of a close collaboration with scholarly societies which was cultivated throughout the 
1880s.  The company became the printer for the Royal Astronomical Society , the Geological Society, the 
Zoological Society, the Horticultural Society, the Royal Botanical Society, the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science, the Royal Society and the Linnean Society of London.  With the proliferation of 
periodicals and information generated and information generated by learned societies at the turn of the 
century, Taylor &amp;  Francis also became pioneers in the field of abstracting journals, and in 1890 the 
company became the first printer of <I>Science Abstracts</I>  the precursor of todays<I> Physics 
Abstracts</I>.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG BORDER = 1 SRC = "rtaylor.gif" >
<P>
<H5>Richard Taylor (1781-1858)</H5></CENTER>
Dr William Francis, a chemist, joined Richard Taylor in 1852 and established the tradition of close links 
between the scientific community and the company. Less than a century later, in 1936, Taylor &amp;  
Francis became a private limited company with leading scientists as directors and shareholders. The 
company is still actively directed by a group of highly distinguished academics, and has Sir Nevill Mott as 
its honorary President.<P>

<TITLE>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The aims of <I>Cybernetics and Systems</I> are to disseminate information about important 
methodological developments in cybernetics, enabling scientists from different areas to use these methods 
in their research, to focus on important new applications of cybernetic methods in different areas in order 
to encourage application of these methods to problems, and to inform the scientific community of new 
books, ongoing research in specific institutions, forthcoming conferences, and institutional and personal 
changes.  Each paper submitted for publication will be judged by its originality, adequacy of method, 
significance of findings, and relevance to the journal's subject matter.  It should be as concise as possible, 
yet sufficiently detailed to permit critical review.  If a paper, or substantial parts of it, have been published 
or committed elsewhere, it will not be accepted for publication in this journal.<P>
<P>
<H4>How to submit a manuscript</H4>
Authors should send two copies of their manuscripts (prepared according to the instructions below), 
including reproducible figures, to the appropriate Editor/Associate Editor who will then proceed with the 
review process.  If authors are uncertain which editor has responsibility for a particular field of work, they 
may send their papers to the Editor. All accepted manuscripts, artwork, and photographs become the 
property of the publisher.<P>
<P>
<H4>Transfer of copyright</H4>
All papers accepted for publication must be accompanied by a copyright release form signed by the author.  
The form is available from the Editor.  If any figure, table, or more than 100 words of text from previously 
published material are included in a manuscript, the author must obtain written permission for 
republication from the copyright holder.<P>
<P>
<H4>General typing instructions</H4>
All manuscripts must be typed doublespaced (this includes especially reference lists), on only one side of 
the paper with margins of at least 1" all around.<P>
<P>
<H4>Title, authors, and affiliations</H4>
Page 1 of the paper should contain a brief, clear, and descriptive article title (10 words or fewer); the names 
and institutional affiliations of all authors; an abbreviated title (maximum of 40 characters); and the name, 
complete mailing address and phone and fax numbers of the person to whom all correspondence and proof 
should be sent.<P>
<P>
<H4>Abstract</H4>
Every paper must have an abstract (on page 1 or 2) of about 50-150 words.<P>
<P>
<H4>Introduction</H4>
Explains the purpose of the study, cites relevant work, and describes objective.<P>
<P>
<H4>Body</H4>
Gives the primary message of the paper in detail; may be broken down in several sections, which should 
not be numbered.  Appropriate figures and tables may be used.<P>
<P>
<H4>Equations</H4>
Be especially careful in typing equations; they are very expensive to typeset and correct.  Be sure all 
symbols are clear; mark unconventional or ambiguous symbols or requirements (or explain on a separate 
sheet); underline vectors with a wavy line for boldface.<P>
<P>
<H4>Discussion</H4>
Point out the significance of the work, its limitations and advantages, applications of the results; may 
recommend further work.  Should be related to existing knowledge in the area and the importance of this 
study's contribution to the advancement of the field; should be based on the experimental data 
obtained.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
Alphabetize the reference list by author and doublespace it in a separate section at the end of the paper; cite 
in text by author and date.  References should follow The Chicago Manual of Style, 14th ed.  Include in the 
reference list only those cited in text; reference only published or "in press" material<P>
<P>
<H4>Footnotes</H4>
Use sparingly if at all.  Any footnote of acknowledgement or author identification will appear on the 
opening page of the paper, not keyed to the title or author's name by superscript number or symbol.  
Number all other text footnotes consecutively throughout the paper and compile them on a separate page at 
the end of the manuscript.<P>
<P>
<H4>Tables and figures</H4>
Number each consecutively with single Arabic numerals (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1 , Table 2); 
briefly and descriptively title each and refer to it in the text.  Tables: Type each on a separate page; key 
footnotes by superscript lowercase letters.  Figures: Type legends on a separate page at end of manuscript.  
Draw line illustrations clearly in India ink on good-quality white paper or vellum; clearly label them in ink 
or by typewriter.  Submit either original drawings or good-quality photographic prints of them.  
Photographs should be sharp black-and-white glossies (5 X 7" or 8 X 10").  Four-color illustrations will be 
considered for publication; however, the author will be required to bear the full cost involved in their 
printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,200.  Subsequent figures, totalling no more 
than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each.  Good quality color prints should be provided, in their final size.  
Figures needing reduction or enlargement will be charged an additional 25 percent.  The publisher has the 
right to refuse publication of color prints deemed unacceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>Spelling</H4>
Follow Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed.).<P>
<P>
<H4>Proofs and authors' alterations</H4>
One set of page proofs is sent to the specified author.  Please check carefully and return promptly.  You 
will be charged for proof changes that require excessive resetting of lines.<P>
<P>
<H4>Reprints</H4>
Each author of the article will receive a complete copy of the issue in which the article appears, up to a 
total of 3 copies per article.  The corresponding author is responsible for distribution of copies to 
coauthors.  Reprints of an individual article may be ordered from Taylor &amp  Francis.  Use the reprint 
order form included with page proofs.<P>

should be preceded by a Summary (maximum length 200 words) which should be a summary of the entire 
paper, not of the conclusions alone.<P>
<H4>8. The paper</H4>
should be reasonably sub divided into sections and, if necessary, subsections. <P>
<H4>9. Mathematical symbols</H4>
may be either hand written or typewritten.  Greek letters and unusual symbols should be identified 
separately in the margin.  Distinction should be made between capital and lower case letters; between the 
letter O and zero; between the letter I, the number one and prime; between k and kappa.<P>
<H4>10. Computer programs and computer graph plots</H4>
should be given on an original print-out on plain white paper and will be reproduced photo-graphically to 
avoid errors.<P>
<H4>11. Half-tone illustrations</H4>
are to be restricted in number to the minimum necessary.  Good glossy bromide prints should accompany 
the manuscripts and should not be attached to manuscript pages. Photographs should be enlarged 
sufficiently to permit clear reproduction in half-tone after reduction.  If words or numbers are to appear on 
a photograph two prints should be sent, the lettering being clearly indicated on one print only.<P>
<H4>12.  Original line drawings</H4>
(not photo prints) should be submitted and should include all relevant details.  Drawings should be about 
twice the final size and it is desirable that the lettering should be in pencil.  If not, the lettering must be 
clear and 'open' and sufficiently large to permit the necessary reduction of size in block-making.<P>
<H4>13.  Figure legends</H4>
should be typed on a separate sheet and placed at the end of the manuscript.  The amount of lettering on a 
drawing should be reduced as far as possible by transferring it to the legend.<P>
<H4>14.  It is the author's responsibility</H4>
to obtain written permission to quote material which has appeared in another publication.<P>
<H4>15.  Tables </H4>
should be numbered consecutively and titled.  All table columns should have an explanatory heading.  
Tables should not repeat data which are available elsewhere in the paper, e.g. in a line diagram.<P>
<H4>16.  References</H4>
to published literature should be quoted in the text thus: [1], and grouped together at the end of the paper in 
numerical order.  Journal references should be arranged thus:<P>
[1] KNOWLES, J. K., and REISSNER, E., 1958, J. Math.  Phys., 37, 269.<P>
Book references should be given as follows:<P>
[2] CARSLAW, H. S and JAEGER, J. C., 1953, Operational Methods in Applied Mathematics, second 
edition (London: Oxford University Press).<P>
<H4>17.  While no standard system</H4>
of notation is at present mandatory, it would be appreciated if matrices were given in either bold capitals, 
e.g. K or brackets [] and vectors as bold lower case letters, e.g. k or {k}. Symbol ()T is to  be used for 
transpose.  Authors are requested to define symbols as they appear in the text book lists of symbols may be 
given in an Appendix.<P>
<H4>18.  A section of 'Letters to the Editor'</H4>
(each limited to 500 words) will provide a forum for discussion of recent problems, developments, etc.<P>
<H4>19.  No manuscript or figures will be returned</H4>
following publication unless a request for return is made when the manuscript is originally submitted.<P>
<H4>20.  The publisher will do everything possible to ensure 
prompt publication.</H4>
It will therefore be appreciated if manuscripts and illustrations conform from the outset to the style of the 
journal. Corrected page proofs must be returned to the Editor within three days to minimize the risk of the 
author's contribution having to be held over to a later issue.<P>

<CENTER><H3>COMPARATIVE STRATEGY - AN 
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL</H3>
<H3>Instructions to Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
COMPARATIVE STRATEGY is a journal devoted to the elucidation of the principles and practice of 
grand strategy in the contemporary world. It is dedicated to a revitalization of contemporary strategic 
thought by way of a full integration of theoretical perspectives, empirical investigation, and historical 
understanding as applied to the strategic problems of the present.<P>
The principle focus of the journal is strategic thought and the influence of history and ideas on 
international relations. Some areas of particular interest include: (1) theories of deterrence and conflict 
avoidance; (2) the political and strategic dimensions of arms control; (3) strategic intelligence, deception, 
and surprise; (4) geopolitics; (5) strategic alliances and regional security; (6) theory and dynamics of 
Russian defense and foreign policies in all their dimensions; (7) theories of liberal democracy, nationalism, 
imperialism, and totalitarianism; (8) military force relationships at the strategic and operational levels; (9) 
competing theories of political economy, capitalism, socialism, and communism; (10) European economic 
and political integration; (1 1) the emergence of unified Germany and its role in Europe and the world; (12) 
strategic economic, scientific technical, and demographic factors;  (13) military organization, education, 
and training as they relate to strategy; (1 4) new interpretations of great strategists of the past, both theorists 
and practitioners, as well as analyses of the relevance of political theory and philosophy to strategic 
approaches and methods. Articles concerning particular regions authored by local writers are encouraged, 
and will be featured whenever possible under a section devoted to local commentary and analysis of 
regional issues.<P>

measurements, medical images of all kinds, primary care information and epidemiology.  The journal is 
also concerned with the gathering and organization of data and will include applications to medical 
education.  Papers should have a sound theoretical base, and will not be simply ad hoc applications of 
techniques. Contributions may be submitted either as full papers (4000 words), which report original 
research or clinical work, or reinterpret existing knowledge; or as short papers (500-1000 words), which 
report techniques or preliminary results.  The journal also publishes review papers (6000 words): authors 
proposing a review paper should contact the editor in advance.<P>

<P>
The new broad-based <I>International Journal of Optoelectronics</I> incorporating Optical Computing 
&amp  Processing provides a forum for engineers and scientists involved in optoelectronic materials, 
systems and signal processing and brings together within one journal contributions from a wide range of 
disciplines.  There will be three major subject areas, as follows.<P>
<P>
<H4>Materials:</H4>
the development of successful optoelectronic systems is critically dependent on the development of current 
and new optoelectronic materials.  Materials of interest include silicon, germanium and III-V compounds.  
Papers on quantum-well structures, the development of short-wavelength lasers, VCSELs, nonlinear 
performance of materials, special devices for switching applications such as SEEDs and materials with 
optical gain as found in seminconductor optical amplifiers and fibre amplifiers will be welcomed.  Novel 
applications of glasses and ferroelectric materials will also be included.  <P>
<P>
<H4>Systems:</H4>
the exploitation of optoelectronic materials to form optoelectronic systems. Telecommunication, computer 
communication and sensor systems are all candidates for inclusion.  Applications of nonlinear materials to 
provide switching, and novel traffic routing methods such as wavelength division multiplexing and 
wavelength switching will also be welcome.  High-speed transmission and solitons are important topics to 
include, as is analogue transmission-which has seen a resurgence of interest with CATV applications.  The 
exploitation of optoelectronic methods to provide novel sensors will also be welcomed.<P>
<P>
<H4>Computing and Signal processing:</H4>
modern optical and optoelectronic systems have developed to such an extent that significant amounts of 
signal processing can be performed and this is a very important growth area.  Papers dealing with analogue 
and digital processing, optical interconnects and optical storage are welcomed, as are papers on algorithms 
and architectures for optical and optoelectronic processing, and industrial applications of optical computing 
and signal processing.<P>
<P>
<H4>Types of contribution</H4>
Contributions must report original research not being considered elsewhere.  They are subject to review by 
referees.<P>
<P>
<H4>Papers:</H4>
Full-length papers of up to about 8000 words (or 30 typed pages).<P>
<P>
<H4>Letters:</H4>
Timely and important topics that will be given rapid refereeing and priority publication.  Letters should not 
exceed about 1000 words (or 4 typed pages).<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscripts</H4>
Three copies of the manuscript and figures should be included in submissions of papers together with one 
set of high quality figures for reproduction.<P>
The manuscripts should be typed in double spacing on one side of plain paper in the following order.<P>
(a) Title page including authors' names, full postal addresses, telephone and tax numbers and e-mail 
addresses.<P>
(b) Abstract of about 50-100 words.<P>
(c) Main text.<P>
(d) Acknowledgements.<P>

<TITLE>NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Aims and Scope</H4>
The aims of the <I>International Journal of Science Education</I> are to:<P>
report major advances in the theory and practice of research into science education, <P>
disseminate the outcomes of research into science education;<P>
facilitate the transfer and cross-fertilization of knowledge about science education between countries and 
with other areas of enquiry;<P>
promote the understanding of the interactions between science education and language, culture, industry, 
politics and economics.<P>
<P>
The journal attaches considerable importance to applicable research, i.e., research capable of being applied 
to educational practice.  Studies of all aspects of science education, i.e., informal, primary, secondary, 
higher, adult and continuing, and vocational, are regarded as of equal importance.<P>
The journal carries four types of article.  General Articles are concise and critical reviews of existing 
research into an aspect of science education, discussions of research methodology, the presentation of new 
perspectives on research or practice in science education.  Innovations and Developments are accounts of 
how an innovation or development was produced, of its nature, together with an evaluation of its use in 
practice.  Research Reports are accounts of qualitative or quantitative enquiries, presenting conclusions and 
implications of future research and practice against the background of a critical review of relevant literature 
and an account of the methods and procedures used.  Book Reviews are short reviews of books which are 
of interest to those conducting, or using the outcomes of, research in science education.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Manuscripts</H4>
Authors are reminded that the journal aims at a wide international readership. Papers should contain a clear 
description of the general and specific settings to which they relate. They should also point out the 
relevance of results and insights to other settings.<P>
Papers submitted for publication should not be under consideration by any other journal.  They should be 
original, written in English, and should not generally exceed 5000 words in length.  Papers should 
normally be in the passive voice and be sensitive to gender issues.  The first page of manuscripts should 
consist only of the title of the paper, the authors' names and institutional affiliations, and full details 
(including telephone, fax and email numbers) for correspondence with the main author.  The second page 
of manuscripts should begin with the title and a summary, of up to 150 words, which should be an abstract 
of the whole paper, but should not contain the author(s) name.  Manuscripts should be typed, double-
spaced with wide margins, and be submitted in triplicate.  Notes at the bottom of pages are discouraged:  
all material should be included in the text or be set out as Notes at the end of the paper.  Papers may 
include relevant, concise appendices.  The conventions on the layout of text, figures, and diagrams, may be 
inferred from recent issues of the journal.  Each figure/table for publication should be submitted with the 
copies of the manuscript on separate sheets and be suitable for reprography.<P>
Manuscripts will only be sent to referees when they conform to the following conventions on references.  
Where an author's name in included in a sentence, the reference should be given as Able (1990).  Where 
author(s) names are given at the end of a sentence, the references) should be given as (Baker 1991, Charlie 
1992, Delta and Echo 1993).  No use should be made of et al. and op. cit.  Full bibliographic details should 
be listed, under References, at the end of the article, in alphabetical order by authors' surnames, as 
follows:<P>

<TITLE>Information for Authors </TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Information for Authors </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>1. General policy.</H4>
<I>Social Epistemology</I> (SEP) does not normally publish traditional scholarly articles as isolated 
pieces of research.  Since the journal is committed to both examining and exhibiting the social structure of 
knowledge, our policy is to publish 'collaborations' that are the collective product of several contributors. 
Among the different types of collaborations included in SEP are critical syntheses, provocations, 
applications, interviews, open peer commentaries, book reviews and responses, and journal surveys.  The 
number of each type included in each number will vary, and readers are strongly encouraged to contribute 
or to suggest to the editor who would be an appropriate contributor to any type of collaboration.<P>
<P>
<H4>2. Submissions.</H4>
Most of the journal's articles are commissioned.  However, the editor strongly encourages people with 
ideas (and specific authors) for special issues of the journal to contact him. We are especially interested in 
pursuing special issues that fall between the cracks of existing disciplinary boundaries or that involve 
collaborations between academics and non-academics.  E-mail is the preferred medium for initial contact.  
All articles, whether commissioned or unsolicited, are refereed, but the journal is under no obligation to 
referee individual unsolicited articles.  Authors may be asked to provide diskettes containing their articles 
in ASCII or one of the conventional word processing programmes.<P>
<P>
<H4>3. Critical syntheses</H4>
survey the literatures of several different disciplines concerned with a problem of interest to the sociology 
of knowledge.  They are designed to be written in as jargon-neutral a manner possible so as to allow co-
workers in the different disciplines to recognise each other as engaged in roughly the same tasks.  A 
recommended way of organising the materials for a critical synthesis is to proceed historically.  The critical 
synthesis should also evaluate the field of research it describes, indicating the fruitful and fruitless avenues 
of research (with the full realisation that objections may ensue in subsequent numbers).  Normally a critical 
synthesis will have several contributions.<P>
<P>
<H4>4. Provocations</H4>
are short pieces designed to make a polemical point that can be challenged by readers in subsequent 
numbers.  Perhaps they are the seeds of a thesis that a contributor wants ultimately to bring to fruition as a 
book, or simply issues that the contributor does not feel have been addressed adequately elsewhere.<P>
<P>
<H4>5. Applications</H4>
are short pieces that discuss the consequences of applying certain theoretical approaches to knowledge to 
such practical contexts as the classroom, cultural critique, the laboratory, field research, and public 
administration.<P>
<P>
<H4>6. Interviews</H4>
are normally conducted by the editor with a notable figure concerned with issues in social epistemology.  
They are meant to be both informative and critical.  Readers with an interest in being an interviewer 
(especially if they have a particular interviewee in mind) are encouraged to contact the editor.<P>
<P>
<H4>7. Open peer commentaries</H4>
consist of a lead article, often a synopsis of a major text in social epistemology, followed by about twenty 
responses, followed, in turn, by a response by the author of the lead article.<P>
<P>
<H4>8. Book reviews and responses.</H4>
The idea here is that book reviews are not published unless coupled with a response by either the author or 
her/his defender.  The editor encourages authors of recently published books in the conceptual vicinity of 
social epistemology to suggest informed (though not overly sympathetic) reviewers.<P>
<P>
<H4>9. Surveys.</H4>
Journal and anthology editors who publish articles of interest to Social Epistemology are encouraged to 
send summaries (or even just copies) of the relevant article.  The editorial staff will likewise compile a 
catalogue of relevant articles.<P>
<P>
<H4>10. Style.</H4>
Manuscripts should be typed, double-spaced with wide margins, on one side of the sheet only.  Use good 
quality, A4 or functional equivalent paper.  Pages should be numbered consecutively.  Submit the original, 
top copy.  SE follows the University of Chicago Press's Manual of Style and the Concise Oxford 
Dictionary. References in the text should be marked by a raised numeral, thus.' Each reference should be 
numbered consecutively.  Citations should be given at the end of the text as follows:<P>
1. MANNHEIM, K. Structure of Thinking, Routledge &amp  Kegan Paul, London (1986), p. 32.<P>
2. BLOOR, D. 'Durkheim and Mauss revisited: classification and the sociology of knowledge', Studies in 
History and Philosophy of Science, 13 (1982), pp. 267-298. Subsequent references to sources cited earlier 
should be given as:<P>
3. MANNHEIM (1986), p. 33 (see note 1).<P>
4. BLOOR (1982), p. 274 (see note 2).<P>
Avoid the use of ibid., op. cit., loc. cit., art. cit.  <P>
To reflect SEP's interdisciplinary character, other styles of referencing (e.g., the author/date system) are 
acceptable, provided they are accessible and consistently applied. <P>
All proofs will be corrected by the Editor, unless special arrangements are made.  In any case, no 
amendments to the text can be made at proof stage.<P>
<P>

The aim of <I>Studies in Conflict and Terrorism</I> is to cast light on all conflicts, their motivations, and 
their forms as they are now being waged in varying degrees of intensity in different parts of the world. 
Many of the conflicts of the 1990s will involve ethnic or religious differences, while others will be based 
on social or historical issues, and still others will he plain criminal acts.  Ethnic and religious conflicts in 
particular are likely to increase in number throughout the world.  Although some of these conflicts may be 
based on the search for identity or a need for faith in a materialistic world, some will have political or 
socioeconomic roots, and many will have elements of all these factors.  This journal will publish the 
theoretical and empirical studies that best contribute to an understanding of the causes of conflicts, as well 
as to the strategies and tactics of the groups conducting them, in order to deal with them more effectively 
and to promote orderly socioeconomic improvements and world peace.<P>

<H4>References</H4>
Literature citations in the text should be by author's name and year; when references are by three or more 
authors abbreviate to the first name and et al.: "Smith ( 1982) has shown ... Previous work (Smith &amp  
Jones, 1982; Jackson, 1983a, b) has demonstrated that . . . Jackson et al. (1982) have shown that. . . ." The 
list of References should be given in alphabetical order, with all authors and editors listed.  Full titles and 
full pagination of publications should be given.  Follow the examples shown:<P>

<P>
<H4>Tables</H4>
Each table should be typed on a separate page, and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals.  The 
headings should be sufficiently clear so that the meaning of the data will be understandable without 
reference to the text.  Explanatory footnotes to tables are encouraged and they should be indicated by 
lowercase, italic, superscript letters, beginning with ` in each table.  Do not use vertical lines to separate 
columns.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations (Figures)</H4>
The number of illustrations (line drawings, wherever possible) should be limited to the minimum needed to 
clarify the text.  Double documentation in figures and tables is not acceptable.  Graphs moist have a 
professionally prepared quality. Clear printouts from laser printers (or equivalent devices) on quality paper 
are acceptable.  No part of the drawing should be typewritten. Individual figures should be prepared at 
approximately 15 x 18 cm size; they will be reduced to the printing width of 12.5 cm, and all elements in 
the drawing should be clearly legible at this reduction. The letters and symbols should be approx. 2 mm 
high after reduction.  It is preferable to include the legend of symbols in the graph.  All terms, 
abbreviations, and symbols must correspond with those in the text.  Each illustration should be identified 
by the authors' names and figure number, preferably written in a clear corner area.  One original set of all 
figures (photographs, line drawings) must be submitted as sharp, glossy, high quality prints (Xerox-type 
prints are not accepted) along with three xerographic copies of the originals.  Photographs should exhibit a 
high contrast.  Arrows, letters, and numbers should be inserted preferably with template rub-on letters.  
Micrographs should have an internal magnification marker: the magnification should also be stated in the 
legend.<P>
<P>
Four-color illustrations will be considered for publication; however, the author will be required to bear the 
full cost involved in their printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,200.  Subsequent 
figures, totalling no more than 4 text pages, are $500 each.  Good quality color prints should be provided, 
in their final size.  Figures needing reduction or enlargement will be charged an additional 25 percent.  The 
publisher has the right to refuse publication of color prints deemed unacceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>Legends to Figures</H4>
Each illustration should be provided with a legend sufficiently clear so that the meaning of data is 
understandable without reference to the text.  Phrases such as "For explanation, see text" are unacceptable.  
A legend of symbols used should be included in a graph; those not included in the graph should be 
described in the legend (e.g., "open circle").  Legends should be typed on a separate page, placed at the end 
of the manuscript.<P>
<P>
<H4>Units of measurement and abbreviations</H4>
Use of the International System of Units (SI, Systeme International d'Unites) is required.  In the text and 
tables use the minus index (e.g., ug h -1) instead of a slash and conform with the SI abbreviations.  Use 
chemical designations instead of spelling out common chemical names (e.g., "CO2 release, C and N 
cycling, HCl, N2-fixation").  Define each uncommon abbreviation and introduce it in parentheses the first 
time it is used, e.g., "modified universal buffer (MUB) was used."<P>
 The conventional designation of author's name(s) of a binomial scientific name of organism must be noted 
the first time the name of the organism is introduced (except in the title).  Fertilizer values should be 
expressed in terms of P, K, etc., not P2O5, K2O, etc.<P>
<P>
<H4>Notes</H4>
Notes, not exceeding 1200 words, are intended for the presentation of brief research reports that do not 
warrant full-length papers.  The Notes receive the same review, and they are not considered preliminary 
communications.  Each Note must have an Abstract of no more than 100 words and Keywords.  Do not use 
section headings in the body of the Note.  The number of figures and tables should be kept to a minimum.  
The References section is identical to that of full-length papers.<P>
<P>
<H4>Permission to reprint</H4>
Whenever a manuscript contains material (tables, figures, or more than 100 words of quoted material) 
protected by copyright, authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce copyrighted material 
from other sources, and are required to sign an agreement for the transfer of copyright to the publisher.<P>
<P>
<H4>Page proofs</H4>
Proofs will be sent to authors for checking before publication.  Corrections to proofs must be marked 
clearly by using conventional practice and symbols (consult, e.g., Merriam-Webster International 
Dictionary, section on marking page proofs).<P>
<P>
<H4>Reprints</H4>
The corresponding author of each article will receive 50 free reprints of the article.  Additional reprints 
may be ordered from Taylor &amp  Francis.  Use the reprint order form included with page proofs.<P>
<P>
The Editorial Board and Publishers reserve the right to edit all manuscripts linguistically and 
stylistically.<P>

GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL provides a unified vehicle for the publication of research and review 
articles in the rapidly growing field of geomicrobiology.  Articles deal with microbial transformations of 
materials comprising the earth's crust, including oceans, seas, lakes, bottom sediments, soils, mineral 
deposits, and rocks, and the geologic impact that these transformations have at present or have had over 
geologic time.  In this context, the functions of bacteria, yeasts, fungi, microalgac, protozoans, and related 
microorganisms and their activity in the geomicrobial context, or the geological consequences of 
geomicrobial activity, are addressed.  GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL covers basic topics such as 
microbial roles in formation and degradation of specific minerals, mineralization of organic matter, 
biogeochemical cycling of elements, isotopic fractionation and palcomicrobiology, and applied topics such 
as fossil fuel microbiology, the microbiology involved with bioleaching of ores, geomicrobiological 
prospecting, and groundwater microbiology.<P>
<P>
Manuscripts should be sent in triplicate to the editor nearest you: Henry L. Ehrlich, Department of Biology, 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180-3590, USA, or Wolfgang E. Krumbein,

<CENTER><H3>Information for Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Manuscripts will be accepted with the understanding that their content is unpublished and is not being 
submitted for publication elsewhere.  All accepted manuscripts and artwork become the property of the 
publisher.  If any part of the paper has been published previously, or is to be published elsewhere, the 
author must include this information at the time of submittal. Manuscripts should be submitted to Donna 
Casarez, Managing Editor, Tetra Tech Data Systems Inc., 2451A Impala Drive, Carlsbad, CA 92008.<P>
<P>
<H4>Form</H4>
Submit an original and two copies of the paper, in English, reproduced on one side of good quality opaque 
paper about 21.5 X 28 cm (81/2 X 11 in.) in size. (An additional copy should be kept by the author.) Type 
the text and references double spaced.  Allow wide margins of at least 3 cm (1 in.) on all sides of the typed 
pages.  Number manuscript pages consecutively throughout the paper.<P>
<P>
<H4>Affiliation</H4>
On the title page include (in the following order) title, names of authors, affiliations and the address of the 
author to whom proofs and correspondence should be sent.<P>
<P>
<H4>Abstract</H4>
An informative abstract of not more that 100 words should state the principal results of the paper succinctly 
and numerically: "The 9.5 um hydroxyl absorption line was reduced to only 2.1 dB/km in the new glass by 
two cycles of purification in a  However, an abstract of a review paper will be merely a condensed table of 
contents.  An abstract describing a new method may be mere description instead of numerical results: "We 
have opened a new process for fabricating fiber-optic cables and departs from traditional methods by...."  
Or, "A new mathematical formalism permits simplified solutions to many fiber propagation problems in 
the ray-optics limit. It hinges on...."<P>
<P>
<H4>Spelling, Hyphenation, and Scientific Notation</H4>
The spelling and hyphenation authority is Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition.  The 
System International (SI) or modern metric units are to be used.  If some data are traditionally quoted in the 
English system, they can be put in parentheses following the metric unit, e.g., 0.47 GN/m2 (68,000 
psi).<P>
<P>
<H4>Equations</H4>
Equations should be neatly typed or written in ink, punctuated, and aligned to bring out their structure, and 
numbered on the right.  Use X rather than a centered dot, except for scalar products of vectors.  The 
diagonal line (/) should be used instead of built-up fractions in the running text, and in display unless the 
denominator is complicated.  The symbol exp [ ] instead of e( ) should be used for complicated arguments 
of the exponential function.<P>
<P>
<H4>Figures</H4>
All figures must be submitted in a form suitable for good quality reproduction and be drawn on separate 
sheets.  The lettering should be sufficiently large to withstand production to an ll-cm (41/2 in.) width of 
page and still be at least 1.5 mm (1/16 in.) high; a minimum of 3 mm (1/8 in.) is preferable.  Either black 
ink line drawings or glossy photographs are acceptable. Photocopies are not acceptable.  Number figures 
according to the sequence of their appearance in text, referring to them as Fig. 1, etc.  On the back (or in 
the margin) of each figure, give the figure number, name of author, and title of this journal.  Each figure 
should have its own caption, and all captions should be typed double spaced on a separate page. Four-color 
illustrations will be considered for publication; however, the author will be required to bear the full cost 
involved in their printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,200.  Subsequent figures, 
totalling no more than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each. Good quality color prints should be provided, in 
their final size.  Figures needing reduction or enlargement will he charged an additional 25 percent.  The 
publisher has the right to refuse publication of color prints deemed unacceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>Tables</H4>
All tables must be discussed or mentioned in the text, numbered with arabic numerals in order of mention, 
and typed on separate sheets: do not include them within the text.  Each table should have a brief 
descriptive title.  Do not include explanatory material in the title; use footnotes, keyed to the table with 
letters as opposed to numbers.  Place all footnotes to a table at the end of the table.  Define all data in the 
column heads.<P>
<P>
<H4>Footnotes</H4>
All footnotes should be numbered in order of first appearance by a superscript arabic numeral following 
the period that ends the sentence in which the footnote is quoted.  The footnotes should be listed on a 
separate page in the manuscript although they will appear in final print on the same page where the quote is 
made.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
References must be typed on a separate sheet and numbered consecutively in the order of their first 
appearance in the text.  Within the text the reference numbers should be set in brackets [ ]. The references, 
on the separate sheet, should use the format from the Chicago Manual of Style, 14th ed.  See examples 
provided below.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Notes for contributors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Scope of the journal</H4>
The <I>IJRB</I> publishes original research and review papers on the effects of ionizing, ultraviolet and 
visible radiation, accelerated particles, microwaves, ultrasound, heat and related modalities.  The focus is 
on the biological effects of such radiations: from radiation chemistry to the whole spectrum of responses of 
living organisms and the underlying mechanisms, including genetic abnormalities, repair phenomena, cell 
death, dose-modifying agents, and tissue responses.  Applications of basic studies to medical uses of 
radiation extend the scope of the journal to a variety of practical problems such as physical modifications 
and the chemical adjuvants which improve the effectiveness of radiation in cancer therapy.  Assessment of 
the hazards of low doses of radiation is also considered.<P>
<P>
<H4>Submission</H4>
Contributions should be sent to: The Editor, International Journal of Radiation Biology, Radiotherapy 
Research Unit,  Institute of Cancer Research, Cotswold Road, Sutton, Surrey  SM2 5NG, UK. Tel: 0181 
043 8901. Fax: 0181 770 7893.  Email: gordons@icr.ac.UK. Papers will be considered for publication on 
the understanding that the authors do not intend to submit them for publication elsewhere.  The 
corresponding author must have prior agreement from the authors to submit the manuscript.  The Editors 
will be free to make minor textual amendments but authors can check the copy in proof.  Proofs will be 
sent to the corresponding author, who must return them within 48 hours of receipt.  Printers' errors only 
may be corrected; any other amendments will be charged to the author.  If a manuscript is not accepted, 
one copy and the original illustrations will be returned.  Papers involving animals must include a statement 
concerning the national or institutional regulations under which the studies were performed.  Papers may 
be rejected if procedures disregard the welfare of experimental animals.  Papers involving humans must 
include a statement concerning the permission obtained for the studies from an appropriate Ethical 
Committee.<P>
<P>
<H4>Contributions may be of six types:</H4>
1) Papers accompanied by an abstract of not more than 200 words, including Introduction, Materials and 
methods. Results, Discussion, and References.<P>
(2) Rapid Communications of preliminary accounts of important observations where early publication is 
highly, desirable.  Authors must submit an accompanying statement to the Editor justifying urgent 
publication.  Rapid Communications should normally be restricted in length to two printed pages of the 
journal.  Supplementary data, not to be published, may be submitted for referees' consideration. Separate 
headings (for example Introduction, Materials and methods) may not be needed but a one-sentence 
summary should be provided.  With the full co-operation of authors, and if no revisions are required, Rapid 
Communications can be published within approximately four months of submission.<P>
(3) Reviews of around 10 to 15 printed pages accompanied by an abstract of not more than 200 words.  
Authors are invited by the Editor; suggestions from readers are welcome.  Review authors receive a 
complimentary book of their choice from the current Taylor &amp  Francis catalogue<P>
(4) Current Topics articles of two or four printed pages in length, providing overviews on a wide range of 
subject areas including aspects of radiation in the environment, its effect on chemical and biological 
systems, and its use for example in therapy.  Authors are invited by the Editor;  suggestions from readers 
are welcome.<P>
(5) Technical Notes (up to two printed pages) or Technical Reports (up to four printed pages) describing 
new or modified techniques, assays, or methods of analysis <P>
(6) Letters to the Editor, comprising comment on topical subjects, matters arising from published articles, 
but not presenting primary data, acceptance of which will not imply concurrence in the views expressed by 
the writer.  These are accepted on the understanding that they may be sent for comment to the authors of 
the articles being discussed.  <P>
<P>
<H4>Meeting or Symposium reports are also published</H4>
Contact the Editor well in advance of the meeting for details.<P>
<P>
<H4>Contributions should be in English</H4>
If authors wish to provide foreign language abstracts of papers they should refer to the Notice in Volume 
43.  FIVE copies of contributions are required, typed 10 or 12 characters per inch on one side of A4 sized 
paper, double-spaced, with wide margins, each page numbered.  A running title should be provided, 
together with up to five indexing phrases, for example 'DNA repair in human thyroid cells'.  Authors 
should include their telephone and fax numbers on the title page of their paper.<P>
Authors of papers involving animals or humans are requested to provide original data when feasible in the 
form of reduced-size tables either in the text or in an Appendix, for archival purposes. <P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
should be given in the text by author(s) and date (for example Smith and Brown 1992), or Smith et el.

<CENTER><H3>NOTES FOR AUTHORS</H3>
<P>
<P>
<B>GENERAL POLICY</B></CENTER><P>
Papers are published on the understanding that they have not been published before and are not 
concurrently under offer to any other journal.  Authors are required to sign a form for agreement of the 
transfer of copyright of their papers to the publisher and are responsible for obtaining permission to use 
copyright material from other sources.  Authors are expected to consider secondary literature as well as 
primary sources. They are responsible for the opinions expressed in their papers.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>LANGUAGES</B></CENTER><P>
The languages of the journal are English, French and German, but others may be accepted in 
exceptional circumstances.  Papers in foreign languages must contain an English translation of the 
summary.  Previously unpublished manuscripts should appear in their original languages (with a 
translation, if thought necessary), but extracts from published works must be translated into the language of 
the paper.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</B></CENTER><P>
Authors should follow the <I>MHRA Style Book</I>, 2nd edn, edited by A. S. Maney and R. L. 
Smallwood (London: Modern Humanities Research Association, 1978).  Manuscripts must be typed on 
good quality paper, in double spacing and with wide margins.  Footnotes should be typed out separately 
after the main text.  Extended quotations should be inset and <I>without</I> quotation marks.  Shorter 
quotations in the text should be enclosed in <I>single</I> quotation marks.  Diagrams and plates should 
be submitted separately with an indication of where they should be placed in the paper.  Pale photocopies 
of material for photographic reproduction are <B>not</B> acceptable.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>ORGANIZATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</B></CENTER><P>
Papers should not exceed 40 printed pages in length. The title page should bear the title of the paper, 
and name and full address of the author (including telephone/fax/email numbers), followed by a 
<B>Summary</B> of the paper in about ten lines.  Unless it is very short, the paper should be organized 
into numbered Sections (and, if necessary, sub-sections), with a <B>Table of Contents</B> presented 
after the summary.  The publishers will insert page numbers at the page proof stage.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES</B></CENTER><P>
Authors should be guided by the <I>MHRA Style Book</I>. Footnotes are to be numbered 
consecutively, with superscript numerals placed outside the punctuation, thus: ... Newton 
agreed.<B>27</B>  References are to be cited as follows: Elizabeth L. Eisenstein, <I>The Printing Press 
as an Agent of Change</I>, 2 vols (Cambridge, 1979), il, 575-9. Robert Fox, <I>The Caloric Theory of 
Gases: From Lavoisier to Regnault</I> (Oxford, 1971), 314. John North, 'Thomas Harriot and the First 
Telescopic Observations of Sunspots', in <I>Thomas Harriot: Renaissance Scientist</I>, edited by John

Making in the 18th Century',  <I>Vistas in Astronomy</I>, 20 (1976), 173-82.  Complete page references 
for a paper should always be given, and then the specific page if necessary.  Titles of journals should 
<B>not</B> be abbreviated.<P>
Cross-references in notes to works already cited, or to points made in previous notes or their text, should be 
made by note number, for example: 'J.  Smith (note 11), 223' or 'as indicated in note 14...'. Cross-references 
in the text should be to section or sub-section numbers.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS</B></CENTER><P>
The author should submit two copies of the manuscript to the most appropriate member of the 
Editorial Board, or, if in doubt, to the Editor (c/o the publishers).  Authors requiring the return of their 
manuscripts <B>should enclose sufficient postage</B> in some suitable form.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>PUBLICATION</B></CENTER><P>
If the paper is accepted, authors will receive a set of galley proofs, together with a form quoting prices 
for extra <B>offprints beyond the 50 that they receive gratis.</B> Substantial changes in a paper at the 
proof state <B>will be charged to the author.</B><P>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<I>Electric Machines and Power Systems</I> is a refereed journal that publishes original papers of 
permanent reference value.  The papers relate to the broad field of electromechanics, electric machines, and 
power systems.  Specific topics include: rotating electric machines-new methods of analysis, computation, 
and design; advances in materials used in electric machines (for example, permanent magnets, 
superconductors, etc.); solid-state control of electric machines; linear motors; new types of electric 
machines; electromagnetic fields in energy converters; control aspect of electric machines; power system 
planning, reliability and security; transmission and distribution; dispatching and scheduling; high-voltage 
dc systems; and power system protection.  The journal also publishes review papers, correspondence items, 
and book reviews.<P>
<P>
<H4>How to Submit a Manuscript</H4>
<H4>Organization:</H4>
Manuscripts usually consist of these parts: title, names and institutional affiliations of all authors, abstract, 
introduction, body, conclusions, and references.  Appendixes, acknowledgements, and a list of symbols are 
sometimes desirable.<P>
<P>
The title should clearly and briefly cover the subject of the paper. An abstract (of about 200 words) should 
be self-explanatory and summarize the paper's essential qualities.  The introduction should spell out the 
problem, briefly review previous work, and state the purpose and significance of the paper.  The body, 
which gives the primary message of the paper in detail, may be broken down into several sections.  The 
contributions made by the author(s) should be clearly stated.  Appropriate figures and tables may be used 
to amplify the text discussion.  Each should be numbered consecutively, using Arabic numerals (e.g., Fig. 
1, Fig. 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc.). All figures and tables should be referred to in the text, in their numerical 
order (i.e., do not refer to Fig. 3 before Fig. 2).<P>
<P>
Conclusions should point out the significance of the work, its limitations and advantages, applications of 
the results, and may make recommendations for further work.  References, grouped into a section at the 
end of the paper, should be numbered in the order in which they are referred to in the text and should 
follow the format recommended by the IEEE: <P>
<P>
1. D. C. White and H. H. Woodson, Electromechanical Energy Conversion, New York: John Wiley &amp  
Sons, 1959, pp. 100-108.<P>
2. J. A. Rich and G. A. Farrall, 'Vacuum arc recovery phenomena,' Proc.  IEEE, vol. 52, pp. 1293-1301, 
November 1964.<P>
<P>
References to unpublished work or to work not properly indexed should not be used. In the use of symbols 
and units, authors should follow usages of the IEEE or the IEE (London).  Le Systeme International 
d'Unites (S1) units are mandatory.<P>
<P>
<H4>Transfer of copyright:</H4>
All papers accepted for publication must be accompanied by a copyright release form signed by the author.  
This form is available from the editor.  Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce 
copyrighted material from other sources.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation and submission of manuscript and 
Illustrations</H4>
The complete paper must be typed double spaced, with about 1 1/2" left and 1"' right margins.  The entire 
text, except the abstract, should be divided into sections and numbered using the decimal system.  
Manuscript pages should be numbered consecutively.  At the review stage, neatly drawn sketches are 
acceptable for the illustrations; legible copies of any photographs to be used should be included.  Four-
color illustrations will be considered for publication; however, the author will be required to bear the full 
cost involved in their printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,200.  Subsequent 
figures, totalling no more than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each.  Good quality color prints should be 
provided, in their final size.  Figures needing reduction or enlargement will be charged an additional 25 
percent.  The publisher has the right to refuse publication of color prints deemed unacceptable. Be sure that 
every figure has a brief descriptive legend and that every table has a concise title.  Submit three copies of 
the complete manuscript to the editor.<P>
<P>
<H4>Review and final acceptance:</H4>
All papers shall be reviewed by the editorial board.  When a paper has been finally accepted, it will be 
returned to the author(s), who will be required to get the revised manuscript typed, single spaced, 
according to the instructions, supplied by the editor, for typesetting a paper in final form.  Line illustrations 
must be clearly drawn in India ink on good quality white paper or vellum.  They should be labelled clearly 
in the ink or by typewriter; labels must be large enough to be readable at a 20% reduction after the figure is 
on the page. Either the original drawing or a good quality photographic print of it should be put into place 
in the text.  Photographs should be good quality black-and-white glossies, planned to occupy not more than 
1/2 page; a suggested maximum size is 4" x 4". Proper space should be allowed in the manuscript, with the 
caption typed below; the photo itself should be submitted in a separate envelope, with the figure number 
and top of the photo clearly marked on its back.<P>
<P>
The author(s) are responsible for proofreading and for technical accuracy of the paper.  All final 
typescripts, photographs, and artwork of accepted papers become the property of the publisher.<P>
<P>
<H4>Reprints</H4>
Each author will receive a complete copy of the issue in which his/her paper appears, up to a total of 3 
copies.  The corresponding author is responsible for distribution of copies to coauthors. Reprints may be 
purchased from the publisher.  A reprint order form is supplied when the paper is returned for final typing; 
if you want to order reprints return the form to the editor with the final typescript.<P>

Whole-body, regional or local treatment; practical considerations in therapy: assessment of clinical 
response; controlled trials: physiological effects, short and long-term toxicity. heat treatment in 
combination with other modalities; and optimization of treatment. <P>
<H4>Biological Studies:</H4>
Mechanisms of thermal injury: thermotolerance; modification of thermal response; combinations of heat 
and ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents; effects on normal and malignant cells and organized 
tissues: vascular effects and definition of effective thermal dose.<P>
<H4>Techniques of heat delivery and temperature 
measurement:</H4>
Methods of producing whole-body, regional and local hyperthermia; modelling of heat distributions 
performance and evaluation of equipment; safety and protection; thermal dosimetry: invasive and non-
invasive thermometry: calibration; and data acquisition and system control.<P>

The <I>Journal of Constructivist Psychology</I> provides reports of empirical research, conceptual 
analyses, critical reviews, and occasional case studies pertaining to personal construct theory and related 
constructivist approaches to psychology and the social sciences.  Among the topics suitable for inclusion in 
the journal are studies of psychotherapy and psychopathology, interpersonal relationships, social-cognitive 
processes and development, and applications of the theory to educational, organizational, or business 
settings.  Methodological reports of repertory grid technique are also suitable, as are investigations 
concerning over methods of assessment and research.  The journal seeks to foster constructive interchange 
between personal construct theory and other relevant specialties in the social sciences.  For this reason, 
articles that integrate aspects of personal construct theory with other research traditions are especially 
welcome.<P>

<I>Sociological Spectrum</I> is a refereed interdisciplinary social science journal that publishes 
theoretical, methodological, quantitative and qualitative substantive research, and applied research articles 
in the areas of sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and political science.  Generally, it does not 
publish book reviews or comments.<P>
<P>
Submission of a manuscript to this journal is understood to imply that it or substantial parts of it have not 
been published or accepted for publication elsewhere and that it is not under consideration for publication 
elsewhere.<P>
<P>
<H4>Submission of manuscripts.</H4>
Original and three copies of the manuscripts should be submitted to one of the editors.  All accepted 
manuscripts, artwork, and photographs become the property of the publisher.  With the manuscript please 
include a $10.00 fee payable to the Mid-South Sociological Association to help defray processing costs.  
Receipt of manuscript will be acknowledged only if self-addressed, stamped postcard is included.<P>
<P>
<H4>Transfer of copyright.</H4>
Authors are responsible for obtaining permission to reproduce copy-righted material from other sources 
and are required to sign an agreement for the transfer of copyright to the publisher.  This form will be 
provided by the editors.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Manuscripts.</H4>
All manuscripts must be typed double-spaced on 8 1/2 x 11" papers with 1" to 1 1/2" margins all around.  
Manuscripts that do not conform to these requirements will be returned to the authors for correction and 
thus be delayed in publication.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations.</H4>
Four-colour illustrations will be considered for publication; however, the author will be required to bear the 
full cost involved in their printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,200.  Subsequent 
figures, totalling no more than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each.  Good quality colour prints should be 
provided, in their final size.  Figures needing reduction or enlargement will be charged an additional 25 
percent.  The publisher has the right to refuse publication of colour prints deemed unacceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>1   References.</H4>
Should be listed on separate pages following the text, typed double-spaced, and  should refer only to 
material cited in the manuscript.  They should be listed in alphabetical order and otherwise follow the 
current American Sociological Review style.  In text, reference citations should include author, year of 
publication, and, where needed, page numbers (Brown 1978, p. 54).  Identify subsequent citations of the 
source in the same way as the first, not using ibid., op. cit., or loc. cit. Give both last names for dual 
authors; for more than two use "et al." in the text.  When two authors have the same last name, use 
identifying initials in the text.  For institutional authorship, supply minimum identification from the 
beginning of the complete citation (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1963, p. 117).<P>
<P>
The reference list must be complete and include all references in the text.  The use of "et al." is not 
acceptable in the reference list; provide the names of all authors.  If there is more than one reference to the 
same author and year, distinguish them by the letters a, b, etc. added to the year (Levy 1963a, p. 12).  The 
first letter of each word in an article title should be capitalized.  Titles of books and journals will be printed 
in italics, so each word of the title should be underlined.  Give the publisher's name in as brief a form as is 
fully intelligible.  For example, John A. Wiley &amp  Sons should be Wiley.  If the cited material is 
unpublished, use -Forthcoming- with the name of journal or publisher.  Otherwise use "Unpublished".<P>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>Notes for Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>1. Content</H4>
Authors are responsible for the opinions expressed.  Papers are published on the understanding that they 
have not been published before and are not concurrently under offer to any other journal.<P>
<P>
<H4>2. Organization of manuscripts</H4>
Papers should not exceed 15,000 words in length, typed throughout in double or 1 1/2 spacing.  The title 
page should bear the title of the paper, and name and full address of the author, followed by a summary of 
the paper in about ten lines.  Unless it is very short, the paper should be organized into numbered sections 
(and, if necessary, sub-sections).  The publishers will insert page numbers at the page proof stage.  Authors 
are responsible for the preparation of any artwork and photographs.<P>
<P>
<H4>3. Languages</H4>
The languages of the journal are English, American, French and German, but other languages may be 
accepted in exceptional circumstances.  Papers in foreign languages must contain an English translation of 
the summary.  Previously unpublished manuscripts should appear in their original languages (with a 
translation, if felt necessary), but extracts from published works must be translated into the language of the 
paper.<P>
<P>
<H4>4. Quotations</H4>
Extended quotations should be inset and without quotation marks.  Shorter quotations in the text should be 
enclosed in single quotation marks.<P>
<P>
<H4>5. Footnotes and references</H4>
Footnotes should be numbered consecutively, with superscript numerals placed outside punctuation, thus ... 
Frege disagreed.28  Books should be cited in a style such as: This nameless tome (4 vols., 1981, New 
York), vol. 3, 499.  Papers from journals should be cited as follows:  Barbara O. Celarent, 'Anyone who 
takes an IQ test must be crazy', J. irrat. logic, (4) 89 (1907), 393-398.  Complete page references for a 
paper should always be given, with the specification to particular pages made thereafter.<P>
Cross-references in footnotes to works already cited, or to points made in previous footnotes or their text, 
should be made by footnote number, for example: 'J.  Smith (footnote 11), 223, or as indicated in footnote 
14 . . .' Cross-references in the text should be to section or sub-section numbers.<P>
For papers of relatively small and/or simple bibliographical content-for example, for papers of 
philosophical rather than historical character-sources can be cited in the text.  The form to be used, is, for 
example,'see Lewis 1968,371-373'.The full bibliographical details should be given at the end of the article, 
using the conventions described in the previous paragraph.<P>
<P>
<H4>6. Copyright</H4>
Authors are responsible for securing written permission to reproduce any text, tables or illustrations from 
other sources which they wish to include in their papers.  Authors of papers accepted for publication must 
assign the copyrights in them to Taylor &amp  Francis Ltd.<P>
<P>
<H4>7. Submission</H4>
Authors should submit two copies of their papers to the most appropriate board member. Rejected 
manuscripts will not be returned.<P>
<P>
<H4>8. Publication</H4>
If the paper is accepted, authors will receive a set of galley proofs, together with a form quoting prices for 
extra offprints beyond the fifty that they receive gratis.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Instructions for Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Submission</H4>
Contributions, which may be in the form of reviews, original papers, case studies, programme 
developments or letters to the Editors, should be sent to Henry Fl.  Stonnington (Medical Director, 
Rehabilitation Center of Memorial Medical Center, Provident Office Building, 4750 Waters Avenue, Suite 
307, Savannah, GA 31404, USA), Nathan Cope (Paradigm Health Corporation, 1001 Galaxy Way, Suite 
400, Concord, California 94520, USA), William. W. McKinlay, (Case Management Services Lid, 17a 
Main Street, Balerno, Edinburgh EH14 7EQ, UK) or to one of the regional editors listed on the inside front 
cover.<P>
Two complete copies should be submitted, typed double-spaced on standard 81 X 1 1 in paper with ample 
margins.  Manuscripts are accepted on the understanding that they are not already under consideration for 
publication by another journal.<P>
<P>
<H4>Style and presentation</H4>
Manuscripts should be in English, typed or printed out, double-spaced, on A4 or 81 X 1 1 in paper, and the 
pages numbered.  Pages should include a separate tide page with a clear, specific, but brief tide and a 
suggestion for a shortened title (40 characters or less) for running heads should be included.  The names 
and present affiliations of each author should be given.  One author should be designated as the 
corresponding author to whom proofs and offprint requests should be addressed, and a full correspondence 
address, including telephone and fax numbers, given as a footnote.<P>
All papers must have an abstract, not exceeding 200 words, and including a statement of purpose, methods 
used, results obtained and conclusions reached.  No keywords are necessary.<P>
The text should be divided into sections; original papers should use headings in the order: Introductory 
paragraph(s), Methods, Results, Discussion.  All terms to be abbreviated should be spelled out at first 
mention with the abbreviation following immediately in parentheses.  Avoid obscure abbreviation, slang, 
jargon, and other usage that decreases clarity.  CITE REFERENCES CONSECUTIVELY BY NUMBER.  
ALL references must be cited in the text.  Personal communications and unpublished data should be placed 
in parentheses in the text, not in the list of references.  Also cite each figure and table in the text and 
indicate clearly where these are to be positioned. Use Arabic numbers for both figures and tables.<P>
<P>
<H4>Tables</H4>
Tables should be cited in the text.  Each table should be given a number and a brief informative tide and 
should appear on a separate page.  Omit vertical rules and use extra space to delineate sections of a table.  
Explain in footnotes all abbreviations used in the table. For footnotes, use the following symbols in this 
sequence,  and then double symbols as necessary.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations</H4>
Use only those illustrations that clarify and augment the text.  Authors are asked to provide glossy prints or 
good photocopies; computer printouts should be re-drawn wherever possible.  Each figure should have a 
label pasted on its back indicating the figure number and the top of the figure.  Legends should be on a 
separate sheet.  Specific permission for facial photographs of patients is required.  A letter of consent must 
accompany the photographs of patients in which a possibility of identification exists.  It is not sufficient to 
cover the eyes to mask identity.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
References must be cited in the text CONSECUTIVELY BY NUMBER, and listed at the end of the paper 
in the following styles (provide all authors' names for three or fewer; when there are more than three, add 
'et al.'):<P>
1. BROOKS , N., McKINLAY, W., SYMINGTON, et al.: Return to work within the first seven years of 
severe head injury.  Brain Injury, 1: 5-19, 1987.<P>
<B>for a book:</B><P><B>
</B>2. RIMEL, R. W. and JANE, J. A.: Characteristics of the head-injured patients.  In: M. Rosenthal, E. 
R. Griffith, M. R. Bond and J. D. Miller (editors) Rehabilitation of the Head Adult (F.  A. Davis Company, 
Philadelphia), pp. 9-21, 1983.<P>
<P>
<H4>Guidelines for animal and human research</H4>
When experimental animals are used, state the species, strain, number used, and other pertinent descriptive 
characteristics.  For human subjects or patients, describe their characteristics.  When describing surgical 
procedures on animals, identify the pre anaesthetic and anaesthetic agents used and state the amount of 
concentration and the route and frequency of administration for each.  The use of paralytic agents, such as 
curate or succinylcholine, is not an acceptable substitute for anaesthetics.  For other invasive procedures on 
animals, report the analgesic or tranquilizing drugs used; if none were used, provide justification for such 
exclusion.  When reporting studies on unanaesthetized animals or on humans, indicate that the procedures 
followed were in accordance with institutional guidelines.<P>
<P>
<H4>Proofs</H4>
Proofs are sent to the principal author who must return them to the Publisher within 3 days of receipt.  
Printers' errors may be corrected but any changes from the original manuscript will be charged to the 
author(s).<P>
<P>
<H4>Offprints</H4>
Fifty (50) offprints will be sent to the principal author of each paper.  An order form for additional 
offprints will accompany the proofs.  There are no page charges in 'Brain Injury'.<P>

<TITLE>NOTES FOR AUTHORS</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NOTES FOR AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Recent interdisciplinary work has established the study of the encounters, dialogues and mutual 
collaboration (or hostility) between verbal and visual languages as one of the prime new areas of 
humanistic criticism.  The journal will consider for publication articles on all aspects of the diverse 
relationships between words and images, drawing upon literary criticism, art history, semiotics, linguistics, 
anthropology, philosophy, psychology, and socio-cultural history.<P>
<P>
The original and one copy of each manuscript should be submitted to the senior editor, John Dixon Hunt, 
the associate editor, Michael Leslie, or to any member of the editorial committee.  Articles will only be 
accepted for publication provided they have been submitted exclusively to <I>WORD &amp  
IMAGE</I>.<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscripts</H4>
should be typed in double spacing with wide margins on one side of the paper only. contributors should 
follow the MLA Style Sheet (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1975) in preparing 
their manuscripts.  <B>Any reference</B> to published material, or an explanatory note on the text, 
should be cited by superior numeral in the text; notes and references should appear separately at the end.  
<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
should be given as follows:<P>
<H4>To a book</H4>
Floyd Merrill, Semiotic Foundations (Bloomington, I983).<P>
<H4>To a journal</H4>
Judith Wechsler, 'Caricature, newspapers and politics: Paris in the 1830s', Studies in Visual 
Communication, 7 (1981), pp. 20-80.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations</H4>
(photographs, drawings and line diagrams) should be clearly numbered on the reverse in a single sequence, 
and designated 'figures'.  They must be submitted in a form suitable for publication without redrawing: 
drawings should be in ink on good quality paper; photographs should be glossy prints.  Captions should be 
typed separately, and dimensions, medium and location of items should be given where appropriate.<P>
<P>
Manuscripts that do not conform to this style and format will be returned to the contributor for 
revision.<P>
<P>
Whilst every possible care will be taken of illustrations, neither the editor nor the publisher takes 
responsibility for loss or damage: authors should insure appropriately.<P>
<P>
<H4>Proofs</H4>
will be sent to authors to check for typographic mistakes or errors in fact; no part of the article may be 
rewritten on proof.  All changes and addenda submitted by the author will be incorporated at the discretion 
of the editor.  The corrected proofs should be returned to the editor within two days of receipt.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Entrepreneurship &amp  Regional 
Development</H3>
<H3>Instructions to Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Economic growth and continuing prosperity are regional or local phenomena rather than national.  They 
are highly dependent on entrepreneurial vitality and creation of new enterprise by entrepreneurs. Increasing 
recognition of the key role of the entrepreneur combined with the pressures of recession, structural change 
and competitiveness has had multiple effects. Not only has the volume of research in these fields grown but 
there is a trend to convergence of previously fragmented fields.  Regional and local programmes to support 
entrepreneurs and new enterprise foundation are of a bewildering variety, and entrepreneurship is now a 
component of most management and many other education and training curricula.  Large corporations are 
also active in the search for ways to optimize local external and internal entrepreneurship to enhance their 
own competitiveness.<P>
<P>
<I>Entrepreneurship &amp  Regional Development</I> is a journal designed to meet the need for a 
single forum at an international level for this convergence of academic, policy and management interests. 
Topics include: networking, information and communication; the role of universities, innovation centres, 
science parks and other initiatives; characteristics of regions or urban centres which promote innovation 
and the foundation of new enterprises; the interdependence of large corporations and local entrepreneurs; 
factors in the creation of new technology enterprise; transsectoral innovation and entrepreneurship in 
traditional industries; regional culture, economic prosperity and international competitiveness; local 
enterprise initiatives, co-operatives and other forms of social entrepreneurship and innovation; regional 
science and technology policy and programmes; and financing of new enterprises, the role of local venture 
capital and banks.<P>

<H4>AIMS AND SCOPE OF EXPERIMENTAL LUNG 
RESEARCH</H4>
The journal publishes original studies in the major fields of experimental lung research.  Emphasis is 
placed on investigations concerned with mechanisms of pulmonary biology and pathobiology conducted at 
the biochemical, subcellular, cellular, and tissue level.  The journal also publishes reports of important 
methodological advances.  Occasionally, qualified individuals are invited to review research topics of 
special importance or timeliness.<P>
<P>
<H4>The Manuscript</H4>
Manuscripts may be sent to the Editor-in-Chief: Paul Nettesheim, NIEHS, P.O. Box 12233, Research 
Triangle Park, NC 27709, U.S.A. Manuscripts are accepted with the understanding that they are original 
work and are not being submitted for publication elsewhere.  Submit in triplicate, in English, typed double 
spaced on one side of the paper only, and divided into the following sections: Title Page, Abstract (not 
more than 200 words), Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References, Acknowledgements, 
Tables and Figures, and Figure Legends.  The title page should include the names and affiliations of the 
authors, the complete address and telephone or telex number of the corresponding author, and an 
abbreviated title of not more than 45 characters and spaces.  Keywords should be given on the abstract 
page.  Footnotes in the text should be defined on the page they appear and numbered consecutively, with 
superscript arabic numerals.  Identify any mathematical variables that may be confused with numbers, e.g., 
lowercase L and the numeral 1.<P>
<P>
<H4>Tables</H4>
Each table should be typed double spaced on a separate page and numbered with arabic numerals in order 
of reference in the text.  Use only horizontal rules.  Table titles should be brief, with detailed information 
appearing as footnotes and identified in the table by superscript letters.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations</H4>
Submit one set of original figures and three sets of photocopies.  In the case of photomicrographs, please 
submit three sets of originals.  Type legends double spaced on a separate page.  Letters, arrows, and 
symbols used in the figures should be identified in the legend and not on the figure itself.  Label each 
figure on the back with a paste-cm label (do not write directly on it) indicating the number of the figure, 
the corresponding author's name, and the top of the figure.  Do not mount figures or attach them with paper 
clips; enclosing them in an envelope or between paper will suffice.  Handdrawn artwork and photocopies 
are not acceptable as originals.  For line artwork, the originals must be black-ink drawings of professional 
quality or glossy photographs.  Simple line drawings will be reduced to fit within a space of approximately 
5 X 3 in. (13 X 71/2 cm).  Since photographs will be reduced if they exceed the above dimensions (except 
full-page plates), care should be taken either to submit correctly sized photographs or to ensure that the 
reduction will not decrease density.  Four-color illustrations will be considered for publication; however, 
the author will be required to bear the full cost involved in their printing and publication.  The charge for 
the first figure is $ 1,200.  Subsequent figures, totalling no more than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each.  Good 
quality color prints should be provided, in their final size.  Figures needing reduction or enlargement will 
be charged an additional 25 percent.  The publisher has the right to refuse publication of color prints 
deemed unacceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
Identify references in the text by arabic numerals in brackets, and number consecutively in the Reference 
Section in order of their first mention.  References should include:  names of all contributing authors (last 
names first); title of article; title of journal (abbreviate according to the style of Index Medicus) or book; 
volume number; location and name of publishing company (books only); inclusive pages; year of 
publication.  Examples:  journal.  Freund PA: Ethical problems in human experimentation.  N Engl J Med.

The journal proposes to maintain and strengthen the multi-disciplinary approach to garden history that has 
characterised the early stages of a relatively new subject.  While a main emphasis of the journal will be on 
documentation of individual gardens in all parts of the world, articles on other relevant topics -
iconography, aesthetics, botany and horticulture, technology, social and economic history, conservation 
and restoration of historic gardens, geography, history of ideas-will always be considered for 
publication.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Articles</H4>
(two copies) should be submitted to the Editor.  Articles are accepted for publication on the condition that 
they have been submitted only to journal of Garden History. All articles should be typed in double spacing 
with ample margins, on one side of the paper only.  The Editor is also prepared to receive suggestions for 
or synopses of proposed articles.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Contributors</H4>
should follow The M LA Style Sheet, 2nd corrected edn (New York: Modem Language Association of 
America, 1975), in preparing their manuscripts.  References should be typed in double spacing and placed 
after the main text.  They should be as follows:<BR>

appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Illustrations (photographs, drawings and line 
diagrams)</H4>
should be clearly numbered on the back in a single sequence.  Illustrations should not be inserted in the text 
although the author may wish to indicate where he would like them to appear.  A good glossy print of 
photographs should be supplied.  Photographs can be returned to the author.  Reproduction fees may be 
reimbursed to authors, by special prior arrangement with the editor.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Proofs.</H4>
Authors will receive proofs for checking, which should be returned to the Editor as quickly as possible. 
The cost of any alterations other than the correction of printers' errors will be charged to the authors.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ISSUES IN COMPREHENSIVE PEDIATRIC NURSING (CPN) is a refereed journal, published quarterly, 
which is designed to contribute to the literature now available to practitioners, researchers, educators, 
administrators, and students in nursing and other related health disciplines. Both increased specialization 
and certification within the nursing profession have made it imperative to periodically update the 
knowledge base of its members.  Fragmentation of health care has made interdisciplinarity an imperative 
directive.  Therefore, this journal is devoted to examining the specific needs of children and their families 
as identified by nurses and other health care providers through the framework of state-of-the-art 
interventions, theory, research, dissemination, and related organizational and management concepts.  Nurse 
authors as well as co-authors representing health-related disciplines are invited to submit manuscripts.<P>
<P>
<H4>SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS</H4>
Only unpublished work is invited for submission.  Manuscripts are accepted for blind review only if 
accompanied by an author-signed copy of the copyright release form, included in selected issues of CPN or 
available from the Editor.  If the manuscript is a research report involving human subjects, it must contain 
a statement indicating that informed consent was obtained.  Authors are responsible for obtaining 
permission to reproduce copyrighted material from other sources and are required to sign an agreement for 
the transfer of copyright to the publisher.  All accepted manuscripts, artwork, and photographs become the 
property of the publisher.  Submission of a manuscript to this journal is understood to imply that it or 
substantial parts of it have not been published or accepted for publication elsewhere and that it is not under 
consideration for publication elsewhere. All manuscripts, submitted or invited, are sent to two reviewers at 
the same time.  Authors are notified about the decision to publish within six to eight weeks of receipt of a 
completed manuscript.<P>
Send the original manuscript and two copies to the Editor: Chandice Covington, Ph.D., R.N., Wayne State 
University, College of Nursing, Suite 244, 5557 Cass Avenue, Detroit, MI 48202. Phone (313) 577-
4113.<P>
<P>
<H4>PREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</H4>
Manuscripts must be submitted in the style and format described in the Publication Manual of the 
American Psychological Association (4th ed., 1994).  Copies of the manual can be obtained from the 
Publication Department of the American Psychological Association, 750 First Street NE, Washington, DC 
20002-4242; telephone (202) 336-5500.  Authors should review this manual when preparing all aspects of 
their manuscripts.  Manuscripts that do not correspond to these requirement will be returned to the authors 
for correction and thus be delayed in publication.<P>
The manuscript must be typewritten, double-spaced, with 11/2` margins all around.  Typically, manuscripts 
should range in length from 14-16 pages.  Manuscripts must be accompanied by a title page and an abstract 
not to exceed 250 words.  Refer to the manual for specifications regarding the title page, running beads, 
short title, page numbering, abstract, tables/figures, and references.<P>
<P>

<TITLE>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<I>Ultrastructural Pathology</I> is devoted to the prompt publication of papers on diagnostic electron 
microscopy, where the word diagnostic is used in its broadest sense.<P>
<P>
Main emphasis is on the use of electron microscopy in the study of human disease.  Manuscripts 
correlating ultrastructural data with light microscopy, histochemistry, bio-chemistry, cell and tissue 
culturing, electron probe X-ray analysis, and other techniques will be encouraged.  Papers on experimental 
animals will be considered only if they contain ultrastructural information of at least potential importance 
to diagnosis in humans.  Papers on normal human ultrastructure will occasionally be published as a basis 
for the study of disease.  Original research papers, case histories, papers on instrumentation and techniques, 
brief reports, "a case for the panel" (submitted electron micrographs with unknown structures, to be 
commented on by members of the editorial or consulting board), "intriguing cases," and letters to the editor 
are welcome.<P>
<P>
<I>Ultrastructural Pathology</I> also contains solicited review articles, book reviews, and 
announcements of conferences, appointments, new equipment, etc.  Larger contributions may be published 
as supplements, subject to normal reviewing procedures.<P>
<P>
A paper is received with the understanding that it is submitted solely to <I>Ultrastructural Pathology</I> 
and that no great portion of it has been, or is being, published elsewhere.  If in doubt, enclose a copy of the 
former publication (or the paper as submitted to the other publication).  All accepted manuscripts, artwork, 
and photographs become the publisher's property.<P>
<P>
<H4>MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION.</H4>
Send the original typewritten manuscript and one photocopy with two sets of illustrations and a cover letter 
to Jan Vincents Johannessen, MD, PhD, Bruce Mackay, MD, PhD, Jahn M. Nesland, MD, PhD, or Douglas 
W. Henderson, MB, BS, RCPath.  Enclose a self-addressed postcard for the editor to return as 
acknowledgement of manuscript receipt.<P>
<P>
<H4>Copyright Release.</H4>
Transfer of copyright from author to publisher must be clearly stated in writing to enable the publisher to 
assure maximum dissemination of the author's work.  The signed '"transfer of Copyright Agreement" must 
be received before the publisher begins work on a paper.  Submission of this signed form with the paper 
will greatly facilitate its early publication.  The signed '"transfer of Copyright Agreement" also 
acknowledges that the author recognises full responsibility for obtaining permission to reproduce 
copyrighted material from other sources. (Please note that the copyright transfer is effective only if the 
paper is accepted for publication in the journal.)<P>
<P>
<H4>MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION.</H4>
Type all manuscript pages (including tables, figure legends, and references) double-spaced and on only one 
side of letter-sized white bond paper.  Allow margins of 4 cm (1-1/2") left and 2.5 cm (1") top, right, and 
bottom.<P>
<P>
<H4>Title Page.</H4>
Include the following: full title of the paper; all authors' names with highest academic degree and full 
affiliation; an abbreviated paper title (maximum of 40 characters) to be used as running head; 
acknowledgements; name, address, telephone number, and fax number of person who will handle 
correspondence, page proofs, and requests for reprints.<P>
<P>
<H4>Abstract.</H4>
The second page of the paper should include the abstract (maximum of 200 words) followed by a list of up 
to six keywords for coding and indexing.<P>
<P>
<H4>Text.</H4>
Make short and concise; include a brief introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion, summary, 
references, tables, figures, and figure legends.<P>
<P>
<H4>Reference.</H4>
Follow the American Medical Association Manual of Style, Eighth Edition for reference style.  Number in   
the order cited; place Arabic numeral within brackets for text citation.  Papers "in press" may be included 
in the reference list; results "to be published" or received by "personal communication" should appear 
within parentheses in the text.  Journal titles should be abbreviated as in Index Medius.  Reference

<P>
<H4>Figures.</H4>
Number consecutively with single Arabic numerals; briefly and descriptively caption each figure and refer 
to it in the text.  Include a scale bar on the prints, and indicate the length of the scale bar in the caption.  
Original magnification may also be noted in the caption.  Type captions double-spaced on a list separate 
from the figures.<P>
<P>
<H4>Photographs.</H4>
All photographs must fit the format of the journal without reduction.  They should be either a single 
column [8.5 cm (3-1/4")] or a full page [17.9 cm (7")] in width and no more than a full page [23.5 cm (9-
1/4")] in-depth.  Photos that are wider than a singe column yet narrower than a full page are unacceptable 
and will be returned to the author or cropped by the publisher.  All photographs must be glossy and have 
good contrast.  Figure number, author's name, and indication of top should be written on the back with a 
soft pencil.  Preferred mounting may be shown on a separate drawing.  Lettering and arrows should be on

<P>
<H4>Line illustrations.</H4>
They should be professionally made, with maximum contrast and sharp, even lettering; if they are not, they 
will be remade by the publisher at the author's expense.<P>
<P>
Four-colour illustrations will be considered for publication; however, the author will be required to bear the 
full cost involved in their printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,500.  Subsequent 
figures, totalling no more than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each.  Good quality colour prints should be 
provided, in their final size.  Figures needing reduction or enlargement will be charged an additional 25 
percent.  The publisher has the right to refuse publication of colour prints deemed unacceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>Letters to the Editor.</H4>
Letters should be prepared as manuscripts (typed double-spaced). Accompanying figures should be limited 
to the single column width (8.5 cm); figures must have legends and be prepared according to the rules 
above.<P>
<P>
<H4>Spelling.</H4>
Follow Merrriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition.<P>
<P>
<H4>Page Charges.</H4>
Part of the publication cost is covered by a page charge of $43.50 per printed page.  If these charges are 
paid, the author will receive 50 reprints of the article. The acceptance and publication of papers are not 
dependent on the payment of these charges.<P>
<P>
<H4>PROOFS AND AUTHORS' ALTERATIONS.</H4>
Page proofs are sent to the designated author.  They must be carefully checked and returned within 48 
hours of receipt in order to avoid publication delay.  Only minor corrections against the manuscript can be 
allowed without charge.<P>
<P>
<H4>REPRINTS.</H4>
Reprints of an individual article may be ordered from Taylor &amp  Francis.  Use the reprint order form 
included with page proofs.<P>

<CENTER><H3>Instructions to authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Journal's policy is to attract as broad a range of contributions as possible.  These are essentially of two 
types:<P>
(a) academic papers relating to stress, health and safety, and associated areas (empirical reports. reviews, 
case studies, and theoretical papers);<P>
(b) scholarly articles of concern to the policy-makers, managers and trades unionists who have to deal with 
such issues.<P>
<P>
Papers should be of interest to ergonomists, human factors engineers, occupational health specialists, 
industrial sociologists, occupational physicians, medical sociologists, industrial epidemiologists, work 
psychologists, industrial safety officers, personnel managers, occupational hygienists and trades union 
representatives.<P>
<P>
(1) Full manuscripts, or outlines of proposed articles, should be sent to the Managing Editor, Professor 
Tom Cox, or to Regional Editors*<P>
<P>
(2) Authors must include their full postal address, and, where there is joint authorship of a paper, indicate 
who should be approached for offprints.<P>
<P>
(3) Papers will be refereed anonymously and accepted for publication on the condition that they have been 
submitted to <I>Work &amp  Stress</I> alone.  The Editor's decision is final.<P>
<P>
(4) Four copies of articles, in English, should be sent, typed in double-line spacing on one side of the paper 
only.  The front page should have the title, author(s) name(s), affiliation and address.  The second page 
should have the title, abstract of no more than 200 words, and four or five keywords.  Captions of figures 
and tables should be on separate sheets.<P>
<P>
(5) Diagrams will not be redrawn and should be supplied as clean artwork or computer-generated using a 
good laser printer.  Lettering should be of a high standard and of such a size that it remains clearly legible 
when the diagram is reduced to a width of 110 mm.  Diagrams and drawings should be labelled with the 
figure number and abbreviated title of the article.  The original and three copies of each illustration 
(diagram, graph or photograph) should be sent.<P>
<P>
(6) References in the text should be given as: Haslam (1982); if there are more than two authors then the 
style Smith et al. (1982) should be adopted.  References should be alphabetically listed at the end of the 
paper and arranged as follows:<P>
<P>
For papers<P>
Cox, T. and BROCKLEY, T. 1984, The experiences and effects of stress in teachers, British Educational 
Research journal, 10, 83-87.<P>
For books<P>
McDONALD, N. 1984, Fatigue, Safety and the Truck Driver (Taylor &amp  Francis, London).<P>
(7) Authors should obtain, in writing, permission to reproduce material held in copyright by others and a 
copy of this permission should be submitted with the paper.<P>
<P>
(8) Authors are invited to submit a short autobiography of about 100 words with their paper.<P>
<P>
(9) Authors should make their titles short and attractive, i.e., avoiding such generalizations as 
'Occupational stress in....."<P>
<P>
(10) After acceptance of the paper, authors will be sent proofs for final checking.  A charge will be levied 
for alterations, other than corrections of printer's errors.  Three complimentary copies will be sent to the 
principal author without charge.  Additional copies may be ordered on the form accompanying the proofs.  
There are no page charges in <I>Work &amp  Stress</I>.<P>
<P>
(11) The Editors cannot accept responsibility for damage to or loss of papers submitted to them.<P>

<H4>1. Statement of general policy:</H4>
The aim of this journal is to enhance the theory and practice of qualitative research in education.  QSE 
appears quarterly and publishes research employing a variety of qualitative methods and approaches, 
including (but not limited to) ethnographic observation and interviewing, grounded theory, life history, 
case study, qualitative evaluation, curriculum criticism, ethnomethodology, phenomenology.  A variety of 
qualitative research techniques will be represented in the journal, but all papers should address significant 
educational issues and report naturalistic data that have been systematically collected and analyzed.  
Reviews of research and papers on qualitative research methods also are published.  Papers are invited 
from all regions of the  world. QSE is divided into the following sections:<P>
<B>Qualitative Studies</B> presents research findings from one or more qualitative studies that have a 
direct bearing on education.  Articles are not limited to the study of formal schooling.<P>
<B>Methods and Ethics</B> focuses on methodological issues in qualitative research and will explore 
the ethical issues associated with qualitative methods.  Articles on teaching and learning qualitative 
methods are published periodically.<P>
<B>Documents and Debates</B> examines current educational reports and policies from a qualitative 
perspective.<P>
<B>Qualities of the Qualitative</B> examines the nature, characteristics, and generic requirements of 
qualitative research.<P>
<B>Life's Work, Life History</B> features articles on leading qualitative researchers, examining how an 
individual's biography has affected and informed his/her research and vice versa.<P>
<B>Book Reviews</B> present essays and shorter reviews of new publications on qualitative research.  
Review symposia, consisting of several reflections on one important text, followed by a response from the 
author, will be regularly featured.  Retrospective reviews of classical texts are sometimes featured.<P>
<H4>2. Papers</H4>
written in English, are invited for consideration, provided they have not been published, or are currently 
under consideration, elsewhere.  Papers should be submitted in triplicate to the Executive Editors or one of 
the Regional Editors.<P>

<TITLE>Instructions to Authors</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Instructions to Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Aims and scope</H4>
<I>Molecular Physics</I> publishes reports of an experimental and theoretical nature on the structure and 
properties of atomic and molecular physics.<P>
<P>
<H4>Form</H4>
Articles published in <I>Molecular Physics</I> are of four kinds: Papers, Preliminary Communications, 
Research Notes and Invited Articles.  Papers report completed research of timeliness and importance.  
preliminary Communications describe aspects of current research whose immediate publication is of 
benefit to the scientific community.  These should be brief, no more than a total of four printed pages.  
They will be published as rapidly as possible and so, unlike papers, proofs will not be sent to the authors.  
Invited Articles are critical and concise accounts of topics which are deemed to be of particular 
significance.  The topics as well as the authors will be selected by the editors and members of the Editorial 
Board.<P>
<P>
<H4>Papers and Preliminary Communications</H4>
may be submitted in English, French or German and must be accompanied by an abstract of not more than 
300 or 100 words, respectively; articles in French or German must include a second abstract in 
English.<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscripts</H4>
should be prepared in the style of current issues of the journal and typed in double spacing.  The first page 
should contain the title, a list of authors and their affiliations and a short running title of less than 40 
characters as well as the name and address of the corresponding author.  The second page should contain 
the abstract.  The pages of the manuscript should be numbered.<P>
<P>
<H4>Submission</H4>
Articles intended for publication in Molecular Physics should be sent, in triplicate, to one of the 
editors.<P>
<P>
<H4>Figures</H4>
All figures (photographs, charts, diagrams and graphs) must be submitted as camera-ready art and must 
therefore be drawn to a professional standard.  Either black-ink drawings or good quality A4 (210 x 297 
mm) glossy prints are acceptable.  The lettering should be sufficiently large to withstand reduction.  
Figures should be numbered in order of their appearance in the text. The axis labels of the graph should be 
dimensionless numbers.  For example time/s and frequency/MHz.  Each manuscript copy must include a 
complete set of photocopies of the figures with a set of self-explanatory captions, typed on a separate sheet.  
The original figures should be sent with the manuscript when the paper is submitted. Chemical formulae, 
including ring systems, and diagrammatic representations of integrals should be treated as figures and 
submitted as camera-ready art<P>
<P>
<H4>Colour illustrations</H4>
Figures may be printed in colour within the text of an article, where this is essential to the scientific content 
no charge will be made for the publication of colour plates.  A set of colour prints must accompany each of 
the manuscripts submitted.<P>
<P>
<H4>Tables</H4>
Tables should be numbered in the order in which they are discussed in the text and typed on separate 
sheets; they should not be included in the text.  Each table should have a brief descriptive title.  All data 
should be defined in the column heading, which should be a dimensionless number, i.e. a column of 
temperatures might be headed T/K.<P>
<P>
<H4>Units</H4>
Authors should adhere to international conventions in the choice of symbols, units, notation and 
nomenclature.  Many of these are summarised in IUPAC, Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical 
Chemistry, available from Blackwell Scientific Publications Ltd, Osney Mead, Oxford OX2 OEL, UK.  A 
few non-SI units are acceptable, for example the Angstrom unit (1 A = 0. 1 run).  In general, however, non-
SI units should be avoided but where this is particularly inconvenient the non-SI unit must be defined in 
the manuscript Instructions to Authors<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
References must be numbered consecutively in the text and listed at the end of each manuscript.  
References must be complete and of the form:<P>
<P>
[1] LUZAR, M., THAYER, A., and PINES, A., 1987, Molec.  Phys., 62, 573. for a journal;<P>
[2] ALLEN, M. R, and TILDESLEY, D. L, 1987, The Computer Simulation of Liquids (Oxford: 
Clarendon) p. 57.for a book.<P>
<P>
<H4>British Library Document Supply Centre</H4>
When papers include extensive tabular material or appendices which may be of interest to relatively few 
readers this material should be deposited with the British Library under their Supplementary Publications 
scheme.  Details of these arrangements are given at the end of each issue of the journal.<P>
<P>
<H4>Copyright</H4>
Authors are required to transfer the copyright of their articles to the publishers to protect their rights under 
the 1976 U.S. Copyright Act.  Alternatively, authors may issue a licence to publish.  A transfer form and an 
explanatory note will be sent to authors<P>
<P>
<H4>Proofs</H4>
Proofs of Papers and Invited Articles will be sent directly to the author for correction and must be returned 
to the publisher within 48 hours of receipt.<P>
<P>
<H4>Page charges and offprints</H4>
There are no page charges for the journal and in addition authors are entitled to 50 offprints of their article 
free of charge; further copies, as well as copies of the complete issue, may be ordered at the charges shown 
on the offprint order form which is sent to authors.<P>
<P>
<H4>Publication time</H4>
The editors and publishers act to ensure prompt publication of all accepted work.  To this end, referees can 
now send their reports to the editors using electronic mail and authors can respond on these reports in the 
same way.  The appropriate electronic mail addresses are given below.  Authors can assist the editors by 
conforming to the conventions laid out in these notes.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Notes for Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H5>(fuller notes are available on request from the Editor)</H5>
<P>
<H4>1 .General Policy.</H4>
History of Education publishes original papers, correspondence and reviews of books on the history of 
education whether in formal institutions or in informal situations.  Papers considering education in all parts 
of the world at any point in time will be considered.  Papers are published on the understanding that they 
have not been published before and are not concurrently on offer to any other journal.  History of 
Education appears four times a year in March, June, September and December.<P>
<P>
<H4>2.  Preparation of manuscripts.</H4>
Manuscripts must be typed on good quality paper in double spacing with wide margins.  Footnotes should 
be numbered consecutively and should be typed out separately after the main text.  Diagrams and plates 
should be submitted separately with an indication of the appropriate place for their appearance in the paper.  
Pale photocopies of material for photographic reproduction are not acceptable.<P>
<P>
The normal maximum length for an article is 10000 words including footnotes.  This limit may 
occasionally be exceeded in particular cases but only by arrangement with the Editor.  The title page 
should bear the title of the paper and the name and full address (including telephone/fax/email numbers) of 
the author.  Contributors are asked to remember that the contents of the journal are intended to be readily 
intelligible to the non-specialist as well as the specialist reader.  Technical expressions should be kept to a 
minimum and any that are necessary should be carefully defined.<P>
<P>
<H4>3. Quotations</H4>
Extended quotations should be inset and without quotation marks.  Shorter quotations in the text should be 
enclosed in single quotation marks.<P>
<P>
<H4>4. Footnotes and references.</H4>
Footnotes should be numbered consecutively with superscript numerals placed outside punctuation, thus: ... 
to which Forster agreed.27   Books should be cited in the following style: H. Rashdall (eds F. M. Powicke 
and A. B. Emden), The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, 3 vols (Oxford, 1936), I, 131-8.  Papers 
from journals should be cited thus: E. P. Pride,  'Ecclesiastical legislation in education 300-1200', Church 
History, XII (1943), 235-54.  Citations from manuscripts should give location as well as details of the 
document.<P>
<P>
<H4>5. Copyright.</H4>
Authors alone are responsible for the opinions expressed in their papers and for securing permission to 
reproduce copyright material from other sources where this is necessary.  Taylor &amp  Francis Ltd hold 
the copyright of all material published in <I>History of Education</I>.  See Copyright Information on the 
inside front cover.<P>
<P>
<H4>6. Submission of manuscripts.</H4>
Authors should submit their manuscripts direct to the Editor.  To facilitate the process of refereeing two 
copies of the manuscripts,  including the original, should be submitted.<P>
<P>
<H4>7. Publication.</H4>
If the paper is accepted, the author will receive a set of proofs, together with a form quoting prices for extra 
offprints beyond the 50 which they receive gratis.  Substantial changes in a paper at the proof stage will be 
charged to the author.  Authors may order a copy of the issue in which their paper appears at a special 
discount price.<P>

<TITLE>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS (REVISED 1995)</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS (REVISED 
1995)</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>1. Principal Contents</H4>
The Journal is dedicated to the publication of original scholarly articles about any aspect of Geographical 
Information Systems and related areas.  Manuscripts are encouraged which cover research on 
developments in computer science, cartography, surveying, geography, and engineering, as well as 
applications in all of natural resources, social systems, the built environment, and anywhere else GIS are 
applied.  The Journal will have FIVE main types of communication, although not every issue will carry 
material in all types:<P>
<H4>i. Guest Editorials</H4>
These will be short pieces intended to provoke discussion among the research community.  They will not 
require extensive referencing, and should be up to 1500 words.  Interested are invited to contact the 
editors.<P>
<H4>ii Research articles</H4>
The bulk of the Journal will contain articles describing in full original research furthering the development 
and applications of Geographical Information Systems.<P>
<H4>iii.  Review articles</H4>
In a fast developing area with many strands of work, researchers are hard pressed to keep up in even a few 
aspects.  Review articles are encouraged from researchers who are very active in particular areas so that 
others may have easy access to a compendium of the developments in that area.<P>
<H4>iv. Short, Technical Communications</H4>
Many novel ideas do not bear presentation in normal research articles, but are better presented as short 
direct papers.  This section will carry articles not normally over 2000 words.<P>
<H4>v. Book Reviews</H4>
The Book Review Editor will consider reviews of books bearing any relation to <I>Geographical 
Information Systems</I>.<P>
<P>
<H4>2. Prior Publication</H4>
The Journal will not knowingly publish papers which have appeared elsewhere in the same or substantially 
the same form; papers published in conference proceedings will be considered only if they have been 
substantially modified.<P>
<P>
<H4>3. Refereeing</H4>
All contributions will be submitted to three referees for their opinions.  The names of authors and referees 
will be confidential to the editor as long as the guidelines below are followed.  The decision as to whether 
an article should be included in the Journal is the responsibility of the Editors.<P>
<P>
<H4>4. Form of manuscripts for submission</H4>
FOUR copies of the manuscript written in English should be submitted, typed or word processed in double 
spacing on one side of the paper only.  At present submission is not encouraged by Fax, but so long as 
figures are not included email is possible.  A4 or 8.5 X 11 inch paper is preferred, and the paper must be 
paginated.  The following structure must be observed.<P>
<H4>(a) Title page</H4>
Should contain the TITLE, the NAMES and AFFILIATIONS of all authors, KEYWORDS, a short title for 
the running head (less than 60 characters), and any ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  The name of the author for 
correspondence should be included.  Inclusion of mail address and/or FAX number may hasten processing 
of the manuscript.  If running headers or footers are used through the manuscript the name(s) of the 
author(s) should not appear in them.  This page should be the ONLY place where the name(s) of the 
author(s) and affiliation(s) appear anywhere in the manuscript.<P>
<H4>(b) Abstract page</H4>
The title should be repeated in full at the top of this page, and an abstract of 50-100 words should 
follow.<P>
<H4>(c) Main text</H4>
The main text of the article will then follow, with numbered sections and sub-sections, in the normal style 
of the Journal.<P>
<H4>(d) Equations</H4>
All equations in a paper should be labelled as Equation 1, Equation 2, etc.<P>
<H4>(e) Appendices</H4>
Are not usually encouraged but may be included between the main text and the references.<P>
<H4>(f) References</H4>
Papers need to be referenced to relevant literature to place them in the context of current research.  Authors 
should examine past copies of the Journal to see the general style of referencing.  References should be 
cited in the text as either (Lowell 1991), (DeMers and Fisher 1991) or (Openshaw et al. 1990).  In the final 
section of the paper, all references cited in the paper, and only those cited in the paper, are to be listed in 
alphabetical order of author and chronological order by author (oldest first).  Titles of books and 
periodicals should be given in full, not abbreviated, and both starting and ending page numbers should be 
included.  References to material published on the Internet should give the full Universal Resource Locator 
(URL) Some of the commonly used forms are as follows:<P>
<P>
<H4>Journals:</H4>
EGENHOFER, M. L, and FRANZOSA, R. D., 1991, Point-set topological spatial relations.  International 
Journal of Geographical Information Systems, 5, 161-174.<P>

<H4>Proceedings :</H4>
MILLER, D., 1992, Analysis of vegetation succession within an expert 	system.  	In Proceedings of the 5th 
International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling Columbia: International Geographical Union), pp. 381-
400.<P>
<H4>Reports:</H4>

Research Laboratory, Leicester.<P>
<H4>Electronic media:</H4>
GITTINGS, B., 1995, Digital Elevation Data Catalogue URL http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/ded.html.<P>
<P>
<H4>(g) Tables</H4>
Tables should all be numbered and referred to in the text.  In the final manuscript each able needs to be on 
a separate sheet and accompanied by a caption.  The tables should be arranged with the paper in portrait 
orientation if at all possible.<P>
<P>
<H4>(h) Illustrations</H4>
All illustrations should be referred to in the text, and, whether line drawings, black-and-white or colour 
photographs, they should all be numbered in a single sequence.  Original copies of diagrams and 
illustrations, one per page and clearly numbered, should be supplied, and should be designed so as to be 
suitable for reduction to the journal's page width (125 mm).  The copy of the manuscript containing the 
original diagrams should be clearly marked ORIGINAL.  Special attention should be paid to lettering and 
line work. Photographs may be sent as glossy prints.  Colour illustrations may be used: funds should be 
sought by the authors to support their reproduction, although their availability is not a condition of the 
acceptance of colour illustrations.  Where tables and illustrations are integrated in the text, copies on 
separate sheets are also required.<P>
Authors are encouraged to employ the Internet and the World Wide Web to increase the illustrative 
possibilities for their papers.  Provided the server is stable, many colour illustrations and animations may 
be provided with commentary on the internet.  Such illustrations should be referenced by their URL, so that 
anyone with access to the Internet may view them. Since some readers still lack such access all articles 
must still be free standing, and not require these illustrations to be coherent.  Authors using the Internet for 
illustrations must have agreement from the server administrator that their material will remain available for 
at least 3 years, even if the author changes employment, and assuming that the site maintains a server.<P>
<H4>(i) Footnotes</H4>
Footnotes are to be avoided.  If a point is worth making it should generally be made in the text.  Endnotes 
may exceptionally be admitted.<P>
The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that written permission is obtained from the copyright 
holder for any copyrighted material to be included in the article.  These structural guidelines must be 
followed to assist the composition of the paper for publication. Manuscripts which do not conform to these 
guidelines may be returned to the authors for compliance.<P>
<P>
<H4>5. Units and Symbols</H4>
All measurements must be given in the SI system of units. Non-SI may be added in parenthesis where they 
have significance.<P>
<P>
<H4>6. Proofs and Offprints</H4>
The corresponding author will be sent proofs for checking.  These should be returned promptly and within 
48 hours. 50 offprints of the paper will be sent to this author free of charge.  Additional offprints may be 
ordered on a form which accomplishes the proofs.  There are no page charges.<P>
<P>
<H4>7. Copyright</H4>
All articles are accepted for consideration on the understanding that.<P>
a) they are the original work of the named authors;<P>
(b) the contents is not published elsewhere and neither is it nor will it be submitted for consideration by 
another publisher;<P>
(c) the contents do not substantially repeat work published or submitted elsewhere (e.g. another journal, 
conference proceedings, etc.);<P>
(d) the paper is not available on the internet at the time of submission or thereafter.<P>
<P>
The corresponding author will be asked to transfer copyright in the article to the publishers, or to issue 
them an exclusive licence to publish, if copyright cannot be transferred.  Details will accompany 
proofs.<P>
<P>
<H4>8. Submission</H4>
Corresponding authors whose address lies within the United States and Canada should send their 
manuscripts to the North American Editor.  All others should be sent to the Editor.  Book reviews should 
be sent to the Book Review Editor.  All addresses are given on the title page.<P>
Failure to follow any of these requirements will significantly delay the processing of a manuscript.<P>

<TITLE>NOTES FOR AUTHORS</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NOTES FOR AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The <I>Journal of Medical Engineering &amp  Technology</I> is aimed at a readership drawn from both 
clinical and engineering disciplines.  Authors should bear this in mind when preparing manuscripts, and try 
to ensure that both language and style are appropriate.  All reported work should be put in context by the 
inclusion of a short historical review in the introduction.<P>
<P>
<H4>The Manuscript</H4>
The manuscript should consist of the following parts:<P>
(1) The title page, containing a brief and informative title together with a list of authors, their affiliations 
and full addresses, with telephone and fax numbers.  Particular attention should be paid to the wording of 
the title since this may be the only indication of the scope and nature of the paper when quoted in a citation 
index.<P>
(2) An abstract of about 150 words that should succinctly describe the scope of the contribution and 
highlight significant findings or points of innovation.<P>
(3) The main text.<P>
(4) References: set out according to the guidelines given below.<P>
(5) Tables: each on a separate sheet and accompanied by a caption.<P>
(6) Illustrations: the captions to accompany these should be listed on a separate sheet and should stand 
alone to describe the content of the illustration without recourse to the main body of the text.<P>
<P>
Two copies of the manuscript should be submitted.  It should be typed on A4 paper in double spacing with 
ample margins, on one side of the paper only.  The standard for spelling is that of The Concise Oxford 
Dictionary (Oxford University Press).  Abbreviations should be limited to those in general use; where a 
frequently occurring term is abbreviated, it should in the first instance by written in full, for example 
'electroencephalogram (EEG)'.  SI units and the Celsius scale should be used throughout the manuscript 
and on all figures.  Other units in common use, such as mmHg for physiological pressures, are 
acceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
References should be indicated in the text by numbers following the author's name where this is used, or by 
numbers only where not. i.e. Skeggs [6].  In the reference section they should be arranged as follows:<P>
<H4>to a journal:</H4>
1. FANSHAWE, E. (1981) The importance of rehabilitation to disabled people.  Journal of Medical 
Engineering &amp  Technology, 5, 263-269.<P>
<H4>to a book:</H4>
2. JELSMA, L. F. and McQUEEN, J. D. (1968) Changes in impedance pulsations during Intravenal. 
hypertension.  In J. W. Bain and A. M. Harper (eds) Bloodflow Through Organs and Tissues (Churchill 
Livingstone, London), pp. 328-335.<P>
<P>
Journal titles should be given in full.  Citations such as 'unpublished observations' and 'personal 
communication' should not be included in the reference section but may be added at the appropriate place 
in the text.  Manuscripts accepted for publication should be included in the reference section, in which case 
the title of the journal should be given and the paper described as 'in press'.  References quoting a book or 
conference proceedings must cite the publisher and place of publication.<P>
<P>
<H4>Illustrations</H4>
Line diagrams are preferred to photographs, and original copies of diagrams should be supplied where 
possible.  These should be drawn so that they are suitable for reduction to the page or column width of the 
journal, i.e. to 85 or 179 mm, with special attention to the size of lettering- when reduced to column width 
letters should appear about 4 mm high.  Photographs may be sent as glossy prints or as slides.  Figures 
should be identified with the author's name, figure number and an arrow indicating the top.  Identifications, 
etc. should be typed on a gummed label and attached to the back of the figure.  Any writing on the back of 
the figure itself should be in soft pencil.<P>
<P>
<H4>Proofs</H4>
Proofs are sent to the corresponding author, who should return them within 48 hours of receipt. Printers' 
errors only may be corrected; any other amendments will be charged to the author.<P>
<P>
<H4>Reprints</H4>
Fifty (50) reprints of each article are sent to the corresponding author free of charge.  Additional reprints 
may be purchased by ordering on the form sent with the page proofs.<P>
<P>
<H4>Copyright</H4>
Authors are themselves responsible for obtaining the necessary permission to reproduce copyright material 
from other sources.<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscript submission</H4>
Manuscripts should be sent to the Editor or the appropriate member of the Editorial Committee, c/o the 
Staff Editor, Journal of Medical Engineering &amp  Technology, Taylor &amp  Francis Ltd, 4 John Street, 
London WC1 N 2ET, UK.  Tel: + 44 (0)171 405 2237; Fax: + 44 (0)171 831 2035.<P>

<P>
LEISURE SCIENCES presents scientific inquiries into the study of leisure, recreation, parks, travel, and 
tourism from a social science perspective.  Articles cover the social and psychological aspects of leisure, 
planning for leisure environments, leisure gerontology, travel and tourism behaviour, leisure economics, 
and urban leisure delivery systems.  The journal provides an international forum for leisure research.  The 
interdisciplinary diversity of topics in Leisure Sciences makes it of special interest to academicians, 
consultants, students, bureaucrats, and practitioners involved in research, teaching, planning, management, 
administration, and promotion. <P>
Four copies of each manuscript should be sent to: Daniel R. Williams, Department of Leisure Studies, 104 
Huff Hall, University of Illinois, 1206 S. 4th St., Champaign, IL 61820.<P>
Taylor &amp  Francis will do everything possible to ensure prompt publication, therefore it is required that 
each submitted manuscript be in complete form. Please take the time to check all references, figures, tables, 
and text for errors before submission.<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscript.</H4>
Manuscripts will be accepted with the understanding that their content is unpublished and not being 
submitted for publication elsewhere.  All parts of the manuscript, including the title page, abstract, tables, 
and legends should be typewritten, double-spaced on one side of white bond in English.  Allow margins of 
at least one inch (3 cm) on all sides of the typed pages.  Number manuscript pages consecutively 
throughout the paper.<P>
<P>

<P>
This international journal is devoted to the preparation, properties and uses of small particles individually 
encapsulated to provide protection from their environment, sustained release or an enclosed environment 
for chemical reactions.  Applications are found in pharmaceuticals and medicine, chemistry, agriculture 
and many other areas, and it is an aim of the journal to provide information links between the users of the 
techniques in these diverse industries.<P>
<P>
Contributions, which may be in the form of reviews, papers or short communications, should be sent either 
to the Editor, Dr T. L. Whateley, or to one of the two Regional Editors, Professor Tamotsu Kondo or Dean 
Louis A. Luzzi.<P>
<P>
Papers are accepted on the understanding that they have not been previously published and are not under 
consideration elsewhere.<P>
<P>
<H4>Style and presentation</H4>
Manuscripts should be in English, typed in double spacing on A4 paper.  Pages should be numbered and 
the typescript should be arranged in the following order: title, author(s) and addresses including 
telephone/fax numbers; running title; abstract of not more than 250 words; up to five keywords, text of

of figures.<P>
<P>
<H4>9. Disk submission</H4>
Articles, essay reviews and book reviews will be automatically typeset from disk.  It is important that the 
final copy of your paper is checked carefully because spelling mistakes, inconsistencies and errors will be 
faithfully translated into the typeset copy.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparing the disk</H4>
Please present all sections of the paper in a single file.<P>
- The text should be typed unjustified, without hyphenation (except for compound words) and in double

<P>
<CENTER><H3>INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>SCOPE:</H4>
<I>Issues in Mental Health Nursing</I> is a refereed journal designed to expand the literature on the 
psychosocial and mental health aspects of nursing care currently available to students, educators, and 
practitioners. The journal's main emphasis is on new, innovative approaches to client care, analysis of 
current issues, and nursing research findings.<P>
Because clinical research is the primary vehicle for the development of nursing science, <I>Issues in 
Mental  Health Nursing</I> presents articles that report research findings and lists studies conducted by 
nurses that focus on the caretaking process.  The journal also presents articles that address the application 
of the nursing process to clients and families for the purpose of mental health promotion, prevention of 
psychosocial dysfunction, and the resolution or amelioration of existing problems.<P>
A holistic approach to mental health care emphasizes the need to acknowledge the mutual interaction and 
influence between the client and the environment.  Families, caretakers, the proximate milieu, and society 
are significant influential dimensions of this environment that nurses need to understand.  Articles covering 
current social issues that either directly or indirectly influence the practice of mental health nursing are 
welcome.  Address manuscripts to the Editor, Mary Swanson Crockett, The University of Texas School of 
Nursing, 1700 Red River, Austin, Texas 78701.<P>
Submission of a manuscript to this journal is understood to imply that it or substantial parts of it have not 
been published or accepted for publication elsewhere.<P>
Manuscripts should be typewritten double-spaced throughout, including references, tables, footnotes, and 
figure legends, on 8 1/2 x 11 regular bond paper (not erasable bond).  Submit all manuscripts in triplicate

permission should be acknowledged in the figure legends or table titles.  Figures should also be numbered 
consecutively.  All tables and figures must be referred to in the text.<P>
<P>
<H4>Figures.</H4>
Line illustrations should be professionally made, with maximum contrast and sharp, even lettering.  
Photocopies are unacceptable.  Number consecutively with single Arabic numerals and note in text where 
each should be placed.  Type captions on a separate sheet of paper and place figures and captions following 
tables.  All photographs must be glossy and have good contrast.  Four-colour illustrations will be 
considered for publication: however, the author will be required to bear the full cost involved in their 
printing and publication.  The charge for the first figure is $1,200.  Subsequent figures, totalling no more 
than 4 text pages, are $500.00 each.  Good quality colour prints should be provided, in their final size.  
Figures needing reduction or enlargement will he charged an additional 25 percent.  The publisher has the 
right to refuse publication of colour prints deemed unacceptable.<P>

however, a partially theoretical paper in which theory is compared with new experimental data is 
acceptable.<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscript Submission.</H4>
Three copies of the manuscript (prepared according to the instructions below) should be sent to the 
appropriate editor.  Each manuscript must be accompanied by a statement that it has not been published 
elsewhere and that it has not been simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.  The original 
drawings should be retained by the author.  All accepted manuscripts, artwork, and photographs become 
the property of the publisher.<P>
<P>
<H4>Transfer of Copyright.</H4>
Contributions to <I>Experimental Heat Transfer</I> are accepted only on the understanding that the 
copyright is vested in Taylor &amp  Francis.  All papers accepted for publication must be accompanied by 
a copyright release form signed by the authors.  This form is available from the editors.  Where text, 
figures, photographs, etc., are reproduced from copyrighted material, the author(s) will be required to 
produce written evidence that appropriate permission to make such reproduction has been granted by the 
copyright holder(s).<P>
<P>
<H4>Manuscript Preparation.</H4>
All manuscripts must be prepared in English and typed double-spaced on only one side of the paper with

results, and further work that should be done.<P>
<P>
<H4>Nomenclature.</H4>
A separate nomenclature section at the end of the paper should list in detail the symbols used in the 
manuscript, their definitions, and their units.  The nomenclature list should be in alphabetical order with 
Greek symbols following the alphabetical listing.  Subscripts and superscripts should follow Greek 
symbols and should be identified with a heading.  Units should be included only when necessary for the 
understanding of the textual material.  To indicate units involving fractions, slashes should be used (e.g.,

<P>
The Journal publishes peer-reviewed scientific articles for the advancement of surgery to the ultimate 
benefit of patient care and rehabilitation.  It is the only journal that encompasses the individual and 
collaborate efforts of scientists of multiple professional backgrounds who are engaged in surgical research.  
Such backgrounds include, but are not limited to, all human and veterinary medicine and dentistry 
disciplines and fields, basic and applied sciences and engineering, as well as law and ethics, as long as the 
articles of publication focus on issues of interest to the surgical research community.  The Journal 
publishes original scientific and technical contributions, covering such topics as: the development of novel 
surgical concepts; result and evaluation of surgical methodologies and products, devices, biomaterials, 
pharmacological agents, and drugs; evaluation of biological responses to surgical insults; clinical 
evaluations of novel concepts and devices; critical analyses and reviews of topics and trends in surgical 
research; and ethical and regulatory considerations related to patients and animals participating in surgical 
research.  The Journal fosters multidisciplinary collaboration in the pursuit of surgical research and aims to 
serve as a channel of communication toward this goal. Accepted manuscripts will therefore address a 
multidisciplinary readership.  They will deal exclusively with research whose ultimate goal is to advance 
knowledge and improve technology to the benefit of patient care and rehabilitation.  All reported in vivo

<CENTER><H3>NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<H4>Aims and Scope</H4>
<I>Maritime Policy and Management</I> is an international shipping and port journal providing a 
multidisciplinary forum for the exchange of views, opinions and information through articles, reports, 
reviews and commentaries on relevant operations within the maritime world.  Since several journals deal 
with marine technology, MPM tends to concentrate on business, economic, socio-legal and management 
topics at port, shipping company and shipyard levels.  MPM balances theory with accounts and analyses of 
the problems encountered, and solutions engendered, in the routine of port and shipping management as 
well as disseminating pure research findings.  The intentions and effects of national and international 
legislation on maritime trade are examined and discussed.<P>
<P>
Thus MPM is not limited to academics.  Contributions from practising policy-makers, managers and 
seafarers are welcomed, as are comments on, and criticisms of, matter already published.<P>
<P>
<H4>Submission of Manuscripts</H4>
<H4>Articles.</H4>
In view of the pressure on space, articles should contain fewer than 7000 words, but this figure may be 
exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Short papers are particularly welcome and these should contain 
approximately 2500 words.<P>
<P>
Three copies of each manuscript should be sent to Professor James McConville, Centre for International 
Transport Management, London Guildhall University, 84 Moorgate, London EC2M 6SQ, U.K, but may 
also be submitted through any member of the editorial advisory panel.  Only original articles normally in 
English will be accepted.  Copyright is vested in the publishers, and authors are responsible for obtaining 
permission to include any other copyright material.  All articles are subject to blind refereeing.<P>
<P>
<H4>Comment column.</H4>
This column will normally be used for an exchange of views on published articles and should not exceed 
1000 words.  To ensure topicallity, contributions should be submitted as soon as possible after publication 
of the item being commented upon to facilitate inclusion in the following issue.  Manuscripts for this 
column should comply with the format guidelines set out below, but they will not be subject to blind 
refereeing.<P>
<P>
<H4>Typing Format</H4>
Manuscripts should be typed double-spaced on A4 paper with wide margins. An abstract of approximately 
150 words should be provided. Author's names and institutions should only appear on a separate page in 
order to ensure blind refereeing.  Notes and references should appear at the end.  Illustrations photographs, 
diagrams and graphs should appear on consecutively numbered sheets, with the captions explaining their 
content typed separately; a similar procedure should be followed if tables are included in the paper.  
Bibliographical references should be numbered consecutively in the text and appear at the end of the article 
as follows.  Examples of the style for one book and one journal reference are given.<P>
<P>

<P>
<H4>Proofs and Offprints</H4>
Correspondence and proofs for correction will be sent to the first named author.  Fifty (50) offprints will be 
sent without charge; an order form for larger numbers will accompany the proofs.<P>
<P>
<H4>Books for Review</H4>
Books for review, and related correspondence, should be sent to Barbara Fletcher FICS, Director, Institute

<P>
<H4>Aims and Scope</H4>
<I>Liquid Crystals</I> publishes reports of original research on science and technology of liquid crystals 
including synthesis of new materials, physical studies and device applications.  The growth of research 
activity in the liquid crystals field and the recognition of the journal as one of high standards and quality 
has resulted in recent times in more manuscript submissions than can be published within the allocated 
page limit required to maintain a reasonable annual subscription rate.  As a result, scrutiny by referees will 
be more critical and acceptance given only to submissions of quality which clearly represent significant 
advances in the fundamental understanding and the applied science of liquid crystals.  The editors therefore 
reserve the right to reject papers which do not measure up to the above standards.<P>
<P>
The reports published are of three kinds: Papers, Preliminary Communications and Invited Articles.<P>
(a) Papers describe completed research of timeliness and importance.<P>
(b) Preliminary Communications report results whose immediate availability to the scientific community is 
likely to be beneficial to the discipline.  These should be brief, no more than a total of two printed pages 
(about five manuscript pages), including figures and tables.  They will be published as rapidly as possible 
and so, unlike Papers, proofs will not be sent to the authors.<P>
(c) Invited Articles are critical and concise accounts of topics which are deemed to be of particular 
significance.  The topics as well as the authors will be selected by the editors and members of the editorial 
board.<P>
<P>
<H4>Submission and Manuscripts.</H4>
Three copies of articles intended for publication in <I>Liquid Crystals</I> should be sent to one of the 
editors.  They must be accompanied by a letter requesting publication signed by one of the authors. 
Authors in Africa, the Americas, India and the Far East should send their papers to Professor N.A. Clark; 
all other authors should submit their work to Professor G.W. Gray.  In order to proceed to review, 
manuscripts must conform to the following standards.<P>
<P>
<H4>Text.</H4>
Manuscripts submitted for publication must be in grammatically sound and clear scientific English, French 
or German and must be accompanied by an abstract of not more than 100 words; articles in French or 
German must include a second abstract in English. Manuscripts should be prepared in the style of current 
issues of the journal and typed in double spacing.  If not, manuscripts may be sent back to the author for 
retyping.  The first page should contain the title, a list of authors and their affiliations and a short running 
title of less than 40 characters as well as the name and address of the corresponding author.  The second 
page should contain the abstract.  The pages should be numbered consecutively.<P>
<P>
<H4>Figures</H4>
All figures (photographs, charts diagrams and graphs) must be submitted as camera-ready artwork and 
must therefore be drawn to a professional standard.  Either black-ink drawings or good quality A4 (210 x 
297 mm) glossy prints are acceptable.  The lettering should be sufficiently large to withstand reduction.  
Figures should be numbered according to the sequence of their appearance in the text.  The axis labels for 
graphs must be pure numbers, such as the quotient of the symbol for the physical quantity and the symbol 
for the unit used.  For example, a plot of the spin lattice relaxation time against frequency should have the 
axis labels T1/S and v/Hz. Each manuscript copy must include a complete set of photocopies of the figures 
together with a set of self-explanatory captions, typed on a separate sheet.<P>
<P>
<H4>Colour illustrations.</H4>
Figures may be printed in colour within the text of an article, when colour is necessary to the scientific 
content of the paper.  No charge will be made for their publication.  A set of colour prints must accompany 
each of the three manuscripts requested for submission.<P>
<P>
<H4>Nomenclature.</H4>
All compounds should be named unambiguously according to the IUPAC Nomenclature System; see, for 
example, the latest Index Guide of Chemical Abstracts.  Where complexities arise the alternative use of 
clear chemical/structural formulae is recommended. Acronyms for materials are not acceptable unless they 
are first clearly defined by an IUPAC name or a formula.<P>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>Information for Authors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<I>Deviant Behavior</I> provides a forum for recording and disseminating the latest and most insightful 
scientific investigations of cultural norm violation and attendant social disvaluement.  The vagaries of 
social deviancy are explored with the widest possible latitude for theoretical perspective and 
methodological persuasion, and the concerns of description, etiology, analysis, prevention, or control may 
be invoked.  Papers dealing with traditional areas of deviant behavior are encouraged, as are papers 
addressing more narrowly defined examples of deviancy.  Conventional and controversial viewpoints are 
equally welcome.<P>
<P>
Submission of a manuscript to this journal is understood to imply that it or substantial parts of it have not 
been published or accepted for publication elsewhere and that it is not under consideration for publication 
elsewhere.<P>
<P>
<H4>Submission of manuscripts</H4>
Original and four copies of the manuscript should be submitted to the editor.  All accepted manuscripts, 
artwork, and photographs become the property of the publisher.<P>
<P>
<H4>Transfer of copyright</H4>
All papers accepted for publication must be accompanied by a copyright release form signed by the author 
This form is available from the editor.  Written permission from the copyright holder is required for all 
figures, tables, and quotations of more than 100 words.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Manuscripts</H4>
All manuscripts must be typed double-spaced on 8 1/2" x 11" paper on consecutively numbered pages.  Be 
sure that every table has a concise title.  Papers that do not conform to these requirements may be returned 
to the authors for correction and thus be delayed in publication. All papers shall be reviewed.  Authors 
shall be notified of acceptance.<P>
<P>
<H4>References</H4>
Should be listed at the end of the paper and refer only to material cited in the manuscript.  They should be 
listed in alphabetical order and basically follow the current American Sociological Review style.  In text, 
reference citations should include author and year of publication (Brown 1978).  Identify subsequent 
citations of the same source in the same way as the first, not using ibid., op. cit., or loc. cit.  Give both last 
names for dual authors; for more than two use "et al." in the text.  When two authors have the same last 
name, use identifying initials in the text.  For institutional authorship, supply minimum identification from 
the beginning of the complete citation (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1963, p. 117).<P>
<P>
In the reference section, list all source citations by author, and within author by year of publication.  The 
reference list must be complete and include all references in the text.  The use of "et al!' is not acceptable in 
the reference list; provide the names of all authors.  If there is more than one reference to the same author 
and year, distinguish them by the letters a, b, etc., added to the year (Levy 1963a).  Give the publisher's 
name in as brief a form as is fully intelligible. For example, John A. Wiley &amp  Sons should be Wiley.  
If the cited material is unpublished, use "forthcoming" with the name of journal or publisher; otherwise use 
"unpublished."<P>
<P>
In text, list multiple citations in parentheses in chronological order from earliest to most recent.  If 
additional questions arise regarding the appropriate format to use in preparing manuscripts for submission 
to <I>Deviant Behavior</I>, please consult the most recent edition of the American Sociological Review 
for appropriate guidelines.<P>

<TITLE>ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>INFORMATION FOR CONTRIBUTORS</H3></CENTER>
The <I>Annals of Human Biology</I> publishes papers, short reports, invited reviews, and letters on 
human ecology, demography, growth and evolution, and the genetics and physiology of human 
populations.<P>
<CENTER><B>TYPESCRIPTS</B></CENTER><P>
<P>
Typescripts should be sent to:<P>
<CENTER>General Editorial Office, Annals of Human Biology,<BR>
33 Cranbrook Road, London W4 2LH.</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<B>Typescripts must follow the style outlined below;  otherwise they will he returned unreviewed.</B><P>
<P>
FOUR copies of typescripts should be submitted, typed in double spacing, of which three may be 
photocopies, with corresponding sets of illustrations.  Papers are published in English only; French and 
German summaries of each paper are supplied by the publisher.  Footnotes are not accepted.  Typescripts 
are considered for publication only on the understanding that they have not been submitted nor published 
elsewhere.  All typescripts are sent to two members of the Editorial Board for refereeing.<P>
<P>
Before preparing the final copy of the typescript contributors should familiarize themselves with 
<I>General Notes on the Preparation of Scientific Papers</I> (Royal Society, 1965) and <I>Units, 
Symbols &amp  Abbreviations</I> (Royal Society of Medicine, 1977).  The style indicated in these 
pamphlets should be followed except that journal titles in the references should be given in full.<P>
<P>
Papers should follow the conventional form: <I>Introduction, Materials and methods, Results, 
Discussion</I> and <I>References</I>.  A summary of not more than 300 words should be typed on a 
separate page.  This should be drafted so that, when read in isolation, it will convey in precis form, the 
whole content of the paper.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>TITLE PAGES</B></CENTER><P>
should carry the title, the name and affiliations of the authors, the full address for proofs, and a 
running title of not more than 50 characters for page headings.  When two or more authors are from the 
same institution, their names should if possible be juxtaposed.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>TABLES</B></CENTER><P>
should be given Arabic serial numbers, and typed each on a separate page.  Their captions, typed 
below the tables, should describe their content sufficiently so they are intelligible without reference to the 
main text.  The same data should not be reproduced in both tables and figures.  The usual statistical 
conventions should be used: a value written 10.0 ± 0.25 indicates the estimate for a statistic (e.g. a mean) 
followed by its standard error.  A mean with an estimate of the standard deviation will be written 10.0 SD 
2.65.  Contributors reporting ages of subjects should specify carefully the age groupings: a group of 
children of ages e.g. 4.0 to 4.99 years may be designated 4 +; a group aged 3.50 to 4.49 years 4 ± and a 
group all precisely 4.0 years, 4.0.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>ILLUSTRATIONS</B></CENTER><P>
should each be on a separate page.  The copy for reproduction should bear the figure number and the 
contributor's name in pencil on the back.  Originals, drawn in Indian ink on drawing paper,  or made with 
Letraset, should be submitted; or else good quality glossy prints.<P>
<P>
A list of legends should be typed on a separate page in double spacing.  Illustrations should be intelligible 
without reference to the main text.  Photographs should be submitted as glossy black-and-white prints.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><B>REFERENCES</B></CENTER><P>
should be given following the Harvard system with the surname of the author(s) and year of 
publication in the text (thus: Smith, Jones and McDonald 1974) and a list of references arranged in 
alphabetical order of first authors at the end of the paper.  When a paper has more than two authors, all 
names should be given the first time the reference is cited in the text and thereafter the first name only, 
followed by et al.; if a second paper is cited with the same first author and date, the papers should be 
distinguished by adding a or b in both the text and references.  In the list of references the authors' 
surnames and initials only should be given; the year; the title of the paper or chapter, the unabbreviated title 
of the journal, underlined; the volume number (wavy underlining in typescript); and the first and last page 
numbers.  Thus:<P>
  Smith, A. B., Jones, C. D., and McDonald, E. E, 1974, WHO gene-frequencies and menarcheal age in the 
Daleks of Shepherd's Bush.  <I>Journal of Mechanical Persons</I>, 10, 72-84.<P>
<P>
References to books should include, where necessary, chapter title, number of edition and page number as 
well as place of publication.  Thus:<P>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>INFORMATION FOR AUTHORS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The journal of <I>Personal and Interpersonal Loss</I> will consider scholarship on personal loss-such as 
ageing, loss of health, stigmatization, and losses due to impoverishment, homelessness, and the like and 
interpersonal loss-including dissolution of friendships or close relationships and divorce.  The journal seeks 
to broaden the reader's perspective on loss and bereavement and their pervasiveness in human life.  Loss is 
defined as a major reduction in a person's resources-personal, material, or symbolic.  Empirical articles, 
reviews, essays, and commentaries are welcomed. <P>
Submission of a manuscript to this journal is understood to imply that it or substantial parts of it have not 
been published or accepted for publication elsewhere and that it is not under consideration for publication 
elsewhere.<P>

<TITLE>Notes for Contributors</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Notes for Contributors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<I>Philosophical Magazine</I> publishes full-length papers describing original work in the experimental, 
theoretical and applied physics of condensed matter.  This journal, <I>Part A</I> covers <B>Structure, 
Defects and Mechanical Properties</B>.  <I>Part B</I> covers <B>Statistical Mechanics, Electronic, 
Optical and Magnetic Properties</B>.  <I>Philosophical Magazine Letters</I> publishes short and 
significant contributions in areas covered by both <I>Part A and Part B</I>.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Manuscripts</H4>
Submissions must report original research not previously published or being considered elsewhere. Three 
copies of the manuscript are required, each with a complete set of line drawings and/or photographs (one 
set of originals and two sets of good copies).  Manuscripts should be printed in double spacing throughout, 
preferably on A4 (210 mm x 297 mm) or on 8 1/2 in x 11 in plain paper.  Adequate spacing is particularly 
important in the abstract, displayed equations, references and figure captions.  Tables, references and figure 
captions should be prepared on separate sheets.  Section headings should be concise, prominent and 
numbered sequentially (using a decimal system for subsections).<P>
<P>
Punctuation should be carried through to displayed equations, where normal sentence construction applies.  
Hyphenation should be used to achieve accuracy and clarity.  The Concise Oxford Dictionary is adopted as 
a standard for spellings.  All abbreviations should be spelt out on their first appearance.  References should 
be cited in the text using the author/date format: (Anderson 1964); (Mott and Davis 1979); first citation 
(Anderson, Halperin and Varma 1972); thereafter (Anderson et al. 1972).  They should be listed at the end 
in alphabetical order. Significant equations should be displayed centrally and numbered on the right.  
Generous spacings should be allowed within formulae so that instructions can be given to the typesetter to 
achieve a balanced, clear display.  Symbols, units and their display should conform to the 
recommendations of the Royal Society publication Quantities, Units and Symbols.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Figures</H4>
Figures should be prepared to the highest standard.  Line figures and photographs for half-tone 
reproduction must be complete with all lettering and labels.  Photographs for half-tone reproduction should 
be on glossy paper.  In preparing artwork, attention should be paid to the thickness and height of lettering 
to allow for reduction to appropriate size.  All figures must be clearly identified.<P>
<P>
<H4>Details of Publication</H4>
<H4>Corresponding authors will receive proofs.</H4>
These should be checked carefully and returned promptly in order to avoid delays in publication.  There 
are no page charges and 50 offprints are supplied free of charge.  Additional offprints can be ordered from 
the publisher by completing the form which accompanies the proofs.  Authors are asked to conform to the 
usual practices of the Copyright Clearance Center by assigning their copyright to the publisher<P>
<P>
Contributors to <I>Philosophical Magazine</I> should send their manuscripts in English to Dr W. M. 
Stobbs, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge, Pembroke Street, 
Cambridge C132 3QZ, UK. fax (44) 1223 334567, email "wms 11@cus.cam.ac.uk".<P>

<P>
<CENTER><H3>Notes for Contributors</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<I>Philosophical Magazine</I> publishes full-length papers describing original work in the experimental, 
theoretical and applied physics of condensed matter.  This journal, <I>Part B</I> covers <B>Statistical 
Mechanics, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Properties</B>.  <I>Part A</I> covers <B>Structure, 
Defects and Mechanical Properties</B>.  <I>Philosophical Magazine Letters</I> publishes short and 
significant contributions in areas covered by both <I>Part A</I> and <I>Part B</I>.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Manuscripts</H4>
Submissions must report original research not previously published or being considered elsewhere. Three 
copies of the manuscript are required, each with a complete set of line drawings and/or photographs (one 
set of originals and two sets of good copies).  Manuscripts should be printed in double spacing throughout, 
preferably on A4 (210 x 297 mm) or on 8 1/2 in x 11 in plain paper.  Adequate spacing is particularly 
important in the abstract, displayed equations, references and figure captions.  Tables, references and figure 
captions should be prepared on separate sheets.  Section headings should be concise, prominent and 
numbered sequentially (using a decimal system for subsections).<P>
<P>
Punctuation should be carried through to displayed equations, where normal sentence construction applies.  
Hyphenation should be used to achieve accuracy and clarity.  The Concise Oxford Dictionary is adopted as 
a standard for spellings.  All abbreviations should be spelt out on their first appearance. References should 
be cited in the text using the author/date format: (Anderson 1964); (Mott and Davis 1979); first citation 
(Anderson, Halperin and Varma 1972); thereafter (Anderson et al. 1972).  They should be listed at the end 
in alphabetical order.  Significant equations should be displayed centrally and numbered on the right.  
Generous spacings should be allowed within formulae so that instructions can be given to the typesetter to 
achieve a balanced, clear display.  Symbols, units and their display should conform to the 
recommendations of the Royal Society publication Quantities, Units and Symbols.<P>
<P>
<H4>Preparation of Figures</H4>
Figures should be prepared to the highest standard.  Line figures and photographs for half-tone 
reproduction must be complete with all lettering and labels.  Photographs for half-tone reproduction should 
be on glossy paper.  In preparing artwork, attention should be paid to the thickness and height of lettering 
to allow for reduction to appropriate size.  All figures must be clearly identified.<P>
<P>
<H4>Details of Publication </H4>
Corresponding authors will receive proofs.  These should be checked carefully and returned promptly in 
order to avoid delays in publication.  There are no page charges and 50 offprints are supplied free of 
charge.  Additional offprints can be ordered from the publisher by completing the form which accompanies 
the proofs.  Authors are asked to conform to the usual practices of the Copyright Clearance Center by 
assigning their copyright to the publisher.<P>
<P>
Contributors to Philosophical Magazine B should send their manuscripts in English to Dr J. L. Smith, Mail 
Stop K763, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545, USA, fax (1) 505 665 
8601, email "JLSMITH@LANI.GOV", or to any one of the Associate Editors.<P>

<H4>PSYCHOLOGY ONLINE</H4>
In Spring 1996 Psychology Press of Erlbaum (UK) Taylor &amp  Francis plans to make all of its 17 
psychology journals available on Internet. Our service provider, Catchword,  has set up a system which 
provides a browsable, fully searchable electronic journal available to any number of concurrent users 
across a local area network - and with their free RealPage TM software, we have ensured that the journal 
online has the same high quality graphics as it does in print. <BR>
<BR>
"Psychology Online" will include new papers from all seventeen Psychology Press journals in one 
database.  Initially, access to this database will be restricted to libraries and other institutions, but on 
completion of a Site License form they will be entitled to network the database to individual psychologists 
within their institution. Institutions will be entitled to access,  free of charge, papers from the journals they 
have subscribed to for 1996.  They will effectively have a multimedia subscription for the same price as the 
traditional printed version. <BR>
<BR>
If a search of the database finds a paper from a Psychology Press journal that the institution does not 
subscribe to, a charge will be made for the delivery of this paper. We will offer a convenient and simple 
way of prepaying for the retrieval of such "non-subscribed" papers: a 10 paper subscription to the 
Electronic Journal. On purchase of such a subscription, an institution will be allowed to retrieve and deliver 
to the desks of individuals within the institution any 10 papers in the database. Of course, they may also 
retrieve free of charge papers from journals they subscribe to.<BR>
<BR>
The launch of this Electronic Journal means that, in addition to the traditional wide distribution of the 
printed versions, Psychology Press journals will be available electronically to virtually every research 
psychologist in the world.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Applied Energy Technology Series</B><BR><B>
</B><BR>
<H3>SPECIAL FEATURES</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Emphasis on the energy resources that are directly tied to the alleviation of petroleum 
dependence and cleaner and better use of the existing fuel resources, rather than on energy sources 
that have only limited or specific applications
<LI>Necessary thermodynamic and process data, as well as recent advances in technology. are also 
presented.
<LI>Review questions are provided at the end of each section
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
During the past several decades, there has been considerable increase in research and development in the 
area of environmentally acceptable alternative fuels.  More recently, emphasis has been placed on more 
reliable sources of energy that are environmentally acceptable and satisfy the current energy consumption 
patterns.  From the viewpoints of synthesis and process chemistry, chemical engineering, process 
technology, and engineering design, this unique and comprehensive book presents information on the 
science and technology of alternative fuels: coal utilization, synthesis gas, coal liquid, slurry fuels, energy 
integration, oil shale, tar sands, geothermal energy, biomass conversion, and energy from solid wastes,<BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
Engineers and scientists working in the area of fuel science and engineering, as well as students studying in 
the field will find this to be a very useful handbook.  It compiles a large amount of information and data in 
a comprehensive but consistent manner thus making it convenient for researchers and professors alike.<BR>

<BR>
Work-related pain problems are epidemic.  In the past decade there has been an explosion of occupational 
musculoskeletal problems with gradual, non-traumatic onset.  The resulting concern, cost, and controversy 
are huge.  This book confronts head on an emerging issue: What is the role of non-physical factors in this 
epidemic?  This question is at the heart of the debate, and in answering it the book suggests ways in  which 
the epidemic might be controlled.<BR>
<BR>
Internationally recognised professionals present the latest research thinking, ensuring throughout their 
findings are grounded in practicality.  The office environment, with its emphasis on keyboard and visual 
display terminal use is a particularly rich and instructive study environment. <BR>
<BR>
The book offers a bridge between mind and muscle.  It insists that "psychosocial" does not imply "less 
real" - or even "imagined".  It explores issues beyond the traditional biomechanical and biomedical, into 
the realm of the psychological, social, organizational, cultural, and motivational. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>An Introduction to Turbulence</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<B>Paul A. Libby</B> (University of California, San Diego)<BR>
<BR>
<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Provides an introductory overview of the subject
<LI>Incorporates current perspectives and entries to the literature on a wide range of relevant topics
<LI>Emphasises understanding and insight rather than numerical computation to allow students to 
gain enhanced fluid mechanical capabilities and a comprehensive understanding of turbulence
<LI>Enhances the capability of the students to deal with the equations encountered in fluid 
mechanical structures
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with a description of turbulence, its various manifestations, and a brief  history of its study, this 
text also covers direct numerical stimulation and large eddy simulation of turbulence, the need for 
statistical description of many turbulent flows, the techniques necessary to deal with such a description, the 
averaging of the conservation equations, the physics and mechanics of turbulence, the fundamental aspects 
of turbulence, full conservation equations, the closure problems and classical closure models, applications 
to free shear flows and boundary layers, and methods based on second moment closure.  Meaningful 
exercises are included in every section to supplement the lectures and the student's reading.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
Graduate students and professionals involved in fluid dynamics, combustion, numerical methods and heat 
transfer<BR>

<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Focuses on the second order turbulence closure model, the most promising and practical model 
for engineering problems, and its application to engineering problems.
<LI>Presents turbulence modelling in a more systematic and logical fashion, including the historical 
view and utilizes a set of turbulent model postulations.
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
Turbulent flow motions occur in many engineering problems and in our environment.  Although the 
Navier-Stokes equations can properly describe the turbulent flow, it is too costly and often unnecessary for 
engineers to obtain such a complex and detailed solution.  Instead, averaged Navier-Stakes equations are 
sufficient to describe the turbulent motion confronted in engineering problems.  To recover the information 
lost during the averaging process, a turbulence model must be introduced.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
Engineering graduate students and professionals involved in the field of turbulence modelling.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Transport Phenomena in Combustion</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<B>Edited by S.H. Chan</B>, (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee)<BR>
<BR>
<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Researchers and practitioners from around the world present their new developments and discuss 
the state-of-the-art and future directions of the design of low emission, high efficiency combustion 
systems.
<LI>Over 150 papers provide an extensive review of contemporary topics
</UL>
<BR>
Today's engineers and scientists are often confronted with complex combustion phenomena which depend 
on interrelated processes of mass transfer, chemical kinetics, thermal transport, and fluid flow.  Such 
interrelated processes play a key role in the design of many industrial combustion systems ranging from 
power generation ground transportation, aeronautics and space transport, fire prevention and safety, 
pollution control, and clean fuel technology, to waste management and destruction.  This two volume set 
contains a record of the proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Transport Phenomena in 
Combustion held in July 1995 in San Francisco, California which addressed this issue.<BR>
<BR>
This collection of papers covers a well-balanced spectrum of topics from the fundamentals of ignition, 
extinction. and reaction kinetics to the recent advances in NOx and soot emission, droplet and spray 
combustion, laminar flames and turbulent combustion, fire spread and suppression, propellants and 
explosion, experimental and diagnostic methods, internal combustion engines, advanced combustion in 
porous media, numerical simulation, complete flame modeling of low NOx burners, furnaces and boilers, 
and their flame/radiation and thermal transport problems, and many more.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
Thermodynamics, fluids engineering, combustion, heat transfer, energy engineering professionals and 
libraries.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Published August 1996</H4>

<HR>
<BR>
<H4>1. <A NAME = GEN></A>General</H4>
Articles should be prepared in accordance with the Notes for Contributors reproduced on the inside back cover 
of the journal.  They may be submitted in electronic form on disc (see below for details) but <B>three</B> 
printed hard-copies should be provided at the same time.  When the paper has been refereed, revised versions, 
incorporating any changes recommended by the referees and/or required by the Editor, are likely to be 
requested from the author(s) and these should be accompanied by new electronic files which match the contents 
of the revised manuscript.  It is essential that authors use the electronic form they are submitting to produce the 
hard copies.  This is to ensure that the versions match and thereby to avoid unnecessary confusion and delay at 
the typesetting stage.  Where versions differ, the paper copy will take precedence over the electronic form.<BR>
<BR>
If suitable, the electronic files will be used to produce the final printed version of the paper which should result 
in a significant shortening of the time between acceptance and publication as well as reducing any errors that 
might otherwise be introduced during typesetting.  However, authors should note that almost all articles require 
some editing and in any case, for consistency in appearance, the journal's house style will be applied to the 
files.<BR>
<BR>
Provision of an e-mail address and/or a fax number will speed up communications between authors and the 
Editor or the Publisher if these are necessary.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>2.  <A NAME = SUBFORM></A>Submission Formats</H4>
<BR>
<H4><A NAME = DISCS></A>Disks</H4>
<BR>
Electronic submission can be on 3.5 or 5.25 inch discs.  PC discs should be formatted using MS-DOS (version 
3.0 or later) as either 720 kbytes or 1.44 Mbytes if 3.5 inch, or as 1.2 Mbytes if 5.25 inch.  Macintosh discs 
should be formatted as 800 kbytes or 1.4 Mbytes.  Currently we are unable to provide an ftp service but it is 
hoped that this can be arranged in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<H4><A NAME = TEXTFORM></A>Text Formats</H4>
<BR>
Text may be submitted in TeX or LaTeX.  It is important that any macro or style files accompany the 
submission.  Texts prepared in Microsoft Word or<B> </B>WordPerfect are also acceptable; however, if these 
wordprocessing packages are used, tables, formulae and equations will be re-keyed by a typesetter using the 
hard copy.  Other wordprocessing software can be used but ASCII files should then accompany the text file.<BR>
<BR>
<H4><A NAME = GRAPHICSF></A>Graphics Formats</H4>
<BR>
Line diagrams, half-tone figures and photographs must be submitted as reproducible hard copy owing to the 
difficulty of obtaining acceptable print quality from electronic scanned versions of these. However, where 
suitable electronic versions exist, and accompany the submission, then every effort will be made to use 
them.<BR>
<BR>
Line diagrams can be submitted in electronic format.  These should be in Encapsulated Postscript (EPS) or 
Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) with the latter being preferred.  When an EPS file is sent, it should be 
accompanied either by a TIFF file or the name of the source application e.g. Aldus Freehand, Corel Draw or

</B><BR>
<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Each chapter describes particular applications of the finite element method and illustrates the 
concepts through example problems.
<LI>A comprehensive appendix lists computer codes for 2-D fluid flow, a general applications 
program for calculating -D and axisymmetric heat confer and elasticity, and two 3-D transient codes 
for solution of advection-diffusion equations and heat transfer with radiation
<LI>A floppy disk includes source and executable versions of the software accompanies the text.
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
The finite element method is a unique numerical approach used to solve partial differential equations which 
describe engineering and scientific problems.  The method is particularly effective in problems requiring 
the numerical solution of transient or steady state advection- diffusion transport.  In this book, a follow-up 
to the introductory text, The Finite Element Method.  Basic Concepts and Applications by the same 
authors, the finite element method used to solve these more difficult but more realistic problems is 
advanced.  The solution of Lieu and non-linear partial differential equations is the primary emphasis of this 
advanced text. with a particular concentration on the equations of viscous fluid motion.<BR>

<B>Series in Chemical and Mechanical Engineering</B><BR><B>
</B><BR>
<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>A unique book combining in-depth and authoritative coverage of both experimental and 
theoretical procedures for VLE.
<LI>It provides the reader with an up-to-date survey of the many different models and approaches in 
the recent literature, along with advantages and disadvantages for some theories and equations so that 
meaningful choice may be made. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
When engineers need to separate one chemical from another, the process concept must be first chosen, To 
determine this, it is necessary to know the relevant physical properties and the relationships between the 
pairs of compounds to be separated, and example of the latter being vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE).<BR>
<BR>
Dealing with both high and low pressure VLE, this book will enable those entering the field of VLE 
measurement or those experiencing difficulty with a particular apparatus to select sound methods or 
alternatives.  This proves to be. quite important when designing expensive distillation and absorption 
equipment, as well as the separation process itself. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
Written as a reference for practising engineers and scientists in the chemical engineering field, this book 
will also be useful as an advanced graduate level text<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Human Factors in Nuclear Safety</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<B>Neville Stanton</B>, Department of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK<BR>
<BR>
<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Presents an integrated approach to human factors aspects of nuclear power
<LI>Gives practical methods and examples
<LI>Recognises that many incidents and accidents in the nuclear power industry are due to "human" 
failure
<LI>The findings in this book may be applied more widely to any complex technical industrial 
environment
</UL>
<BR>
Ergonomics, or human factors has much to offer nuclear safety - the technical achievement in the nuclear 
industry is considerable, yet there is much to be discovered about human functioning in such environments.  
Incidents at Three Mile Island in the USA and Chernobyl in the former USSR have been much cited in the 
press and highlight the need for a greater focus on "human" aspects of safety.<BR>
<BR>
This new book sets out to provide a balance between academic research and application of principles to the 
domain of nuclear power.  Guidelines and models are included to allow this.  It deals with issues from 
design of the control room in nuclear power stations to selection, and training of personnel and 
organisational issues.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
Professionals in the nuclear power industry and engineering generally.  It has a place as a text-book for 
students on ergonomics and human factors courses, and for those studying risk management engineering 
and ergonomics within psychology courses.<BR>

<H3>Birmingham Object Recognition Battery</H3></CENTER>
<B>M. JANE RIDDOCH, GLYN W. HUMPHREYS (University of Birmingham)</B><BR>
<BR>
BORB provides a set of standardised procedures for assessing neuropsychological disorders of visual 
object recognition, based on tests developed in the cognitive neuropsychological literature. The tests are 
introduced in terms of cognitive neuropsychological analyses of object recognition, and guidance is given 
concerning test use and interpretation. The tests assess low-level aspects of visual perception (using same-
different matching of basic perceptual features, such as orientation, length, position and object size), 
intermediate visual processes (e.g., matching objects different in viewpoint), access to stored perceptual 
knowledge about objects (object decision), access to semantic knowledge (function and associative 
matches) and access to names from object (picture naming). BORB will serve as an invaluable companion 
test battery to the PALPA test of language ability. <BR>
<BR>
Tests Included: Drawing from Memory. Copying. Length Match Task. Size Match Task. Orientation 
Match Task. Position of Gap Match Task. Overlapping Figures. Minimal Feature View Test.  
Foreshortened View Task. Object Decision Task. Function Match Task. Associative Match Task. Picture 
Naming (Short Version). Picture Naming (Long Version).<BR>

Ethanol is a versatile transportation fuel that offers high octane, high heat of vaporization, and other 
characteristics that allow it to achieve higher efficiency use in optimized engines than gasoline.  Ethanol is 
low in toxicity, volatility, and photochemical reactivity. resulting in reduced ozone formation and smog 
compared to conventional fuels.  This new book addresses key aspects of ethanol production from 
inexpensive and abundant cellulosic biomass sources such as agricultural and forestry residues, municipal 
solid waste, waste paper, and woody and grassy crops.<BR>

<CENTER><H4>Notes for Contributors</H4></CENTER>
<I>Philosophical Magazine Letters </I>publishes short contributions describing original research in the general 
field of condensed matter physics, i.e. the area covered by Part A (Defects and Mechanical Properties) and Part B 
(Structural, Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Properties) of Philosophical Magazine.  Work should be of sufficient 
merit and interest to warrant rapid publication.  Letters on new and emerging topics are particularly welcome.<P>

<CENTER><H4><A NAME = prepman></A>Preparation of Manuscripts</H4></CENTER>
Submissions must report original research not previously published or being considered elsewhere. Manuscripts 
should be no longer than about six printed pages and the number of figures should not exceed three.  Three copies 
of the manuscript are required, each with a complete set of line drawings and/or photographs.  Manuscripts should 
be printed in double spacing, preferably on A4 (210 x 297 mm) or on 8 1/2in x 11in plain paper.  Adequate spacing 
is particularly important in the abstract, references, displayed equations and tables.  Tables, references and figure 
captions should be prepared on separate sheets.  Section headings should be concise, prominent and numbered 
sequentially.<P>
<P>
Punctuation should be carried through to displayed equations, where normal sentence construction applies.  
Hyphenation should be used to achieve accuracy and clarity.  The <I>Concise Oxford Dictionary </I>is adopted as 
a standard for spellings.  All abbreviations should be spelt out on their first appearance.  References should be cited 
in the text using the author/date format: (Anderson 1964); (Mott and Davis 1979); first citation (Anderson, Halperin 
and Varma 1972); thereafter (Anderson <I>et al. </I>1972).  They should be listed at the end in alphabetical order.  
Significant equations should be displayed centrally and numbered on the right.  Symbols, units and their display 
should conform to the recommendations of the Royal Society publication <I>Quantities, Units and 
Symbols.</I><P>
<P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME = prepfig></A>Preparation of Figures</H4></CENTER>
Figures should be prepared to the highest standard.  Line figures and photographs for half-tone reproduction must 
be complete with all lettering and labels.  Photographs for half-tone reproduction should be on glossy paper.  In 
preparing artwork, attention should be paid to the thickness and height of lettering to allow for reduction to 
appropriate size.  All figures must be clearly identified.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><H4>Electronic Submission</H4></CENTER>
Instructions for electronic submission of manuscripts can be obtained from the Editors (addresses below) or by 
email from "ead1@leicester.ac.uk".<P>
<P>
<CENTER><H4><A NAME = detpub></A>Publication</H4></CENTER>
Letters are normally published within 10-14 weeks of acceptance.  To ensure rapid publication, general processing 
and refereeing will be accelerated and extensive revision following a referee's report will not normally be permitted.  
Authors will receive proofs, but must communicate corrections within seven days of their outward despatch.  If 
return of proofs is delayed, they will be seen by the Editors and checked by the Publisher and, whether or not 
corrections have been received from the author, the Letter will then go ahead for publication.<P>
<P>
There are no page charges and the principal author will be sent free of charge 50 offprints of the Letter.<P>
<P>
Contributors to <I>Philosophical Magazine Letters </I>should send their manuscripts to Professor E. A. Davis, 
<I>Philosophical Magazine Letters, </I>Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, University 
Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK; or to Dr S. R. Elliott, <I>Philosophical Magazine Letters, </I>Department of 
Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB2 IEW, UK.<P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>Green Technology and Design for the 
Environment</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<B>Samir B. Billatos</B> (University of Connecticut)<BR>
<BR>
<H4>SPECIAL FEATURES</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Written to change one's approach to the practical application of engineering
<LI>Provides up-to-date coverage of the most important aspects of "green technology"
<LI>Contains end-of-chapter questions to ensure the reader's full comprehension of topics
</UL>
<BR>
Recent developments in concurrent engineering have changed our approach to the practical application of 
engineering with great success by improving the methodologies of design and manufacturing.  Shorter 
development cycles, lower rejections rates. and improved quality are visible benefits of these new methods.  
Green engineering provides a complimentary focus by directing these new methods towards a specific 
purpose.  It defines and internalizes at the product design stage, those "external" parameters which affect 
the overall environmental impact of a product. eliminates toxic pollutants, and minimizes wastes and 
depletion of resource , often with a net cost of savings.<BR>
<BR>
Environmental regulations, to the extent that they affect the cost of products, are a relatively new 
development.  Recent experience has demonstrated that systematic elimination of waste and environmental 
impact can provide net economic and strategic benefits in higher quality products, more efficient 
operations, and the good will of an informed public that will expect a cleaner, healthier environment.  As 
regulations become more demanding and the public more aware, the incentive for green engineering will 
become more apparent.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>READERSHIP</H4>
This introductory text to green technology and design for the environment (GTDFE) is intended for 
graduate students. but working professionals will also find it useful as a reference.<BR>

<BR>
PALPA has been designed as a comprehensive psycholinguistic assessment of language processing in adult 
acquired aphasia. Intended both as a clinical instrument and research tool, PALPA is a set of resource 
materials enabling the user to select language tasks that can be tailored to the investigation of an individual 
patient's impaired and intact abilities. The detailed profile that results can be interpreted within current 
cognitive models of language. The materials consist of 60 rigorously controlled tests of components of 
language structure such as orthography and phonology, word and picture semantics and morphology and 
syntax. The tests make use of simple procedures such as lexical decision, repetition and picture naming and 
have been designed to assess spoken and written input and output modalities. Particular attention has been 
paid to practical use of the tests in the clinic and comprehensive guides have been included that help to 
suggest which selection of test may be appropriate for each aphasic person. Each test is also accompanied 
by detailed instructions of how and why it was constructed, how to use it, and by presenter's forms and 
marking sheets. The package consists of a box of five spiral bound sets of tests and instructions plus one set 
of master sheets of patient profiles, score sheets, etc., for photocopying by purchaser.<BR>

Exeter) Eds. <BR>
<BR>
Connectionist natural language processing (CNLP) is a new and burgeoning research area. This book 
represents a timely assessment of the state of the art in the field. It includes contributions from some of the 
best known researchers in CNLP and covers a wide range of topics. The book comprises four main sections 
dealing with connectionist approaches to semantics, syntax, the debate on representational adequacy, and 
connectionist models of psycholinguistic processes.  The semantics and syntax sections deal with a variety 
of approaches to issues in these traditional linguistic domains. The chapters cover the spectrum from pure 
connectionist approaches to hybrid models employing a mixture of connectionist and classical AI 
techniques. The debate on the fundamental suitability of connectionist architectures for dealing with 
natural language processing is the focus of the section on representational adequacy. The chapters in this 
section represent a range of positions on the issue, from the view that connectionist models are intrinsically 
unsuitable for all but the associationistic aspects of natural language, to the other extreme which holds that 
the classical conception of representation can be dispensed with altogether. The final section of the book 
focuses on the application of connectionist models to the study of psycholinguistic processes. This section 
is perhaps the most varied, covering topics from speech perception and speech production, to attentional 
deficits in reading. An introduction is provided at the beginning of each section which highlights the main 
issues relating to the section topic and puts the constituent chapters into a wider context.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>SPSS/PC+ MADE SIMPLE</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
PAUL R. KINNEAR, COLIN D. GRAY (University of Aberdeen)<BR>
<BR>
"Its distinctive features are that it is designed for psychologists and has a wide range of psychological 
examples: and that it offers elementary step-by-step instructions for quite advanced techniques such as 
factor, discriminant and log-linear analysis...The large format is good for displaying program output, and 
the print is widely spaced and readable...Kinnear and Gray provide excellent support to a beginner who 
wants to use SPSS without disasters." British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 1994; 
Reviewed by E.A. Gaffan <BR>
<BR>
The mainframe version of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSSx) has always been a 
daunting prospect for newcomers. The PC version of SPSS, however, which is known as SPSS/PC+, is 
much more accessible and friendly than its mainframe parent, especially when used in its Menu and Help 
mode of operation. By selecting from the Menu, the user who has not yet learned SPSS syntax can paste 
correctly-written commands on to an area of the screen known as the scratch pad. <BR>
<BR>
The first five chapters introduce the reader to the SPSS/PC+ system, describing the preparation of data 
commands, and the exploring of data. There is also advice about choosing an appropriate statistical test. 
The remaining ten chapters are self-contained, each dealing with a particular test or procedure, with 
preliminary comments about its use and the conditions that must be satisfied for its correct application. The 
description of each method is followed by a fully worked example, complete with commands and 
annotated listing (output). These chapters include t-tests, various models of ANOVA, association, 
regression, loglinear analysis, discriminant analysis, and factor analysis. The book has evolved from a 
manual which the authors wrote for use by their students and has benefited greatly from student response. 
The book features: <BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCY</H3>
<B>Its Role in Mental Development</B></CENTER><BR>
JAMES RUSSELL (Cambridge University)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"This is a bold and ambitious book which directly challenges many of the current orthodoxies in 
psychology and cognitive science...It is original in its general conception, and will be read with 
interest." <B>Jose Luis Bermudez (University of Cambridge)
</B><LI>"I enjoyed reading [the book] and found its central contentions and arguments extremely 
interesting and (to a considerable extent) persuasive." <B>Jane Heal (University of 
Cambridge)</B>
<LI>"The basic idea is very interesting and original...Two great swathes of philosophy have remained 
largely untapped in the developmental psychology of intentionality: the analysis of reasons and 
rationality, and the analysis of agency. It is excellent to see a sustained attempt to put the latter on the 
agenda." <B>Norman Freeman (University of Bristol) 
</B></UL>
<BR>
The thesis of this book is that developing a conception of the physical world and a conception of mind is 
impossible without the exercise of agency, meaning `the power to alter at will one's perceptual inputs'. This 
view also lies at the heart of Jean Piaget's account of mental development. However, the book is far from 
being a restatement of Piaget's position because its thesis is rooted in a philosophical account of the role of 
agency in knowledge - the first time this has been attempted in a developmental context. The argument is 
advanced through reference to the work of Kant and Schopenhauer and to contemporary work by 
philosophers such as O'Shaughnessy; after this, its implications for development are spelt out in review of 
experimental work on sensorimotor development and on developing a `theory of mind'.<BR>
<BR>
The book is three parts. In Part One Russell discusses fundamentally `representational' theories of 
cognition (`language of thought', mental models and connectionism) and concludes that mental 
development cannot be understood entirely in terms of representational change - clearing the ground for 
the book's central thesis. In Part Two, the relation between agency, spatial concepts and objectivity is 
discussed and the view advanced that the objectivity of the physical world must be grasped through 
experiencing the way in which objects resist the infant's will. In Part Three, Russell argues that there is a 
conceptual linkage between agency, mental unity and the first-person thoughts, a claim which generates an 
original theory of the nature of certain `stage-like' transitions in mental functioning and of the relationship 
between executive and `mentalising' deficits in autism.<BR>

<B>Vertaald en bewerkt door:   ROELIEN BASTIAANSE, MARJAN BOSJE, EVY VISCH-
BRINK</B><BR><B>
</B><BR>
De PALPA is een uitgebreide testbatterij, ontworpen voor het onderzoeken van de psycholinguistische 
vermogens van volwassen patienten met een verworven afasie. De PALPA is zowel een diagnostisch als 
een onderzoekinstrument en bevat een hoeveelheid materiaal die de gebruiker in staat stelt om taken te 
selecteren die zijn toegesneden op de gestoorde en intacte vermogens van de individuele patient. Het 
resultaat is een gedetailleerd profiel dat kan worden geinterpreteerd in termen van huidige cognitieve 
taalmodellen. <BR>
<BR>
Het materiaal bestaat uit 52 nauwkeurig gecontroleerde tests op woordnieveau en betreft de verschillende 
componenten van de taalstructuur, zoals orthografie en fonologie, woord- en beeldsemantiek en 
morfologie. De tests maken gebruik van eenvoudige procedures, zoals lexicale decisie, herhalen en 
benoemen van plaatjes en zijn ontworpen om de gesproken en geschreven input- en outputmodaliteiten te 
onderzoeken. Er is speciale aandacht besteed aan het gebruik in de kliniek en er zijn duidelijke 
aanwijzingen bijevouegd, die behulpzaam kunnen zijn bij het selecteren van vervolgtests voor de 
betreffende patient. Bij elke test is bovendien een gedetailleerde beschrijving gegeven over hoe en waarom 
de test is samengesteld en hoe de test te gebruiken. Per test zijn proefleider- en scoreformulieren 
bijgevoegd. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>VESPAR  -  A Verbal and Spatial Reasoning 
Test</H3></CENTER>
<B>DAWN W. LANGDON, ELIZABETH K. WARRINGTON (National Hospital for Neurology and 
Neurosurgery, London)</B><BR>
<BR>
The VESPAR is a new test of reasoning designed to measure fluid intelligence in neurological patients 
with more accuracy than has hitherto been possible. It comprises six sections, three matched sets of verbal 
and spatial reasoning problems, each dedicated to one of three forms of inductive reasoning: odd one out, 
by analogy and series completion. The VESPAR overcomes the constraints of classical tests of reasoning 
by using simple stimuli that are more readilyaccessed by patients who have suffered physical or cognitive 
impairments as a result of neurological illness. It does so by not timing performance, by using high 
frequency stimulus words and by using visually distinct spatial stimuli. A multiple choice format has been 
adopted to reduce both short term memory load and output demands on the patient. The reasoning items 
are all novel, thus the contribution of stored knowledge and procedures are reduced to a minimum. The 
assessment ofpatients for neurodiagnostic and neurorehabilitation needs will be facilitated. Patients with 
motor disabilities orspeech production impairments will be less handicapped than on other tests, by the 
VESPAR's requirement for simple "pointing"response. A measure of fluid intelligence can be obtained in 
patients with aphasia on the spatial section o  the test and in patients with visual and spatial problems on 
the verbal section.<BR>
<BR>
The VESPAR's low reliance on learnt knowledge makes it a good indicator of innate ability, relatively 
unaffected by educational experience. Thus, although originally developed for adult neurological 
populations, the test is suitable for a wide range of clinical, educational, occupational and research 
applications.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF 
PSYCHOLOGY</H3>
<B>Factors Facilitating and Impeding Progress in Developing Countries A special issue of the 
International Journal of Psychology</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
JOHN ADAIR (University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada) Ed.  <BR>
<BR>
This special issue focuses on the factors facilitating and impeding discipline development in developing 
countries. Eight articles that were originally presented in two IUPsyS-sponsored symposia at the 
International Congress of Applied Psychology in Madrid, Spain in July, 1994, articulate the conditions 
under which research is conducted and that influence discipline progress in developing countries. The 
symposia were organized as a follow-up to a similar IUPsyS-sponsored conference held in Edinburgh in 
1982. Based on the assumption that the application of psychology to the local culture and its contribution 
to the solutions of national social problems are determined in part by the level of its development within 
each country, the articles focus on the dynamics of discipline development -- on the processes and factors  
impeding and facilitating progress, rather than on descriptions of the status of the discipline within each 
country.  Written by leading psychologists within eight different countries, the special issue brings a 
breadth of experiences and perspective to national discipline development. The first four articles examine 
th e influence of the research environment, post-graduate research training, government, societal, and other 
systemic considerations, and international and developed-world psychology on national discipline 
development. Commentaries on these articles from the regional perspective of contributors from South 
Asia, China, Latin America, and Africa in the final four articles bring to life the special factors within each 
context that contribute to discipline development. An introduction by the issue editors summarizes the 
commonalities among these papers and their implications for the future of the discipline. <BR>

<B>A Special Issue of Applied Psychology</B></CENTER><BR>

ESTHER GREENGLASS, JUDI MARSHALL (York University, Ontario, Canada) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The Special Issue on Women and Management is an important milestone for Applied Psychology: An 
International Review, as it provides a forum for women's voices in an area that has been traditionally 
dominated by men. The issues addressed here provide valuable insight into why and how women continue  
to be repressed and silenced in male dominated organizations, despite the advances made by the Women's 
Movement in legal and employment spheres. The papers in this issue make clear why a psychological 
approach is essential to the understanding of the continued repression of women even when they possess 
the requisite qualifications for management positions. The fact remains that, worldwide, women remain 
conspicuously absent from the ranks of senior management, arenas of power and major decision making. 
This Issue is unique in that it brings together original papers which give a psychological perspective on sex 
discrimination and how women's opportunities are limited in the management field. At the same time, the 
Special Issue points to important ways in which change may be achieved through recognition of women's 
interpersonal competence and through modification of structural features which have traditionally 
characterized organizations. The Special Issue is intriguing, probing and provocative. It offers a fresh 
approach to the role of women in management and their future opportunities.<BR>

<TITLE>BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS IN THEORY AND PRACTICE</TITLE>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS IN THEORY AND 
PRACTICE</H3>
<H3>Contributions and Controversies</H3></CENTER>
DEREK E. BLACKMAN (University of Wales College of Cardiff), HELGA LEJEUNE (University of 
Li)<BR>
<BR>
This edited book addresses four themes of contemporary importance in the experimental and applied 
analysis of behaviour: chronobiology (relationships between time and behaviour), the emergence of 
rational thinking, language, and behavioural medicine. The current empirical and theoretical status of each 
theme is considered in individual chapters, the authors of which are distinguished research scientists drawn 
from a wide range of scholarship and with a distinctive European dimension. This cultural and theoretical 
diversity emerges from the fact that each chapter is developed from a paper originally presented by 
invitation at the Second European Meeting on the Experimental Analysis of Behaviour , which was held in 
Li.<BR>
<BR>
Within the four themes, individual topics address issues such as circadian rhythms in behaviour, temporal 
regulation in children and in animals, the emergence of equivalence relations in children and animals, the 
development of thinking in mentally retarded children, reasoning and associative learning in animals, rule-
governed behaviour, theoretical issues relating language to the theory of mind, the relationship between 
behavioural and visceral functions, the relevance of behavioural approaches to the prevention of AIDS, and 
the development of self-detection skills for breast cancer. <BR>
<BR>
The book makes an important contribution to the literature of contemporary behaviour analysis by 
reviewing issues of current interest and importance from a broad theoretical base.  <BR>

This new journal publishes high quality research concerned with all aspects of visual cognition. This 
includes, for example, studies of visual object and face recognition (from edge extraction to accessing 
stored knowledge representations), texture and surface perception, perceptual organization, dynamic 
aspects of vision,  visual attention, long-term and short-term visual memory, visual imagery, visual word 
recognition, eye movement control in reading and scene perception, context effects in reading, object and 
face recognition. Papers tackling these topics from a range of perspectives are accepted, including: 
experimental studies of normal visual cognition, developmental, neuropsychological,  psychophysiological, 
neuroanatomical and computational studies. By bringing together work within the field, <I>Visual 
Cognition</I> provides researchers with a unique venue for papers cutting across traditional research 
boundaries. Papers that make a novel theoretical contribution to the literature are especially welcome.  The 
journal is interdisciplinary, drawing on the research of developmental psychologists, experimental 
psychologists, cognitive scientists and neuropsychologists, as well as cognitive psychologists.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to taking full-length papers making theoretical contributions to the literature, manuscripts that 
are short, (for instance, containing a single experiment or a commentary on other papers) can be considered 
for publication, provided they make a useful empirical or theoretical impact. Similarly, papers presenting 
only a theoretical analysis or a review are welcome providing they are original and of a high standard of 
scholarship.<BR>

<TITLE>EMOTION IN SOCIAL LIFE</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>EMOTION IN SOCIAL LIFE</H3>
<H3>A Special Issue of Cognition and Emotion</H3></CENTER>
ANTONY S.R. MANSTEAD (University of Manchester) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
The last two to three decades have witnessed a steady growth in research on emotion, but relatively little of 
the psychological research has focused on the role of emotion in social life. Instead, there has been a 
concern with the impact of cognition on emotion; the impact of mood and emotion on cognition; the 
neurological substrates of emotion; the psychophysiological correlates of emotion, and the nonverbal (and 
especially facial) expression of emotion. With the possible exception of the last topic, these are all 
essentially individualistic research issues, concentrating on the intra-individual processes that link 
biological activity, cognitive activity, and expressive activity with subjective feeling states. However many 
psychologists and probably the majority of other social scientists interested in emotion acknowledge that 
extra-individual processes are also important aspects of emotion, either contributing to the experience and 
expression of emotion, or providing the context in which emotions manifest themselves in altered 
perceptions and judgements, changes in expressive behaviour, and strengthened or weakened social 
relationships.  <BR>
<BR>
There are at least five ways in which emotion and social life are related: (i) affective states have an impact 
on social judgement and social perception; (ii) social contextual factors influence emotional expression and 
experience; (iii) emotions help to create, maintain, and dissolve social relationships; (iv) emotions are 
communicated to others either intentionally or unintentionally through verbal or nonverbal channels; and 
(v) emotions serve important social functions.  Each of these five links between emotion and social life is 
addressed by at least one of the chapters published here. By illustrating the significance of the reciprocal 
relationship between emotion and social life, this volume should encourage theorists and researchers to 
treat social and cultural variables as central to the study of emotion.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>ANXIETY</H3>
<H3>The Cognitive Perspective</H3></CENTER>
MICHAEL W. EYSENCK (Royal Holloway University of London)<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Despite having such a lengthy history to contend with, this book manages to break new ground 
in a number of directions...Eysenck explores the relationship between normal and clinical anxiety in 
considerable detail and rounds it off by presenting his own model of why some individuals are 
vulnerable to becoming clinically anxious...Emerging from an intelligent and considered review [of 
his research] is Eysenck's suggestion that some individuals are `hypervigilant to threat in their 
environment'." <B>Times Higher Education Supplement, 1993; Review by Tim Dalgleish
</B></UL>
<BR>
Theorists are increasingly arguing that it is fruitful to approach anxiety from the cognitive perspective, and 
the empirical evidence supports that contention. The cognitive perspective is also adopted in this book, but 
the approach represents a development and extension of earlier ones. For example, most previous theories 
and research have been based on anxiety either in clinical or in normal groups. In contrast, one of the 
central themes of this book is that there are great advantages to be gained from a joint consideration of 
clinical and normal anxiety.<BR>
<BR>
Another theme of this book is that it is of major importance to establish whether or not there is a cognitive 
vulnerability factor which is associated with at least some forms of clinical anxiety. It is argued (with 
supporting evidence) that there is a latent cognitive vulnerability factor for generalized anxiety disorder 
which manifests itself under stressful conditions. This vulnerability factor is characterized by 
hypervigilance, and is found predominantly in normals high in the personality dimension of trait anxiety.  
The scope of the book extends to the effects of anxiety on performance and to the phenomenon of worry, 
which is regarded as the cognitive component of anxiety. In both cases, a new theoretical framework is 
presented. <BR>

ADRIAN WELLS (University of Oxford), GERALD MATTHEWS (University of Dundee)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"A major contribution to the study of cognition and emotion. In addition to an authoritative and 
extremely comprehensive review of the literature, the authors present us with an innovative theory 
which places strategic processes, self- focused attention and meta-cognitive beliefs in centre stage. 
Thought provoking and rewarding, this book has much to interest emotion researchers, students and 
clinicians." <B>David M. Clark, University of Oxford 
</B><LI>"Even seasoned researchers in the field will find much of interest...The authors are to be 
congratulated on taking a clear theoretical view, which can be debated and investigated by others. 
Whether it turns out to be right or wrong, this will undoubtedly make the book a more significant 
contribution to the literature." <B>Fraser Watts, MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge 
</B><LI>"This book presents the most thorough and detailed review of the complex area of attention 
and emotion yet written. The authors have comprehensively examined the extensive research 
literature and have original and insightful comments to make about almost every study and article 
they discuss. Despite working in the area for a number of years I found myself being forced to view 
familiar studies and ideas in a new light and one can ask nothing more from a book than this!" 
<B>Tim Dalgleish, Institute of Psychiatry</B>
</UL>
<BR>
A way forward in cognitive-behavioural theory and treatment of emotional problems rests with the 
development of more advanced cognitive processing models of the mind and self-regulation. This book 
critically reviews the literature on attention and emotion, and offers an integrative cognitive attentional 
model of the development and maintenance of emotional disorders. It highlights the similarities and 
differences between disorders and is one of the first information-processing accounts to offer specific new 
treatment implications. The arrival of this book marks an influential step closer to a complete cognitive 
model of emotional disorders. It brings new horizons for the development of cognitive-behavioural 
research and treatment in the future.<BR>
<BR>
The book contains numerous summary sections so that readers less familiar with the cognitive literature 
can follow the main issues without feeling overwhelmed. Nevertheless this book still represents the most 
thorough and detailed yet written on the subject. The central aims of this work are: To critically review 
current models of attention, and their application to attentional processes in emotional disorders. To 
develop an integrative theoretical framework and model for conceptualising attentional processes 
associated with the aetiology and maintenance of emotional stress reactions. To discuss the implications for 
clinical practice of attentional theories of emotional dysfunction. Even the most experienced of researchers 
are likely to find this book an important source of new ideas. It has the advantage of falling at the boundary 
areas between cognitive- experimental, social and clinical psychology, representing a contribution to 
several literatures. <BR>

<TITLE>E.H. WEBER ON THE TACTILE SENSES</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>E.H. WEBER ON THE TACTILE SENSES</H3></CENTER>
Edited and translated by HELEN E. ROSS and DAVID J. MURRAY<BR>
<BR>
The first edition of this book (E.H. Weber: The Sense of Touch, Academic Press, 1978) has long been out 
of print. Interest in Weber's work continues, and this revised edition commemorates the bicentenary of his 
birth. It is published through the cooperation of the Experimental Psychology Society and Erlbaum (UK) 
Taylor &amp  Francis. The title has been broadened to reflect the fact that Weber explored all the skin 
senses - and indeed the muscle sense and that mysterious entity ~the common feeling~. The introduction 
has been expanded to include further information on Weber's life and times, and on recent research 
relevant to Weber's on work. The translations of Weber's main works of psychological interest (De Tactu 
and Der Tastsinn und das Gemeingefuhl) contain only minor changes, but the footnotes have been updated. 
The reader will find here much more than those topics for which Weber is best known - the two-point 
threshold, experiments on weight discrimination and a statement of what is now called Weber's Law. <BR>
<BR>
Weber also made interesting remarks on many aspects of sensory psychology - on left-right asymmetry in 
sensitivity, on visual resolution, the binocular combination of colours, the moon illusion, on summation, 
inhibition and adaptation in sensory systems, on the difference between simultaneous and successive 
presentations, on selective attention, the externalisation of sensations and the difference between sensation 
and perception. As a scientist, Weber was working in the new area of experimental psychology. As a 
philosopher, he bridged the gap between philosophy and experiment. His work remains of interest to 
historians of science, to philosophers and to sensory psychologists. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Reviews of the First Edition:</B><BR><B>
</B><UL>
<LI>"Weber's combination of systematic method, empirical flair and ultimate loyalty to anatomy and 
physiology, is oddly reminiscent of the wayward genius of Kenneth Craik.... Dr Ross's translation.. 
has successfully grasped the content of Weber's work and captured the essentials of his style..... Dr 
Murray's translation easily attains professional standard...he has shown himself capable of unusual 
insight into the German natural philosophy of the period." <B>O.L.Zangwill (Quarterly Journal of 
Experimental Psychology, 1979, 31: 358-359.) 
</B><LI>"The two translators have carried out their work with loving care, and the result is both 
highly readable, and full of matters of topical interest.... The huge industry that has been built on this 
observation (sc. Weber's Law) contrasts strangely with the relative neglect of other findings, such as 
the greater sensitivity of the left half of the body in comparison with the right, or the work on 
binocular combination of colours... Finally, let us pay tribute to these early experimenters in 
psychophysics for their complete disregard of personal comfort; ~My brother, Eduard Weber, filled 
both entrances to his ears with water and introduced two metal rods, thereby closing the circuit and 
evoking, through the induction of two very large magnets, a strong current under particularly 
favourable circumstances~. Other hazards of the laboratory... included ice-cold enemas and the 
hammering of fingernails. ~Bliss was it in that morn to be alive~: but you certainly needed to be 
tough." <B>M.J.Morgan (Perception, 1979, 8: 723-724.)</B>

<BR>
Vision allows us to do many things. It enables us to perceive a world composed of meaningful objects and 
events. It enables us to track those events as they take place in front of our eyes. It enables us to read. It 
provides accurate spatial information for actions such as reaching for or avoiding objects. It provides 
colour and texture that can help us to separate objects from their background, and so forth. This book is 
concerned with understanding the processes that allow us to carry out these various visually-driven 
behaviours. In the past ten years our understanding of visual processing has undergone a rapid change, 
primarily fostered by the convergence of computational, experimental and neuropsychological work on the 
topic. Visual Cognition provides the first major attempt to cover all aspects of this work within a single 
text. It provides a state-of-the-art summary of research on visual information processing, relevant to 
advanced undergraduates, postgraduates and research workers. It covers: seeing static forms, object 
recognition, dynamic vision (motion perception and visual masking), visual attention, visual memory, 
visual aspects of reading. For each topic, the relevant computational, experimental and neuropsychological 
work is integrated to provide a broader coverage than that of other texts. <BR>

ROZ BRODY, NICKY HAYES<BR>
<BR>
In this book, Roz Brody and Nicky Hayes outline some of their ideas for making psychology teaching a 
useful and enjoyable experience. This text has been written to help both new and experienced teachers and 
lecturers present the subject by focusing on the key areas: cognitive psychology, social psychology, 
developmental psychology, individual differences, biopsychology, comparative psychology, and 
perspectives on psychology. Ideas for how teaching can be structured are presented in a lively manner, and 
there are suggested topic sequences designed for planning a modular course. Major themes and issues 
which emerge in, or can be drawn from, the different topics are discussed, along with ideas for how to 
bring each topic alive for students in the classroom or seminar group. There are comments and suggestions 
about how students sometimes react to different topics, along with useful ideas for practical work. Revision 
plans are made easier by the pleasure of sets of key terms and names of significant psychologists for each 
topic, in addition to suggested essay and revision questions.<BR>
<BR>
Roz Brody and Nicky Hayes are both experienced teachers of psychology. Nicky Hayes has worked with 
the Association for Teaching Psychology to help teachers develop resource material and teaching skills for 
many years, and Roz Brody has been actively involved in developing psychology courses for a wide range 
of students.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>BEHAVIOURAL EFFECTS OF CONTAMINATED

<B>Applying Psychology in Neurotoxicology A Special Issue of Applied Psychology</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
ANDREAS SEEBER (Institute of Occupational Health, University of Dortmund, Germany), ANDERS 
IREGREN (National Institute of Occupational Health, Sweden) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The research field of applied psychology is permanently growing, and in recent years psychologists have 
expanded their interests and activities into neurotoxicology. This development is due to the sensitivity of 
psychological methods in revealing changes in the functioning of the nervous system. For example, the use 
of neuropsychological methods measuring environmental impacts on the central nervous system aims at the 
first symptoms from acute exposures to low levels of solvent vapours. Sensory irritations, slight changes of 
reaction times and/or of the arousal level are typical signs indicating functional changes by solvent 
exposure. <BR>
<BR>
Ten contributions focusing on cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and neurophysiological effects of acute 
solvent exposure are presented. Discussed from the psychological point of view are: Ideas on monitoring 
for health in the workplace, experiences on and reasons for research strategies, specific experimental 
psychophysiological and psychological methods, and considerations on experimental approaches. The 
common object is to measure and to evaluate psychological and psychophysiological changes due to 
solvent exposure with relevance for workplaces. This special issue will be of interest to psychologists and 
occupational hygienists as well as researchers of different disciplines in ergonomics and environmental 
sciences. <BR>

<H4>REVIEW IN NATURE</H4>
"...Gathercole and Conway have provided psychologists with a forum in which to present high-quality 
research on all aspects of memory.  Succinctly titled, <I>Memory</I> has already provided subscribers 
with a steady flow of good papers and is excellent value for money; better value still, for those interested in 
one of the topics covered, are the series of special issues...The editors state that one of their policies is to 
produce special issues on topics of exceptional current interest and on research perspectives with which the 
general readership will not be familiar...this feature seems destined to become an important aspect of the 
journal's character."<BR>
<B>NATURE, Reviewed by Andy Calder</B><BR><B>
</B><BR>
<I>Memory</I> publishes high quality papers in all areas of memory research. This includes experimental 
studies of memory (including laboratory-based research, everyday memory studies, and applied memory 
research), developmental, educational, neuropsychological,  clinical and social research on memory. By 
representing all significant areas of memory research, the journal cuts across the traditional distinctions of 
psychological research. <I>Memory</I> therefore provides a unique venue for memory researchers to 
communicate their findings and ideas both to peers within their own research tradition in the study of 
memory, and also to the wider range of research communities with direct interest in human memory.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION</H4>
The journal welcomes all forms of original work of a high quality on memory. In addition to full reports of 
research, manuscripts which are short (for example, containing single experiments, or comments on other 
papers) will also be considered for publication,  provided that they are of significant empirical or 
theoretical impact. Alternative forms of manuscript, such as theoretical papers or reviews, are also 
welcome if they are of a high standard of scholarship and originality. <BR>
<B>Please send 4 copies of manuscripts (including submissions to special issues), to: </B><BR><B>

<BR>
<B>Reviews of First Edition:</B><BR><B>
</B><UL>
<LI>~The handbook that Glenys Parry and Fraser Watts have put together is particularly welcome...It 
provides excellent practical guidelines on every aspect of research, including selectingthe right 
approach, the use of computers, data analysis, writing up and applying for research grants...The 
chapter authors are well-established in their own areas. They write authoritatively, but in a way that 
does not alienate the relatively unsophisticated reader...Each chapter is well organised, and has 
references at the end of it, making the readers life easy. The overall editing is excellent. This volume 
is a must for the libraries of all mental health service, research and teaching departments. As the price 
is not too high, one hopes that individuals too will acquire copies - if not for their bookshelves, for the 
desk tops, as the editors suggest in their preface." -<B> P. de Silva</B>,
</UL>
<B>Behaviour Research and Therapy</B><BR><B>
</B><UL>
<LI>~At last a book that provides a relatively painless introduction to the research process for 
clinicians! The editors are to be congratulated on producing a volume comprising 15 chapters, each 
by a different author(s), which nevertheless is written in a uniformly accessible and concise style...as 
the editors hoped, it is the sort of book that clinicians wanting to do research should have on their 
desk tops.~ - <B>Jim Stevenson, Journal of Child Psychology &amp  Psychiatry, 1991

<UL>
<LI>"An Undertaking of this magnitude is not meant as light reading. Still, this splendid contribution 
to science will provide both mystery and fascination. Poulton does for the New Psychophysics what 
Gregory Kimble (1961) achieved in reworking Hilgard &amp  Marquis' Conditioning &amp  
Learning. He synthesizes, probes, criticizes, analyzes, and reveals features of experiments that must 
tantalize the theorist and prod the experimentalist toward future innovations. Put away you Sunday 
Times acrostics for the next few weeks. Let this extraordinary book guide you toward new thinking 
about psychological experiments" Stephen Link, American Journal of Psychology
<LI>"It is a unique book... It is an encyclopedic account of the systematic errors that can occur when 
subjects try to attach magnitudes to their experiences..." Philip T. Smith, Reading University. 
<LI>"...It is much needed and will be much cited. It compiles a wealth of otherwise disparate 
information into a structure unified by a consistent viewpoint and in a way that will be of practical use 
to people working with human judgement in pure and applied science." Dr. A.W. Macrae, 
Birmingham University 
<LI>"Poulton writes in a crisp clear style which is easy to follow and undergraduates here will have 
no difficulty in understanding him." Professor Donald Laming, University of Cambridge. 
</UL>
<BR>
This volume carefully catalogues and classifies the effect of bias on quantitative judgements. Each bias is 
described by model and examples of this bias are then given. The examples include both theoretical 
investigations carried out in the laboratory to study bias, and practical illustrations. They are accompanied 
by a discussion of methods of avoiding bias, where this is possible. This book will be an invaluable 
resource for investigators and practitioners in applied science.<BR>
<H4>Contents:</H4>

Biases. Transfer Bias. Bias in the Production of Power Functions.<BR>

<BR>
The question of whether some emotions are basic or fundamental has become critical for understanding the 
mechanisms of emotions. In this volume new evidence and new theoretical formulations are advanced by 
leading researchers in the field: Ekman, Johnson-Laird, Oatley, Stein, Trabasso, Davidson, Camras and 
Wierzbicka. The specially commissioned papers in this volume provide the first thorough discussion of the 
problem of basic emotions by a range of researchers with different viewpoints, and are essential reading for 
all those interested in emotions.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY</H3>
<H3>Research Directions in Cognitive Science: European 
Perspectives, Volume 1</H3></CENTER>
Alan Baddeley (MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge), Niels Ole Bernsen (Commission of the 
European Communities, Brussels, Belgium), Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The papers in this series of five volumes provide a snapshot of current trends in European Cognitive 
Science. Each of the volumes deals with problems in cognitive science from a different perspective, 
covering the interacting disciplines of cognitive psychology, logic and linguistics, human-computer 
interaction, neuroscience and artificial intelligence respectively. Based on the analysis and exposition of 
the state of the art in their various fields of expertise, the contributors take a prospective look at the basic 
research problems confronting cognitive science over the next five to ten years. Whilst the authors and 
editors do consider a wide range of research in their area, they have been encouraged to give their personal 
view of important directions rather than a bland comprehensive list. Although inevitably controversial, this 
approach allows a stimulating review of the field, and one which should inspire debate. The highly 
interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science research means that many issues such as natural language or 
vision are explored from diverse perspectives in papers representing different disciplines. Each 
contribution has been written in a way which makes it comprehensible to colleagues from neighbouring  
disciplines as well as students of cognitive science. It will be particularly useful to graduate students 
contemplating research projects. <BR>
<BR>
The work has been supported and coordinated by the research unit FAST (Forecast and Assessment in 
Science and Technology) of the EEC Commission in Brussels.<BR>

" Language Development in Exceptional Circumstances is an excellent review of 13 different "experiments 
of nature" each exploring a particular deviation from the typical language- learning circumstances, and its 
effects on the development of language. [It] succeeds in presenting a great deal of potentially disparate 
information in a coherent and usable fashion, and should be of value to both practitioners and theoreticians 
in the field of language development." Susan Goldin-Meadow (University of Chicago) in Language and 
Speech.<BR>
<BR>
Ever since attempts were made to describe and explain normal language development, references to 
exceptional circumstances have been made. Variations in the conditions under which language is acquired 
can be regarded as natural experiments, which would not be feasible or ethical under normal 
circumstances. This can throw light on such questions as: <BR>
what language input is necessary for the child to learn language?<BR>
what is the relationship between cognition and language?<BR>
how independent are different components of language function?<BR>
are there critical periods for language development?<BR>
can we specify necessary and sufficient conditions for language impairment?<BR>
This book covers a range of exceptional circumstances including: extreme deprivation, twinship, visual and 
auditory impairments, autism and focal brain damage. Written in a jargon-free style, and including a 
glossary of linguistic and medical terminology, the book assumes little specialist knowledge. This text is 
suitable for both students and practitioners in the fields of psycholinguistics, developmental and 
educational psychology, speech pathology, paediatrics and special education. <BR>

EMOTION</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of Cognition and Emotion</B><BR></CENTER>
<B>FRASER N. WATTS (MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge) Ed.</B><BR>
<BR>
Recent work on the neurological substrates of emotion promises to make a significant contribution to 
general theoretical issues concerning emotion. In a key-note paper for this volume, Klaus Scherer identifies 
these as including the interaction between cognition and emotion, the nature of the evaluative criteria 
employed in appraisal processes involved in emotion, whether these appraisal processes are organised 
sequentially or in parallel, and how far there is a differential patterning of discrete emotions. In a related 
general paper, Gerald Parrott and Jay Schulkin adopt a neuroscience perspective on the cognition-emotion 
debate, arguing that any affective system in the brain must be sophisticated enough in its computations to 
justify the label 'cognitive'. This is followed by an exchange in which Joseph Le Doux debates these issues 
with Parrott and Schulkin. A second group of papers focuses down on the issue of hemispheric 
specialization in the neural substrate of emotion. Guido Gainotti and his colleagues examine the 
relationship between left/right and cortical/subcortical dichotomies in brain specialization for emotion. 
Next, Elisabeth Ladavas presents significant empirical data from the study of a split-brain patient. Finally, 
Richard Davidson reviews the critical methodological and conceptual issues in studying cerebral 
asymmetries associated with emotion, emphasising the importance of acknowledging the multi-
componential nature of emotion. This collection of papers thus assesses the current contribution of 
neurological studies of emotion to more general emotion theory, and anticipates the prospects for a 
growing neurological contribution from future work.<BR>

<H3>The Issue of Cognitive Determinants of Emotion 
</H3>
<H3>A Special Issue of Cognition and Emotion </H3></CENTER>
NICO H. FRIJDA (University of Amsterdam) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
 Appraisal is a central notion in current theory. A process of appraisal can be considered the key to 
understanding that emotions differ for different individuals. Assuming a process of appraisal that mediates 
between events and emotions is the clue to understanding that a particular event evokes an emotion in one 
individual and not in another, or evokes an emotion at one moment, and no emotion, or a weaker or 
stronger one, at another moment. A process of appraisal also explains why an emotionally charged event 
elicits this particular emotion, and not another one, in this particular individual under these particular 
conditions. The process of appraisal accounts for the fact that the arousal of an emotion depends upon the 
meaning of the event for the individual and explains why the emotion that is evoked often depends upon 
quite subtle aspects of that meaning. Arousal of emotions is determined by the interaction between events, 
the individual's conceptions or expectations as to what constitutes well-being for him or her and the 
individual's expectations that he or she will be able to deal or cope with the event and, if so, in what 
manner or how effectively.<BR>
<BR>
To deal with these issues the notion of appraisal was developed in the early 1960s. In the early 1980s, a 
torrent of theoretical and empirical work broke loose in which the cognitive variables involved were 
spelled out in great detail. A large number of theoretical and empirical studies from quite diverse 
laboratories generated a highly cumulative body of research. However, it also generated disagreements, 
important questions (such as those regarding the importance of the place of cognition in emotion), and 
methodological objections. Also, few accounts were produced of the processes by which appraisal is 
supposed to operate. <BR>
<BR>
This Special Issue is one endeavour to take stock of the findings and problems concerning appraisal. It is 
called "Appraisal and Beyond," because it invited, and received, from leading contributors to the field, 
state-of-the-art reports of appraisal research, critical comments and suggestions that should carry the theory 
further.<BR>

<BR>
Visuospatial neglect is a frequent consequence of right brain damage. Patients with neglect seem to live in 
a subjective world that is skewed away from the left side. This "left neglect" which is often severe and 
long-standing, has deleterious effects upon everyday living and return to work. In addition, it can be very 
resistant to remedial efforts. The clinical significance of the condition is obvious, but why and how do 
these failures to notice, attend to and respond to objects and events in left space occur? The last two 
decades have seen an exponential increase in empirical research on neglect by behavioural neurologists and 
cognitive neuropsychologists. Yet we are still some way from a deep understanding of the different forms 
and fractionations of neglect. With this in mind, we have organised a new type of symposium.<BR>
<BR>
A representative sample of research groups that have shown a sustained interest in all facets of neglect was 
asked to produce "state-of-the-art" position statements on the topic: what is known about neglect; what is 
not known (or understood), and most importantly, where should maximal effort be directed in the future. 
The current collection of position papers (and prophesies) provides a comprehensive overview of work-in-
progress on neglect that cannot be gained from any other source.<BR>

<TITLE>TELEMATICS AND WORK</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>TELEMATICS AND WORK</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
J.H. ERIK ANDRIESSEN (Delft University of Technology), ROBERT A. ROE (Tilburg University), 
Eds.<BR>
<BR>
This volume is part of a publication series emerging from an international interdisciplinary study group on 
"New Technologies and Work (NeTWork)". NeTWork is sponsored by the Werner-Reimers Foundation 
(Bad Homburg, Germany) and the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme (Paris). The NeTWork study group 
has set itself the task of intellectually penetrating various problem domains posed by the introduction and 
spread of new technologies in work settings. This problem focus requires interdisciplinary co-operation. 
The usual mode of operating is to identify an important problem within the NeTWork scope, to attempt to 
prestructure it and then to invite original contributions from European researchers or research teams 
actively involved in relevant analytic or developmental work. <BR>
<BR>
A specific workshop serves to cross-fertilize the different approaches and to help to integrate more fully 
the individual contributions. The concept of telematics refers to the integration of computer, 
telecommunication and information technologies. It alludes to the opportunities presented by the technical 
means to communicate and transfer data over large distances by "intelligent equipment". Teleshopping, 
teleconferencing, teleworking and telebanking are but a few examples of a development which influences 
both public and private environments. Both households and workplaces are likely to be thoroughly 
changed by telematics. This publication emphasises the application of telematics in working environments. 
The central questions of the book are: How will the present and future development of telematics effect the 
nature and organization of work, and under which conditions will this development be optimal? From the 
various contributions it is clear that telematics is not a single direct cause or determinant of particular 
changes in work and organization. The development and application of telematics depend on decision 
making of actors at a political scene both outside and inside the work organizations. The effects of the use 
of these applications appear to be co-determined by many other factors. In fact, the technology interacts 
with political, economic, and social factors in a complex process that shapes new organizational forms and 
work relationships. <BR>

<BR>
A wide variety of quantitatively different forms of reading disorder have been identified and extensively 
described. These may be broadly classified into the peripheral and central dyslexias, according to whether 
the patients have impaired prelexical or impaired lexical/post-lexical processes. The Special Issue concerns 
peripheral reading disorders. These may be produced by various functional deficits, which may manifest 
themselves in clinical syndromes of neglect dyslexia and letter-by-letter reading. Detailed study of these 
syndromes should allow better understanding of how visual lexical access may normally be obtained.<BR>

JOHN RICHARDSON (Brunel University)<BR>
<BR>
The clinical problem of treating head injured patients is not to be solved by a dramatic medical 
breakthrough, but one which must be tackled by a better appreciation of their condition from both the 
neurological and the psychological points of view. It is therefore not surprising that there is a growing 
interest in research on the effects of closed head injury. The purpose of this book is to review the clinical 
and neuropsychological aspects of closed head injury in a manner which is intelligible to both clinicians 
and psychologists. This clearly written general text book on closed head injury is much needed in the 
current market.<BR>

<BR>
A.H. CRISP (St George's Hospital Medical School)<BR>
<BR>
This new log book brings together the in-patient version originally designed by Professor Arthur Crisp and 
Dr Kingsley Norton for use by people undergoing treatment in the Anorexia Nervosa unit at Atkinson 
Morley's Hospital, and the out-patient version published by Professor Crisp in 1993. The latter has been 
used by those attending the out-patient treatment programme of St. George's Hospital Medical School and 
the related Highly Specialist Services section of Pathfinder Mental Health Services NHS Trust, and in other 
centres in the UK.<BR>
The overall treatment programme is presented in the author's classic text Anorexia Nervosa: Let Me Be, 
first published in 1980 and now reprinted by the Psychology Press (see overleaf). The Patient's Log Book 
is intended for both initial in-patient and out-patient use, as part of a clinically supervised treatment 
programme based on the ~St George's~ approach (outlined in Anorexia Nervosa: Guidelines for  
assessment and Treatment in Primary and Secondary Care). More than one copy may be needed through 
the course of lengthy treatment. <BR>

<BR>
The psychological study of human reasoning has grown rapidly in the past decade and become a major 
focus for research in cognitive science. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology has a long 
tradition of publication of work on reasoning dating from the pioneering work of Peter Wason and 
colleagues in the 1960s. This Special Issue is representative of the range of tasks and issues which 
currently dominate research in the area. It covers studies of deductive, inductive and statistical reasoning 
and includes research on all three of the famous Wason tasks (2 4 6, selection task and THOG). The papers 
in this issue also address all four of the major contemporary theories of human reasoning based upon 
inference rules, mental models, heuristics and schemas.<BR>

<B>Piagetian Perspectives on Constructivism</B></CENTER><BR>
LESLIE SMITH (Lancaster University)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Leslie Smith's book could be seen as part of wider attempts to find common ground between 
philosophical and psychological approaches to knowledge (ie. between normative questions such as 
"what is knowledge?", and empirical questions such as "how does knowledge develop?")...Overall, 
this is a rich and eclectic book, sufficiently so to overcome amply the fact that its closely argued style 
makes the reader work hard. Even so, Smith makes it clear that it is not to be taken as a final and 
definitive statement. Given the relative ascendency of appeals to domain-dependent learning and of 
information processing accounts of development, it is, however, a timely reminder of what else needs 
to be considered, of what the debate should be about." <B>Andrew Tolmie (University of 
Strathclyde) in the BPS Developmental Psychology Newsletter, 1994.</B>
</UL>
<BR>
This monograph addresses a central problem in Piaget's work, which is the temporal construction of 
necessary knowledge. The main argument is that both normative and empirical issues are relevant to a 
minimally adequate account of the development of modal understanding. This central argument embodies 
three main claims.<BR>
<BR>
One claim is philosophical. Although the concepts of knowledge and necessity are problematic, there is 
sufficient agreement about their core elements due to the fundamental difference between truth-value and 
modality. Any account of human rationality has to respect this distinction. The second claim is that this 
normative distinction is not always respected in psychological research on the origins of knowledge where 
emphasis is placed on the procedures and methods used to gain good empirical evidence. An account of the 
initial acquisition of knowledge is not thereby an account of its legitimation in the human mind. The third 
claim relates to epistemology. Intellectual development is a process in which available knowledge is used 
in the construction of better knowledge. The monograph identifies features of a modal model of intellectual 
construction, whereby some form of necessary knowledge is always used. Intellectual development occurs 
as the reduction of modal errors through the differentiation and coordination of available forms of modal 
understanding. Piaget's work continues to provide distinctive and intelligible answers to a substantive and 
outstanding problem. <BR>

<LI>"This book performs an extremely relevant service by elucidating the contributions which the 
discipline of psychology can offer to the world of business. It build bridges between psychology and 
other structured areas of study, such as advertising. It answers the call for relevance without 
compromising the integrity of its subject. The book is clearly written and well organised, and strives 
to allow nothing to stand between the reader's appreciation of psychology and the way it informs very 
practical problems. I believe it will be seen as a pioneering book." Prof. John Child, Foreword to First

<B>Causes and Consequences</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
JONATHAN ST B T EVANS<BR>
<BR>
A good introduction to irrationality for anyone rational enough to read and ponder without prejudice. 
Stuart Sutherland (New Scientist).<BR>
<BR>
This book represents the first major attempt by any author to provide an integrated account of the evidence 
for bias in human reasoning across a wide range of disparate psychological literatures. The topics discussed 
involve both deductive and inductive reasoning as well as statistical judgement and inference. In addition, 
the author proposes a general theoretical approach to the explanation of bias and considers the practical 
implications for real world decision making. The theoretical stance of the book is based on a distinction 
between preconscious heuristic processes which determine the mental representation of (subjectively) 
'relevant' features of the problem content, and subsequent analytic reasoning processes which generate 
inferences and judgements. The author is neutral on the question of the mechanism of analytic reasoning, 
although some discussion of the major theoretical positions in the literature is included. The major focus, 
however, is upon the preconscious heuristics which are claimed to be the major cause of bias either by 
directing attention towards logically irrelevant information or away from relevant problem features.<BR>
<BR>
Phenomena discussed and interpreted within this framework  include feature matching biases in 
propositional reasoning, confirmation bias, biasing and debiasing effects of knowledge on reasoning, and 
biases in statistical judgement normally attributed to 'availability' and 'representativeness' heuristics. In 
addition, an entire chapter is devoted to the topic of self-knowledge in thinking and reasoning. It is 
contended that biases of unconscious origin defy detection because people lack insight into their own 
thought processes and are chronically prone to rationalisation and overconfidence. In the final chapter, the 
practical consequences of bias for  real life decision making are considered, together with various issues 
concerning the problem of 'debiasing'. The major approaches discussed are those involving education and 
training on the one hand, and the development of intelligent software and interactive decision aids on the 
other. <BR>

JOSE MAR~A PEIR~ FERNANDO PRIETO JOSE LUIS MELI~ OTO LUQUE Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The text presents a selection of contributions to the Sixth European Congress of Work and Organizational 
Psychology held in Alicante (Spain) in April 1993, some of which have been previously published in the 
European Work and Organizational Psychologist.<BR>
<BR>
The contributions selected to appear in this volume focus on some of the principal questions scholars and 
professionals concerned with work and organizational psychology are tackling in Europe. The range of 
topics, theoretical approaches, methodologies, and orientations discussed illustrate the richness and variety 
of ideas currently studied in the discipline.<BR>
<BR>
The topics addressed in this text have a clear significance for the current European scene of work and 
organizational psychology. Although they are not the only ones, the areas discussed present important 
trends and interests within the discipline. The main sections include contributions which deal with 
psychological characteristics and processes of individuals at work, work experiences and their relationship 
with psychological well-being, the study of work entry and work socialization, the study of teamwork in 
organizations, the study of leadership in organizations, new forms of work and organization, and the 
phenomenon of work in a social context.<BR>
<BR>
This book is intended to be of relevance and interest to both academics and practitioners in the field of 
work and organizational psychology.<BR>

<TITLE>BIRKBECK WORD ASSOCIATION NORMS</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3>BIRKBECK WORD ASSOCIATION 
NORMS</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
HELEN E. MOSS LIANNE J.E. OLDER (Birkbeck College, University of London)<BR>
<BR>
A reference work containing free association norms for over 2000 words in the English language, collected 
from groups of 40-50 British English speakers between the ages of 17 and 45, over the last eight years. 
These norms provide the information that, for example, 67% of people give dog as the first word they think 
of in response to the word cat, that 24% give the word society in response to pillar and in response to the 
name Michael, 65% say Jackson, while less than 5% come up with Heseltine or Caine.<BR>
<BR>
These norms will be of use to researchers and students in many fields of psychology, especially the study 
of language and memory, where the degree of association between pairs of words is often an important 
experimental variable. This is the first large scale collection of British English norms to be published; to 
date researchers have had to rely on out-of-date American norms or spend many hours collecting their own 
association data.<BR>
<BR>
The main part of the book contains an alphabetic list of all associative responses and their frequency for 
each of the 2391 stimulus words. In addition there is an index of stimulus words organised according to 
semantic category, to aid selection of experimental materials. Full methodological details of the collection 
and compilation of the data are also provided in the introduction. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS IN THE STUDY 
OF LANGUAGE</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of Language and Cognitive Processes</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
SUSAN GARNSEY (University of Illinois) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
A large part of the work in psycholinguistics in recent years has focused on trying to determine the time-
course of the processes that result in successful language comprehension. In order to answer questions 
about the time-course of comprehension, it is not sufficient to measure the end result. Techniques that 
measure comprehension processes as they proceed must also be used so called "on-line" measures. The 
goal of this special issue of Language and Cognitive Processes is to demonstrate how one particular 
technique, the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs), is being used to provide on-line comprehension 
measures. ERPs are both on-line and unintrusive on processing, which are very desirable features for a 
comprehension measure. In addition, ERPs can be obtained while people read and while they listen, so they 
can be used to compare visual and auditory comprehension. The contributing authors have each taken 
advantage of the properties of ERPs to tackle difficult questions about how comprehension proceeds.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY OF ALCOHOLISM</H3></CENTER>
<B>ROBERT G. KNIGHT BARRY E. LONGMORE (University of Otago,  Dunedin)</B><BR>
<BR>
Alcohol abuse is a major health problem in most parts of the world. In this book, focus is on the way in 
which alcohol affects the brain. The authors' aim is to describe advances in the neuropsychology of 
alcoholism in a way that makes this work accessible to clinicians from a variety of backgrounds, who treat 
people with alcohol-related problems. The book is divided into four sections. Part 1 provides 
anintroduction to the medical and neurological conditions that result from alcoholism, and to the process of 
neuropsychological assessment. The problems involved in conducting research in this area are also 
considered. In Part2, research that focuses directly on changes to the nervoussystem is surveyed. This 
includes studies of both the short-term and the chronic neurological changes to the brain caused by alcohol. 
In Part 3, studies of the neuropsychological effects of acute intoxication, social drinking, and alcohol abuse 
are described. Finally, in Part 4, the implications of neuropsychological research for the assessment and 
management of patients with alcohol problems are considered.<BR>
<BR>
The objective of this book is to collate the range of research work that is relevant to understanding how 
alcohol affects the brain. This includes both the acute and the chronic effects, at both the biological and 
physiological levels. As such, this volume provides a more comprehensive and integrated account of the 
neuropsychology of alcoholism than is available elsewhere. <BR>

"The authors succeed in presenting the present state of microcomputer-based cognitive retraining. The 
book is recommended in particular to those specialists who do clinical and/or research work with adult 
neurological patients. It also includes a useful (although probably rapidly changing) list of suppliers of 
cognitive retraining software and related material." Matti Laine (University of Turku) in the European 
Journal of Cognitive Psychology.<BR>
<BR>
The last decade has seen considerable development in the field of neuropsychological rehabilitation 
following brain damage and the use of computerised methods has attracted attention and stimulated 
controversy. This practically-oriented text reviews representative examples from the literature relating 
to the training of cognitive systems with the emphasis on studies describing the use of computerised 
methods. The topic is discussed in context and the Contents include sections on cognitive change in 
neurological disorders, assessment techniques, the interaction between cognition and behaviour and the 
advantages and disadvantages of the use of microcomputers. The authors describe the evaluation of a 
computerised cognitive retraining programme run at the Regional Neurological Centre in Newcastle-
upon-Tyne and draw on their experience of running such programmes to give practical guidance to 
those wishing to set up cognitive retraining programmes.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON 
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE</H3>
<B>Volume 1: Leading Themes</B><BR>

<BR>
PAUL BERTELSON, PAUL EELEN, GERY D'YDEWALLE (University of Leuven, Belgium)<BR>
<BR>
The essays appearing in these two volumes are based on Keynote (Vol. 1) and State of the Art (Vol. 2) 
Lectures delivered at the XXVth International Congress of Psychology, in Brussels, July 1992. The 
Brussels Congress was the latest in a series of conferences which are organized at regular intervals under 
the auspices of the International Union of Psychological Science (IUPsyS), the main international 
organization in the field of Scientific Psychology. The first of those meetings took place in Paris in 
1889.<BR>
<BR>
An important function of the International Congresses is to promote communication between different 
specializations in Psychology. Speakers were therefore asked to present lectures and discussions in their 
own fields of study, in a way that would be accessible to fellow psychologists active in other fields. <BR>
<BR>
State-of-the-Art lecturers were specifically asked to prepare a tutorial review on a topic which, in the view 
of the Program Committee, had recently given rise to particularly important developments. These 
contributions are included in Volume Two. Keynote lecturers were left free to address whatever subject 
they felt was of greatest interest. The chapters in Volume 1 are preceded by the Presidential Address by 
Mark R. Rosenzweig. <BR>

<LI>"It is a superb overview of biological, evolutionary, and psychological theories of depression 
and, in addition, is a significant contribution in its own right, not just as a work of synthesis, but also 
regarding its more original proposals concerning the importance of social rank and social attachments 
in the development of depressive disorder. This book should certainly be in the working library of 
every professional who has to think about, and work with, individuals who are experiencing and 
suffering depressive mood states." <B>Terry Birchmore in The British Journal of

Cognitive neuropsychology seeks to understand impairments of specific cognitive functions in relation to a 
model of normal cognitive processing. The conclusions drawn from the study of abnormal processes are in 
turn used in the development and testing of theories of normal cognition. This book represents the first 
attempt to synthesize and systematize progress so far. In addition to reviewing different forms of 
impairment and discussing their implications for theories of normal functioning, Human Cognitive 
Neuropsychology will critically examine the empirical and theoretical foundations of the subject, including 
the use of single-case studies, the assumptions that must be made about the organization of the mind and 
brain, the relevance of traditional syndrome categories, and the viability of a purely cognitive approach to 
brain injury separated from issues of the cerebral localisation of functions. The authors have two principal 
aims. The first is to explain the patterns of deficit found in patients in terms of impairment to functional 
components postulated in theories of normal, intact cognitive processing. The second is to draw 
conclusions about normal cognitive processes from the observed patterns of injury by asking the question: 
"How must the normal cognitive system be organised to be able to give rise to the observed combinations 
of intact and impaired skills?" Studying brain-injured patients thus provides a source of insight into 
cognitive functions that is separate from, but complementary to, standard laboratory experiments on 
normal subjects. <BR>

Working memory is a term used to refer to the systems responsible for the temporary storage of 
information during the performance of cognitive tasks. The efficiency of working memory skills in 
children may place limitations on the learning and performance of educationally important skills such as 
reading, language comprehension and arithmetic. This monograph considers the development of working 
memory skills in children with severe learning difficulties. These children have marked difficulties with a 
wide range of cognitive tasks. The studies reported show that they also experience profound difficulties on 
verbal working memory tasks. These memory problems are associated with a failure to rehearse 
information within an articulatory loop. Training the children to rehearse material is shown to help 
alleviate these problems.<BR>
<BR>
The implications of these studies for understanding normal memory development, and for models of the 
structure of working memory and its development are discussed. It is argued that the working memory 
deficits seen in people with severe learning difficulties may contribute to their difficulties on other 
cognitive tasks. <BR>

This text, written in clear, accessible language, covers aspects of animal behaviour featured in both A-level 
Psychology and Social Biology courses. It includes accounts and discussions of imprinting, maternal 
behaviour, courtship and territoriality, social organisation and animal communication. Throughout the 
book the principle of behavioural diversity is built upon to show the complexities of animal behaviour and 
its relationship with the social and physical environment. The issues and perspectives arising from 
evolutionary theory are explored, and the need to utilise multiple levels of analysis in the understanding of 
animal (and human) behaviour is emphasised.<BR>

This journal will publish high quality research concerned with all aspects of lateralisation. 
<I>Laterality</I>'s principal interest will be in the psychological, behavioural and neurological correlates 
of lateralisation. It will also be willing to publish accessible papers from any discipline which can 
illuminate the general problems of the evolution of biological and neural asymmetry, or on the cultural, 
linguistic, artistic and social consequences of lateral asymmetry, or on its historical origins and 
development.<BR>
<BR>
The interests of workers in laterality are typically broad, and inter-disciplinary work, either empirical or 
theoretical, or concerned with problems of measurement or statistical analysis,  will therefore also be 
encouraged. The journal will also publish special issues on particular topics.<BR>
<BR>
The first issue of <I>Laterality</I> is scheduled for publication in Spring 1996. Four issues will be 
published each year.<BR>

<LI>"The book's strengths are that it is written by an active researcher in the area who keeps his eye 
on the ball throughout. Although, strictly speaking, the work is a monograph offering a personal 
account of the area, it is not so idiosyncratic that one would worry about recommending it to students. 
It contains valuable summaries of the major tasks,  issues and theories in this well-worked field, and 
offers a synthesis which rises above a mundane literature review."  Peter J. Hampson (University 
College, Cork) in The Irish Journal of Psychology, 1991.
<LI>"On the whole, this little book offers a compact and comprehensive overview of the last 20 years 
of experimental study of printed word identification, by an active and involved contributor in the 
field." Alain Content (Universite Libre de Bruxelles) in the European Journal of Cognitive 
Psychology, 1993.

<BR>
Over the last twenty years a major area of Cognitive Psychology has developed centred upon research into 
the issues of how visually presented words are processed so that they can be read and understood. The 
focus has been on how words are stored in the mental lexicon and retrieved during the reading process. If 
we possessed no mental lexicon, we would be unable to read. This book dedicates itself to a critical 
evaluation of the ideas that have emerged from this body of research. <BR>
<BR>
The text outlines the major models of lexical processing that have been put forward in the literature, and 
how they explain the basic empirical findings that have been reported. It then goes on to consider the 
possible influence that sentential context has on lexical processing, the impact of the pronunciation of a 
word on its visual processing, and the role played by internal word structure (i.e., syllables and 
morphemes) in the recognition of a word. A connectionist style model emerges during the course of the 
evaluation of these issues.<BR>
<BR>
This book is suitable for advanced students and researchers, and is intended to serve as a springboard for 
discussion and an inspiration for empirical research. <BR>

<BR>
 Analogical reasoning is a fundamental cognitive skill, involved in classification, learning, problem-solving 
and creative thinking, and should be a basic building block of cognitive development. However, for a long 
time researchers have believed that children are incapable of reasoning by analogy. This book argues that 
this is far from the case, and that analogical reasoning may be available very early in development. Recent 
research has shown that even 3-year-olds can solve analogies, and that infants can reason about relational 
similarity, which is the hallmark of analogy. The book traces the roots of the popular misconceptions about 
children's analogical abilities and argues that when children fail to use analogies, it is because they do not 
understand the relations underlying the analogy rather than because they are incapable of analogical 
reasoning. The author argues that young children spontaneously use analogies in learning, and that their 
analogies can sometimes lead them into misconceptions. In the "real worlds" of their classrooms, children 
use analogies when learning basic skills like reading, and even babies seem to use analogies to learn about 
the world around them.<BR>

<TITLE>FACE RECOGNITION</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3>FACE RECOGNITION</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of the European Journal of Cognitive Psychology</B></CENTER><BR>

VICKI BRUCE (University of Stirling), Ed.<BR>
<BR>
The perception and recognition of faces forms a topic which interests cognitive psychologists for a number 
of reasons. First, our individual abilities to recognise several hundreds (perhaps thousands) of faces 
demonstrates the extraordinary power and sensitivity of our visual memory system. Second, due to the 
uniqueness of facial appearance, the face plays the same key role as the fingerprint in forensic 
identification, yet we have no simple way to reveal the image of the face in the witnesses' mind. Cognitive 
psychologists have an important role to play in determining the most effective ways of eliciting this hidden 
knowledge. Third, the face mediates a wider variety of cognitive/social activities than any other kind of 
visual object: we recognise our friends from their faces, but also whether they look tired or sad, whether or 
not they are listening to us, and their lip movements help us to understand the words they speak. Faces play 
a truly central role in our social cognitions and people who lose the ability to comprehend and recognise 
faces experience a profound effect on their social lives. The last decade has seen rapid theoretical progress 
as researchers interested in face recognition began to develop the same kinds of empirical and theoretical 
approaches to face recognition that had already proved fruitful in the study of visual word and object 
recognition. Much of this development has taken place within Europe, and so it seemed particularly 
appropriate that a special issue of a new European Journal should be devoted to this topic.<BR>
<BR>
The issue comprises eight articles that demonstrate the methodological diversity and theoretical coherence 
which now characterises the field. Following an initial theoretical overview by Andy Young and Vicki 
Bruce, there are seven empirical papers reporting important new findings from several European countries. 
Cognitive neuropsychology and computer modelling are included as well as the more traditional perceptual 
and cognitive experiments. <BR>

"The book is attractive because it is well written and concise on the one hand and theory-oriented and 
adequately documented on the other. It contains approximately 240 relevant references and useful author 
and subject indexes. Moreover, it is carefully edited and illustrated. Admirably, and most importantly, 
Maureen Cox displays her research inclination in every chapter by questioning the adequacy of earlier 
studies, by considering alternative explanations and by refraining from easy generalisations and sweeping 
statements. This serves to recommend her book to developmental psychologists, educators, and those 
interested in cultural and developmental aspects of graphic art." in the Bulletin of the International 
Graphonomics Society.<BR>

The human figure is one of the earliest topics drawn by the young child and remains popular throughout 
childhood and into adolescence. When it first emerges, however, the human figure in the child's drawing is 
very bizarre: it appears to have no torso and its arms, if indeed it has any, are attached to its head. Even 
when the figure begins to look more conventional the child must still contend with a variety of problems: 
for instance, how to draw the head and body in the right proportions and how to draw the figure in action.  
In this book, Maureen Cox traces the development of the human form in children's drawings; she reviews 
the literature in the field, criticises a number of major theories which purport to explain the developing 
child's drawing skills and also presents new data. <BR>

<BR>
During the last two decades, important developments and changes have occurred in Spain. One of the main 
consequences has been an impressive growth of psychological research and practice all around the country. 
The title of psychologist obtained the legal recognition and protection from the Parliament and the Spanish 
Crown and 14 Faculties of Psychology (in the European sense of Faculty) have been created within the 
university milieu. This monograph issue provides a general view by field of expertise of leading 
contributions and problem-solving strategies of Spanish researchers and practitioners to deal with societal 
demands and the advance of science. Due to the fact that there are 42 journals and magazines in the  
country that regularly publish papers and experiences produced by Spanish psychologists, only a minority 
of their findings and approaches are available for English-oriented audiences. This monographic issue tries 
to bridge this gap, providing a framework and summary in English.<BR>

QUENTIN SUMMERFIELD (MRC Institute of Hearing Research, University of Nottingham)<BR>
<BR>
Many experimental psychologists carry out research on hearing and speech, yet only rarely is their work 
reported in the Quarterly Journal. This Special Issue seeks to redress the imbalance. It contains nineteen 
papers contributed by scientists working in Britain, the U.S.A., and The Netherlands. The papers were 
among those submitted in response to a call for papers and were subjected to the Journal's usual process of 
peer review. Seventeen papers report new perceptual data. They cover a wide range of topical issues in 
speech perception and psychoacoustics including: profile analysis, comodulation masking release, and 
across-channel masking of modulated signals; adaptation, detection, and lateralization; frequency 
selectivity and the perception of loudness in listeners with impaired hearing; the analysis of cues to 
phonetic categories by listeners with normal hearing and by patients with cochlear implants; phonemic 
restoration; second-language learning; the role of resolved harmonics in specifying formant frequencies; 
audio-visual speech perception; and prosodic cues issued by talkers when correcting errors in speech 
production. Finally, two papers describe new models of auditory and perceptual processes: one is a 
mathematical account of audio-visual integration in speech perception; the other is a computational model 
of auditory stream segregation. Most of the papers are relatively short and have been written in a style that 
should make them accessible to a wide readership. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EMOTION AND 
UNDERSTANDING IN DEVELOPMENT </H3>
<B>A Special double issue of the journal Cognition &amp  Emotion</B></CENTER><BR>
JUDY DUNN (Institute of Psychiatry, London) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
Developmental studies are beginning to bring together previously separate areas of research on emotion 
and cognition, making this a particularly exciting time for a special issue of Cognition &amp  Emotion 
focusing on developmental research. Three themes, each central in current developmental studies, are 
brought together in this special issue, in which leaders in developmental research describe their most recent 
studies. These themes are the nature and developmental course of children's understanding of emotions, the 
development of children's understanding of mind, and the influence of a range of socialisation experiences, 
including emotional expression, on children's social relationships and behaviour. The studies in this issue 
bridge the gaps between these domains: they illuminate the connections, but also show us some of the 
differences in the pattern of children's development in emotion and understanding. Cutting across the 
studies described are a number of common themes: an interest in individual differences; in using natural 
language data and observational methods as well as experimental approaches; in gender differences in 
emotional expression and experiences and their implications; and, perhaps most striking of all, in framing 
developmental questions in terms of both cognitive and emotional development. The generative potential 
of the research described is unquestionable and the innovative combinations of interest in both cognitive 
and emotional aspects of development greatly to be welcomed. <BR>

<UL>
<LI>"In reflecting on this book, I realised that I know of no comparable attempt to describe such a 
comprehensive, unified theory of cognition and emotion. It is particularly impressive in the way it 
combines a vision for what phenomena need to be explained with an attnetion to the specific detail of 
the mechanisms needed to explain them. Overall, it is characterised by a sympathy for the reader for 
whom many of the concepts may be unfamiliar." <B>J. Mark G. Williams (University of Bangor) 
in Cognition &amp  Emotion, 1994.</B> 
<LI>"In conclusion, Teasdale and Barnard offer a model of emotion that is a significant conceptual 
advance over current cognitive clinical theorizing in depression. <B>David A. Clark in Behaviour 
Research and Therapy, 1994.
</B><LI>"This book represents a unique combination that has rarely if ever occurred before,in which 
one of our leading clinical psychologists has combined forces with one of our leading cognitive 
psychologists. ...a long awaited marriage that was guaranteed to be productive with something of 
interest for the clinician and the researcher alike." <B>Mick Power, Royal Holloway University of 
London</B>
<LI>"The arena of cognitive-clinical psychology has been awaiting the entrance of a book such as 
this for some time. ...an extremely valuable contribution to a growing area." <B>Tim Dalgleish, 
Institute of Psychiatry</B>
<LI>"This book represents a most impressive achievement. It is clearly the most sophisticated 
cognitive account of depression available, and the first to be integrated with a general model of 
cognitive functioning." <B>Chris Brewin, Royal Holloway University of London
</B><LI>"This thought provoking text describes a cognitive model which attempts to encompass all 
aspects of information processing in depression. This is a feat that current explanations have been 
unable to achieve." <B>Lynn B. Myers in The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.
</B></UL>
<BR>
Moods can powerfully bias what we think, remember, and perceive. This book focuses on the negative 
cognitive biases and thought patterns associated with depressed mood and addresses the questions: How is 
depressive thought to be explained? What is its role in the origins, maintenance, and treatment of clinical 
depression? Can experimental findings provide insights that complement and extend clinically derived 
cognitive models and therapies of depression?<BR>
<BR>
A review of clinical, experimental, and theoretical approaches to understanding depressive thinking points 
to the inadequacies of existing explanatory accounts. The authors describe a radically new approach that 
overcomes these difficulties - Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS). ICS provides a comprehensive 
framework for understanding cognitive-affective interaction and change. This approach recognises 
qualitatively different kinds of information that have different relationships to affect. In particular, ICS 
distinguishes between two levels of meaning, one specific, the other more holistic and suggests that only 
the more holistic level of meaning is directly linked to affect. This distinction enables ICS to provide an 
integrative account of the findings of experimental studies of mood-dependent cognition. It is also 
important in explaining the contrast between "hot" and "cold" cognition, "knowing with the head" versus 
"knowing with the heart", and in understanding central aspects of psychotherapeutic change. ICS is 
illustrated by application to studies of mood effects on memory and judgement, to negative thought 
production and its role in the maintenance of depression, and to cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy. As 
well as providing a review of the current state of empirical and theoretical work in mood-dependent 
cognition, this book offers a new theoretical approach of wide relevance to understanding the interaction of 
cognition and emotion in both normal and clinical conditions.<BR>

<I>Mathematical Cognition</I> is a new journal launched in 1995, published by <I>The Psychology 
Press</I>. Mathematics is fundamental to how we understand the world, and, increasingly, it is 
fundamental to how we understand ourselves. The aim of <I>Mathematical Cognition</I> is to provide a 
forum for explorations of how we, as human beings,  understand mathematics: how we acquire 
mathematical concepts, and use them. We expect and encourage work from diverse fields of study.<BR>
<BR>
It is our policy not only to publish work from cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, 
neuropsychology and education, but also to encourage contributions which further our understanding of the 
cognitive processes of mathematics from students of animal behaviour, ethnographers, anthropologists and 
sociologists of mathematics, from mathematicians and from philosophers.<BR>
<BR>
Journals readers and journal editors of course expect the highest technical standards in the articles, but they 
also expect articles to be written in a way that researchers from other disciplines can understand. To assist 
in this process, special review articles will be commissioned, that will summarise and highlight research 
developments in a particular topic so that researchers from other areas can quickly and easily bring 
themselves up to date. Special issues are planned that will bring together different approaches to a key 
topic or debate. <BR>
<BR>
It is the policy of the editors and publisher to ensure the most rapid editorial responses consistent with 
maintaining the highest scientific standards. Our production schedules are therefore designed to implement 
the most rapid publication of accepted manuscripts. <BR>

MICHAEL R.A. CHANCE, Ed., Assisted by DONALD R. OMARK<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Primates, including humans, attend to each other differentially ... in a given social order, of 
which there are two organizational modes - agonic and hedonic. The implication of these modes for 
organizational, social and therapeutic psychology are profound, as the contributions to this volume so 
richly demonstrate, and for our own individual psychology perhaps even more so." Dave Stevens 
(Self &amp  Society: European Journal of Humanistic Psychology). 
<LI>"The book convinced me that observations on primates and other animals can contribute to the 
establishment of theoretical models which are of value in clarifying the interpersonal attitudes and 
behaviour of humans. Coupled with the attachment concepts of the Bowlby School this will provide a  
valuable new dimension and unifying principle to the studies of psychology, sociology and 
psychiatry." John Birtchnell (The British Journal of Medical Psychology)
</UL>
<BR>
This book outlines a new evolutionary paradigm for understanding human society and mental structure, 
originating from the editor's work in primate ethology. It is supported and further elaborated by the 
contributors. Chance argues that two modes of social interaction, the agonic and hedonic underlie social 
life an corresponding mentality. In the agonic mode we are concerned with self security and our attention is 
much taken up with being accepted by a group. This mode is based on a recently discovered state of 
inhibited (braked) mental arousal. Social behaviour is either authoritarian or authority subservient, and has 
a tendency to control or be controlled. It curbs intelligence and restricts personality development. In the 
hedonic mode we are freer to form a network of personal relationships that are typically mutually 
supportive. The hedonic mode leads to the development of self confidence and a relaxed empathic and 
collaborative personality with intelligence enhanced. The volume will be of interest to all concerned with 
human affairs including those working in ethology, primatology, anthropology, social psychology, 
psychiatry and political sociology.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>COGNITIVE SCIENCE PROJECTS IN PROLOG</H3></CENTER>
PETER SCOTT, ROD NICOLSON (University of Sheffield) <BR>
<BR>
Cognitive Science is a new discipline which is emerging from research spanning Cognitive Psychology and 
Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics and Philosophy. The belief uniting researchers from these varied 
backgrounds is that one can learn a great deal about how people think, act and remember through the 
attempt to implement abstract, paper-theories as computer programs. In order to really learn about 
Cognitive Science research it is important to explore the existence proof of the work - the code. 
Unfortunately, many students and researchers interested in Cognitive Science lack the necessary 
programming skills to participate and even skilled programmers are hampered by lack of access to the 
classic programs themselves. This book was written to encourage the reader to learn through hands on 
experience of small-scale versions of some serious and interesting Cognitive Science projects.<BR>
<BR>
The language Prolog is an excellent choice for the Cognitive Scientist as it provides a powerful, and 
elegant declarative logic-based environment. This book is not a manual or primer for Prolog programming 
- nor does it seek to provide an even-handed or in-depth coverage of Cognitive Science. Instead it has 
sought out a number of systems that could be considered to be "classics" in the area and shows how they 
could actually work in Prolog. The novice reader is invited to tinker with the code to see how it works - the 
expert reader is expected to extend and improve it. The book is based on an undergraduate course taught to 
Psychologists and Cognitive Scientists at the University of Sheffield. Three of the projects are related to 
understanding natural language: a pattern matcher; a syntax-based grammar; and a semantics-based 
understander. The remaining projects explore three other important areas: planning and search; semantic 
networks and frames; and production systems. It should prove valuable to any student of Cognitive Science 
and any academic wishing to teach courses in Cognitive Science.<BR>

<B>USHA GOSWAMI, (Cambridge University) PETER BRYANT (Oxford University)</B><BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>~ Goswami and Bryant assemble an impressive number of research studies which bear on their 
thesis, outlining them clearly and succinctly. They write persuasively but never dogmatically, 
revealing a refreshing willingness to give credit to theoretical positions other than their own. This 
book deserves serious attention by all those who are keen to relate the practice of the teaching of 
reading to theory which is firmly grounded in careful empirical work.~ Katherine Perera, (The Times 
Higher Education Supplement).
<LI>~I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this monograph...The argument is a delight...This will be a 
very valuable contribution to thinking about the role of phonological processing in reading and in 
learning to read, but it will also be usable as an undergraduate text. I shall certainly consider using it 
to support my own course on Reading and Understanding.~ Professor Geoffrey Underwood (Reader 
in Cognitive Psychology, University of Nottingham)
<LI>~This book really gives one the feeling that progress has been made. The meticulous stock-
taking evident in the extensive literature review has brought this out. The great puzzle of the phoneme 
in literacy is virtually solved. The hunt for this solution has been one of the most exciting enterprises 
in psychology today. Moreover, it has brought developmental psychology into direct contact with 
educational practice. This book is scholarly yet clear, didactic yet fun to read. It can be recommended 
to anybody who has ever wondered how children learn to read...I am wholly enthusiastic about this 
book, and I believe that it will be much in demand as a set course book.~ Dr Uta Frith (MRC 
Cognitive Development Unit, London)
<LI>~I think this is an excellent and timely book. It has been a pleasure reviewing it.~ Dr Charles 
Hulme (Reader inPsychology, University of York)
<LI>~Perhaps the real contribution of this attractive monograph is that it offers a new 
conceptualisation of the relationship between speech and literacy which can give an exciting direction 
for future research~ P.H.K. Seymour (Professor of Cognitive Psychology, University if Dundee) in 
The Times Higher Educational Supplement.
</UL>
<BR>
This book sets out to integrate recent exciting research on the precursors of reading and early reading 
strategies adopted by children in the classroom. It aims to develop a theory about why early phonological 
skills are crucial in learning to read, and shows how phonological knowledge about rhymes and other units 
of sound helps children learn about lettersequences when beginning to be taught to read.  The authors begin 
by contrasting theories which suggest that children's phonological awareness is a result of the experience of 
learning to read and those that suggest that phonological awareness precedes, and is a causal determinant 
of, reading. The authors argue for a version of the second kind of theory and show that children are aware 
of speech units, called onset and rime, before they learn to read and spell. An important part of the 
argument is that children make analogies and inferences about these letter sequences in order to read and 
write new words. <BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY OF 
SCHIZOPHRENIA</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
DAVID G. KINGDON, DOUGLAS TURKINGTON (Bassetlaw Hospital, Nottinghamshire)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreword by Aaron T. Beck</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>"This book will give a `shot in the arm' to clinicians interested in working with psychotic 
patients ... When I first started using and talking about cognitive therapy in the early 1960s, I thought 
that this therapy would be largely limited to patients with various neuroses, such as depression, 
anxiety disorder, phobias, and the like. When professionals at seminars and conferences asked me to 
state conditions for which cognitive therapy was not indicated, I would say `Schizophrenia'. It is a 
pleasant surprise now to see that I was wrong - cognitive therapy does have a direct application to this 
disorder ... It is my expectation that the present volume will make this approach available to a vast 
army of mental health workers who are struggling with the difficult problems of this disorder, and at 
the same time, will provide new hope for patients with schizophrenia." - From the Foreword by Aaron 
T. Beck
<LI>"...there are many useful ideas and comments which will stimulate the interests of clinicians in 
this area. Much of the work described would improve the quality of relationships with patients, even 
if systematic cognitive behavioural therapy is not attempted. For that reason I would recommend this 
book very highly to all professionals working with people with psychosis." Psychological Medicine, 
1995; Reviewed by Philippa Garety
<LI>"The authors have developed an important approach to the psychological and social treatment of 
people with schizophrenia. The book is extremely well written and draws impressively from a wide 
range of valuable data." - John S. Strauss
<LI>"Our understanding of the biological basis of schizophrenic illnesses has expanded rapidly in 
recent years. Antipsychotic medications remain the mainstay of treatment, but many people suffering 
from schizophrenia can also benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy. Drs. Kingdon and Turkington 
provide an excellent review of the theoretical background of these treatments as well as useful 
illustrations of these techniques in operation. Cognitive-behavioral treatments have replaced the older, 
and largely invalid, psychoanalytical approaches to the psychological treatment of psychosis. The 
addition of these new psychological techniques to our improved pharmacological therapies provides 
considerable hope for the schizophrenia sufferer." - Robin M. Murray, M.D. D.Sc
</UL>
<BR>
Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been successfully employed in the treatment of such problems as 
depression, panic disorder, and phobias. Now, providing a promising approach to patients with the most 
intractable problems, this book details the practical application of cognitive-behavioral therapy to the 
pervasive disorder of schizophrenia. The techniques described  in this book, drawn from relevant theory 
and research, are designed to complement other treatments for schizophrenia, including medication, 
rehabilitation, and family therapies. Making a clear distinction between the diagnosis of schizophrenia and 
the debilitating label of insanity, the authors contend that people with this disorder are not inherently 
irrational but, instead suffer from a circumscribed set of irrational beliefs. The book presents easily learned 
techniques that professionals can employ to help patients alleviate the impact of these beliefs, and start 
drawing upon the strengths and rationality they do possess to improve their daily lives.<BR>
<BR>
Illustrated with numerous case examples, the book describes how to:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>work with the person to construct credible explanations of distressing and disabling symptoms
<LI>Explore the personal significance of life events and circumstances and their interactions with the 
person's strengths and vulnerabilities
<LI>Introduce reality testing for hallucinations and delusions
<LI>Disentangle thought disorder and ameliorate negative symptoms
<LI>Demystify psychotic symptoms for individuals and their families
<LI>It also clearly delineates the relationship of thought, identity, insight, and coping strategies to 
schizophrenia. 
</UL>
<BR>
An invaluable resource for all professionals working with people suffering from schizophrenia - from 
psychologists, psychiatrists, and residential care workers to social workers, occupational therapists, and 
nursing staff - this practical and accessible text is also essential reading for students in these fields.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>"In an interesting introductory chapter, the editors undertake what is probably the first-ever 
state-of-the-art survey of activities, funding, and difficulties identified by memory specialists from 
Europe and the US. This book, probably better than any other single work, offers a commanding view 
of more than one hundred years of effort in memory research." <B>R.G. Crowder (Yale University)

</B></UL>
<BR>
This book brings together some of the most influential researchers currently working in the area of 
memory. Individual chapters cover a wide range of key areas of memory research, but throughout the 
book, the main emphasis is on theoretical issues, how they relate to existing empirical work and what 
implications they have for future work in the area. Topics covered include: the development of different 
memory abilities; the case for different subsystems in memory; and the structure of different memory 
subsystems. Different views on the level of explanation offered by these theories of memory are discussed. 
Not only do the contributions reveal diversity in the theoretical concerns within memory research, they also 
illustrate a considerable range in the type of evidence that is brought to bear on these concerns. The 
diversity within the book reflects the vigour of modern research into memory and shows how it continues 
to be an important research area. Theories of Memory provides a unique state-of-the-art perspective on this 
key aspect of cognitive psychology.<BR>

<TITLE>HUMAN MEMORY</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>HUMAN MEMORY</H3>
<H3>Theory and Practice</H3></CENTER>
<B>A.D. BADDELEY (Director, MRC Applied Psychology Unit,  Cambridge)</B><BR>
<BR>
This undergraduate text presents a view of current research on human memory that relates traditional 
laboratory-based work to the rich and growing body of evidence from the study of memory in everyday 
life and in the clinic. The text has three parallel strands; First, an account of what laboratory-based studies 
have told us about the structure and function of human memory, and how theories are developed and 
tested. This includes a clear exposition of the relationship between theory development and experimental 
data and involves a detailed description of key experiments. The links with theories of learning based on 
conditioning in animals are also explored, particularly the practical implications of such work for the 
modification of habits and the treatment of emotional disorders. The methods of Artificial Intelligence and 
Connectionist models of memory based on Parallel Distributed Processing approaches to cognition are 
considered. The second strand of the book is rather less conventional, approaching the analysis of human 
memory by starting with the problems people encounter in the world, and using these to motivate an 
interest in the study of memory in the laboratory. The third strand that runs through the book is concerned 
with the breakdown of memory in brain-damaged patients. In addition to work on amnesic patients Human 
Memory uses neuropsychological data in order to demonstrate the everyday importance of memory, and 
includes detailed description of individual patients with memory deficits of various types. The account 
covers both the theoretical implications of the various deficits and the light they throw on the importance of 
memory in everyday life. Finally the question is raised of how psychology can help the patients using 
specific case histories to illustrate the range of single-case and group treatment designs that are now being 
applied. The book is aimed at a university or college student taking a course in human memory, but 
assumes that memory lies at the centre of cognition. Consequently the links between memory and attention, 
perception, action and emotion are stressed, making it a useful core text for a more general course on 
cognitive psychology. Human Memory aims to teach aspects of human learning and memory that will be 
useful to readers both in understanding their own memory, and in providing a background for a range of 
possible subsequent courses which might involve education, law, medicine or any of a range of social 
sciences. <BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>" It is written in an unusually lucid and entertaining way, while nevertheless managing to 
grapple with important theoretical issues. This is an unusual skill (at least among academic 
psychologists!) Secondly, Baddeley appears to have fewer theoretical axes to grind than many writers 
of academic books. As a consequence, he succeeds in presenting balanced evaluations of the theories 
and experiments he discusses." <B>M.W. Eysenck (Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, 
University of London) in British Journal of Psychology.

<B>A Developmental Approach to the Simulation of the Mind</B></CENTER><BR>

<BR>
This book is about the conduct of cognitive science, rather than what cognitive science is.  The objectives 
of the book are essentially three. Firstly, the book describes the birth of cognitive science. Secondly, it 
outlines the method of inquiry which characterizes cognitive science, and through which it is defined. The 
method employed is constructivistic, and is carried out by means of the techniques of artificial intelligence, 
relying on the assumption that mental activity is in principle reproducible by a computer program. Thirdly, 
the book describes the state of the art in the relevant domains, with a particular attention to application 
fields like pedagogics, human/machine interaction and psychotherapy. The developmental approach is 
emphasised and each chapter highlights the fact that developmental aspects are essential to comprehend the 
steady mode of functioning that is achieved once a person has reached total maturity.<BR>
<BR>
Cognitive science is not presented as a definitive method for the analysis of the mind. However the author's 
conclusion is that it is the best of all possible methods today. The technical sections of the book are 
introduced without presuming that the reader has a greater understanding of the subject than that of a high 
school student. This means that the book is readable both by experts for its methodological and original 
parts, and by novices as a coherent critical introduction to the field. <BR>

<LI>"This book makes an elegant and concise synthesis of the major theories of developmental 
psychology, relating to cognitive and language development. This is a timely contribution with so 
much research being carried out in the socio-cognitive domain. The book is a review and as such, 
makes a good starting point from which to read in more detail about the increasingly influential 
theories of Vygotsky, for example. For students of developmental psychology, therefore this book 
may be an indispensable reference guide to the main concepts concerned with 'motherese', 
scaffolding, socio-cognitive learning and joint problem solving. It is also a valuable contribution to 
the debate into the influence of social interaction on development." M. Allerton in The International 
Journal of Early Childhood. 
<LI>"The book has its roots in the tradition of developmental psychology, but also incorporates a 
good deal of research conducted by linguists. It is one of the strengths of the book that it manages to 
bridge the gap between these two disciplines, to combine research findings relating to cognitive and 
linguistic development, and effectively to chart a portion of interdisciplinary territory." Clare Tarplee

DOMINICK SANDRA (University of Antwerp), MARCUS TAFT (University of New South Wales) 
Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The main concern of the contributions in this issue is whether morphemes play a role in the lexical 
representation and processing of several types of poly-morphemic words and, more particularly, at what 
precise representational and processing level. The book comprises two theoretical contributions and a 
number of empirical ones. One theoretical paper discusses several possible motivations for a 
morphologically organised mental lexicon and lays out the weaknesses that are associated with some of 
these motivations (like the economy of representation view, and the efficiency of processing view). The 
other theoretical papers offer an interactive-activation re-interpretation of the findings that were originally 
reported within the lexical search framwork. The empirical papers cover together a relatively broad array 
of language types and mainly deal with visual word recognition in normals in the context of lexical 
morphology (derived and compound words). Evidence is reported on the function of stems and affixes as 
processing units in prefixed and suffixed derivations. The role of semantic transparency in the lexical 
representations of compounds is studied, as is the effect of orthographic ambiguity on the parsing of novel 
compounds. The inflectional-derivational distinction is approached in the context of Finnish, a highly 
agglutinative language with a much richer morphology than the languages usually studied in 
psycholinguistic experiments on plymorphemic words. Two other contributions also approach the study 
object in the context of relatively unchartered domains: one presents data on Chinese, a language which 
uses a different script-type (logographic) from the languages that are usually studied (alphabetic script), 
and another one presenting data on language production.<BR>

<B>ROBIN FIVUSH (Emory University, Atlanta) Ed.</B><BR>
<BR>
This special issue of Memory brings together some of the most exciting new research on infant memory. 
Using innovative research designs, the five studies presented here are addressing questions of central 
importance to understanding the development of human memory. In particular, the studies seek to discover 
whether, and if so under what conditions, memories of events experienced during infancy are retained over 
the preschool years. Research questions include how long retention of early memories may persist, what 
form these memories may take, the role of language and language development, and the role of intervening 
experience in the retention of early memories. The results provide provocative evidence that experiences 
occurring even during the first year of life may be retained in some form for at least several years. 
However, much of this memory is expressed more as familiarity than as explicit recall. The researchers and 
commentator present different theoretical views about what these results mean and the conclusions we may 
or may not be able to draw. Although many questions remain unanswered, the researchers contributing to 
this volume are on the edge of making important new discoveries about human memory and its 
development.<BR>

R. PETER HOBSON (University of London)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"...the author presents a new and intriguing theory of human development...This book requires 
attention from all those interested in the theoretical basis of normal child development and especially 
those who also have an interest in autism...this is a valuable and thought provoking account. It 
challenges contemporary theories of child psychology and is sure to stimulate further discussion in 
the literature." <B>John Swettenham in Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 1994.
</B><LI>"This is a very important book. Researchers who study the social perception and cognition 
of typical children often make reference to children with autism, and researchers who study children 
with autism often make reference to typical children. But this is the first major attempt to address 
these very important issues across the two populations systematically. It is now the definitive work in 
the area.... a wonderful book. It is one of the more insightful analyses in the newly emerging area of 
study concerned with how children understand their social worlds and the many ramifications that this 
understanding has for their cognitive and social lives. And the author's first hand knowledge of 
autistic children gives it a unique flavor. It will be the jumping off point for all future analyses." 
<B>Michael Tomasello (Associate Professor at Emory University, Atlanta)
</B></UL>
<BR>
The purpose of this essay is to illustrate how the phenomena of early childhood autism may cast light on 
issues that are central to our understanding of normal child development - issues such as the emotional 
origins of social experience and social understanding, the contribution of interpersonal relations to the 
genesis of symbolism and creative thought, and the role of intersubjectivity in the development of self. 
Drawing upon philosophical writings as well as empirical research on autism, the author challenges the 
individualistic and cognitive bias of much current developmental psychology, and argues that early human 
development is founded upon a normal infant's capacity for distinct forms of 'I - Thou' and 'I - It' 
relatedness. To a large degree, autism may represent the psycho-pathological sequelae to biologically- 
based incapacities for social perception and interpersonal engagement.<BR>

P.G HEPPER (The Queen's University of Belfast) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
The ontogenesis of behaviour has aroused considerable debate for many centuries. Recently 
methodological and technological advances have enabled the study of behaviour before birth and the past 
few years have seen a resurgence of interest in exploring the origins of behaviour. These studies have 
demonstrated that the developing organism is influenced by its environment before birth, these influences 
affect behaviour after birth and are important for the development of the individual. Perhaps most startling 
is that these prenatal influences are not only found in mammals but have been documented in birds, 
amphibians and invertebrates. <BR>
<BR>
This volume brings together the latest studies and reviews from a number of leading researchers to 
illustrate the importance of prenatal influences for later behaviour and to demonstrate the learning and 
behavioural abilites of a variety of species. The volume provides invaluable information on the origins of 
behaviour and the influence of prenatal factors on later development, as such it will be invaluable to 
students and researchers alike, interested in behaviour and its development.<BR>

ALAN M. SLATER (Washington Singer Laboratories, Exeter University), J. GAVIN BREMNER (Fylde 
College, Lancaster University), Eds.<BR>
<BR>
The book provides detailed up to date and authoritative accounts of major areas of infant development. The 
11 chapters are subdivided into three sections: Perceptual Development (4 chapters); Cognitive 
Development (3 chapters); Social Interaction, Early Language and Emotion (4 chapters). While written by 
different contributors the book is a well-integrated account of current developments in our understanding 
of infant development. Integration of the chapters is assisted by the editors' linking sections which 
introduce each of the three major sections of the book.<BR>
<BR>
The book begins with an account of the development of basic visual functions in early infancy and of 
visual memory and perceptual capabilities of the infant. This is followed by recent research into infants' 
ability to detect and respond to events and encounters, a theme which emphasises the continuity of 
perceptual and cognitive development. Cognitive development is further pursued by an account of the 
complex area of object permanence, and the development of spatial awareness, and how infants learn to 
solve problems. In the final section early social and language development are explored. Infants learn 
language in a social context and the social structuring of infant cognition and language is next considered. 
The final chapter considers the role of emotion in infant development from a psychoanalytic perspective. 
The book presupposes no detailed knowledge of infancy on the part of the reader, but at the same time the 
reader is guided to an understanding of the topical and lively controversies that represent the current state 
of the art and which make the field of infant development such a lively and interesting area of study.<BR>

MIND</H3>
<B>Origins and Development</B></CENTER><BR>
CHARLIE LEWIS (Lancaster University) PETER MITCHELL  (University College, Swansea) 
Eds.<BR>
<BR>
A major feature of human intelligence is that it allows us to contemplate mental life. Such an understanding 
is vital in enabling us to function effectively in social groups, and the early origins of this understanding 
form the central theme running throughout this book. The five sections represent contributions from 
different perspectives on the important factors in the development of an understanding of mind. These 
involve placing human development within an evolutionary context, which focuses on the possibility of 
innate components of understanding. <BR>
<BR>
There is also consideration to the role of early perception, pretence and communication, with special 
attention to how these kinds of experiences build upon any preexisting knowledge of mind. Additionally, 
attention is given to the possibility that children know a good deal more about the mind than is apparent 
from many studies devised to probe this. Taken together, the chapters in this book mark a first attempt 
within a 'theory of mind' movement, to examine a group of skills in infancy and early childhood which 
culminates in a more mature understanding of one's own and others' mental states towards the end of the 
preschool period. The book brings together researchers with diverse theoretical positions, who work 
towards a coherent and unified grasp of the child's understanding of mind.<BR>

MARC EISENSTADT (Open University, Milton Keynes) MARK KEANE (University of Dublin), TIM 
RAJAN (Lloyd's Register of Shipping)<BR>
<BR>
This book encapsulates ten years of research at the Open University's Human Cognition Research 
Laboratory. The research investigates the problems of novice programmers, and is strongly oriented toward 
the design and implementation of programming environments aimed at eliminating or easing novice's 
problems. A range of languages is studied: Pascal, SOLO, Lisp and Prolog. The primary emphasis of the 
empirical studies is to gain some understanding of novices' mental models of the inner workings of 
computers. Such (erroneous) models are constructed by novices in their own heads to account for the 
idiosyncrasies of particular programming languages. The primary emphasis of the implementations 
described in the book is the provision of automatic debugging aids, i.e. artificial intelligence programs 
which can analyse novices' buggy programs, and make sense of them, thereby providing useful remedial 
advice. Another related strand taken in some of the work is the concept of pre-emptive design, i.e. the 
provision of tools such as syntax-directed editors and graphical tracers which help programmers avoid 
many frequently-occurring errors. <BR>
<BR>
A common thread throughout the book is its Cognitive Science/Artificial Intelligence orientation. AI tools 
are used, for instance, to construct simulation models of subjects writing programs, in order to provide 
insights into what their deep conceptual errors are. At the other extreme, AI  programs which we developed 
in order to help students debug their programs are observed empirically in order to ensure that we have 
provided facilities actually needed by real programmers. This book will be of great interest to advanced 
undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional researchers in Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence, and 
Human-Computer Interaction.<BR>

<BR>
A growing body of research suggests that there is a specific cognitive deficit in the retrieval of proper 
names as compared with the retrieval of object names and other words. This special issue brings together 
studies that analyse the nature of retrieval failure for proper names and evaluate whether a common 
memory system can adequately account for therepresentation and retrieval of both proper and common 
names. The contributions reflect experimental, ecological, developmental, neuropsychological and 
computational approaches.<BR>

SYNDROME</H3></CENTER>
<B>ALAN J. PARKIN, NICHOLAS R.C LENG (University of Sussex)</B><BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"In summary, this is an excellent synthesis of clinical, theoretical and empirical literature on the 
amnesic syndrome. The book will be of interest to a broad audience including researchers, clinical 
neuropsychologists, and university faculty who teach courses on memory disorders." <B>Glenn J. 
Larrabee in Contemporary Psychology, 1994</B>.
<LI>"Parkin and Leng's text on the Neuropsychology of the Amnesic Syndrome accurately portrays 
the "state of the art" for research on the amnesic syndrome as a function of aetiology. Few authors 
have attempted such a documentation, so the effort should be much appreciated by investigators of 
this neurological disorder." <B>Laird S. Cermak in Neuropsychologia, 1994</B>.
<LI>"This book provides much valuable information in an easily accessible form for both clinicians 
and researchers. Its attempt to play to both audiences is to be applauded and its weaknesses simply 
reflect the wider problem that neuropsychology faces in trying to put theory into practice." <B>Alan 
Sunderland (University of Leicester) in The Psychologist, 1994</B>.
<LI>"Overall this book can certainly be recommended as a useful and clear introduction to the 
psychology of amnesic syndromes. As such it fills a definite gap and deserves to be widely read by 
members of the various disciplines concerned with the problem of amnesia and not just 
psychologists." <B>E. Miller in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 
1993</B>.
<LI>"[The authors] have succeeded in producing an eminently readable and well-organised guide to 
the understanding of a complex subject... I am sure it will become a valuable resource for 
undergraduates, researchers, and clinicians." <B>Janet Cockburn (McDonnell-Pew Centre for 
Cognitive Neuroscience and Rivermead Rehabilitation Centre) in Neuropsychological 
Rehabilitation, 1994</B>.
<LI>"Overall, this book manages to integrate clinical and theoretical issues in memory research in a 
most skilful way. In my view it is most appropriate and readable for students as well for clinicians 
with special interest in the neuropsychology of memory. Irrespective of the numerous publications in 
this field, it is not easy to find a well- organized, high level book with not too many confusing details 
for beginners. In addition, this book is an enjoyable reading experience at a more advanced level, too.

<BR>
This book provides the clinician, researcher, and student with a comprehensive account of the 
neuropsychology of the amnesic syndrome. The opening chapter places the amnesic syndrome within the 
overall context of memory disorders and provides a theoretical basis for understanding the presentation of  
the clinical and experimental findings which form the major part of the work. The second chapter provides 
an extensive account of the various methods used to assess memory and associated deficits and provides 
guidelines as to the most effective assessment strategy. The next five chapters are concerned with the 
specific aetiologies giving rise to the amnesic syndrome: Wernicke- Korsakoff Syndrome; Thalamic 
Amnesia; Medial Temporal Lobe Amnesia; Herpes Simplex Encephalitis; and ruptured aneurysms of the 
anterior communicating artery. Each of these chapters contains an account of the associated  
neuropathology, descriptions of experimental findings and illustrative case histories from the authors' own 
experimental and clinical experience. <BR>
<BR>
The next chapter provides the reader with an account of some of the more important scientific issues that 
have arisen from studies of the amnesic syndrome and a final chapter considers current and future 
prospects for behavioural remediation of severe memory deficit. <BR>

<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"It includes a wealth of clinical examples which illustrate the spectrum of the disorders, and with 
which the sufferer may identify...This book does not claim to be a cure, but says it "can help you get 
much better, so that the eating disorder doesn't rule your life anymore". It is clearly and directly 
written, from a wealth of practical experience, and does indeed provide the sufferer with a "survival 
kit" on the road to recovery. It can be recommended, not only to sufferers, but to professionals 
dealing with these patients, and to family and friends who wish to become involved in the recovery 
process." Behaviour Research and Therapy, 1994; Reviewed by Anne Ward 
<LI>"This is an excellent book, and a model for self- help manuals. The basics of bulimia nervosa 
and other binge eating disorders are explained in clear, simple language. The suggested ways for self-
help are carefully described, with examples. Essential information about food, the body,  dieting, the 
ill-effects of vomiting and laxative abuse, is given. Areas of life that need to be looked into and 
modified in a comprehensive approach to these problems are discussed. Further readings, attractive 
and funny cartoons, and detailed practical advice with regard to how achieve one's aim, add to what 
the book has to offer...a splendid publication." Sexual and Marital Therapy, 1994; Reviewed by P. de 
Silva
<LI>"Well-motivated adults and older adolescents with mild to moderate disorders will find this book 
valuable ... Therapists will find it helpful either by incorporating some of its suggestions into their 
own practice, or recommending as reading to their clients." - Journal of Adolescence
</UL>
<BR>
Many women's lives are blighted by the widespread physical and psychological problems caused by eating 
disorders, such as bulimia nervosa and a wide range of allied conditions. Ignorance or misinformation 
about the causes, health risks and remedies abounds. Access to treatment is difficult for many sufferers, 
and friends and families often feel impotent. This self-help book, whose efficacy has been proven in 
clinical trials, empowers sufferers to take control of their own lives and tackle their eating difficulties in 
their own home.  Easy to read and illustrated with many real-life examples, this book addresses the specific 
problems faced on a daily basis by Bulimia sufferers. Based on the most recent research, and the only self-
help program that has been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial, it provides detailed step-by-step 
advice for dealing with this condition. Unlike other less problem-oriented books currently available on the 
subject, this book concentrates on the key behaviour changes necessary for the sufferer to achieve a 
happier and more fulfilled life. Theory is closely interwoven with practice and the book draws together real 
problems and solutions experienced by hundreds of sufferers. <BR>
<BR>
Issues covered in depth include: How to cope with binges, cravings and urges; the health risks of dieting; 
How to achieve an optimal weight; Vomiting, laxatives and diuretics: how to give up; How to get fitter; 
The wounds of childhood; Faulty thinking; Assertiveness; The slippery slope of drink and drugs; 
Relationships and bulimia; Common work problems; How to cope with set-backs. Getting Better Bit(e) by 
Bit(e) will be a major source of help to eating disorder sufferers and their friends and families.  About the 
authors: Doctors Ulrike Schmidt and Janet Treasure  are psychiatrists who work in the Eating Disorders 
Unit at the Maudsley Hospital in London, one of the largest specialist clinics for treating Bulimia Nervosa 
in Europe.  <BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>SOCIO-COGNITIVE MANAGEMENT OF 
INFORMATION PROCESSING IN CHILDREN</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of the International Journal of Psychology</B></CENTER><BR>
FAJDA WINNYKAMEN, JANINE BEAUDICHON (Universite Rene Descartes, Paris)<BR>
<BR>
The texts presented here cover three themes: Cognitive control of information processing, socio-cognitive 
management of information in the social domain and the development of socio- cognitive abilities. 
Altogether, these texts mark an advancement in the field of socio-cognitive development and functioning 
because they are representative of European research in this domain. <BR>
<BR>
Meta-cognitive aspects of learning how to read theories of mind, the development of understanding false 
beliefs and the distinction appearance/reality constitute the first theme. The second theme groups together 
ideas from the Geneva School of social development of intelligence. This theme concerns recent 
developments in concepts of socio-cognitive conflict and of social marking. It includes, not only analyses 
of how children manage seeking help from others when confronted with a difficulty they cannot solve on 
their own, but also the study of taking charge, monitoring, and communication between interlocutors.<BR>
<BR>
The third theme involves research on relations between maternal scaffolding and cognitive capacities 
during the first year and the functional value of the preverbal period and the period of motor dependency. 
Research on how imagination works and plays a role in deductive reasoning is also included. The 
outstanding characteristic of this presentation is the diversity and complementarity of the various 
approaches which are also supported by empirical data.  <BR>

<TITLE>SPSS FOR WINDOWS MADE SIMPLE</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3>SPSS FOR WINDOWS MADE SIMPLE</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
PAUL R. KINNEAR, COLIN D. GRAY (University of Aberdeen)<BR>
<BR>
"SPSS for Windows Made Simple is very good value ofr money; the best SPSS for Windows for 
psychologists so far and will be difficult to beat. With SPSS for Windows Made Simple all the elements 
now exist for teaching an undergraduate statistics course in psychology without tears." Psychology  
Teaching Review, September 1995<BR>
<BR>
Like its predecessor SPSS/PC+ Made Simple, SPSS for Windows Made Simple is the product of many 
years of teaching experience. There is an abundance of worked examples, which include annotated SPSS 
output listings and actual screen images of windows, icons and dialog boxes. These are accompanied by 
comments clarifying the points that have arisen most frequently from students' queries during practical 
classes.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the book, is a complete course of practical exercises in statistical computing with SPSS for 
Windows, covering all the topics considered in the text; indeed, the opportunity is frequently taken to 
expand upon some points merely touched upon in the chapters themselves. As the title suggests, a premium 
has been placed upon simplicity rather than comprehensiveness. Nevertheless, the range of problems and 
techniques covered is much wider than in comparable introductory texts.<BR>
<BR>
The first five chapters introduce the reader to some basic terms from computing, research methodology and 
Windows, and describe the use of SPSS to explore a data set thoroughly. There is also some advice on the 
selection of statistical tests. The remaining chapters are relatively self-contained, each dealing with a 
particular test or procedure, with preliminary comments about its use and the conditions that must be 
satisfied for its correct application. In summary, SPSS for Windows Made Simple: Introduces the reader, 
with a minimum of fuss and detail, to Windows and the basics of SPSS operation in a graphics 
environment  Shows how to get the most out of a set of data  Offers cautions and caveats about the misuse 
of computing packages and statistics  Advises on the choice of a statistical test  Covers a much wider range 
of topics than other introductory texts  Illustrates techniques with fully annotated SPSS output  Makes 
extensive use of screen images  Contains an abundance of worked examples  Includes a course of practical 
exercises  Has a useful and comprehensive index  <BR>

</B><BR>
The papers in this series of five volumes provide a snapshot of current trends in European Cognitive 
Science. Each of the volumes deals with problems in cognitive science from a different perspective, 
covering the interacting disciplines of cognitive psychology, logic and linguistics, human-computer 
interaction, neuroscience and artificial intelligence respectively. <BR>
<BR>
Linguistics is concerned with the structure and use of languages, and logic with the form and correctness of 
argumentation in ordinary and scientific language. The two fields are presented with respect to their role in 
cognitive science and artificial intelligence: How are they realised by psychological mechanisms or 
biological processes on the one hand or programmed or wired in machines on the other. The contributions 
in this volume give introductions to the state-of-the-art, emphasizing the analysis of complexity and 
flexibility in logic and language in the framework of classical approaches (Chapters 3, 4, 5, 7). At the same 
time some contributions present a broader perspective in which an integration of the formal structure with 
the structure of the processing systems might be possible (Chapters 2 &amp  6). In this context, the 
differences and the perspectives of the classical approaches on the one hand and of connectionist 
approaches on the other are compared. (Chapters 1 &amp  6).<BR>

<B>A Special Issue of Neuropsychological Rehabilitation</B><BR>
GEORGE PRIGATANO (Barrow Neurological Institute, Arizona USA) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
The neuropsychological literature on the effects of early brain injury has progressively expanded. There 
has been, however, relatively little work on the question of how to rehabilitate a child who has suffered a 
disturbance in higher cerebral functions. The early literature by such innovative researchers as Birch helped 
document the complexity of this problem. <BR>
<BR>
This Special Issue focuses on a more contemporary view of the effects of acquired brain dysfunction on 
children as well as providing specific guidelines that might be relevant to their education and rehabilitation. 
The contributors of this issue consist of psychologists, educators, speech and language pathologists, and 
physicians. The attempt is to provide information concerning various types of brain injury and how they 
affect neuropsychological and psychosocial outcome. The better one understands the nature of these 
disturbances, the easier it will be to develop rehabilitation programs that specifically deal with their higher 
cerebral dysfunctions and associated psychosocial difficulties.<BR>

<TITLE>THE MULTILINGUAL COMMUNITY</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>THE MULTILINGUAL COMMUNITY</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of the European Journal of Cognitive Psychology on Bilingualism</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
A. DE GROOT (University of Amsterdam), C. BARRY (University of Wales College of Cardiff) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
This special issue contains seven articles on experimental studies in bilingualism. Together they reflect the 
diversity of approaches taken by researchers in the field and the range of theoretical issues they have 
addressed. An introduction by the editors discusses and integrates the results of these studies.<BR>
<BR>
Five of the contributions deal with various aspects of bilingual word representation, approaching the topic 
from different angles, and together using a large variety of experimental tasks. A central question in these 
studies is whether the bilinguals' knowledge of their two languages is stored in an integrated or a 
segregated way. Not all authors arrive at the same conclusion, but it appears that controversy can be 
resolved by assuming that bilingual word representation differs both across groups of bilinguals and across 
individual words; bilingual memories may distribute themselves along a continuum from a fully segregated 
system to a fully integrated system. <BR>
<BR>
The two remaining studies deal with second-language acquisition. In one of them, the authors look at the 
influence of learners' general language skill, as evidenced by their native-language proficiency, on their 
second-language proficiency. The last study investigates the 'optimal-age' hypothesis, which claims that 
young children have a special facility for learning languages. The studies reported in the special issue will 
be of interest to academics, especially cognitive psychologists and students of language, and also to those 
involved in education and second language learning.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>PRINCIPLES OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY</H3>
<BR>
NICKY HAYES (School of Human &amp  Health Sciences, University of Huddersfield) <BR>
<BR>
Principles of Social Psychology is a clear and readable introduction to social psychology, which will be 
ideal for students with little prior knowledge of the area. It is suitable for A-level psychology students, for 
those studying psychology as a supplement to other applied courses, and for all those requiring a general 
and up to date overview of the major concerns and issues in social psychology. <BR>
<BR>
The book integrates the well-established traditional material of social psychology, such as conformity, 
attitudes and prejudice, with some of the newer insights into social life which have emerged over the past 
couple of decades, such as the study of discourse, relationships, social identity, and social representations. 
Principles of Social Psychology also incorporates a number of the themes and concerns which have 
emerged recently in social psychology. These include problems of ethnocentrism and identity, ethical 
issues in social psychology, and the challenges to conventional methodology represented by some of the 
new areas of research. The combination of established knowledge, recent theory, and significant themes 
means that this is a book which students and lecturers will find both useful and interesting.<BR>

<BR>
The special issue on educational psychology consists of five articles and an introduction by the guest 
editor. The various contributors defend the view that instruction models that are currently in vogue in 
education should undergo drastic changes, because they have outlived their usefulness. All authors agree 
that for centuries the education system has turned out students who did not master a variety of skills and 
were not able to regulate their own learning. The authors review data from different research areas within 
educational psychology, and explain what this data means for educational theory and practice. Taken 
together, the data and guidelines point in the same direction: Instructional practice should be changed, and 
educational psychology is in a position to formulate some specific advice for teachers. Drawing on 
different research traditions, and supplying empirical evidence from their own studies, all authors come to 
the conclusion that learning should be viewed as an active, goal- oriented activity, and that an important 
educational goal should be to turn students into independent learners, who value knowledge and skill 
acquisition for its own sake. Two articles deal explicitly with the role of affective variables. The authors 
defend the view that emotions are part of normal classroom life, and that they should no longer be seen as 
unwanted side-effects of the information processing system, but as instigators and inhibitors of 
behaviour.<BR>

<B>MARTIN CONWAY (University of Bristol)</B><BR>
<BR>
This book provides a state-of-the-art review and critical evaluation of research into 'flashbulb' memories. 
The opening chapters explore the 'encoding' view of flashbulb memory formation and critically appraise a 
number of lines of research that have opposed this view. It is concluded that this research does not provide 
convincing evidence for the rejection of the encoding view. Subsequent chapters review and appraise more 
recent work which has generally found in favour of the flashbulb concept. But this research too, does not 
provide unequivocal support for the encoding view of flashbulb memory formation. Evidence from clinical 
studies of flashbulb memories, particularly in post-traumatic stress disorder and related emotional 
disturbances, is then considered. The clinical studies provide the most striking evidence of flashbulb 
memories and strongly suggest that these arise in response to intense affective experiences. 
Neurobiological models of memory formation are briefly reviewed and one view suggesting that there may 
be multiple routes to memory formation is explored in detail. From this research it seems possible that 
there could be a specific route for the formation of detailed and durable memories associated with 
emotional experiences. In the final chapter a cognitive account of flashbulb memories is outlined. This 
account is centred on recent plan-based theories of emotion and proposes that flashbulb memories arise in 
responses to disruptions of personal and cultural plans. This chapter also considers the wider functions of 
flashbulb memories and their potential role in the formation of generational identity.<BR>

Cognitive Analysis</H3></CENTER>
Andrew W. Ellis (University of York)<BR>
<BR>
Research in cognitive psychology over the past 15 years or so has contributed much to our understanding 
of reading and spelling. Most of this work has concentrated on the processes used by literate adults to 
comprehend and produce written language, but there is a growing interest in applying cognitive theories to 
the development of literacy, and to the understanding of disorders of reading and writing. Such disorders 
may be acquired as a consequence of a brain injury to a previously literate adult, or may be developmental, 
occurring in otherwise normal children. This book is the first attempt to present this work to a non-
specialist audience. Though written primarily with students of psychology and education in mind, it is 
accessible also to parents and teachers.<BR>

This volume brings together the diverse bodies of research and theory on planning and control processes. 
The articles cover several different periods in the life span, including age-comparative and cross-cultural 
analyses. Some of the papers report empirical studies and others provide integrative theoretical reviews. 
The topics include selective optimization and compensation, goal setting, planning skills, adaptation and 
coping, primary and secondary control, and self-efficacy. <BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>THE BODY UNDER STRESS</H3>
<B>Developing Skills for Keeping Healthy</B></CENTER><BR>
ED CONDUIT (Cross Street Health Centre, Dudley)<BR>
<BR>
This book presents a model of positive health in terms of health behaviours and will be indispensable for 
health professionals who aim to develop positive health in their patients. A coherent framework for 
positive health, and access to a large body of research on methods for achieving health behaviours, is 
offered. The author proposes a model in which careful selection and development of the relevant health 
care behaviours can prevent relapses of the circulation, digestion, breathing and movement systems. <BR>
<BR>
The first half of the book concentrates on lifestyle behaviours which the individual can modify to achieve 
better control of health. The ability to manage time and plan ahead can prevent later agitation, and good 
eating habits can prevent later problems of excess. Just over two dozen such skills are postulated as "skills 
of a fit person".  Environmental demands can be altered by behaviours such as assertion and time 
management. Constructive withdrawal, and seeking comfort and support can help when coping with Life 
Events. These two approaches subsume much of what has been known historically as psychosomatic 
illness.  Food has been implicated as a contributor to many physical illnesses, and the possibilities for 
improving health through better control of food and self-administered drugs are described. Other aspects of 
lifestyle which maintain health are reviewed, including exercise, sex and some aspects of work behaviour.  
Being able to use medical services for health advice and prescriptions is also a skilled behaviour which is 
described. <BR>
<BR>
The second part of the book concentrates on maintaining organ systems. The circulatory system is 
particularly prone to psychological influences, operating through the autonomic nervous system and stress 
hormones. Stress coping skills and other lifestyle issues in the primary and secondary prevention of heart 
disease are discussed in depth. Breathing and digestion have attracted less research, and preventive health 
attention, but fit behaviours can substantially reduce illnesses of the lungs and digestive tract. There is a 
section on back care and suppleness of the body, and the related issue of activities alternative to pain. <BR>

This book has been written in the hope that some of the misconceptions surrounding head injury in 
children can be corrected. The united aim of the experts who have contributed to the book, is to combat the 
ignorance of the effects of brain trauma. It is believed that by educating the professionals and parents 
involved in child care, a greater number of children could be helped to an early and more effective 
recovery from head injury. Included in the book are "a thoughtful dissertation on cerebral plasticity after 
injury, an admirable study of recovery of speech and language deficits in head injury; a concise, 
informative account of "disorders of self- regulation"; and an illuminating discussion of psychiatric aspects 
of head injury." Colin R. Kennedy (Consultant Paediatric Neurologist, Southampton General Hospital) in

<UL>
<LI>"Harris tackles the seemingly impenetrable question of the role of caretaker speech on language 
acquisition. In an engaging and accessible style she reviews previous research on this question and 
addresses the many methodological difficulties that tend to ensue with this line of research." 
Jacqueline S. Johnson in Contemporary Psychology, 1995.
<LI>"This is an extremely important contribution to the Essays in Developmental Psychology series. 
Written in a style which is lucid and readily accessible to the non-specialist, Harris presents an 
engaging account of the processes of language development during infancy and early childhood...it 
will be read with profit by undergraduate and postgraduate students concerned to understand the role 
of early experience in language development and how it interacts with biological endowment. 
Research students in particular will find the sections on methodology extremely helpful." H. McGurk 
(Thomas Coram Research Unit, London).
</UL>
<BR>
This book is about one of the most fundamental debates on language development, namely the relationship 
between children's language development and their language experience. This issue is not only of 
theoretical interest; understanding how a child's language development is related to experience has 
important implications for children whose early language development is giving cause for concern. If there  
are no environmental influences on early development then little can be done to help the child whose first 
steps into language are faltering. But, if the speed with which children develop language is subject to some 
external influence, then there are likely to be opportunities for successful intervention and grounds for 
optimism rather than pessimism in this area. This book argues that there are grounds for optimism.  <BR>

<CENTER><H3>DEDUCTION</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
P.N. JOHNSON-LAIRD (Princeton University), R.M.J. BYRNE (Trinity College, Dublin)<BR>
<BR>
How do people make deductions? The orthodox answer to the question is that deductive reasoning depends 
on a mental logic containing formal rules of inference. The authors of this book have spent several years 
investigating the process. They repudiate the orthodox theory. They argue instead that people reason by 
imagining the relevant state of affairs, i.e. building an internal model of it, formulating a tentative 
conclusion based on this model, and then searching for alternative models that might refute the conclusion. 
Formal rules work syntactically; mental rules work semantically. The two theories therefore make different 
predictions about the difficulty of deductions. The book reports the results of experiments that compared 
these predictions in the three main domains of deduction: propositional reasoning based on connectives 
such as "if" and "or"; relational reasoning based on spatial descriptions; and complex reasoning based on 
quantifiers such as "all" and "none". In each domain, the results corroborated the model theory and ran 
counter to the use of formal rules.<BR>
<BR>
The authors relate their findings to problems in artificial intelligence, linguistics and anthropology. They 
describe various computer programs based on the model theory, including one that solves a major problem 
in the design of electronic circuits. Finally, they show how the theory resolves a long standing controversy 
about the nature of rationality and whether there are cognitive universals common to all human 
cultures.<BR>

<TITLE>FACET THEORY</TITLE>

<B>A Special Issue of Applied Psychology An International Review </B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
L. SUZANNE DANCER (University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee, USA), SYDNEY L. HANS (University of 
Chicago, USA), Eds.<BR>
<BR>
With this issue of Applied Psychology: An International Review the authors provide an introduction to 
facet theory and apply this theoretical framework to research in various areas of psychology. In essence, 
facet theory uses methods of nonmetric multidimensional scaling to examine the correspondence between 
definitional properties of a construct and structural  properties of data. Although facet theory has roots in 
Louis Guttman's writings as early as the 1950's, applications of facet analysis were not frequent until the 
1970's. In recent years facet analyses have flourished worldwide in the social and behavioral sciences. <BR>
<BR>
Papers comprising this special issue provide examples of facet analyses as applied to research in  
psychology. A study by Levy draws on the work of Rokeach and Parsons to develop a unified 
conceptualization of values . Borg's research discusses work by Maslow and Rosenberg and examines 
values in the workplace, for example values indicative of the importance of challenging work for an 
employee's personal growth. Donald and Canter investigate issues pertinent to assessment of personnel in 
the workplace. In research by Wilson and Canter, the focus is on development, over years of professional 
education, of complexity of conceptualizations of architectural style.  The role of parent-infant 
communication in the psychological development of high-risk infants is the subject of a study by Hans and 
Bernstein where they investigate dynamic, developmental processes in high-risk populations. 
Psychological adjustment and its relationship to persons at-risk for suicidal behavior are the subject of a 
study by Dancer. Collectively, these papers typify the variety of problems to which facet theory has been 
fruitfully applied, and the array of applications contributes to the uniqueness of this publication. <BR>

HARRY MCGURK (Thomas Coram Research Unit, Institute of Education, London) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"This volume would be ideal for a graduate seminar on social development, with its challenge to 
reconceptualize constructs, measures, and analyses to incorporate not only the developmental 
processes with the individual child but also the coconstructive processes within adult-child and peer 
relationships embedded within a cultural context." <B>Debra Pepler in Contemporary Psychology, 
1994</B>.
</UL>
<BR>
This book provides an account of research in action and debate in progress in a selection of areas of 
childhood social development where significant progress is underway. The chapters are written by an 
eminent group of British and American developmental psychologists each of whom has made primary 
contributions to research in the areas covered in the volume.<BR>
<BR>
The contributors were invited to reflect upon the current scene in social developmental research and to 
develop their own distinctive viewpoint and contribution to the field. The book addresses issues in social 
development from infancy to adolescence. The topics examined include: interactions between biological 
and social factors in social development; sex role development; the development of friendships; the role of 
peer interaction in social and cognitive development; and the influence of cultural artifacts in the social and 
cognitive development of children. <BR>
<BR>
Although each chapter is concerned with a different aspect of social development, there are a number of 
themes that recur throughout the volume. One concerns the nature of social development: the acquisition of 
social understanding and the development of social skills are not individual achievements of children 
reared in isolation. Rather, they are the outcome of social processes in which the developing child engages, 
sometimes in an unequal partnership with experienced adults; at other times in more equal partnership with 
peers and playmates. In both cases the development change is a constructive outcome. <BR>
<BR>
A second recurrent theme is a concern for developmental  researchers to take fuller account than they may 
traditionally have done of the nature of the cultural settings in which social development occurs. Different 
cultures have different customs and artifacts, and these can constrain development in different ways. This 
issue is considered throughout the book and is the specific focus of the final chapter. <BR>

REHABILITATION</TITLE>

<B>M. JANE RIDDOCH, GLYN W. HUMPHREYS (University of Birmingham)  Eds.</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the past 15 years there have been significant advances in cognitive analysis of many 
neuropsychological syndromes. In such analyses, investigators aim to understand cognitive deficits in 
terms of impairments to particular processes within a model of normal cognitive performance. In addition, 
evidence from cognitive impairments can be used to help  constrain theories of normal performance. 
However, until recently cognitive neuropsychological analyses had made little penetration of clinical 
rehabilitation practice. This situation is now beginning to change, though, as in several areas of study, 
clinical practitioners use cognitive modelsand cognitive neuropsychological analyses to guide both 
assessment and rehabilitation. The marrying of cognitive neuropsychology to cognitive rehabilitation offers 
great promise for producing a principled approach to rehabilitation, tailored to the cognitive deficits in 
particular patients.<BR>
<BR>
This book brings together a series of empirical and reviewpapers dealing with recent attempts to apply 
cognitiveneuropsychology to cognitive rehabilitation. The book is divided into 6 topic areas covering: 
Visual Object Recognition, Visual Attention, Motor Performance, Spoken Language and Phonological 
Skills, Written Language, and Memory. Within each topic, there is a review chapter, covering both recent 
advances in cognitive theory and attempts to applythis to rehabilitation, followed by empirical papers 
reporting on rehabilitation-related research. There are, additionally, overview chapters covering the general 
implications of cognitive neuropsychological research for cognitive rehabilitation, and introductions to the 
chapters within each topic area.<BR>
<BR>
The papers present both a state-of-the-art review and an attempt to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses 
of the cognitive neuropsychological approach to cognitive rehabilitation. Papers evaluate the utility of 
cognitive neuropsychological analyses for both diagnosis and the design of therapy, and they also assess 
the use of rehabilitation research for testing theories of normal performance. The book is essential reading 
for all those interested in the application of cognitive neuropsychology to cognitive rehabilitation.<BR>

<B>Second edition</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
We are delighted to publish this second edition of Anorexia Nervosa: Guidelines for Assessment and 
Treatment in Primary and Secondary Care, based on the first author's long-standing "St George's" 
Approach, which has been so well received since it was first published in 1994. The book aims to outline in   
a clear, practical way, the minimal intervention necessary within primary and secondary care settings if the 
psychopathology of this serious and life-threatening illness is first to be identified and then treated with 
some hope of success. This first attempt at a time-limited and basic meaningful intervention involves 
concurrent use by both patient and therapist (and also, to some extent, the family) of the 'self-help' book 
Anorexia Nervosa: The Wish to Change and the Patient's Log Book, and all three books can be purchased 
as a package.<BR>
<BR>
Arthur Crisp, MD, DSc, FRCP, FRCP(E), FRCPsych, is emeritus professor of psychological medicine in 
the University of London at St George's Hospital Medical School. He has treated patients suffering from 
anorexia nervosa for over 35 years and has researched the condition extensively. Lisa McClelland, BSc, 
MB, BS, MRCPsych, was lecturer in psychiatry at St George's Hospital Medical School and worked with 
Professor Crisp in the Anorectic Unit. She is now a consultant psychiatrist in Devon.<BR>

<BR>
This new edition of Anorexia Nervosa: Guidelines for Assessment and Treatment in Primary and 
Secondary Care,updates the earlier edition which was so well received when first published in 1994. As 
before, it is based on Professor Crisp's longstanding views which came to be known as the ~St. George's" 
approach to anorexia nervosa. The book aims to outline in a clear, practical way, the minimal intervention 
necessary within primary and secondary care settings if the psychopathology of this serious and life-
threatening illness is first to be identified and then treated with some hope of success. <BR>
<BR>
The approach outlined in the book is the first attempt at a time-limited and meaningful intervention in the 
assessment and care of anorexia nervosa. The approach involves concurrent use by both patient and 
therapist (and also, to some extent, the family) of the 'self-help' book Anorexia Nervosa: The Wish to 
Change and the Patient's Log Book. Together, the three books form the clinician's pack. Further copies of 
Anorexia Nervosa: The Wish to Change and the Patient's Log Book may be purchased separately and 
discounts are available for bulk purchases of 10 or more copies (see order form for further information).

<CENTER><H3>THE USE OF SINGLE CASE RESEARCH DESIGNS IN REHABILITATION STUDIES</H3>

<B>JANE RIDDOCH (University of Birmingham), SHEILA LENNON (Guys Hospital), Eds.</B><BR>
<BR>
The papers collated here in this Special Issue have been produced by practising clinicians rather than 
established research workers. The approach adopted indicates that it is possible to evaluate everyday 
practice in an objective manner in a variety of clinical situations. The authors have presented examples 
from a number of different clinical areas: Outpatients (Beattie, Kettle), Community Care (Farrell), 
Neurological Rehabilitation (Cornell, Lennon, Richardson), and the Intensive Care Unit (Henderson &amp  
Davies). They suggest that there is a need to establish a more objective database in physiotherapy if any 
strong claims are to be made about the different therapeutic techniques that are standardly employed. The 
authors argue that group studies are difficult to implement and that the results may be difficult to evaluate. 
They suggest that the small N approach is a useful method of establishing generality of findings in addition 
to answering some of the criticisms of simple AB designs applied to a single case. One of the studies 
included in this issue illustrates the use of small N designs (Cornell). A possible way forward in clinical 
practice is for every therapist to attempt to evaluate practice along the lines outlined in the Editorial, and 
which have been attempted by contributors to this issue.<BR>

PSYCHOLOGY</H3></CENTER>
MICHAEL W. EYSENCK (Royal Holloway University of London)<BR>
<BR>
This is a title in the modular Principles of Psychology Series which is designed for introductory courses. 
Cognitive psychology is a large and expanding area within psychology as a whole. However, there are 
certain topics, such as perception, memory, language and reasoning, which are generally regarded as being 
of fundamental importance. It is this central core of cognitive psychology which is the focus of this book. 
If you have ever wondered how we perceive the world, or use language, or remember information, then 
this book provides intriguing insights into how we perform these, and other, complicated activities.<BR>
<BR>
This book provides an up-to-date approach to cognitive psychology, but with a particular emphasis on 
accessibility and clarity of style. As a consequence, the book can be read easily by anyone interested in 
cognitive psychology even if they do not possess any previous knowledge of the subject. <BR>

Some comments from manuscript reviewers:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"A very thorough updating. Will make the textbook even more useful than before. I think the 
book is the best on the market, by far, for 2nd and 3rd year undergraduates taking Perception courses 
in Psychology, Zoology and Visual Science/Optometry. Also undoubtedly provides good groundwork 
for post-graduates and researchers in the fields of Perception, Animal Behaviour and Computer 
Vision." Mark Georgeson (Bristol University)
<LI>"As the years have passed by I have come to appreciate the first edition more and more.... The 
proposed second edition looks even better. It covers many of the exciting areas of current perceptual 
research which are simply not covered at all by American undergraduate texts." Peter Thompson 
(University of York)
<LI>"a fresh, easy and stimulating book." Roger Watt (University of Stirling)
</UL>
<BR>
Recent theoretical developments and research findings from three different approaches to visual perception 
are brought together in this book. The first approach is physiological; the evolution of different types of 
eye and the physiology of mammalian visual pathways are described. The second is the traditional 
psychological approach; perceptual organisation, the perception of depth and motion, and pattern 
recognition are discussed in terms of the processing of information contained in retinal images. Emphasis is 
placed on recent computational work on these processes, and particularly on algorithms for the detection of 
edges and motion, the computation of stereo disparity, and object recognition. Connectionist approaches to 
these problems are discussed and contrasted with those of theorists such as Marr.  The third perspective 
considered is ecological; the work of Gibson and his followers is described and applied to problems of 
animal and human locomotion, event perception and perception of the social world, including the human 
face. The book stands out from other texts on visual perception in treating both the computational and 
ecological approaches in detail, and in seeking to clarify the points of contact and controversy between 
them. It is also distinctive in placing emphasis on animal vision as well as that of humans. Aimed at 
advanced undergraduate psychology and zoology students, this book will also prove of value to 
postgraduate students and research workers.<BR>
<BR>
The book has been updated and substantially enlarged in its second edition, in particular to include new 
material on connectionism, the computation of motion and the primal sketch.<BR>

<B>Edited by CHRIS CODE (University of Sydney) CLAUS-W. WALLESCH (University of 
Magdeburg) YVES JOANETTE (University of Montreal) ANDRE ROCH LECOURS (University of 
Montreal)</B><BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>~This is a broad and fascinating collection of chapters which reveal (sometimes for the first time 
in English) early neuropsychological attempts to make sense of what still remain some of the most 
striking behavioural consequences of brain damage. The editors are to be congratulated for bringing 
together some of the leading specialists when covering the wide range of topics chosen. The book I 
suspect will have considerable appeal to a wide range of professional researchers, graduate students 
of neuroscience, teachers, therapists and clinicians.~ - <B>Peter W. Halligan (University of 
Oxford)</B>
</UL>
<BR>
Within the last decade or so the importance of detailed examination and theoretical interpretation of the 
single case has been increasingly recognised in neuropsychology. This book brings together in one volume 
discussion of the classic cases which have shaped the way we think about the relationships between brain, 
behaviour and cognition. The editors were concerned with the important single case. It may be ancient 
(Broca's case LeBorgne) or modern (Marshall &amp  Newcombe's deep dyslexic G.R.), famous (Phineas 
Gage) or less well-known (Burckhardt's early psychosurgery cases). But the book is comprehensive in its 
coverage of contemporary neuropsychological issues. Represented are classic cases in language, memory, 
perception, attention and praxis. Some of the cases included are rare, or have acted as catalysts to the 
development of theory. Some have remained the definitive case; many were the first of their type to be 
described and gave rise to the development of new syndrome entities. Some are still controversial. In some 
instances, the cases resulted in major paradigm shifts. Some, while still highly influential, were 
misinterpreted. But most of them were read only by a few in their original form. All the cases included are 
classics in the sense that they have made a special contribution or are particularly representative. Each 
chapter highlights the relevance of the case for the development of neuropsychology, describes the  
particular features of the case that are interesting and rare and discusses the theoretical implications.<BR>

COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
SARA MEADOWS (University of Bristol)<BR>
<BR>
The association between parent's behaviour and children's cognitive development is at the meeting place of 
several prominent theories of psychological development and a range of complex methodological and 
conceptual issues. On the one hand there are theories which argue that the impetus of development is 
within the child and is largely unaffected by his or her experience of social interaction: on the other are the 
commonsense experience of parents and educators, and the body of neo-Vygotskian theory, which would 
see the child's development as profoundly affected by social interaction or even constituted by it. The 
purpose of this book is to examine theories and evidence carefully in order to assess the causal links 
between parent behaviour and children's cognitive development.<BR>
<BR>
There is a considerable amount of evidence that suggests an association between parents' behaviour and 
their children's cognitive development; but there are many possible explanations for this association, 
including direct effects of parental teaching styles on the children's learning and motivation, differential 
social class practices and opportunities, genetic resemblances, and methodological artifacts. A close and 
critical look at a wide range of research and of theory is necessary if the causal questions are to be clarified. 
<BR>
<BR>
This book develops the current arguments about the nature and causes of cognitive development, providing 
a critical discussion of the available research and relating it to psychological theory. It is suitable for 
advanced students of psychology and education.<BR>

<I>The International Journal of Psychology</I> is the journal of the <I>International Union of 
Psychological Science</I> (I.U.Psy.S.) and is edited by the IUPsyS. Its purpose is to circulate scientific 
information within and among subdisciplines of psychology and to foster the development of 
psychological science around the world.  The main part of each issue is devoted to empirical and 
theoretical papers in various fields of scientific psychology. Fields covered include general psychology 
(perception, learning, cognitive processes, language etc.), neuropsychology, developmental psychology, as 
well as social, biological, and cross-cultural psychology. The journal emphasises basic research and theory 
rather than technical and applied problems. With the aim of overcoming local limitations in psychology, 
the Journal is also devoted to international discussions of theories and methods on which psychologists 
from various countries and regions may differ.   Many of IJP's issues include a second section, the 
International Platform for Psychologists, which provides an opportunity to exchange news and opinions on 
psychology as an academic and applied profession. This section also contains information about the 
IUPsyS, about major international meetings, and about the activities of the National Psychological 
Societies. Finally it offers an opportunity to express opinions and to discuss internationally significant 
psychological issues.  The Journal occasionally publishes a special issue, guest edited by specialists, 
devoted to a single topic.<BR>

Psychological Dimensions of Global Change is a special issue of the International Journal of Psychology 
which attempts to bridge some gaps between the natural and social/behavioural sciences. The articles deal 
with the world-wide changes in the earth's climate, called the greenhouse effect or global warming. These 
are at the centre of the multi-disciplinary research programs, which explore the causes and likely effects of 
these fundamental processes. To a large extent, these changes, as currently described and modelled by 
earth and meteorological sciences, are a direct or indirect result of human action (or human failure to act 
properly).  Furthermore, these global environmental changes are likely to trigger major changes in the 
living conditions of many living species, including humankind. Human attitudes and motives, human 
perception and awareness, and human behaviour are potent driving forces and important criteria in the 
multi-feedbacked system of global environmental change. In this sense the psychology of global change 
constitutes an important research agenda, both in the actors' and victims' sense of these changes.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>ERRORS, ERROR DETECTION, AND ERROR 
RECOVERY</H3>
<B>A Special Issue of the journal Applied Psychology: An International Review</B></CENTER><BR>

JAMES T. REASON (University of Manchester) DIETER ZAPF (University of Konstanz, Germany) 
Eds.<BR>
<BR>
Human errors have become an important research topic in many areas of applied psychology and there is 
also growing public interest in human errors because of events such as the Challenger explosion, 
Chernobyl disaster, and some recent aircraft accidents. In this special issue, researchers working in 
different areas using different theories and methods, present the most recent developments in error 
research. It starts with a framework of human errors based on action regulation and problem solving theory 
and discusses the limited capacity of conscious thinking, the tendency to protect one's feeling of  
competency, the weight of the actual problem and forgetting, as the main causes of human errors. 
Processes of error detection have been largely ignored in the literature. In this special issue, two articles 
present a taxonomy of error detection modes. Error detection mechanisms occurring in the context of 
human-computer interaction are discussed and the limitations of supporting error detection by technical 
systems are demonstrated. Several articles discuss errors and error handling in the context of human-
computer interaction, a rather new field of error research. The authors address both problems of error 
prevention strategies like visualisation of information and problems of error management strategies like the 
undo function. In a final contribution, the authors discuss Gestalt principles to explain a series of errors in 
perception, thinking, and acting.<BR>
<BR>
Applied psychologists as well as safety engineers, software developers, management and software trainers 
will profit from this special issue of Applied Psychology: An International Review.<BR>

<BR>
Cognitive neuropsychology is a field of study in which disorders of cognition are evaluated and interpreted 
from the perspective of models of normal cognitive function. The goal is to offer theoretically-motivated 
explanations of what has gone wrong, and what remains intact, in the multicomponent mental system. 
Rehabilitation efforts motivated from this perspective attempt to characterize patients' deficits with 
reference to a normal model; therapy is designed on the basis of hypotheses about the nature of the 
underlying disorder. A considerable number of cognitive neuropsychological treatment studies have been 
published in recent years, and these have generated interest from researchers and clinicians alike. <BR>
Researchers have found that data from treatment studies can contribute important information to the 
cognitive model that is used to guide the treatment by allowing investigation of symptom 
associations/dissociations as performance changes over time. Clinicians have found this approach useful 
for predicting patterns of generalization to untreated functions, and for identifying patients who are likely 
to respond to specific interventions. This volume reports six original treatment studies carried out from this 
perspective, targeting symptoms of word retrieval, sentence comprehension, reading aloud, and written 
spelling. An introduction to this approach, with a summary of contributions, is also provided.<BR>

<H4>REVIEW IN THES</H4>
"This journal will certainly fulfil the need of informing the practising W &amp  O psychologist, and 
perhaps begin to translate the more academically oriented articles published elsewhere, which have 
enormous relevance but which need to be put in the context of organisational life." <BR>
Professor Cary Cooper in the Times Higher Education Supplement<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>* How do busy professionals find time to keep up-to-date in their area of expertise?
<LI>* How do academics discover what are the real problems facing employees and organisations?
<LI>Answer - they all read the European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology.
</UL>
<BR>
It is the express aim of EJWOP to bring professionals and academics into closer collaboration. To this end 
we have chosen a series of topics for each issue which are of immediate relevance to the world of work: 
`Innovation in Organizations' and `Mobbing and Victimization at Work' are but two examples.  What's 
more, we have ensured a dual perspective by inviting an academic and a practitioner wherever possible as 
Guest Editors for each issue; and the traditional academic format of a sequence of articles has been 
replaced by a mixture of articles, case studies,  reviews of instruments etc.<BR>
<BR>
The new EJWOP will be a journal of the highest quality - Guest Editors are invited because of their 
expertise in the topic area in question, and they will send out material for external peer review where 
appropriate.   What's most important, though, is that EJWOP is read widely by practitioners and academics 
and that both find it useful. The issues that we have to address in the world of work as we approach the 
millennium require no less.<BR>

<LI>"Cognition in Action presents a wide range of topics in cognitive psychology in a way that is 
directly accessible to the undergraduate reader. It summarises important, up-to-date ideas and findings 
as well as covering some of the classic work and long-standing issues in the area. This second edition 
includes a number of new topics and perspectives not covered in the first edition. The revisions are 
far from cosmetic: substantial new sections have been added to the majority of the chapters. In 
particular, the book includes descriptions of connectionist models in many of the areas covered." 
<B>(Dianne Berry, University of Reading)</B>.

<BR>
This is a substantial revision of an innovative textbook designed for undergraduate courses in cognitive 
psychology. It approaches cognitive psychology by asking what it says about how people carry out 
everyday activities: how people organise and use their knowledge in order to behave appropriately in the 
world in which they live. Each chapter of the book starts with an example, and then uses this to introduce 
some aspect of the overall cognitive system. Through such examples of cognition in action, important 
components of the cognitive system are identified and their interrelationships highlighted. Thus this text 
demonstrates that each part of the cognitive system can only be understood properly in its place in the 
functioning of the whole. A particular feature of this new edition is increased coverage of 
neuropsychological and connectionist approaches to cognition.<BR>

<B>DR GILLIAN COHEN (The Open University)</B><BR>
<BR>
In the last decade there has been a new wave of research on memory in everyday life, as psychologists 
have sought to give the study of memory greater ecological validity. This book provides a comprehensive 
state-of-the-art review, bringing together studies on many different topics such as memory for plans and 
actions; for names and faces; for routes and maps; conversations and stories; autobiographical experiences 
and childhood events. The limitations and advantages of the naturalistic approach are discussed and 
critically evaluated. The relationship between everyday memory research and the traditional laboratory-
bound method is seen as complementary rather than antagonistic. The book shows how models and 
conceptual frameworks such as schemas, scripts, mental models and production systems are needed to 
explain and interpret the findings and observations derived from the study of memory in the real world.<BR>
<H4>Contents:</H4>

VICKI BRUCE (University of Stirling) Ed.<BR>
<BR>
This book is for use in tutorials and seminars with psychology, neuroscience and cognitive science 
undergraduates studying cognition. The book complements standard course texts in cognition by providing 
a series of articles which emphasise particularly what we don't understand, rather than what we think we 
do. We consider a selection of problems and phenomena that remain mysterious despite years, decades or 
in some cases centuries of enquiry, and evaluate different approaches to these problems. <BR>
<BR>
Here expert authors present scholarly reviews which between them sample many different varieties of 
mystery, ranging from specific optical illusions through to the nature of consciousness. Some of these 
"unsolved" problems provide an ideal vehicle for reviewing different paradigms, and shifts in our 
discipline over this past century, introducing a historical perspective often missing from standard texts. 
Each chapter also poses some of the unasked questions that remain, and offers possible new directions for 
future enquiry. The emphasis on unsolved mysteries is intended to stimulate discussion and debate, and to 
encourage our next generation of researchers to realise that there is plenty of scope for new ideas and 
approaches.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>ADOLESCENCE AND ITS SOCIAL 
WORLDS</H3></CENTER>
SANDY JACKSON (University of Groningen, The Netherlands), HECTOR RODRIGUEZ-TOM  
(C.N.R.S., Paris, France) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
For most young people, development through adolescence involves exposure to a variety of new social 
worlds. Parents provide increasing room for personal autonomy and take account of emerging skills and 
responsibilities. Peers become more important as confidants and as sources of support. Relationships with 
the opposite sex become more significant and move towards greater intimacy and commitment. Progress 
through school leads to clearer ideas about personal aspirations and career choice. Areas such as culture, 
social priorities and politics begin to attract more interest and involvement. The direction, nature and extent 
of the adolescent's engagement in each of these social worlds is influenced by factors such as personal 
history and characteristics, physical maturation and intellectual capacity.<BR>
<BR>
This book provides a detailed examination of a variety of these different social worlds. The processes 
involved in social interactions are considered with specific reference to adolescent development. A 
framework for analysing research dealing with relational contexts such as the family is presented and its 
application is illustrated and discussed. Further chapters focus upon more specific topics: physical 
maturation and social development; dating behaviour; relationships with parents and peers; stress and 
coping in adolescence; loneliness and its characteristics; relationships with the institutional order. The final 
chapter returns to theory and urges the need to develop a more realistic conceptual structure which is 
relevant to the real-life experiences of young people growing up in today's world. <BR>
<BR>
The book discusses new theoretical ideas and recent findings in both traditional and emerging areas of 
research on social development. In doing so, it provides an unusually detailed picture of the changing 
nature of social relationships and social contexts during the adolescent years. <BR>

<UL>
<LI>"As a source of information on the pattern of memory disorder seen in various cerebral diseases, 
it is unparalleled, and most neuropsychologists and neurologists could well benefit by having a copy." 
Niall Cartlidge (Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne) in the British Medical Journal.
<LI>"Will be of particular use to those who regularly deal with memory-impaired patients and wish 
to have a state-of-the-art knowledge about the neurological conditions underlying impaired memory, 
how to assess such impairment, the best methods of management of each condition, and some 
information about what memory processes have been disrupted." Andrew Mayes  (Department of 
Neurology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield) in Brain.
</UL>
<BR>
The diagnosis and treatment of memory disorders pose considerable problems for the clinician. Many 
different organic conditions produce disturbances of memory, but the relationship between cerebral 
pathology and memory disturbance can often be difficult to establish. Furthermore, assessment and 
treatment require specialized skills and merit an inter-disciplinary approach towards patient management.  
Despite the many books which have been written on various aspects of memory disorders, none so far has 
been specially designed to give practical help to those who have to deal with diagnosis and subsequent 
management of patients with memory disturbance resulting from specific types of cerebral pathology.<BR>
<BR>
The author achieves this aim by organizing his book on the basis of clinical aetiology. Anatomical and 
psychological perspectives are also introduced, but the emphasis is on approaches which will help 
clinicians in the management of patients with specific neurological diseases. For example, the essential 
topic of differential diagnosis is given prominence throughout: the principles of diagnostic assessment are 
discussed in a separate chapter, and specific diagnostic features are also outlined in each of the chapters 
dealing with individual cerebral pathologies. For the discussion of assessment, the author draws on his own 
extensive experience as a practising clinical neuropsychologist to describe and evaluate the range of 
existing memory test procedures, and to suggest additional procedures as appropriate. Where 
evidenceexists on the treatment of memory disorders in specific neurological conditions, this is also 
discussed and critically reviewed. Full references are also given for those wishing to develop their own 
assessment of therapeutic procedures. The text is extensively illustrated, with much previously unpublished 
material on individual neurological conditions giving some remarkable insights into the links between 
cerebral pathology and memory dysfunction.<BR>
<BR>
Mainly intended for practising neurologists and clinical neuropsychologists, anyone whose work brings 
them into contact with patients suffering from memory disturbance will find this book invaluable.<BR>

Latin America is a continent better known for its social, economic and political problems (population 
growth, illiteracy, lack of nutrition, drug production and sales, external debt and coups d' tat ), than for its 
cultural production. Nevertheless, Latin America has made original and important contributions to the 
development of music, painting, literature and the sciences. In the field of psychology, in particular, 
psychologists throughout the continent are contributing highly relevant research findings to social, 
political, environmental, educational and health psychology. In this Special Issue, one can observe the 
influence of variables that are very typical of the Latin America context, mainly problems related to value 
formation, attitudes, the development of social perception, socialisation, political behaviour, conservation 
of the physical environment, the diffusion and implementation of educational innovations, training 
programmes at different levels within the education system, the promotion of health programmes and the  
prevention of illness.<BR>

<LI>"Berry and Dienes provide a very thorough review of the theoretical and practical issues behind 
implicit learning, and I would strongly recommend their book to anyone who wants to discover what 
all the excitement is about...thoroughly recommended." <B>David Shanks, Quarterly Journal of 
Experimental Psychology
</B></UL>
<BR>
There is considerable debate over the extent to which cognitive tasks can be learned non-consciously or 
implicitly. In recent years a large number of studies have demonstrated a discrepancy between explicit 
knowledge and measured performance. This book presents an overview of these studies and attempts to 
clarify apparently disparate results by placing them in a coherent theoretical framework.  It draws on 
evidence from neuropsychological and computational modelling studies as well as the many laboratory 
experiments.Chapter one sets out the background to the large number of recent studies on implicit learning. 
It discusses research on implicit memory, perception without awareness, and automaticity. It attempts to set 
the implicit - explicit distinction in the context of other relevant dichotomies in the literature. Chapter two 
presents an overview of research on the control of complex systems, from Broadbent (1977) through to the 
present day. It looks at the accessibility of control task knowledge, as well as whether there is any other 
evidence for a distinction between implicit and explicit modes of learning. Chapter three critically reviews 
studies claiming to show that people can acquire concepts without being verbally aware of the basis on 
which they are responding. It shows that concept formation can be implicit in some sense but not in others. 
Chapter four investigates the claim that people can learn sequential information in an implicit way. Chapter 
five looks at whether computational modelling can elucidate the nature of implicit learning. It examines the 
feasibility of different exemplar connectionist models in accounting for performance in concept learning, 
sequence learning, and control task experiments. Chapter six reviews evidence concerning dissociations 
between implicit and explicit knowledge in various neuropsychological syndromes. Finally, chapters seven 
and eight discuss the many practical and theoretical implications of the research.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>PERSPECTIVES ON THINKING AND 
REASONING</H3>
<B>Essays in Honour of Peter Wason</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
STEPHEN NEWSTEAD and JONATHAN St.B. T. EVANS (University of Plymouth) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
In recent years, there has been a massive upsurge in interest in the psychology of thinking and reasoning. 
This book contains contributions from virtually all the main players involved in research into these areas. It 
focuses on three reasoning problems devised by Peter Wason - the selection task, the 2-4-6 task and the 
THOG problem - which have inspired countless journal articles over the past 25 years. Despite this intense 
interest, the reasons why people make so many errors in these seemingly simple tasks are still not fully 
understood. A variety of different theoretical perspectives have been used in trying to explain performance. 
These include the mental models approach, the pragmatic reasoning approach and the mental logic 
approach. All of the leading proponents of these theories have contributed chapters to this book in which 
they expand and update their theories. Other chapters, some reviewing the literature, others offering new 
theoretical perspectives, have been produced by leading researchers from both sides of the Atlantic. There 
is a final chapter from Peter Wason himself, whose early research prompted the initial interest in these 
areas. He describes how he came to create the tasks which have proved so influential. The entire book is in 
essence a tribute to his enormous contribution to research in the psychology of reasoning.<BR>

PSYCHOLOGY</H3></CENTER>
GEORGE BUTTERWORTH (University of Sussex), MARGARET HARRIS  (Royal Holloway University 
of London)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"The book is a well-written and stimulating introduction to the field of developmental 
psychology, and is now the recommended text for my introductory course in cognitive development." 
<B>Elizabeth Meins (Staffordshire University) in The British Psychological Society 
Developmental Psychology Section Newsletter.</B>
<LI>"Butterworth and Harris have produced a very clear and accessible introductory textbook to 
developmental psychology .. The balance of the book is good with a timely attempt to include fetal 
development and old age as well as the more usual topics of infancy and childhood. The written style 
is engaging and readable ... I would like to emphasise that overall I think the book is very good 
indeed." <B>Usha Goswami, University of Cambridge </B>
<LI>"I think the book will sell well to the 'A level/1st year undergraduate market. The book is 
academically well informed and clearly organised. It moves well beyond the coverage given in the 
general texts, and the pitch is ideal - the language is clear and accessible and the material covered is 
well suited to many aspects of the AEB `A' level syllabus." <B>Paul Humphreys, Chief Examiner 
of the AEB Psychology `A' Level</B>
</UL>
<BR>
Developmental psychology is concerned with the scientific understanding of age related changes in 
experience and behaviour, not only in children but throughout the lifespan. The task is to discover, 
describe, and explain how development occurs, from its earliest origins, into childhood, adulthood, and old 
age. To understand human development requires one not only to make contact with human nature but also 
to consider the diverse effects of culture on the developing child. Development is as much a process of 
acquiring culture as it is of biological growth. <BR>
<BR>
This book reviews the history of developmental psychology with respect to both its nature and the effects 
of transmission of culture. The major theorists of the late 19th and early 20th century (Piaget, Vygotsky, 
Bowlby) are introduced to provide a background to contemporary research and the modern synthesis of 
nature and nurture.  This brief textbook is suitable as a first introduction to developmental psychology. It 
will be of interest to psychologists, educationalists, social workers and others with an interest in a 
contemporary understanding of factors involved in human development. <BR>

BERNHARD WILPERT (Technische Universit t Berlin), THORALF QVALE Eds.<BR>
<BR>
This volume contains a selection of original contributions from internationally reputed scholars in the field 
of risk management in socio-technical systems with high hazard potential. Its first major section addresses 
fundamental psychological and socio-technical concepts in the field of risk perception, risk management 
and learning systems for safety improvement.<BR>
<BR>
The second section deals with the variety of procedures for system safety analysis. It covers strategies of 
analyzing automation problems and of safety culture as well as the analysis of social dynamics in field 
settings and of field experiments. Its third part then illustrates the utilization of basic concepts and analytic 
approaches by way of case studies of designing man-machine systems and in various industrial sectors 
such as intensive care wards, aviation, offfshore oil drilling and chemical industry. In linking basic 
theoretical conceptual notions and analytic strategies to detailed case studies in the area of hazardous work 
organizations the volume differs from and complements more theoretical works such as Human Error (J. 
Reason, 1990) and more general approaches such as New Technologies and Human Error (J. Rasmussen, 
K. Duncan, J. Leplat, Eds.)<BR>

Psychological science is worldwide, but it originated earlier in some countries and regions than in others, 
and the course of development has differed among countries and regions. Psychology has also interacted 
with quite different cultural backgrounds in different regions of the world.  The special issue of the 
International Journal of Psychology contains seven papers that treat the origins and development of 
psychology in most of the regions of the world. It includes countries and regions where psychology has a 
long history and has attained major status and also developing countries where psychology is more recent 
and is less well established. It includes papers on countries of European culture and also countries where 
psychology interacts with the background of Asian and Latin American cultures. The authors of the papers, 
all well known internationally, are all present or past members of the Executive Committee of the 
International Union of Psychological Science and so are well acquainted with world psychology and 
psychology in countries besides their own. All of the authors have done research in other countries than 
their own and so can place the development of psychology in their own regions within the context of world 
psychology. These contributions show both the common features of psychological science around the 
world and also the special problems and special opportunities of psychology in different regional and 
cultural settings.<BR>

<BR>
<CENTER><H3>AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN-COMPUTER 
INTERACTION</H3>
<H3>Paul Booth (Manchester Polytechnic)</H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"This book is the best introduction to the science of human-computer interaction that I have 
seen. Booth provides a very effective overview of the extant research in HCI, as well as commentary 
on the roles of various perspectives and scientific disciplines...This is an academic text, in the best 
sense of the word. Each chapter is easily readable in one sitting, yet each has a selective annotated 
bibliography to lead on to primary research sources..." Tom Carey, SIGCHI Bulletin 
<LI>"It will fit into any introductory course in HCI...Paul has done a superb job" Professor Neils 
Bjorn-Andersen, (Copenhagen School of Economics and Business Administration).
<LI>"...readers may find Booth's book to be of somewhat greater interest than many of the more 
trivial, and apparently fairly hastily written texts that are presently on the market or are likely to 
surface in the near future... The scope of the book's coverage is impressive, yet no real sacrifice is 
made in terms of the inclusion of detailed discussion of more difficult topics... The book is 
exceedingly well organized... I would have no hesitation in recommending this book to any 
undergraduate taking a course in Human-Computer Interaction." Simon Davis (International Journal 
of Man-Machine Studies)
<LI>"Paul Booth and his collaborators have produced a useful overview of the current state of 
understanding of questions of design in human-computer interaction... The strength of the book is that 
it outlines many of the key questions which will affect the relationship between a system and its 
users... this book will be a very useful resource for the system designer who wishes to avoid making a 
misery of the lives of the people who use his products." Bernard Sufrin (Times Higher Education 
Supplement)
</UL>
<BR>
This text provides a comprehensive and authoritative introduction to the burgeoning discipline of Human-
Computer Interaction for students, academics, and those from industry who wish to know more about the 
subject. Assuming very little knowledge,the book provides an overview of the diverse research areas that 
are only gradually building into a coherent and well -structured field. It aims to explain the underlying 
causes of the cognitive, social and organizational problems typically encountered when computer systems 
are introduced. It is clear and concise, whilst avoiding the oversimplification of important issues and 
ideas.<BR>
<H4>Contents:</H4>
A definition of Human-Computer Interaction, and an examination of the disciplines that contribute towards 
it. Technologies that enable interaction. Human-Computer dialogue. Cognitive models in HCI. Usability, 
its definition and measurement. The design process, and approaches to design. The organizational impact 
of computer systems. A perspective on the future of Human-Computer Interaction.<BR>

B. DE GELDER (Tilburg University and Universite Libre de Bruxelles) J. MORAIS (Universite Libre de

<BR>
This collection of papers introduces a new dimension in the understanding of reading by focussing on the 
relation between spoken and written language processing. It introduces new perspectives on speech and 
reading by highlighting aspects of the two that have received little attention in the past. The comparative 
approach to speech and reading concerns new approaches to the development of speech and reading, the 
existence of nonconventional input modalities like braille reading and lipreading, the study of populations 
with specific disorders in the abilities implicated in normal speaking and reading. Papers discuss the 
reading process in non-alphabetic orthographies, the specifics of the reading acquisition problem in 
logographic or mixed writing systems (like Chinese and Japanese) and its relation to underlying speech 
representations. The role of phonological processes in different modalities and writing systems and at 
different stages in the reading acquisition process is a central concern of all chapters. Drawing on expertise 
of the contributors the book presents a novel and multifaceted view of the achievements, the promises and 
the challenges facing the researcher once the intimate link between speech and reading comes to the 
foreground.<BR>

Understanding how young children begin to make sense out of the social world has become a major 
concern within developmental psychology. Over the last 25 years research in this area has raised a number 
of questions which mirror the confluence of interests from cognitive-developmental and social-
developmental psychology. The aims of this book are to consider critically the major themes and findings 
within this growing social-cognitive developmental research, and to present a new theoretical framework 
for investigating children's social cognitive skills. Beyond being the first major review of the literature in 
this area, this synopsis articulates why contemporary theoretical ideas (e.g. information processing, 
Piagetian and social interactionist) are unlikely ever to provide the conceptual basis for understanding 
children's participative skills. <BR>
<BR>
Building upon ideas both within and beyond mainstream developmental psychology, the "eco-structural" 
approach advocated seeks to draw together the advantages of the ecological approach in perceptual 
psychology with the considerable insights of the conversational analysts, child language researchers and 
Goffman's analysis of social interaction. This convergence is centred around the dynamic and participatory 
realities of engaging in conversational contexts, the locus for acquiring social cognitive skills. The 
framework provides the building  blocks for models of developmental social cognition which can  
accommodate dynamic aspects of children's conversational skills. This book then is a review of an 
important area of developmental psychology, a new perspective on how we can study children's 
participatory social-cognitive skills and a summary of supporting research for the framework 
advocated.<BR>

<BR>
<I>Thinking &amp  Reasoning</I> is a new international journal dedicated to the understanding of 
human thought processes, with particular emphasis on studies on reasoning. Whilst the primary focus is on 
psychological studies of thinking, contributions are welcome from philosophers, artificial intelligence 
researchers and other cognitive scientists whose work bears upon the central concerns of the journal. 
Topics published in the journal include studies of deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, problem 
solving, decision making, probability judgement, conceptual thinking and the influence of language and 
culture on thought.<BR>
<BR>
Papers will be accepted for publication on the basis of scientific quality, clarity of exposition and 
contribution to theoretical understanding of human thinking. <BR>
Contributions may take any of the following forms: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>* Empirical studies using any methodology appropriate to questions addressed, including 
experimental or observational methods and utilising either quantitative or qualitative analyses.
<LI>* Theoretical contributions pertinent to issues in the empirical study of human thought but not 
reporting new data.
<LI>* Critical reviews of research literatures which synthesise findings reported by different authors 
and which derive new insights or permit conclusions which enhance understanding of theoretical 
issues.
<LI>* Critical discussion of papers published in <I>Thinking &amp  Reasoning </I>and short 
reports or notes on other relevant issues.
</UL>
It will rarely be possible to accept a manuscript in excess of 12,000 words in length, including tables and 
figures. Notes and discussions will normally be less than 3,000 words in length. <BR>

<LI>"A comprehensive overview of acquired neurological conditions in childhood is presented here, 
and the book describes the neuropsychological and linguistic deficits linked to these. The book is 
warmly recommended to a wide readership, both students and practising clinicians." Margaret 
Edwards (Formerly Lecturer in Human Communications, Institute of Neurology) in Therapy Weekly. 
<LI>"The book as a whole contains a wealth of information and is an excellent overview of the 
literature in this area. The information is reinforced by the frequent use of detailed case studies. In the 
preface the series editors state that they hope to present texts that are both acessible and scholarly and 
that are useful to a variety of professions working with the brain damaged. This book goes a long way 
in meeting these criteria and should be a useful reference source for those interested in this field." 
Rhonwen Shaw (National Hospital's College of Speech Sciences) in British Journal of Psychology.

<BR>
This book provides a uniquely comprehensive coverage of the neuropathological basis, symptomatology, 
assessment and treatment of acquired language and motor speech disorders resulting from a variety of 
conditions that cause damage to the nervous system in childhood. The book discusses not only the more 
commonly recognized acquired childhood speech and language disorders, such as those associated with 
closed head injury, tumours and cerebrovascular accidents, but also includes less well-recognized 
communicative impairments associated with neurological disorders caused by cerebral anoxia, inborn 
errors of metabolism, neural tube defects, infections, radiation induced brain damage and convulsive 
disorders.<BR>

<TITLE>APPROACHES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORAL 
REASONING</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>APPROACHES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
MORAL REASONING</H3></CENTER>
PETER E. LANGFORD (La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia)<BR>
<BR>
The first part of the book offers a survey of current approaches to the development of moral reasoning: 
those of Freud, ego psychology, Piaget and Kohlberg. The approach of Kohlberg has been popular because 
he was able to give an impressive account of findings from the key method of interviews, the other crucial 
method being naturalistic observation of moral discourse. The accounts of interview evidence given by ego 
psychology and Piaget were less comprehensive and less impressive. Naturalistic studies have either been 
impressionistic or less detailed in their methods of analysis. <BR>
<BR>
The second part of the book argues that the impressive nature of Kohlberg's later evidence for his view that 
moral reasoning passes through a sequence of stages is in part illusory, because his theory predicts that 
specific types of reply will show specific developmental patterns. However, as data are always reported in 
terms of stages, which amalgamate very disparate types of reply, it is impossible to know whether the 
specific types of reply follow their predicted developmental courses or not. Reasons given for assigning 
given types of reply to a stage are also often doubtful. This leads to discussion of studies that have reported 
findings in terms of specific types of reply (weakly interpretive methods), as opposed to Kohlberg's stage-
based and strongly interpretive methods. Findings from these disconfirm Kohlberg's theory at several 
crucial points. <BR>
<BR>
The second and third parts of the book also examine findings from non-Kohlbergian interviews and other 
methods, again advocating that weakly interpretive and largely descriptive presentation of findings is 
preferable to strongly interpretive techniques. It is argued that a wide variety of mechanisms suggested by 
the theories outlined in the first part of the book, as well as others drawn from general theories of 
personality development, are able to explain existing descriptive developmental findings. The task for the 
future is to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms.<BR>

A sufferer writes: ~This book, I can safely say, changed my entire life. I read it over and over again and I 
could not put it down. It all made so much sense. For the first time in my life, I could really relate to it and 
understand why and how I was feeling this way and most of all how I could overcome this disease.~<BR>
<BR>
This guide to 'self-help' has become highly valued by sufferers from anorexia nervosa, their families and 
their carers. It relates to Arthur Crisp's much praised text Anorexia Nervosa: Let Me Be, now in its third 
reprint. Many sufferers report that Anorexia Nervosa: The Wish to Change has provided them with their 
first private opportunity to reconsider their position and future properly, and then to do more about them. 
Carers have found it particularly helpful as a joint tool in their work with patients, especially when used 
alongside the more recently published Anorexia Nervosa:  Guidelines for Assessment and Treatment in 
Primary and Secondary Care and the Patient's Log Book from the same centre. <BR>

John Oates, Sue Sheldon (both of The Open University), Eds. <BR>
<BR>
The period of human development from birth to eighteen months holds a unique attraction for 
psychologists interested in cognitive development. It is not only that many look to these early stages for 
evidence of the origins of later abilities such as language, but also that questions about the interactions of 
environmental circumstances and genetic transmission often come to focus on infancy. This reader 
contains a selection of edited papers that present major findings of the last 20 years of infancy research and 
reflect currently active research lines. It includes readings on motor development, cultural context, 
learning, perception, concept formation, the object concept, early social behaviour and continuity.<BR>
<BR>
Prepared as a source book for a third-level Open University course, Cognitive Development, this volume 
will also be of interest to other people interested in learning more about the abilities and mental processes 
of infants, and about current research and theory in these areas. It will be particularly appropriate for use in 
undergraduate and graduate courses in psychology with a developmental context.  <BR>

SIMON GREEN (Birkbeck College, London)<BR>
<BR>
This has all the hallmarks of the best in traditional British textbooks, with sound empirical framework, and 
clarity of expression. As an introductory text, Simon Green's book provides a strong alternative to its 
glossier American cousins." Andy Parrott (University of East London) in The Psychologist.<BR>
<BR>
This book is intended to provide an introduction to the basic structure and function of the brain and 
nervous system, emphasising relationships with behaviour. The first chapter introduces the field, covering 
aims, and ethical issues. In chapter 2 the neuron is described, and electrical and chemical conduction 
presented in detail; this chapter also introduces neurotransmitter pathways and drug effects on behaviour. 
After a general survey of the behavioural organisation of the nervous system in Chapter 3, three chapters 
describe how language, learning, and memory are related to brain mechanisms, with particular emphases 
on data from human patients, and functional asymmetries between the hemispheres. The following chapter 
outlines the involvement of arousal systems in stress, anxiety, and emotion, and also covers stress reduction 
techniques. The arousal theme is maintained in Chapter 8 in which sleep is discussed in the context of 
biological rhythms in psychological and physiological processes.<BR>
<BR>
Chapter 9 covers the biological bases of motivational states such as hunger and thirst, and discusses the 
concept of homeostasis. Non-homeostatic drives such as electrical self-stimulation of the brain are also 
considered. In Chapter 10 there is a general review of sensory systems followed by detailed consideration 
of pain perception and hearing. Finally, Chapter 11 describes the physiological bases of visual sensation 
and perception. It is intended that the material in this book should satisfy the requirements for the 
biopsychology options in A-level Psychology, and for the first year undergraduate courses in the biological 
bases of behaviour.<BR>

SIOBHAN HART (Charing Cross Hospital), JAMES M. SEMPLE (Medical Research Centre, Harlow)<BR>
<BR>
Dementia is one of the most pressing problems that currently faces planners and providers of health care 
today. This has resulted in an explosion in research activity with the consequent growth of knowledge 
about all aspects of dementia and in particular about Alzheimer's disease. This book summarizes current 
knowledge of the neuropsychology of dementia, to highlight the multifaceted nature of the problem, and to  
argue that an input from neuropsychologists can facilitate the advances made by other neuroscientists 
investigating dementia. The book shows that the study of dementia has caused something of a paradigm 
shift within neuropsychology itself as a scientific discipline. <BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"The book as a whole is ideally suited for a newly qualified psychologist or psychiatrist who is 
embarking on a research career into the neuropsychology of the dementias." <B>Eileen M. Joyce in

ANASTASIA TRYPHON JACQUES VON~CHE (Jean Piaget Archives,  Geneva) Eds.<BR>
<BR>
This book is the outcome of a long and passionate debate among world experts about two of the most 
pivotal figures of psychology: Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotksy. The occasion was a week-long advanced 
course held at the Jean Piaget Archives in Geneva. The most interesting outcome of the meeting is that, in 
spite of differences in aims and scopes (epistemogenesis versus psychogenesis), in units of analysis (events 
versus action) and in social Contents (Swiss capitalism versus Soviet communism) both Piaget and 
Vygotsky reached a similar conclusion: knowledge is constructed within a specific material and social 
content. Moreover, their views complement each other perfectly: where Vygotsky insists on varieties of 
psychological experiences, Piaget shows how, out of diversity, grows universality, so much so that the 
most communist of the two is not necessarily the one who was so labelled.  <BR>
<BR>
This book is not only of interest to developmental, social and learning psychologists, but also deals with 
issues pertinent to education, epistemology, language, thought and cognition, anthropology and 
philosophy. It is likely to shed some light on the state of affairs in psychology for the general reader too, 
because it is clear and precise, straightforward and uses virtually no jargon.<BR>

BYRNE (Trinity College, Dublin) <BR>
<BR>
"We have here a much-needed comprehensive review of a major area in research on human thinking 
deductive reasoning...For cognitive scientists, this book is a "must". For those outside of cognitive science, 
it provides a very accessible account of the fascinating search for an understanding of deductive reasoning, 
an activity central to human intelligence. The book reads like an intriguing mystery that has several 
subplots that are never quite resolved, and their presence leaves the reader wanting to know more." Richard 
Grigs (University of Florida) in American Scientist.<BR>
"A highly accessible, theoretically neutral, review of the research into deductive reasoning, comprehensive 
in its scope, covering four major theoretical perspectives: formal inference-rule theories, mental model 
theories, theories base on domain-sensitive rules, and theories incorporating heuristic and bias 
formulations." S. Hensch, (University of Wisconsin Centers, Marshfield) in Social &amp  Behavioral 
Sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Deductive reasoning is widely regarded as an activity central to human intelligence, and as such has 
attracted an increasing amount of psychological study in recent years. In this first major survey of the field 
for over a decade, the authors provide a detailed and balanced review of all the main kinds of deductive 
reasoning task studied by psychologists. Topics covered include conditional and disjunctive reasoning, the 
Wason selection task, relational inference and reasoning with syllogisms and quantifiers.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the review, a careful distinction is drawn between the main empirical findings in the field and 
the major theoretical approaches proposed to account for these findings. Discussion of experimental 
findings is organized around three central questions:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>What is the extent and limitation of human competence in deductive reasoning? 
<LI>What factors are responsible for systematic errors and biases on reasoning tasks?
<LI>How is human reasoning influenced by the content in which logical problems are presented?
</UL>
<BR>
Four major classes of theory are discussed throughout the book. The long established theory that people  
have a mental logic comprised of formal rules of inference is contrasted particularly with the recently 
developed mental model theory of deductive reasoning. Explanations of many phenomena, especially 
biases, are also considered in terms of heuristic processes. Finally, consideration is given to accounts of 
content and context effects based upon the use of domain sensitive rules or schemas. The book ends with a 
discussion of research on deductive reasoning in the context of the current debate about human 
rationality.<BR>

<BR>
Recently there have been considerable advances made in understanding the kinds of processes which 
underlie our ability to recognize and name visually presented objects. These advances have come from 
experimental psychology, from studies of computer vision, and from studies of the effects of brain damage 
on object recognition and naming. This important new book draws together research from these different 
approaches to visual object processing, in an attempt to relate evidence from disorders of object processing 
to models of normal performance in both humans and animals. The book shows how studies of object 
processing can inform models of normal performance, and how such models can in turn help us understand 
object processing disorders. It illustrates the ways in which current research crosses the boundaries of 
different disciplines to gain a fuller understanding of visual recognition.<BR>

<TITLE>THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKING MEMORY</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>THE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKING 
MEMORY</H3></CENTER>
<B>A Special Issue of the International Journal of Behavioural Development</B><BR>
<B>ANIK de RIBAUPIERRE (University of Geneva), GRAHAM HITCH (University of 
Lancaster) Eds.</B><BR><B>
</B><BR>
Working memory refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of information that is being processed 
in a wide range of cognitive tasks. This Special Issue of the International Journal of Behavioral 
Development brings together research on the development of working memory that arises within two quite 
different approaches. The first is the neo-Piagetian perspective, which proposes that working memory 
limitations play an important role in the development of cognitive abilities. Accordingly, a major goal of 
neo-Piagetian research has been to develop techniques for measuring the capacity of working memory and 
to chart its development. Papers by Alp, de Ribaupierre and Bailleux, Morra, and Pascual-Leone, illustrate 
different facets of this approach.<BR>
<BR>
The second approach stems from the study of working memory and information-processing in mainstream 
cognitive psychology, which has suggested the need to distinguish relatively peripheral phonological and 
visuo-spatial subsystems from central resources. Since these subsystems are currently better understood  
than the central component of adult working memory, they have tended to be the focus of related 
developmental studies. This tendency is illustrated in papers on visuo-spatial working memory by Longoni 
and by Walker and Hitch, and on phonological working memory by Henry. A further significant strand of 
research in both approaches, is to investigate links between the development of working memory and 
various aspects of cognitive development; this type of work is illustrated in the papers by Blake on 
language acquisition and by Siegel on reading.  Although the two approaches have tended to remain rather 
separate, their complementarity is fairly obvious: One has tended to emphasise central aspects of working 
memory, the other more peripheral aspects. This special issue is intended to promote the exchange of ideas, 
methods and data between researchers using the two approaches, and to identify areas of conflicts and 
agreements. <BR>

This special issue of Visual Cognition features empirical and theoretical contributions by leading research 
scholars in the field. Following a general introduction by C. Bundesen and H. Shibuya and an authorative 
review by C.W. Eriksen of work on spatial attention in the flankers task, empirical articles by B. Hommel, 
L.T. McCalley, and C. Umilta et al. report important new findings on visual selection by spatial location. A 
second group of articles by D. Luna et al., M. Donk, J. Theeuwes, and Y.-P. Chen &amp  A. Allport report 
on recent empirical findings on visual selection by other criteria than spatial location. The last group of 
four articles consists of weighty theoretical statements by  A.H.C. van der Heijden, A. Treisman, Y. Tsal et 
al., and W.X. Schneider. As a whole, the issue forms a major contribution to the literature on visual 
selective attention. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>MULTIPLE PERSONALITY</H3>
<H3>An Exercise in Deception</H3></CENTER>
RAY ALDRIDGE-MORRIS (Middlesex Polytechnic)<BR>
<BR>
"Overall, the book is skilfully written, the topics are well researched, and Aldridge-Morris offers some 
spirited commentary concerning the present state of the empirical literature. A nontraditional view of 
multiple personality syndrome is offered that should inspire future research and continued debate. The 
volume's clarity, conciseness, and theoretical contribution make it worthwhile reading for both proponents 
and sceptics of the MPS diagnosis." Christine Zaleswski, (Contemporary Psychology 1991 Vol.36)<BR>
Multiple Personality syndrome is being diagnosed and treated in the United States in ever increasing 
numbers. Indeed, it is alleged that the incidence of this bizarre and striking disorder has reached epidemic 
proportions.  Clinician/researchers report each seeing individually more than 100 patients whose minds 
have split into as many as 60 alter egos. Their case histories are typified by sexual and physical abuse in 
childhood and some have reached notoriety;  in films, like Eve and Sybil and in criminal records, like 
Bianchi, `the Hillside Strangler'.  But does `multiple personality' exist? This monograph takes as its point of 
departure the virtual absence of such patients anywhere except the U.S.A. and even then it is a relatively 
small number of psychologists and psychiatrists who report the overwhelming majority of cases.  The book 
provides the first comprehensive review of the burgeoning literature from the beginning of the century to 
the present and covers more than 300 articles and books. It should prove of interest to psychologists, 
psychiatrists,  psychotherapists and social workers and is an invaluable reference for students on courses in 
clinical and abnormal psychology as well as to practising clinicians and social workers. Following an 
introduction to a selection of the more notable cases a number of critical issues are examined in ensuing 
chapters. These are devoted to problems of definition and differential diagnosis; aetiology; 
psychophysiological,  psychometric and experimental studies; attempts at theoretical explanation and the 
relationship between MPS, hypnosis and dissociation.<BR>
<BR>
The author, a practising clinical psychologist and lecturer in psychopathology, gradually develops the 
hypothesis that MPS is best explained under the rubric of social role theory. It is argued that MPS is a 
culture-bound variant of hysterical psychosis occurring in individuals with high `hypnotisability'. The 
tentative conclusion is that even if one accepts the reality of MPS it is unhelpful to regard it as a discrete 
clinical entity, and it is being grossly overdiagnosed.<BR>

Any service which sees and treats young people with these disorders will find this book useful for both 
beginners and more experienced staff ... The writing is clear, the coverage of both theoretical and most 
practical aspects, sufficiently comprehensive for a multi-disciplinary audience. There are good summaries 
and plenty of references for those wanting more; and case illustrations are well judged in length." - Journal 
of Adolescence<BR>
"This is a well-organized book that presents the considered views of the team from Great Ormond Street 
Children's Hospital .. The book is well produced and edited and full of both scientific sophistication and 
humanity. It is essential reading for anyone who is going to work with such young people." - Journal of 
Family Therapy <BR>
<BR>
This book concentrates on anorexia nervosa and related eating disorders in children. It is the first book that 
looks specifically at childhood onset anorexia nervosa and eating disorders. The Editors' aim has been to 
integrate theory, research and practice. The book shows how varied and complex the eating disorders of 
childhood and early adolescence are. It includes a detailed review of the classification, epidemiology, 
causation and presentation of the various eating disorders. The opening chapter is written by the mother of 
a young sufferer, and describes in detail her experiences as well as those of other mothers in similar 
situations. The latter half of the book is devoted to a very practical description of the treatment techniques 
for these problems. <BR>

<BR>
This is a title in the modular Principles of Psychology series, which is designed for A-level and other 
introductory courses. While normal individuals obviously differ from each other in all sorts of ways, 
psychologists have emphasized differences in intelligence and in personality. This emphasis is reflected in 
the book, in which various different views on intelligence and personality are discussed at length. <BR>
<BR>
Abnormality has always been a source of fascination, although it has proved difficult to form a good 
understanding of why and how abnormality develops. Psychologists have also grappled with other complex 
issues, such as how to classify abnormal individuals and what forms of treatment will prove to be 
beneficial. In spite of the complexities, much progress has  been made. That progress is fully documented 
in the pages of this book.<BR>

"This extremely thoughtful, readable, stimulating, brief volume is part of a series, focusing on psychology, 
that is edited by Eysenck, a British psychologist, and two of his colleagues. It defines the domains of 
psychology, and outlines key approaches, major issues and controversies within psychology...Despite the 
author's personal preference for the approaches of cognitive psychology, his descriptions are extremely 
balanced and fair. They leave the reader with an appreciation of the complexity both of the issues in human 
behavior and of the approaches of relevant research." Thomas Plaut (Department of Health and Human 
Services, Rockville) in Science Books and Films.<BR>
<BR>
This is a title in the modular Principles of Psychology Series which is designed for introductory courses. 
The book provides students who are embarking on psychology courses with the necessary background and 
context. One aspect of this is to consider contemporary psychology in the light of its historical 
development. Another aspect is to examine some of the major controversies which have dominated 
psychology over the centuries. Yet another aspect is to consider some of the major areas of psychology 
(e.g., social, developmental, cognitive) in terms of what they have to offer in our quest for an 
understanding of human behaviour. This book also addresses key issues which need to be considered as 
psychology matures into a fully fledged experimental and scientific discipline. For example, how much do 
experiments carried out under laboratory conditions tell us about how people behave in the real world? 
How far is it ethically permissible for psychologists to go in their pursuit of knowledge? Answers to these, 
and many other, questions are provided in this fascinating book. <BR>

<B>SUSAN E. GATHERCOLE (Lancaster University) and ALAN D. BADDELEY (Director, MRC 
Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge)</B><BR>
<BR>
This book evaluates the involvement of working memory in five central aspects of language processing: 
vocabulary acquisition, speech production, reading development, skilled reading, and comprehension. The 
authors draw upon experimental, neuro- psychological and developmental evidence in a wide-ranging 
evaluation of the contribution of two components of working memory to each aspect of language. The two 
components are the phonological loop, which is specialised for the processing and maintenance of verbal 
material, and the general-purpose processing system of the central executive. A full introduction to the 
application of the working memory model to normal adults, neuropsychological patients and children is 
provided in the two opening chapters. Non-experts within this area will find these chapters particularly 
useful in providing a clear statement of the current theoretical and empirical status of the working memory 
model. Each of the following chapters examines the involvement of working memory in one specialised 
aspect of language processing, in each case integrating the available experimental, neuropsychological and 
developmental evidence. The book will therefore be of direct relevance to researchers interested in both 
language processing and memory.<BR>
<BR>
Working Memory and Language is unique in that it draws together findings from normal adults, brain-
damaged patients, and children. For each of these populations, working memory involvement in language 
processing ranging from the speech production to comprehension are evaluated. Working Memory and 
Language provides a comprehensive analysis of just what roles working memory does play in the 
processing of language. <BR>

New technology has profound effects on many aspects of organizational functioning, and psychologists 
should be involved in the issues raised by its introduction and continued use within the organizations. This 
special issue of the journal Applied Psychology: An International Review discusses the different 
contributions psychologists may make. Four types of contributions are distinguished: socio- psychological 
and ergonomic advice geared to task design and the man-machine interface; professional organizational 
advice regarding the adaption of new information systems to relevant organizational characteristics; 
process consultation; advice and assistance in retraining, transfers, etc. The articles in this volume discuss 
these contributions, and other issues, from both theoretical and practical standpoints.<BR>

<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Arguing that hypnosis is not in itself a therapy but rather an adjunct to other procedures in 
therapy, Gibson and Heap offer a comprehensive review of its applications for psychological 
disorders and medical conditions...This brief but comprehensive and well written treatise is 
recommended for both professionals and general readers interested in the use of hypnosis in therapy." 
<B>Choice (Social &amp  Behavioural Sciences, Psychology)
</B></UL>
<BR>
This book covers a comprehensive range of the applications of hypnotic techniques in therapy for 
psychological disorders, and medical conditions where such techniques are a valuable adjunct. In recent 
years psychologists, medical doctors, dentists and allied professional workers have come to make 
increasing use of hypnosis in their work, and there is now a considerable amount of relevant research 
literature available in journals. Such literature is reviewed, and serves as a practical guide for professionals.  
The book begins by explaining what is meant by hypnosis today, and traces its historical background. 
Some fundamental questions such as individual differences in susceptibility to hypnosis are discussed in 
relation to therapy. Separate chapters are devoted to the key topics of behaviour therapy, different forms of 
psychotherapy, psychosomatic medicine, the treatment of pain, and applications in medical and surgical 
procedures. The modern status of hypnotic techniques in obstetrics and in dentistry is reviewed, and a 
separate chapter on the use of hypnosis with children will be of special interest to educational and clinical 
psychologists. A final chapter reviews the use of hypnosis by various professions and para-medical 
disciplines, and discusses the possible abuses that may arise both through unqualified people seeking to 
practice "hypnotherapy", and by professionals acting outside their proper range of competence.  <BR>

EDMUND J.S. SONUGA-BARKE (Southampton University), PAUL WEBLEY (Exeter University) 
<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Sonuga-Barke and Webley explore how children learn to make decisions about the resources 
available to them; learn the relationship between current and future choices; and use strategies to 
preserve those resources. They relate this development to the children's social world; including 
cultural expectations to behave economically, and the information provided by parents and banks. To 
explore these issues the authors create a number of cleverly designed games where children had to 
make decisions about saving and spending tokens they collected." <B>Rachel Wright (Institute of 
Education) in the International Journal of Early Childhood, 1994</B>.
</UL>
<BR>
This book presents an alternative approach to the study of the emergence of economic awareness during 
childhood: a new developmental economic psychology. In the past, attempts to study the emergence of 
children's economic consciousness have failed to take account of the practical nature of the "economic" in 
the history of western cultures. Economic socialization has been seen as the acquisition of abstract 
knowledge about the institutions of adult economic culture. The child has been seen as a spectator, 
acquiring knowledge of that culture, but never really part of it.<BR>
<BR>
However, economic actions, in essence, are directed not towards the attainment of knowledge but rather 
towards thepractical solution of problems of resource allocation imposed by constraint. Children, just like 
adults, are faced with practical problems of resource allocation. Their response to these problems may be 
different from those of adults but no less "economic" for that.<BR>
<BR>
This realization forms the heart of this book. In it children are seen as both inhabitants of their own 
"playground" economic sub-culture and actors in the wider economic world of adults, solving, or 
attempting to solve, practical economic problems. In order to highlight this "child centered" approach the 
authors studied the way children tackle the particular problems posed by limitations of income. How do 
children learn, a) the relationship between choices available in the present and the future, b) to spread their 
limited financial resources over time into the future and c) about the strategies, such as banking, that allow 
them to protect those resources from threats and temptations? In short, how do children learn to save?<BR>
<BR>
This volume goes some way to answering these and related questions and in so doing sets up an alternative 
framework for the study of the emergence of economic awareness. <BR>

<B>A Special Case for Developmental Psychology?</B></CENTER><BR>

CHRISTINE J. HOWE (University of Strathclyde)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Overall this book is interesting and stimulating, and should be read by persons having more 
than just an interest in language acquisition. The author should be applauded on her knowledge and 
integration of the literature, and commended for her originality and insight into the language 
acquisition process." Susan Moon Meyer (Kutztown University) in Child Language Teaching and 
Therapy, 1994.
<LI>
<LI>"...the material presented here will be of interest to anyone working in the field of early language 
acquisition, particularly if they approach the topic from a cognitive development perspective...One 
has the feeling that Howe assembled copies of every relevant piece of research and immersed herself 
in them as she worked her way through the various arguments assembled to debate the nativist 
position on language acquisition...Howe does present a good case for questioning the innateness 
hypothesis in language learning, and her essay should interest anyone looking for arguments and 
evidence to refute this theoretical position." Sandra Bochner in Educational Psychology, 1994.
</UL>
<BR>
The starting place for this book is the notion, current in the literature for around thirty years, that children 
could not learn their native language without substantial innate knowledge of its grammatical structure. It is 
argued that the notion is as problematic for contemporary theories of development as it was for theories of 
the past. Accepting this, the book attempts an in-depth study of the notion's credibility.<BR>
<BR>
Central to the book's argument is the conclusion that the innateness hypothesis runs into two major 
problems. First, its proponents are too ready to treat children as embryonic linguists, concerned  with the 
representation of sentences as an end in itself. A more realistic approach would be to regard children as 
communication engineers, storing sentences to optimise the production and retrieval of meaning. Second, 
even when the communication analogy is adopted, it is glibly assumed that the meanings children impute 
will be the ones adults intend. <BR>
<BR>
One of the book's major contentions is that a careful reading of contemporary research suggests that the 
meanings may differ considerably.  Identifying such problems, the book considers how development 
should proceed, given learning along communication lines and a more plausible analysis of meaning. It 
makes detailed predictions about what would be anticipated given no innate knowledge of grammar. 
Focusing on English but giving full acknowledgement to cross-linguistic research, it concludes that the 
predictions are consistent with both the known timescale of learning and the established facts about 
children's knowledge. Thus, the book aspires to a serious challenge to the innateness hypothesis via, as its 
final chapter will argue, a model which is much more reassuring to psychological theory. <BR>

D. SLEEMAN &amp  N.O. BERNSEN<BR>
<BR>
This book consists of a series of in-depth reviews of seven major subareas in Artificial Intelligence, by well 
known European workers. The areas featured are Knowledge Acquisition; Logic Programming and 
Representation; Machine Learning; Natural Language; Vision; the design of an AI Programming 
Environment; and an important application area for AI, namely Medicine. These topics are all ones in 
which European workers have made significant contributions, but the reviews seek to give a 
comprehensive review of the subfield. The volume also contains an Introduction by the Editor which 
attempts to sketch the broader aims of AI, and show how activities in the several subareas fit into this 
broader perspective.<BR>
<BR>
It is hoped that the volume will be useful both to fellow AI workers, and to those who work in other 
Cognitive Science disciplines who wish to be appraised of recent developments in these subareas of AI.

<B>Edited by GERRY ALTMANN</B><BR>
<BR>
Parsing and Interpretation considers a range of topics concerned with surface structure, parsing and 
sentence interpretation. The chapters cover both theoretical and methodological aspects of the research in 
this area. Topics include the processing of local syntactic ambiguity, with extensive discussion of the 
arguments both for and against the existence of purely structural parsing strategies. Also included is some 
of the debate concerning the methodological basis of the claims being made in this area. The role of 
subcategorization information, and the time-course of its influence during parsing is considered, as well as 
the role of thematic information. This latter topic is also considered from the perspective of Parallel 
Distributed Processing systems, and the computational architectures which might be suited to modelling 
the empirical data. A number of chapters deal with various aspects of noun phrase interpretation, ranging 
from extensive review of the studies dealing with the processing of empty categories (or "filler-gap" 
dependencies), to questions concerned with the immediacy of anaphoric processing, and the relationship 
between this and the on-line construction of discourse-models. This collection will be of interest to 
researchers and students who are concerned with the psychology of sentence processing.<BR>

MARC N. RICHELLE (University of Li)<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Richelle's book about Skinner is one of the best introductions to Skinner's work there is around. 
I recommend it to all who want to know more about Skinner, the psychology of learning, the roots of 
behaviour therapy, the problem of the relations of cognitions and behaviour, and why some people 
keep misunderstanding behaviour therapy, and don't want to learn. Reading Richelle's book will 
enrich you. <B>Sten Ronnberg (Stockholm University) in the Scandinavian Journal of 
Behaviour Therapy, 1993. </B>
</UL>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"Reading a work constucted with attention to pace and clarity, with respect for the reader and the 
subject matter , and with generosity toward opposing points of view is always a pleasant surprise. 
Marc N. Richelle has provided such an experience in his new book B.F. Skinner: A 
Reappraisal.Richelle provides a rich understanding of Skinner's view of modern psychology as 'the 
study of the breath of life, of animation.' The book is a fitting and elegant tribute to the enduring 
contributions of B.F. Skinner." <B>James A. Mulick (The Ohio State University) in Division 25 
Recorder, The Experimental Analysis of Behavior Division of the APA.
</B></UL>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>"A book for every major library, this is a highly readable critical appraisal of the work of 
Skinner in the context of  20th-century psychology, US and European. Nonspecialists will learn a 
great deal about the psychological sciences in general as well as gain some appreciation of the 
complex issues underlying controversies surrounding Skinner's work. Scholars in many fields, 
including psychologists, behaviour analysts, and cognitive scientists - as well as those in related fields 
such as evolutionary biology, philosophy of science, and neurobiology - can make good use of this 
work. Richelle is a careful and widely read scholar who compares and contrasts, in a balanced and 
clear manner, Skinner's views to those of writers in all of those fields." <B>S.S. Glenn (University of 
North Texas) in Choice, 1994</B>.
</UL>
<BR>
B.F. Skinner died in August 1990. He had been praised as one of the most influential psychologists of this 
century, but was also attacked by a variety of opponents within and outside the field of psychology. This 
introduction to his work is first of all a guide to a correct reading of his writings, a reading void of the 
distortions and misinterpretations often conveyed by many commentators, including psychologists. It 
frames Skinner's contributions with reference to major European traditions in psychological sciences, 
namely Pavlov, Freud, Lorenz and Piaget. Crucial aspects of Skinner's theory and methodological stands 
are discussed in the context of contemporary debates: special attention is devoted to the relation of 
psychology with biology and the neurosciences, to the cognitivist movement, to the status of language and 
to the explanation of novelty and creativity in human behaviour. Finally, Skinner's social and political 
philosophy is presented with an emphasis on the provocative aspects of an analysis of current social 
practices which fail to solve most of the urgent problems humankind is confronted with today. <BR>
<BR>
Both in science proper and in human affairs at large, Skinner's thought is shown to be, not behind, as is 
often claimed, but on the contrary ahead of the times, be it in his interactive view of linguistic 
communication, in his very modern use of the evolutionary analogy to explain the dynamics of behaviour, 
or in his vision of ecological constraints.  Written by a European psychologist, the book departs from 
traditional presentations of Skinner's work in the frame of American psychology. It will provide the reader, 
who is unfamiliar with the great behaviourist's writings, a concise yet in-depth introduction to his 
work.<BR>

<BR>
The growing diversity and the growing number of psychologists in the world could be seen as a threat to 
the unity of the field. This is not a theoretical issue as we are facing more and more practical problems due 
to: (1) the difficulty for psychologists active in various sub-disciplines to share common values; (2) 
contradictory opinions on what should be a more common basis of knowledge for all psychology students; 
and (3) more and more difficulty when we try to agree on a "large" definition of what is psychology.<BR>
<BR>
This special issue is aimed at describing the present state of  the problem of the "Unity of Psychology" in 
different parts o the world, as seen by psychologists belonging to various sub-fields, and approached from 
several points of view. Even if there is no general agreement on a model of reunification of psychology, the 
dangers linked to a breaking up of psychology into several applied domains and of research in psychology 
into several fields no longer able to cross-fertilize one another is outlined. <BR>

<TITLE>WOMEN AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000">
<BR>
<CENTER><H3>WOMEN AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE</H3></CENTER>
RAYMOND JACK (University of East Anglia)<BR>
<BR>
Attempted suicide began to increase inexorably in western societies following World War Two. In Britain 
it reached epidemic proportions in 1976, when 120,000 cases were reported. More accurately termed "self-
poisoning" as the majority of cases involve deliberate, non-fatal overdosing on pills, this remarkable social-
medical phenomenon remains without any generally accepted explanation. Women and Attempted Suicide 
suggests that two factors have contributed to this failure - the neglect of gender issues and the influence of 
psychiatry on explanations of deviant behaviour.<BR>
<BR>
Self-poisoning is a predominantly female phenomenon - women outnumbering men often by more than 
2:1. Psychotropic drugs are commonly employed in self-poisoning and here too women predominate 
among psychotropic recipients by 2:1. As the rate of psychotropic prescription fluctuates so too does the 
rate of female self-poisoning. Despite these facts gender issues are almost entirely neglected in a literature 
dominated by psychiatry. A largely fruitless search for psychopathology in self-poisoning has diverted 
attention from social factors whilst failing to account for one its most definitive characteristics - the female 
predominance. Women and Attempted Suicide offers a new psycho-social explanation based on the theory 
of Causal Attribution. This suggests that as a result of their socialisation individuals differ in the causes to 
which they attribute their problems and that some causal attributions are more helpful than others in coping 
with problems. The book argues that certain women - and others such as the unemployed and 
underprivileged who have limited control over their lives - acquire a "helpless" attributional style. This 
renders them less able to cope with adversity, more likely to turn to doctors for help when it befalls them, 
and more likely to receive psychotropics when doing so. When pills fail to solve problems, helplessness 
may turn to hopelessness and self-poisoning.<BR>

<LI>"I would say that Clement's description of mathematics is outstanding in its clarity and in the 
way it tears away the cloak of mysticism which surrounds mathematical terms used so widely in 
journals like the Journal of the Optical Society of America. For that alone, the price of the book is 
remarkably good value for money.~ Malcolm James Cook in Optometry Today 
<LI>~The book could be invaluable as a reference work. Previously, one had to flick through old 
maths textbooks to relearn (or learn!) some maths that would make a piece of work in vision 
completely understandable. With the publication of this book, the author has brought together in one 
place virtually all the maths you will need in order to follow current research in the visual sciences.~ 
Trevor Hine in Perception.
</UL>
<BR>
Different animals have different visual systems and so presumably have different ways of seeing. How 
does the way in which we see depend on the optical, neural and motor components of our visual systems? 
The mathematical tools needed to answer this question are introduced in this book. Elementary linear 
algebra is used to describe the transformation of the stimulus that occurs in the formation of the optical, 
neural and motor images in the human visual system. The distinctive feature of the approach is that 
transformations are specified with enough rigour for readers to be able to set up their own models and 
generate predictions from them. Underlying the approach of this book is the goal of providing a self-
contained source for the derivation of the basic equations of vision science. An introductory section on  
vector and matrix algebra covers the mathematical techniques which are applied to both sensory and motor 
aspects of the visual system, and the intervening steps in the mathematical arguments are given in full, in 
order to make the derivation of the equations easier to follow. A subsidiary goal of this book is to 
demonstrate the utility of current desktop computer packages which make the application of mathematics 
very easy. All the numerical results were produced using only a spreadsheet or mathematics package, and 
example calculations are included in the text. <BR>

<UL>
<LI>"Brewin succeeds in covering in one text most of the major issues and controversies in cognitive 
and social psychology that are relevant to clinical issues... This volume will be of great value to 
clinicians, researchers, and students." <B>Professor Aaron T. Beck, University of Pennsylvania,  
Philadelphia</B>
<LI>"...I think Chris Brewin has done a first class job of integrating a very diverse literature. His style 
is good and readable. His references are impressively up-to-date; indeed, so much so that this book 
will be an invaluable source for some years to come."  <B>Dr. Mark Williams, MRC Applied 
Psychology Unit, Cambridge
</B><LI>"...There does not presently exist as comprehensive a coverage of theoretical and empirical 
work on cognition relevant to clinical psychology as this book contains. It is a scholarly, up-to-date 
summary of research and theory that consistently draws out implications for clinical understanding 
and practice."  <B>Professor Constance Hammen, University of California, Los Angeles</B>
</UL>
<BR>
This is the first textbook to review and integrate the cognitive theories underlying the practice of modern 
clinical psychology. Written clearly, it uses clinical examples to relate to what therapists actually do. It 
describes the strengths and weaknesses of the theories and develops a common framework drawn from 
research in social and cognitive psychology to explain the mechanisms of behavioral and cognitive 
therapy. Among the topics covered are the validity of self-reports, experimental investigations of 
nonconscious processes, cognitive theories of conditioning, the relation between cognition and emotional 
disorders such as anxiety and depression, self-esteem and the development of self-schema, self-efficacy, 
explanation and causal attribution, personal values and goals, self-regulation and the techniques of 
cognitive therapy. This textbook is intended for advanced undergraduate and postgraduate courses in 
clinical and abnormal psychology. Its practical focus will also make it of particular interest to practising 
clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals. <BR>

<B>A Special Issue of Applied Psychology: An International Review</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Maurice de Montmollin (Universite Paris-Nord and Mast-Group), Guest Ed.<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this special issue of the International Journal of Applied Psychology on Skills, 
Qualifications and Employment is to offer a comparison of approaches of different disciplines to human 
work in the context of Information Technology.<BR>
<BR>
An introduction by the guest editor (M. de Montmollin, France) proposes a general frame for such a 
comparison of the disciplines concerned, namely industrial and organizational psychology, human 
resources management, industrial sociology, labour market economics, artificial intelligence and 
ergonomics. The conclusion stresses the difficulties of cross- fertilization between the disciplines, which 
hopefully could be helped by precise epistemological discussions of the diverse methods of "work 
analysis". The subsequent original contributions are balanced between more theoretical and methodological 
papers (by J. Leplat, France, on "Skills and Tacit Skills", S. Wood, England, on "Tacit Skills and Japanese 
Management" and D. van der Werf, The Netherlands, on "Work, Competencies and Learning Scenarios for 
the Future"), versus data based research papers (by P. Rivard, France, on the evolution and social features 
of the new professions in the computer area; J. Laupretre, France, on Human Resources in a large bank; T. 
Brady, England, and P. Nijkamp, the Netherlands, on economic aspects, respectively "skill shortage" and 
"geographical dimensions"). Of interest to industrial and work psychologists, personnel managers, and 
specialists in organizational development. <BR>

JEFFREY A. GRAY (Institute of Psychiatry, University of London), Guest Ed.<BR>
Recent analyses of the relationships between cognition and emotion based upon experimental studies of 
human subjects have tended to proceed in virtually complete isolation from data and theory derived from 
work with animals. Partly as a consequence of this isolation, such analyses have had little contact with 
relevant biological or neurological research. The articles in this special issue of Cognition and Emotion aim 
to redress this balance. They present a number of diverse, but related, points of view on the neurobiology 
and neuropsychology of emotion, cognition and their interface. The contributors are all distinguished 
scientists who are actively involved in both empirical and theoretical research in this field. <BR>

<CENTER><H3>AUDIT IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES</H3></CENTER>
JENNY FIRTH-COZENS (Principal Research Fellow in Clinical Audit at the University of Leeds)<BR>
<BR>
At last, a book to take practitioners in the mental health field through the various steps involved in 
successful clinical audit. This book, including its team and individual exercises, is designed to help select 
topics for audit, to understand the methods most appropriate, to set standards, understand the significance 
of outcomes, and to bring about changes as a result. It is a practical guide to the analysis of health care, 
both for those working within a professional group, and for those in multidisciplinary teams. The book will 
be invaluable for all mental health professionals - psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, occupational 
therapists, psychiatric social workers - and purchaser or provider managers interested in clinical audit and 
the measurement of quality more generally. <BR>
<BR>
About the Author: Dr. Jenny Firth-Cozens, A Chartered Clinical and Occupational Psychologist, has been 
involved in the evaluation of clinical practice for a number of years, and was Regional Audit coordinator 
for the Yorkshire Regional Health Authority. As Principal Research Fellow in Clinical Audit at the  
University of Leeds, she runs courses and workshops on medical and clinical audit for various professional 
groups and for multidisciplinary teams. In her consultancy practice she works with local audit committees 
on the facilitation of audit, and with health service and community teams on strategic issues, evaluation, 
and team development. <BR>

<B>A Special Issue of Cognitive Neuropsychology</B><BR>
<B>SHANE M. O'MARA (University of Dublin, Trinity College), V. WALSH (University of 
Oxford) Eds. </B><BR>
<BR>
The theme of this Special Issue is one that is ill-served by the existing neuropsychological literature. A 
publication that collates reviews of the developmental, physiological, clinical and cognitive aspects of this 
topic is therefore timely and would prove valuable to clinicians, researchers and students alike. The 
underlying problem addressed by the invited contributors is how attention is manifest in the intact brain, 
and how disorders of attention present themselves in the damaged brain.<BR>
<BR>
The topics to be covered will range from the physiology of attention (as revealed by single unit recording 
studies of extra-striate cortex of monkeys and PET scans in humans and low frequency EEG recordings) to 
disorders of attention after brain damage (e.g. stroke) and chronic pathological disorders of the brain (e.g. 
dyslexia and mental retardation). The range of contributions to the Special Issue demonstrates that the  inds 
of attentional processing required are determined by the task in hand. Correspondingly the volume 
discusses attention in the parietal, temporal and frontal lobes of the human and macaque brain, investigated 
by clinical, electrophysiological and behavioural methods. Attentional processes are also shown to be 
distributed in the brain and the effects of diminished attentional capacities which do not result from focal 
brain lesions are discussed in the context of mental retardation and dyslexia.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>~If I or any of my family ever have a head injury, I would want every member of staff involved 
to have read this extremely impressive book. I know of no other book which combines scientific 
approach with a fund of clinical wisdom and extremely useful recommendations as to the 
management and treatment of a huge range of problems associated with traumatic brain injury. I think 
that this book deserves an extremely wide readership, as there is no existing textbook of this kind 
available to my knowledge. In summary, this is a really excellent piece of work which throbs with the 
years of clinical experience, energy and humanity which is clearly behind it. I congratulate the 
authors."  <B>Ian Robertson, MRC Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge 
</B></UL>
<BR>
All practitioners who work with traumatically brain injured (TBI) individuals and their families will find 
this book an invaluable resource. Based on scientific evidence and extensive clinical experience, it provides 
comprehensive and practical guidelines for the assessment and management of a wide range of problems 
associated with TBI.  The book begins with a discussion of the epidemiology, pathophysiology and 
sequelae of TBI. It outlines the recommended approach to rehabilitation, termed the REAL approach, 
signifying Rehabilitation for Everyday Adaptive Living. The essence of this approach is effective 
teamwork, focusing on the real world, involvement of the injured person and family, and taking a long-
term view of the rehabilitation process. <BR>
<BR>
Reflecting the expertise of the authors in the domains of clinical neuropsychology, occupational therapy 
and speech pathology, the book covers a broad spectrum of issues confronting clinicians following TBI, 
beginning with the assessment and management of coma, minimally responsive states and post-traumatic 
amnesia. it provides guidelines for assessing and managing cognitive problems, communication and 
interpersonal difficulties and behaviour change.  Issues involved in returning to the community are 
addressed, including return to independent living, work, study, leisure interests and driving. The nature and 
methods of assisting with a range of adjustment difficulties are explored, including problems with self-
awareness and self-esteem, depression, anxiety, anger control, relationship problems and sexual 
difficulties. <BR>
<BR>
The impact of TBI on families, caregivers and others close to the injured person is examined, and methods 
of minimising family stress are outlined. The book finishes with a discussion of the special needs of 
children who sustain TBI.  <BR>
