discovered at the direction of the SUPERVISOR.                                  
                                                                                
         3.3.2  The quick response team members shall have with them (or        
readily accessible), the tools of their trade for immediate use in the          
correction of discrepancies.                                                    
                                                                                
4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  The Light-Off Examination (LOE) is a comprehensive examination of the  
ship in the key areas of:  The level of knowledge and fire fighting capability  
of propulsion plant personnel; the adequacy of Engineering Department           
administrative programs and procedures; the material readiness of the           
propulsion plant; and the state of cleanliness and preservation of main         
propulsion and auxiliary machinery spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by     
the Propulsion Examining Board (PEB) or the Type Commander Staff.  The          
examination will be conducted immediately prior to scheduled diesel engine      
light-off and it must be concluded successfully prior to diesel engine          
light-off.  The material portion examination usually takes less than 12 hours.  
If restrictive discrepancies are identified, those discrepancies must be        
corrected prior to diesel engine light-off.                                     
                                                                                
    4.2  The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team and accomplish a      
preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with Ship's Force eight to four       
weeks prior to the LOE to determine and record discrepancies which would        
impact upon the LOE.  The pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will  
result in the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work considered    
necessary to support a successful Light-Off Examination.  Each discrepancy      
noted in the inspection will be described in simple terms on a four-part,       
serialized form.  The form will identify the general location of the            
discrepancy and the associated work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth     
copy of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be hung by    
the SUPERVISOR'S inspection team in the immediate proximity of the discrepancy  
(on the deficient item itself, when practical).  Upon completion of the         
Pre-LOE the Supervisor will identify contractor responsible discrepancies to    
the contractor.  Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the  
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's Force.  That       
portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by the Ship's Force will be    
considered for accomplishment by the contractor.                                
                                                                                
         4.2.1  Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection that        
additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be similarly identified and  
screened.

         3.4.1  CHECK POINT is a phrase inserted in a Work Item to establish a  
point in the sequence of accomplishment of work at which time the SUPERVISOR    
shall be notified to permit observation of a specific test or inspection by     
the Government.

                3.4.2.1  Where the words CHECK POINT precede tests or           
inspections in a Work Item which are applicable to more than one action, the    
CHECK POINT shall identify the action required, e.g., CHECK POINT (Hydrostatic  
Test).  When more than one unit is involved, the CHECK POINT requirement        
applies to each unit.

                3.4.2.3  Proceed with the test or inspection if the SUPERVISOR  
is not present, provided the required advance notice has been furnished to the  
SUPERVISOR and the contractor has completed and documented his preceding tests  
and inspections.                                                                
                                                                                
                3.4.2.4  In the event that work cannot be completed to a CHECK  
POINT for any reason (such as late delivery of material or interfacing of       
related Work Items), and work progress would be delayed in waiting for total    
completion of work to the CHECK POINT, the SUPERVISOR, upon notification, may   
conduct a partial inspection of the work.  Notify the SUPERVISOR when the       
incomplete work is completed and ready for the remainder of the inspection or   
test.  Note partial inspections on the inspection form.                         
                                                                                
         3.4.3  CHECK POINT requirements for tests or inspections involving a   
subcontractor shall be invoked by the contractor's purchase order or otherwise  
described such that the requirements of 3.4.2 are met.

                3.4.3.2  The contractor may delegate responsibility to          
subcontractors only for specific tests and inspections performed at plants      
located outside a 50-mile radius from the contractor's plant; however, the      
CHECK POINT notification requirements shall not be delegated.                   
                                                                                
                3.4.3.3  Submit one legible copy of the technical               
specification portion of those purchase orders which involve CHECK POINTs to    
the SUPERVISOR prior to the start of work by the subcontractor.  For work       
being accomplished by subcontractors located outside a 50-mile radius from the  
contractor's plant, submit purchase orders to the SUPERVISOR prior to shipment  
of purchase order and equipment from the contractor's facility.

         3.2.1  Except for propellers, if the design operating speed of the     
component to be balanced is less than 150 revolutions per minute (RPM), the     
rotor including shaft shall be balanced by symmetrically supporting the rotor   
on two knife edges and applying a correction to attain a gravity balance.       
                                                                                
         3.2.2  Except for propellers, if the design operating speed of the     
component to be balanced is equal to or greater than 150 RPM, the rotor         
including shaft shall be balanced with equipment which requires rotation of     
the work piece.                                                                 
                                                                                
         3.2.3  Propellers shall be statically balanced in a single plane by    
rotating on dynamic equipment, using a constant rotational speed, in order to   
ensure an accurate static balance.  Controllable pitch propeller blades shall   
be single plane balanced in hub sets on a dummy hub.

balance - sensitivity level one-half of the allowable unbalance at the chosen   
rotational speed.                                                               
                                                                                
                3.2.3.2  The allowable unbalance criteria for the propeller     
shall be as specified on the applicable propeller drawing.  In the absence of   
an applicable propeller drawing, the allowable unbalance shall be determined    
by the appropriate formula in 3.2.5.

4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  The magnetic field of mine warfare ships and craft consists of the     
superposition of the magnetic field from four basic sources:  ferrous field,    
eddy current field, ship service stray field, and minesweep generator stray     
field.  The stray field sources are the electric currents in cables and wiring  
associated with the operation of the equipment of the ship or craft.  The       
ferrous field and eddy current field sources are as follows:                    
                                                                                
         4.1.1  Ferrous Field Source:  The ferrous field sources are the items  
on or part of the ship or craft which use a material in their construction      
that exhibits a relative magnetic permeability different than 1.0, the          
relative magnetic permeability of air.  Each ferrous field source acts like a   
bar magnet whose magnetic field depends upon the material's relative magnetic   
permeability, volume (not mass), and shape of the earth's magnetic field.  At   
a point or location external to a ferrous field source, the magnetic field of   
this source is essentially the same whether the source is hollow (such as a     
block or pedestal).  A material whose relative magnetic permeability is 2.0 or  
less is arbitrarily defined to be nonmagnetic when used in conjunction with     
mine warfare ships and craft; otherwise, the material is said to be magnetic.   
Whether the material of an item is classified magnetic or nonmagnetic,          
according to the above arbitrary definition, a change in relative magnetic      
permeability of the material will, in general, result in a change in the        
magnetic field associated with this item.                                       
                                                                                
         4.1.2  Eddy Current Field Source:  The eddy current field sources are  
the items on or part of the ship or craft which use a material in their         
construction that exhibits an electrical conductivity.  A material whose        
electrical conductivity is less than 0.5 percent of the electrical              
conductivity of copper (1.7241 x 10-6 ohm-cm at 20 degrees Centigrade) is       
arbitrarily defined to be nonconductive when used in conjunction with mine      
warfare ships and craft; otherwise, the material is said to be electrically     
conductive.  Each eddy current field source acts like a generator when it       
oscillates in the earth's magnetic field due to the rolling and pitching of     
the ship or craft.  The current in this source, resulting from the generator    
action, has associated with it a magnetic field - an eddy current field.  The   
magnitude of this field is dependent upon the conductivity of the material,     
the size of the electrical path in the material, the cross-sectional area of    
the electrical path, and the orientation of the source with respect to the      
earth's magnetic field due to the rolling and pitching of the ship or craft.    
The current in this source, resulting from the generator action, has            
associated with it a magnetic field - an eddy current field.  The magnitude of  
this field is dependent upon the conductivity of the material, the size of the  
electrical path in the material, the cross-sectional area of the electrical     
path, and the orientation of the source with respect to the earth's magnetic    
field.                                                                          
                                                                                
         4.1.3  If an item is both highly magnetic and electrically             
conductive, such as mild steel or steel, the ferrous field will mask out the    
eddy current field.  If an electrically conductive item is located inside a     
highly magnetic enclosure, such as mild steel or steel, the enclosure will      
mask the magnetic effects of its contents and will appear as if it were a       
solid magnetic block.                                                           
                                                                                
    4.2  The SUPERVISOR will provide written direction for accomplishment of    
one of the following prior to installation of existing or new                   
material/equipment as a result of the deviation request.                        
                                                                                
         4.2.1  Authorization for deviation request.                            
                                                                                
         4.2.2  Identification and authorization of an acceptable Contractor    
Furnished Material (CFM) substitute material or equipment.                      
                                                                                
         4.2.3  Receipt of an acceptable Government Furnished Material (GFM)    
substitute material or equipment.                                               
                                                                                
         4.2.4  Technical direction and information for manufacturing of        
acceptable material or equipment.                                               
                                                                                
         4.2.5  Other direction as determined acceptable by the ship class      
planning yard or higher authority.

         3.12.1 The MIL-P-24441 coatings mixing ratio is one-to-one by volume.  
The components of the various formulas are not interchangeable.                 
                                                                                
         3.12.2 Blend each component thoroughly prior to mixing the             
components.  After mixing equal volumes of the two components, the mixture      
must be thoroughly stirred, and the stand-in times listed below must be         
observed.                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.12.2.1 Stand-in time (induction time) is defined as the time  
immediately following the mixing of the components A and B during which the     
critical reaction period of these components is initiated and is essential to   
the complete curing of the coating.  During stand-in time the mixture must be   
thoroughly stirred at least once every 20 minutes to avoid hot spots caused by  
localized overheating from the chemical reaction.

         3.12.3 Apply the first coat of MIL-P-15931 (Formulas 121/129)          
anti-fouling paint when the last coat of epoxy paint is still slightly tacky    
(approximately four to six hours after paint application).  If the epoxy is     
hard (usually eight hours after application), apply a tack coat of epoxy        
paint one to two mils WFT over previously painted surfaces.  Allow to dry four  
hours and apply the anti-fouling paint.  Above also applies to application of   
any non-epoxy system over an epoxy coating.                                     
                                                                                
                3.12.3.1 Tacky is defined as that curing (drying) stage when a  
fingertip pressed lightly against the film leaves only a slight impression and  
none of the film sticks to the finger.                                          
                                                                                
                3.12.3.2 If more than seven days elapse between preservation    
coatings of epoxy, the surfaces shall be cleaned with fresh water and           
detergent and rinsed with fresh water.  Lightly sand (scarify) the surface and  
wipe with a solvent.  Apply a tack coat, one to two mils WFT, of the last coat  
applied within four hours prior to applying the next full coat of the system.

     below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.                                               
                                                                                
(5)  For seven-year service life, increase each AF coat of BRA 540/542 (or      
     640/642) (Line 6) and each AF coat of ABC 3 (Line 7) by one mil to total   
     of 20 mils DFT - 2 mils for the non-ablative AF and 18 mils for the BRA    
     540/542 (or 640/642) and ABC 3.                                            
                                                                                
(6)  The maximum allowable dry film thickness is two times minimum, i.e., 5     
     mils minimum DFT has a 10 mil maximum.                                     
                                                                                
(7)  To ensure a continuous primer base, areas adjacent to those being coated   
       with proprietary primer and non-skid listed on QPL's for MIL-C-24667,    
     MIL-D-23003, or MIL-D-24483, shall be coated with the same primer and      
     compatible topcoat.                                                        
                                                                                
(8)  For horizontal surfaces, intermediate coats are not needed when non-skid   
     primer qualified to the QPL is applied with the non-skid system.           
                                                                                
(9)  DOD-E-24607, chlorinated alkyd, may also be used.  DOD-E-24607 must be     
     used if surface and ambient temperature are less than 50 degrees           
      Fahrenheit.                                                               
                                                                                
(10) For MIL-P-23236, Types I, III, or IV shall be used in fuel/salt water      
     ballast service.  Qualified paint systems additionally designated Class    
     One may be used with the qualified shop primer - this is generally a new   
     construction issue.  Qualified paint systems designated Class 2 are only   
     for salt water ballast tanks - no exposure to fuels or other hydrocarbons  
     is permitted.                                                              
                                                                                
(11) Coating to be applied in accordance with data sheet.  The maximum coating  
      thickness will be the minimum plus 150 percent of minimum, i.e., for 8    
     mils this will be 8 plus 12 (for maximum allowable of 20 mils).            
                                                                                
(12) Total system (Columns B plus C plus E or F) shall be 20 mils DFT minimum   
      and 25 mils DFT maximum.                                                  
                                                                                
(13) Anchors below lower boottopping limit shall be painted in accordance with  
     normal underwater hull anti-corrosion/anti-fouling system.                 
                                                                                
(14) For MSO, MCM, and MHC ships, use black walnut shells conforming to         
     A-A-1722, Type II, for abrasive blast media.                               
                                                                                
(15) Color coating shall be in accordance with NSTM Chapter 581 unless          
       otherwise directed by the Work Item.                                     
                                                                                
(16) Apply one mist coat (1-2 mils) of primer after blast and prior to          
       remaining coats where invoking Work Item requires anchor chain           
     inspections prior to preservation.                                         
                                                                                
(17) Colors shown in Chapter 631, Tables 631-8-13 and 631-8-14, shall be        
     specified  by TYCOM or ship's Commanding Officer per Chapter 631-8.23.4.   
                                                                                
(18) Restore each compartment marking in accordance with 2.f and 2.g.           
                                                                                
(19) MIL-C-24667, MIL-D-23003, and MIL-D-24483 non-skid systems shall be        
     applied as complete systems (primer, intermediate coat when MIL-C-24667    
     Type III coatings are invoked, non-skid, and color topping) from the same  
     manufacturer.  MIL-C-24667, Type I, when required, shall be specified in   
     the invoking Work Item.                                                    
                                                                                
(20) Prior to accomplishing painting of wooden underwater hulls, allow the      
     hull to dry to a moisture content of 15 percent unless otherwise directed  
     by the paint manufacturer's instructions.  Readings shall be taken with    
     an electronic moisture meter, Sovereigh Moisture Master or equal.  Cover   
     grounding plates and zincs prior to painting.                              
                                                                                
(21) Blasted surface metal must be degreased following walnut shell blasting.   
     Even traces of residual oil will degrade coating adhesion.  Optimum        
     method is to wipe down the blasted surface with a 1:1 solvent mixture by   
     volume of methyl ethyl ketone and mineral spirits.  Appropriate safety     
     precautions for working with flammable solvents must be enforced.          
     Alternate procedure is a vigorous soap and water wash followed by          
     pressurized fresh water rinse.  Do not use a detergent and fresh water     
     washdown when using aluminum oxide as an abrasive blast medium.            
                                                                                
(22) Blasted surface must be cleaned to near white surface finish, leaving      
     surfaces free of paint, corrosion products, dirt, and other contaminants.  
                                                                                
(23) Following blasting with organic blast media, surface peak-to-valley        
     profile must be checked.  If profile of 2 to 3 mils is not attained,       
     profile must be established using aluminum oxide or garnet grit.           
                                                                                
(24) Blasting with glass beads in accordance with MIL-G-9954 is permitted for   
     shop use in surface preparation of previously painted aluminum structures  
     and non-ferrous valve bodies.  Blasting shall obtain the minimum required  
     surface profile for the paint system being applied.                        
                                                                                
                                                                                
(25) Power impact tool cleaning using power-driven needle guns, chipping or     
     scaling hammers, rotary scalers, single or multiple-piston scalers, or     
     other similar impact cleaning tools shall not be utilized in the cleaning  
     methods.                                                                   
                                  ATTACHMENT A                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
1.   MIL-P-24441 polyamide epoxy paints do not require thinning prior to        
      application.  If desired, the low temperature application properties can  
     be improved by the addition of 10 percent by volume of one-to-one mixture  
     of butyl alcohol and high flash naphtha or paint thinner TT-P-291.  When   
     sprayed without thinning at the recommended thickness, the paints have no  
     tendency to sag.  Apply a thinned mist coat of one to two mils wet film    
     thickness over existing paint.                                             
                                                                                
2.   When MIL-P-24441 polyamide epoxy paints are used at a work site having     
     temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, it is essential that the         
     stand-in period be accomplished in a warm area (70 degrees Fahrenheit) to  
     ensure that the coating will cure.                                         
                                                                                
3.   Exterior side shell and underwater body painting at surface temperatures   
     between 25 degrees Fahrenheit and 35 degrees Fahrenheit is not             
     recommended, but can be approved by the SUPERVISOR provided the following  
     conditions are met:                                                        
                                                                                
     a.  Ambient temperature must be a minimum of 5 degrees Fahrenheit above    
         the dew point.                                                         
                                                                                
     b.  Hull surfaces must be absolutely dry and free of any signs of frost    
         and ice.                                                               
                                                                                
     c.  Drying time will be increased by four hours for a total of eight       
         hours drying time per coat.                                            
                                                                                
     d.  No painting is allowed below surface temperature of 25 degrees         
         Fahrenheit.                                                            
                                                                                
     e.  Paint shall be stored at 70 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours before     
          use.                                                                  
                                                                                
4.   Painting shall not be accomplished unless surface is dry and surface       
     temperature is at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit above the dew point.          
                                                                                
5.   Approximate temperature of paint components in storage should be           
      estimated in order to judge the amount of stand-in time to allow and the  
     pot life that might be expected.  The work site application temperature    
     will greatly affect the time required for the paint to cure, and must be   
     considered in estimating batch size, stand-in time, and cure time.         
                                                                                
                                                                                
6.   Paints should be sprayed using standard spray guns with applicable         
     spray-pot pressures.  The spray guns should be equipped with a             
     middle-size (D) needle, nipple, and nozzle set-up.  Both conventional and  
     airless equipment are suitable for use with these paints.                  
                                                                                
                                  ATTACHMENT A                                  
                                   (Continued)                                  
                                                                                
7.   Catalyzed paints should not be allowed to stand in the spray equipment     
      for extended periods, especially in the sun (increasing temperature cures 
     the paint more rapidly).  The pot life of the paint mixture (Components A  
     and B) is six hours at 73 degrees Fahrenheit.                              
                                                                                
8.   Total dry film thickness specified in Table 4 for potable water tanks      
     shall not be exceeded except in isolated areas adjacent to shapes and      
     stiffeners.  In no case shall the maximum dry film thickness be exceeded   
     by two mils.  The isolated areas shall be less than two percent of the     
     total area.                                                                
                                                                                
     a.  For touch-up or overcoating intact aged paint in good condition, the   
         same requirements for each coat apply, and the total film thickness    
         maximum requirement may be corrected to allow for thickness of         
         underlying aged paint.  Requirement is to avoid excess thickness in    
         individual coats.  High dry film thicknesses resulting from the        
         application of extra coats of paint is not considered to be a problem  
         below 35 mils total dry film thickness.                                
                                                                                
9.   Formula 124, DOD-E-24607 tinted with DOD-C-22325 may be used when none     
       of the approved colors are available.  However, this should be a last    
     resort.                                                                    
                                                                                
10.  Apply heat-resistant paint (TT-P-28) to surfaces, whether insulated or     
     not, where operating temperature is over 400 degrees Fahrenheit.           
     Heat-resisting paint should also be applied to normally uninsulated hot    
     metal surfaces such as boiler drum gages and pressure gage piping.  Heat   
     resisting paint is highly flammable during application and should not be   
     applied where surface operating temperatures exceed 85 degrees             
     Fahrenheit.   Proper application is two thin coats on well-prepared, dry   
     metal surfaces.                                                            
                                                                                
11.  Avoid excessive power wire brushing that results in a polished surface.    
                                                                                
12.  Epoxy primers applied in the vicinity of abrasive blasting must be         
     sheltered from airborne contaminants.  Abrasive particles trapped in wet   
     paint films are a source of premature blistering and film failure.         
                                                                                
13.  Apply three coats of a vapor barrier coating compound, MIL-C-19565, to     
     insulation within laundries, sculleries, galleys, drying rooms, and to     
     insulation on the warm side of refrigerated stores spaces, and two coats   
     same as bulkheads and overheads, Table 3, Column D.

         4.2.3  In cases in which hot material from hot work may involve more   
than one level, as in trunks and machinery spaces, a fire watch will be         
stationed at each level unless positive means are available to prevent the      
spread or fall of hot material.                                                 
                                                                                
         4.2.4  In cases where hot work is to be performed on a bulkhead or     
deck, combustible material will be removed from the vicinity of the hot work    
on the opposite side of the bulkhead, overhead, or deck and a fire watch will   
be posted at each location.                                                     
                                                                                
                4.2.4.1  If multiple blind compartments are involved in any     
hot work job, fire watches will be posted simultaneously in each blind area.

that it is driven solidly home and to make room for additional caulking.        
                                                                                
                3.10.2.1 Set the existing caulking by driving the caulking      
uniformly, to the same hardness in each seam.  To prevent a wedging effect it   
shall be set to a hardness that would not allow an awl to penetrate more than   
3/8-inch.                                                                       
                                                                                
CHECK POINT  (Caulking Installation)                                            
                                                                                
         3.10.3 Caulking seams shall be clean and dry before installing new     
caulking and caulking compound.                                                 
                                                                                
         3.10.4 Caulk deck planking caulking seams using treated caulking       
cotton and spun-type marine oakum conforming to T-O-56.  Treat the caulking     
cotton as follows.                                                              
                                                                                
                3.10.4.1 The untreated caulking cotton shall be undyed, of not  
less than 3/4-inch staple length, and shall be free from oil, fire-damaged or   
scorched cotton, added waste, and substantially free from linters.              
                                                                                
                3.10.4.2 The untreated caulking cotton shall be soft and fully  
opened and contain no sizing.  The amount or size of specks shall not be        
objectionally noticeable upon casual examination.                               
                                                                                
                3.10.4.3 The untreated caulking cotton shall be well carded to  
form a sliver and shall consist of not less than nine nor more than 12 slivers  
laid parallel to form a composite untwisted strand.  Each sliver untreated      
shall measure approximately 500, plus or minus 50 feet, to the pound.           
                                                                                
                3.10.4.4 Treat the caulking cotton with a solvent solution of   
copper naphthenate-asphaltum to produce caulking cotton having a minimum of     
one percent metallic copper and 1-1/2 percent, plus or minus 1/2 percent,       
asphalt, based on the weight of the treated cotton.  The copper shall be        
uniformly distributed throughout the cotton.                                    
                                                                                
                3.10.4.5 The treated caulking cotton shall be dry to the touch  
prior to installation.                                                          
                                                                                
         3.10.5 Caulk hull shell planking caulking seams using treated          
caulking cotton conforming to the requirements outlined in 3.10.4.1 through     
3.10.4.5 and spun-type marine oakum conforming to T-0-56.                       
                                                                                
                3.10.5.1 Drive one to two strands of caulking cotton into the   
bottom of the seams, prior to installing marine oakum, to ensure that           
deep/tight seams are filled.                                                    
                                                                                
         3.10.6 Caulking cotton and marine oakum caulking shall be looped,      
tucked, and hard-driven to a depth that provides space for installation of      
seam caulking compound.                                                         
                                                                                
                3.10.6.1 The size of the seam in width and depth determines     
the required amount of cotton/oakum caulking and shall be filled to within      
1/4-inch to 3/8-inch of the plank surface.                                      
                                                                                
                3.10.6.2 The amount of cotton/oakum caulking inserted shall be  
carefully controlled to limit the possibility to "caulk off" a plank from its   
frames if too much is driven in and forced beyond the outgage bevel.            
                                                                                
                3.10.6.3 The cotton/oakum caulking shall be driven uniformly,   
to the same hardness and depth in each seam, to prevent a wedging effect.  It   
shall be set to a hardness that would not allow an awl to penetrate more than   
3/8-inch.                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.10.6.4 Butt caulking seams shall be caulked ahead of          
adjoining longitudinal caulking seams to ensure that short ends of caulking     
will be locked in place.                                                        
                                                                                
                3.10.6.5 The ends of sound existing caulking and new caulking   
shall be drawn out and tapered so as to be married in a continuous bulk and     
then be installed as stated in 3.10.6 through 3.10.6.4.                         
                                                                                
                3.10.6.6 Caulking irons shall conform to GGG-I-671.             
                                                                                
                3.10.6.7 Hull shell planking caulking seams of heavy planked    
ships (e.g., MSOs) shall have the caulking set firmly home by means of a heavy  
horsing iron driven into the seams with a heavy mallet known as a beetle.       
This is a two-man operation that requires one man to hold the long-handled      
horsing iron while the second man swings the horsing beetle.  This operation    
ensures that the caulking will be well seated, will not work loose, and is the  
final means to stiffen the hull.                                                
                                                                                
         3.10.7 Pay (fill) deck planking caulking seams with polyurethane       
caulking compound conforming to MIL-S-24340, Type I, Class 2, or marine glue    
MIL-G-413, Class 2, as specified in the invoking Work Item.                     
                                                                                
                3.10.7.1 The depth of the seam caulking compound shall be one   
to 1-1/2 times the width of the seam but no deeper than 3/8-inch.               
                                                                                
                3.10.7.2 Seal the surfaces of the seams and the installed       
cotton caulking with a seam primer that is compatible with the caulking         
compound.                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.10.7.3 Install one-inch wide masking tape on both sides of    
each caulking seam to keep the caulking compound from penetrating the open      
grain areas of the deck planking.                                               
                                                                                
                3.10.7.4 Remove the tape installed in 3.10.7.3 upon completion  
of caulking operations.

in accordance with the following requirements.                                  
                                                                                
                3.10.8.1 Pay underwater hull caulking seams with Interlux 30    
brown underwater seam compound (oleoresinous material cut with an aromatic      
solvent).                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.10.8.2 Pay hull caulking seams above the waterline with       
Interlux 31 white seam compound (oleoresinous material cut with an aromatic     
solvent).                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.10.8.3 The depth of the seam caulking compound shall be one   
to 1-1/2 times the width of the seam.                                           
                                                                                
                3.10.8.4 Paint the surfaces of the seams and the installed      
cotton/oakum caulking with anti-fouling paint conforming to Formula 121 of      
MIL-P-15931 prior to filling underwater hull shell planking seams with          
caulking compound.                                                              
                                                                                
                3.10.8.5 Seal the surfaces of the seams and the installed       
cotton/oakum caulking with a seam primer that is compatible with the caulking   
compound on hull shell planking seams existing above the waterline.             
                                                                                
         3.10.9 Prior to paying the caulking compound installed in 3.10.7 and

                3.10.9.1 The caulking compound may be applied with a caulking   
gun but shall be handworked into the seams to eliminate air pockets and voids   
in the seams.                                                                   
                                                                                
                3.10.9.2 Remove surplus caulking compound from surrounding      
surfaces.                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.10.9.3 Pay and complete seams daily, leaving no exposed       
cotton/oakum caulking at the end of each work shift to ensure the cotton/oakum  
caulking remains dry and clean.

         3.3.1  Contractor shall coordinate the correction of discrepancies as  
they are discovered at the direction of the SUPERVISOR.                         
                                                                                
         3.3.2  The quick response team members shall have with them (or        
readily accessible), the tools of their trade for immediate use in the          
correction of discrepancies.                                                    
                                                                                
4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  The LOE is a comprehensive examination of the ship in the key areas    
of:  The level of knowledge and state of training of propulsion plant           
personnel; the adequacy of Engineering Department administrative programs and   
procedures; the material readiness of the propulsion plant; and the state of    
cleanliness and preservation of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery         
spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by the Propulsion Examining Board (PEB)   
or the Type Commander Staff.  The examination will be conducted immediately     
prior to scheduled boiler light-off and it must be concluded successfully       
prior to boiler light-off.  The material portion examination usually takes      
less than 12 hours.  If restrictive discrepancies are identified, those         
discrepancies must be corrected prior to boiler light-off.                      
                                                                                
    4.2  The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team and accomplish a      
preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with Ship's Force eight to four       
weeks prior to the LOE to determine and record discrepancies which would        
impact upon the LOE.  The pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will  
result in the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work considered    
necessary to support a successful Light-Off Examination.  Each discrepancy      
noted in the inspection will be described in simple terms on a four part,       
serialized form.   The form will identify the general location of the           
discrepancy and the associated Work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth     
copy of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be hung by    
the SUPERVISOR's inspection team in the immediate proximity of the discrepancy  
(on the deficient item itself, when practical).  Upon completion of the         
Pre-LOE the SUPERVISOR will identify contractor responsible discrepancies to    
the contractor.  Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the  
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's Force.  That       
portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by the Ship's Force will be    
considered for accomplishment by the contractor.                                
                                                                                
         4.2.1  Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection that        
additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be similarly identified and  
screened.

preliminary LOE discrepancies.  Notify the SUPERVISOR immediately upon          
determination of any discrepancies that cannot be corrected prior to the        
scheduled LOE, giving the reason and expected completion date.

         3.3.1  Contractor shall coordinate the correction of discrepancies as  
they are discovered at the direction of the SUPERVISOR.                         
                                                                                
         3.3.2  The quick response team members shall have with them (or        
readily accessible), the tools of their trade for immediate use in the          
correction of discrepancies.                                                    
                                                                                
4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  The LOE is a comprehensive examination of the ship in the key areas    
of:  The level of knowledge and state of training of propulsion plant           
personnel; the adequacy of Engineering Department administrative programs and   
procedures; the material readiness of the propulsion plant; and the state of    
cleanliness and preservation of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery         
spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by the Propulsion Examining Board (PEB)   
or the Type Commander Staff.  The examination will be conducted immediately     
prior to scheduled gas turbine  engine light-off and it must be concluded       
successfully prior to gas turbine engine light-off.  The material portion       
examination usually takes less than 12 hours.  If restrictive discrepancies     
are identified, those discrepancies must be corrected prior to gas turbine      
light-off.                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.2  The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team, and accomplish a     
preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with Ship's Force eight to four       
weeks prior to the LOE to determine and record discrepancies which would        
impact upon the LOE.  The pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will  
result in the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work considered    
necessary to support a successful Light-Off Examination.  Each discrepancy      
noted in the inspection will be described in simple terms on a four part,       
serialized form.  The form will identify the general location of the            
discrepancy and the associated Work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth     
copy of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be hung by    
the SUPERVISOR's inspection team in the immediate proximity of the discrepancy  
(on the deficient item itself, when practical).  Upon completion of the         
Pre-LOE the SUPERVISOR will identify contractor responsible discrepancies to    
the contractor.  Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the  
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's Force.  That       
portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by the Ship's Force will be    
considered for accomplishment by the contractor.                                
                                                                                
         4.2.1  Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection that        
additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be similarly identified and  
screened.

milliliters (2/3 gallon) of catalyzed 15-percent hydrazine and 375 milliliters  
(4/5 pint) of 40-percent morpholine shall be used.                              
                                                                                
                3.3.4.1  Transfer the required amount of hydrazine into narrow  
mouthed one-gallon or two-gallon polyethylene bottles with polyethylene or      
polypropylene screw closures.                                                   
                                                                                
                3.3.4.2  Transfer the required amount of morpholine to a        
narrow mouthed pint, quart, or gallon polyethylene bottle as appropriate to     
the volume needed.  Pour the morpholine and hydrazine into the tank.            
                                                                                
                3.3.4.3  Immediately fill the tank with feedwater to the        
  level calculated in 3.3 for the quantity of hydrazine solution desired.       
                                                                                
         3.3.5  Remove water from the boiler, superheater, and economizer.      
 Close boiler drains and openings with the exception of steam drum,             
superheater, and economizer vents.                                              
                                                                                
         3.3.6  Immediately fill the boiler, including superheater and          
economizer, taking suction from the hydrazine/morpholine-treated tank.          
                                                                                
                3.3.6.1  While filling the boiler, close each vent in turn as   
the treated water overflows.  After the boiler is filled as shown by an         
overflow from the highest vent, crack each lower vent in turn to ensure that    
there are no trapped air pockets.                                               
                                                                                
    3.4  Maintain a minimum of 15 PSIG, not to exceed 150 PSIG, hydrostatic     
pressure on the boiler, using a head tank, nitrogen, or shore steam in          
accordance with Appendix B and Paragraph 221-2.3 of 2.a.                        
                                                                                
    3.5  Determine the hydrazine concentration and pH on the day the boiler is  
placed under lay-up and weekly thereafter.  PH test shall be accomplished       
using a pH meter.                                                               
                                                                                
         3.5.1  Draw a sample through the boiler water sample line after        
allowing the boiler water to flow for five minutes to flush the line.  Allow    
the sample bottle to overflow before capping the bottle to eliminate trapped    
air.                                                                            
                                                                                
                3.5.1.1  Determine the hydrazine concentration and Ph as soon   
as possible, but within one hour after sampling.                                
                                                                                
                3.5.1.2  The hydrazine concentration will normally be between   
30 and 70 ppm.  If the hydrazine content falls below 10 ppm, notify the         
SUPERVISOR.  The pH value will normally be between 8.5 and 9.5.  Do not         
retreat if the pH falls outside this range.                                     
                                                                                
         3.5.2  Submit four legible copies of a report to the SUPERVISOR of     
the hydrazine concentration and pH on the day the lay-up commences and weekly   
thereafter.                                                                     
                                                                                
    3.6  Drain the superheater and bring the boilers to operating level.        
Dispose of removed solution in accordance with local, state, and Federal        
regulations.

    a.   S6226-JX-MMA-010, Instruction Manual for the Indicator Reverse Method  
         of Pump Shaft Alignment                                                
                                                                                
3.  REQUIREMENTS:                                                               
                                                                                
    3.1  Measure pump and driver shaft's alignment using the indicator reverse  
 method in accordance with 2.a.  Dial indicator rim readings shall be taken     
 radially on both the driver and pump shafts for the purpose of calculating the 
 relative positions of the shafts.                                              
                                                                                
    3.2  Repair soft foot and determine indicator sag prior to the alignment    
check.                                                                          
                                                                                
         3.2.1  Measure soft foot by alternately loosening and tightening each  
hold-down bolt on the machine to be shimmed one at a time and measure the       
vertical movement of each of the machine's feet, using a dial indicator or      
feeler gage.  Repair soft foot by installing shims in the short leg of the      
machine and eliminate vertical movement greater than 0.004-inch.                
                                                                                
         3.2.2  Measure sag by mounting the indicators and brackets that are    
to be used for the alignment on a straight piece of pipe or rod in exactly the  
same mounting setup that will be used on the pump.  Set the pipe so that the    
indicator is at dead center top, set the indicator at zero, rotate the pipe to  
dead center bottom, and record the dial indicator reading; this is the sag      
reading that must be compensated for in performing vertical alignments.  Set    
sag as a positive (+) number on the indicator.  Check both indicators.          
                                                                                
    3.3  Inspect piping alignment in accordance with section 2-3 of 2.a prior   
to alignment check.                                                             
                                                                                
         3.3.1  Submit four legible copies of a report listing results of the   
 piping alignment checks to the SUPERVISOR within 24 hours of completion of the 
inspection.                                                                     
                                                                                
    3.4  Measure alignment with the coupling assembled and rotate the shafts    
together.  Mount the two indicators so that one indicator is bracketed to the   
pump shaft and set to read off of the driver shaft; mount the other indicator   
180 degrees from the first indicator bracketed on the driver shaft and set to   
read off of the pump shaft.  For purposes of alignment, any device that is      
locked to the shaft is considered an extension of the shaft and may be used as  
an anchor point for the dial indicator and indicator bracket.                   
                                                                                
         3.4.1  Measure alignments in two planes, horizontal and vertical, and  
express as two components:  Angularity and offset.                              
                                                                                
                3.4.1.1  The angular component is the angle that is formed      
between the shaft centerline of the pump and driver shafts.  This angle is      
expressed as a slope of the angle in thousandths of an inch per inch.           
Determine angularity in both the vertical and horizontal planes, and express    
as Vertical Angularity and Horizontal Angularity.                               
                                                                                
                3.4.1.2  The offset component is the radial distance between    
the two shafts when measured at the centerline of the coupling.  The distance   
is expressed in thousandths of an inch.  Determine offset in both the vertical  
and horizontal planes and express as Vertical Offset and Horizontal Offset.     
                                                                                
    3.5  Accomplish indicator readings in accordance with 2.a.  Set the         
indicator on the machine to be shimmed (MTBS) side in the vertical direction,   
in the 12 o'clock position of the shaft, dial in the indicator sag value of     
3.2.2.2, rotate the shaft 180 degrees until the indicator is at the 6 o'clock   
position, and record this indicator reading as MB. Perform the same on the      
stationary machine side; set sag value with the indicator in the 12 o'clock     
position, rotate indicator to the 6 o'clock position, and record indicator      
reading as SB.  Set the indicator on the MTBS side in the horizontal            
direction, at the 3 o'clock position (clock set by looking from the MTBS),      
dial the indicator to zero, rotate the shaft to the 9 o'clock position, and     
record the indicator reading as ML.  Accomplish the same on the stationary      
side; set the indicator at zero when it is set at the 3 o'clock position,       
rotate the shaft 180 degrees to the 9 o'clock position, and record the          
indicator reading as SL.  Accomplish readings a minimum of three times to       
ensure repeatability.                                                           
                                                                                
         3.5.1  Determine shaft alignment using mathematical equations or       
graphs or alignment computer in accordance with 2.a.                            
                                                                                
                3.5.1.1  Use the following mathematical equations in            
accordance with 2.a:                                                            
                                                                                
         Vertical Angularity     ANGV   =   (MB +   SB) / (2 x A)

preliminary LOE discrepancies.  Notify the SUPERVISOR immediately upon          
determination of any discrepancies that cannot be corrected prior to the        
scheduled LOE, giving the reason and expected completion date.                  
                                                                                
    3.3  Provide the services of a contractor quick response team during the    
LOE to correct Government and contractor discrepancies.

4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  The LOE is a comprehensive examination of the ship in the key areas    
of:  The level of knowledge and fire fighting capability of propulsion plant    
personnel; the adequacy of Engineering Department administrative programs and   
procedures; the material readiness of the propulsion plant; and the state of    
cleanliness and preservation of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery         
spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by the Propulsion Examining Board (PEB)   
or the Type Commander Staff.  The examination will be conducted immediately     
prior to scheduled diesel engine light-off and it must be concluded             
successfully prior to diesel engine light-off.  The material portion            
examination usually takes less than 12 hours.  If restrictive discrepancies     
are identified, those discrepancies must be corrected prior to diesel engine    
light-off.                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.2  The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team and accomplish a      
preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with Ship's Force eight to four       
weeks prior to the LOE to determine and record discrepancies which would        
impact upon the LOE.  The pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will  
result in the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work considered    
necessary to support a successful Light-Off Examination.  Each discrepancy      
noted in the inspection will be described in simple terms on a four-part,       
serialized form.  The form will identify the general location of the            
discrepancy and the associated work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth     
copy of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be hung by    
the SUPERVISOR'S inspection team in the immediate proximity of the discrepancy  
(on the deficient item itself, when practical).  Upon completion of the         
Pre-LOE the Supervisor will identify contractor responsible discrepancies to    
the contractor.  Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the  
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's Force.  That       
portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by the Ship's Force will be    
considered for accomplishment by the contractor.                                
                                                                                
         4.2.1  Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection that        
additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be similarly identified and  
screened.

    3.5  Locate oxygen, acetylene, or gas supply manifold systems off the       
craft.  Manifolds connected to pierside supply systems may be placed on board   
ships as long as they are equipped with a shutoff valve located on the pier.    
                                                                                
         3.5.1  The pierside shutoff valve shall be in addition to the shutoff  
valve at the inlet to each portable outlet header required by 2.b.              
                                                                                
         3.5.2  When gas cylinders are required on board craft, they shall be   
located on the weather decks.  The number of in-use cylinders shall be limited  
to those which are required for work in progress and which have pressure        
regulators connected to the cylinder valves.  Onboard reserve gas cylinders     
shall not exceed one-half the number of in-use cylinders and shall be located   
in a remote area of the weather decks.                                          
                                                                                
         3.5.3  When not in use, gas cylinders on  board shall have valves

verbal means, followed    on the next work day, by an original                  
and two copies of a letter stating pertinent details.  Receipt of               
this notification by the SUPERVISOR is not to  be construed as a                
waiver of the requirements, delivery schedule by the  Government,               
or waiver of rights or remedies provided by law or under this Job               
Order or any other requirements in the Job Order relating to                    
jeopardy of  contract schedule dates.

work or material procurement that is necessary in order to                      
produce a reliable or complete repair.  The goal is to have                     
required work completed within the original contract period.

that could result in a change in work to be accomplished or                     
additional material to be procured, complete the preliminary work               
and submit the required report in a time frame to allow the                     
SUPERVISOR to initiate early action.                                            
                                                                                
       3.2.2        When a Work Item does not require a report for              
additional work or material procurement, and an additional report               
is determined to be necessary, submit a report with supporting                  
data as early as possible in the contract period.

             3.2.3.2      A description of the conditions found with            
supporting data.  Include annotated sketches, graphs, and                       
photographs when necessary to make a report clearly                             
understandable to the SUPERVISOR.  Identify actual

       3.3.1        Complete work which requires tests in time to allow         
correction of deficiencies prior to dock trials, sea trials, or                 
other applicable milestones established in the Job Order.                       
                                                                                
       3.3.2        Do not operate newly installed or repaired                  
equipment.  Ship's Force will accomplish such operation when                    
required for test and checkout purposes.  Such requirements will                
be coordinated by the SUPERVISOR.

Agreement for Repair and Alteration of Vessel Number        ", is               
to be included on the form.

the office of the SUPERVISOR.                                                   
                                                                                
       3.6.3        Work Items will normally reference the basic                
Government Specifications, Standards, or NAVSEA Standard Plans,                 
without prefix zeros or suffix letters or numbers which identify                
revisions or amendments.  Unless otherwise specified, the                       
effective issue of these basic referenced documents,  including                 
revisions or amendments, shall be the most recent issue at the                  
date of solicitation for a Job Order.  Wherever specific dates                  
for specifications, standards, and publications or amendments,                  
revisions, or alterations thereto are specified in the Work                     
Items, issues of those dates specifically shall apply in lieu of                
any other issue.  Where industry standards such as ASTM and ANSI                
are referenced, the issue or revision in effect on the date                     
specified for Government publication applies.                                   
                                                                                
   3.7    Submit requests for deviations to the SUPERVISOR.                     
                                                                                
       3.7.1        A deviation is defined as any action which is not in        
conformance with the Work Item requirements, including references               
thereto, no matter how minor.                                                   
                                                                                
       3.7.2        Deviations from Work Items and references thereto           
will not be considered by the SUPERVISOR without a written                      
request from the contractor.                                                    
                                                                                
       3.7.3        An original and three copies of requests for                
deviations shall be forwarded to the SUPERVISOR.                                
                                                                                
       3.7.4        The Government does not have an obligation to               
approve any deviation; it may elect to do so if benefit to the                  
Government can be shown. Accomplish deviation only when

       3.8.1        Noncompliance/nonconformance with the requirements          
of the Job Order discovered by the Government will be reported to               
the contractor in writing.                                                      
                                                                                
       3.8.2        Respond in writing to the report, indicating

operations will be accomplished.  Ensure that equipment and                     
machinery have not been infiltrated by contaminants.  If                        
contamination or surface damage has occurred, notify the                        
SUPERVISOR immediately, and in writing, and reseal to prevent                   
further entry of contaminants or surface damage.                                
                                                                                
   3.3    Remove protective material upon completion of                         
contamination-producing operations and inspect for presence of                  
contamination or surface damage.  Notify the SUPERVISOR                         
immediately, and in writing, if contamination or surface damage                 
has occurred, prior to removal of the contamination and repair of               
damage.                                                                         
                                                                                
       3.3.1        Dispose of discarded protective material in                 
accordance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or

4.     NOTES:                                                                   
                                                                                
   4.1    The SUPERVISOR will coordinate operation of ventilation               
systems, as requested by the contractor, to maintain a positive                 
pressure within the vessel's envelope and to create an outward                  
flow of air through crevices or around penetrations.

of the component to be balanced is less than 150 revolutions per                
minute (RPM), the rotor including shaft shall be balanced by                    
symmetrically supporting the rotor on two knife edges and                       
applying a correction to attain a gravity balance.

             3.2.3.2      The allowable unbalance criteria for a propeller      
shall be that specified on the applicable propeller drawing.  If                
not specified in the drawing, the allowable unbalance shall be

4.     NOTES:                                                                   
                                                                                
   4.1    The magnetic field of mine warfare ships and craft                    
consists of the superposition of the magnetic field from four                   
basic sources:  ferrous field, eddy current field, ship service                 
stray field, and minesweep generator stray field.  The stray                    
field sources are the electric currents in cables and wiring                    
associated with the operation of the equipment of the ship or                   
craft.  The ferrous field and eddy current field sources are as                 
follows:                                                                        
                                                                                
       4.1.1        Ferrous Field Source:  The ferrous field sources are        
the items on or part of the ship or craft which use a material in               
their construction that exhibits a relative magnetic permeability               
different than 1.0, the relative magnetic permeability of air.                  
Each ferrous field source acts like a bar magnet whose magnetic                 
field depends upon the material's relative magnetic permeability,               
volume (not mass), and shape of the earth's magnetic field.  At a               
point or location external to a ferrous field source, the                       
magnetic field of this source is essentially the same whether the               
source is hollow (such as a block or pedestal).  A material whose               
relative magnetic permeability is 2.0 or less is arbitrarily                    
defined to be nonmagnetic when used in conjunction with mine                    
warfare ships and craft; otherwise, the material is said to be                  
magnetic.  Whether the material of an item is classified magnetic               
or nonmagnetic, according to the above arbitrary definition, a                  
change in relative magnetic permeability of the material will, in               
general, result in a change in the magnetic field associated with               
this item.                                                                      
                                                                                
       4.1.2        Eddy Current Field Source:  The eddy current field          
sources are the items on or part of the ship or craft which use a               
material in their construction that exhibits an electrical                      
conductivity.  A material whose electrical conductivity is less                 
than 0.5 percent of the electrical conductivity of copper (1.7241               
x 10-6 ohm-cm at 20 degrees Centigrade) is arbitrarily defined to               
be nonconductive when used in conjunction with mine warfare ships               
and craft; otherwise, the material is said to be electrically                   
conductive.  Each eddy current field source acts like a generator               
when it oscillates in the earth's magnetic field due to the                     
rolling and pitching of the ship or craft.  The current in this                 
source, resulting from the generator action, has associated with                
it a magnetic field - an eddy current field.  The magnitude of                  
this field is dependent upon the conductivity of the material,                  
the size of the electrical path in the material, the                            
cross-sectional area of the electrical path, and the orientation                
of the source with respect to the earth's magnetic field due to                 
the rolling and pitching of the ship or craft. The current in                   
this source, resulting from the generator action, has associated                
with it a magnetic field - an eddy current field.  The magnitude                
of this field is dependent upon the conductivity of the material,               
the size of the electrical path in the material, the                            
cross-sectional area of the electrical path, and the orientation                
of the source with respect to the earth's magnetic field.                       
                                                                                
       4.1.3        If an item is both highly magnetic and electrically         
conductive, such as mild steel or steel, the ferrous field will                 
mask out the eddy current field.  If an electrically conductive                 
item is located inside a highly magnetic enclosure, such as mild                
steel or steel, the enclosure will mask the magnetic effects of                 
its contents and will appear as if it were a solid magnetic                     
block.                                                                          
                                                                                
   4.2    The SUPERVISOR will provide written direction for                     
accomplishment of one of the following prior to installation of                 
existing or new material/equipment as a result of the deviation

       3.12.1       The MIL-P-24441 coatings mixing ratio is one-to-one         
by volume. The components of the various formulas are not                       
interchangeable.                                                                
                                                                                
       3.12.2       Blend each component thoroughly prior to mixing the         
components.  After mixing equal volumes of the two components,                  
the mixture must be thoroughly stirred, and the stand-in times                  
listed below must be observed.                                                  
                                                                                
             3.12.2.1     Stand-in time (induction time) is defined as the      
time immediately following the mixing of the components A and B                 
during which the critical reaction period of these components is                
initiated and is essential to the complete curing of the coating.               
During stand-in time the mixture must be thoroughly stirred at                  
least once every 20 minutes to avoid hot spots caused by                        
localized overheating from the chemical reaction.

       3.12.3       Apply the first coat of MIL-P-15931 (Formulas               
121/129) or MIL-P-24647 anti-fouling paint when the last coat of                
epoxy paint is still slightly tacky (approximately four to six                  
hours after paint application).  If the epoxy is hard (usually                  
eight hours after application), apply a tack coat of epoxy paint                
one to two mils WFT over previously painted surfaces.  Allow to                 
dry four hours and apply the anti-fouling paint.  Above also                    
applies to application of any non-epoxy system over an epoxy                    
coating.                                                                        
                                                                                
             3.12.3.1     Tacky is defined as that curing (drying) stage when   
a fingertip pressed lightly against the film leaves only a slight               
impression and none of the film sticks to the finger.                           
                                                                                
             3.12.3.2     If more than seven days elapse between preservation   
coatings of epoxy, the surfaces shall be cleaned with fresh water               
and detergent and rinsed with fresh water.  Lightly sand                        
(scarify) the surface and wipe with a solvent.  Apply a tack                    
coat, one to two mils WFT, of the last coat applied within four                 
hours prior to applying the next full coat of the system.

(19)MIL-C-24667, MIL-D-23003, and MIL-D-24483 non-skid systems                  
    shall be applied as complete systems (primer, intermediate                  
    coat when MIL-C-24667 Type III coatings are invoked,                        
    non-skid, and color topping) from the same manufacturer                     
    except for the color topping.  When a manufacturer does not                 
    have approved color topping, use another compatible                         
    manufacturer color topping.  MIL-C-24667, Type I, when                      
    required, shall be specified in the invoking Work Item.  MIL-               
    D-23003 Qualified Product List now only specifies a flexible                
    non-skid coating.                                                           
                                                                                
(20)Prior to accomplishing painting of wooden underwater hulls,                 
    allow the    hull to dry to a moisture content of 15                        
    percent.  Readings shall be     | taken with an electronic                  
    moisture meter, Sovereigh Moisture Master or    equal.                      
    Cover grounding plates and zincs prior to painting.                         
                                                                                
(21)Blasted surface metal must be degreased following walnut                    
    shell blasting. Even traces of residual oil will degrade                    
    coating adhesion.  Optimum method is to wipe down the                       
    blasted surface with a 1:1 solvent mixture by volume of                     
    methyl ethyl ketone and mineral spirits.  Appropriate safety                
    precautions for working with flammable solvents must be

1.  MIL-P-24441 polyamide epoxy paints do not require thinning                  
    prior to  application.  If desired, the low temperature                     
    application properties can be improved by the addition of 10                
    percent by volume of one-to-one mixture of butyl alcohol and                
    high flash naphtha or paint thinner TT-P-291.  When sprayed                 
    without thinning at the recommended thickness, the paints                   
    have no tendency to sag.  Apply a thinned mist coat of one                  
    to two mils wet film thickness over existing paint.                         
                                                                                
2.  When MIL-P-24441 polyamide epoxy paints are used at a work                  
    site having temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, it is                 
    essential that the stand-in period be accomplished in a warm                
    area (70 degrees Fahrenheit) to ensure that the coating will                
    cure.                                                                       
                                                                                
3.  Exterior side shell and underwater body painting at surface                 
    temperatures between 25 degrees Fahrenheit and 35 degrees                   
    Fahrenheit is not recommended, but can be approved by the                   
    SUPERVISOR provided the following conditions are met:                       
                                                                                
       a.   Ambient temperature must be a minimum of 5 degrees                  
       Fahrenheit above the dew point.                                          
                                                                                
       b.   Hull surfaces must be absolutely dry and free of any                
       signs of frost and ice.                                                  
                                                                                
       c.   Drying time will be increased by four hours for a                   
       total of eight hours drying time per coat.                               
                                                                                
       d.   No painting is allowed below surface temperature of                 
       25 degrees Fahrenheit.                                                   
                                                                                
       e.   Paint shall be stored at 70 degrees Fahrenheit for                  
       24 hours before  use.                                                    
                                                                                
4.  Painting shall not be accomplished unless surface is dry and                
    surface temperature is at least 5 degrees Fahrenheit above                  
    the dew point.                                                              
                                                                                
5.  Approximate temperature of paint components in storage                      
    should be  estimated in order to judge the amount of                        
    stand-in time to allow and the pot life that might be                       
    expected.  The work site application temperature will                       
    greatly affect the time required for the paint to cure, and                 
    must be considered in estimating batch size, stand-in time,                 
    and cure time.                                                              
                                                                                
6.  Paints should be sprayed using standard spray guns with                     
    applicable spray-pot pressures.  The spray guns should be                   
    equipped with a middle-size (D) needle, nipple, and nozzle                  
    set-up.  Both conventional and airless equipment are                        
    suitable for use with these paints.                                         
                                                                                
7.  Catalyzed paints should not be allowed to stand in the spray                
    equipment  for extended periods, especially in the sun                      
    (increasing temperature cures the paint more rapidly).  The                 
    pot life of the paint mixture (Components A and B) is six                   
    hours at 73 degrees Fahrenheit.                                             
                                                                                
8.  Total dry film thickness specified in Table 4 for potable                   
    water tanks shall not be exceeded except in isolated areas                  
    adjacent to shapes and stiffeners.  In no case shall the                    
    maximum dry film thickness be exceeded by two mils.  The                    
    isolated areas shall be less than two percent of the total                  
    area.                                                                       
                                                                                
       a.   For touch-up or overcoating intact aged paint in                    
       good condition, the same requirements for each coat                      
       apply, and the total film thickness maximum requirement                  
       may be corrected to allow for thickness of underlying                    
       aged paint.  Requirement is to avoid excess thickness in                 
       individual coats.  High dry film thicknesses resulting                   
       from the application of extra coats of paint is not                      
       considered to be a problem below 35 mils total dry film                  
       thickness.                                                               
                                                                                
9.  Formula 124, DOD-E-24607 tinted with DOD-C-22325 may be used                
    when none   of the approved colors are available.  However,                 
    this should be a last resort.                                               
                                                                                
10. Apply heat-resistant paint (TT-P-28) to surfaces, whether                   
    insulated or not, where operating temperature is over 400                   
    degrees Fahrenheit. Heat-resisting paint should also be                     
    applied to normally uninsulated hot metal surfaces such as                  
    boiler drum gages and pressure gage piping.  Heat resisting                 
    paint is highly flammable during application and should not                 
    be applied where surface operating temperatures exceed 85                   
    degrees Fahrenheit.   Proper application is two thin coats                  
    on well-prepared, dry metal surfaces.                                       
                                                                                
11. Avoid excessive power wire brushing that results in a                       
    polished surface.                                                           
                                                                                
12. Epoxy primers applied in the vicinity of abrasive blasting                  
    must be sheltered from airborne contaminants.  Abrasive                     
    particles trapped in wet paint films are a source of                        
    premature blistering and film failure.                                      
                                                                                
13. Apply three coats of a vapor barrier coating compound,                      
    MIL-C-19565, to insulation within laundries, sculleries,                    
    galleys, drying rooms, and to insulation on the warm side of                
    refrigerated stores spaces, and two coats same as bulkheads                 
    and overheads, Table 3, Column D.
