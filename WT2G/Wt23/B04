             3.4.4.1      Apply pressure to the system.  Back off pressure by   
turning off valve supplying gases to the system.  If the pressure               
on the gage drops, a leak on the system exists.  If the pressure                
on the gage does not drop, the system is tight.

use in the correction of discrepancies.                                         
                                                                                
4.     NOTES:                                                                   
                                                                                
   4.1    The LOE is a comprehensive examination of the ship in the             
key areas of:  The level of knowledge and state of training of                  
propulsion plant personnel; the adequacy of Engineering                         
Department administrative programs and procedures; the material                 
readiness of the propulsion plant; and the state of cleanliness                 
and preservation of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery                     
spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by the Propulsion Examining               
Board (PEB) or the Type Commander Staff.  The examination will be               
conducted immediately prior to scheduled boiler light-off and it                
must be concluded successfully prior to boiler light-off.  The                  
material portion examination usually takes less than 12 hours.                  
If restrictive discrepancies are identified, those discrepancies                
must be corrected prior to boiler light-off.                                    
                                                                                
   4.2    The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team and                  
accomplish a preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with                     
Ship's Force eight to four weeks prior to the LOE to determine                  
and record discrepancies which would impact upon the LOE.  The                  
pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will result in                  
the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work                         
considered necessary to support a successful Light-Off                          
Examination.  Each discrepancy noted in the inspection will be                  
described in simple terms on a four part, serialized form.   The                
form will identify the general location of the discrepancy and                  
the associated Work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth copy                
of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be                 
hung by the SUPERVISOR's inspection team in the immediate                       
proximity of the discrepancy (on the deficient item itself, when                
practical).  Upon completion of the Pre-LOE the SUPERVISOR will                 
identify contractor responsible discrepancies to the contractor.                
Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the                   
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's                    
Force.  That portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by                
the Ship's Force will be considered for accomplishment by the                   
contractor.                                                                     
                                                                                
       4.2.1        Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection         
that additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be                      
similarly identified and screened.

   4.1    The LOE is a comprehensive examination of the ship in the             
key areas of:  The level of knowledge and state of training of                  
propulsion plant personnel; the adequacy of Engineering                         
Department administrative programs and procedures; the material                 
readiness of the propulsion plant; and the state of cleanliness                 
and preservation of main propulsion and auxiliary machinery                     
spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by the Propulsion Examining               
Board (PEB) or the Type Commander Staff.  The examination will be               
conducted immediately prior to scheduled gas turbine engine                     
light-off and it must be concluded successfully prior to gas                    
turbine engine light-off.  The material portion                                 
examination usually takes less than 12 hours.  If restrictive                   
discrepancies are identified, those discrepancies must be                       
corrected prior to gas turbine light-off.                                       
                                                                                
   4.2    The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team, and                 
accomplish a preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with                     
Ship's Force eight to four weeks prior to the LOE to determine                  
and record discrepancies which would impact upon the LOE.  The                  
pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will result in                  
the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work                         
considered necessary to support a successful Light-Off                          
Examination.  Each discrepancy noted in the inspection will be                  
described in simple terms on a four part, serialized form.  The                 
form will identify the general location of the discrepancy and                  
the associated Work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth copy                
of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be                 
hung by the SUPERVISOR's inspection team in the immediate                       
proximity of the discrepancy (on the deficient item itself, when                
practical).  Upon completion of the Pre-LOE the SUPERVISOR will                 
identify contractor responsible discrepancies to the contractor.                
Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the                   
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's                    
Force.  That portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by                
the Ship's Force will be considered for accomplishment by the                   
contractor.                                                                     
                                                                                
       4.2.1        Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection         
that additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be                      
similarly identified and screened.

   3.5    Determine the hydrazine concentration and pH on the day               
the boiler is placed under lay-up and weekly thereafter.  PH test               
shall be accomplished using a pH meter.                                         
                                                                                
       3.5.1        Draw a sample through the boiler water sample line          
after allowing the boiler water to flow for five minutes to flush               
the line.  Allow the sample bottle to overflow before capping the               
bottle to eliminate trapped air.                                                
                                                                                
             3.5.1.1      Determine the hydrazine concentration and Ph as soon  
as possible, but within one hour after sampling.                                
                                                                                
             3.5.1.2      The hydrazine concentration will normally be between  
30 and 70 ppm.  If the hydrazine content falls below 10 ppm,                    
notify the SUPERVISOR.  The pH value will normally be between 8.5               
and 9.5.  Do not retreat if the pH falls outside this range.                    
                                                                                
       3.5.2        Submit four legible copies of a report to the               
SUPERVISOR of the hydrazine concentration and pH on the day the                 
lay-up commences and weekly thereafter.                                         
                                                                                
   3.6    Drain the superheater and bring the boilers to operating              
level. Dispose of removed solution in accordance with local,                    
state, and Federal regulations.                                                 
                                                                                
       3.6.1        Do not drain the solution to the bilge.

brackets that are to be used for the alignment on a straight                    
piece of pipe or rod in exactly the same mounting setup that will               
be used on the shafts.  Set the pipe so that the indicator is at                
top dead center, set the indicator at zero, rotate the pipe to                  
bottom dead center, and record the dial indicator reading; this                 
is the sag reading that must be compensated for in performing                   
vertical plane alignments.  Set sag as a positive (+) number on                 
the indicator.

machinery spaces.  The LOE will be accomplished by the Propulsion               
Examining Board (PEB) or the Type Commander Staff.  The                         
examination will be conducted immediately prior to scheduled                    
diesel engine light-off and it must be concluded successfully                   
prior to diesel engine light-off.  The material portion                         
examination usually takes less than 12 hours.  If restrictive                   
discrepancies are identified, those discrepancies must be                       
corrected prior to diesel engine light-off.                                     
                                                                                
   4.2    The SUPERVISOR will establish an inspection team and                  
accomplish a preliminary LOE inspection in conjunction with                     
Ship's Force eight to four weeks prior to the LOE to determine                  
and record discrepancies which would impact upon the LOE.  The                  
pre-LOE will be about four days in duration and will result in                  
the identification of discrepancies and incomplete work                         
considered necessary to support a successful Light-Off                          
Examination.  Each discrepancy noted in the inspection will be                  
described in simple terms on a four-part, serialized form.  The                 
form will identify the general location of the discrepancy and                  
the associated work Item number, if applicable.  The fourth copy                
of the form, made of hard card with an attachment wire, will be                 
hung by the SUPERVISOR'S inspection team in the immediate                       
proximity of the discrepancy (on the deficient item itself, when                
practical).  Upon completion of the Pre-LOE the Supervisor will                 
identify contractor responsible discrepancies to the contractor.                
Deficient items identified that are the responsibility of the                   
Government will be screened for accomplishment by the Ship's                    
Force.  That portion of this work that cannot be accomplished by                
the Ship's Force will be considered for accomplishment by the                   
contractor.                                                                     
                                                                                
       4.2.1        Any time after completion of the pre-LOE inspection         
that additional discrepancies are discovered, they will be                      
similarly identified and screened.

       3.4.2        Where several workers are performing hot work at one        
site, the fire watch shall have a clear view of and immediate                   
access to each worker performing hot work.                                      
                                                                                
             3.4.2.1      No more than four workers shall be attended by a      
single fire watch.                                                              
                                                                                
       3.4.3        In cases in which hot material from hot work may            
involve more than one level, as in trunks and machinery spaces, a               
fire watch shall be stationed at each level unless positive means               
are available to prevent the spread or fall of hot material.                    
                                                                                
       3.4.4        In cases where hot work is to be performed on a             
bulkhead or deck, combustible material shall be removed from the                
vicinity of the hot work on the opposite side of the bulkhead,                  
overhead, or deck and a fire watch shall be posted at each                      
location.                                                                       
                                                                                
             3.4.4.1      If multiple blind compartments are involved in any    
hot work job, fire watches shall be posted simultaneously in each               
blind area.                                                                     
                                                                                
   3.5    Locate oxygen, acetylene, or gas supply manifold systems              
off the     craft.  Manifolds connected to pierside supply                      
systems may be placed on board craft as long as they are equipped               
with a shutoff valve located on the pier.                                       
       3.5.1        The pierside shutoff valve shall be in addition to          
the shutoff valve at the inlet to each portable outlet header                   
required by 2.a.                                                                
                                                                                
       3.5.2        When gas cylinders are required on board craft, they        
shall be located on the weather decks and shall be secured and in               
an upright position.  The number of in-use cylinders shall be                   
limited to those which are required for work in progress and                    
which have pressure regulators connected to the cylinder valves.                
Onboard reserve gas cylinders shall not exceed one-half the                     
number of in-use cylinders and shall be located in a remote area                
of the weather decks.                                                           
                                                                                
       3.5.3        When not in use, gas cylinders on  board shall have         
valves closed, lines disconnected, protective cover (cap) in                    
place, and shall be     secured and in an upright position.                     
                                                                                
             3.5.3.1      Overnight and at the change of shifts, the torch and  
hose shall be removed from the confined space.  Open end fuel gas               
and oxygen  hoses shall be immediately removed from confined                    
spaces when they are disconnected from the torch or other gas                   
consuming device.                                                               
                                                                                
       3.5.4        Upon completion of oxygen - fuel gas system hook-up,        
accomplish a drop test in open air to include the torch, hoses,                 
and gages.                                                                      
                                                                                
             3.5.4.1      Apply pressure to the system.  Back off pressure by   
turning off valve supplying gases to the system.  If the pressure               
on the gage drops, a leak on the system exists.  If the pressure                
on the gage does not drop, the system is tight.                                 
                                                                                
             3.5.4.2      After applying pressure, wait two or three minutes    
to ensure pressure does not drop.                                               
                                                                                
   3.6    Use fire retardant materials aboard or adjacent to the craft for   |
staging, screening, temporary covers, shelters,                  
deck covering, and ventilation ducts.                                           
                                                                                
       3.6.1        Lumber, including plywood, shall be treated in              
accordance with MIL-L-19140, and, in addition to the markings                   
required by that military specification, shall be branded with                  
the date of treatment.                                                          
                                                                                
       3.6.2        Storage of material aboard the craft shall be               
limited to that which is required for work in progress.                         
                                                                                
             3.6.2.1      Crating and packing shall be removed prior to         
bringing the equipment or working material aboard, unless                       
equipment or working material may be damaged during handling, in                
which case the crating and packing shall be removed immediately                 
after the equipment or working material is brought aboard.

   4.1    Equipment Instruction Manual will be referenced in the                
invoking Work Item.                                                             
                                                                                
                                                                                
   4.2 When commercial repair facilities other than the original                
equipment manufacturer (OEM) express an interest in performing                  
repair and overhaul work, they must demonstrate to the                          
appropriate contracting authority the capability to perform the                 
work.  Capability to perform circuit breaker overhaul and repair                
work includes having the facilities, trained mechanics, and                     
access to the OEM`s qualified parts and repair procedures.  Use                 
of non-qualified restricted parts violates the integrity of the                 
circuit breaker, nullifying the breaker`s prior qualification                   
under the QPL process.  Restricted parts must be obtained from                  
the OEM either directly or via (if available) the Federal stock                 
system.  If a restricted part is replaced with an unqualified                   
part, the qualification of the particular circuit breaker is                    
revoked until the full set of QPL required tests are repeated and               
submitted to NAVSEA for approval.

        SUPPLEMENTAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COFFERDAM PATCHES                         
                                                                                
Note:  This attachment takes precedence in case of conflict with                
the requirements of 0994-LP-007-8020.                                           
                                                                                
1.  Procedures for blanking hull openings shall include steps for               
ensuring that the valve being removed or the system being opened                
corresponds to the hull opening being blanked by divers.  Ship's                
docking drawings and piping plans shall be used to identify and                 
correct hull opening.  Openings shall be located either by                      
hammering on the valve or adjacent structure inside the ship and                
the diver sensing the noise and vibration or by the use of                      
locator lines suspended from known frames on deck.  Divers shall                
verify that the opening corresponds to the type and size shown on               
the docking drawing.                                                            
                                                                                
2.  Cofferdam patches used to seal sea suctions, discharges,                    
ballast tank flooding valves, and other hull openings shall be                  
designed to provide a minimum factor of safety of 1.25 for                      
bending and 2.5 for sheer on the yield strength of materials when               
subject to external water pressure forces.  Provide calculations                
with Process Control Procedure.                                                 
                                                                                
3.  Cofferdams that seal to the ship's hull shall be templated                  
from the hull to ensure proper fit and minimize gasket material                 
thickness.  Typical tools and techniques for templating are shown               
on drawings 6698709 and 6697929.  Gaskets shall be rubber or                    
closed-cell neoprene per ASTM D-1056-91, Grade 2CQ.  Thickness                  
shall be the minimum required to achieve a seal, but in no case                 
greater than two inches.                                                        
                                                                                
4.  All cofferdam patches and associated attachment hardware                    
shall be visually inspected for cracks, corrosion, and                          
deformation prior to installation and deficiencies corrected.                   
Gaskets shall be inspected for damage, cleanliness, adhesive                    
bond, and pliability and repaired or replaced as required prior                 
to each use.                                                                    
                                                                                
5.  Cofferdam patches shall be secured to permanent structure                   
such as sea chest grates or splitter bars.  Where permanent                     
structure is not available in the system being worked (e.g.,                    
discharges), hogging lines to nearby structure or to weather                    
decks shall serve as the primary device for securing the patch to               
the hull.  A secondary attachment to temporary structure (e.g.,                 
spider devices) may be installed in the system to help seal the                 
patch when the primary device (i.e. hogging line) will not                      
provide sufficient sealing force because of hull configuration.                 
                                                                                
6.  Eductors shall only be used to dewater systems.  Cofferdams                 
with eductors shall be vented to the surface and positive seal                  
valve shall be installed to prevent backflow when the eductor is                
secured.  A cofferdam seal must still be confirmed internally as                
internal connections are disturbed.  Surface venting provides an                
easy method for confirmation of cofferdam seal prior to                         
disturbance of internal connections.  Once a system is dewatered,               
eductors shall be secured to assess performance of the blank.                   
Eductors shall not be                                                           
active when internal ship's piping is being opened.  Eductor                    
water supplies                                                                  
shall be suspended via strain reliefs to nearby structure or                    
attachment points so that the weight of the hose is not being                   
carried by the blank.  Eductor water supply valve shall be                      
clearly marked.                                                                 
                                                                                
7.  When the installed cofferdam patch will serve as the only                   
barrier to the sea (one-valve protection) for any period of time,               
the Process Control Procedure shall provide for Ship's Force sign-              
off prior to use.

numbers in accordance with 2.c.                                                 
                                                                                
         3.2.1  Documentation related to hazardous waste generated solely by    
the physical actions of Ship's Force or Navy employees (termed Navy-Generated   
Hazardous Waste) on board the vessel shall only bear a generator                
identification number issued to the Navy pursuant to applicable law.            
                                                                                
         3.2.2  Documentation related to hazardous waste generated solely by    
the physical actions of contractor personnel (termed Contractor-Generated       
Hazardous Waste) shall bear a generator identification number issued to the     
contractor pursuant to applicable law.  Regardless of the presence of other     
material in or on the shipboard systems or structure which may have qualified   
a waste stream as hazardous, where the contractor performs work on a system or  
structure using materials (whether or not the use of such materials was         
specified by the Navy) which by themselves would cause the waste from such      
work to be a hazardous waste, documentation related to such waste shall only    
bear a generator number issued to the contractor.                               
                                                                                
         3.2.3  Documentation related to hazardous waste generated by the       
combined physical actions of Navy and contractor personnel (termed              
Co-Generated Hazardous Waste) shall bear a generator identification number      
issued to the contractor pursuant to applicable law and shall also cite in the  
remarks block a generator identification number issued to the Navy pursuant to  
applicable law.  When the contractor merely drains a system and such drainage   
creates hazardous waste or the contractor performs work on system or            
structure using materials which by themselves would not cause the waste from    
such work to be hazardous waste but such work nonetheless creates a hazardous   
waste, documentation related to such waste shall bear a generator               
identification number issued to the contractor and shall also cite in the       
remarks block a generator identification number issued to the Navy.  The        
contractor shall sign the generator certification on the Uniform Hazardous      
Waste Manifest whenever use of the manifest is required for disposal.  The      
contractor shall obtain SUPERVISOR's concurrence with the categorization of     
the wastes as co-generated before completion of the manifest.  Manifests        
prepared shall be presented to the SUPERVISOR for completion after the          
hazardous waste has been identified.                                            
                                                                                
    3.3  If the contractor, while performing work at a Government facility,     
cannot obtain a separate generator identification number from the state in      
which the availability will be performed, the contractor shall notify the       
SUPERVISOR within three business days of receipt of written notification by     
the state.  After obtaining approval of the SUPERVISOR, the contractor shall    
use the Navy site generator identification number and insert in the remarks     
block the contractor generator identification number issued for the site        
where his main facilities are located.                                          
                                                                                
    3.4  If, for availabilities at a contractor-owned or controlled facility,   
the Navy cannot obtain a separate generator identification number for use at    
a contractor facility, the Navy shall notify the contractor within three        
business days of receipt of notification by the state.  The contractor shall    
dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with 2.a and 3.2.3.

contract.                                                                       
                                                                                
4.  NOTES:                                                                      
                                                                                
    4.1  The waste identified in 3.5 is based on the best information           
available at the time of preparation of the solicitation.  Hazardous waste      
generated during the actual performance of the work may vary in type or amount  
from waste identified in 3.5 which may result in renegotiation for credit or    
increase pursuant to Paragraph (b) of 2.c.  The contractor is expected to use   
best management practice to identify and dispose of all hazardous waste.  Some  
of the substances identified in 3.5 may be neutralized, recycled, or otherwise  
removed from the requirements of Subtitle C of 2.a.  Inclusion of these         
substances in the waste identified in 3.5 does not preclude the contractor      
from taking action consistent with 2.a to reduce or eliminate the hazardous     
constituents of any waste required to be disposed of under the contract.        
Processes that add hazardous constituents to the bilges may require that bilge  
water be disposed of as a hazardous waste.                                      
                                                                                
    4.2  Hazardous wastes are determined by one or more of the following        
methods:                                                                        
                                                                                
         4.2.1  Chemical analysis which shows that the material                 
characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and/or toxicity       
(Toxicity Characteristic Leachate Procedure - TCLP) exceed the limits for that  
material in 40 CFR 261.20 Subpart C.                                            
                                                                                
         4.2.2  Reference to the applicable Material Safety Data Sheets         
(MSDS), or                                                                      
                                                                                
         4.2.3  Applying knowledge of the hazardous characteristics of the      
waste in light of the materials or the process used.                            
                                                                                
    4.3  Asbestos, bilge water, oil/water, and PCB's apply only in those        
states listing them as hazardous waste.

unit shall not exceed 10,000 PSIG.                                              
                                                                                
         3.3.3  Hydraulic fittings and hoses shall be able to withstand at      
least two times the maximum working pressure of the hydraulic pump unit.        
                                                                                
         3.3.4  Tube stub anchoring device shall have slots in the thrust       
collar or an alternate means of visual verification that the tube stub is not   
being pulled through the tube hole during the pulling operation.                
                                                                                
         3.3.5  Equip the hydraulic tube pulling unit with a remote shut-down   
device.  The shut-down device shall be operated by the tube stub anchoring      
device operator and shall be such that the hydraulic tube pulling unit can be   
operated only when the shut-down device is activated.                           
                                                                                
    3.4  Prepare tube stubs so that at least the following conditions exist     
prior to accomplishing tube stub removal operations.                            
                                                                                
         3.4.1  Cut and remove tubes from the boilers so that a tube stub       
remains.  The length of the remaining tube stub shall not exceed one inch,      
measured from the fireside surface of the tube sheet, and shall not be less     
than 3/16 inch, measured from the fireside of the tube sheet.                   
                                                                                
    3.5  Accomplish hydraulic tube removal using pull-stretch-fail method. The  
pull-stretch-fail method involves anchoring one side of the tube stub and       
pulling the other side of the tube stub with the hydraulic puller unit.  This   
action causes the tube stub to stretch and then ultimately fail.  The

faced hammer; tap bearing into the housing until it contacts the bearing oil    
retainer.                                                                       
                                                                                
                3.3.8.33 While holding bearing spacer in place with one end     
resting on the inner race of the guide bushing, install thrust bearing into     
pump frame.                                                                     
                                                                                
                3.3.8.34 Install thrust bearing retainer plate and capscrews.

the inner race of both the guide and thrust bearings after bearing retainer     
plate is installed.                                                             
                                                                                
                3.3.8.35 Assemble volute backhead and volute onto the pump      
frame.  Torque fasteners from 45 to 55 foot pounds.  Ensure matchmarks are      
aligned.                                                                        
                                                                                
                3.3.8.36 Install pump shaft into guide bearing (through         
volute) and tap into place with lead hammer until shaft shoulder rests against  
the oil retainer.                                                               
                                                                                
                3.3.8.37 Install drive gear onto the pump shaft using a new     
lockwasher.  Tighten retainer nut with spanner wrench.  Ensure locknut is       
sufficiently tightened so that the drive gear, bearing inner races (on the      
guide and thrust bearings), bearing spacer, oil retainer and shaft shoulder     
are tightly in place without end clearance between adjacent parts.  Parts can   
be checked for tightness by reaching through the frame opening and turning the  
bearing spacer.  If the bearing spacer turns independently of the shaft, it is  
an indication that end clearance exists.  Tightening the drive gear locknut     
should correct the problem.
