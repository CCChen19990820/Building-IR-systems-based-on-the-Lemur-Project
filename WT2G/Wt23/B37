This single volume combines four reports on key Visual FoxPro<FONT SIZE="-1">(tm)</FONT> programming topics, edited by Whil Hentzen. The four authors are highly skilled developers with special expertise in their subject areas. The reports are:
<OL>

<LI> <B><I>Visual FoxPro Data Dictionary</I></B>, by Doug Hennig, explains how the data dictionary built into Visual FoxPro 3 gives you a way to describe and manage the data elements that make up an application--filenames, field names, types, sizes, and index expressions--so you can use them to build data-driven applications. Hennig writes, "Think of the data dictionary as the engine that drives the application. When you make a change to the data dictionary, any data-driven module will automatically adjust to the data definitions. No more hand writing or modifying database maintenance routines!"
<LI> <B><I>Developing Client/Server Applications with Visual FoxPro and SQL Server<FONT SIZE="-1">(tm)</FONT></I></B>, by Robert Green, explains why you need client/server applications and discusses the additional components required for them. The report examines the interaction of Visual FoxPro and SQL Server, how a client/server application is structured, and how to use the Upsizing Wizard to move Visual FoxPro data into SQL Server. Explore the sample application included. 
<LI> <B><I>Visual FoxPro Forms and Functions</I></B>, by Stephen A. Sawyer, provides a detailed examination of the Visual FoxPro Form Designer, forms, and controls. The code includes FoxPro&#174;-specific Xbase language extensions. Numerous comparisons are made between FoxPro 2 and Visual FoxPro--to help you leverage your knowledge of  the previous versions.
<LI> <B><I>Object-Oriented Programming with Visual FoxPro</I></B>, by David Frankenbach, is all about objects--what they are, why you need them, how you create them, and how you use them. The report covers beginning through intermediate levels of object-oriented programming. Your structural programming techniques will still be valuable, but by the end of the report you'll appreciate the power that object orientation brings to Visual FoxPro.<P>

<A NAME="intro"></A>
<H2>Introduction </H2>
We have written this report to assist you in making your next mailings more successful. It is based on the 
most frequent questions we are asked by our customers and our many years of experience  in the mail 
order business. <P>
On a daily basis we try to help our customers to select mailing lists that will make their mailing a success.  We hope you too will become a customer. <P>
 <A NAME="factor"> </A>
<H2>Factors that Determine the Success of a Mailing</H2> 
 Besides a quality mailing list there are several other important considerations which influence the success 
of your mailing. Following are the most important factors: <P>
 <A NAME="offer"></A>
<UL><UL><H3>The Offer </H3></UL></UL>
There is no question that if you do everything else right but the potential customer is not interested in 
y6your offer, your mailing will still not succeed. If your offer is of no benefit to the recipient, is too 
expensive, is of no interest, etch., it cannot succeed. The product, service or opportunity you are offering 
must represent an important benefit to the reader.  <P>
<A NAME="presen"></A> 
<UL><UL><H3>Presentation of Offer</H3> </UL></UL>
Since the mail order buyer cannot see the product or service, cannot touch it, and cannot smell it the 
presentation of your offer is of the utmost importance.  <P>
Your offer should  be  presented  in  a professional manner. The customer will form a quick opinion of 
your mail order company by the material he receives. Your sales letter and other promotional material 
should be clearly written so your reader will fully understand the offer.   Sloppy and unprofessional mailing 
pieces will be a definite turn off the reader. Daily, millions of pieces of direct mail land in the nearest waste 
paper basket for just that reason. <P>
If you are writing your own promotional material or sales letter, the most important rule to follow is:  <BR>
	<UL><LI>Place the emphasis on the reader and stress what your offer will do for him. All the major benefits must be clearly stated in your offer. Selfish marketing, that is writing about yourself or your company, is of no interest to the reader.  <BR>
	<UL>His sole interest is: "What is this going to do for me?" </UL></UL>
Everything  about  your  presentation  is important: The envelope, the sales letter, the brochure or circular, 
etch. <P>
<A NAME="env"></A>
<UL><UL><H3>The Envelope </H3></UL></UL>
There are experts and consultants in Direct Mail who will put Substantial emphasis on the appearance and 
presentation of the envelope. It is suggested  that the envelope will decide whether the recipient will open 
it or not. In my opinion, as long  as the envelope looks professional the recipient will open  it. <P> 
 Remember, curiosity is a part of human nature. Envelopes which are most likely to get tossed without being 
opened are those that have a non-mistakable identity of junk mail. Like those window envelopes that 
declare in huge bold letters that you are about to win a Million Dollars. <P>
 Should you use a label, handwrite the name and address, or type it?  I do not think it makes a lot of 
difference.  No question a neatly handwritten, or typed address on an envelope will look better than a 
label, but this may not make a great Impact on the overall success of the mailing, Let's keep in mind it's 
what's inside that will determine if the reader will reply to you, or make a purchase from you.  If you are 
determined, however, to improve the chances that the envelope will get opened use the following 
technique: <BR>
<B>1.</B> Do not show name, or return address. The disadvantage with this approach is that the Post Office can not notify you regarding undeliverable mail. <BR>
 <B>2.</B> If you do decide to use a return address show only the address.  It will create curiosity. <BR>
<B> 
3.</B> If the envelope is typed or written, so much the better The curiosity factor will definitely be on your side. <BR>
 <A NAME="first"></A>
<H3><UL><UL>First Class or Bulk Mail </H3></UL></UL>
 Envelopes  which weigh less than 1 oz (32cents postage) should generally be mailed First Class. The 
comparable bulk mail rate is 22.6 cents, but bulk mail takes longer, and even worse, some of it is not 
delivered at all. The Direct Marketing Association estimates that from 5% to 15% of bulk mall does not get 
delivered. <P>
First Class is fast, dependable and makes more of an impact. If the weight, however, requires 
Postage of 55 cents, 78 cents, or even more the mailer generally has no choice 
but to go with bulk mail. <P>
<A NAME="season"></A> 
<H2>Seasonal Factors </H2> 
A great deal is written about "mailing at the right time". I do suggest you ignore most of the information. The 
truth is almost all mail order companies will mail on a year-round schedule, except if the offer is of a 
Seasonal nature. We recommend you mail on a year around basis. I do suggest, however, that you do not 
mail between December 15 and December 31. Additionally, it is advisable to plan so that your mailings do 
not arrive just prior to one of the National Holidays. Based on our business over a number of years we 
have ranked the months of the year in the order of highest and lowest volume as follows: <BR>
 February - January - March -April - October and September are generally the busiest months.<BR> 
 November - May - August - July - June and December will generally  be slower than the above.  We have, 
however, experienced a number of "surprises" and exceptions to the above. <P>
 <A NAME="lists"></A> 
<H2>The Mailing List </H2>
 Choosing the right mailing list for your mailing is critical otherwise all your other efforts and expenses will 
be wasted. <P>
  <A NAME="types"></A>
<UL><UL><H3>Types of Mailing Lists: </H3></UL></UL>
 There are primarily 3 types of mailing lists: 
 <A NAME="built"></A>
<B>1. </B>Built Lists: <BR>
 (also called Response Lists) These lists are built from advertising and direct marketing  responses/replies. <P>  
Most likely these are the lists you will be using primarily.  Most mailing list companies will either build their 
own mailing lists, or will buy names from various mail order companies. The names will generally have 
been obtained through responses to advertisements. Other lists which have been generated through 
advertising are generally newer names and will be more responsive. <P>
 There are many sub-listings under the above, for  example,  opportunity  seekers  are individuals who are 
interested in all types of new business and extra income opportunities. MLM names (multi-level marketing, 
also referred to as network marketers),  are individuals who have a keen interest in multi-level marketing 
opportunities, etch. <P>
<A NAME="compiled"></A> 
<B>2.</B> Compiled Lists:  <BR>
Names from these lists are taken from various directories, such as a telephone directory, individuals on 
these lists  have not responded to an offer, but they fit a certain  category,  such  as  CPA's  or Physicians. <P>
 <A NAME="buyers"></A>
<B>3.</B> Buyer Lists: <BR>
 These names are obtained from various mail order companies who make their customer lists available for 
rental. Individuals on these lists have made a purchase. <P>
 <A NAME="obtain"></A>
<H2>Obtaining Quality Names </H2>
Quality  mailing  lists  are  created  and maintained at considerable expense to the owner of the list. And 
when you buy a quality list the results will speak for themselves.  <P>
We strongly recommend that you do not seek out the least expensive list. Such a list could become the most 
expensive list you ever rented. If you rent a "cheap list" and out of a mailing of 1,000 pieces you receive 
200 "bad address returns", your cheap list has become very expensive. Or even worse, you may not 
get any orders.  <P>
 Most mailing lists will deteriorate at about 1.5% to 3% per month. This is unavoidable - people move, close 
P.O. Boxes, and the computer operator makes errors when the data is entered.  Therefore a list of 1,000 
names which is approximately one month old will subsequently have somewhere between 15 and 30 bad 
address returns.  <P>
 <A NAME="in"></A>
<UL><UL><H3>In-House Names</H3> </UL></UL>
If you can determine that a mailing list company generates its names "in-house", (generally through 
advertising), you will most often have a considerably higher quality list. Ask the mailing list company what 
the ad says and in what magazines it appears so you can check it out yourself. <P>
 <A NAME="hot"></A>
<UL><UL><H3>Hot-Line Lists</H3></UL></UL> 
 These names should be less than 30 days old.   if you buy such a list determine how old the names are. But 
don't get too hung up on the age of the names. Whether a name is 5,15, or 45 days old does not make much 
difference.  <P>
<A NAME="new"></A>
<H2>Are They New Names </H2>
One of the most frequent questions we are asked by a prospective buyer Is: "Have these names been used 
before and will they be used again." I must be honest with you, this is one of the least intelligent question 
that could be asked.<BR> What is even worse, there are mailing list companies who claim that the names have never been used before and will not be used again. This is a blatant lie and it assumes that the prospective  customer is a fool. Like rental car companies who rent cars more than once so do mailing list companies rent names more than once. <BR>There are not enough names around to do otherwise. A responsible  mailing list  company  will, however, constantly rotate names as to prevent over use. and (this is important) find out what program you are using and make sure the names are not used again for the same program. <P>
<A NAME="test"></A> 
<H2>Testing A List</H2>
 I Suggest before you rent a few thousand names from company X, why not try a few hundred; or, if at all 
possible 1,000. A test of about 1,000 names should give you a good idea as to the effectiveness of the list. 
Tests of less than 500 names are quite unreliable.   <P>
 If  mailing  First  Class, responses/orders  will  start  coming  in approximately 10 to 20 days. As a general 
rule, about 70% of your orders will come In the first 30 days and the remainder will come in during the next 
several months, If mailing bulk rate, results will start coming in after about 3 weeks and about 70% of the 
orders will be received within approximately 60 days. The remainder will come in over many months. <P>
<A NAME="perform"></A>
<H2>List Performance</H2>: 
 The most popular question by a long shot is: "What kind of a response can I expect?" Unfortunately, there 
is no way to tell. There are so many factors that will influence the Success of a mailing.  Some have been 
discussed here.<BR> Other factors that may have an effect include some of the following: weather patterns, 
national and local news which may Influence peoples thinking at any given time, the price of the offer 
(generally, the higher the price the lower the response), etch. <P>
 Some offers allow the seller to make a profit at a response rate of 1.5%. Some multi.level marketers report 
initial response rates of 3% to 10% and even higher. I suggest that before you mail, determine all your 
costs and based on that you come up with a break even figure.<BR>The number of orders you must receive to recover all your costs. Then carefully monitor the results. Before you roll out the big guns, be sure the 
figures work out okay. This may take some patience on your part and changes in the offer. Maybe the 
price Is too high or too low. <P>
<A NAME="positive"></A>
<H2>Be Postive </H2>
A positive mind set is an absolute must for any entrepreneur, but positive thinking should not be confused 
with unrealistic dreams,  The primary Purpose of any mailing Is to find new customers, not to get rich in a 
few months.

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="verhulst.gif"></font>
<P>
</center>


<P><DD>
Dr. VerHulst received his B.S. in Zoology at the University of Michigan in 1978, and he received his M.D. from Wayne State University School of Medicine in 1982.

<p><DD>

Dr. VerHulst is a cutting edge medical doctor who embraces the naturopathic philosophy of health.  He believes the foundation of good health is good nutrition, to prevent disease as well as to restore good health that has been lost.

<p>
<DD>
At age 39, Dr. VerHulst is renowned as a lecturer in schools, churches, and organizations, and has appeared on television and radio.

<p>
<DD>
The VerHulst Health and Nutrition Education Foundation, whose purpose is to teach the principles of preventive medicine on the on the basis of proper nutrition, physical fitness, stress management, and other lifestyle factors which promote good health.
<DD><p>
Susan has enjoyed hosting a radio program for the past 10 years, and also currently enjoys supporting her husband's work in the health and nutrition field.
<P><DD>
When Dr, Donald Verhulst graduated from medical school in 1982, he 
embarked upon a rather unorthodox path for a conventionally trained 
medical doctor He embraced the Naturopathic philosophy that 
emphasizes natural agents as the means for health and well-being. Dr 
Don believes the foundation of health is good nutrition to prevent 
disease, and to restore lost health.
<P><DD>
<I>"Health is a balanced state achieved by focusing on two 
areas: detoxification or cleaning out the body and the 
building up of the blood and the immune system. As I 
travel, teaching people how to get healthy and how to stay 
healthy using LAMETCO'S all natural products, I stress 
the four "No Choice" foundation products. The products no 
one should go without"</I><P><DD>
What are they? There are certain basic products that 
contain the essential elements for maintaining good health, 
and LAMETCO has them all. The base of these products is 
2001: a completely balanced combination vitamin, mineral 
and antioxidant. Detoxification begins in the colon. Daily 
use of LAMETCO'S Inner Balance Combination Dayzymes 
and Night Cleanse allows proper digestion, absorption and 
elimination to take place. Nature 's Essentials is our 3-in-I 
product that Dr Don refers to as food for your immune 
system. This product builds the blood and immune system 
better than any other product on the market today. Bio-
Cell is LAMETCO'S cost-effective, powerful super 
antioxidant. The anti-aging properties in Bio-Cell protect 
against the diseases associated with aging. Bio-Cell is the 
free radical scavenger for the 90%. These four products 
are the "No Choice" products that guarantee the proper 
nutrition for optimal health. There is no one on earth 
whose health problems do not have a nutritional 
component. Remember when we supply proper nutrition 
daily we may say it is never too late to heal, naturally
<P><DD>
Dr Don has dedicated his life to teaching the principles of 
preventive medicine. He is the founder of the Verhulst 
Health and Nutrition Education Foundation where proper 
nutrition, physical fitness, stress management and any 
lifestyle factors that promote good health are studied and 
taught. When he is not busy traveling or lecturing, Dr. Don 
spends time at home with his wife Susan. He enjoys 
cooking natural foods and working on his music. Susan 
has hosted a radio program for the last 10 years and 
supports her husband% work.
<P><DD>
We at LAMETCO say thank you to Dr Don for his 
dedication and knowledge.

<H2>What is the purpose of Peak Performance?</H2>

<P><DD>Peak Performance is an all-natural blend of herbs in a balanced 
formula designed to increase energy levels. It helps burn fat by 
increasing thermogenesis, or the rate at which calories are burned, so 
that the food we eat is burned as energy as opposed to stored as fat.

<P><DD>
Chromium, a trace mineral also found in Peak Performance, is 
reported to lower cholesterol and actually help stabilize and regulate 
blood sugar levels. Over 90% of all Americans are believed lobe 
chromium deficient.
<P><DD>
However, Peak Performance does much more than increase energy 
levels, burn flit, and build muscles. Here are just some of the many 
historic uses of the herbs found in Peak Performance.

<H2>Questions & Answers</H2>
<B>What about the Ephedrines that are in Peak Performance. Are they 
safe?</B>
<UL><UL>
<P><DD>Whenever a plant or an herb is processed and its components are 
separated, they are taken out of their natural state, in which they were 
designed to work in balance with one another.

<P><DD>Pharmaceutical companies concentrate herbs and extract ONLY the 
ingredient they are looking for. This can be very dangerous because 
herbs were designed to be taken as a whole. Each substance in 
herbal blends balances the others. Unnatural processing can make 
powerful drugs and medicines.

<P><DD>Ephedrine is used today to treat many ailments.
It is found in many over-the-counter medicines such as Sudafed, 
Actifed, Dexatrim, etc. Millions of people take these drugs every day, 
and the FDA classifies them as safe for internal use.
<P><DD>
Peak Performance has a very small amount of naturally-occurring 
ephedrines which have been used for thousands of years by the 
Chinese. When used as directed, Peak Performance can greatly 
benefit people of all ages.

</UL></UL>

<B>Is the caffeine found in Kola Nut different than caffeine in coffee?</B>
<UL><UL>
<P><DD>Kola nut is included in Peak Performance because of its ability to 
increase thermogenesis, or fat burning! There is not enough caffeine 
in a capsule of Peak Performance to cause stimulation on its own.
<P><DD>
There is a big difference between the caffeine in kola nut and the 
caffeine in coffee. It is like the difference between eating a candy bar 
and eating an apple. Kola nut contains naturally occuring
caffeine.
<P><DD>
Naturally occurring caffeine does not metabolize in your body in the 
same way that processed caffeine, found in other products, does.
<P><DD>
Caffeine has been found to increase energy levels by as much as 
25%. Up to 200 mg per day of naturally-occurring caffeine has been 
shown to safely improve brain function.
<P><DD>
Each Peak Performance capsule has approximately 1/4 the amount of 
caffeine found in 1 cup of coffee.
Processed caffeine should be avoided when possible.
<P><DD>
The main reason to avoid coffee is not the caffeine; it is the cadmium . 
Cadmium facilitates all eight mechanisms by which cancer is thought 
to occur in your body.
<P><DD>
Peak Performance is a natural alternative for those individuals who 
are dependent on coffee and soft drinks to keep them going. Peak 
Performance is a great way to start your mornings instead of polluting 
your body with sugar, coffee, and unhealthy foods.
</UL></UL>

<B>Can Peak Performance help with diabetes, high blood pressure, and 
heart disease?</B>
<UL><UL><P><DD>
YES! Peak Performance has helped many people I know who suffer 
from all three of these diseases. It helps diabetics because it can help 
stabilize the blood sugar level.
<P><DD>
Also, Harvard University did a study on Ma Huang, Kola Nut, and 
Willow Bark (the main ingredients found in Peak Performance) and 
found that they actually lowered blood pressure!
<P><DD>
The herbs found in Peak Performance have been shown to beneficial 
for the heart by lowering total cholesterol level while increasing the 
HDL/LDL ratio.
</UL></UL>


<B>My child has been diagnosed with ADD, can Peak Performance help?</B>
<UL><UL><P><DD>
Most definitely. In fact, drugs containing ephedrine are often 
prescribed for children with ADD.
<P><DD>
Peak Performance can be a safe all natural alternative for both 
children and adults who suffer from ADD, without the harmful side 
effects of prescription drugs.

<P><DD>

<center>(Information sample from the Wellness Web)</center><BR>
<b><i>What is the right way to treat prostate cancer?</i></b> Four methods are often used in the
United States to treat prostate cancer today.  The first is surgery to remove the cancer.  The second is
radiation therapy, which uses different types of high energy radiation to kill the cancer cells.  The third
is cryotherapy or cryoablation, which is a way of freezing the prostate to destroy the organ. 
(Cryotherapy is widely considered to be an experimental procedure at this time.) The fourth is
hormonal therapy, in which different types of hormone are used on their own or in combination with
other methods to stop the cancer cells from growing.  All these methods have benefits and risks. 
There is no one "right" way to treat prostate cancer.  The treatment that offers the best option for one
patient may be quite wrong for another patient.  Making the proper choice of treatment for a particular
patient is sometimes very difficult.  The doctor will want to consider the age and general health of the
patient, the extent of the patient's disease, how the patient feels about the different treatment options,
and what the risks are for each possible treatment.  It is true that for some patients treatment may be
unnecessary or even unwise.  In these patients the doctor will usually practice what is called "watchful
waiting," and will monitor the patient carefully by giving regular check-ups.<p>

<H2>The Instantaneous Relaxation Method</H2>


<UL><UL><font size=-1>The following is an excerpt from the Hypnotic Suggestions page. For the longer standard hypnotic relaxation method  <A HREF="http://www.utu.fi/~jounsmed/asc/hyp/auto.hypnosis.htm">visit their page</A>.</font></UL></UL>





<I>For informational use only, absolutely not for hypnotising others</I><P>





<DD>This one is for experienced self hypnotist. With this you should be  able  to


enter a trance within less than a second (with practice).


<P>





<DD>Choose a direction to stare in.


<P>





<DD>Stare in that direction for a few seconds.


<P>





<DD>Close your eyes and feel the difference. Your eyes feel  much  more


relaxed  than when they were open. savor this feeling and expand it as much as


you can.


<P>





<DD>The feeling is so relaxing that you don't want to open your eyes, but you  must


try.  The next time you open your eyes they will be heavier and want to remain


closed.


<P>





<DD>Open your eyes half as much as you did last time. stare for half the time.


<P>





<DD>Close your eyes. The relaxation is so soothing, so total  so  wonderful.  your


eyes  are so relaxed. Your eyelids will be heavier the next time you open your


eyes and they will only open half as much as they did this  time.  Savor  this


relaxing feeling for as long as you are able.


<P>





<DD>Continue this process until you are unable to open  your  eyes,  despite  your


many  attempts.  when  you  are  no  longer able to open your eyes, you are in

<h2>50 Nutritional healing tips</H2>





<UL><UL><font size=-1>The following is an excerpt from the SUMERIA page. For their complete tips, <A HREF="http://lablinks.com/sumeria/health/50tips.html">visit their page</A>.</font></UL></UL>





<DD> IS YOUR REFRIGERATOR AN in-house pharmacy? Are doctors telling patients:


"Take two asparagus and call me in the morning"? Not quite. But these days


there's more evidence than ever that good nutrition is good medicine.


Nutritional factors play an important role in preventing cardiovascular


disease and some forms of cancer. Careful meal planning can help control high


blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes and other conditions that you


may think have nothing to do with nutrition. <P>





<UL><UL><H3><B> HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</B></H3> </UL></UL>





<DD>Potassium may influence high blood pressure. There have been a number of


studies linking low intake of potassium and increased incidence of high blood


pressure. A small but impressive study from Temple University School of


Medicine goes one step beyond those findings. Ten men with normal blood


pressure were put on two experimental diets: one providing normal, the other


low, amounts of potassium. The men spent nine days on each diet. On the normal


potassium diet, their blood pressures showed no significant change. But when


on the low-potassium diet, their average arterial pressure (which takes into


account both systolic and diastolic pressures) increased from an average of


90.9 to an average of 95. The men also retained more sodium and fluid (New


England Journal of Medicine, May 4, 1989). <BR>


 <DD> One of the researchers speculates that a low potassium intake may cause the


sodium retention that, over time, raises blood pressure. These findings need


to be confirmed by other studies, but they underscore the importance of eating


potassium-rich fruits and vegetables. (See "Good Sources of Key Nutrients.") <P>

<h2>WHAT IS TAI CHI</h2>

<UL><UL><font size=-1>The following is an excerpt from a Tai Chi page. For their complete information and links, <A HREF="http://frank.mtsu.edu/~jpurcell/Taichi/taichi.html">visit their page</A>.</font></UL></UL>

<DD>Tai chi is a Chinese martial art that is primarily practiced for its health benefits, including a means for dealing with tension and stress.  Among the martial arts, there are two basic types: the hard martial arts and the soft martial arts.  Examples of the hard martial arts are karate and kung fu (or wushu).  Examples of the soft martial arts are pa qua and tai chi.<BR>

<DD>Tai chi emphasizes complete relaxation, and is essentially a form of meditation, or what has been called "meditation in motion."  Unlike the hard martial arts, tai chi is characterized by soft, slow, flowing movements that emphasize force, rather than brute strength.  Though it is soft, slow, and flowing, the movements are executed precisely.<P>

<LI>No matter what book on the subject of mail order that you read, no matter what mail order course you 
take<DD>All the experts agree, that to earn the really big money in mail order, you must be able to 
produce the product that you are selling. 
<LI>You must drive your product acquisition cost down to rock bottom in order to make really big money

<LI>For those mail order dealers who sell books, reports and manuals, the usual answer is to write to write 
your own material.<DD>Your labor and the raw printing costs are your only production costs, thus making 
your product cost as low as it can possibly be.  
<LI>The rub is that many order dealer do not have the time or expertise to write their own books, manuals 
or reports. <DD>They need these things provided for them while still maintaining that lowest possible 
acquisition cost.

them. Just fill the order with the printed sheets and watch the bucks roll in.

<I>For informational use only, absolutely not for hypnotizing others</I><P>

This one is for experienced self hypnotist. With this you should be  able  to
enter a trance within less than a second (with practice).
<P>

Choose a direction to stare in.
<P>

stare in that direction for a few seconds.
<P>

close your eyes and feel the difference. Your eyes feel  much  more
relaxed  than when they were open. savor this feeling and expand it as much as
you can.
<P>

The feeling is so relaxing that you don't want to open your eyes, but you  must
try.  The next time you open your eyes they will be heavier and want to remain
closed.
<P>

Open your eyes half as much as you did last time. stare for half the time.
<P>

close your eyes. The relaxation is so soothing, so total  so  wonderful.  your
eyes  are so relaxed. Your eyelids will be heavier the next time you open your
eyes and they will only open half as much as they did this  time.  Savor  this
relaxing feeling for as long as you are able.
<P>

Continue this process until you are unable to open  your  eyes,  despite  your
many  attempts.  when  you  are  no  longer able to open your eyes, you are in
trance.
<P>

maximize this relaxation, fee it flooding throughout your entire body, washing
from  your eyelids, through your eyes, head, neck, body. entirely relaxed . In
one split second, your entire body has totally relaxed.

<h2>50 Nutritional healing tips</H2>

<UL><UL><font size=-1>(The following is an excerpt from the SUMERIA page. For their complete tips, <A HREF="http://lablinks.com/sumeria/health/50tips.html">visit their page</A>.)</font></UL></UL>

 IS YOUR REFRIGERATOR AN in-house pharmacy? Are doctors telling patients:
"Take two asparagus and call me in the morning"? Not quite. But these days
there's more evidence than ever that good nutrition is good medicine.
Nutritional factors play an important role in preventing cardiovascular
disease and some forms of cancer. Careful meal planning can help control high
blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes and other conditions that you
may think have nothing to do with nutrition. <P>

<UL><UL><H3><B> HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</B></H3> </UL></UL>

Potassium may influence high blood pressure. There have been a number of
studies linking low intake of potassium and increased incidence of high blood
pressure. A small but impressive study from Temple University School of
Medicine goes one step beyond those findings. Ten men with normal blood
pressure were put on two experimental diets: one providing normal, the other
low, amounts of potassium. The men spent nine days on each diet. On the normal
potassium diet, their blood pressures showed no significant change. But when
on the low-potassium diet, their average arterial pressure (which takes into
account both systolic and diastolic pressures) increased from an average of
90.9 to an average of 95. The men also retained more sodium and fluid (New
England Journal of Medicine, May 4, 1989). <BR>
  One of the researchers speculates that a low potassium intake may cause the
sodium retention that, over time, raises blood pressure. These findings need
to be confirmed by other studies, but they underscore the importance of eating
potassium-rich fruits and vegetables. (See "Good Sources of Key Nutrients.") <P>

<B>Aeron chair<BR>
1994 -<BR>
Designers: Bill Stumpf and Dan Chadwick
</B><P>
It doesn't look like any chair you've ever seen. It doesn't 
feel like any chair you've ever sat in. Right away you notice 
how the Aeron chair's Kinemat tilt lets the seat and back 
move in easy harmony. Your natural body motions and 
work postures from forward-sitting to lounging, are 
healthfully supported. Replacing foam and fabric, the 
highly permeable Pellicle suspension helps keep you cool 
as it holds you comfortably. the Aeron chair comes in three 
sizes so it fits just about everyone. And simple adjustments 
make it work for just about everyone  in the office den or 
anywhere at home.

Through advanced ergonomic design, the Aeron chair sets 
a new standard for comfortable, healthful sifting. Quite 
simply, it does what office seating has never before done. <P>
<center><IMG border=0 SRC="3guys.jpg"></a></center><BR>
<center>Whatever the task, the Aeron chair provides comfort and 
support.</center> <P>
<B>KINEMAT TILT </B><P>
The Aeron chair's unique Kinemat tilt mechanism allows 
the body to naturally and simultaneously pivot at the 
ankles, knees, and hips. The backrest and seat pan move in 
proper relation for correct lumbar support in all seated 
positions. This lets the chair spontaneously support the 
posture a person prefers, from work-intensive forward 
through reclining-whether the user is in motion or at rest. 
<P> 
<B>PELLICLE SUSPENSION </B><P>
The Pellicle suspension provides healthful support in all 
sitting postures, as the patented Pellicle material equitably 
distributes body weight on the seat and back. It prevents 
the "bottoming out" common with many foam seat pads, 
which causes increased pressure on the buttocks and thighs. 
The material is also durable and easy to clean.

<UL><UL><B>SIZED TO FIT</B><P>
<UL><UL><UL>
 Office chairs are traditionally designed to accommodate an 
average sized person. Such chairs comfortably fit only 50-
60 percent of today's user population. Stumpf and 
Chadwick designed three sizes of Aeron chairs-small (A), 
medium (B), and large (C) - all with identical performance 
capabilities. The three chair sizes, combined with their 
active adjustments, let the Aeron chair fit virtually anyone 
in a broader range of the anthroprometric scale, from the 1st 
percentile female to the 99th percentile male. 
<P></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>


<UL><UL><B>A TAILORED FIT </B><P>
<UL><UL><UL>
The active adjustment controls are easy to find and operate 
from a seated position; icons clearly indicate functions. 
<UL><LI>	Most other chairs lower to just a 16-inch seat height, 
which is too high for 35-40 percent of the female 
population. With its two-stage pneumatic lift, the Aeron 
chair is far more inclusive. The A-size chair seat height 
adjusts from 14 3/8 inches to 19 1/2 inches; on the B- and 
C- size chairs, from 15 inches to 20 7/8 inches. 
<LI>	The tilt tension adjustment lets the user control the 
resistance felt while leaning back. 
<LI>	The forward tilt adjustment positions the chair 5 
degrees forward. 
<LI>	The tilt limiter allows the user to control the tilt range 
without being locked in a single position. 
<LI>	Armrests can be independently adjusted vertically and 
laterally for proper arm alignment with the task. 
<LI>	The lumbar pad can be adjusted vertically through a 4 
1/2-inch height range; its depth can be set at 3/4 inch or 1 
1/4 inches. </UL>
<P></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>

<UL><UL><B>OTHER FEATURES </B><P>
<UL><UL><UL>
<UL>
<LI>	The chair meets or exceeds major international 
standards. 
<LI>	The back is high and broad to provide optimum 
comfort and support.  
<LI>	The Pellicle suspension comes in 12 colors. 
<LI>	Two textured base and frame colors are available. 
<LI>	The chair will be available with select fabrics or 
leather soft pads for the seat and back. 
<LI>	Side chairs will be ready for order in the fall of 1996. 
</UL>
<P></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL>
<P>
<UL><UL><B>EARTH FRIENDLY </B><P>
<UL><UL><UL>
Herman Miller builds the Aeron chair responsibly, 
conscious of its environmental impact. Many Aeron chair 
parts are made of recycled material-for example, the base is 
recycled aluminum, and the frame is recycled polymer. The 
chair's long-term durability keeps it in use and out of the 
waste stream for a longer time. And, should a chair 
component need to be replaced, it can be changed in the 
field.

        <p>Every month, over 100 new viruses damage data and 
        productivity. These viruses are unintentionally received 
        through disks, bulletin boards, E-mail, the internet and 
        networks. Why have millions chosen McAfee VirusScan for 
        their security? Virus detection, removal and support 
        services.</p> 
        <p>According to IDC, in 1994, McAfee shipped more 
        standalone DOS, Windows and OS/2 anti-virus software 
        worldwide than any other company with 68% of the 
        &quot;unit&quot; sales. Millions of individual and 
        corporate VirusScan customers and agents in over 65 countries 
        enable us to analyze more viruses first and demand us to 
        resolve incidents fast. This tremendous installed user 
        base and exhaustive testing, including monthly VSUM virus 
        library certifications, provide McAfee with hundreds of 
        samples per month.</p> 
        <p>Consistent virus detection and removal requires a 
        sizable staff of skilled and experienced virus 
        researchers, engineers and support teams. We are 
        constantly expanding our capabilities; recruiting expert 
        virus researchers, streamlining support mechanisms and designing 
        ground breaking virus extrapolation tools. This customer-driven 
        effort delivers significant monthly updates and the best reviews 
        in the industry</p>

THE GALAXY ART COLLECTION<P>

THE FIRST-EVER ON-BOARD COLLECTION<BR>
 OF EMERGING CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS</H2>

	<H5><I>New York (June 23, 1996) </I></H5>
</center>	
	<P><DD>Celebrity Cruises, one of the world's foremost cruise lines, is 
pleased to announce the formation of the GALAXY ART 
COLLECTION, an unprecedented collection of avant-garde art. 
	<P><DD>
	The GALAXY ART COLLECTION is being established for 
permanent installation on board the cruise ship GALAXY, the 
newest vessel in Celebrity's five-star fleet to be launched 
December 1996. 
<P><DD>
	The GALAXY COLLECTION follows Celebrity's highly 
acclaimed collection of contemporary masters on-board the cruise 
ship Century which, since its December 1995 launch, has been 
met with enormous enthusiasm. 
<P><DD>
	The GALAXY ART COLLECTION is comprised of more 
than 250 works of art by both emerging and established artists 
from the late 80s and 90s.<BR><DD>
	" The Collection reflects the pluralism and diversity that 
define the international contemporary art world today". Current 
trends represented in the GALAXY COLLECTION include video 
art, conceptual art, abstract painting, art with a concern for body, 
conceptual art, and sculptural/installation works. 
<P><DD>
	The Collection will be installed on the interior decks of the 
cruise ship making the GALAXY virtually a museum of 
contemporary art at sea.
<UL><UL><UL><LI>
	 A highlight of the GALAXY COLLECTION is<B> Tony 
Oursler's Fire</B> (1996), the compelling color video image of an 
eyeball that is projected onto a large, hollow, white-painted 
fiberglass globe with accompanying sound tracks, which was 
featured on the June cover of Art in America. <P>

	<LI> The collaborative artists <B>Peter Fischli</B> & <B>David Weiss</B>, 
whose work is currently featured at the Walker Art Center, are 
strongly represented by prototypical, whimsical photography from 
the mid-1980s. 
<P>
	<LI> Representing today's diverse group of abstract painters is 
<B>Philip Taaffe</B> whose ceremonial paintings utilize the repetition of 
loosely geometric shapes creating poetic patterns of black, color 
and light. 
<P>
	<LI><B> Marina Abramovic</B>'s wall-mounted crystal pillows (1994) 
have been selected as examples of conceptual art with a concern 
for the body.  Abramovic's pillows are incomplete until the viewer 
occupies them in becoming part of the work by pressing his/her 
forehead into the crystal to receive its vibrations. 
<P>
	<LI><B> Stephan Balkenhol</B>'s celebrated rough-hewn painted wood 
sculpture represents a return to the figure with a humorous yet 
philosophical edge. 
<P>
	<LI><B> Jack Pierson</B>'s thought provoking sculptures That's Life and 
Miracles (1995), words formed from found signage mounted on 
the wall parable doomed glamour of the late 20th century. 

<P>	<LI>The Collection will also include examples of works from 
the late 80's and 90's by well-established artists such as <B>Robert 
Rauschenberg</B> and <B>Jasper Johns</B>, which serve as a point of 
reference for the works of younger artists. 
</UL></UL></UL>
<P><DD>
	The GALAXY ART COLLECTION, which is nearly 
complete, is being assembled by <B>Christina Chandris</B>, Celebrity 
Cruises's curator and fine art advisor, in collaboration with<B> Tom 
Cugliani</B> and <B>Tara K. Reddi</B> both directors of Marlborough Gallery 
in New York.
<P><DD>
	 In the early 1980s Christina Chandris and her husband<B> John 
Chandris</B>, Chairman of Celebrity Cruises, began building their 
own art collection, focusing on the Abstract Expressionists; the 
English School, including Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach and R.B. 
Kitaj; as well as early works by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper 
Johns. 
<P><DD>
	Christina Chandris began collecting for the cruise line in 
1990, choosing works for Celebrity's first three ships, Horizon, 
Meridian and Zenith. 
<P><DD>
	With Celebrity's new trilogy of ships Century (1995), 
GALAXY (1996) and Mercury (1997), Mrs. Chandris envisioned 
museum quality art collections each focusing on a different theme. 
In order to realize this concept, she approached Tara Reddi, 
Director of Marlborough Graphics, and invited her to collaborate 
on the creation of the collections.
<P><DD>
	 Ms. Reddi brings to the project more than fifteen years of 
expertise in modern and contemporary prints and multiples from 
The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and from the Print 
Department of Sotheby's in New York. She joined Marlborough 
Graphics in 1992 as director. 
<P><DD>
	Works by emerging artists are being selected with the 
counsel of Tom Cugliani who, from 1987 to 1994, had his own 
gallery in New York which featured emerging American and 
European artists. Mr. Cugliani joined Marlborough in 1994 as 
director.
<P><DD>
	The choice of emerging artists as the focus of the GALAXY 
COLLECTION, states Chandris, is relevant as a continuation of 
the contemporary masters exhibited on-board the Century. "We 
have introduced a variety of trends and a diversity of mediums in 
order to create the true experience of an up-to-date museum 
collection". "The point of difference with our ship-board 
collection, is that passengers have the exceptional opportunity to 
live with cutting-edge works, allowing them to develop a personal 
response to the Collection". 
<P><DD>
	The GALAXY is the second in a trilogy of ships designed as 
museums at sea. The first ship, Century, houses the M.V. Century 
Art Collection, which presents an extensive survey of the 
important developments in art since the 1960Õs. The third ship, 
Mercury, is scheduled for launch in 1997 and will also become 
home to a collection of art with a different theme and focus.

<center><H1> Anguilla The Smiling Island</H1>
<I>By :  Joan B. Hays </I><BR></center>

<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="carn1.jpg" alt=" Photo - Native girl"></center>


<DD>In August 1994 Keith and I took our friend Megan on her first trip to the West Indies.  We chose what has become a hot destination for the traveler who wants the romance of an Island vacation without the plastic of intensive mass tourism development.  We 
booked our trip to Anguilla to co-incide with the opening of the Anguilla's week long Carnival on the first Monday in August, the traditional "August Monday" bank holiday.  It was our second visit to this hard to get to island and the visit lived up to our memories and expectations.  We were delighted, especially since we were introducing a friend to the island on her first trip to the West Indies.<P>

<DD>On our first visit to Anguilla we split our stay between Cap Julica, a secluded and exclusive resort looking out across the Caribbean to St. Martin, and The Mariners Inn, a more relaxed and casual hostelry on the North side of the Island at Sandy Ground. This time we took a two bedroom apartment in Pelican Villas on the beach where the action is at Carnival. <P> 

<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="sndygrnd.jpg" alt=" Photo - Nice view"></center><BR>


<DD>Anguilla has a well developed tourist industry but not one that caters to the big hotels and mass migrations of sun-birds turning red under an unfamiliar tropic sun.  Smaller hotels and inns as well as private homes and apartments in the many condo developments along the sea side furnish the visitor with a wide range of accomodations ranging from several hundred dollars per night for the exclusive and all inclusive resorts to much more reasonable vacation rentals in private facilities.<P>
Much of the reason for the limited scope of the well planned tourism of Anguilla is the difficulty in getting there.  Travelers reaching Anguilla by air must arrive in small commuter planes from San Juan, St. Thomas or the short ten minute hop from St. Ma
artin's Princess Juliana Airport.  Many visitors arrive by small and fast ferry from Marigot, the Capitol of St. Martin - the French side of the shared island - after a taxi ride from the airport located on the Dutch side.  Either way you choose, getting 
to Anguilla is not as easy as climbing on a plane at home and pouring off a jumbo jet at the island.  That isolation limits the number of tourists and helps give Anguilla its relaxed atmosphere.<P>

<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="shoalbay.jpg" alt=" Photo - Nice view"></center><BR>

<DD>We got to the island late in the evening after a long day traveling.  It was after 10 P.M. when the taxi pulled up to the door of the villa.  The key was hidden where our hostess told us it would be and after choosing our bedrooms we collapsed until morning.  When morning came it was time to do a bit of grocery shopping.  There is a small store in Sandy Ground within an easy 5 minute walk from the apartment but we wanted to pickup the more substantial offerings of the Vista grocery about a 1/2 mile inland from Sandy Ground.  We decided to walk. <P> 

<DD>About half way there we discovered what we had forgotten when the three of us started out - though Anguilla is one of the rare non-mountainous islands in the Caribbean, the Vista sits on the top of a 160 foot bluff and the road up which we walked was steep indeed.  We paused to rest in the shade of a mahogany tree.  As we caught our breath, we were joined by a local gentleman pushing a bicycle.  He asked our permission to join us in our sanctuary of shade.  After we all felt fit enough to resume our climb, the fellow walked the rest of the way to the top of the bluff with us and, waving goodbye, remounted his two wheeler to peddle into The Valley, Anguilla's administrative and commercial center. <P> 

<DD>The Vista stocks a complete line of basic groceries and a good offering of gourmet cheeses, some frozen foods and meats and a well chosen offering of wines and liquors.  We bought enough to get us through the next couple of days and started the long trek back with two bags of groceries apiece.  That experience brought us to the realization that we really needed to rent a car.  I'm a travel agent and I should have known better but some how I let my husband convince me that we wouldn't be leaving Sandy Ground and renting a car was a waste.   We rented a car as soon as we got back to the apartment.  After carrying groceries a half a mile in the late morning tropic sun, I didn't hear a word from Keith about the cost!<P>
The next day we picked up the car and drove Megan on a tour around the 24 mile long, sand spit narrow island stopping at every beach and hotel development so that I could eyeball it and get impressions to help me guide my clients.  Keith suprised me with a  stop at Island Harbour for lunch at Scilly Cay (That is how the Brits spell Key].  We had packed our bathing suits along for an inviting beach and Keith knows how to pick the best beach.<P>  

<DD>Scilly Cay is a tiny islet in the middle of the the bay just big enough for the restaurant  Keith chose for lunch.  Just stand on the floating dock and wait a minute or two and the Scilly Cay launch comes up to ferry you to the island.  It is best to be in your swim suit before you go.  Landing on the cay means jumping into a foot or two of water.  Keith ordered three lobster lunches for one oclock at the bar, got Megan and I each a rum punch and brought them to us as we sprawled on the white powder beach
 soaking up the sun.   What a delightful way to wait for service. <P>

<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="carn2.jpg" alt=" Photo"></center><BR>

<DD>All year long the Anguillans wait and get ready for Carnival.  The week long festival is not pitched to the tourists and, in fact, is scheduled for the off season.  It is an island wide party at which vistors are made quite welcome, but it is really an Anguillan local affair.  Sailing is to Anguilla what cricket is to the rest of the British West Indies and baseball is to the United States.  The highlight of Carnival is the series of sailboat races to crown the year's champion crew.<p>

<DD> All year long crews from every hamlet and crossroads on the island work building new boats and getting these traditional fishing vessels ready for the 
big race.  The boats are lined up along Sandy Ground Beach, anchored to the sand with their sails raised.  At the starting signal the crews push off, leap aboard and sail out and around Sandy Isle, a dot 5 miles off shore then back to the starting point w
here the winner is the first crew to touch the flag on the finish bouy. <P>

<center><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="race2.jpg" alt=" Photo - Boats "></center><BR>

<DD>In the old days the winning crew had to return the flag to the race committee at the Coast Guard station.  Since there are no rules in an Anguillan boat race, a lot of the action took place on the beach and the crew that reached the sand with the flag might not be declared the winner if they could not retain it between the tide line and the race committee.  Things changed before the action got out of hand.<P>
From mid morning until late into the night the beach at Sandy Ground is jumping at Carnival.  Every organization on the island is raising money by selling food or spirits or conducting games of chance from booths set up on the  beach.  The smells of chicken and pork barbeque waft down the beach.  Lobster and prawn peek out of covered charcoal cookers. <P> 

<DD>The several restaurants lining the beach don't seem to mind the competition, most of them hire live bands to entertain the crowd and the tables all seem to be full.  Johno's at the east end of the beach is the favorite watering hole for the sailors in the
anchorage tucked up under the bluffs at the southeast corner of the bay.  Bareboats from the several charter firms over in St. Martin, crewed charters and Carribean cruising live-aboards all converge on Sandy Ground for the races.  The dance floor at Johno's is full and the revelry spills onto the beach. <P>
At the other end of the beach and the culinary range is the Barrel Stay an internationally renowned eatery for continental cuisine spiced with an island flair.  Next door is the Riviera with a similar and just slightly less pricey menu.  Half way between the Riviera and Johno's on the beach and in price and menu offering is the Tropical Penguin where we made our headquarters during an afternoon of race watching.<P>
Ripples is situated off the beach, just behind the Riviera and offers West Indian flavors and traditional dishes focused on the sea food offerings of the not yet fished out reefs surrounding Anguilla.  We had just been seated for dinner when our friend with the bicycle who had shared the shade on our trek to the Vista came in.  He stopped by the table to ask how we were enjoying our stay.  We invited him to join us as he explained that his sister owned Ripples and that, since she was "off island" he had agreed to look in on the operation in her absence.  It turned out that he was Assistant Commisioner of Police. <P> 

<DD>When he learned that Megan and Keith were lawyers he asked the inevitable question. <I>What do you think about O.J.</I> ?.  CNN covers the world!  That launched a long conversation comparing the British and American courts and the differences in press coverage of court business;  the benefits and detrements that the development of cable TV had brought to the island; the problems that tourism creates for the local authorities and the state of the world in general and teenagers in particular a subject that both he and Keith dealt with eloquently and with great commiseration.<P>

<DD>That dinner conversation typified the different feeling that I got on Anguilla.  In thirty years of wandering the West Indies on vacations and travel agent fam trips I have visited almost every island.  From 1965, when I first set foot on St Thomas, I've felt at home in the West Indies.  I try to make it an annual pilgrimage.  But until we found Anguilla I don't think I felt as welcome.  I tried to figure out the difference.  It was not until we got back to our small town in rural Central Illinois that I figured out the difference.  Anguilla is not an emerging third world country.  It is a thoroughly middle class island with a small town flavor.  There are no slums and there are no "great houses".  Yes, there are exclusive subdivisions and condo developments.  Yes, there are a house or two in which I can't imagine living - just as there are in our basically middle American home town.  That is what made the difference.  I did not just feel welcome, I felt at ease, like I was home.<P>

Another beautiful island...
Subject: ANTIGUA-->
<DD>

Nearly everyone arrives by air or cruise liner. The islands of Antigua  and
 Barbuda are located in the  Leeward Islands, right in the heart of the
Caribbean.Antigua stands out as a special gem in a chain of fantasy islands
strung like pearls down the Eastern Caribbean coast.
Antigua is ringed with white sand beaches, coral reefs, verdant  shores and
low range mountains.
Its' temperature is comfortable, cooled by constant trade winds. Every effort
is made by the islanders to make your stay a memorable one. I assure you. St.
John's being the capital of Antigua, will make you feel welcome, day or
night.
<P><DD>
Outside the custom areas is a booth, where you can rent a car for touring the
island at your own pace. It's very easy to find transportation on the spot,
but if you are one of those people who prefer to arrange  it ahead ,do so!  I
f your time is limited, I would suggest that you take a taxi. The driver will
take you on a tour of the main attractions. A full day's tour, will cost
approximately $40.00-$50.00 a day. Be sure to know and remember whether the
price is in U.S . DOLLARS or  EASTERN CARIBBEAN DOLLARS. 
US$ 1.00=E.C.$2.70
Car Rentals are about $40.00 to $50.00 a day.  I f you wish to rent a car for
a week,your cost will be approximately $150 .00 to $175 .00 U .S. dollars  .

<P><DD>

There are so many wonderful places to explore in Antigua. I am going to give you a list of some of these delightful places to visit :

<UL><LI>    Museum of Antigua/Barbuda <BR>
Provides a great  historical background  from 10,00 years ago. Find 


out how the island was  formed and who lived there. Learn about the Arawaks and the Caribs as well as their culture.This museum is full of interesting displays. Plan on spending  an hour or two.

<LI>  Betty's Hope<BR>

Built in 1674 by Sir Christopher Codrington was the site of one of the first full scale sugar plantations on Antigua. It is now, one of the most beautiful attractions on the island. I recommend it highly. Every taxi driver on the island will take you there. Don't miss it !

<LI>Fig Tree Drive<BR>

One of the most beautiful drives on the island. I need to explain that "FIG"
is the Antiguan name for bananas.( if it sounds confusing, don't feel bad I
got confused too...) 
When you  take this drive,  have a camera and plenty of extra film. The road
is lined with tropical fruit trees, such as : mangoes, oranges coconuts,
guavas , bananas and pineapples. I can only describe these marvelous sights
as a Garden of Eden...


      <LI>      Sugar Mills
<BR>
          You will notice a lot of these sugar mills. Mostly in ruins, but some with the outer structures still intact. In 1705  the island  of Antigua
 was planted with sugar cane. It was a great industry at that  time and  170 sugar cane mills were built for commerce. If you are a photography enthusiast, these sugar mills  are great subjects.
</UL>
<P><DD>
There are so many places to visit, wether you drive or walk, keep an open mind and do what you like to do...
<P><DD>
When it comes to shopping, you have come to the right place. Antigua is a delight for shoppers. The newest and most exciting development is called Heritage Quay.If you are a cruise  or yacht passenger,  it's very easy for you to just step onto the pier and simply walk into the wide and spacious area of Heritage Quay, where you will find a wide variety of goods available . You can shop for the finest quality items from Europe, North and South America and the Caribbean.You can even  find the finest Swiss watches at
 :Little Switzerland.
All merchandise is Duty Free...

<P><DD>

 St. John's , is not only charming , but totally fascinating. I for one, am
  ready to return...
<P><DaD>
You must not miss Redcliffe Quay ,which was once used as a slave compound, called a "barracoon.  In 1834, slavery was abolished. " These buildings are housing merchants with fine wares. Exquisite dining and entertainment abounds. The islanders have retained most of the traditional architecture
 during the restoration of the area.
<P><DD>
One more thing to mention:  Antigua is  famous for its' sailing. There are many day cruises to choose from. The weather conditions are idyllic, with warm temperatures cooled by gentle, constant breezes. I would like to suggest one day trip in particular, for those of you with the spirit of long ago adventures :
<P><DD>
The Jolly Roger Pirate cruise, a spacious, two masted schooner, will take you back to pirate days( without the fighting...) It has lots of room for relaxation, exotic dining and dancing.Your spirit will soar with the calypso rhythm of the music, and incidentally, the barrel of rum is never empty....
<P><DD>
For those of you with romance in your heart,  there are lots of night cruise to choose from. Romance under the Caribbean stars, is guaranteed...
<P><DD>

A lot more could be said about this exciting and  beautiful island. If you run out of time, Antigua will receive you with open arms.Again and again..
<P>

Incidentally,it's duty FREE!

A palm-fringed beach .Barbados
Illustration by Maryvonne C.M.MARTIN Your stay would  be incomplete without trying the local food in BRIDGETOWN, capital of Barbados. To tempt your tastebuds, a delicious fare of Bajan food awaits you.Be different, explore new tastes ! How about:Bajan style flying fish,succulent blackened chicken served with coconut mayonnaise, bread-fruit cheesy or breadfruit pie,baked plantain,mango mousse or rum omelet flambe..Too many dishes to mention 
<P><DD>
              My favorite place is the   FISHERMAN'S WHARF SEAFOOD RESTAURANT. The view of the harbor is truly delightful. Not only do you enjoy some of the best cuisine around but, you are entertained by various boat activities as well as local color. This particular restaurant is renowned for its' traditional West Indian dishes, which includes :broiled caribbean lobster and crab backs.It's definitely a must ,to visit this charming and quaint restaurant.
<P><DD>
The Barbadians are also reputed for exotic drinks, such as :Bajan coffee,which is strong coffee laced with Mount Gay rum and fresh cream, Mango Daiquiris and passion fruit drinks.
<P><DD>
The Barbadians are fun loving people.
It's not unusual to see natives doing the Limbo act to the accompaniment of
a steel band; Usually you will see this sight close to the ship's terminal.
Not only is it captivating to watch but entertaining as well. The dancers
gracefully lower themselves under a bar
(lowered at intervals) making the high energy act seem so simple and
painless.
<P><DD>
You will be able to listen to a wide variety of Caribbean music (steel bands,) indoors and outdoors.HOT1HOT!
HOT!
<P><DD>
If you find that time was too short to complete all that you wanted to do and see, there is only one remedy :come again and continue where you left off...
<P><DD>
The beautiful island of Barbados will stay in your heart forever.

<H1>A Cruise to Martinique</H1>
<p>
<I>By :  Maryvonne C.M.Martin </I><BR>
1996<BR>mmartin181@aol.com<P>
</CENTER>

Begin <I>at</I> SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico<P>

<DD>
When we arrived at the airport,we were immediately greeted by the ship's personnel who transported us to our cruise ship, standing majestically in the harbor.
<P><DD>
After being processed at the ship's terminal, we were shown to our spacious cabin where we gratefully fell asleep...We were exhausted after a long flight from California. Later that  evening, we got up refreshed and readied ourselves for dinner on board.
<P><DD>
I need to mention that if you want to be pampered, surrounded by sheer opulence, this is IT!. The interior of the ship is truly magnificent. It's personnel is comprised of diverse nationalities, impeccably dressed and ready to take care of your every  (reasonable) wish.
<P><DD>
<B>The next morning</B>, we arrived in Fort De France, capital of Martinique. Standing on the floor of the thirteenth deck,I watched the island come through the early light of dawn, and felt like I was entering another world of ancient time.
<P><DD>

<!----2>
The ship glided silently and effortlessly through the bay, past the guarding stone walls of the old fort surrounded by volcanic mountains, lush with tropical greenery, their sharp peaks lost in morning clouds.
<P><DD>
I was totally engulfed by it's sheer beauty. This must be Paradise...
By the way, , Martinique is part of the windwards islands group in the
Caribbeans. French, of course, is the official language, but English is
spoken widely, especially in tourists' centers.
You don't need to worry about currency, as the islanders will gratefully take
your Francs, Dollars or credit cards.One U.S. Dollar equal about 5.3 Francs.
<P><DD>
Well, now it's time for us to leave the ship. We are going on a prearranged
tour of the island, in an air conditioned Mercedes (Thank God!)  Also, many
taxis are 
available, waiting for passengers to disembark. They will take you anywhere
on the island.
<P><DD>
We paid $ 72.00 per couple, for a three and an half hour tour.I t's not bad considering that gasoline is about $4.20 to $4.50 per gallon. If you want to rough it, you can take the local bus, at your own risk...for about 15 Francs....
<P><DD>
When our pleasant and loquacious driver found out that I spoke fluent 
<P><DD>

<!--3-->

French, his English totally disappeared. He maneuvered adroitly through the
narrow  and congested streets of Fort De France, where you can find almost
anything. You can shop for fine jewelry, gold and precious stones, crystal,
perfumes of all kinds, and more, much more...
If you prefer, you can take the ferry across the bay to other shops and beach
front resorts, such as Le Club Med and Le Meridien.
<P><DD>
As we went through the bustling town, I noticed tropical fruit and vegetable stalls of all kind. Fruit like the Anananas du pauvre ( poor man's pineapple,) fresh cocoanuts, many varieties of bananas, fruit a pain (breadfruit,)and raisinier bord de mer , which is a sea grape. (very sweet) Much too many to mention...
<P><DD>
The hillsides are studded with houses of vibrant colors, as lush as everything else on the island: pinks, purples, greens, yellows, all surrounded by  luxuriant greenery and blooms of  unimaginable brilliance
<P><DD>
We took the road north to St. Pierre, which was totally destroyed in 1902,when the volcano, Mt. Pelee, erupted killing thirty thousand people.It's the most notorious volcano in the Caribbeans.
<P><DD>

<!--4-->

Our driver drove as if the road belonged to him only, absolutely and seemingly unaware of other vehicles that might be approaching us around the treacherous bends.He simply announced his arrival on the twisty road ,by leaning on the horn... I must admit that we were sitting on the edge of the seat for the greatest part of the trip! Besides that fact, we were in for a special treat.
<P><DD>
Our driver took us to one of his friend's private gardens. He made a sharp right turn unto  an overgrown, rutted path, to a level spot where he turned the car around with some difficulty, and let us out.
<P><DD>
An unimaginable sight greeted us: Rows of Anthuriums of all colors, Allamandas Cathartica, Golden trumpets, Heliconias, flourished everywhere, not to mention plants and flowers that I had never seen before now.
<P><DD>
We  "courageously" got back in the car and drove to several banana plantations and sugar cane fields.We stopped at a fruit stand to buy some of the sweetest , bananas that you ever want to taste....
<P><DD>
We went on and admired the rain forest, with tree size ferns, tall mahogany
trees and a myriad of lush vines and trailing blossoms.
As we drove around a bend, Mt.Pelee came into view, it's sharp peaks crowned
by dark, billowy clouds.An awesome sight that one can never forget...
<P><DD>
<!--5-->

We continued on and finally arrived in the town of St. Pierre, where the eruption took place, in 1902.What a calamity! Only one survivor; a prisoner kept in a stone cell and buried in ashes.
<P><DD>
You must visit the Museum,which displays historical photographs and artifacts as a reminder of Mt. Pelee's tragedy.Shattered plates and cups, melted cutlery, and the church's melted cross, are  grim reminders of destruction. After the eruption, St. Pierre tried to rebuild on the old foundations, but it can never be as it once were, the capital of Martinique.
<P><DD>
Just below the museum, you can access a beach of pure white sand , fringed by a clear jade ocean, with palm trees leaning precariously while two native children run back and forth in the warm surf...
<P><DD>
That colorful sight reminded me of the French artist, Gauguin. It must have been the same people and the same landscape  that he saw, when he first came to the island...Martinique inspired him with it's color and innocence. 
<P><DD>
In Carbet, you can visit  the Gauguin museum, and the house where he resided.
<P><DD>
We reluctantly left St.Pierre and returned "unscathed" to Fort De France and to our cruise ship.
<P><DD>

<!--6-->

That same night, we left Martinique for another island :Barbados. But, that's another story....
<P>

<H3 ALIGN=left><A NAME="title1">1. GETTING THERE:</A></H3><BR>
 <TAB ID=t1 INDENT=10>The charter flights out of Toronto and Montreal have to be the
cheapest long distance flights in the world!  Our Royal Airlines
charter flight out of Toronto, flight only, and with taxes it was
$455.00Cdn (i.e. about $335US). <BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1> For comparison I tried finding the cheapest fare through
EAASY-SABRE, which was about $650US, involving a stopover in Miami.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The charter flights land first in Barcelona (a twin city to
Puerto La Cruz), then drop into Margarita Island as they head back
to Toronto.  The point of telling you this is that it can therefore
be quite a grueling all-day trip, especially in a flying-sardine-
can like an Airbus 320.  An hour late, our plane got away at about
9:30a and arrived at Margarita about 5:30p local time, only an hour
before sundown.  The time zone is one hour east of Eastern Standard
so the first day's sundown comes a bit early, the homecoming gives
you back the hour.<BR>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=left><A NAME="title2">2. MONEY MATTERS:</a></H3>

<H4 ALIGN=left>(a) Exchange rates/banking</H4>

<TAB ID=t1>It took Jeannelle longer than me to adapt to the money, which
is complicated by the fact that there is a thriving currency black
market.  This was helpful to me, as explained below.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>As at January, 1996 the Venezuelan Bolivar (called "B's" by us
tourists) traded at banks/money exchanges at the rate of about 185-
190 Bs for $1 Cdn, and 290-295 Bs for $1 US.  CANADIANS BEWARE: the
arithmetic works out that you are well-advised to get $US in Canada
before leaving -- otherwise, one Canadian dollar buys about $.64US
worth of Bolivars.  This is in contrast to, say, Mexico, where it
isn't worth paying for two exchange transactions. <BR> 
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1> The black market further exaggerates the difference between
the two dollars.  Canadian dollars are not generally sought on the
black market, but an American dollar in cash could fetch from 340
to 360 Bolivars, and $US Traveller's Cheques would get the lower of
that range.  Where in the body of this message I have inserted U.S.
dollar equivalents, I use the black market rate of 340 Bs--but
please do not expect an official hotel price at that rate in U.S.
dollars.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1> Once I caught on, I was able to use my arcane currency-
calculating skills to advantage.  When I did not want Jeannelle to
spend money, I'd quote $Cdn exchange, rounding it up: an 18,000 Bs
necklace  works out to a big $100Cdn if you see $1Cdn buying "less
than 200 Bs".  When I wanted something, to emphasize how cheap it
was, I shifted gears to $US.  The jeep we rented for a day, for
example, was ONLY $US50 or so, when you considered that 18,000 Bs
at the rate of 350 Bs per dollar came to somewhere between $45
(i.e. 400 Bs per dollar) and $60 (300 Bs per dollar).  The little
things count!<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Bank machines: both Porlamar and Puerto La Cruz had a few ATM
machines that would access your home accounts, giving you Bolivars
at the official exchange rate.  Like here, though, the damn things
always seemed to go out of service at the very moment you needed
them most, and the maximum I was able to extract at one time
was 20,000 Bs.  It was the Union Bank in both places that carried
the most varied list of available services, such as Cirrus, Plus
System, and Visa.  Other banks had only American Express, and a
(European one?) with a name like "Suiche".<BR>
<BR>
<H4 ALIGN=left>(b) the currency black market</H4>

<TAB ID=t1>I wish we had received before we left some advice regarding
the black market.  More than likely, people going to specific
resorts will get this advice in their orientation meetings.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>While you are walking the streets in tourist areas, you are
approached constantly by touts asking if you want to change money,
if you want "cambio".  I would like to suggest the following
guidelines, which we broke to our regret...<BR>
<BR>
<LI>1.   Only do the actual trade inside a shop.  We did not know
     it, but a lot of shop owners will exchange money without the
     intercession of a tout.  In any case, if the tout wants to
     make the exchange in the street, change your mind not your
     money.  The touts seem to get their money from a shop-keeper
     nearby, whence they also get their commission.  Let them take
     you to the shop interior to make the exchange, and they can
     still get their commission thereafter.  This routine is
     presumably safer, too, in case there are thieves (or police)
     around.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>2.   COUNT YOUR MONEY: there was invariably in our dealings an
     attempt to short-change us by a thousand or two, which quickly
     makes all this hassle less than worthwhile.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>3.   Do not change too much at a time:  $200 at a time seems
     to be a generous and reasonable amount. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>4.   Standard disclaimer:  it is a black market and therefore
     illegal.  We heard of no-one going to jail for changing money,
     but it is, presumably, possible.  The most important thing
     about its' being illegal is that if you are ripped off, you
     have no recourse.  Read on, if you want to see whence comes
     all this gratuitous advice.<BR> <BR> <TAB ID=t1>One fine day I accepted a young tout's promise to get me a rate of 345 Bs. We were led to an area under some trees, on the busy sidewalk along the tourist street "4 Mayo" in Porlamar.  Already I was getting uneasy, because there were many, perhaps 5, other young men who seemed to be standing around -- and to be privy to our deal.  I only really wanted to change $100US, but felt I'd better do $200US because it was travellers cheques.  We were made to wait, while some relaying of communication seemed to take place, the gist of which was that my TC's could only fetch 340 Bs after all.  Jeannelle decided to also change $125US cash, so I tried to use this as a bargaining tool to keep the price at 345 Bs for my TC's.  In the event, Jeannelle made her own deal, I made mine.  After an uneasy 5 minutes of waiting, one of the young men came up with a bundle of Bolivars for me, and another with a bundle for Jeannelle.  It was made out by gestures that we should put the money in our pockets, not make things too obvious.  I had signed my TC's and handed them over, but I did know enough to count the money, Jeannelle did the same.  My bundle was short by about 20,000 Bs (!), and Jeannelle was short by 3,000 Bs.  I handed the money back, and got back my TC's, all under the pretext that they were getting together the full amount from various sources, would need more time.  Jeannelle handed her bundle back to her fellow who wanted to confirm her alleged count, and thereafter she was given back a corrected bundle of money.  Just then things went rather tense, as the touts indicated in low voices that the two men near the wall were police, and told us to keep our money out of sight.  After another few minutes of standing around, I suggested we meet outside  another hotel area down the street to complete my transaction, and off we went.  So can you guess what really happened?  It's not hard to suppose that no-one showed up outside the hotel.  But in the 'excitement' the bundle returned to Jeannelle by the tout was short by an even greater amount, being 13,000 Bs ... a very handy commission for changing money worth 43,000 Bs.   We can only guess if the real police were there, or involved in this kind of scam.  Following the above guidelines would in any event have avoided this loss.  Of course, like for STD, the best advice of all is to "abstain".<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title3">3.  BASIC GEOGRAPHY:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>If you are planning to go there, you will of course take a
look at your atlas.  The north coast of Venezuela is wonderfully
warm even in the coldest January.  In the evening, the cool breeze
is still short-sleeve shirt weather, very pleasant.  The noon-day
sun is intense, and a sunburn from it is no joke.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The island is "mountainous", unlike, say, the Bahamas or
Cozumel.  We even visited a rather nice waterfall, Fuentiduenos.
One must, however, keep in mind that the climate is almost desert-
like, which is especially obvious out at the deserted western
peninsula called Macanao.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Porlamar at the southeast corner must have at least half of
the approximately 300,000 inhabitants of Margarita (this last
figure from the Net, as the published population of the state Nueva
Esparta).  Nested in the mountains in the middle is the capital of
Asuncion, no village either.  Across on the western side of the
main island is the beautiful peaceful city of Juangriego, probably
the same size as Asuncion.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The airport is on the southern coast of the main island.  The
half-hour taxi ride from the airport to downtown Porlamar was 2,000
Bs (=$7US).<BR>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title4">4.  HOTELS IN PORLAMAR:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>We arrived "air only", and because it was a late arrival, we
spent about 3 tense hours in a taxi going around to major hotels
looking for a reasonable room for a reasonable price.  Porlamar has
lots of good hotels.  Because it was early January, our rough goal
was to pay less that $50Cdn per night.  Bargaining  for prices at
several decent hotels like the Stauffer was not going well -- in
the circumstances it was obvious to them that we needed a hotel
soon.  The going rate seemed to be around 16,000 Bs ($50US or so). 
Finally, we hit the jackpot at the MARGARITA VILLAGE INTERNATIONAL
RESORT, where we found a very comfortable room for 12,000 Bs.
($35US). Although mainly an all-inclusive resort, this low-rise
settlement allowed for paying guests like us.  It was filled with
Germans, always a sign that there is good value. We stayed there 3
nights, before travelling to the mainland.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Our friends from the flight, Karyn and Dan, stayed at an all-
inclusive for the whole two weeks called VALUE CLUB RESORT, which
used to be called the Decameron.  The rooms, they said, were not
great, but the price was very cheap, and the cooks made a real
effort to keep the food interesting.  We inquired about their off-
the-street rates, and were told that the all-inclusive price would
be $50US per person per night.   The resort looked like a really
swinging, fun spot..maybe the free drinks had something to do with
that!<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>When we returned to Porlamar from the mainland for the last 5
days of our holiday, we went directly to LA PERLA, which had been
recommended by friends in Canada.  The room cost 14,668 Bs ($43US),
was big and clean, with good beds.  One disappointment was that the
pool was out of service for almost two days, and the hotel
generally had an air of being deserted.  The hotel building is as
good as any, we were surprised that no Canadian tour operators had
it in their 1995-96 brochures.  Probably its location far from any
beach and a good long walk to downtown were negative factors.  I
suspect in the busier season this hotel fills up.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>If money were no object and I had my choice of hotels that we
saw, I'd say the MARGARITA INTERNATIONAL RESORT (the newer, high-
rise part of the resort village we stayed at), and MARGARITA HILTON
would be at the top of the list.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>One taxi driver who spoke good English recommended as budget
hotels the MARIA LUIS and the KANARATA, the latter of which we saw
on our first night, and which looked OK (it was full then, so that
should say something).<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title5">5.  HOTELS IN PUERTO LA CRUZ:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>We spent five days on the mainland in Puerto La Cruz.  When we
arrived, we went directly to a hotel listed in Fodor's called
CARIBE MAR, at the west end of the seaside tourist drag.  It was a
decent budget hotel, the price 5,500 Bs ($16US).  We were 
uncomfortable, however, with the lumpy beds, the bedside lights
that didn't work, the giant cockroach I found basking on my wet
beach towel.  The only consolation was the excellent satellite TV
reception.  After a night, I asked for and was graciously given a
refund for the rest of the booked time, and we walked almost next
door to the towering RASIL HOTEL, where for 9,450 Bs ($28US) we had
a splendid room with decent beds. It is a fine hotel constructed
perhaps too ambitiously to include a small mall of shops.  This was
to us a wonderful bargain, which I doubt will be available in the
high season.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>From off-shore, the Puerto La Cruz skyline is framed by the
two better hotels, on the west by the high Rasil where we stayed,
and on the east the lower but longer HOTEL MELIA.  This last is the
most expensive in town, and where most Canadian tour operators send
folks.  We spoke to a Canadian couple who said the upstairs rooms
did not live up to the standard of the fancy lobby area...but
perhaps they expected too much.  We neglected to inquire for the
exact price of a room there.  If the bar prices were any
indication...expensive!<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Finally, out on the El Morro peninsula, the striking landmark
to the west of Puerto La Cruz, there is nested among the luxury
condominiums a gorgeous new luxury hotel the PUNTA PALMA.  The
guests there when we dropped over for a drink seemed to be mainly
French Canadian.  This is not surprising, since two of the large
condo buildings back on the beachward drive are wholly owned by
Montreal groups.  Hotel Punta Palma had a lovely pool, and even a
tolerable little constructed beach (El Morro is a promontory, no
natural beaches on it).  Again, if I had had the money, I think I
would have stayed at this resort.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>There are several other decent budget hotels in or near Puerto
La Cruz, but we are not aware of any other tourist class hotels.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title6">6.  BEACHES ON MARGARITA ISLAND:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>The best beach that we went to was PLAYA CARIBE on the
northwest coast, almost straight across the island from Porlamar. 
The sand is clean, and the waves are gigantic.  A taxi from
Porlamar to there was 2,500 Bs.  To return, we went to Juangriego
by taxi (400 Bs), and from there by local bus back to Porlamar (80
Bs each).  On the beach, you must rent a sun canopy if you intend
to spend any time there and not ruin your holiday with a sunburn;
this costs 800 Bs for the canopy and 2 chairs.  There are beach
restaurants, the most striking of which is the MOSQUITO COAST.  The
Canadian consul there (more later) Terry Bannon is a partner in
this clean well-run restaurant.  If it ever gets completed, the
stunning 90%-finished KOKOMAR RESORT just down the beach will be
one top holiday destination.  It is apparently a victim of
Venezuela's latest and ongoing banking crisis, and lies there
frustratingly unfinished, deserted.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The very long wavy beach at PLAYA EL AGUA on the northeast
coast was always considered the best, until Playa Caribe got
developed.  Again, this beach has surf.  There are numerous
pleasant-looking restaurants.  We spent our first beach day there. 
The taxi from Porlamar was 2,000 Bs, and we local bussed back for
about 60 Bs each.  The beach canopy and chairs here were only 500
Bs, maybe because we got there around noon.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1> If you want calm waters, there is a lovely beach between
Juangriego and Playa Caribe called PLAYA LA GALERA.  It was amazing
to see its absolutely placid waters on our way back from the
magnificent surf of Caribe, which is just around the other side of
a small mountain.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Finally, PLAYA EL YAQUE on the south side of the island past
the airport is apparently heaven for the windsurfers.  The water is
calm and shallow for far out, but there is always wind.  Wind
surfing enthusiasts know it from their magazines and by word of
mouth.  We enjoyed sitting under the palapas, taking the occasional
dip, and watching the armada of wind surfers out in the channel. 
There are again decent beach-side restaurants.  A taxi from
Porlamar cost 2,000 Bs to get there, but we were extorted 2,500 Bs
to get back..there is no local bus, unfortunately.  This different
beach culture was worth a visit.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The whole north coast is really fine beaches, and even in
Porlamar there are beaches in front of the downtown hotels like the
Bella Vista...if you like the idea of swimming in the bay into
which the city's incredibly stinking filthy disgraceful excuse for
a river empties.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title7">7.  BEACHES AT PUERTO LA CRUZ:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>Down the coast east of Puerto La Cruz there are several
commercial beaches: Arapito, Colorada, and Santa Cruz.  The road to
these beaches offers some spectacular vistas.  We came westward
along it after spending one night at Cumana...the latter, nothing
to write home about.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The best beaches, however, are on the islands off the coast
which seem all to be included in Mochima National Park.  It is a
simple matter to take a morning boat out to the three most popular
island beaches, Saco Beach and Puinare Beach on Chimana Island, and
Chimana Beach on another island.  There are at least three little
docks at the town beach right in front of Paseo Colon, and a return
ticket (keep the ticket!) is 800 Bs (about $2.50US).  Your boat, or
another with the same company, will return you about 4:00 p.m. 
Each island beach has a restaurant selling fresh fish and of course
cold beers, and there are chairs and shade huts to be rented for
about 500 Bs for two persons.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>To go to the more distant beaches, one can take a "tour" for
a day, for about 5,000 Bs (about $15US).  The tour will include
lunch, and you will stop at several of the nice beaches, and "La
Piscina", an area of clear water like a swimming pool, where you
can snorkel.  Our favorite beach was the last one on the tour,
Conoma Beach, which is actually on the mainland but supposedly
inaccessible by land.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title8">8.  RESTAURANTS IN PORLAMAR:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>We had no memorable meals here, but also no memorable disasters.  The predominant "foreign" food is overwhelmingly Italian.  One wonderful result of the Italian influence is the coffee, invariably made using a machine.  The 'cafe con leche grande' is a tasty cafe latte, for the price of a normal cup of coffee.  We encountered two American-style restaurants, the DUGOUT (sports bar) on 4 Mayo, and CHEERS on Santiago Marino, both serving expensive hamburgers and fries.  The MOSQUITO COAST down by the Bella Vista Hotel is apparently good, but we did not get to try it.  For some reason we missed having a meal or meals over at the recommended beach restaurants on Playa El Agua.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title9">9.  RESTAURANTS IN PUERTO LA CRUZ:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>The Paseo Colon has lots of attractive-looking restaurants. 
One of the most popular ones for tourists is the PARADOR at about
the middle of the strip.  It was expensive, but impressively clean,
with waiters who take pride in their job.  They make a production
of their Caesar salads created at your table side (2,900 Bs for
two), and practically everyone was ordering an interesting fish
platter that comes to the table looking like a heap of flaming
snow..which turns out to be rock salt encasing the fish. The waiter
chips away the salt, fillets for the customer the fish.  Our tab
for two decent meals and wine, with no dessert, came to 9,450 Bs
(about $28US).<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The best meal we had in Venezuela was at the little CHIC E
CHOC at the western end of the Paseo Colon.  This is a French style
restaurant nestled in a row of three (quite decent) Italian style
restaurants.  I fell in love with pargo (red snapper) on this
holiday, and the best pargo fillet I had was here, done in a light
cream sauce.  Part of the pleasure was the quiet but friendly
atmosphere.  We had a bill of about 6,000 Bs ($17US)...pricey
compared with the many medium-level restaurants, but far cheaper
than the Parador, or the hotel restaurants.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Of the three Italian restaurants in that little block by the
Chic e Choc, we preferred RESTAURANT DA LUIGI, which featured a
modest salad bar.  With glasses of Chilean wine, salad bar, and a
la carte meals, we had a bill of 3,500 Bs. ($11US).  Venezuelan
wine, by the way, seems to be AWFUL.  We had it twice, that was
enough.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title10">10.  CASINOS:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>The gambling bug has struck here.  In Porlamar, the biggest
nicest casino that we saw was right on Santiago Marino about half-
way between the Bella Vista and the 4 Mayo intersection.  At that
intersection itself is the Margarita Suites hotel, in which the
casino was large and pleasant-looking.  We were taken by a taxi
driver to a big one in the middle of nowhere called "Le Casino". 
Although large, it was seedy, and we were not at all pleased to be
significantly, and unapologetically short-changed by the girl who
cashes in the gambling chips.  I'd suggest you count them by
putting them back through a one-armed bandit, noting the count, and
THEN taking them to the cash-out.  Another nice and relatively busy
casino was at the Hilton out towards Pampatur.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Puerto La Cruz had several ambitious but empty gambling
emporiums.  The most comfortable one that we encountered was the
small casino attached to the Parador restaurant.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title11">11.  A PURSE-SNATCHING IN PORLAMAR:</a></H3>

<TAB ID=t1>We were walking past a dark empty lot on 4 Mayo when a nice-
looking young fellow asked Jeannelle for the time.  She managed to
say in Spanish "9:00", but feigning lack of understanding he had
the temerity to grab her watch arm to look at the watch directly. 
I kept walking for a second, then thought better of it, turned
around to see the fellow grab both ends of Jeannelle's purse and
with one tremendous yank, detach the purse from its straps.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>I chased the guy back through the lot, yelling loud "Hey's" to
get the attention of people in the lighted area on the back street
we were heading for, and especially a fellow on a motorcycle who
seemed to be right in the thief's path...who was, of course, his
accomplice.  Off they went.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>The municipal police arrived quickly and were as helpful as
they could be, driving us around the back streets asking the folks
out in their yards about the  getaway motorcycle.  Although they
seemed to be able to recreate the getaway path to a major road, we
were unsuccessful in finding by the roadside on that path what we
had hoped to find, namely, the purse emptied of money, but at least
containing Jeannelle's cards, and our passports/plane tickets.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Fortunately, this incident took place towards the end of our
holiday.  We had to waste a day recreating the tickets, obtaining
a police report, and other documentation.  The embassy in Caracas
put us in touch with the Canadian consul at Porlamar, Terry Bannon,
who was helpful above and beyond his duty.  The normal Venezuelan
folks like the restaurant owner who translated for us to the
police, the hotel manager who allowed us that night to move our
room (the room key was also on the purse), and some passers-by were
all sympathetic and as helpful as they could be.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Lesson(s)?  Use the hotel safe for valuables, and leave your
key at the desk.  Do be on guard for this, there is apparently a
lot of purse-snatching in the town, as we heard afterwards.  Use
those money belts.  <BR>


<H3 ALIGN=left><a name="title12">12.  PROBABLY USELESS MISCELLANEOUS TIPS</a>
</H3>
<TAB ID=t1>Get a Spanish phrase book before you go, and learn your way
around it, maybe on the long boring flight.  The Venezuelans are
not heavily into tourism, and relatively few speak or understand
English.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Put on your sunscreen in your room before heading for the
beach.  It takes 1/2 hour at least to form the right protective
layer.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Tip about 5% on top of the 10% service that will be charged on
the restaurant bills, if the service was satisfactory.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>You can bargain with taxi drivers, you do not have to accept
the 'tariff' rates they will show you.  Our friends got an
astounding deal with a taxi driver: 5,000 Bs for an entire day of
driving them around the island. <BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Buy a big bottle of water and a six-pack of Polar beers to
take to the beach (about 600 Bs altogether), instead of using the
restaurants there.  But do have a fresh fish dinner at the island
beaches.  I loved the "sierra" fillet, and the little "Corocoro"
fish deep-fried with garlic.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>Fellow Canadians: lose those stupid Maple Leaf pins etc.  The
Venezuelans are on to us: like we ourselves well know, we can be as
noisy, dumb, cheapskate, ugly, insensitive, and obnoxious as any
European Asian or American tourists can be...the flag won't give us
any extra goodwill or understanding here.<BR>
<BR>
<TAB ID=t1>As pre-trip, background reading for Margarita  Island, try
getting the excellent article posted on Internet by the Venezuelan
Embassy taken from a book El Dorado by -??.  It gives history, and
touristic attractions.  See "Margarita Island, the lost Paradise"
at:<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://venezuela.mit.edu/embassy/dorado/margrita.html">
         http://venezuela.mit.edu/embassy/dorado/margrita.html</A><BR>
<BR>     
<TAB ID=t1> If you take the ferry to Puerto La Cruz, make sure you get the
ticket line for "first class" tickets.  We were in a hurry, just
got in the shortest line-up for tickets, and inadvertently ended up
in second class: where we were literally locked into the second-
class area of the ferry!<BR>
<BR>

us email at "gmcconn@inforamp.net".

Subject: St. Marteen
Great Island!-->
<DD>
This beautiful  tropical island, is divided in two sections: Dutch and French. It makes for interesting differences in the culture and customs of each side. 
<P><DD>
New arrivals either come by sea or by air. If  you are on a cruise liner, you will  more than likely, anchor in Great Bay.If you arrive by air, you will land at Juliana airport.
<P><DD>
PHILIPSBURG,the bustling capital city of Dutch ST.Maarten, is renowned for
its' wide variety of duty free shopping, exquisite dining and  glittering
night life. You may want to visit the island Museum, rich in traditions and
exhibits of the island's past.
As far as currency is concerned, there is no need to worry. Dollars are
accepted everywhere:
Dutch side : Us. Dollars or Antillian gilders. ( one U.S.Dollar equals
approximately 1.8 N.A.F.)
French  side : U.S.Dollars or French Francs ( one U.S.Dollar equals
approximately six Francs)
 Dutch and French are the two official languages. However, English is widely spoken on both sides.

<P><DD>

Shopping in St.Maarten is a totally wondrous experience. I will give you a
 few examples of  its' diversity:
<UL><LI>LA ROMANA ,<BR> is a showcase for Italian  high fashion, including elegant beach
 clothing and designer sunglasses...LA ROMANA is located on both sides of the
island.<P>
<LI>ANGELIQUE European Jewelry:<BR>
This lovely shop displays a fine selection of 18 karat gold  jewelry  .Choose
from a wide variety of precious and semi-precious gems. If you are also
looking for an unusual piece, very often one of a kind, you are in the right
place. What a delight, don't miss it, even if you are just looking...<P>
<LI>NEW AMSTERDAM:<BR>
Enjoy a most interesting collection of incomparable gifts: Nautical cruise
wear, men's fashion including a well stocked Polo Boutique,pewter miniatures
and fine embroidered linen of all types. In fact I couldn't resist , and
purchased several unusual items, to bring back to the U.S.<P>
<LI>ASHBURRY'S :<BR>
Discover dazzling jewelry, the world's finest watches, designer fashion, fine
Italian leather goods of all kinds. Usually , prices are about 40 to 50% less
than the U.S.

<P><LI>
COLOMBIA EMERALDS INTERNATIONAL:
<BR>
One of the most reputable and renowned jewelry shop.You will enjoy the finest collection of  genuine Colombian emeralds,rubies,diamonds and sapphires. This exclusive shop is  located on both sides of the island.
</UL><P><DD>
So many exciting places to  visit,. The above mentioned are just a few...
Allow time to browse
Now, let's take a look at the other side of this beautiful tropical island,
the French Side :<P>

<DD>ST. MARTIN:<P>
<UL><LI>MARIGOT the capital city of French ST.Martin, will delight,you with its'
romantic outdoor cafes , haute-couture fashion, and gorgeous white beaches. 
For those of you who enjoy open air markets, this is IT! So many unusual and
colorful items to choose from...As on the Dutch side, ST.Martin has a wide
variety of shops.Let me give you a few:<P>
<LI>D'ORSY'S:<BR>
St Martin's showcase for quality fragrances. The shop carries brand names
such as; Guerlain,Cartier, Chanel,Givenchy etc...Remember, all duty free...
<P><LI>

PORT UNITED:<BR>
This shop displays some of the most comfortable and colorful beach wear. You will love it! When you are on a holiday, why not indulge a little ...
<P><LI>
ORO DE SOL :  <BR>
Offers an incomparable selection of 18 karat gold jewelry  and precious gems , as well as the finest watches. Don't miss it .....
</UL><P><DD>
This island is truly unique , in the fact that one senses the difference
between both sides . Neither side is an independent country.  St Maarten is
part of the  five island constellation of the Netherlands Antilles. St.
Martin , including Martinique and Guadaloupe ,is French territory.
Both sides offer fine  restaurants specializing in exquisite cuisine for all
tastes : Mediterranean, French, Italian, Tropical and local seafood.  I like
to eat in small  quaint restaurants, where I delight in discovering unusual
tropical dishes.   
As far as activities are concerned, you'll love St Maarten.Here is just a
small glimpse of what you can anticipate :
Scuba diving, wind surfing, snorkeling, water skiing, daily cruises and sky
 tours (helicopter or sea plane.
<P><DD>

If you are adventurous, you can take a cruise with BLUE BEARD charters. It's
definitely the ultimate Caribbean experience: You will sail from Marigot to
the island of Prickly Pear,fringed by turquoise water, long pure white
beaches and coral reef teeming with exotic tropical fish. Perfect setting for
the snorkeling enthusiast. Incidentally, snorkeling gear is provided by the
charter.Once you land on the island, a lunch will be provided, as as well as
an open bar... What an adventure...<P><DD>
For the ones of you who delight in quiet and beauty .there are several
magnificent beaches to choose from:<BR>
<DD>Mullet bay beach,Maho beach,Simpson beach ,and Little Bay beach These are
located on the Dutch side. Now for the French side:Baie Longue,Orient
Bay.coconut Grove,Baie Rouge  and Grand case beach.

<P><DD>
Each beach offers something for everyone's taste. I    would like to caution
the sun worshipers; Keep a shirt    on...
The night life on the island should not be overlooked.There are several
casinos that offers all kinds of entertainment: Mont Fortune casino, Grand
casino,
<P><DD>

 ...Casino International, Casino Royale, Atlantis casino,Golden casino, Rouge
et Noir and  the Coliseum casino. As you can see, to be entertained is the
least of your worries..
If you like dancing under  tropical stars,   that will not be a problem
either; the Merengue music of the tropics, is HOT, HOT, HOT...
No matter what your likes or dislikes are, there is something for everyone on
this paradise island. I, for one, am going back again and again, to enjoy
 not only the beauty of this tropical island, but the charm of its' people...

<TITLE> Getting Around St. Thomas </TITLE>

<center><H1> Getting Around St. Thomas is Half the Fun</H1>
<I>By :  Richard Meeuwsen  </I><BR>


<HR><P>
	<B><font size=-2>Note : This is before the hurricane. As of Dec 1995, St Thomas won't be ready until the fall of 1996.<BR> Pictures of <A HREF="tber.htm#images">Hurricane Felix </A>in Bermuda.</font></B><P></center></center>

	<DD>Glide through lush green vegetation on tortuous winding mountain roads set 
against a backdrop of sapphire and emerald colored waters.<BR>
	<DD>Getting around the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Thomas is only half the fun and 
can take many forms. <BR>
	<DD> All the major auto rental rental companies are represented on the island so 
you can take advantage of any frequent flier tie-ins and discount programs available 
to you. To guarantee a vehicle, you should call ahead because a reservation may be 
required. <BR>
	<DD>If you are accustomed to spacious US roads you're in for a shock.	 
Seriously consider departing from your usual large vehicle and opt for a small 
compact. Not only are they cheap  on gas but are actually better when trying to 
maneuver in limited space. Finding a precious parking space and driving the 
narrow roadways is much easier. You'll appreciate the added ease of negotiating 
those blind curves, hidden driveways, sudden stops and slowdowns of the vehicles 
ahead of you, small or nonexistent shoulders on the side of the road,  road craters 
and bumps, swerving to avoid vehicles in your lane and all the other assorted 
reasons for giving up part of your roadway including, but certainly not limited to, 
hikers, people meandering down the road, the occasional goat or cow, and wide 
trucks, taxis, busses and cars. Seat belts are required by law and dictated by 
common sense.<BR>
	<DD>All this must be taken into account as you re-orientate yourself to driving , 
turning, and parking on the left side of the road. <BR>
	<DD>Even though the highway directional signs might be missing at key points in 
your journey, your frazzled nerves can at least rely on your attempts to stay on your 
side of the ever present yellow center dividing line. Keep your other eye on the  
white line on your left. It indicates the edge of the road and the possible absence of 
any additional terra firma, the beginning of a long slide down a mountain side , a 
private driveway, a guardrail 6 inches away from you that is bent out ever so slightly 
towards you, visually impenetrable vegetation, the side of a hill, a house, a road sign 
or a parked car, truck or taxi.<BR>
	<DD>Speed limits are 20 in the city and 35 on the highways out of town. You need 
not worry about exceeding the limit until you become experienced because the 
traffic and roads automatically do that for you. <BR>
	<DD>If you prefer to leave the driving to other presumably more experienced 
drivers you can still enjoy the roller coaster thrills on a multipassenger open air safari 
type taxi, an enclosed air-conditioned taxi van or large sleek modern publicly 
operated air-conditioned Vitran busses.<BR> 
	<DD>Those high safari taxis are ideal for initial tours to get an overview and sense 
of direction. <BR>
	<DD>Comfortable enclosed taxi vans or automobiles are preferred for nighttime 
transport to the many resort or stand alone restaurants and night spots in the 
downtown area or on the island's east end. <BR>
	<DD>The Vitran busses stop at numerous, marked convenient locations 
throughout the city and countryside and safely expose you to just a little bit more of 
the real day-to-day lifestyle.<BR>
	<DD>To find the posted rates, review the widely distributed Visitor guides. Those 
established rates alleviate the irritating feeling of being victimized by those 
intentionally confusing condescending taxis drivers prevalent in other countries. You 
find nothing but pleasant and helpful drivers here.<BR>
	<DD>City traffic is bumper-to-bumper around noon and 5pm, so avoid those travel 
times unless you want to see the city, one foot at a time, from the comfort of your 
auto. <BR>
	<DD>Impromptu, or the published preplotted  self-guided walking tours of the  
Capital Charlotte Amalie is a welcome relief to motorized conveyances. Make sure 
you also go into the country and walk around the many small village- like 
congregations of buildings which sprout up around beaches, ferries, highway 
intersections and other attractions.<BR>
	<DD>Start your walking and shopping tour downtown by parking in the public lot 
next to Fort Christian. There should be  a space left early in the day but don't wait 
too long. Downtown parking spaces near the action are in very short supply. Illegal 
parking will cost you $25. Enter the Fort, built around 1671,  on the side of the 
building that faces away from Veterans Drive, which is the main driving drag  called 
highway 30. Climb the stairs to the roof to overlook Vendors Plaza where T-shirts, 
costume jewelry and leather goods are sold. You also can't miss the mint green 
Italian Renaissance Legislature Building and the Caribbean Sea across the road. 
There are many restaurants and roadside areas where you can get bigger and 
better views, so don't feel bad if you want to bypass the Fort for now and charge 
directly to Main Street where a good chunk of the Island's 400 stores are clustered.<BR>
	<DD>If the streets and sidewalks are too crowded (or not crowed enough for you), 
ask a friendly looking merchant to show you their list of ships in port. Usually 2 to 6 
cruise ships or large sailboats are scheduled to be in town for the day. The 
congestion, excitement and salespeople adrenaline will flow accordingly with the 
volume of people disembarking from the ships to shop. While soaking up the flavor 
of Main Street don't hesitate to veer off toward the sea and go down the many 
passages, alleys, gades and malls which jut off Main Street. You'd miss half the 
action if you simply follow the shops down to the Library, cross the road and then 
head back to the spot where you began.<BR>
	<DD>After your shopping ardor and curiosity are cooled a bit, relax at 
Blackbeard's Castle. Your hot feet and wallet  will appreciate it. The tower there was 
built in 1679 by Captain Edward Teach, the infamous blackbearded pirate, to watch 
for approaching ships. You can do the same, but do it from the restaurant, its much 
more comfortable, and you'll get the same wonderful view.<BR>
	<DD>If all this hedonistic consumption is wearing on your spirit, the Gothic revival 
style Fredericks Lutheran Church, dedicated in 1793, is open for viewing 8am to 
5pm on Mondays through Saturday , and for services on Sunday.<BR>
	<DD>If you are still up to it, take a walk up 99 steps. Notice the brick steps. They 
are the ballast from the bellies of Danish sailing ships which carried settlers to the 
area in the early 1600's.<BR>
	<DD>If you get really tired in the hot sun: don't worry, be happy! There will be plenty 
of taxis around you. Every minute or so they'll crawl by in the traffic and ask if you're 
ready to go back to the ship even though you may have gotten there by air. <BR>
	<DD>Merchant's signs and their street hawkers will also be continually enticing you 
into their store to check if yours is the lucky cabin number that wins their prize. After 
a short while you'll wise up and stop telling them you didn't come by ship, you'll 
simply say no thanks.<BR>
	<DD>Shopping the many fine stores is not a haggling nightmare . All  stores are 
eager to pull out their merchandise from under the lighted showcases and 
immediately tell you the discounted price. The quoted price is at least one half of the 
sticker price and it's not unusual if it's one third or less.<BR>
	<DD>If you linger long enough, some merchants will take off another 5-10% off the 
already lower stateside price. If you look really interested, but indecisive, they may 
also offer you a free beer or soda which sometimes feels better than a discount 
when you've been trudging through all those stores searching for the perfect gift.<BR>
	<DD>As they are quick to point out, sizing of rings is no problem. You can get it 
sized beautifully within the hour.<BR>
	<DD>It took 50 years for the US to finalize the $25,000,000  purchase of the 
islands from Denmark in 1917.  Your transactions will be much speedier. Major 
credit cards and traveler's checks are readily accepted. Agree to pay with cash and 
you might wrangle another 2-3% off the final discounted price. Since the island runs 
on US currency, there are no conversion problems either on the charge card 
statements or in your head when trying to get the best deal possible.<BR>
	<DD>Because the U.S.Virgin Islands (U.S.V.I.), composed of St. Thomas, St. John 
and St. Croix, are US protectorates, each family can purchase an average of 
$1,200 per person duty free. That is double the amount available elsewhere. The 
limit can include up to 5 cartons of cigarettes and 5 fifths of liquor. You can buy an 
extra fifth of liquor duty free if its Cruzan rum, Brugal Rum, Havensight Liqueur, 
Chococo or 100 proof Southern Comfort which are produced there.<BR>
	<DD>Sales tax  does not exist which helps on jewelry purchases. Most 
consumables are shipped in though which raises the cost of meals, clothing and 
other items especially lodging. If you fall madly in love with the place, as many 
people do, real estate is no bargain either.<BR>
	<DD>After shopping all day you'll want to be on the move again the following day. 
The Danish settlers which you hear most about came by slow boat. For the modern 
water enthusiasts, there are all sizes, shapes and combinations of power and sail 
boats from individual or group charters to inter-island ferries.<BR>
	<DD>The 20 minute ferry from Red Hook on St Thomas, to Cruz Bay on St John is 
a  bargain at $3 each way. For $7 you can take the longer 45 minute ferry from 
Charlotte  Amalie to Cruz Bay.<BR>
	<DD>Unusual sightseeing transportation includes 10 minutes for $50 or 20-30 
minutes for $110 in a helicopter. Or take a $68 3 hour combination harbor boat 
cruise and submarine tour. <BR>
	<DD>If flying is more your cup of tea, a diversion to St Croix is as close as a 25 
minute  $44 one way trip by air. <BR>
	<DD>Bring along your proof of citizenship if you decide to visit the British Virgin 
Islands by ferry. It's $28 round trip for a 40 minute ride to Jost Van Dyke. A $30 
round trip fare will get you a 30 minute ride to Tortola or a 1 3/4 hour ride to Virgin 
Gorda.<BR>
	<DD>However, the major reason all us cold weather escapees travel is to lay on 
warm, sunny, sandy beaches. Some of the best beaches in the world are in The 
Virgin Islands. <BR>
	<DD>On the north shore of St Thomas, Magens Bay has a huge beach on the 
bottom of the U shaped bay. It's is undoubtedly one of the world's most 
photographed beaches. The rock free sandy bottom extends evenly and far out into 
the bay. Surfers can get action at Hull Bay. Coki Point beach boasts great 
snorkeling due in part to the fish drawn by the nearby underwater park and the 
feeding they receive from the numerous people learning to snorkel and scuba dive.<BR>
	<DD>Other beaches are in abundance from the Capital in the center of the Island 
around to the east side. Sapphire Beach is  popular on Sundays, drawing an active 
young crowd to hear the live bands at the resort's seaside bar. During the week it 
thrives on families who come for the sea, the sand, great view towards St. John, 
Thatch Cay (pronounced "key"), Grass Cay and the yachts and sailboats heading 
for the adjacent marina.<BR>
	<DD>Morning Star Beach draws a more genteel crowd seduced to it by the 
elegant hotels nearby.<BR>
	<DD>St John is loaded with absolutely gorgeous beaches and views on its 
northern side. Two thirds of the island is National Park Service land, courtesy 
primarily of Lawrence Rockefeller who donated the land. Trunk Bay on St John is the 
site of a marked underwater snorkel trial.<BR>
	<DD>Beware if you see what looks like a small black, and  sometimes white, 
koosh ball in the water . It is a sea urchin whose barbs can inflict a painful sting.<BR>
	<DD>In all cases, check the visitor guides to determine availability of restrooms, 
showers, restaurants and beach equipment because a wide diversity  exists. 
Incidentally, nude bathing is rare at all beaches.<BR>
	<DD>Swimming will give you the appetite of a horse but dining can be simple or 
elegant depending upon your taste and budget. Once again Visitor Guides contain  
complete information on location, decor and price. Restaurants on the hills or in 
town can deliver a breathtaking view of the city by night or the city and sea by day 
but you have to search out the ones with views. Cuisine varies from local Creole 
dishes to french, oriental, Italian, or typical American fare. Look for special events 
such as steel bands, limbo dance contests, broken glass walking and Caribbean 
shows.<BR>
	<DD>Tennis and golf is alive and well on St. Thomas (sometimes pronounced 
"sont toe moss" by the refined or the snooty, depending on your viewpoint). 
However, I would limit spirited tennis matches to early morning or late afternoon to 
avoid the heat which you traveled great distances to enjoy.<BR>
	<DD>Wherever you are, if you get lost, don't panic. The Island is only 13 miles long 
and three miles wide. The natives, which can be of African, oriental, or European 
descent are usually helpful and pleasant. But, it seems that a lot of people have 
never laid eyes on a map before. <BR>
	<DD>It helps that they speak English, but sometimes it may not sound at all like 
what you are accustomed to. The local dialect removes the "h" in "th" so that it 
becomes "tis" for this and "tat" for that.<BR>
	<DD>Everyone on the Island seems to be prompted to say good morning, good 
afternoon or good evening. You will eventually exchange those greetings for your 
usual hi or hello. You take that away with you when you eventually must leave and 
head home. This adds a little bit of charm and elegance to an already classy place.<P>

<TITLE>Young Island Resort - St. Vincent & The Grenadines</TITLE>
<H1>Young Island Resort</H1>
<p>
<I>By :  Joan B. Hays </I><BR>
1995<P><center>
Young Island was <I>my</I> treat to myself.  I'd spent a week on a 40 foot sloop sailing in the company
of my husband Keith and a couple of his sailing buddies
and coming as near to death as I want to be. Well,
maybe not <I>that </I>close but it was a scary experience even if the
three master sailors saved the day. .<P>

Before we headed back to the real world of offices and paper work, I sent the two heros home and booked  the skipper myself three days of rest and relaxation at Young Island Resort<p >

Young Island Resort takes up the whole of an islet separated from the St.
Vincent mainland by just 200 yards of the Young Island Cut.  We loaded
Doug and R.K. into a taxi for the airport and we headed for the dock
waiting for the ferry to take us to Young Island.  After the 3 minute ferry ride landed us on a small dock, our luggage loaded was on a trolley and we were ushered to the office to check in.<p> 

While our luggage was taken up and the room readied for use, the clerk greeted us warmly by name, took an impression of our credit card then showed us to the dining room for breakfast .<p>

The dining room wasn't a room at all.  We were seated under a thatched
roof, open on all sides and surrounded with lush tropical foliage.  Now, I
am not a "breakfast person" but I have to tell you that rich coffee, just
baked bread and a selection of tropical fruit can whet even my morning
appetite.  Keith had his favorite, Eggs Benedict and I chose the flying
fish cakes.  It was outstanding.<p> 

After breakfast we went up to the room and I do mean UP.  Our suite, the
same one to which the management had hauled a grand piano for Leonard
Bernstein, was 158 steps up a stone stairway winding up the volcanic rock
that is Young Island.  The stairway twists through a lush hillside garden
of hibiscus, bouganvilla and poinsettia planted amoung ancient mahogony
trees clinging to the hillside.  Every 25 or 50 steps the stairway turns
back on itself and there is a stone bench on which to stop, sit, enjoy the
 view and catch one's breath.<p> 

The climb was worth it.  Our suite was at the top of the rock with a view
out over Blue Lagoon where we had left the boat with Bequia and Mustique
out on the horizon.  We were one half of a two unit building so well designed
that the residents of neither suite are aware of the other.  The
architect who designed the layout made each unit a island of privacy.  We
entered into a dining kitchenette area and were greated by the smell of
fresh brewed coffee with a basket of fresh fruits and bread on the table .
There is also a supply of coffee and tea for brewing in the coffee/tea maker
waiting in the tiny kitchenette.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="shower.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="patio.jpg"> 
 The spacious bedroom with twin kingsized beds was to the left, along with
the bathroom area with lots of closet space, twin wash basins, hair dryer
and w/c.  The shower was separate and outdoors.  It is open to the sky and
separated from the private patio by just a privacy screen of louvers to
let the breeze through.  The whole unit surrounds the patio and both the
bedroom and dining area are separated only by sliding screen doors.  The
heavy use of local woods in the construction set off by tasteful
decoration with local art works and pastel textiles is warmly inviting. 
The patio is furnished with a second dining table, chaise lounges and a
delightful hammock for swinging and air drying after a shower. Never
completely satisfied, Keith said that the only thing missing was a
private plunge pool on the patio of our suite to make it an ideal
honeymoon spot.  If you like, the staff will bring your meals to you and
once up, there is no pressing need to go down. <p>
<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="pool.jpg "> <IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC ="yibeach.jpg">
No reason, that is, unless you count the gardens, the large and
comfortable salt water pool in the gardens or the nice beach looking out
to the cut and the St. Vincent shore and the fine restaurant.  We tried to
plan out a schedule each morning so that the climb up was limited to
twice a day.  Besides, with the quality of Young Island's kitchens and the
quantity of the portions we needed the exercise to work off the
calories.<p>

One highlight of our too short stay was the beach barbeque on Duquoinois
Rock.  It rears out of the water just a hundred yards or so along side
Young Island.  A stairway to the top takes you to the ruins of the Fort
built in the 18th Century to control the access to the south part of St.
Vincent and with part of its battery of rusted cannon pointed inland, to
defend the garrison against the possibility of slave rebellion.  When
Young Island lays on a twilight beach barbeque the stair is lit with a
series of torches making the site a romantic setting for a picnic.<p>

There was one problem with paradise, one that I cannot blame on the
management at Young Island.  Before I tell you about it I want to make it
clear that the hotel staff is attentive and well trained.  We were treated
with politeness and concern throughout our stay at the resort.  The St. 
Vincent taxi driver was a different story.  Our plane to St. Lucia and
connections home left at 6:00 AM from St. Vincent's Arnos Vale Airport. 
That meant that we had to leave Young Island at 5:00 to give us time to
check in and clear immigration.  The night before our flight Keith had arranged
at the office for us to be picked up at the dock.  We rose early and
carried our luggage down.  We had been sailing and we had packed light and
Keith did not want to bother the staff at that hour.  When we reached the
dock on the St. Vincent side the taxi was not waiting as we had arranged. 
After about 15 minutes the ferry man called back to the office and was
told that they had nothing to indicate that a taxi had been called.  He
arranged another for us and we made it to the airport on time.<p> 

We were waiting at the ticket counter to check in when Keith was accosted
by a very angry young man demanding to know why we had not waited on him. 
We, he said, had cheated him out of his fare!  He claimed that he had been
at the hotel bar when Keith had arranged for the taxi with the barman.  Of
course, Keith had not been at the bar nor had he arranged a taxi with the
barman.  Finally, after much shouting and an ugly scene, Keith figured
that the only way we were going to shut the guy up was to give him money. 
Keith threw a 10 dollar bill at him and he went away cursing us in
particular and Americans in general.<p>

When I got back to he office I sent a fax to Young Island explaining that
experience and suggesting that it had made me wonder if I could recommend
St. Vincent to my clients.  I was just venting and I really did not expect
a response.  I got one the same day, promising to investigate and get back
to me when they had resolved the problem.  I did not expect to hear more. 
Again I was pleasantly suprised.  A week later I got a fax from the
manager who informed me that he had identified the driver involved and
had removed him from the list of approved taxi operators to be summoned
for Young Island guests.<p>

Despite that experience Young Island itself was a delight and one that I 
can wholeheartedly recommend to clients looking for a secluded romantic 
getaway. <p>

<LI><B>Information</B><BR>
<DD>The fifty small islands of the British Virgin Islands archipelago hide away in the Caribbean, north of
St. Kitts and just sixty miles east of Puerto Rico. Fifteen of the islands are uninhabited.<BR>

<DD>The population of the islands is just over 12,000 and everyone speaks English. Today, evidence of
bygone eras can be found in old sugar mills, plantation windmills, forts, churches, colonial
architecture, underwater shipwrecks and a shared sense of pride to preserve folklore, culture,
tradition and art. Many areas of the British Virgin Islands are now under the protection of a National
Parks Trust, a body established by the government to conserve and manage the natural beauty of the
islands. These range from the forest of Sage Mountain at the highest point of Tortola to the marine
site of the wreck of the R.M.S. Rhone.<BR>
<DD>The islands offer a rich landscape of colour; coastlines of white sand and palm trees; an unspoilt
playground for pelicans, booby birds and terns; some of the friendliest faces in the Caribbean; a
wide variety of local and international cuisine; a comforting lack of high rise hotels and casinos;
abundant watersports facilities; a balmy sub-tropical climate moderated by soft gentle breezes and
unspoilt surroundings for those people who wish to relax away from the crowds.<P>

legalese into intelligible language that you and your customers, suppliers. reps, employees and 
others can easily understand. 
 
 <P>
<H2>Keep  a Done Deal a Done Deal </H2><P><DD>
Our agreements support sales, not kill them. When you make a sale, sign on a new dealer or 
recruit a representative, the last thing you need is paperwork that no one will sign. When 
negotiations are over and you want to begin working together. You need to legally document 
your agreement quick and easily. 
 
 <P>
<H2>Full-Bodied Agreements </H2><P><DD>
Use them as you negotiate to avoid omissions, unintentional acts, or errors arising from 
ignorance, surprise, imposition or misplaced confidence. These agreements have been drafted by 
real-world business attorneys with input from business deal makers. They have been edited to be 
easily understood by non-lawyers. To define your expectations and cover contingencies, each 
agreement can be reviewed point-by-point and edited to suit your specific needs. 
 <P>
 
<H2>Forbidden Words Removed </H2><P><DD>
No more hereof, whereas, hereto, hereinafter, set forth, pursuant to, thereof, (and our favorite) 
notwithstanding the foregoing. Before Agreement Builder, it took time and effort to decipher and 
understand contracts. So we replaced the jargon with straightforward language. By establishing 
clear terms, you'll avoid legal haggling over ambiguities and lawsuits where the court must decide 
what you meant, what you and the other party did or didn't do and what it's worth. 
 <P>
 
<H2>With Comments & Cover Memo </H2><P><DD>
Each section includes expert comments to explain the meaning and purpose of the text. It's not 
hidden behind a help key because we wanted to make sure that you see everything  
you need to know before you make any changes. Also, each agreement includes a friendly, 
professional cover memo introducing the contract for your understanding, and it's very useful for 
you to use when sending your agreement to another person. 
 
<P> 
<H2>A Legal Foundation for You </H2><P><DD>
We provide a mini-course in contract law to provide some theoretical grounding in contract 
development and application. It's a lot of practical knowledge condensed into this section. And, 
it's a must to know. 
 
 <P>
<H2>Use Them Instantly </H2><P><DD>
Each of the 100+ agreements is formatted and ready to customize using any popular word processing software. 
That way you can use the documents right away and have complete control over the text and formatting. You can 
then direct your attorney to review and approve them or make necessary adjustments for unique circumstances. 
Now you have the contracts you'll need to make better deals.

<H2>A contract in plain English is just as binding as one in legalese.</H2></Center>
<P><DD>We've gathered together over 100 of the most essential business agreements and translated them into language that real people can actually

understand. Just open up the agreement you need and

customize it to your needs. It's already formatted,

so all you need to do is plug in your specifics and

print! All the agreements include a cover memo

which you can use as a friendly cover letter

introducing your agreement to others. Expert

comments within the text assure you understand each

element and explain exactly how and when you should

customize. The comments can even be left in to help

clarify specific points during negotiations.<P>

<DD>We've translated the unintelligible legal gobbledegook into everyday 

language so that you and your customers, suppliers, reps, employees 

and others can easily understand.  No more hereof, whereas, hereinafter, 

set forth, pursuant to, thereof, and our favorite, notwithstanding the 

foregoing (which means 'no matter what').  That way you have complete 

control over your text and formatting. Teaming up with real-world business 

attorneys and business deal makers we have created thorough, legally binding 

contracts that support business deals rather than kill them.  In fact, 

by cleaning up the language,  our contracts are even more effective than 

contracts full of traditional legal jargon.  By establishing clear terms, 

you'll avoid legal haggling over ambiguities and lawsuits where the court 

must decide what you meant.<P>


<H2>Save on legal fees.</H2><P><DD>
Any one of these legal agreements can easily be worth 10 times your investment.  

Think of it as your legal tool kit.  We've even provided you with a mini-course

in contract law to give you a strong grasp of the basic principles involved.  

For complex agreements or situations, it's a lot less expensive to have a lawyer 

review your agreement and adjust for special circumstances than to have him draft 

it from scratch.<P>

<BR>

&quot;No matter how trivial it seems, when you make an agreement with someone,

it's best to make it official with a signature. That's the idea behind JIAN's

AgreementBuilder 3.0. It's not a stand-alone application but a collection

of text documents: Just fill in the blanks to make those important contracts

official.&quot;

<BR>

<BR>



&quot;AgreementBuilder is straightforward: All the notes and areas where

you need to enter information are shown in color...&quot;<BR>

<BR>

&quot;...while AgreementBuilder won't replace your attorney, it may just

keep your costs down: With a draft contract in hand, your lawyer might not

feel obliged to charge so much for services.&quot;<BR>

<I>- Jack Lyon, P C Computing, May 1996 </I>

<BR> 

<BR>

<BR> 

&quot;JIAN's AgreementBuilder stands out from the rest of the pack... It

has document templates for a wide range of business needs, including all

the forms you'd want to operate a company on a day-to-day basis.&quot; 

<BR>

<BR>

&quot;AgreementBuilder and LoanBuilder provide templates for business agreements

and financial documents that small businesses commonly need. AgreementBuilder

includes documents for use in managing employees and contractors, building

sales and marketing relationships, and handling financial matters. LoanBuilder

provides business borrowers with templates for documents, spreadsheets,

and forms.&quot; <BR>

<h1>GroupWise 4.1 Electronic Messaging Architecture</h1>
<p>
<h2>White Paper</h2>
<A NAME="1"></A>
<h3>Section 1: Overview</h3>
In this document, we will explain how GroupWise offers feature-rich workgroup and enterprise
communication services. In addition, we will show how the unique strengths of the GroupWise
architecture provide a powerful and flexible foundation for workgroup computing solutions.
(Previous versions of GroupWise were known as WordPerfectOffice.)<p>

<p>

<h4>The Messaging System as a Workgroup Foundation</h4>
Not long ago, a messaging system was seen simply as a means for people to exchange E-mail
messages. However, as workgroup computing evolves, many agree that the right messaging
system can also erase the traditional boundaries of disparate applications, multiple operating
system platforms, and multiple geographical locations, thus extending the scope of workgroup
computing and making the virtual workgroup a reality.<p>

<p>

For a messaging system to provide a solid yet flexible foundation for workgroup computing
solutions, the messaging system architecture must be broad enough to support both an
organization's current needs as well as its future needs for the next 5 to 10 years. Its architecture
must therefore embody five important design principles. The architectural foundation:<p>

<p>


<ol>
  <li>Must be elegantly simple, yet powerful enough to handle very complex solutions.</li>
  <li>Must be flexible enough to change and expand without affecting the workgroup
applications and solutions already dependent upon it.</li>
  <li>Cannot be dependent upon a specific operating system or environment, but must be open,
portable, and full-functioned while operating on multiple existing and new operating
systems and environments.</li>
  <li>Must be powerful enough to work under multiple client/server operating models
concurrently to provide the best for process load-balancing and data security needs.</li>
  <li>Must be robust enough to support Novell's distributed document processing architecture,
as well as open enough to support other industry applications and standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>

The overall effectiveness of workgroup solutions depends in large measure on how much the
underlying messaging system architecture embodies these principles. As organizations look for
workgroup computing solutions, they should carefully consider both the workgroup applications
and the messaging system architecture that will provide the workgroup-enabling foundation for
those applications.<p>

<p>

Some vendors offer very attractive applications, but lack the architectural foundation to provide
truly effective workgroup solutions. Other vendors build their applications on "standard" E-mail
architectures, but their workgroup solutions lack flexibility and functionality because they are
built on foundations limited to basic E-mail services. Because workgroup computing solutions
are so dependent on the foundation of a messaging system architecture, we believe an
organization should first choose a workgroup computing foundation. Then the organization can
be very selective about the applications it chooses to build workgroup solutions on this solid
foundation.<p>

<p>

The GroupWise messaging system provides the messaging foundation for Novell GroupWare
applications and solutions. Because the GroupWise messaging system architecture was
developed according to the five design principles listed above, GroupWise is the best choice for a
workgroup computing foundation. Let us show you why.<p>

<p>
<A NAME="2"></A>
<h3>Section 2: GroupWise Positioning</h3>
Before explaining the details of the GroupWise messaging system architecture, it is important to
position GroupWise in the workgroup software industry. Workgroup software represents a broad
category of applications and services that help groups of people work together more efficiently.<p>

<p>

Because of the depth of GroupWise functionality, it encompasses several groupware categories,
including electronic messaging, calendaring/scheduling, and office automation.<p>

<p>

<h4>Electronic Messaging</h4>
For today's workgroup communication needs, simple E-mail is not enough anymore. GroupWise
provides the messaging services required for a strong workgroup computing foundation,
including:<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>Support for multiple message types (mail messages, schedule requests, task assignments,
scheduled calendar notes, phone messages, and custom messages)</li>
  <li>Workflow routing for collaborative work</li>
  <li>Full message status tracking for knowing when messages are delivered, opened, deleted,
accepted, declined, or delegated, and for tracking the progress of routed messages</li>
</ul>
<p>

No other vendor provides this unique mix of messaging services found in GroupWise.<p>

<p>

<h4>Calendaring/Scheduling</h4>
Several publications have rated GroupWise (and its predecessor, WordPerfectOffice 4.0) as the
best network scheduling application. GroupWise has won these awards based not only on its
advanced calendaring/scheduling feature set, but also because of its unmatched back-end
services. Functions like cross-platform and cross-post office free-time searches and remote
accessibility make GroupWise a leader in the calendaring/scheduling category.<p>

<p>

<h4>Integrated Office Automation</h4>
GroupWise also fits in the application category of integrated office automation software.
Applications in this category combine two or more workgroup services (such as E-mail and
group scheduling) in a single application or product offering. According to IDC (International
Data Corporation), GroupWise is the number one integrated office automation application, with
more than twice the installed base of its nearest competitor.<p>
<A NAME="3"></A>
<h3>Section 3: The Novell GroupWare Division</h3>
The Novell GroupWare Division, a business unit of Novell, is responsible for delivering
GroupWare applications and services. There are currently three products which are provided by
the GroupWare division. GroupWise is the electronic messaging application and provides
messaging services which are used by other applications. InForms is the application development
and forms processing product. SoftSolutions is the document management product and
associated services. Additional products and services will be added to the GroupWare family of
products to enhance the collaborative groupware solutions available. These additional products
and services will be developed both by the GroupWare division and by 3rd-party partners using
open interfaces to share common services.<p>

<p>

The Open Messaging Environment (OME) electronic messaging strategy guides the development
direction of GroupWise. The OME strategy incorporates strengths from today's GroupWise
products and services and those services available in MHS. The convergence of these
technologies will strengthen the already-robust messaging services in GroupWise. Additional
information about OME and overall GroupWise strategies is available in other technology briefs.<p>

<p>

Today's GroupWise product includes the following elements:<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>Full integration of messaging services</li>
  <li>Multiple-platform support</li>
  <li>Message-enabling capabilities</li>
  <li>Far-reaching connectivity options</li>
  <li>Comprehensive mobile computing solutions</li>
  <li>Powerful administration tools</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Integrated Messaging Services</h4>
At the heart of GroupWise's unique design is the integration of E-mail, scheduling, calendaring,
and task management services into a single application. The strategy behind this messaging
service integration is twofold. First, integration of the messaging services for E-mail and
scheduling eliminates duplication of back-end messaging resources, including user directories,
message transport, and especially the message stores. Second, combining all of these services
together under a single interface provides more consistent ease of use and reduced training costs
for the end users.<p>

<p>

<h4>Multiple-Platform Support</h4>
Supporting multiple operating system (OS) platforms and desktops has always been a strength
and trademark of Novell, and GroupWise is no exception. The GroupWise design strategy
includes bringing multiple OS platform versions of the client, server, and gateway software to
market quickly and consistently. GroupWise is designed to work as seamlessly in heterogeneous
computing environments as in those organizations that have standardized on a single OS
platform.<p>

<p>

<h4>Message-Enabling Desktop Applications</h4>
Bringing the messaging system to desktop applications is a major objective within the Novell
electronic messaging strategy. E-mail APIs, such as MAPI and CMC, allow desktop applications
such as word processors and spreadsheet programs to make calls directly into an API-compliant
E-mail system. In other words, the desktop application has become mail-enabled. For end users,
mail-enabling means the ability to mail the documents, spreadsheets, or graphics they're working
on without leaving their current applications.<p>

<p>

GroupWise brings more than just E-mail functionality to the desktop application. GroupWise can
message-enable an application by bringing the combined functionality of E-mail, calendaring,
scheduling, and task management into the applications that people use most. Message-enabling
means attaching an agenda to a meeting request, routing a document for review, and checking the
calendar, all without leaving the applications where users do most of their work.
Message-enabling means bringing the GroupWise collaborative services, such as workflow
routing, status tracking, and task management, to desktop applications. GroupWise does not to
force people into an unfamiliar work environment, but adds messaging functionality to the
applications they currently use.<p>

<p>

In addition to message-enabling applications, GroupWise provides a messaging system upon
which message-aware applications can be built. While a message-enabled application uses the
messaging system client to perform messaging functions, a message-aware application can
directly use the message transport, user directory, and message store of the underlying messaging
system. GroupWise is open enough to support the message-aware applications of the future.<p>

<p>

<h4>Connectivity Through Gateways</h4>
We are committed to providing open applications, as evidenced by the connectivity solutions
provided through GroupWise gateways. As organizations move up to the advanced messaging
capabilities of GroupWise, they must be able to provide interoperability with existing E-mail
systems, such as Lotus cc:Mail or IBM OfficeVision/VM, including both message exchange and
directory synchronization. Organizations also want an easy migration path, with the ability to
move users and their messages into GroupWise. The combined connectivity solutions and
migration services in GroupWise gateways give organizations the freedom to move as quickly or
as slowly as necessary into the next generation of electronic messaging, while preserving their
existing E-mail system investments.<p>

<p>

GroupWise gateways also provide connectivity to public and standards-based messaging
systems, such as X.400 and SMTP, for communication outside the organization. GroupWise is
designed to fit seamlessly into an organization's overall messaging system and to work well with
all of its components.<p>

<p>

<h4>Mobile Computing</h4>
As today's organizations become more mobile, people want the flexibility of not being tied down
to the office workstation. An important part of the Novell GroupWare strategy is to offer the
widest range of mobile computing options, giving people the freedom to access their messages
and information from whatever device best suits their needs. Laptop computers, telephones, and
pagers can all act as interfaces to the GroupWise messaging system.<p>

<p>

<h4>Administration</h4>
Good administration tools are incredibly important when implementing an enterprise messaging
system. Ironically, these administration tools are sorely lacking in the E-mail industry. The
Novell GroupWare strategy fills this void with the most powerful and flexible administration
tools available. Today, GroupWise offers both a central and distributed administration model that
works across different operating system platforms and networks. All administration work,
including object creation, software management, and server and gateway configuration, is
performed within a single, intuitive administration program that can be run from any workstation
on the network.<p>

<p>

Directory synchronization is completely automatic and an integral component of the
administration program. GroupWise also supports directory exchange (import/export) with major
network directories from within the administration program, as well as custom directory
exchange capabilities through the GroupWise API Gateway.<p>

<p>

Administration and maintenance typically constitute a large portion of the overall cost of
operating a messaging system. As additional improvements in administration and management
services are developed, all GroupWare products will eventually be supported by the same
administration and management platform. Compared to other messaging systems on the market
today, GroupWise is the easiest to administer, as well as being the most cost-effective messaging
system available.<p>
<A NAME="4"></A>
<h3>Section 4: GroupWise 4.1 Electronic Messaging Architecture</h3>
This section provides a technical overview of the core engine technology and administration
services that bring the GroupWise 4.1 electronic messaging system to life and make it the most
powerful and flexible messaging system in the industry. Before moving on to these subjects,
however, it is important to understand the basic components of the GroupWise messaging
system.<p>

<p>

<h4>Messaging System Components</h4>
GroupWise is a store-and-forward messaging system. The major message handling and
administrative components within the GroupWise system are the client, the post office, the
Message Server, the gateways, and the domain. The client is the end-user application. The Post
Office is the directory structure on a network file server that provides the message storage area
for a specific group of users. The Message Server is the message transport agent (MTA) within
the GroupWise system that provides routing services among post offices and through gateways.
The gateway is the connection and translation software for communicating between GroupWise
and other messaging systems. The domain is the basic administration unit consisting of the post
offices and gateways directly serviced by a Message Server.<p>

<h4>Core Engine Technology</h4>
The GroupWise core engine (shared code) technology lies at the heart of the GroupWise system's
simple yet powerful architecture. All GroupWise clients and Message Servers share the same
base code or core engine. The engine, which defines the core messaging functionality and
services, was created using object-oriented design and coding methods. The core engine's
object-oriented design provides unique benefits at several levels throughout the GroupWise
messaging system architecture.<p>

<h4>Consistency Across Message Types</h4>
All GroupWise message types, including mail messages, calendar items, meeting requests, and
task assignments, are defined within the core engine. In other words, all GroupWise clients and
Message Servers can handle multiple message types, making GroupWise the first product to truly
combine E-mail, calendaring, scheduling, and task management into the same LAN-based
messaging system.<p>

<p>

Not only are the various message types defined within the engine, but so are the GroupWise
messaging services, such as folders, rules, workflow routing, and file attachments. What this
means is that all message types share the same functionality. Listed below are some of the unique
functions shared by all message types in GroupWise 4.1:<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>Rules-based message management applies to meeting requests, task assignments, and
calendar notes as well as mail messages.</li>
  <li>Messages of all types are stored in the same folder structure.</li>
  <li>Workflow routing applies to both mail messages and task assignments.</li>
  <li>Files can be attached to any message type, including meeting requests and task
assignments.</li>
</ul>
<p>

This cross-message functionality is something that only GroupWise provides. For example, the
cross-message rules functionality allows users to auto-forward mail and auto-delegate meetings
and tasks while they are out of the office.<p>

<h4>Consistency Across Platforms</h4>
An equally important benefit of the core engine technology is the ability to provide literal
consistency of functionality across different platform versions of the GroupWise clients and
Message Servers. Because all clients and Message Servers share the same core engine code,
GroupWise can offer greater integrity of information, tighter security, and better reliability.
GroupWise can also offer concurrent access to a mailbox from multiple platform versions of the
client and Message Server.<p>

<p>

Finally, by virtue of the core engine technology, GroupWise was the first messaging product to
be released on three platforms simultaneously. The initial release of GroupWise 4.0 included the
Windows, DOS, and Macintosh client versions, all at the same level of functionality. The
GroupWise 4.1 products were released simultaneously on 11 client platforms (Windows,
Macintosh, PowerMac, DOS, and seven UNIX versions) and 10 server platforms (NLM, OS/2,
DOS, and seven UNIX versions). Each of these clients and services is fully compatible.<p>

<p>

<h4>Consistency Between Client and Server</h4>
The GroupWise core engine technology also offers unique client and back-end server
capabilities. Because both the client and the Message Server contain the same processing
capabilities, either or both can perform the same processing functions. For example, both the
client and Message Server can execute a workflow rule. If the client is running, it can execute a
user's rule. If the client is unavailable (turned off or not connected to the network), the server can
execute the rule on the user's behalf. This functionality is essential for reliable workflow
solutions.<p>

<h5>Load Balancing</h5>
The capability for both the client and Message Server to perform the same processing functions
also offers unique load-balancing functionality. The GroupWise Message Server includes a
threshold feature that lets the administrator determine what level of processing the client should
handle before turning over processing duties to the Message Server. For example, the client can
process small transactions quickly and efficiently with no perceptible performance degradation
for the end user, while freeing the Message Server to process other transactions, such as message
routing. At the same time, a user does not want to wait for the client to process a message to all
the people in a department or organization. The administrator can set a threshold that lets the
client process small transactions, such as message delivery to one or two recipients, while
passing all large transactions to the Message Server for processing. This load-balancing
functionality keeps the client and Message Server running at maximum efficiency and improves
the overall message processing speed.<p>

<p>

<h5>Multiple Processing Models</h5>
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the core engine technology is the ability to support
multiple processing models concurrently. For example, for single-post office systems that don't
require a server for message routing, the client can perform all message processing functions. For
systems with Message Servers, the client and Message Server can share processing
responsibilities, or all processing can be forced to the Message Server for security reasons. Each
domain (Message Server and associated post offices) within the GroupWise system can use the
client and server model that best suits that domain's needs.<p>

<p>

<h5>Mixed Platform Support</h5>
Another benefit of clients and Message Servers sharing the same core engine is the ability to mix
platform versions of the clients and Message Servers within the GroupWise system. Any
combination of clients can work simultaneously with any platform version of the Message
Server. All functionality and services are preserved, independent of platform and processing
location.<p>

<p>

The true power of the client/server engine design becomes evident in large enterprise messaging
systems. As clients of all platforms become interconnected across a wide-area network,
messaging performance, traffic load, and scalability all become very important issues. Because
clients and Message Servers can work together in accessing and processing messages
simultaneously and each is independent of the other, powerful combinations can be configured to
optimize the messaging system performance. For example, to increase messaging traffic
bandwidth and processing performance, a DOS-based Message Server could be replaced with an
OS/2-, UNIX-, or NLM-based server without affecting message flow or messaging system
integrity, regardless of the client platforms in use. (The high-end Message Servers provide from 3
to 10 times greater performance, compared to the DOS-based Message Server.) The core engine
design provides a true "plug and play" environment for clients and Message Servers.<p>

<p>

<h5>Multiple Communication Methods</h5>
Communication between the GroupWise clients and Message Servers is message-based (store
and forward). Client/server PC (InterProcess Communication) support will be implemented with
OME. While some messaging systems limit the client/server connection to one method or the
other, GroupWise will offer the flexibility of using either or both.<p>

<p>

The message-based communication model provides a fundamentally simple, yet powerful design
for cross-platform interconnectivity. Transaction messages are placed in a queue relative to the
client's post office. The Message Server, which may or may not be running on the same platform
as the client, can then pick up and process the transaction. All the client and Message Server need
to work under this transaction model is network file access to the post office.<p>

<p>

The client/server engine will also support IPC connections for those network configurations that
support direct client/server protocols. In this configuration, the client will pass all transactions
requests directly to the Message Server, which will process the requests in behalf of the client.<p>

<p>

<h4>Client and Server Engine Summary </h4>
The GroupWise client and server engine design provides shared processing and load balancing
between client and Message Server, combined client-only and client/server processing models,
true multi-platform "plug and play" flexibility with both clients and Message Servers, and
support for both message-based and IPC transaction processing. The client and server engine
design provides the greatest flexibility for organizations to build a truly functional and
high-performance messaging system on their local- or wide-area network.<p>

<p>

<h4>Consistency Across Gateways</h4>
How servers communicate and distribute messages among similar and dissimilar messaging
systems is becoming a critical issue for many organizations. The need to communicate with
people outside an organization's network or messaging system is driving organizations to look for
far-reaching connectivity solutions.<p>

<p>

GroupWise gateways are designed specifically to provide reliable and consistent connectivity and
interoperability solutions. All GroupWise gateways provide the same level of basic services and
support multiple message types. In addition, most GroupWise gateways provide passthrough
messaging and directory synchronization services.<p>

<p>

<h5>Consistent Base Services</h5>
Like the GroupWise clients and Message Servers, GroupWise gateways are built on a core
engine design. Thus, all gateways provide basic gateway services in the same way, ensuring
consistent handling of message information as it flows in and out of the GroupWise system.
These services include message queuing, address resolution (name-to-address lookup), status
tracking, directory synchronization, transaction logging, accounting, and more.<p>

<p>

<h5>Support for Multiple Message Types</h5>
Not only must a gateway connect GroupWise with another messaging system, it must also
preserve the integrity of the information flowing between the two systems. Because GroupWise
supports more message types than any other messaging system, GroupWise gateways must
effectively handle messages that are not natively supported in other systems.<p>

<p>

For example, if a gateway connects to an E-mail-only system, the gateway is intelligent enough
to convert all meeting requests and task assignments into the other system's E-mail message
format without losing any of the scheduling or task information. If, however, the gateway is
connecting to a combined E-mail and scheduling system, such as IBM OfficeVision or DEC
ALL-IN-1, the gateway can convert GroupWise meeting requests into a message format that the
other system understands. The gateway can also receive meeting requests from the other system.
Not only is the meeting information preserved, but also the ability to accept or decline the
request. The OfficeVision Gateway also supports busy searches between the GroupWise and
OfficeVision calendaring systems.<p>

<p>

<h5>Passthrough Messaging</h5>
Passthrough messaging lets GroupWise connect with another physically separate GroupWise
system, using a different intermediary messaging system as a transport. Passthrough messages are
encapsulated in the other system's message format and then unencapsulated when they reach the
remote GroupWise system. This encapsulation or tunneling preserves all messaging functions,
such as message status tracking, attachments, priorities, and calendar busy searches. It also
maintains administrative functions, such as directory synchronization, between the two
GroupWise systems.<p>

<p>

<h5>Directory Synchronization</h5>
Many GroupWise gateways also provide directory synchronization between GroupWise and a
different messaging system. For example, the GroupWise cc:Mail Gateway automatically updates
the cc:Mail directory with changes made in the GroupWise directory, and vice versa.<p>

<p>

A long list of GroupWise gateways built on the same core engine technology provides
consistency of gateway functionality, integrity of exchanged messages, and extensive
connectivity to other messaging systems.<p>

<p>

<h4>Administration Tools</h4>
Functional administration tools are as important as end user features. A powerful and flexible
messaging system requires an equally powerful and flexible administration program. GroupWise
provides the industry's most advanced system administration foundation for workgroup
computing solutions. The Administration (Admin) program provides central and distributed
administration, software distribution, end user setup, diagnostic and status reporting, full
directory services, and remote configuration capabilities.<p>

<p>

Administration of GroupWise software in NetWare 4.1 environments (when available) will be
done using the native NWADMIN program provided with NetWare. NWADMIN plug-in
modules will allow seamlessadministration of the GroupWise users and objects. The GroupWise
directory will first be synchronized with, and then eventually replaced by, NDS as the directory
service in NetWare environments.<p>

<p>

<h4>Central and Distributed Administration</h4>
The GroupWise administration architecture supports both a central and distributed administration
model. All GroupWise administsration can be done centrally by a single person, regardless of
system size and the location of the various system components. Administration responsibilites
can also be divided among multiple administrators, each with responsibility for a specific
domain.<p>

<p>

<h4>Object Creation and Management</h4>
The Admin program is the control center of the GroupWise system. The administrator uses the
Admin program to create and manage any object (user, scheduler resource, post office, or
domain) within the GroupWise system. After installing a Message Server or gateway, the
administrator uses the Admin program to set up and configure that application.<p>

<p>

The Admin program also includes extensive object maintenance facilities, including the ability to
modify or move users from one post office to another, and the ability to fine-tune Message Server
and gateway configurations.<p>

<p>

<h4>Software Management</h4>
GroupWise client software is installed first to the primary domain directory. From there, the
Admin program can distribute the client software to any new post office or domain. Each end
user can run the client software from the post office on the network, or can install the client
software to the local workstation using the special setup programs available at each post office.
Previously installed versions of client software will be automatically updated when the post
office copy is updated by the administrator. This allows the software distribution to be
accomplished automatically without requiring administrative intervention at the end-user
workstation.<p>

<p>

<h4>End User Setup</h4>
The GroupWise administrator can use the Admin program to customize preferences (setup
options) for each user. The administrator has the option to set default preferences or to lock the
preferences so users can't change them.<p>

<p>

Preferences can be defaulted or locked at several levels. Domain preferences apply to all new
users created within the domain. Post office preferences, which override domain settings, apply
to all new users created at a specific post office. Preferences can also be set at the individual user
level, overriding any domain and post office preferences.<p>

<p>

<h4>Directory Service</h4>
We have spent a tremendous amount of time and resources in the research and development of
the GroupWise directory service. Embedded within the Admin program, the directory service
supports both a central and distributed naming authority model. As with central administration,
central naming authority implies that all administration is performed at the directory service
database in the master domain. Distributed naming authority means that multiple administrators
can exist within the system, each having authority to administer the directory within his or her
domain.<p>

<p>

Some may ask why we decided to create its own directory service when network directory
services are already available. The reason is that Novell GroupWare applications run on a wide
variety of networks and across a wide range of operating system platforms. Most organizations
don't have a single directory system that fully operates across its various networks and operating
systems. The GroupWise directory service acts as the glue or logical naming system for the entire
workgroup enterprise.<p>

<p>

For those organizations that already have a standard directory system, the GroupWise
administrative architecture is flexible enough to support directory exchange (import and export
of user names in a common file format) or directory synchronization through the GroupWise API
Gateway. The GroupWise messaging system currently supports directory synchronization
through gateways to the following messaging systems:<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li>Novell NGMHS</li>
  <li>IBM PROFS and OfficeVision/VM</li>
  <li>DEC Message Router</li>
  <li>Lotus cc:Mail</li>
  <li>Banyan ENS (under development)</li>
  <li>Lotus Notes (under development)</li>
</ul>
<p>

Directory synchronization can also be built for any other messaging system, using the GroupWise
API Gateway.<p>

<p>

Others may ask if we are interested in supporting industry directory service standards. The
answer is yes. The modular design of the GroupWise administrative architecture will allow us to
develop open interfaces with network operating system directories as well as industry standard
directories. With these interfaces, GroupWise user names can be stored natively within the
alternate directory. Even in today's GroupWise directory, users can be defined with native X.400
addresses, thus allowing these names to be fully interchangeable with X.500-based systems.<p>

<p>

Directory services are critical to current and future workgroup solutions. As organizations fully
define new business processes, message-enable their applications, and rely more on the
messaging system for distributed computing, the directory service becomes the central repository
of workgroup user information.<p>

<p>

<h4>Diagnostics and Statistics</h4>
The ability to monitor and diagnose the system is currently missing in most LAN-based
messaging products. Novell GroupWise offers support for SNMP management of its Message
Server programs. GroupWise also offers diagnostic and status reporting services with the Admin
program. These capabilities set GroupWise apart from the competition. The administrator can
monitor the heartbeat, or message flow, of the system and automatically be notified of system
problems via mail message, pager, or voice mail. Novell GroupWise is the leader in workgroup
administration services today and will continue to open its services to embrace network vendor
services and industry standards in diagnostic and monitoring protocols, such as SNMP (Simple
Network Management Protocol).<p>

<p>

<h4>Remote Administration</h4>
Sometimes overlooked, remote administration is the final piece of a complete administration
architecture. All of the administration services discussed to this point are of limited use unless
the administrator can modify, fine tune, and reconfigure the system from anywhere within the
system. The administrator can run the GroupWise Admin program from any workstation on the
network, as long as it has network file access to the domain directory where the Admin program
is stored.  Server and gateway operational configuration modifications can also be done via any
SNMP management platform. The administrator can also create and configure any GroupWise
object (such as a user, post office, or domain) anywhere in the system without leaving the
administrator's workstation, providing the workstation has the necessary network access. These
remote administration features are part of why GroupWise has the most powerful and flexible
administration tools available.<p>

<p>

<p>
<A NAME="5"></A>
<h3>Section 5: Summary</h3>
Organizations looking for a solid architecture or foundation upon which to build workgroup
computing solutions should start with a powerful and flexible messaging system. They should be
sure the messaging system supports multiple message types and that it is flexible enough to run
on multiple operating systems and under multiple processing models (client-only and
client/server). They should also make sure the messaging system they choose is open to as many
other messaging systems as possible.<p>

<p>

Equally important to a strong messaging system architecture is the ability to effectively
administer the system. Organizations should look for a messaging system that provides effective
object and software management, as well as the ability to configure end user setup options. The
system's directory service must stretch across the boundaries of disparate network and computer
operating systems and be open enough to work well with NOS and industry standard directory
services. Finally, the messaging system must allow the administrator to access all of these
services from anywhere on the network.<p>

<p>

The GroupWise messaging system architecture was built using these attributes as the blueprints.
Organizations can rest assured that the GroupWise architecture can serve as the foundation for
their workgroup computing needs both now and for many years to come.<p>

appointments, scheduled tasks, and phone messages. With rules, you can forward,
delete, reject, delegate, reply to, move to a folder, or mark as private any
message. Any word or combination of words in any part of a message can trigger
rules. Because rules are server based, message management is automatic whether
or not the user is logged in.</P>
<H3>Criteria Filter</H3>
<P>GroupWise's filter lets you display only the messages you want to see. You
can filter the In Box, Out Box, appointment list, task list, note list, or
trash. You can set the criteria to display items you receive from a specific
sender, items sent to a specific recipient, items with attachments, items to be
completed, and more.</P>
<H3>Capability to View and Launch Unlimited Attachments</H3>
<P>With GroupWise, you can attach an unlimited number of files of any type
(even voice and sound) to your messages. The launching capabilities of GroupWise
enable you to easily select an attached file and launch the appropriate
application to view, edit, or print the file. In Windows and Mac OS, you can
view a file with SCC viewers without launching the application.</P>
<H3>In Box and Out Box</H3>
<P>A single In Box holds all your incoming messages such as mail, appointments,
tasks, and notes. The Out Box lets you know if and when messages are delivered,
opened, and deleted; who has completed and who is holding a routed message; and
who has accepted, rejected, or delegated scheduled requests. You can also
retract, modify, and resend scheduled requests, scheduled tasks, and unopened
E-mail messages.</P>
<H3>Access Lists</H3>
<P>Access Lists are useful when you leave the office and need someone else to
manage your messages. Through Access Lists, you can grant read or read/write
access to your appointments, E-mail messages, tasks, and notes. Only authorized
proxies can access messages marked private. You can grant other users access to
message notifications, calendar alarms, and preferences.</P>

post office workgroup on the network.</P>
<H3>GroupWise 4.1 Clients</H3>
<P>The GroupWise 4.1 Client software enables you to access your mailbox and
send messages. GroupWise 4.1 is available for Windows, UNIX, Mac OS, and DOS.
You will need to purchase client software for each platform on which you will
run GroupWise 4.1. Except for platform-specific features, the GroupWise Clients
are similar in functionality.</P>
<H4>GroupWise 4.1 for Windows Client</H4>
<P>The GroupWise 4.1 for Windows Client software runs on networked PCs in the
Windows environment or as a remote client. It has also been optimized to run
with the OS/2 2.1 operating system. The Windows Client package includes the DOS
Admin. GroupWise 4.1 for Windows Client includes the following platform-specific

<LI>Enhanced View Designer that enables you to add macros</LI></UL>
<H4>GroupWise 4.1 for UNIX Client</H4>

workstations. The UNIX Client package includes both the DOS and SunOS Admin.
GroupWise 4.1 for UNIX Client includes the following platform-specific features:</P>
<UL><LI>Support for seven UNIX platforms (SunOS, Solaris 2, SCO UNIX, DG
AViiON, SVR 4-Intel, Hewlett-Packard 9000, and IBM RS/6000)</LI>
<LI>Mouse support for X Window System clients</LI>

<H3>GroupWise 4.1 Admin</H3>
<P>The GroupWise 4.1 Admin component of the GroupWise 4.1 package provides the
software and documentation necessary to set up a single post office within your
organization. GroupWise 4.1 Admin makes it easy for you to create a post office,
add users and resources to the post office, and add secondary domains to the
system.</P>
<P>A mailbox license is required for each user. The GroupWise 4.1 Client and
Admin software includes one five-user license. For more than five users, you
need to purchase additional mailbox licenses separately. (For 20 or more
additional mailbox licenses, you can order volume licenses at a lower cost per
license.)</P>
<P>The GroupWise 4.1 Admin for DOS program is included with the Windows, UNIX,
Macintosh, and DOS Clients and is used to administer all components of the
GroupWise messaging system. GroupWise 4.1 Admin for DOS introduces an incredibly
simple and straightforward installation procedure. You can use the DOS
administration program for setting up the native UNIX GroupWise components using
either NFS or major Windows/DOS emulators on UNIX. The UNIX Client also includes
GroupWise 4.1 Admin for SunOS, which provides a powerful administration program
for users who run GroupWise 4.1 on a Sun SPARCstation.</P>
<P>GroupWise 4.1 Admin includes GroupWise 4.1 NDS Integration Tools. These
tools are NLMs that enable you to either perform GroupWise administrative tasks
from within the Novell Directory Services (NDS) administration program or create
rules to synchronize user information between the GroupWise and NDS databases.
There are two GroupWise 4.1 NDS Integration Tools: the GroupWise Integration
Module and the GroupWise Synchronization NLM. Each tool has its own set of
features and requirements.</P>
<H4>GroupWise Integration Module</H4>
<P>The GroupWise Integration Module is a snap-in tool for the NetWare 4.1 NDS
administration program, NetWare Administrator (NWAdmin). The GroupWise
Integration Module enables you to manage GroupWise user and resource objects
from within NWAdmin. For example, with the GroupWise Integration Module, you can
automatically assign GroupWise mailboxes to new users as they are created,
assign mailboxes to existing users, create distribution lists, or maintain post
office databases&#151;all from within NWAdmin. The GroupWise Integration Module
is recommended for networks with several GroupWise post offices that frequently
add, delete, or modify user and resource objects. It offers the following
services:</P>
<UL><LI>Enables management of GroupWise users from NWAdmin, including those
whose access to NDS is through bindery emulation</LI>
<LI>Enables management of GroupWise resources from NWAdmin</LI>
<LI>Automatically assigns GroupWise mailboxes to new users created in NWAdmin</LI>
<LI>Enables assignment of mailboxes to existing NetWare users</LI>
<LI>Enables you to set limited preferences</LI>
<LI>Lets you run the Maintenance Utility &quot;ofcheck&quot; against Domain and
Post Office message stores</LI></UL>
<P>The following hardware and software are required for the GroupWise
Integration Module:</P>
<UL><LI>8MB of RAM</LI>
<LI>2MB of free disk space</LI>
<LI>GroupWise 4.1</LI>
<LI>Windows 3.1 or above</LI>
<LI>NWAdmin</LI></UL>
<H4>GroupWise Synchronization NLM</H4>
<P>The GroupWise Synchronization NLM is a rules-based, back-end tool that
offers highly automated synchronization of user information between NetWare 4.1
and GroupWise 4.1. With the GroupWise Synchronization NLM, changes made in the
NDS database are automatically made in the GroupWise database, according to the
rules you establish. For example, the GroupWise Synchronization NLM can
automatically add new users to a GroupWise post office or simultaneously modify
a GroupWise user account when you modify the corresponding NDS user object.</P>
<P>The GroupWise Synchronization NLM is recommended for networks with several
GroupWise domains and offers the following services:</P>
<UL><LI>Provides rules-based directory synchronization between NetWare 4.1 and
GroupWise 4.1</LI>
<LI>Services multiple GroupWise post offices and domains</LI>
<LI>Automatically adds new NetWare 4.1 users to GroupWise post offices</LI>
<LI>Automatically modifies GroupWise user records when you modify NDS user
objects</LI></UL>

<P><DD>I have personally used the windows 3.x version for many years with little complaint. I've used it with my scanner instead of the software supplied by the manufacturer.
<P><DD>This new windows 95 and NT version is sure to be just as useful for most of your picture and painting needs.

<H2>New Product</H2>
<p><DD> 
On June 11, 1996, IBM introduced VoiceType 3.0 for Windows 95 to the    
worldwide marketplace. This product combines significant new navigation 
and dictation capabilities designed for users in business and industry, 
as well as professionals in health care, law, journalism, government,
and education. It takes voice recognition to new heights of performance.
<p> <DD>
VoiceType 3.0 is a software-only solution that's speaker-independently
and offers exceptionally high accuracy out-of-the-box. Among the many
benefits made possible by the new version are: eyes-free and hands-free
dictation, ease-of-use, deferred correction, no enrollment, and the
ability to dictate into most popular word processing applications.
<p> <DD>
We believe IBM VoiceType 3.0 illustrates the state of the art
in voice recognition. Other products in the VoiceType family include
IBM VoiceType Dictation Vocabularies for Legal, Medical, and Journalism
professionals; IBM VoiceType Control 3.0; IBM VoiceType Developer's
Toolkit; IBM VoiceType Dictation for OS/2, Windows 3.x and Windows 95.
<p> <DD>
Many developers are using VoiceType to develop
complementary tools and innovative user interfaces. These products and tools,
in conjunction with IBM's network-centric solutions, provide a choice of
platforms and applications to the professional and business communities.
<p> <DD>
Voice recognition is unleashing the full potential of personal computing. IBM
wants to be your partner in this exciting transformation.

<CENTER><h3>VoiceType 3.0 Lets Users Naturally Interact with Computers </h3></CENTER>         <P><DD>                                                                           
VoiceType* 3.0 for Windows 95, enables users to work with their computer simply by talking to
it.  Without even touching a keyboard or mouse, computer users can open
applications, dictate memos, e-mail messages and edit documents with the most
accurate speech recognition product on the market.
<p><DD>
 "Speech recognition technology is improving by leaps and bounds, and quickly
moving towards the mainstream computing market," said Jan Winston, worldwide
manager, IBM Speech Systems.  "With this latest addition to the VoiceType
family, VoiceType 3.0, we improves the highest accuracy rate and word
throughput in the industry, making IBM the leader when it comes to the way
people will work and use their computers."
<p><DD>
 VoiceType 3.0 is especially useful for customers who generate large amounts
of text and need to increase efficiency and reduce turn-around time, as well
as in professions that require hands-free computing.  For example, business
executives can efficiently process electronic mail by simply telling the
computer: "next," "discard," "reply," and so on.
<p><DD>
<CENTER><h3>Start Talking Right Away</h3></CENTER>
<p><DD>
 The newest member of IBM's VoiceType family features a combination of
continuous navigation and discrete dictation in a speaker-independent
product.  Speaker-independent means that users do not have to train the
computer to adapt to their individual voice.  People can begin talking to
their computer immediately, right out of the box.  The software's ability to
learn as users continue to use it enables the computer to improve the accuracy
rate over time.  In addition, users can dictate text directly into the most
popular applications such as WordPro*, Word*, and Lotus Notes*.
<p><DD>
 Delayed and delegated correction capabilities are also new to VoiceType 3.0.
Delayed correction allows a user to edit a document hours or days after
dictating the original.  Delegated correction lets the user pass the original
letter, memo or other document to someone else in the department for editing
purposes.  The person responsible for editing the dictated document can open
it immediately and make changes.  In addition, VoiceType 3.0 records the voice
of the original user, which can then be played back during the editing process
to help with contextual understanding of words or phrases in the dictated
text.
<p><DD>
 Other improvements include compatibility with industry standard sound cards,
like SoundBlaster*, and Mwave* technology, and continuous speech navigation.
The continuous speech function lets users interact naturally with the computer
when using the navigation feature.  For example, the software program will
respond accurately to the command, 'Go to Lotus Notes*' and 'open mail.'
<p>
<CENTER><h3>Speech Capabilities for OS/2</h3></CENTER>
<p><DD>
 The next client version of IBM's 32-bit OS/2 operating system, code-named
Merlin, will include a subset of VoiceType speech navigation and dictation
capabilities integrated into OS/2.  The integrated product continues to extend
IBM's leadership in the speech recognition marketplace across multiple
platforms.  Merlin, in beta this month, will ship later this year.
<p>
<CENTER><h3> System Requirements </h3></CENTER>
<p><DD>
 The new version of VoiceType works with most Pentium* computers available
today, which are equipped with industry-standard sound cards, such as
SoundBlaster, and does not require additional hardware.  System requirements
for VoiceType 3.0 are 30 MB hard disk, 16 MB RAM and a 90 MHz Pentium with
256K L2 cache or faster.
<p>
<CENTER><h3>Availability and Pricing </h3></CENTER>
<p><DD>
 VoiceType 3.0 for Windows 95 is priced at $699,  with upgrades for previous
users of VoiceType, including OS/2 and Windows 3.x, listed at $99.  Both the
standalone version and upgrade, which ship with a microphone at no additional
cost, are available today from IBM Business Partners.  In addition, IBM will
ship VoiceType 3.0 for Windows 95 in Spanish, French, German, Italian and U.K.
English by the end of the month of June.
<p><DD>
 IBM, with a family of VoiceType products and more than twenty years of
research, has built a team of speech recognition specialists worldwide,
dedicated to the development, support and sale of VoiceType solutions in many
languages.  The VoiceType family of products includes VoiceType 3.0 for
Windows 95, VoiceType for OS/2 Warp, VoiceType Dictation 1.32 for Windows 3.x,
VoiceType Control 3.0 and VoiceType Development Toolkit.  For more information

<H2>Even More Product Information</H2>
<DD>Now you can free yourself forever from using your 
computer in the conventional way and work smarter -- in 
a way that's more productive...simply by speaking. With 
VoiceType(TM) Dictation 3.0 for Windows(R) 95, you'll 
be able to dictate text directly into your applications 
and navigate your desktop or notebook computer...using 
just your voice.

<p>
<Center><h3>Voice your independence</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
Speech is the most natural and effortless means of 
human communication, and thousands of people around the 
world are already computing with the power of speech, 
thanks to IBM's tried and tested VoiceType technology. 
Created for the Windows 95 environment, VoiceType 
Dictation 3.0 boasts second-to-none accuracy and speed, 
while setting a new standard for ease of use.
<p><DD> 
Because it's speaker-independent, VoiceType Dictation 
will recognize different speech patterns. Based on 
customer tests, it's also more than 90% accurate for 
most people right out of the box -- without enrollment. 
Plus, VoiceType Dictation will learn from you as you 
work with it. In fact, the more you use it, the better 
it gets! Although enrolling is optional, it can 
increase accuracy even further. More than one person 
can use it in a collaborative environment, by creating 
separate users.
<p> 
<Center><h3>Speaking of accuracy...</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
When we say that IBM VoiceType Dictation offers second-
to-none accuracy, we can say it with confidence. That's 
because IBM's proven technology leads the industry. By 
using what we call 'isolated word' -- or speaking each 
word individually -- the program precisely translates 
your words into text. The VoiceType system not only 
searches for an acoustic match to any word you say, but 
can even differentiate between like-sounding words such 
as 'to,' 'two,' and 'too,' by analyzing them in 
context.
<p> <DD>
<Center><h3>Let's talk productivity</h3></Center>
<p><DD> 
When it comes to speed, VoiceType Dictation takes the 
lead. In fact, you can dictate between 70 and 100 words 
per minute -- faster than most people can type. You'll 
work even more quickly using VoiceType Dictation's 
'macro' function -- a way of combining multiple steps 
with one command -- to create input shortcuts for 
frequently used blocks of text.
<p> <DD>
VoiceType Dictation lets you work with both your hands 
and eyes free, so you'll be able to interact with your 
applications easily, naturally and more productively.
<p><DD> 
The benefits are enormous: Because you don't have to 
keep your eyes on the screen, you can dictate out in 
the field or in your car...Research scientists can work 
with a microscope and dictate their findings 
simultaneously...A radiologist can dictate a report 
while reviewing X-rays...Attorneys can review cases and 
dictate pertinent information -- without ever taking 
their eyes from their papers.
<p> <DD>
Whatever your business, with VoiceType Dictation you'll 
enjoy the benefits that come from increased personal 
productivity. You'll also have the assurance that comes 
from knowing you can:
<ul> 
<li>Spell correctly -- without running spell check.
 
<li>Create letters, memos and confidential reports 
yourself -- even after hours -- with fast turnaround.
 
<li>Work anytime and anywhere you like -- at the 
kitchen table, in your hotel room, or out in the field 
-- with VoiceType Dictation on your notebook computer.
 
<li>Dictate text while you sit back, relax and rest 
your eyes.
 
<li>Make the most of your computer, even if you 
aren't an accomplished typist or can't use a keyboard.
</ul>
<p>
<Center><h3>Speak your mind</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
It's only natural that we've made IBM VoiceType 
Dictation 3.0 so easy to use. For example, the program 
doesn't require that you correct errors right away, so 
you can concentrate on what you're doing -- not on how 
to do it. You can make corrections whenever you like -- 
as you work or later on. This means you can use the 
system freely, with your eyes and hands free -- for 
example, to work with reference material. And since 
there is no need to watch your screen or break your 
train of thought to make corrections, you can sit back 
and relax and keep your mind on your dictation.
<p> <DD>
What's more, you can choose to save your work and have 
someone else make any necessary corrections later. Or 
play back an audio version of your dictation for 
editing and correction. It's that convenient.
<p> <DD>
VoiceType Dictation also lets you create your own 
templates for filling in forms quickly and easily with 
faster turnaround and fewer mistakes. With VoiceType 
Dictation and a notebook computer, architects, police 
and other professionals can quickly fill out forms in 
the field -- simply by speaking. Doctors' offices can 
enter patient information and progress notes. Others 
can use VoiceType Dictation as a productivity aid for 
sophisticated data- center operations.
<p> <DD>
<Center><h3>You dictate the way you work</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
Now you can use VoiceType Dictation to create text in 
your favorite applications! You simply dictate directly 
into a program like Microsoft(R) Word. Using VoiceType 
Dictation with other applications couldn't be easier -- 
a quick dictation window pops up automatically to let 
you know if an application is not speech-aware.
<p> <DD>
The program gives you a wide variety of ways to dictate 
text and integrate your applications, including 
VoiceType Dictation's own speech-aware word processor, 
called VoicePad. You can also create your own dictation 
shortcuts -- called macros -- for often-used text or 
your return address, for example.
<p> <DD>
VoiceType Dictation comes with a large 22,000-word base 
vocabulary, to which you can add another 42,000 words 
of your own! If you like, you can choose to add your 
client name-and-address database, product names or 
other business-specific data to your personal 
vocabulary.
<p> <DD>
<Center><h3>Talk is cheap!</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
You'll be on speaking terms with your computer right 
away because there's no proprietary hardware to install 
-- VoiceType Dictation 3.0 works with the standard 
Sound Blaster(TM)-compatible or Mwave(R) sound card you 
may already have. Plus, the software is quick and easy 
to load from CD (or diskettes, if you prefer), so you 
can give your PC a good talking to in no time.
<p> <DD>
The price is extremely attractive, too... You get 
everything you need in one package -- including a high-
quality microphone! It's a comfortable active-noise 
cancelling headset microphone that gives you freedom of 
movement while cutting out ambient noise. The earpiece 
speaker offers private audio feedback.
<p> <DD>
<Center><h3>At your command</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
VoiceType Dictation's VoiceCenter is the hub from which 
you can easily control your computer with voice 
commands -- move around your desktop...start or switch 
applications...save or print a file -- all by speaking 
in your normal voice. Take advantage of the 
multitasking abilities of Windows 95 -- just use your 
own voice to switch between and control your favorite 
applications.
<p> <DD>
The control component of VoiceType Dictation works with 
continuous spoken commands and macros -- words run 
together as you would normally talk -- while the 
dictation component works with discrete, or isolated, 
speech -- a slightly more distinct way of speaking that 
leaves a one-tenth of a second gap between each word.
<p><DD> 
As you work with the VoiceCenter, the talk area 
displays what the computer heard you say -- or a polite 
'pardon me?' if it didn't understand you. The 'what can 
I say' window will help you out if you're not sure of 
an exact command. You can also create custom voice 
commands or speed up often-repeated actions by 
combining them under a single command. Of course, if 
you wish, you can use your keyboard and mouse, too.
<p> 
<Center><h3>We speak your language</h3></Center>
<p> <DD>
IBM VoiceType Dictation 3.0 is available in six 
languages -- French, German, Italian, Spanish, U.S. 
English and U.K. English, with Chinese and Japanese 
coming soon.
<p> 
<Center><h3>From the IBM speech family</h3> </Center>

<UL> Because I got arthritis from my trip there !</UL> 
<UL><UL>Concerned ? Read on ! </UL></UL> </B></font>
<HR></center><P> 
<H2>What The Chamber of Commerce Doesn't Want You To Know !</H2> 
          <DD>My wife and I took a trip to sunny, warm, beautiful Acapulco in Feb 1995. It turned into a 
nightmare for me !<BR> 
           <DD>While there, I noticed a small bug bite on the back of my neck. This was Wednesday morning 
about 5 days after we arrived there. I took a normal precaution and put some antiseptic lotion on it. 
However, that did not help. The bite grew into a progressively bigger and bigger lump. It never went 
away.<BR> 
          <DD>The days were sunny and the nights were beautiful. But something was going wrong, terribly 
wrong.<BR> 
           <DD>About 10 days after we got home from our 10 day vacation, my left wrist swelled up. Then my 
right wrist swelled up. Always from left to right it spread inexorably into my wrists, arms, elbows and most 
dramatically into my knees.<BR> 
            <DD> Eventually I took five different medications, went to 4 different doctors, had three lymes tests 
and an assortment of other laboratory work performed. 
             <DD> What was the result? Increasing pain and panic occurred. At the worst point of it, I could 
barely pick up my leg to step up onto a curb. Was this disease ever going to stop getting worse? Anti-
inflamatory, pain and sleeping pills did nothing to make it better. I was getting gaunt looking. I'm sure 
people thought I had some dreadful illness. They were right!<BR> 
               <DD>You may ask, did this person stay in some rundown old hotel constructed during the 
Mexican revolution. No, we stayed at a Sheraton Hotel built about 4 years ago. Did they go into the jungle 
to explore ruins? No, we stayed in and around the City. Did they eat at some questionable roadside stand? 
No, we ate only at nice table clothed restaurants. <BR> 
                   <DD> Well then, where did he get it from? My best guess is that I got it from swimming in 
Acapulco bay. The Sheraton Hotel isn't even located downtown where the water may be affected by some 
unknown runoff of pollutants or excrement. It is situated on the periphery of Acapulco with a beautiful 
nighttime view from the second story lobby and third story restaurant.<BR> 
                   <DD>Don't be fooled by pretty scenery or marvelous views. I will never go back to 
Acapulco.<p><center><font size=+1><B> I suggest that you be cafeful !</B></font> </center><P>
<center><HR></center><P>
<H2>Do You Have Something To Add ?</H2>
       <DD>If you have something you want to share with others about Acapulco, then <A HREF="mailto:Acapulco@VisitorInfo.com">email me </A>. We'll post it here !<BR>

Public relations produced a hefty 235 percent return on investment, according to chief economic officers across the country who were polled by the International Association of Business Communicators Research Foundation in 1990.
<P><DD>
Results of a survey conducted in 1991 by Soft.letter, a newsletter based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that covers trends in the computer software industry; show "the software industry as a whole has come to rely heavily on public relations as a marketing tool. Especially in smaller companies, PR is likely to be a major investment area and is often viewed as a low-cost alternative to magazine advertising." Publicity is taking on a more important role with many consumer companies selling broad based products as well.
<P><DD>
Publicity is important because it is the only part of the marketing program that builds credibility. Many industries are blessed with innovative, yet unknown start-up companies. For these start-up companies to rise above their competitors, it's essential that they build credibility through publicity. Credibility is the key to winning consumers' minds, hearts and pocketbooks.

Here are some examples:<P>

<LI>	When PC Week columnist Jim Seymour praised Revolution Software's VGA Dimmer, a software program that saves the screen from burning out, readers jammed the phone lines with orders for several weeks.
<P>
<LI>	When New York Times writer Peter Lewis wrote about Eye Relief, a large type word processor from SkiSoft Publishing Corporation, the article was syndicated to 12 newspapers in large cities, leading to orders from across the country.

<P><LI>	When American Express introduced their Platinum Cards, they relied only on publicity from newspaper and magazine business columnists. They received eight times the response they hoped for even though the card carried a $300 membership fee, which is more than 15 times the $18 fee charged by many other credit cards.
<P><LI>	When Commodore International introduced the Amiga Computer in 1985, the returned registration cards showed that 87 percent of the early buyers said they bought the computer based on public relations in the form of reviews and news articles they had read. PR was far more effective than the other choices: advertising and salespersons' suggestions. The Amiga is now a favorite in the video industry because publicity drove early sales.
</UL></UL></UL><DD>
Advertising, direct mail and the advice of salespersons have long been viewed as effective ways to sell products. Public relations also commands respect because it can increase sales by supporting advertising efforts and increasing direct mail responses.<P>

<H2>Benefits of Public Relations Compared to Advertising</H2><P><DD>

Public relations differs from advertising in that advertising controls the message, while PR does not. Because of this distinction, PR creates credibility. Advertising by itself can't create credibility. When readers see an ad, they sometimes think, "Big deal, that's what THEY say." Skeptical readers are more apt to believe independent authorities - reporters, columnists, reviewers or broadcasters who lend credibility to products and services in their newspaper columns, magazine reviews, and television shows. These independent authorities are influenced by public relations activities.
<P><DD>
Public relations helps advertising by creating credibility for a product or service.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Publicists wanted $1,300 to write a press release for Aaron

Parnell; with Publicity-Builder, he created his own and got big results.<BR>

<BR>

...PublicityBuilder adds tools for managing an entire publicity campaign.<BR>

<I>- Janet Attard, Home PC, October 1995</I><BR>

<BR>

<BR>

No need to reinvent the wheel or face writers block because PublicityBuilder

contains well-designed templates that get you going and on track. In addition

there is an accompanying Reference Guide that contains just about all the

information you will need for making an informed choice on launching a publicity

campaign.<BR>

<BR>

Bottom line: PublicityBuilder enables you to create a positive impression

to the media of your choice, whether it's the phone, in person, through

the mail or trade shows. The benefit is positioning your company, products,

and services to impress reporters to write about them.<BR>

<I>- Eugene F. Marotta, Fatbits, August 1995</I><BR>

<BR>

<BR>

According to the most recent Home Office Computing Reader Poll, a healthy

percentage of small businesses and home-office workers are looking to improve

their public relations savvy everything from getting their names

out before the public to dealing with reporters. Jian's PublicityBuilder

is one of the few packages that addresses this need.<BR>

<BR>

PublicityBuilder's greatest strength is defining what good publicity is

and the frame of mind needed to create a successful campaign. Publicity

is more than just how well you write a letter to a local reporter; it includes

your attitude and focus, and lessons on these topics are sprinkled throughout

the book.<BR>

<BR>

The examples of press releases and pitch letters to the media are excellent

starting points for developing your own campaign. The letters cover several

situations, from business events and personnel announcements to product

upgrades and new services, so you can easily fit your particulars in the

templates or alter them to your needs.<BR>

<BR>

<I>- Drew Reid Kerr, Home Office Computing, April 1995</I><BR>

<BR>

<BR>

A little publicity can mean a lot for any business, but before you drop

$100 an hour on a public relations firm, consider a one-time payment of

$129. JIAN's PublicityBuilder puts public relations wisdom in a box. An

easy-reading manual explains what you need to know and offers samples of

press releases, letters and work sheets for implementing your publicity

campaign. <BR>

<BR>

Files come in several formats and can be read by most word processors. This

could be the best spent $129 in '95.<BR>

You can let this software be your advertising agent. Publicity Builder is

a simple program designed to help business people learn how to &quot;harness

the power of the media.&quot; It points out the value of publicity. It teaches

you how to get it. <BR>

<I>- Phyllis Miller, Manatee Root Directory, February 1995<BR>

</I><BR>

<BR>

&quot;We also used the PublicityBuilder. . . . When we went to shows, we

didn't have anything to tell us what to be doing preparing for the show,

how to make a press kit. When you came home from the show, what's the best

way to do follow up.&quot;<BR>

<UL><LI> A naturally occurring antioxidant, contains the special bioflavonoid, Quercetin along with a complete array of other bioflavonoids.  <LI>Also known as Ubiquinone, is a potent, naturally occurring antioxidant contained in goodly amounts in healthy bodies.  <LI>Necessary for the energy production responsible for our life processes.  It is a component of every cell in the body, and as its levels drop, so does our general status of health.  <LI>Low levels can result in many problems including: high blood pressure, heart attack, angina, immune system depression, periodontal disease, general lack of energy and obesity.  It has been shown to extend life in laboratory animals when supplemented in their diets.  
<LI>University studies have shown that some overweight people have a tendency to have low levels of CO-Q.  As individuals require more energy, more Co-Enzyme Q-10 is needed.  Tissues that need the largest 
amount of Co-Enzyme Q-10 are those that require the most energy, such as the heart.  <LI>Our ability to produce Co-Enzyme Q-10 decreases as we age, so we need to supplement with it to ensure prevention of conditions that may develop because of a lack of it.

<a href="http://www.winzip.com">winzip.com</a><P><DD> WinZip 6.2, just released, supports
UUencoded, BinHex, and MIME files.  The
new WinZip Self-Extractor Personal
Edition simplifies file distribution by
allowing users to create executable
files that unzip themselves.  WinZip's
"Favorite Zip Folders" facility
organizes downloads and all other Zip
files into one convenient list that is
sorted by date, making it easier to
locate all Zip files, regardless of
where they came from or where they are
stored.<BR><DD>Other Features include:<UL><LI>
Windows 95 support, including tight
integration with the Windows 95 shell.
<LI>Internet Support:  built-in support for
popular Internet file formats (TAR,
gzip, UUencode, XXencode, BinHex, MIME,
and Unix compress).
<LI>WinZip Wizard:  this optional feature
uses the standard and familiar "wizard"
interface to simplify the process of
unzipping and installing software
distributed in Zip files.

They originally came from the National Archives and Record Administration. I

Congress "American Memory Collection". These photographs first appeared in

the series "Color Photographs from the Farm Security Administration and the

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Empowering an Organization
with Effective Performance Reviews</FONT></B><P>
<FONT SIZE="-1">(An Austin-Hayne White Paper)</FONT>
<P><DD>
<I><B>Few things</B></I> in business life provoke the anxiety associated
with job performance reviews. Whether employee or manager, receiving
and writing appraisals can be a stressful experience. <P><DD>
A survey of 3,500 employees documented this experience, citing
performance appraisals as the most-complained-about of the work
situation (cited by Herbert H. Meyer, <I>Academy of Management
Executives Journal</I>, February 1991).<P><DD>
Employees, managers and companies suffer when employees fail to
receive the guidance needed to improve job performance. Corporations
also face legal exposure when a termination decision involves
a worker who had received &quot;satisfactory&quot; or &quot;very
good&quot; appraisals in times past, even if the manager had awarded
such ratings for fear of hurt feelings.<P><DD>
It's not just large firms that have to worry about performance
reviews. Whether it's a start-up aiming for the stars, or a corporation
&quot;right-sizing&quot; to meet competitive demands, any kind
of organization needs to empower its people to maintain a competitive
edge. An effective, enlightening performance review system can
be key to delivering a higher level of employee performance and
commitment.<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Present Situation</FONT></B>
<P><DD>
A 1993 survey conducted by the Society of Human Resources
Management (SHRM) and Development Dimensions International (DDI)
showed that both those writing the appraisals and the appraised
were unhappy with the process. In specific, managers want a better
structure for preparing reviews and for aligning performance management
with other organizational systems.
<P><DD>
Number one on the wish list for employees is a sense
of balance. Reviews, they said, should emphasize not only results
but also the skills and behaviors used to achieve those results.
Employees want more information included in their reviews in order
to work with managers on common goals.<P><DD>
For both sides, the most common complaint about the performance
review process is the lack of effective feedback and coaching.
In the SHRM/DDI survey, this aspect received the lowest ranking
of any element in the process.<P><DD>
&quot;Without effective feedback and coaching, a performance management
system is a goal setting and review process without a heart,&quot;
one summary of the SHRM/DDI poll stated. &quot;Feedback and coaching
should drive a system.&quot;<P><DD>
According to a study of 200 companies, conducted by Psychological
Associates, 70 percent of the employees said they were more confused
than enlightened by the performance appraisal feedback they got
from managers.<P><DD>
Besides confusion and damaged morale, a poorly prepared employee
review can also create costly legal exposure. As costly as $773,000
-- the average U.S. award in wrongful termination cases, according
to the Bureau of National Affairs. In addition to the long-standing
problem of justifying the dismissal of an employee who had received
good evaluations in times past, legal actions based on age and
gender-related issues are also on the rise. Wrongful termination
cases have increased more than a hundred-fold during the period
from 1982 to 1992, with employees winning 64 percent of such cases
brought before a jury.<P><DD>
Clearly managers, employees and companies can all become more
successful if clear, effective feedback is provided to employees.
Employees benefit from having a better sense of direction in their
careers, concrete data on which to base their goals, and the guidance
that will help them become more successful. For managers, the
pluses include a definitive framework for reviews and the ability
to use situational coaching to guide employees towards mutually
satisfying goals. Companies will reap the benefits of a more focused
and productive work force, as well as increased protection from
legal actions related to carelessly prepared reviews.<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>A Software Solution</FONT></B>
<P><DD>
Today's generation of <B>management support software
</B>allows users to tap into the knowledge base of leading corporate
experts at a low cost. Austin-Hayne's combination of software
development expertise and management consulting experience makes
the company uniquely qualified to bring the Employee Appraiser
to market. Employee Appraiser is currently available for
Microsoft Windows on the PC and a Macintosh version.<P><DD>
Employee Appraiser uses an intuitive approach to match
descriptive phrases, selected by the user, to a paragraph that
accurately describes the given situation.<P><DD>
Should a manager select the phrase, &quot;makes snap decisions&quot;,
to describe an employee's decision making skills, the program
will suggest, &quot;Robert often makes decisions before carefully
considering options and consequences. As a result, he spends time
correcting errors and misunderstanding that could have been avoided.
Robert would improve the quality of his decisions by taking the
time to outline information sources and review alternatives.&quot;
<BR>
A manager can then use the text as is or, with the click of a
button, have the program &quot;fine tune&quot; the wording to
be cast either in a more positive or more directive tone. This
gives managers a significant head start towards writing the narrative
portion of a performance review.<P><DD>
With Employee Appraiser, finding the right words is not
limited to the employee review. Unlike other review-writing software,
it contains a coaching advisor which helps both the manager and
the employee handle specific performance issues covered in the
review.<P><DD>
Moving directly from the writing example they have chosen in the
review-writing mode, the manager can quickly pull up specific
suggestions for improving that particular performance area. Suggestions
for the employee are written in an informal style so that they
can be dropped directly into the review or paraphrased in a one-on-one
meeting. <P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Expertise at Your Fingertips</FONT></B>
<P><DD>
The knowledge base behind <B>Employee Appraiser </B>comes
from several sources not normally available to the average business
person and almost certainly not to an entrepreneur or a manager
of a small business. The ideas used in the performance appraisal
database and the coaching advisor come from experts who have consulted
with American Express Company, Hewlett-Packard Company, Intel
Corporation and Xerox Corporation, among others.<P><DD>
As a result, Employee Appraiser meets the needs of Fortune
500 corporations and smaller companies who have a similar interest
in delivering quality feedback to their employees. From the thought-provoking
&quot;Writing By Example&quot; approach to the Coaching Advisor,
Employee Appraiser shifts the focus from the review writing process to the final review product.<P><DD>
Using the &quot;Writing By Example&quot; approach also involves
this expert advice in a fashion which might otherwise be overlooked.
By leading the user from general performance areas, e.g.,
&quot;Initiative&quot;,
to a list of specific descriptions of performance problems, the
program helps the manager drill down to the underlying issues
and develop effective solutions. In essence, the manager learns
from the knowledge base as they prepare an appraisal.
<P><DD>
For those who receive evaluations written with the
help of Employee Appraiser, there are substantial benefits
as well. Issues are clearly expressed in a language that does
not injure the employee's morale, and specific coaching is provided
for areas where improvement is desired. And all of this is done
with a precision and perspective that can eliminate personal animus
and prejudice from a presentation.
<P><DD>
To ensure the information contained in Employee
Appraiser conforms with the letter and spirit of current labor
law, Austin-Hayne worked Bernadette Davison Bantly, a labor and
employment attorney with Thelen, Marrin, Johnson &amp; Bridges,
to screen the suggestions used. Of course, no software program
can substitute for legal counsel when necessary, nor does Austin-Hayne
market the program towards that end.<P><DD>
Employee Appraiser offers the elements that employees,
managers and their companies desire: clear appraisals, a rich
base of knowledge, expert coaching and a system which is integrated
with today's dominant business technology: the personal computer.
As management support software continues to evolve and grow, Employee
Appraiser points the way towards progress and satisfaction
in the workplace.<P><DD>

<H3> Review</H3>
<P><DD> Watch cute elbow macaroni dance and sing! This high quality screen saver has
 beautiful artwork and 3D rendered macaroni. (Look for the hidden Easter Egg in the About
                                     box too!). You can also vary the number of little people doing the dance step, from a solo act to a whole cloned room full. 
<P><DD>Operates nicely on a 486/25.<P><DD>Installs automatically into the standard Windows desktop screensaver grouging without hassle and with minimal human intereaction<P><DD>Suggest a sound card for a full effect.

My name is Mary-Anna, I'm an elbow macaroni<BR>

People say I'm better than a bowl of fried bologna.<BR>

They all want me<BR>

I'm so tasty<BR>

So they boil, strain and eat me.<BR><BR>

Rigatoni, Fettuccine, Ziti or Spaghetti,<BR>

Ravioli, Manicotti, Shells or Tortellini,<BR>

Macaroni is the best when it's cooked aldente'.<BR>

<H2>I First Heard Macarena when ..... </H2></center><P>

<DD>I was in Acapulco in Feb 1995. Everyone was singing and dancing to this song I'd never heard before. I loved the beat ! I assumed it was an old song and that I had missed hearing it back home.<BR><DD>The funniest time I saw it played in Mexico was on one of those midnight "booze cruises" around Acapulco bay . There was a girl who jumped up onto the stage and started dancing and singing to it with one of the band members in front of the whole ship. That was the most fun time I had in Acapulco.<BR><DD>My parting memory of Acapulco was the vision of some airport vendor serving customers while swaying to the rhythm of the beat of Macarena.<BR><UL><UL><UL><UL><UL><I>R.M. from Green Bay, Wi.</I></UL></UL></UL></UL></UL><P>

<h1 align="center">The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program Overview</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program is part of <a
href="HPS.htm">Health Promotion Services</a> of the Health
Department of Western Australia. Health Promotion Services
conducts healthy promotion programs which aim to encourage
Western Australians to adopt healthier lifestyles. The Alcohol
and Other Drugs Program has responsibility for the following
areas: Alcohol, Illicit Drug and Medicinal Drug Education.</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program undertakes programs that
use a broad range of strategies enabling a comprehensive approach
to drug education. Alcohol causes extensive harm in our community
and contributes to a large proportion of deaths and is the main
focus of the Program.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The overall aim of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Program is to
reduce the harm associated with excessive alcohol consumption and
the misuse of other drugs. The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program
adopts a harm minimisation approach to drug use. That is, it
acknowledges that many people use drugs of one type or another,
and operates within a framework of reducing the harm associated
with drug use.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Target Groups</h3>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program establishes priority areas
based on epidemiological evidence, amenability to change and
community acceptability and the necessity for intervention.</p>
<p>Target groups currently include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>School-aged children</li>
    <li>18 to 24-year-olds } those who drink in excess of the
        daily limits recommended by the National Health and
        Medical</li>
    <li>25 to 44-year-olds } Research Council (NHMRC).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program is primarily State
Government-funded but receives funding from the Commonwealth
Government through the National Drug Strategy (NDS). No fees are
charged for services and programs provided to the community.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Activities and Services</h3>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program uses a variety of
strategies to meet its objectives, including the use of mass
media; production of information and promotional materials;
community and school education; sponsorship activities; policy
formulation; encouraging health professionals involvement in
alcohol and drug education; and a range of programs for specific
target groups.</p>
<p>In 1994/95 the Alcohol and Other Drugs Program conducted three
major media-based campaigns, a statewide conference on the Review
of the Liquor Licensing Act and ten training programs for drug
educators. In addition, more than 10,000 printed resources were
developed and distributed, and 100 people trained to deliver a
sleep and insomnia course. </p>
<hr>
<h3>Campaigns and Programs</h3>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program aims to reduce
alcohol-related disease, injury and harm through the promotion of
low-risk alcohol consumption. The social and health problems
caused by alcohol are the focus of the 1995/96 Drinksafe
campaign, to reflect the new Commonwealth campaign for national
alcohol education, named Alcohol - Go Easy. The second phase of
the national campaign will draw attention to levels of alcohol
use which are considered to be low-risk, and aims to promote the
monitoring of alcohol use through the standard drink labelling of
alcohol beverage containers. </p>
<p>A Health Department report showed a slight increase in the per
capita alcohol consumption in Western Australia from 1991/92 to
1992/93. The average state consumption was 10.92 litres of
absolute alcohol. This increase is set in the context of a
downward trend in the average consumption for Western Australians
over the ten year period 1981/91. &#160;</p>
<p>The Drinksafe Campaign is a long-term state government
initiative. This campaign aims to reduce alcohol-related illness,
injury and death in Western Australia among 25 to 44-year-olds.</p>
<p>The Respect Yourself Campaign aims to increase safe levels of
alcohol consumption among 18 to 24-year-olds and reduce the
alcohol-related harm of this age group.</p>
<p>The Rural Alcohol Campaign is a part of the Respect Yourself
Campaign. The campaign is specific to 18 to 24-year-olds in the
Kimberley, Pilbara, Goldfields and Midwest regions of Western
Australia, who drink excessively.</p>
<p>The Youth Program aims to reduce alcohol-related harm and
delay the onset of alcohol use among school-aged children. This
program also focuses on Community Drug Education initiatives and
adopts a comprehensive approach to drug education.</p>
<p>The Medicinal and Illicit Drug Education Program aims to
reduce individual and community harm associated with drug use.
The Medicinal and Illicit Drug Education Program adopts a harm
minimisation approach to drug use.</p>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program liaises with a range of
health professionals including Regional Health Promotion Officers
in metropolitan and country areas. The Program works with Health
Department, Public Health Units and Health Services to plan,
implement and evaluate community alcohol and drug initiatives</p>
<p>Assistance is provided to people who want to change their
drug-use behaviour or want to understand or help others to change
their drug-use behaviour. This help is offered in the form of
self-help materials or referral to Alcohol and Other Drug
Information Service (ADIS) or other agencies and health
professionals.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Research and Evaluation</h3>
<p>Evaluation of program strategies is undertaken by the Alcohol
and Other Drugs Program to determine their effectiveness and to
assist in the planning of future interventions. Alcohol
consumption data is also collected periodically to monitor trends
of use in both adults, young people and school-aged children.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Other Organisations</h3>
<p>The Alcohol and Other Drugs Program works with a range of
other government and non-government agencies to minimise harm
associated with alcohol and other drug use in Western Australia.
These include the Western Australian Alcohol and Drug Authority,
Alcohol Advisory Council of WA, National Centre for Research into
the Prevention of Drug Abuse, Education Department of Western
Australia and School Health Coalition. The Program liaises with
agencies concerned with alcohol and other drug use in other
states and countries.</p>

<p>The School Health Promotion Program is part of the <a
href="Alcohol.htm">Alcohol and Other Drugs Program</a>, <a
href="HPS.htm">Health Promotion Services</a>. The School Health
Promotion Program aims to develop a comprehensive approach to
health in schools that includes: effective classroom programs;
healthy schools environments; and more effective school and
community interaction that promotes the health of school-aged
children. While the main emphasis of the program is drug
education, some strategies address other health issues such as
nutrition, mental health, HIV/AIDS, sexuality education and
injury prevention. </p>
<p>Since 1992, the School Health Promotion Program has provided
training, consultation and technical support to Health Department
regions. The Program has developed resources, conducted training
programs and provided technical assistance to schools and Health
Authorities. Advocacy for school health promotion is also a key
activity of the program with the aim of maintaining and fostering
an environment within schools that promotes health. Evaluation to
date shows that there is a continuing need for this type of
support. </p>
<p>The Community Drug Education Program provides a range of drug
education activities to increase knowledge, attitudes and skills
of parents and other community members in dealing with youth drug
use issues. </p>
<p>The overall goal of the School Health Promotion Program and
the Community Drug Education Program is to reduce the harm
associated with alcohol and other drug use among school-aged
children in Western Australia by reducing the number of young
people who experiment and regularly use alcohol and other drugs. </p>
<p>In 1995/96 the Youth Campaign was created and combined the
School Health Promotion Program and the Community Drug Education
Program. These programs were combined to enhance the development
of a comprehensive approach to alcohol and other drug education
in the school community. </p>

<h3><a name="INTRODUCTION"><font color="#004080">INTRODUCTION</font></a></h3>
<p>The extent of alcohol use and abuse in our community, the harm
caused by the abuse of alcohol and the social and economic costs
are concerns for both the community and the individual. This is a
guide for individuals, groups or organisations within your
community that want to reduce the effects of alcohol-related
problems. </p>
<p>Western Australian communities are affected by alcohol-related
problems. These problems include drink driving cases involving
vehicle crashes, loss of life or injury and assaults, vandalism
and excessive noise emanating from places where alcohol is being
consumed. </p>
<p>Alcohol ranks second only to tobacco as the major cause of
drug-related deaths in Australia. In 1992, in Australia, it is
estimated that hazardous and harmful use of alcohol caused the
loss of 4,139 lives and 69,992 person-years of life lost before
70 years. </p>
<p>It was also estimated that alcohol accounted for 24% of the
total social costs attributable to drug abuse in Australia. This
amounts to a total of $4.5 billion. Proportionally, for the
Western Australian population, this would mean an annual cost of
approximately $450 million. </p>
<p>Community groups and concerned individuals can take action to
help reduce alcohol-related problems. In addition, local
government authorities are also developing policies as an
integral part of their plans to reduce alcohol-related problems. </p>
<p>This booklet is primarily about measures to control the
excessive consumption of alcohol and is produced in response to
community interest and requests for information. The resource
should be seen as fitting within a broader context of education,
cooperation and other environmental strategies which could
influence the problems associated with people drinking too much. </p>
<p>Information about other alcohol-related issues, such as
personal behaviour, are addressed within publications produced by
Health Promotion Services and can be obtained by telephoning (09)
222 2045. </p>
<p>The emphasis throughout this booklet is on cooperation, not
opposition, as problems within communities will often be solved
through groups working together in a coordinated and
collaborative way. Solving, reducing or preventing the problems a
community experiences with excessive alcohol consumption will
ultimately rely on the sensible behaviour of individuals, groups
and organisations within communities. </p>
<p>This publication, developed by Health Promotion Services,
Health Department of Western Australia, is one in a series of
three booklets about reducing alcohol-related problems in the
community. </p>

<h3><a name="WHY_IS_COMMUNITY_ACTION"><font color="#004080">WHY
IS COMMUNITY ACTION IMPORTANT?</font></a></h3>
<p>Alcohol-related problems have many forms. Some examples are
drink driving, property damage, violence, abuse, noise,
rubbish/litter and other offensive behaviour. Everyone has the
right to voice their concerns about the immediate consequences of
the excessive consumption of alcohol. As an individual, you may
feel that your voice alone will not accomplish anything. This is
not the case. </p>
<p>The coming together of individual concerns can lead to the
formation of groups working to better their communities. The
approach should be cooperative: this means genuine cooperation
not only with various organisations in the community, but also
where possible with the liquor industry. People forming these
cooperative groups have a combined power that will magnify their
effect. </p>
<p>If you are concerned by the number of vehicle crashes
occurring on the roads, or any other alcohol-related issue, you
can take action! </p>

<h3><a name="WHAT_IS_THE_CAUSE"><font color="#004080">WHAT IS THE
CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM?</font></a></h3>
<p>The excessive consumption of alcohol is associated with a
variety of problems that affects communities and places a strain
on the services, such as hospitals and police, that are provided
within these communities. </p>
<p>The consumption of alcohol is generally not seen as a problem
for most people. In fact, drinking at modest levels is recognised
to confer benefits for cardio-vascular disease. </p>
<p>However, drinking too much can have immediate and negative
effects on a person and the community. It can result in behaviour
that endangers the safety of the drinker and others, offends and
disrupts other people, and has serious health and social effects
on the drinker. </p>
<p>People drink too much alcohol for many different reasons. Some
people intentionally choose to drink too much, others act on
impulse and others are not aware of the negative consequences of
drinking too much. Drinking to excess can place someone at
greater risk of injury due to impaired motor coordination, or
result in behaviour that is socially offensive or disruptive. </p>
<p>Drinking occurs in a variety of different environments within
a community. People choose to drink at home, friends' houses,
parties, hotels, restaurants, sporting clubs, picnics and other
outdoor venues. When someone drinks too much, then problems can
occur at the venue, which can then be seen by the community as
being the source of the problem. </p>
<p>Western Australia has laws that govern the consumption of
alcohol. These laws include the prohibition of drinking alcohol
in public places. However, the police will generally only
intervene when people are being disorderly. Other laws govern the
practices of licensed premises, acknowledging the need to control
the sale and supply of alcohol within the community. Local
government and the Health Department all have regulatory
responsibilities relating to alcohol. </p>

<h3><a name="WHAT_CAN_BE_DONE"><font color="#004080">WHAT CAN BE
DONE ABOUT THE PROBLEM?</font></a></h3>
<p><strong>Alcohol-related harm in the community can best be
reduced by influencing consumer demand and the supply of alcohol. </strong></p>
<p>One way to influence the problems associated with drinking too
much is to look at the issue in terms of demand and supply. </p>
<p>That is, people want or demand alcohol, and alcohol is sold or
supplied by a variety of other people, including friends,
function hosts, licensees and manufacturers. </p>
<p>Influencing alcohol demand can be achieved by education to
increase understanding of alcohol and its use, and change
people's acceptance of excessive alcohol consumption. School,
public, healthsite, workplace and server education are all
important contributors to educating the community about the use
of alcohol. The provision of alternative activities can reduce
excessive alcohol consumption. The objective is to provide people
with the opportunity to make an informed choice about drinking. </p>
<p>Alcohol supply can be regulated through placing restrictions
on drinking ages to reduce excessive alcohol consumption, and
enforcing alcohol-related laws. The police, local governments,
the Health Department, the Liquor Licensing Division and
licensees all have a vested interest in seeing the various laws
are enforced. </p>
<p>The supply of alcohol can also be influenced through the price
and promotion of alcohol. Special drink offers, cheap drinks and
drinking competitions are associated with excessive consumption.
People are more likely to purchase non- and low- alcohol
alternatives, and become less intoxicated, if these drinks are
provided at prices that offer a substantial price difference. </p>
<p>The removal or replacement of incentives to excessively
consume alcohol is another way to reduce problems in a community. </p>
<p>Social hosts, serving staff and licensees can affect the level
of intoxication by their serving practices. Some simple practices
can help, including providing water, making sure food is
available, not topping up glasses, monitoring friends and
customers' consumption to limit their levels of intoxication and
not supplying alcohol to juveniles. </p>
<p>The availability of alcohol is also associated with excessive
consumption. The number and density of places that can supply
alcohol and the hours when alcohol can be supplied are issues
that might concern a community. Parties, functions requiring
occasional licences, special and ordinary licences contribute to
the availability of alcohol. Influencing availability and the
good order of a community can be achieved through the cooperation
of all parties. However, if this fails, laws exist to regulate
alcohol availability and the operation of the alcohol providers
so as to reduce problems associated with excessive alcohol
consumption. </p>

<h3><a name="PUBLIC_EDUCATION"><font color="#004080">PUBLIC
EDUCATION</font></a></h3>
<p>A Health Department survey of six rural and remote Western
Australian towns reported that alcohol-related harm and
disruption was the greatest social problem within those
communities. Increasing public awareness of the social and health
problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption can motivate
people to bring about change within their community. People
drinking too much alcohol is a major drain on the resources of
many community services including those of health professionals,
police, social workers and religious organisations. </p>
<p><font color="#004080"><strong>Who can you go to for advice?</strong></font></p>
<p>Rotary and Lions Service Clubs of Western Australia have
identified alcohol and other drugs as a priority issue for
action. Local clubs assist communities to reduce alcohol-related
harm. Health Department health promotion officers and
community-based nurses have also made alcohol-related harm a
priority issue. </p>
<p>A call to any of these agencies will establish their
willingness to support community action. Health promotion
officers are trained and actively involved in the delivery of
health information to communities. Community-based police
officers can also support community groups wanting to know more
about alcohol-related harm. </p>
<p>Drug and alcohol workers are excellent sources of information
on alcohol. </p>
<p>The Health Department Respect Yourself and Drinksafe campaigns
provide media campaigns, publications and other materials,
including this booklet, to raise community awareness and
understanding about a variety of alcohol issues for men and
women, adults and children. This information is available through
most community health and public health centres or by contacting
the number listed in the back of this booklet. </p>
<p>The Alcohol Advisory Council is a non-government organisation
that provides assistance to community groups. The Council
promotes the prevention of alcohol-related harm. Monitoring and
responding to issues associated with the alcohol industry and
consumers is its primary role. </p>

<h3><a name="SCHOOL_EDUCATION"><font color="#004080">SCHOOL
EDUCATION</font></a></h3>
<p>Research shows that 90 per cent of young people will have
experimented with alcohol by 17 years. The research also showed
46 per cent of 17 year-olds had consumed alcohol in the past
week. Given the importance of prevention and early intervention
in reducing the problems associated with drinking too much,
schools are clearly an appropriate setting in which to lay the
foundations of alcohol education. </p>
<p>To be effective, alcohol education should be part of a
comprehensive drug education program. Furthermore, for drug
education to be effective it should be: </p>
<ul>
    <li>a mandatory part of the school curriculum; </li>
    <li>taught as a discrete and specified component of health
        education courses; </li>
    <li>taught consistently throughout a school student's
        education career; </li>
    <li>adequately supported through teacher training,
        professional development of teachers, and curriculum
        materials; and </li>
    <li>based on the WA Education Department's Health Education
        K-10 Syllabus, complemented by appropriate mandatory
        school policies on drugs. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Action</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact your local school's parents and citizens' group
        to check if the school has a comprehensive drug education
        program in place for students. Local health promotion
        officers can offer assistance to schools in developing a
        program. </li>

<h3><a name="ALTERNATIVE_ACTIVITIES"><font color="#004080">ALTERNATIVE
ACTIVITIES</font></a></h3>
<p>A way to reduce the problems associated with excessive alcohol
consumption is to conduct activities that remove alcohol as the
primary focus. Music, dancing, games and other entertainment
provide alternatives to people at venues where alcohol is served. </p>
<p>Alcohol-free events and other activities in communities
provide alternatives to people who might otherwise complain of
boredom and choose to drink for the lack of something else to do. </p>
<p>Raising community awareness about activities informs people
who otherwise might not have known about the opportunity.
Providing alternative activities for people who would ordinarily
drink excessively within the community can also help. </p>
<p><strong><i>Action</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Publicise the availability of activities that you or a
        group may be organising. </li>
    <li>Promote ideas for activities that are low-cost and
        accessible. </li>
    <li>Work with a local drug action group and licensees to
        provide other activities at licensed venues. </li>
    <li>Talk with organisers of events where alcohol will be
        served about the lay-out and program. This can result in
        alcohol not becoming the focus of activity. </li>

<p>Private functions such as parties, drinks after work,
barbecues, dinner parties and `just having a few friends around'
are usually good fun. There are a few things a host can do to
make sure people have a good time, that everyone gets home
safely, and the neighbours are still happy the day after. </p>
<p>A host can be held liable if a guest is injured or injures
another person while intoxicated. Hosts include home owners,
employers or owners of commercial establishments. </p>
<p>Talking with the host is a useful starting point if you are
the neighbour and have a problem with a private function due to
the behaviour of the guests. If hosting a function, seek the
assistance and cooperation of people attending your function.

<h3><a name="LICENSED_VENUES"><font color="#004080">LICENSED
VENUES</font></a></h3>
<p>People usually think of a hotel or nightclub when licensed
venues are mentioned. However, the term applies to all holders of
a liquor licence, who have been granted permission to sell or
supply alcohol. Parties where alcohol is sold, sporting clubs,
liquor stores, licensed restaurants and some entertainment venues
are also licensed venues. </p>
<p>Excessive alcohol consumption can occur in most venues where
alcohol is available, licensed or unlicensed. Hotel, club and
restaurant licensees have been joining with other community
groups in an effort to reduce the problems associated with
excessive alcohol consumption. These licensees recognise they are
an important part of the solution to these problems. </p>
<p>Some of the practices being addressed by licensees include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>not serving alcohol to people who are intoxicated </li>
    <li>preventing juveniles' access to licensed premises and the
        supply of alcohol </li>
    <li>the elimination of practices that induce people to drink
        too much, such as <br>
        - happy hours, price discounting, `shooter' promotions,
        drinking competitions; <br>
        - providing spirits as half measures as well as full
        measures; <br>
        - not passing on pricing differentials for low-alcohol
        beers; and <br>
        - offering substantial discounts for bulk buys of
        alcohol, such as `two for one'. </li>
</ul>
<p>Any holder of a liquor licence has obligations under the
Liquor Licensing Act, 1988. These include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>not selling or supplying alcohol to an intoxicated
        (drunk) person; </li>
    <li>ensuring the quiet or good order of a neighbourhood is
        not frequently disturbed by activity occurring at the
        licensed premises or by patrons in the vicinity of the
        premises; and </li>
    <li>not allowing the sale or supply of alcohol to people aged
        under 18. </li>
</ul>
<p>Having to refuse service to an intoxicated person is a common
problem for serving staff. Many patrons are not aware of a
licensee's and their own obligations under the Liquor Licensing
Act. </p>
<p>The Liquor Licensing Act allows any legitimate complaint to be
lodged where: </p>
<ul>
    <li>the amenity, quiet or good order of the neighbourhood is
        frequently disturbed by activity occurring in licensed
        premises; or </li>
    <li>any of the following are unduly offensive, annoying,
        disturbing or inconvenient: <br>
        - behaviour of patrons of licensed premises; <br>
        - noise emanating from premises; or <br>
        - disorderly conduct occurring in the vicinity of
        licensed premises caused by those who have been at the
        same licensed premises. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Liquor Licensing Act recommends people keep a record of
all instances of noise and disturbances specifying type of noise,
date and time and duration of the disturbance. </p>
<p><font color="#004080"><strong>Who can you approach to raise
your concerns?</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><i>The Licensee</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The licensee may be unaware of community members' concerns and
should be consulted. Problems can not be fixed if the licensee is
unaware of any difficulties. It is in their interest to reach a
settlement which satisfies everyone. </p>
<p>The Liquor Licensing Act requires a person with a complaint to
take any legitimate concern to the licensee. If a satisfactory
resolution can not be reached then the Act allows for the
Director of Liquor Licensing to become involved. </p>
<p>Licensed sporting clubs have management committees. These
committees can be approached when problems arise. </p>

local government councils/shires, or the Director of Liquor
Licensing about issues such as service to intoxicated or underage
drinkers, loud noise, or continuous behaviour that is disruptive
to the neighbourhood. </p>
<p>Objections to the establishment of new licensed premises or
the practices of an existing licence can be made to the Director
of Liquor Licensing. </p>
<p>There are conditions which apply to making complaints. Advice
about the procedure is available from the Liquor Licensing
Division, the Alcohol Advisory Council or local government
authorities. </p>
<p>Local councils and shires can also represent community members
and licensees in an attempt to resolve problems. Many local
government authorities are developing alcohol policies which aim
to reduce alcohol-related harm within their municipalities (for
more information refer to the section on local government
initiatives). </p>
<p><strong><i>Action</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Discuss your concerns with individual licensees or the
        local licensees' group. </li>
    <li>Encourage licensed premises/sporting clubs to actively
        participate in local alcohol accords. </li>

<p>Excessive alcohol consumption can affect the workplace through
injury, job loss, loss of productivity, and equipment and
property damage. The workplace can contribute to improving
alcohol-related problems in the community through workplace
policy and practices. </p>
<p>Larger workplaces have Occupational, Safety and Health
(OS&amp;H) representatives who have developed and implemented

<h3><a name="ALCOHOL_ACCORDS"><font color="#004080">ALCOHOL
ACCORDS</font></a></h3>
<p>Alcohol accords are community initiatives primarily involving
local government, police and licensees. The accords encourage a
range of positive, effective community-based strategies to reduce
problems related to drinking too much alcohol. These initiatives
aim to reduce crime and violence involving intoxicated people. </p>
<p>Alcohol accords were pioneered in Geelong, Victoria, and have
been established in the Eastern States of Australia, Fremantle
and the north of Western Australia. Partners in accords include
licensees, police, local government, local community groups and
the Health Department. The strength of an accord is in the
commitment of the various partners to work together to solve or
prevent problems within a community. Accord agreements are
entered into voluntarily. Their aims include maintaining proper
and ethical conduct within all licensed premises, particularly
through promoting responsible alcohol service. </p>
<p>Alcohol accords are being developed in Western Australian
communities to help address or prevent problems such as street
drinking, property damage, night-time assaults, injury and drink
driving. </p>
<p>Some of the practices adopted within accord agreements
include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>restricting hours of trade; </li>
    <li>restricting drink specials and promotions; </li>
    <li>providing public education about the codes of practice; </li>
    <li>increasing public transport; </li>
    <li>increasing visible and active police surveillance; </li>
    <li>encouraging responsible server practices; and </li>
    <li>ensuring crowd controllers are well-trained. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Action</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If your community has an accord, you may wish to read it.
        If you are interested in encouraging an accord in your
        community, contact your local drug action group, local
        Public Health Unit, licensees, local government
        representatives or police. </li>
    <li>If the practices listed in the accord document are being
        implemented, you can write to the newspaper or ring the
        local radio station and applaud the partners. </li>
    <li>Encourage people experiencing problems because of
        excessive alcohol consumption by others to discuss their
        problems with the accord management group or a
        representative. </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on accords, contact your local police,
Public Health Unit, the Liquor Licensing Division, or the Alcohol
and Other Drugs Program, Health Promotion Services, Health
Department of Western Australia. </p>

<h3><a name="LOCAL_GOVERNMENT"><font color="#004080">LOCAL
GOVERNMENT</font></a><font color="#004080"> ALCOHOL POLICIES</font></h3>
<p>In the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and in
Australia, local government authorities have been seeking to find
solutions to alcohol-related problems in their community through
developing and implementing alcohol policies. </p>
<p>Significant advantages of an alcohol policy to local
governments include the reduction of alcohol-related damage and
disruption within communities and limiting the risk of
councils/shires being sued. </p>
<p>Research over the past 20 years has found a link between
alcohol availability, alcohol consumption and alcohol-related
problems. Local government can reduce alcohol availability
through zoning and planning, by placing conditions on the use of
municipal facilities and leading the community in reducing
alcohol-related problems. </p>
<p>The Fremantle City Council has developed an extensive alcohol
policy. A document outlining the Council's policy is available
from Fremantle City Council or Health Promotion Services, Health
Department of Western Australia, telephone (09) 222 2045. Your
local Public Health Unit will be able to assist with any queries. </p>
<p><strong><i>Action</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Call an environmental health officer or your local
        council/shire elected member to clarify the
        municipality's alcohol policy. </li>
    <li>Encourage local councils/shires to establish their own
        local government alcohol policy. Another booklet in this
        series, <i>A Guide to Developing Local Government Alcohol
        Policy</i>, deals with the development of alcohol
        policies within local government. </li>
    <li>Contact your council if you are having difficulty
        resolving a problem related to excessive alcohol
        consumption. It may be able to help. </li>
    <li>Include your local government authority in initiatives
        requiring cooperation. Shires and councils can often
        provide useful advice and contacts and help identify
        resources for projects. </li>

Alcohol?</font></a></h3>
<p><font color="#400080">The word alcohol comes from the Arabic
`al Kuhul', but no-one knows when it was first used or by whom.
Alcohol is believed to be the oldest and probably the most widely
-used drug in the world. </font></p>
<p><font color="#400080">Alcohol is a drug because it changes the
way you think and feel. Alcohol is a depressant drug that slows
down the brain and the nervous system. </font></p>
<p><font color="#400080">Pure alcohol has no colour or taste. </font></p>
<p><font color="#400080">Alcoholic drinks get their colour and
flavour from the plant ingredients used to make them. The most
common ingredients are malt and hops for beer, malt for whisky,
grapes for wine and champagne, and apples for cider. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0080">Drinks vary in strength. The list below
shows examples of common 'standard drinks.' Each contains about
10 grams of alcohol. </font></p>

<h1 align="center"><font color="#8000FF">Alcohol and Young People
(12-17 years)</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Key Points:</font></h3>
<p>The majority of young people begin their drinking experiences
between the ages of 12 and 14 years. </p>
<p>The majority of young people who drink at hazardous or harmful
levels do so on Fridays and Saturdays. </p>
<p>Young people often drink to get drunk. There is a continuing
prevalence of drinking among young people. </p>
<p>Alcohol is easily available to this age group. </p>
<p>Young people drink for many of the same reasons as adults. </p>
<p>This information has been obtained from a number of research
projects surveying school-aged adolescents (12 - 17 years) who
attend school. </p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Type of Alcohol Consumed </font></h3>
<p>The most popular types of drink consumed by male students are
beer (46%) and spirits (41%). Female students tend to prefer
spirits (48%).<sup>1</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Alcohol Consumption </font></h3>
<p>Approximately 33% of male and 27% of female students between
the ages of 12 - 17 years in Western Australia drank at least
once during the week of the survey. Approximately 66% of these
students are aged 15 years or younger<sup>.1</sup></p>
<p>Of those 12 - 17-year-olds who drank in the last week, 54%
were males and 46% were females<sup>.1</sup></p>
<p>Approximately 90% of students between the ages of 12 - 17
years had experience with alcohol during 1993. Of those students
who has experimented with alcohol, 71% of students had consumed
alcohol in the last 12 months, 44% in the past four weeks and 30%
in the last week.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>By 15 years of age, male current drinkers were consuming, on
average, six drinks per week while females were drinking four. At
age 17 years, male current drinkers were consuming, on average,
nine alcoholic drinks per week, while female current drinkers
consumed, on average, six drinks per week.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The proportion of students who consider themselves to be
non-drinkers decreases steadily with increasing age.
Approximately 71% of male students and 83% of female students at
age 12 years consider themselves to be non-drinkers, while 21% of
males and 28% of females at 17 years claim to be non-drinkers of
alcohol.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>In 1992, the average age for Year 11 students to have started
drinking alcohol was 12.9 years. Males began drinking at 12.6
years, compared with 13.3 years for females.(3) This is
consistent with Western Australian research which indicates that
adolescents begin drinking between 12 - 14 years of age.<sup>4</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Binge Drinking </font></h3>
<p>Ninety seven per cent of alcohol consumption for 12 -
17-year-olds was at low-risk levels from Monday to Thursday but
was at hazardous or harmful levels on Friday (19%), Saturday
(29%) and Sunday (6%).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Being drunk is the expectation in most adolescent drinking
situations.4</p>
<p>Adolescents perceive it to be acceptable to be drunk but
unacceptable to be 'out of control', i.e. vomiting, falling over,
etc.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Since 1989 there has been a continuing high prevalence of
binge drinking among older students; at Year 11, 35% of students
stated that when they drink they usually have at least five
drinks.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Binge drinking (five or more drinks in a row at least once in
a fortnight) increased markedly with each year level. In Year 7,
3% of the students had engaged in binge drinking while by Year
11, this proportion had increased to 37%. </p>
<p>There was a gap of about two years between the age of initial
alcohol use and initial binge drinking occasion for Year 11
students. The average age that Year 11 students first binged was
14.8 years.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The proportion of binge drinkers who planned to drink the
amount they did increased with each year level, from 39% in Year
7 to 67% in Year 11. Males were much more likely to have planned
drinking heavily compared with females. In Year 11, 79% of males,
compared with 51% of females planned to drink as much as they did
on their last binge drinking occasion.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>In one Victorian study students said they stopped drinking:
'When I run out of money', 'When the bottle is empty', 'When I
vomit', 'When I fall over'.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Results of the 1994 Respect Yourself Campaign show that a
number of undesirable beliefs/ attitudes towards alcohol
consumption are apparent among adolescents aged 14 - 17 years
with two out of three agreeing 'it's OK to get drunk every now
and then', almost one in two agreeing that 'there are more good
things about occasionally getting drunk than bad things', and
three out of four indicating that 'most people your age get drunk
fairly regularly'.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The influence of the peer group is also strongly evident:
three in four adolescents believe that 'a drink offered by a
friend should be accepted'.<sup>6</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Morbidity and Mortality </font></h3>
<p>Alcohol is responsible for the majority of drug deaths in
younger persons aged 15 - 34 years (62%). The majority of these
deaths are due to road fatalities and other injuries.<sup>7</sup>
There is no data specific for the 12 - 17 years age group.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Alcohol attributes significantly to hospital admissions, most
commonly from alcohol dependence, strokes, fall injuries, road
crashes and other accidents.<sup>7</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Purchase of Alcohol </font></h3>
<p>Current drinkers tended to obtain their alcohol from parents
(males 33%: females 34%) and also tended to consume it while at
home. The next most frequently nominated source of alcohol
indicated was friends (males 17%: females 22%). By age 16, a
higher proportion of students were purchasing alcohol from
drive-in shops and bottle shops (17%).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The proportion of students who had ever bought or paid for an
alcoholic drink increased steadily from 12% of drinkers in Year 7
to 71% in Year 11. Forty-six percent of Year 11 drinkers usually
bought their own alcohol, and of these 30% usually bought from a
hotel, 33% from a walk-in-bottle shop and 24% from a
drive-in-bottle shop.<sup>3</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Place of Consumption </font></h3>
<p>The most common place for drinking alcohol for both males and
females of all ages is at home (40%), followed by at a party
(28%) and then at a friend's home (12%).<sup>1</sup> This is
consistent with other data.<sup>1,3,4,5</sup></p>
<p>Females aged 15 - 17 years and male students aged 17 years
differed from this pattern. They were more likely to drink at a
party, then at home, then at a friend's home.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>The proportion of both males and females who claim to drink
alcohol at parties increases at 14 years of age (16%) and
continues to rise to approximately 40% of students by the age of
17 years.<sup>2</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Peer and Parental Influence </font></h3>
<p>Students who drink alcohol regularly are more likely to have
someone close to them who also drinks alcohol. Having a friend or
sibling who drinks was the major association although parental
drinking was also a factor.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Some research suggests that students make their own decisions
to drink. Many preferred to have a sober friend who could look
after them at a party; others felt alcohol was too expensive to
give away to friends. The notion of 'peer pressure' can be used
to remove responsibility from students: 'Mum caught me smoking
and drinking, but nothing happened because I told my Mum that
everybody was doing it and she blamed peer pressure' (Year 10
female).<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Students want parents to demonstrate trust and respect, while
at the same time show concern.<sup>4</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">What Students Think About Alcohol </font></h3>
<p>Young people drink for much the same reasons as adults.<sup>4</sup>
This is demonstrated by Western Australian and Victorian
research. </p>
<p>Many students regard drinking as a legitimate pastime and
often as an essential aspect of leisure and entertainment. </p>
<p>Their reasons for drinking include enjoyment, having fun,
relaxation, gaining confidence, and forgetting problems. </p>
<p>Young people's perception of alcohol-related harm includes:
getting into trouble with parents or police; drink-driving;
becoming involved in violence and aggression; being injured, and,
for girls, sexual vulnerability. </p>
<p>Young people feel that it is acceptable to be drunk but not
acceptable to be 'out of control', i.e. vomit and fall over. </p>
<p>Many students who are presently non-drinkers expect to drink
in the future. </p>
<p>Almost half the students surveyed believe they will drink more
in the future then they do now.<sup>4,5</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#8000FF">Students' Knowledge About Alcohol </font></h3>
<p>Students lack knowledge about alcohol and do not know how to
monitor their intake to prevent intoxication. </p>
<p>Alcohol is readily available at most social occasions from
Year 9 onwards. </p>
<p>Friends are a major source of information about alcohol. </p>
<p>Students, including drinkers, lack knowledge of the properties
and effects of alcohol and how it is metabolised.<sup>4,5</sup></p>

<hr>
<h3><font color="#808080">Key Points: </font></h3>
<p>An association exists between alcohol and crime. Violent
offenders have often consumed alcohol prior to the assault. </p>
<p>Enforcing existing liquor laws significantly reduced the
frequency of service to juveniles and intoxicated persons,
thereby reducing alcohol-related harm and crime. </p>
<p>Controls on the price of alcohol and restrictions on the
minimum drinking age have consistently been shown to have an
impact upon alcohol consumption.</p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808080">Alcohol Regulation </font></h3>
<p>Enforcing existing liquor laws significantly reduces the
frequency of service to intoxicated persons, with beneficial
effects on both traffic accidents and assaults.<sup>1,2</sup> </p>
<p>In Australia, a successful case was brought against a licensee
when one customer was assaulted by another who had been permitted
to remain on the premises in a drunken state.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The Supreme Court of New South Wales awarded damages of
$105,526 against a licensee for injury suffered by a patron as a
result of an assault by another patron who was intoxicated,
aggressive and abusive.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Controls on the price of alcohol via taxation and restrictions
on the minimum drinking age have consistently been shown to have
an impact upon alcohol consumption.<sup>4</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808080">Research Findings </font></h3>
<p>The NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research has found
that: </p>
<ul>
    <li>there was correlations between alcohol consumption and
        crime rates </li>
    <li>there is a high incidence and prevalence of alcohol abuse
        in offenders </li>
    <li>a substantial number of offenders use alcohol before
        offending </li>
    <li>many offences are committed on or in the vicinity of
        licensed premises.<sup>5</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of intoxication problems, such as traffic accidents
and street or pub violence, are attributable to people who drink
moderately most of the time but occasionally drink to excess<sup>.6</sup></p>
<p>Police in New South Wales suggest that 40% of serious assaults
involve alcohol.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>More than one third of persons convicted of homicide were
known to have consumed alcohol. Often the victim will have
consumed alcohol.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Surveys in Perth have found that 25% of patrons leaving
licensed premises attain blood alcohol (BAL) above 0.10 and 10%
above 0.15.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>In NSW, the introduction of random breath testing (RBT)
immediately reduced fatal crashes by 19.5% overall and by 30%
during holiday periods. The 0.05 Blood Alcohol Concentration
(BAC) law, introduced two years before RBT, apparently reduced
fatal crashes by 13% on Saturdays but had no significant effect
on any other days of the week.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Between 10 pm and 4 am, 74% of injured people attending a
major Perth hospital reported having consumed alcohol within the
six-hour period before their injury.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>It was found that 75% of a sample of WA respondents thought it
was 'commonplace for obviously intoxicated people to be served
alcohol on licensed premises'.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>In a 1994 US study of adults at high criminality risk,
criminal behaviour was concluded to be increased mainly by the
use of alcohol and cocaine.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>In a WA (1986) phone-in on domestic violence, 45% of
participants said that their partner had consumed alcohol prior
to the 'most significant' incident.<sup>14</sup></p>
<p>Alcohol plays a part in at least 40% of judicial separations
or divorces and 30% of child abuse cases.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>A Perth study found that 78% of all respondents, from a random
household survey, and 61% of people employed in pubs and clubs
thought the law against serving drunks should be strictly
enforced.<sup>16</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808080">Alcohol-Related Laws </font></h3>
<p>It is illegal in Western Australia to drive with a blood
alcohol level in excess of 0.05% and 0.02% for probationary
drivers.<sup>17</sup></p>
<p>The Liquor Licensing Act 1988 states that: </p>

<h1 align="center"><font color="#808040">Alcohol and the
Workplace</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808040">Key Points: </font></h3>
<p>Alcohol has been estimated to cost Australian industry $4
billion per year. </p>
<p>There is no evidence that problems with alcohol are increasing
in Australia. </p>
<p>Men and women in some industries are more likely to consume
alcohol at hazardous or harmful levels. </p>
<p>Internationally, civil law suits have been brought against
employers for injury caused by employees who have become drunk at
work-sponsored functions.</p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808040">Cost </font></h3>
<p>It has been estimated that alcohol, not including absenteeism,
costs Australian industry about $2 billion per year. The estimate
does not include many hidden costs such as damage to property at
work and reduced work efficiency.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Absenteeism from work caused by drinking, for the 1991/92
financial year, in a business employing 80,000 workers cost $5.5
million, or $68.75 for every employee. Extrapolated to the entire
Australian workforce, this suggests a cost to industry of
approximately $500 million per year.<sup>2</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808040">Case Studies </font></h3>
<p>A study of problem drinking in a Sydney chemical plant showed
that 20% of respondents were currently problem drinkers.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>A study in one mining town in the north-west of Western
Australia indicated that 50% of the men residing in the single
men's quarters consumed more than 28 drinks per week compared to
20% for men in a similar age in Western Australia as a whole.<sup>4</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808040">Law</font> </h3>
<p>The Western Australian Occupational Health, Safety and Welfare
Act (1987) requires employers to take all practicable measures to
ensure employees are not subject to hazards. A hazard is anything
that may result in injury to the person.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In 1990, a Bell Canada employee was convicted for killing two
young women and injuring several while driving home drunk from a
company golf tournament. A civil suit was subsequently brought
against the employee, the golf club and Bell Canada.<sup>6</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#808040">Research</font> </h3>
<p>Studies on pilots have shown impairment on flight-related
tasks for up to 24 hours after the consumption of five or more
standard alcoholic drinks.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Consuming a large number of drinks in a short period of time
will damage the brain. The damage can include short-term memory
loss and a reduced ability to make judgements, engage in abstract
thinking, or learn new information. Some damage is reversible
after several months of abstinence; other types of damage are
irreversible.<sup>5</sup> </p>
<p>A West Australian investigation into fatalities in the mining
industry between 1980 and 1991 found very little evidence of
alcohol and other drugs contributing to fatalities. Unsafe work
practices or inadequate work standards were found to be the
underlying causes.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>A greater proportion of men employed in heavily male-dominated
industries drank at hazardous or harmful risk levels than in
industries with a more balanced, or female-dominated workforce.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>More than 20% of women employed as specialist managers and
sales representatives were found to be drinking at hazardous or
harmful levels. In both of these cases, women exhibited a higher
proportion of risky drinking than men.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>The four highest ranking industries for hazardous or harmful
drinking for men are fishing and hunting; storage; services to
agriculture; and restaurants, hotels and clubs. For women the
industries are air transport; services to transport; wholesale
trade; and paper, paper products, printing and publishing.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>The four industries with the smallest proportion of men
drinking at hazardous or harmful levels are welfare and religious
institutions; education; health and insurance. For women the
industries are transport equipment; textiles and metal
fabrication.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>There is no evidence that problems with alcohol are increasing
in Australia. Per capita consumption has fallen substantially in
recent years.<sup>9</sup> In Western Australia consumption
increased slightly in 1992/1993.<sup>9</sup></p>

<h1 align="center"><font color="#FF8000">Economic Costs of
Alcohol to the Community</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8000">Key Points: </font></h3>
<p>The economic costs of alcohol to the Australian community are
substantial. </p>
<p>Economic costs include tangible costs and intangible costs. </p>
<p>The estimated economic costs to the Australian community are
conservative and likely to be underestimates.</p>
<hr>
<p>A national study aimed at establishing the cost of
drug-related problems estimated that alcohol use cost the
Australian community more than $6 billion a year in 1988. Five
hundred million dollars of this cost was attributed to alcohol
use in Western Australia.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In 1990, alcohol cost the Australian community $6.9 billion.
Productivity losses, road crashes, health care costs, loss of
life and illness combined to make up the total.1 Based on the
population of Western Australia, it can be calculated that West
Australians pay a total public cost of $690 million per year for
excess alcohol consumption.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Alcohol accounts for 42% of the cost of all drug use in
Australia.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Tangible costs of alcohol are estimated as $3 billion a year.
These costs include loss of production (excluding the cost of
absenteeism), health care, accidents, consumption, law
enforcement, education campaigns, research and welfare. Tangible
costs of alcohol use represent 63% of the total cost of all drug
use. These costs are higher than the cost of tobacco (16%) and
illicit drugs (20%).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Intangible costs of alcohol are also estimated to be $3
billion. Intangible costs include mortality, morbidity, pain and
suffering. Intangible costs represent 30% of all drug use costs.
This is less than smoking (66%) but much higher than illicit
drugs (4%).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In Australia, cost to industry for absenteeism from work
because of alcohol use, is estimated to be approximately $500
million per year. This estimate is based on a study conducted by
Telecom to identify the effects of alcohol-related absenteeism
and illness.<sup>3</sup> These figures are likely to be
underestimates. </p>
<p>In 1986, the cost of hospital services for alcohol-related
conditions was $31.7 million in Western Australia.<sup>1</sup> In
1993, alcohol-related bed-day costs added up to $32.1 million in
Western Australia.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>A new analysis of drug-related costs will be available later
in 1995. </p>

<h1 align="center"><font color="#FF8040">Alcohol Consumption
Patterns</font></h1>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8040">Key Points: </font></h3>
<p>The majority (79%) of West Australians over the age of 18
years drink alcohol on a regular basis. </p>
<p>People who drink are more likely to drink at the weekend, with
Saturday being the heaviest day of alcohol consumption. </p>
<p>Different types of drinking behaviour can lead to different
problems, the majority of problems result from intoxication and
regular use of alcohol.</p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8040">Definitions </font></h3>
<p>There are a number of commonly accepted terms used by
researchers to describe alcohol consumption patterns. </p>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Standard drink:</b></font> <br>
        One standard drink contains 10 g of pure alcohol. This is
        equivalent to a 285 mL middy of full strength beer; two
        285 mL middies of light beer; a 100 mL glass of wine; a
        60 mL glass of port or sherry and a 30 mL glass of
        spirits.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Never drink:</b></font> <br>
        No drinks that contained alcohol in the last three
        months.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Occasional drinker:</b></font> <br>
        Any drinks that contained alcohol in the last three
        months.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Low-risk drinker:</b></font> <br>
        Males - up to four standard drinks daily average.<sup>1</sup><br>
        Females - up to two standard drinks daily average.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Hazardous drinker:</b></font> <br>
        Males - four to six standard drinks daily average.<sup>1</sup><br>
        Females - two to four standard drinks daily average.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Harmful drinker:</b></font> <br>
        Males - more than six standard drinks daily average.<sup>1</sup><br>
        Females - more than four standard drinks daily average.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><font color="#FF8040"><b>Binge Drinking:</b></font> <br>
        Describes drinking to intoxication (to get drunk) within
        a short period of time. Two types of time periods are
        usually implied by this term, namely drinking heavily on
        a single drinking occasion or drinking heavily and
        continuously over a number of days or weeks.<sup>1</sup><br>
        <br>
        The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
        suggests that a person is unlikely to develop any
        health-related conditions if drinking at 'low-risk
        levels'. These are: </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>up to four standard drinks for males on any one drinking
        occasion.<sup>1</sup></li>
    <li>up to two standard drinks for females on any one drinking
        occasion.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8040">West Australian Consumption Levels and
Patterns </font></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Eighty per cent of the West Australian population over
        the age of 18 years drink alcohol either regularly or
        occasionally: 64% drink regularly: 76% males, 54% females
        and 15% drink occasionally: 11% males, 19% females.<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Almost 70% of regular drinkers between the ages of 18 -
        44 years drink on three days or less in the week, with
        almost 50% of all alcohol consumed being on the day of
        heaviest consumption.<sup>2</sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Saturday, Friday and Sunday, in that order, are the days
        of heaviest consumption<sup>.2</sup><br>
    </li>
    <li>On the heaviest day of drinking (Saturday) 67% of 18 -
        44-year-olds (69% males, 64% females) are drinking at
        hazardous or harmful levels.2 <br>
    </li>
    <li>On the heaviest day of drinking (Saturday), 18 -
        44-year-old males are drinking an average of nine
        standard drinks and 18 - 44-year-old females are drinking
        an average of five standard drinks.<sup>2</sup><br>
    </li>
    <li>Population surveys of alcohol consumption account for
        only 60% of alcohol sold. This is because of a number of
        biases, such as under-reporting and under-sampling of
        heavy and problem drinkers.<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8040"><b>Problems Relating to Alcohol</b> </font></h3>
<p>Thorley describes the interaction between three categories of
drinking behaviour which may generate alcohol problems (problems
related to intoxication, problems related to regular excessive
consumption; and problems related to dependence).<sup>4</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8040">Source: Thorley A. Medical Responses to
Problem Drinking.<sup>5</sup></font></h3>
<p>An individual who drinks may experience problems in any one or
combination of these areas.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Problems related to intoxication are more likely to result
from the acute effects of alcohol. They are the most visual and
disturbing effects of alcohol use. These problems are often
social in nature. For example, embarrassment from being drunk,
violent and aggressive behaviour, drink driving, family violence,
physical and psychological injuries.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Regular, excessive use may affect an individual's health and
cause long-term physical damage to organs such as liver, brain
and cardiovascular system. In addition, financial difficulties
may arise as regular, excessive alcohol use requires monetary
expenditure.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Problems of dependence may occur as an individual begins to
devote more time to alcohol use at the cost of other activities.
Dependence can be found on a continuum from minor to severe; it
can be expressed as the degree of difficulty the individual has
in refraining from use.<sup>4</sup></p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#FF8040">Summary </font></h3>
<p>Young people typically experience problems with intoxication.
In contrast adults may experience problems with regular use of
alcohol. Few people experience problems with dependence in
comparison to the problems resulting from intoxication and
regular use of alcohol. Thorley's model highlights the level of
problems caused by intoxication and regular use of alcohol. Less
harm is caused by problems of dependence. </p>

<p>The DrinkSafe Campaign is a long-term State Government
initiative that has been running since 1988. The DrinkSafe
Campaign aims to reduce alcohol-related illness, injury and death
in Western Australia. The campaign targets drinkers aged 18 - 44
years with a moderation message for alcohol use. </p>
<p>The campaign has developed through a number of phases, with
specific aims and objectives. Each phase of the campaign is
directed by pre-campaign research that takes into account local,
state and national research findings. </p>
<p>The following is a summary of the eight DrinkSafe Campaign
phases that have taken place from 1988 to 1995. The Respect
Yourself Campaign has been implemented in three stages. </p>

The Respect Yourself component of the DrinkSafe Campaign was
introduced in October 1990 targeting young drinkers aged 18 - 24
years of age. This campaign highlighted the health and social
consequences of drinking to intoxication. It aimed to increase
young people's awareness of the short-term negative consequences
of binge-drinking. </p>
<p><font color="#008080"><b>Stage 2</b> </font><br>
The second stage of the Respect Yourself Campaign ran from
February to May 1994 and promoted negative attitudes towards
excessive alcohol consumption over short periods of time
(binge-drinking) among the target group, 18 - 24-year-old
drinkers. </p>
<p><font color="#008080"><b>Stage 3</b> </font><br>
The third stage commenced in April 1995 and further promoted
negative attitudes towards excessive alcohol consumption over

be a responsible host. </p>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#008080">Campaign Strategies </font></h3>
<p>Both the DrinkSafe and the Respect Yourself campaigns use a
range of strategies to promote the message to their target group
including: </p>
<ul>
    <li>mass media (television, radio and billboard
        advertisements) to promote the specifically designed
        messages to the DrinkSafe and Respect Yourself target
        groups. </li>
    <li>promotion of the DrinkSafe and Respect Yourself message
        in sponsoring sport and music events. </li>
    <li>messages from Regional Health Education Officers in
        regional community activities.</li>
    <li>promotional items such as keyrings, T-shirts, sunglasses,
        stickers and caps produced and distributed at a community
        level. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><font color="#008080">Evaluation </font></h3>
<p>Each phase of the DrinkSafe Campaign has been evaluated and
key results include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>increased awareness of the recommended low-risk daily
        limits </li>
    <li>very high levels of awareness and approval for the
        campaigns </li>
    <li>correct identification of general and specific campaign
        messages </li>
    <li>increased awareness of illnesses caused by regular,
        excessive alcohol consumption </li>
    <li>increased awareness of the short-term negative health and
        social consequences of binge drinking </li>
    <li>a belief among a significant proportion of the target
        group that the campaign messages were personally relevant </li>
    <li>increased awareness of the methods for reducing
        consumption </li>
    <li>some significant shifts in attitudes towards intoxication </li>
    <li>a significant proportion of drinkers reporting that the
        campaigns were an important factor in their decision to
        reduce consumption. </li>

<h3><font color="#FF0080">Key Points: </font></h3>
<p>Based on current levels of knowledge, it is advisable for
women to minimise alcohol consumption during pregnancy. </p>
<p>There is inconclusive evidence that low-risk levels (one to
two standard drinks per day) of alcohol consumption during
pregnancy harms the fetus. </p>
<p>Heavy drinking in pregnancy has the potential to cause harm to
the fetus, increasing the risk of Fetal Alcohol Effects or Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome.</p>
<hr>
<p>It has been known for centuries that alcohol has the potential
to cause damage to the fetus during pregnancy.<sup>1,2,3</sup></p>
<p>Alcohol is recognised as a teratogenic substance that is
capable of producing birth defects in the developing embryo or
fetus.<sup>4,5,6</sup></p>
<p>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is classified as an
alcohol-related birth defect and is now recognised as the leading
cause of mental retardation in developed countries.<sup>7,8,1</sup></p>
<p>It was not until the 1970s that the scientific community
recognised FAS. Findings from Jones and Smith described the
constellation of finds associated with alcohol consumption and
exposure to the fetus.<sup>4,4a</sup></p>
<p>The main features of FAS are now agreed to be: </p>
<ul>
    <li>pre and post-natal growth retardation </li>
    <li>adverse effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS):
        intellectual impairment, developmental delay and
        behavioural problems</li>
    <li>characteristic facial features: flattened midface, a
        small jaw and a thin upper lip.<sup>4,9,7,10</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a wide range of effects and features that fall short
of FAS. Rosett, et al. recommended the use of the phase Fetal
Alcohol Effects (FAE).(10) FAE implies that the infant or child
has some features of FAS but does not meet the minimal criteria
for FAS.<sup>2,11</sup></p>
<p>The estimated prevalence of FAS in developed countries,
including Australia, ranges from 0.3 per thousand to 2 per
thousand live births. This wide variation is dependent on
definition, sampling and whether general or target populations
are measured.<sup>7,12</sup></p>
<p>The estimated prevalence of FAE is more difficult to determine
as universal diagnostic criteria have not been established.
American research indicates a higher prevalence of FAS ranging
from 3.1 per thousand live births to 6 per thousand live births.<sup>1</sup>
This variation highlights the interaction of other lifestyle
factors such as smoking and other drug use, nutritional status,
ante-natal care, other environmental and social factors acting as
confounders.<sup>13</sup></p>
<p>Australian research in this area is limited. Statistics on the
incidence of FAS are not readily available in Western Australia
or nationwide.<sup>14-16</sup></p>
<p>Unpublished studies from Australian obstetric hospitals
confirm a one to two per thousand incidence and establish the
presence of FAS and FAE.1.<sup>17-19</sup></p>
<p>The Western Australian Birth Defects Registry's annual report
indicates a birth prevalence of FAS of 0.078 per thousand births
in Western Australia. Low prevalence may be the result of
under-diagnosis, under-notification, or both.<sup>20</sup></p>
<p>Australian research indicates low prevalence of hazardous and
harmful alcohol intake in women during pregnancy.<sup>32-33</sup></p>
<p>There is limited evidence that alcohol use during pregnancy
causes spontaneous abortion.<sup>16,24,31</sup></p>
<p>Many working in the health field claim that FAS and FAE are
under-reported and under-diagnosed meaning the prevalence rates
are underestimated.<sup>9,14,20,21</sup></p>
<p>Alcohol use in pregnancy raises serious debate in the health
and research fields, FAS and FAE are regarded as preventable
birth-related defects, therefore an important public health
issue.<sup>1,7,15,21-23</sup></p>
<p>Women who drink heavily during pregnancy may be at risk of
producing babies with FAS.<sup>8,23,24</sup></p>
<p>The definition of what constitutes heavy drinking during
pregnancy is not clear in the literature. There is some agreement
that it refers to five or more drinks on one occasion.<sup>16,25,26</sup></p>
<p>Light drinking refers to no more than one to two standard
drinks per day, between four and six days a week and includes two
alcohol-free days. These amounts appear to be the same as the
National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) low-risk
levels for alcohol consumption for women.<sup>16,24-26</sup> </p>
<p>Light drinking by pregnant women has not been proven to harm
the fetus.<sup>15,16,25,26</sup></p>
<p>Researchers are unable to agree on a low-risk level of alcohol
consumption during pregnancy. There is an urgent need for further
research in this area that takes into account alcohol consumption
levels and patterns of use.<sup>5,16,24,26</sup></p>
<p>Research states that it is possible that some alcohol-related
birth defects may be male-mediated, since in most cases fathers
of FAS children are also heavy drinkers.<sup>24,30</sup></p>
<p>In the United States and United Kingdom, it is recommended
that abstinence from alcohol prior to and during pregnancy will
prevent FAE or FAS. These recommendations are based on the belief
that there is no way to determine what level of alcohol exposure
poses the risk of damage to the fetus.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p>In Australia the NHMRC recommends that with the current level
of knowledge, women who are pregnant are best advised to abstain
from alcohol.<sup>28,29</sup> Lipson considers that in the light
of the uncertainty over low-risk levels of consumption of alcohol
during pregnancy, these recommendations are in need of review.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>The conservative abstinence message for alcohol during
pregnancy remains controversial.<sup>1,15,16,24,26</sup></p>
<p>Further research is needed to support the claims of the
abstinence model. This research needs to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>identify the relationship between dose, time and duration
        of exposure of alcohol on the fetus during pregnancy;<sup>15,16,24-26</sup></li>
    <li>address the confounding factors in research such as the
        interaction of other lifestyle factors; smoking and other
        drug use, nutritional status, ante-natal care, and other
        environmental and social factors;<sup>16,24,26</sup> and</li>
    <li>identify universal research methodologies for consumption
        of alcohol during pregnancy, so valid and reliable
        comparisons can be made in all future research in this
        area.<sup>16,26</sup></li>
</ul>

<h1>Alcohol Use Among Aboriginal People</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Key Points: </h3>
<p>Alcohol drinking rates among Aboriginal people are lower than
among non-Aboriginal people. This is particularly the case with
females. </p>
<p>Figures show that 48% of Aboriginal females and 29% of
Aboriginal males do not drink or have become ex-drinkers.(2) </p>
<p>Some aboriginal people who drink, do so in public. This leads
to a greater awareness of their drinking behaviour by
non-Aboriginal people.(1)(3) </p>
<p>One out of six Aboriginal drinkers in their 40s generally give
up alcohol.(4) </p>
<p>Most Aboriginal women's groups, and two thirds of the
Aboriginal groups in Western Australia, state that alcohol does
cause problems in their community.(5)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Prevalence of Drinking Among Aboriginal People </h3>
<p>The highest group of drinkers are younger Aboriginal males
aged 15 - 29 years.(6) </p>
<p>Figures show 22% of Aboriginal males who consume alcohol do so
at levels far in excess of the levels recommended by the National
Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).(5)(7) </p>
<p>Most Aboriginal people agree that the health and lives of
their families and communities are being damaged and often
dominated by alcohol.(2) </p>
<p>Alcohol creates major problems and cost for the law
enforcement and justice systems, as well as for the community as
a whole.(3) </p>
<hr>
<h3>Harm Caused by Drinking Among Aboriginal People </h3>
<p>Research analysing the cause of Aboriginal deaths provides
evidence that alcohol plays a major role in the high mortality
rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.(8)(1) </p>
<p>Assaults were the most common type of alcohol-related injury
among male and female Aboriginal people in the Kimberley.(4) </p>
<p>Higher proportions of alcohol-caused deaths occurred at young
ages among Aboriginal people than among non-Aboriginal people in
Western Australia.(5) </p>
<p>Among Aboriginal people, 61% of male deaths and 70% of female
deaths caused by alcohol use occur before the age of 55 years.
This contrasts with 35% males and 23% females for non-Aboriginal
people before that age.(1) </p>
<p>Among Aboriginal males, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, road
injuries, and alcohol dependence syndrome are the three most
frequent specific causes of death from alcohol use.(1) </p>
<p>Between 1983 - 1989, alcoholic liver cirrhosis was the most
frequent cause of alcohol-related deaths of Aboriginal females.
Assault was the second, followed by road injuries.(1) </p>
<p>Aboriginal deaths from alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver
have been falling by an average of 7% per year. On a comparative
basis, the peak death rate for cirrhosis of the liver among
Aboriginal women occurs 30 years earlier than among
non-Aboriginal women.(9) </p>
<p>From 1989 - 1991, alcohol dependence syndrome, which had not
been one of the three leading causes in the earlier periods,
became the most frequent cause of alcohol-related deaths among
Aboriginal females.(1) </p>
<p>Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking claimed 469 Aboriginal
deaths between 1983 - 1991; an average of 52 lives each year, or
one Aboriginal person each week.(1) </p>
<hr>
<h3>Hospitalisation Attributed to Alcohol </h3>
<p>Assault is the most frequent cause of alcohol-related
hospitalisation for Aboriginal females, with the admission rate
increasing slightly over the years.(9) </p>
<p>From 1983 - 1991 in Western Australia there were 10,478
Aboriginal hospital admissions; 8,054 of them resulting from
alcohol.(2) </p>
<p>Seventy percent of health problems in Aboriginal communities
are related to alcohol compared with other drugs (30%) and
housing (18%). </p>
<p>Death rates and hospitalisation rates from alcohol-related
causes were higher for Aboriginal people than for non-aboriginal
people in virtually all age groups.(1) </p>

<h1>Alcohol Interaction with Other Drugs</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Key Points: </h3>
<p>Alcohol is a potent Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant. </p>
<p>The effects of alcohol may be potentiated or enhanced if used
with other CNS depressant drugs. </p>
<p>Sedative depressant drugs such as barbiturates and
benzodiazepines should not be used in combination with alcohol.</p>
<hr>
<p>Alcohol (ethyl alcohol) is one of the most widely used drugs.
It is a potent Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant. A CNS
depressant drug works by slowing down the brain and nervous
system.(1-3) </p>
<p>The CNS depressant group of drugs is capable of inducing
varying degrees of behavioural depression as a result of relative
depression of the CNS.(3) </p>
<p><i>Interactions</i> may be either: </p>
<ul>
    <li>an alteration in the absorption, distribution or
        disposition of one drug by another; or</li>
    <li>interactions between agonists and antagonists at the drug
        recepters.(4)(5) </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Alcohol and Other Depressant Drugs </h3>
<p>The effects of alcohol may be potentiated or enhanced if used
with other CNS depressant drugs, resulting in more sedation,
greater impairment of driving, or greater impairment of other
types of performance than might be expected.(3-6) </p>
<p>Alcohol when taken in combination with other CNS depressants
can lead to the depression of respiratory or cardiac functions.
This can result in unconsciousness and even death.(3)(4) </p>
<p>When alcohol and barbituates are taken together, they will
seriously exaggerate the CNS depression effect resulting in the
impairment of alertness, concentration, coordination and driving
ability of the person.(3)(4) </p>
<p>The CNS depressant effects of benzodiazepines (minor
tranquillisers) are enhanced by alcohol, resulting in a decrease
of a person's alertness, co-ordination and motor
skills.(3)(4)(11) </p>
<p>Alcohol when used with cannabis will also decrease a person's
alertness, motor and intellectual skills.(3)(6) </p>
<p>Alcohol when taken with morphine, heroin, pethidine and
methadone enhances the CNS depressant effects of these
drugs.(4)(7) </p>
<p>Little is known about the interaction of alcohol and volatile
substances, however an additive effect is probable.(9) </p>
<p>The interaction of alcohol and antihistamines appears to
impair psycho-motor performance.(4) </p>
<hr>
<h4>Alcohol and Stimulant Drugs </h4>
<p>Stimulant drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine act as
non-specific antagonists and may arouse the person
temporarily.(3) </p>
<hr>
<h3>Alcohol and Hallucinogen Drugs </h3>
<p>Alcohol used with hallucinogens may result in a depressive
potentiation effect.(10) </p>
<hr>
<h3>Alcohol and other Medicinal Drugs </h3>
<p>The majority of antibiotics do not react with alcohol. A
limited number of antibiotics, for example metronidazole and
tinidazole do react with alcohol. They may cause headache, nausea
and flushing.(4)(6) </p>
<p>Alcohol significantly enhances and prolongs aspirin-induced
bleeding time.(11) </p>

<h1 align="center"><em>ALCOHOL</em> <br>
<em>Separating the facts from the myths</em> </h1>
<hr>
<h3><em>'Alcohol isn't really a drug.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
Alcohol is one of the most commonly used drugs in Australia.
There are many different customs and attitudes associated with
drinking alcohol. A drug can be defined as any substance which
alters normal brain function &#150; so alcohol is definitely a
drug. Alcohol-related problems are one of the four major public
health problems in Australia, along with coronary heart disease,
injury and cancer.</p>
<h3><em>'People can think more clearly after drinking alcohol.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
Being a depressant, alcohol actually slows the central nervous
system. So thinking becomes less clear. Being more talkative and
feeling more confident is likely to be the result of the
drinker's inhibitions being depressed along with other bodily
responses and functions.</p>
<h3><em>'Alcohol affects all people in the same way and to the
same extent.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
Alcohol affects all people differently. This is due to the
interaction of factors associated with the drug itself (amount,
strength, how quickly consumed), the person (health, personality,
mood, body size, sex, and age), and the environment (being alone,
with friends or family) where the alcohol is consumed.</p>
<h3><em>'A male and female who are the same height and weight
will be affected by alcohol in the same way.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
Women experience higher blood alcohol levels after drinking the
same amount as men, even if they have the same body weight.
Females tend to have more fatty tissue and less water in their
bodies than males, which causes alcohol to be absorbed
differently.</p>
<h3><em>'Drinking coffee, vomiting or taking a cold shower will
sober up someone who has consumed too much alcohol.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
The only thing that will sober a person up is time. About 90% of
alcohol is broken down and eliminated through the liver. It takes
an average healthy adult about one hour to eliminate one standard
drink of alcohol. So drinking coffee, vomiting, exercising or
taking a cold shower may make you feel better, but will not sober
you up any quicker.</p>
<h3><em>'A middy (285 mL) of full-strength beer (4&#150;6%
alcohol/volume) will contain the same amount of alcohol as a
middy (285 mL) of white wine.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
A middy of full-strength beer contains the same amount of alcohol
as a glass (100 mL) of white wine. Both of these drinks are said
to be standard, and contain approximately 10 grams of alcohol.</p>
<h3><em>'Alcohol will help you be more sociable.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
Alcohol does not make people more sociable. As a depressant,
alcohol slows down the central nervous system and may therefore
lead to people feeling less inhibited. However alcohol actually
impairs reflexes and judgements, which may affect the
decision-making process.<sup>1</sup> People are more likely to
become abusive, violent and irrational after drinking alcohol.</p>
<h3><em>'It is safe to drink alcohol with prescription drugs.'</em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font><br>
It is dangerous to combine alcohol with other drugs. The effect
of some drugs such as antibiotics will be neutralised, while
other drug and alcohol combinations may cause drowsiness and
reduce the ability to do simple tasks, and in some cases
unconsciousness.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<h3><em>'A person under the age of 18 years can legally purchase
alcohol.' </em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is&#133;</font> <br>
It is illegal for children under the age of 18 to consume,
possess, buy, obtain or attempt to obtain liquor in a public
place or licensed premises. It is also an offence for adults to
sell or supply alcohol to children under the age of 18 in
licensed premises. </p>
<h3><em>'People with alcohol problems are derelicts.' </em></h3>
<p><font size="4">The fact is...</font> <br>
Most people with alcohol-related problems are part of mainstream
society. They live with their families, have friends and hold a
steady job. This often means that the problems are hidden and
difficult to deal with. </p>

<hr>
<p>Laws about alcohol are made mainly by State Governments. These
laws regulate who can sell and buy alcohol, and where it can be
bought and consumed.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ALCOHOL-RELATED_LAWS">ALCOHOL-RELATED LAWS</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Liquor Licensing Act 1988</strong> outlines the
Western Australian laws about alcohol. <br>
<strong>Drinking on licensed premises</strong> (for example pubs,
clubs etc.): </p>
<ul>
    <li>It is illegal for a person under the age of 18 years to
        consume alcohol on licensed premises. </li>
    <li>It is also illegal to sell or supply alcohol to people
        under 18 years of age on licensed premises. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The right to complain: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>People living or working near licensed premises can
        complain about disorderly conduct from patrons and noise
        coming from the premises. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Refusal to serve: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is an offence for employers or employees of licensed
        premises to sell or supply liquor to a drunken person. </li>
    <li>Admittance to licensed premises may be refused for
        reasons such as drunkenness, disorderly behaviour and
        unacceptable dress. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drinking on unlicensed premises: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is illegal for any person to consume alcohol on
        unlicensed premises without the consent of the owner or
        the person or authority having control of those premises. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drinking in public places: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is an offence in Western Australia for anybody to
        drink in a public place, such as the street, park, beach
        etc. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drinking alcohol and driving: </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is an offence in Western Australia to drive with a <strong>Blood
        Alcohol Concentration (BAC)</strong> of 0.05% and over.
        'P' plate drivers are not legally able to drive with a
        BAC of 0.02% and over. In practice it is safest not to
        drink at all if planning to drive. The chance of causing
        a motor vehicle accident with a BAC of 0.05% is twice the
        chance of causing an accident with a BAC of 0.02%. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RANDOM_BREATH_TESTING">RANDOM BREATH TESTING (RBT)</a></h3>
<p>This was first introduced in Victoria, in 1976. By 1988 it was
operating in all States and Territories. RBT allows the police to
stop a person's vehicle at any time and ask the driver to take a
breathalyser test. The driver must agree to do so or else they
commit an offence. This test will help to determine a person's <strong>BAC</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>BAC</strong> is a measure of the amount of alcohol in
a person's blood. In general, the more alcohol a person drinks
the higher their BAC, but it does depend on a number of factors: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of drinks </li>
    <li>Time taken to consume drinks </li>
    <li>Type of drinks consumed </li>
    <li>Whether or not there is substantial food in the stomach </li>
    <li>Size, build and sex of the drinker </li>
    <li>Use of other drugs. </li>
</ul>
<p>The two most important factors are the number of drinks and
the time taken to consume them. </p>
<p>Breaking this law carries heavy penalties &#150;
disqualification from driving for a set period and fines, or even
imprisonment for repeated offences. Anyone under the influence of
alcohol who injures or kills another person while driving a motor
vehicle can go to prison. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="PENALTIES">PENALTIES</a> FOR DRIVING WITH A BLOOD
ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION</h3>
<p>PROBATIONARY DRIVERS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HELD A LICENCE
FOR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS: </p>
<ul>
    <li>BAC GREATER THAN 0.02%<br>
        <strong>Penalty:</strong> Automatic cancellation of
        licence for three months, following which the offender
        must reapply for their licence, and $100 &#150; $500
        fine. </li>
</ul>
<p>DRIVERS WHO HAVE HELD A LICENCE FOR GREATER THAN TWELVE
MONTHS: </p>
<ul>
    <li>BAC GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.05% (but less than 0.08%)<br>
        <strong>Penalty:</strong> $100.00 fine and three demerit
        points. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>BAC GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.08% (but less than 0.15%) <br>
        <strong>First Offence:</strong> $300 &#150; $800 fine, or
        a community service order and loss of driver's licence
        for three months or longer. <br>
        <strong>Second Offence:</strong> $600 &#150; $1200 fine,
        or a community service order and loss of driver's licence
        for six months or longer. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>BAC GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.15% OR REFUSING AN ALCOHOL
        AND/OR DRUG TEST <br>
        <strong>First Offence:</strong> $500 &#150; $1200 fine,
        or a community service order and loss of driver's licence
        for six months or longer. <br>
        <strong>Second Offence:</strong> $1000 &#150; $1800 fine
        or six months imprisonment, or a community service order
        and loss of licence for two years or longer. <br>
        <strong>Third and other Offences:</strong> $1200 &#150;
        $2500 fine or eighteen months imprisonment and loss of
        licence for life. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="CRIME_AND_ALCOHOL">CRIME AND ALCOHOL</a></h3>
<p>There appears to be a strong relationship between alcohol use
and crime. For example, more than 70% of people in Australia who
have committed a violent crime had been drinking beforehand.
Alcohol is a factor in 60% of homicides and in nearly half of
these, the victim had been drinking with their assailant. In
about a third of cases, the victim starts the fight that leads to
their death. The victim and attacker are frequently friends and
these crimes are often not premeditated. Despite popular belief,
alcohol is more likely than other drugs to be a factor in violent
crimes. </p>
<p>For the 1991/2 financial year there were 8642 reported cases
of crimes of violence in Western Australia. Most of these were
for common assault (53.7%) or assault with bodily harm (20.4%)
The most common locations for these offences were private
dwellings (32.8%) or on some thoroughfare (19.7%). The degree of
alcohol involvement in each case is not known; however a strong
link was shown between the number of night-time (10 pm to 6 am)
assaults and the amount of alcohol people drank. The majority of
violent crimes which occur in the home, such as domestic violence
and sexual assaults, remain unreported. </p>
<p>Boredom, crowding, discomfort, noise and alcohol consumption
are responsible for violence in and around pubs. The victim is
usually alone or in a small group and is often more intoxicated
than the attacker. </p>

<h1 align="center"><em>HISTORY OF ALCOHOL</em></h1>
<hr>
<p>The word alcohol comes from the Arabic 'al Kuhul', but no one
knows when it was first used or by whom. Alcohol is believed to
be the oldest and probably the most widely used drug in the
world. </p>
<p>Used as far back as 7000 BC, alcohol has long been associated
with many customs and rituals. Historic sketches suggest that
Neolithic people knew how to make alcoholic drinks through the
fermentation of cereals. In ancient Persia, the King and his
advisers would discuss important issues when drunk, and later
review the decisions when sober. If during both conferences the
same decisions were made, the King would act on these decisions.
Alcohol has been used as a social beverage, tranquilliser,
sedative, stimulant and as an intoxicant. There are also cases of
animals experiencing alcohol intoxication. The East African
elephants would seek and eat fermenting mangoes and become drunk
and boisterous. </p>
<p>Alcohol has played a significant role in religious ceremonies.
The New Testament records Christ as referring to wine as his
blood, and wine is consumed in many Christian communities as a
symbolic representation of the blood of Christ. Alcohol use
varies widely between cultures. For example, the Islamic faith
forbids the use of alcohol, and the majority of Muslims tend to
abide by that prohibition. In other societies heavy drinking has
been built into religious ceremonies. The Aztecs used to get
drunk at all major religious ceremonies so as not to offend their
gods. </p>
<p>In ancient Greece there was a god of wine &#150; Bacchus. It
was said that through the use of wine, he was able to free the
soul of all impediments of the flesh. However, the Greeks used
wine in moderation. Plato took a strong line on drinking &#150;
advocating that no one under the age of 30 should be able to
drink wine, and those over 30 should only drink it to relieve the
infirmities of the flesh. </p>
<p>The Romans were more accustomed to drinking vast amounts of
wine. Often at all-night banquets, people would try and outdrink
each other. By the first century AD, the emperor Domitian was so
alarmed about widespread drunkenness he ordered that half the
vineyards in Rome be destroyed, and prohibited the planting of
any more without his permission. </p>
<p>Wine and beer have long histories. In medieval times, those
who could afford it drank alcohol in the form of wine or ale
throughout the day. People's diets were generally monotonous and
daily existence for most was characterised by hard labour and
physical discomfort. Alcohol was used to relieve the drudgery.
The manufacture of high alcohol spirits, such as gin and whisky
followed the discovery of distillation about 1000 years ago.
Alchemists were most impressed by these amazing new drugs, and
they were credited with remarkable properties. They were thought
to be an antidote to senility! </p>
<p>In the 18th century, British soldiers brought cheap gin back
to London from Holland. This was known as the 'gin epidemic'. At
this time the Industrial Revolution had begun in Britain.
Conditions were harsh and gin was often given as wages to
employees. Gin houses were everywhere, and it was advertised that
drinkers could drink for a penny and get dead drunk for two
pence. In gin houses the floor was covered with straw so those
who were intoxicated could rest comfortably when in a state of
drunkenness. </p>
<p>In 1736, the situation was so bad Parliament introduced the
Gin Act, imposing severe restrictions on the sale of spirits.
This Act resulted in a series of riots and civil disturbances,
and was repealed in 1743. </p>
<hr>
<h3>PROHIBITION</h3>
<p>The 19th century witnessed a tendency towards moderation. In
the US in 1873, a movement called the Women's Christian
Temperance Movement occupied the main saloons in town, where the
members knelt in prayer and asked the saloon owners to close
their establishments. They believed alcohol was sinful. Women all
over the country joined the movement and within a few months
thousands of saloons had closed, at least temporarily. The
Temperance movement lobbied aggressively for alcohol to be banned
and in 1920 they won. As a result prohibition began, meaning
alcohol was completely illegal for 13 years. </p>
<p>Prohibition was difficult to enforce. People produced their
own alcohol and illegal saloons sprang up overnight. A black
market in bootlegging was created and run by gangsters such as Al
Capone. In 1933 the Act enforcing prohibition was repealed
because it did not work.</p>
<hr>
<h3>HISTORY OF ALCOHOL IN AUSTRALIA</h3>
<p>Alcohol has played a significant part in Australia's history
since the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, when Captain Arthur
Phillip and his officers raised the British flag at Sydney Cove
and drank to the King's health. Rum was used as an important
commodity for bartering between early non-convict settlers. </p>
<p>It has been reported that the first European settlers in
Australia drank more alcohol per head of population than any
other community in the history of mankind. No doubt the
conditions were extremely punishing, and alcohol was used as a
way to escape from the dreadful realities of colonial life. In
Perth in 1836 there was a licensed house for every 75 people and
labourers were supplied with nearly 12 gallons (54.5 litres) of
spirits per annum. </p>
<p>Alcohol consumption has become so widespread that it is the
most commonly used and socially acceptable drug in Australia. </p>

<h3>WHY SET STANDARDS ?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Standards have been set so that people know which levels
        of consumption will cause the least harm to their health. </li>
    <li>Keeping track of and cutting down on the amount of
        alcohol consumed can reduce negative consequences such as
        hangovers, unsafe sex practices, vomiting, violence and
        abusive behaviour. </li>
    <li>People can monitor more effectively how much they are
        drinking. </li>
    <li>Health authorities provide a guide to low-risk drinking
        levels for healthy adults over the age of 18 to help
        reduce harm associated with alcohol use in the community.
        Some people such as pregnant women, people on some
        medication and people who are alcohol-dependent should
        not drink any alcohol. </li>
</ul>
<div align="center"><center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="2" width="60%">
    <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="center">These low-risk drinking levels are as
        follows: </p>
        <p align="center"><strong>For WOMEN:<br>
        </strong>no more than 2 STANDARD drinks per day </p>
        <p align="center"><strong>For MEN:<br>
        </strong>no more than 4 STANDARD drinks per day </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center></div>
<p>These levels are a daily guide. Drinks can not be `saved' and
consumed on one day only. It is important to note that these
low-risk levels of drinking refer to health risks and not to the
risk associated with drinking and driving. </p>
<p>Since December 1995 STANDARD DRINK LABELLING has been included
on all alcoholic beverage containers sold to the general public.
Alcoholic drink containers must show the number of standard
drinks per container. This labelling will assist consumers in
calculating their drinks according to a standard system. </p>

<h3><a name="TheNewborn">The Newborn</a></h3>
<p>All normal newborns are intelligent and able to learn from
birth. They can hear, feel, see, taste and smell, and by using
their senses will begin to learn about their world and the people
in it who are, in the beginning, their whole world.</p>
<p>A baby has both emotional and physical needs from birth.</p>
<p>Frequent close physical contact is essential, particularly in
the early weeks. Warm physical closeness promotes a feeling of
comfort and well-being, of being loved and secure. By placing the
baby on the mother or father&#146;s chest, the baby will also be
able to hear the heart beat, which has been a familiar sound for
the past few months.</p>
<h3><a name="Crying">Crying</a></h3>
<p>Parents often don&#146;t realise how much a new baby cries,
and they find it very distressing. Crying is the new baby&#146;s
only effective way of communicating. The baby has a different cry
for different needs. Gradually you will learn to recognise each
one of them. Crying can be due to hunger or discomfort. Often
&#145;wind&#146; is blamed, but more often the baby&#146;s need
is for physical closeness, to be cuddled and comforted. Cuddling
is reassuring. Providing love and comfort is not spoiling the
baby.</p>
<p>Some babies &#145;fuss&#146; before settling to sleep. After a
while you will recognise your baby&#146;s individual pattern of
settling.</p>
<h3><a name="Feeding">Feeding</a></h3>
<p>New babies can be sleepy. Some of them take a while to learn
to suck vigorously. Feed times can be long, and you may need
practice at keeping your baby awake in the first few weeks.</p>
<p>Some dribbling or regurgitating during or after feeds is to be
expected. If you think there is too much, mention it to the
doctor or nurse.</p>
<h3><a name="Breastfeeding">Breastfeeding</a></h3>
<p>Breast milk is the best food and gives a baby all the
nutrients needed for good health. Breast milk is always
available, is easy to digest and means less chance of infection.
Warmth and close skin contact during breastfeeding also gives
your baby and you pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>This close physical relationship allows mother and baby to get
to know one another quickly. Physical closeness with the father
is of equal importance to the child&#146;s learning and to their
relationship.</p>
<p>If the choice is made not to breastfeed, the baby&#146;s
emotional needs can be fulfilled at feed time in exactly the same
way. In this situation, fathers too can share in feeding the
baby.</p>
<h3><a name="SuckingTime">Sucking Time</a></h3>
<p>The need to suck will vary considerably among babies. Some
will need to suck more frequently than others and for varying
lengths of time. New parents may be confused if the baby&#146;s
need to suck is misunderstood: &#145;If sucking means hunger,
have I got enough milk?&#146; If your baby receives no fluids
other than breast milk, appears alert and has at least six to
eight wet nappies in each 24-hour period, it is an indication
your supply is sufficient.</p>
<h3><a name="Colostrum">Colostrum</a></h3>
<p>There may be only a small quantity of colostrum, the very
first milk, but it is high in protein and calories. Colostrum has
excellent anti-infective properties. These are also present to a
lesser extent in breast milk. However, breast milk will not
protect a baby against all illnesses &#150; whooping cough for
example. It is wise to keep your baby away from people with
infections such as colds and flu, and to have your baby immunised
at the recommended ages.</p>
<p>When the milk changes during the first week it may look blue
and watery, but its food value is still excellent.</p>
<p>The time it takes to establish breastfeeding is variable. It
may even take six to eight weeks, but baby will get all that is
needed if feeding times are flexible.</p>
<p>Waking at night for a feed (or two) is usual. This helps baby
to grow rapidly and establishes breastfeeding more quickly. It is
the baby&#146;s sucking that stimulates the production of milk;
so the more sucking, the more milk there will be.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile learning how to express your own milk while
you are in hospital. This can be a way of giving yourself comfort
if your breasts are too full, or of collecting milk if for any
reason your baby cannot go to the breast.</p>
<p>Careful personal cleanliness is important for a nursing
mother, and breast pads need to be changed frequently. Avoid
using plastic-backed pads. They tend to keep the skin soggy and
encourage nipple soreness. Ask for the &#145;Let&#146;s look at
... Breastfeeding&#146; pamphlet.</p>
<h3><a name="BottleFeeding">Bottle Feeding</a></h3>
<p>Commercial infant formula is recommended for bottle-fed babies
and is more suitable than cow&#146;s or goat&#146;s milk or
soy-based drinks. Babies should drink formula (and other milks)
for the first 12 months of life before changing to cow&#146;s
milk.</p>
<p>The formula powder and boiled water must be measured carefully
when making up baby&#146;s bottle. Your child health nurse will
be happy to discuss this with you.</p>
<p>Bottle-fed babies should always be held and cuddled at feeding
time as they need the same loving and fondling as breastfed
babies.</p>
<h3><a name="BoiledWater">Boiled Water</a></h3>
<p>A baby may get thirsty between meals, like anyone else,
particularly in hot weather. Use a teaspoon or a bottle to offer
a drink of boiled water (unsweetened) if baby is awake and
unsettled. A baby may want a taste only or may drink 30 to 60 mL.
Breastfed babies may prefer an extra feed. Let the baby decide.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="NewLook">New Look</a></h3>
<p>Newborn babies do not always look their best in the first
weeks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Head shape:</strong></em> The baby&#146;s head may
have an odd shape from having to adjust to the birth canal. It
will soon improve.</p>
<p><em><strong>Skin:</strong></em> Skin can be wrinkled and red,
scaly or peeling. Many babies show signs of jaundice (yellowing)
around the third day. This fades and is usually gone completely
by the eighth day. Small white &#145;milk spots&#146; or milia
are common on a baby&#146;s face or chin. They will disappear.
Pinkish, so-called &#145;pressure&#146; marks, often on upper
eyelids, nape of neck or forehead, fade gradually. This may take
some time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Feet and hands:</strong></em> Soles and palms may
look bluish and feel cold most of the time at first. This is
normal and does not mean a baby is too cold &#150; feel the body
to judge that.</p>
<p><em><strong>Eyelids:</strong></em> Eyelids can look puffy for
a day or two. Most babies are born with blue-grey eyes. It may be
six months before they acquire their permanent colour.</p>
<p><em><strong>Breasts:</strong></em> Breasts can be red and
swollen in the first few weeks, in both boy and girl babies. This
usually subsides without treatment.</p>
<p><em><strong>Umbilical cord: </strong></em>The stump of the
umbilical cord always protrudes at first, but soon shrivels and
falls off. If there is a slight discharge and bleeding from the
navel, continue caring for it as you were shown in hospital.
Don&#146;t hesitate to ask the doctor or nurse if you are
worried.</p>
<p><em><strong>Genitals:</strong></em> Genitals of both sexes can
look large at first. With girls the lips of the vulva are usually
swollen just after birth; a creamy pinkish discharge from the
vagina is not unusual and will soon stop. The scrotum in boys may
be swollen during the first few days but will settle.
Circumcision is no longer routine for boys. Talk this over with
your doctor.</p>
<h3><a name="Weight">Weight</a></h3>
<p>A baby usually loses weight during the first week or so,
possibly up to a tenth of birthweight. This is normal, and is
usually regained quite quickly.</p>
<h3><a name="Breathing">Breathing</a></h3>
<p>While you are in hospital, take notice of your baby&#146;s
breathing: then you will know what to expect when you are by
yourself at home. In the first few weeks it can vary, sometimes
rapid and other times quite slow. Sneezing and snuffling are
common at this age, and breathing can be noisy. Like all noises,
it seems louder at night.</p>
<h3><a name="Hiccups">Hiccups</a></h3>
<p>Most babies hiccup. It doesn&#146;t worry them so it
needn&#146;t worry you.</p>
<h3><a name="Bowels">Bowels</a></h3>
<p>The first few stools have a sticky consistency and look
blackish. They change to a lighter colour when feeding starts.</p>
<p>A breastfed baby&#146;s stools can vary from bright yellow to
greenish yellow; the texture is fine, but there may be whitish
flecks, like seeds. The smell is not unpleasant.</p>
<p>The bowel motions of a breastfed baby seldom need cause
concern. The numbers can vary tremendously &#150; from once a
week to one before and after each feed. All are perfectly normal
for a healthy baby.</p>
<p>A formula-fed baby&#146;s stools can vary from a creamy yellow
to khaki, depending on the formula. They are usually firmer than
with breastfeeding, but less frequent. There may be one or more
bowel motions daily, or even one every second or third day; it
doesn&#146;t matter while the stool is still soft. If it becomes
dry, hard and crumbly, offer 30 mL of boiled water between feeds
until you can ask your child health nurse about it.</p>
<h3><a name="Dummies">Dummies</a></h3>
<p>Unhappy babies can usually be soothed by cuddling, rocking,
talking and singing. However, if all else fails to comfort, you
may try a dummy; but strict cleanliness as for bottles and teats
is important. So-called &#147;cleaning&#148; the dummy in your
own mouth merely puts germs all over it. Some are better than
others for safety reasons; you can ask your child health nurse
about them.</p>
<h3><a name="BathTime">Bath Time</a></h3>
<p>You may be nervous about bathing your baby at first, even
though you have been shown how in hospital. Sometimes babies cry
a lot during bath time; it is still very strange for them.
However, if they are very distressed, just &#145;top and
tail&#146; them for a while. A small feed before bathing may
help.</p>
<h3><a name="RestandSleep">Rest and Sleep</a></h3>
<p>Rest on your bed as much as possible while in hospital, and
try not to do too much for a week or two when you arrive home.
Extra cleaning can wait for a while.</p>
<p>Broken nights are part of being a parent. A mother usually
feels constantly tired in the first months. With a new baby she
is &#145;on call&#146; 24 hours a day, and a routine is difficult
to establish.</p>
<p>Rest is so important that it is worthwhile organising your
time to include a nap during the day, to make the evening
bearable. You can feed baby lying on your bed.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="TheFamily">The Family</a></h3>
<p>Even the most welcome baby means some re-adjustment for
everyone in the family. Other children, toddlers especially, but
even the older ones, may take a while to adjust, and need
understanding and patience. It is difficult for them to have to
share you with another.</p>
<p>People want to help new parents, but their advice can be
confusing. Remember, no one knows your baby better than you do.</p>
<h3><a name="SafetyintheCar">Safety in the Car</a></h3>
<p>Your baby needs to be restrained safely whenever travelling in
the car. Never nurse a baby or small child in your arms in a
moving car, especially in the front seat. Should an accident
occur, it would be impossible for you to protect your baby from
injury.</p>
<p>Infant restraints are widely used and strongly recommended in
cars. Look for the Standards Australia approval mark on any
restraint you use. There are two Australian Safety Standard
marks. Approved products manufactured prior to 1989 will display
the S.A.A. 1754 mark. Those manufactured during or since 1989
display the A.S. 1754 mark.</p>
<p>Several models are approved for babies from birth to six
months. These include the Baby Safety Capsule and the Baby
Commuter for smaller cars. The Aprica Convertible, suitable from
birth to four years, is also available.</p>
<p>The Baby Safety Capsule and the Baby Commuter can be hired.
For details contact the Red Cross Infant Restraint Hire Service
on telephone (09) 325 5111.</p>
<p>The first car ride is the trip home from hospital &#150; so be
prepared.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HintsforHome">Hints for Home</a></h3>
<p>Forget about those unrealistic magazine photos of immaculate
homes. They always look as though no one lives in them.</p>
<p>If you find your spirits sagging about mid-morning, take the
time to pep yourself up with a milk or fruit drink.</p>
<p>Sitting down to the job is one of the best energy savers; for
instance, when you are preparing vegetables, cutting school
lunches, or folding washing. Plan rest periods during the day.
Even 10 minutes lying on your bed whenever you can is refreshing
for your mind and body.</p>
<p>It&#146;s easier to supervise toddlers if you rest on a couch
in the playroom, or in their bedroom. Give yourself a head start
with the washing by throwing a load in the machine at night,
ready to hang out early next morning. Cut ironing to a minimum
for now and maybe forever.</p>
<p>These and other helpful hints are combined in the leaflet
Survival Plan, which can be bought from the Nursing Mothers&#146;
Association of Australia. (See telephone directory.)</p>
<p>Your child health nurse can recommend suitable books and
provide you with booklets on child development and safety that
apply to your baby&#146;s age and stage.</p>

<h3><a name="SexualityAfterYourBaby">Sexuality After Your Baby</a></h3>
<p>How long you and your partner should wait before having
intercourse after childbirth depends on how you both feel. A lot
depends on how difficult the birth was for the mother. Mutual
agreement is a much better guide than the advice of friends or
others. Medically, intercourse is safe once the bright red blood
loss has ceased.</p>
<p>It is important for both of you to discuss how you feel and
any worries you may have about making love again. For about two
out of three women, there is a decline in sexual feelings,
behaviour and satisfaction. This may last several months.
Don&#146;t feel bad about it. Try to remember that a woman at
this time of her life still needs to be loved, wanted and
feminine.</p>
<p>Tiredness is a factor in a new mother&#146;s loss of sexual
feeling &#150; babies take a lot of looking after. Scar tissue
from episiotomies or tears, even though healed, can cause
discomfort during intercourse. Try varying the positions you use.
If you have painful scar tissue, ask your doctor to arrange
treatment by a gynaecological physiotherapist. </p>
<p>Due to altered hormones following childbirth, the woman&#146;s
vagina may seem dry because it is not lubricating as much as
before; this may last for about 12 months. KY Jelly, saliva, or
contraceptive foam, all readily available, can be of help.</p>
<p>For further information, ask your child health nurse for the
pamphlet <strong>&#145;Sexuality after Your Baby&#146;</strong>.</p>
<p>It is possible for a woman to become pregnant again as soon as
four weeks after a baby&#146;s birth. Your own doctor or a family
planning clinic can give you more information on avoiding an
unwanted pregnancy. Family planning clinics are conducted by the
King Edward Memorial Hospital and the Family Planning Association
of Western Australia. The Association conducts clinics at various
centres in the metropolitan area. For any information or
appointments, ring the Family Planning Association on (09) 227
6177. All consultations are strictly confidential.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GettingBackintoShapeandFitness">Getting Back into
Shape and Fitness</a></h3>
<p>Pregnancy, childbirth and caring for your baby cause stretch
and strain to your pelvic floor, stomach muscles, and your back.
It is important to give these parts of your body extra care in
the next few months so they become strong again and do not cause
problems in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Strong pelvic floor muscles prevent vaginal slackness and
        leaking of urine or faeces.</li>
    <li>Care of your back is needed in all activities at home and
        with your baby, to prevent acute and chronic back pain.</li>
    <li>Strong stomach muscles help towards a trim figure, and
        they support your spine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaflets <strong>&#145;Advice and Exercises after Your
Baby is Born&#146;</strong> and <strong>&#145;Pelvic Floor
Exercises&#146;</strong> show you how to get your body back to
full health. Make sure you get copies from the physiotherapist or
midwife at the hospital, or child health nurse in your locality.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>, practise pelvic floor exercises to
prevent vaginal slackness.</p>

<p>The aim of this and subsequent child development information
is to give some understanding of children's developing abilities
and a realistic assessment of what they can and cannot do.</p>
<p>Knowledge of child development will help parents to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>keep their children safe;</li>
    <li>help their children develop;</li>
    <li>understand their children's behaviour; and</li>
    <li>gain satisfaction and joy from this important role of
        nurturing their children.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>The rate of growth is not the same for all babies. Some will
be small, others bigger, but provided children are contented and
progressing, differences in weight gains between them are
inevitable and unimportant.</p>
<p>All babies develop skills in the same order, but all are
unique and progress at their own pace. It is amazing how broad
this spectrum of normal development may be.</p>
<p>Babies' early movements are uncontrolled, random responses.
They don't know yet that they have hands, legs, etc. or how to
control them.</p>
<p>By comparison, reflex movements &#150; sucking, breathing,
sneezing, swallowing and so on &#150; are not random responses.
They have survival value. In response to loud noises or to
suddenly feeling unsafe, babies may throw their arms out, stiffen
and cry. This reflex movement disappears within a few weeks.</p>
<p>All babies are able to learn from birth. They can hear, see,
feel, taste and smell and by using their senses will begin to
learn about their world and the people in it.</p>
<p>By one month they can already turn their head and eyes towards
light and will watch faces while being fed or talked to. They may
smile to indicate pleasure. Babies focus best on faces which are
quite close to them, about 20cm away. This is often called the
'cradling distance' and is the best of learning situations &#150;
close enough to hear, see and feel.</p>
<p>Gradually they become stronger and when placed on their tummy
can lift, not only their head, but their upper chest, using their
forearms for support. Floor time without a nappy will help.</p>
<p>Interest in people also increases. This is shown by visual
awareness of a person moving about the room. Social response to
nearby friendly faces is quick and they show their pleasure by
smiling and cooing. Joyful movements in anticipation of a bath or
similar caring routine suggest that they are beginning to know
what will follow.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SmokingandYourBaby">Smoking and Your Baby</a></h3>
<p>Because babies have very delicate airways that are sensitive
to smoke and the chemicals it contains, care should be taken to
protect them from tobacco smoke. Smokers should be discouraged
from smoking in a house &#150; certainly in the same room &#150;
where there is a baby. Infants exposed to passive smoking are
more likely to suffer from asthma, bronchitis, allergies, chest
infections and even Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), than
babies who breathe clean air.</p>
<p>If you are breastfeeding remember that some chemicals from
cigarettes are transmitted through breast milk. However, this is
not an excuse to stop breastfeeding as breast milk has many
excellent health benefits, including protecting against
infection.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="TheCryingBaby">The Crying Baby</a></h3>
<p>Crying is the only means of communication for babies and they
come well equipped to use it. Babies never cry for nothing,
always for a reason: they need something. Usually the need is
simple.</p>
<p>The crying may be due to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>discomfort caused by hunger, pain, being wet, hot or
        cold;</li>
    <li>the need for physical closeness;</li>
    <li>loneliness or fear;</li>
    <li>a need to suck &#150; sucking is comforting (longer
        sucking at feed times may help, or in some cases,
        offering a dummy); or</li>
    <li>parents' anxieties which they are quick to sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attention to obvious needs may settle them, but if crying
continues try:</p>
<ul>
    <li>extra cuddling or use of a baby sling;</li>
    <li>a change of position;</li>
    <li>a warm bath or shower and gentle massage;</li>
    <li>secure wrapping; or </li>
    <li>background noise, i.e. music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some babies tend to cry when they are put down, but if left
for a few minutes they will very often settle.</p>
<p>From parents' consistent response to their cries, babies will
learn quickly that they are loved and wanted, that someone can be
relied upon to respond to their needs. This in time will lead to
the development of a secure attachment to these special people
and a sense of trust.</p>
<p>The development of this sense of trust is said to be one of
the most important tasks of infant development.</p>
<p>The more time parents spend with their baby, the sooner they
will get to know each other. Babies will attach to whoever looks
after them most, as well as to other family members. The degree
of attachment is related directly to the amount of time the baby
spends with a person.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="PlayingandLearning">Playing and Learning</a></h3>
<p>Babies will get some play value out of every single, ordinary,
pleasant thing you do with them, from changing a nappy, bathing,
feeding or just being close.</p>
<p>During the first three months babies will learn to smile,
chuckle and coo, turn towards sounds and make a major discovery
&#150; that they have hands which can be used to reach out and
touch things.</p>
<p>Favourite playthings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>parents &#150; to feel, look at, listen to, taste and
        smell;</li>
    <li>colourful mobiles, leaves or curtains blowing in the
        breeze;</li>
    <li>a variety of sounds to listen to;</li>
    <li>pram rattles or objects dangled on strings to encourage
        coordination of hands and eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use your imagination to expand your baby's world.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Play is more than 'just fun' to babies. Play is
learning and practising what they have learned. It is finding
things out and exploring what they find. It is anything which
stimulates them to use their bodies and their senses and develop
their thinking and their intelligence.&quot; (P.Leach 1977)</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Immunisation">Immunisation</a></h3>
<p>Immunity to certain diseases can be developed by giving babies
small doses of specifically treated and therefore safe bacteria,
viruses or their products (vaccine). This results in the right
antibodies being produced. Once this is done, 'booster' doses at
appropriate ages maintain protection for many years.</p>
<p>This means that we can become immune to many serious diseases
without ever suffering from them and their likely side effects,
through this process of immunisation.</p>
<p>Your child health nurse can provide you with a leaflet
'Immunise Now' which explains fully what your child requires for
full protection.</p>
<p>Your child health nurse can also give you details on the
vaccination service available in your district. The Health
Department of Western Australia provides local authorities and
general practitioners with the vaccines at no cost. If preferred
your general practitioner will perform vaccinations, and an
administration charge may be made.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Breastfeeding">Breastfeeding</a></h3>
<p>Breastfeeding is nature's way of providing not only food, but
warmth, comfort, pleasure and security &#150; all those things
essential for the development of the child's self-esteem. Sucking
is pleasurable, comforting and reduces tension, while the
skin-to-skin contact of mother and child provides a feeling of
security, the feeling that one is not separate, not alone.</p>
<p>Feeding done at leisure provides an opportunity for the mother
to relax and enjoy her baby, as well as to give nourishment. New
mothers sometimes find they have 'so much to do' that they
experience some anxiety and feelings of stress. When they sit
down to feed, it is a time to forget about other tasks and to
devote themselves completely to being with the baby. Babies will
react to any feelings of unrest, worry or preoccupation in their
mother. If a baby is uneasy at the breast, it is usually because
the mother is not relaxed.</p>
<p>Primarily breastfeeding can be a pleasurable and valuable
experience for both mother and child and is best done in a calm
environment. Concern about supply or worry of any kind can be
counter-productive. Help is available from child health centres
and the Nursing Mothers' Association.</p>
<p>Older children need not be excluded from this activity.
Allowing them to be there, playing nearby perhaps, or curious,
interested and involved, will mean less likelihood of jealousy
and resentment of the new baby. They will need extra attention
and the reassurance that they are special too. Set up play things
nearby before feeding starts. If older children are included,
their interest in the proceedings is likely to lessen and they
will probably go back to their play.</p>

Series:</p>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ArtificialFeeding">Artificial Feeding</a></h3>
<p>If bottle feeding is chosen instead of breastfeeding, the baby
can still experience the same close and loving holding. 'Prop'
feeding is dangerous not only because of the risk of choking, but
also because it means that the baby is missing that important
early contact with the parents. Never prop feed, but always hold
the baby, first on one side and then the other, just as the
breastfed baby is moved from breast to breast. This will
stimulate both sides of the baby's body as in breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Contact your child health nurse for advice on formula feeding.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Parents'Needs">Parents' Needs</a></h3>
<p>The role of parents is to fulfil the needs of their children
(physical, emotional, intellectual and social). They provide and
they protect and, in the beginning at least, this is a
24-hour-a-day job. How the child's needs are fulfilled and by
whom doesn't really matter, as long as it is in a way that is
acceptable to both parents &#150; they have the right to choose.</p>
<p>When parents share the nurturing role, there is an opportunity
for both to have some time to themselves &#150; to relax, see
friends, perhaps go to a film or continue with hobbies or sports.
In this way there is less burden and so less cause for
resentment, complaint or dissatisfaction within the relationship.
Parents can each have time with their child and the child can
really get to know both parents. So everybody benefits!</p>
<p>Parents need to remember that they are important people too,
and need to spend time together as a couple. Occasional outings
without the baby are recommended.</p>
<p>It is always important to choose a reliable baby-sitter &#150;
preferably someone you know personally, or at least who has been
recommended to you.</p>
<p>From birth onwards the foundations are being laid for
personality growth. It is important that early experiences
provide the best possible basis for a child's future development
as a lively, stable, and responsible person, capable of giving
and receiving affection.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>Every year in Australia more than 700 children die from
accidental injuries. Thousands more are permanently scarred or
disabled (Kidsafe). Preventable accidents account for more
admissions to children's hospitals than any illness or disease.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility as adults to maintain a safe
environment for our children, to teach them safe attitudes and
behaviour, and to protect them from harm.</p>
<h3>To Keep Your Child Safe</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Babies early uncontrolled movements can propel them in
        unexpected directions. Never leave them unattended on
        tables, beds, etc.</li>
    <li>Never 'prop' the bottle, whether you are there or not. It
        is possible that milk may be regurgitated and/or inhaled.</li>
    <li>Always place your child in an approved child restraint in
        the car.</li>
    <li>Remove bibs at sleep time to prevent suffocation.</li>
    <li>Use thick, heavy gauge plastic sheeting in bassinets,
        cots and prams, and dispose of plastic with care.</li>
    <li>Remove any loose ribbons or trimmings on clothing and
        blankets.</li>
    <li>Use flat, firm mattresses and no pillows.</li>
    <li>Protect baby from the sun and heat.</li>
    <li>Make sure that no-one smokes around your baby as passive
        smoking can damage sensitive airways causing asthma,
        bronchitis, chest infections and Sudden Infant Death
        Syndrome (SIDS).</li>
    <li>Take special care with baby's dummy.<br>
        Check that:<br>
        - it has no ribbons or chains;<br>
        - it is in good condition &#150; no loose parts;<br>
        - there are holes in the flange which fits around the
        baby's mouth (if it does slip into the mouth, baby will
        be able to breath); and<br>
        - there is a ring attached for quick, easy removal from
        baby's mouth in an emergency.</li>

<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>By three months babies become more visually alert and are
attracted by nearby objects which move or are brightly coloured.
Curtains, leaves, shadows, mobiles, etc. will be studied intently
for a few minutes. You will notice that they now put their hands
together over the chest and study them thoughtfully. They will
then put them into the mouth for further exploration. At about
the same time babies will begin to produce more saliva and
dribbling will increase.</p>
<p>Progressively they become aware of and explore other parts of
the body &#151; chest, genitals, knees, toes, etc. Slowly they
learn &#145;what is me and what is not&#146;.</p>
<p>Some time during these three months, babies will learn to turn
over from tummy to back. Imagine their delight when, after
practising for weeks, they finally succeed and the entire view of
their surroundings changes. The ability to roll over and move
will develop more quickly (and safely) on a firm stable surface
such as the floor rather than a bouncy soft bed.</p>
<p>At first they may cry for you to help turn them back, but they
soon learn to do this for themselves and can move very quickly.</p>
<p>Most babies of this age will sleep less during the day than
they did previously, but probably for longer periods at night.</p>
<p><strong>TEETH</strong></p>
<p>Teeth are beginning to form in the baby&#146;s gums well
before birth. Eruption times, sizes and shapes of teeth are
determined by inherited make up. Babies may be born with a tooth,
or may be still toothless at 12 months and, whichever way, it
really doesn&#146;t matter. What does matter is the exposure to
any sweetened fluid or food such as honey, condensed milk,
sugared fruit juices, sweet biscuits or sweetened milk, etc.
These foods favour acid development in the mouth which can attack
tooth enamel and is the major cause of early dental decay.</p>
<p>Babies are conditioned by what they are given to eat and
drink. These early feeding patterns tend to remain throughout
life. For example, if all the fluids are sweetened, babies cannot
be blamed for preferring them to water.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="BabyasaSocialBeing">Baby as a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>Most babies will be starting to develop their own distinctive
personality by now. They may be placid, impatient, easygoing or
demanding. Most parents find that they feel differently towards
each of their children. Possibly to some extent this is because
each child is different and responds in an individual way. It is
important to realise that babies bring their own personal
contribution to the baby/parent relationship.</p>
<p>Probably the most outstanding characteristic is their
friendly, social behaviour towards everybody.</p>
<p>So sociable are they that sometimes babies of this age seem
almost to prefer playing to eating. Somehow they never come to
very much harm and in the quieter hours of feeding take enough
food to maintain good nutrition though weight increase may slow
down for a few weeks.</p>
<p>If their experience has been consistent with prompt response
to their cries, they will have learnt that they get fed when they
are hungry, cuddled when in need of comfort or reassurance and so
on. Four-month-old babies may stop crying and even smile when
parents are seen or heard approaching, knowing that their needs
will be attended to, and so begin to develop a sense of trust.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>What is fascinating about being a parent is watching and
helping babies to learn about themselves, their surroundings and
what can be done with them. Most babies, provided they are given
the opportunity, will show determined repetition of any new
activity until its possibilities have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Before three months, anything put in the hand only provided
experience in touching. From now on, babies will grasp and take
objects straight to the mouth, using this as a means of
investigation. This is the first example of using the mouth as an
important means of learning. The opportunity to learn is
obviously reduced by excessive use of a dummy. Later, babies will
examine things visually and match the information acquired from
touching, mouthing and watching. They will now reach out to touch
bright interesting objects, and toys that make a noise will be
shaken deliberately.</p>
<p>Opportunities to look, touch, mouth and listen will help them
to learn, and practising helps develop coordination.
Interruptions when playing contentedly alone (although welcomed
by babies), tend to encourage the need to be entertained by other
people rather than to play by themselves.</p>
<p>Playthings which match the baby&#146;s developing skills will
provide stimulation and enjoyment, e.g. bright colourful objects
suspended within baby&#146;s field of vision, strings of rattles
stretched across the pram or bassinet (within reaching distance),
a soft ball or &#145;texture block&#146; to grasp, a small
lightweight rattle to hold, etc.</p>
<p>All toys need to be durable, washable, with smooth edges, and
have no small beads or bells that could be swallowed. The average
baby&#146;s grasp is strong and they are quick and persistent.
Cuddly toys are best stuffed with old nylon stockings. Crumbed
plastic foam may be unsafe as children push pieces up their noses
or ears, or may even choke if it is swallowed. Fur toys are best
deferred until babies are older because of the intense interest
in mouthing.</p>
<p>Sounds are interesting now and babies&#146; own vocalising is
a new game. They will deliberately set about engaging attention
by smiling and &#145;talking&#146;. Their enjoyment is matched by
adults, because their obvious love of people is hard to resist.</p>
<p>Because babies enjoy them, bouncinettes and recliner chairs
are frequently used. They are cool and easily carried. For short
periods they can be useful, but they are no real substitute for
being held.</p>
<p>For baby, a rug on the floor is the best place to exercise,
learn how to control muscles and practise new skills. Baby
walkers are not recommended because they do not allow this to
happen. They can also be dangerous.</p>
<p>From this outline, it is evident that the baby&#146;s own
priorities are something like the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>first and most important &#151; people</li>
    <li>then the opportunity to learn and practise developing
        skills</li>
    <li>safety, which is linked with development in early
        childhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding development patterns helps parents to anticipate
the necessary precautions that must be taken to provide for their
baby&#146;s safety.</p>

<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>Six to nine months is a prime time for babies to develop hand
skills. They can now balance the head; they can almost balance
the body; they know how to grasp on sight, and are now eager to
try these rapidly growing abilities.</p>
<p>They are never idle; they have a compelling urge to handle and
explore things. They are building experiences that will help them
understand more about their surroundings. </p>
<p>Everything will be taken to the mouth now, including feet. If
things are dropped and fall out of sight, they do not look for
them. By about nine months, however, they will search in the
correct place for hidden objects and watch toys fall from their
pram or highchair. This is thought to be due to an increasing
awareness of distance and how things look as they fall, and the
noise they make when they land. Little escapes their notice. They
can focus on near objects and also follow the movements of people
and animals across a room.</p>
<p>They are surprisingly mobile - they roll front to back, and
learn quickly to roll back again, and may do this to reach an
interesting toy. Some babies circle more or less on the spot, so
are often frustrated because the toy is still out of reach.
During this time, most children will progress from sitting with
support to sitting by themselves. This leaves their hands free to
explore everything within reach. Secured in their highchair, they
can join the family at mealtimes and will enjoy trying to eat
with their fingers, although they cannot manage a spoon yet. They
will often accept a drink from a cup in imitation of adult
behaviour, although spilling is bound to happen.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>Gradually babies have gathered many impressions of people and
things. They can distinguish between the people they see every
day and less frequent visitors. Allow them time to observe
strangers from the security of a parent&#146;s arms before
advances are made towards them. Friends and relatives may need
reassuring that this apparent alarm at the sight of them is
nothing personal. It is part of an increasing comprehension of
the world around them.</p>
<p>Some babies of this age will cry bitterly if mother disappears
even for a short time. This does not mean that they are spoilt.
They do not understand yet that, even when she is out of sight,
she has not left forever. In the meantime, it will help if they
can hear or see their parents when they are awake.</p>
<p>Games where mother or father disappear and return - like
peep-bo - will help reassure and teach them that people and
things continue to exist even when they are out of sight.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p><em>Just as an appropriate diet is essential for normal
physical growth, so it is for mental development. The most vital
ingredients of this diet are play and language. Through them, the
child explores the work and learns to cope with it. Pringle 1980</em></p>
<p>Producing sound gives babies pleasure. They delight in shaking
rattles, crumpling paper with hands and feet and experimenting
with voiced sounds. High-pitched squeals please them and they may
stop and laugh at the noises they can make. They imitate, quite
realistically, the sounds they hear.</p>
<p>Syllables may be joined together - ma-ma, da-da and ba-ba and
the most usual combinations, but as yet they are still just
interesting sounds, not real words.</p>
<p>At first babies bring their toys towards themselves with a
scooping action using both hands. By about 6-7 months they can
grasp an object in one hand and pass it from hand to hand as they
examine it intently. Common household objects such as pegs, pots
and pans, etc. are of interest and they enjoy exploring their
possibilities. As they handle and mouth them, they begin to learn
about such things as warmth, coldness, roughness, smoothness,
softness, hardness and smell.</p>
<p>During this time their ability to pick things up will develop
from paw-like movement to poking at tiny objects with the
forefinger and then eventually to picking them up precisely
between thumb and forefinger.</p>
<p>Music is another form of communication. Singing and rocking
rhythmically are relaxing and comforting and both parents and
children enjoy this.</p>
<p>They will respond with delight to nursery rhymes that include
bouncing and clapping routines, and soon will imitate the actions
as they sing their own tune.</p>
<p>Books are important to everyone. Let them be important to
babies too. Now their eyes can focus they can look at a picture
book with you for a few seconds. Their concentration span is
brief. Choose a book that is not easily torn, has bright clear
colours and has only one simple object illustrated on each page.
They will learn to love books because they love that
&#145;reading time&#146; spent with you. This is, of course, no
substitute for conversation - which naturally also means
listening to and trying to understand their messages to you. Your
attention increases their interest in acquiring and practising
new sounds. You, as parents, are their first and most important
teachers.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SafetyChoiceofToys">Safety</a></h3>
<p><strong>Choice of Toys</strong></p>
<p>It is important to select toys that are safe and the younger
the child the more care is required. Check that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Toys with small or loose parts are kept out of reach.</li>
    <li>Dangling ribbons or elastic are removed. Blind cords
        within easy reach are dangerous.</li>
    <li>Eyes in all toys are securely fastened (remove if in
        doubt).</li>
    <li>Squeaks in soft squeeze toys cannot be removed.</li>
    <li>Teething rings and rattles will not break or come apart.</li>
    <li>There are no sharp edges or points.</li>
    <li>Toys are smoothly finished and free of splinters.</li>
    <li>Paint is lead-free. (In Australia and the U.K. only
        lead-free paints are used. This may not always be true of
        toys imported from other countries.)</li>
    <li>All stuffed toys are in good repair and inspected
        regularly. Choking or inhalation of foreign objects are
        amongst the commonest accidents in children under 12
        months of age.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="PlaypensandRestraints">Playpens and Restraints</a></h3>
<p>Mobility, though exciting for children, can also be hazardous.
When they must play alone, or parents are occupied with
activities such as cooking, washing or gardening, a playpen or a
safe area should be provided. However, free exploration under
adult supervision is still the best and most enjoyable learning
situation.</p>
<p>Leather or fabric restraints should be used always for prams,
shopping trolleys and highchairs. Plastic strips may stretch or
break and are therefore unreliable.</p>
<p>During the six to nine months period, most babies will learn
to sit without support, roll or crawl around on the floor and use
furniture to pull themselves up to stand.</p>
<p>Baby walkers are unsafe and not recommended. They can tip over
and they interfere with the baby&#146;s muscle development.</p>
<p>The desire to explore and learn about the world is very strong
and needs to be encouraged.</p>
<p>Keep your child safe by removing as many hazards as possible <strong>before </strong>accidents
occur.</p>

<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>From nine to 12 months, babies will probably develop the
ability to sit unsupported for quite a time. They can turn
sideways, or stretch out and pick up a toy from the floor,
without losing balance. The ability to move increases rapidly,
probably progressing from rolling or wriggling to crawling on all
fours. Some babies have their own individual crawling technique.
It may not be the conventional way, but they are more concerned
with reaching their goal than with how they make the journey.</p>
<p>When they first pull up on a support to stand erect, they will
not be able to lower themselves slowly back to a sitting
position. They may flop down or cry for help. But no sooner are
they down than they are back on their feet again. This will never
be more obvious than at nappy changing times. Gradually, they
will learn to walk, stepping sideways, using furniture for
support. They will progress to walking when their two hands are
held, then with only one hand held. They may stand for a few
seconds or even walk unaided by the time they are one year old.</p>
<p>Their ability to use their hands is developing rapidly. At
first, they will point and poke at small objects. They need to
practise their newly acquired throwing skills - and do so with
toys from the playpen or food from the highchair.</p>
<p>Their eating habits are also changing. Smooth foods are no
longer necessary since they can chew - with or without teeth! But
beware of hard foods, such as nuts, carrots or apple, which could
choke baby.</p>
<p>Some children will show a preference for certain foods. They
may enjoy finger feeding but need watching to ensure they
don&#146;t choke. At this stage, many are ready to make the
change from sucking to drinking from a cup. Frequent small drinks
(30 - 60 mL) give the pleasure of imitating adults and of
finishing a task. Cups are easier to clean than bottles and
eliminate the need for special equipment.</p>
<p>They are interested in all sounds and especially in voices -
their own and other people&#146;s. They love to babble for their
own amusement, but can also indicate what they want by pointing
and making sounds. Most babies produce their first word during
the tenth or eleventh month. However, first real words are
surprisingly difficult to identify from the sounds of constant
babble.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>Positive experiences with people are satisfying to babies.
They help them to develop confidence in themselves and a feeling
of being worthwhile. Anxiety hinders development. Curiosity,
exploration and learning can proceed when children know they are
loved and wanted.</p>
<p>A well-developed sense of trust in the first year lays the
foundations for a feeling of security that lasts for life.</p>
<p>Babies aged nine to 12 months are more confident socially,
although many object to new faces and strange voices. Later they
may still be distressed if parents leave for even a short time.
However, they can enjoy great social success because of their
obvious delight in the attention of familiar adults. They are
equally able to show their displeasure, and often do so by
throwing themselves backwards, stiffening the body and yelling.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>Playing is a happy way for children to learn about what they
can do and the world around them. It is important for them to
have a wide variety of play experiences. How much children enjoy
and learn will largely depend on you. Playing and talking with
your child can help and encourage development in a way
you&#146;ll both enjoy.</p>
<p>Games and play things which match children&#146;s developing
skills will encourage practice and give pleasure. Suitable games
for this age group include finger-toe songs and rhymes, games
such as beep-bo, clapping hands, and opportunities to listen and
copy the sounds they hear. Stimulating play things such as
pull-along toys, balls, drums, and objects that fit together like
stacking tubs, are best for this stage of development.</p>
<p>Opportunities to explore and experiment with their new
physical skills will help them to learn and keep them
entertained.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>A safe space to explore and play in is essential. Look around
your home and remove any potential hazards before your baby gets
into trouble.</p>
<p>Movement means opportunity. Children of this age no longer
need to wait for help. They can explore and even follow people if
they want to. Steps, doors and gates are very inviting. Water is
always an attraction - a hazardous one. This is a time when
parents need to be particularly watchful. Babies can move not
only fast but also silently.</p>
<p>Always check where your baby is before reversing the car.</p>
<p>Visually, children of this age are more interested in people
and in everything going on around them. They can now see and pick
up pins, flies, fluff, buttons and so on, and everything still
goes to the mouth. You have checked your own home, but take care
in other places too. In fact, it is probably safer to bring the
playpen on visits.</p>
<p>Restraints are more necessary than ever, as their
experimentations will extend to what can be done out of the
stroller and in, under, or over the highchair. Even when
restrained, active children can bounce a highchair or pram, or
manipulate a playpen into a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Low cupboards need to be secured. Heaters, fans, tablecloths,
occasional tables - all these are objects for small children to
pull themselves up, or to explore for what they can be made to
do. Prediction is impossible so constant care and protection are
more necessary than ever.</p>
<p>Babies of this age have no understanding of danger and no
knowledge of fire, poisons, height, depth, water, chemicals,
knives or electricity.</p>
<p>Cigarettes spell a special danger to inquisitive babies.
Cigarette butts and ash-trays can cause burns and even fires. It
should also be remembered that cigarettes are poisonous - medical
advice should be sought immediately if baby eats a cigarette.
Babies of all ages need protecting from passive smoking. Apart
from the danger of burns from a lighted cigarette in a
smoker&#146;s hand, a baby exposed to cigarette smoke can develop
sensitive airways leading to asthma, bronchitis and chest
infections.</p>
<p>The chances of injury increase as the child grows; hazards
multiply as the baby learns to crawl, walk, climb and explore.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ToKeepYourChildSafe">To Keep Your Child Safe</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Make the child&#146;s environment safe by:<br>
        &#151; storing household cleaning agents, medicines etc.
        well out of reach or, better still, in a locked cupboard<br>
        &#151; covering power-points when they are not in use<br>
        &#151; keeping kettle cords out of reach and opting for
        cordless or curly-corded kettles<br>
        &#151; placing dangerous objects out of reach<br>
        &#151; fencing off hazards such as swimming pools, fires,
        heaters and stairs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Use protective devices such as:<br>
        &#151; approved child restraints in the car<br>
        &#151; restraints when the baby is in the stroller,
        highchair or shopping trolley.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Keep smokers and ash-trays away from your baby! Protect
        baby from passive smoke as well as the dangers of lighted
        cigarettes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Teach your child to avoid dangerous situations. Children learn
best from copying what they see - let your child learn good
safety habits from you.</p>
<p>Remember that at 12 months, baby is due for immunisation
against measles, mumps and rubella, and for a third Hib
immunisation.</p>
<p>It takes a long time for children to remember and recognise
dangerous situations. In the meantime, keeping a constant watch
on them is the only way of making sure they are safe.</p>

<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>At this age most babies will be walking, talking and starting
to climb. Every day they discover different aspects of
themselves, and they want to explore the world around them.
Children learn from doing. It is important to let them try, and
to encourage and praise their efforts.</p>
<p>They enjoy movement for its own sake and are ceaselessly
active. Walking opens up new avenues for exploration. They can
reach and climb and are busy with constant inquisitive
investigations.</p>
<p>Dressing needs patience - they just cannot keep still. They
may begin to insist on doing some things for themselves, such as
taking off shoes or putting things on their head.</p>
<p>They want to feed themselves but the spoon is usually empty
and upside down by the time it reaches the mouth. It takes hours
of patience to learn this skill. Finger foods are an effective
way of allowing them to manage their own meals, and to encourage
this growing independence.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>It is interesting how children&#146;s dependence on their
parents decreases gradually through the second year. As they
learn more about people and the things around them, they become
more skilful at performing tasks themselves.</p>
<p>At this age, however, bursts of independent behaviour are
followed by insistent demands for their parents&#146; presence
and attention. These changes are often sudden, but they serve to
reinforce the child&#146;s feelings of security.</p>
<p>The struggle may show itself as contrary or even antisocial
behaviour at times. If parents can direct their disapproval at
unacceptable behaviour rather than towards the child, they will
encourage a sense of healthy independence and self-confidence. It
is better to say: &#147;What a mess - now we&#146;ll have to wipe
up all that split milk&#148;, rather than: &#147;You are so
naughty - look at the mess you&#146;ve made&#148;. In this way,
they are not made to feel that they are &#145;bad&#146; or
&#145;not loved&#146; as people. This way of commenting on
behaviour is difficult and requires practice and patience.</p>
<p>Genital exploration - or &#145;playing with oneself&#146; - is
a normal part of development. For children it is an extension of
exploring their bodies, feelings and sensations. Some parents who
feel uncomfortable about such behaviour want to distract children
and give them something else to play with; if so, this should be
done in an easy manner so children do not feel guilty or naughty.</p>
<p>The whole family benefits when father is at home. For the
child, it is a welcome change in play; for mother it is an
opportunity to hand over the responsibility of care. Sharing this
responsibility gives father and child the opportunity to talk and
play together - an important contribution to growing experience.</p>
<p>At this age, children understand familiar activities, such as
preparations for a bath or for an outing. Now that they are
becoming interested in watching things at a distance, they like
to play where they can see people and activity. They are often
content to amuse themselves until they hear movements, then eager
anticipation changes to joyous greeting if someone they know
appears. They may show shyness with strangers if they have not
done so previously but this will not last long.</p>
<p>However, they are still likely to return to mother and father
frequently for contact and reassurance. At the same time, they
begin to realise that it is possible for parents to go away and
not come back. This is a very frightening thought, and they keep
a close watch on parents. Threatening to leave to get children to
behave can increase this fear and make them more clingy.</p>
<p>This behaviour is particularly obvious in children attending
day care. It may help to prepare for this experience by leaving
them with a relative or friend for short periods.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>When children begin to crawl or walk, not only are they
developing their large muscles, but they are also acquiring
skills such as balance. They learn to negotiate steps and to
judge what spaces they can squeeze into or through, and what
obstacles they can climb over or crawl under.</p>
<p>They enjoy sharing nursery rhymes, books and songs with you.
They are listening to voices, practising sounds and words,
enjoying people and imitating what they do. Children of this age
have probably mastered three to five words, most of which you
alone will understand. They need to be with people who have the
time to talk, listen and respond to them, all of which will
encourage understanding and the use of words.</p>
<p>They need toys to cuddle, carry about and wrap up and objects
they can feel, examine and sort out. They need time to play in
the bath - time for fun. Finger and toe games, and dancing to
music will delight them. Grandparents too like to share the
baby&#146;s pleasure in these activities.</p>
<p>Children watch their parents, their likes and dislikes - the
way they talk with each other and the way they behave towards
each other. They are learning all the time and will copy what
they see. They are learning about love, affection and physical
contact, doors, wheels, cups, spoons, chairs and how these simple
objects that fill the world are used.</p>
<p>Things to suck and bite on are still needed, as are things to
make a noise with, things to float in the bath, things to drop,
and things to touch and smell.</p>
<p>This can be both a difficult and rewarding period for parents
as the toddler vigorously explores the surroundings. Regard for
safety is essential but care should also be taken not to prevent
learning. This can be done by providing a safe and stimulating
environment for play.</p>
<p><em>It is in the nature of the developing body to be
continually active, of the developing mind to be intensely
curious, and of the developing personality to seek good
relationships with other people. Mary D. Sheridan</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>At this age children are learning to walk, run and climb. They
are also very curious and need to explore their world. Their
rapidly changing interests may make it difficult to keep them in
sight, so it is obvious that a responsible adult needs to be
nearby. General safety precautions are now more important than
ever. Toddlers can get into trouble but do not know how to get
out of it. Their understanding of dangerous situations is very
limited, so that constant supervision is the only answer.</p>
<p>Telling children &#145;not to&#146; or otherwise stopping them
does not mean that they have understood the danger - or that they
will not return to complete their investigations. Consistent
removal of the baby or the dangerous object does. However, too
many &#145;don&#146;ts&#146; are as frustrating for them as for
you - keeping them to a minimum is best for everyone.</p>
<p>Their body control is developing but it is still poor. Their
coordination is insufficient for them to master their movements
reliably. They may collide with anything in their path; and in
trying to secure an item they want, may pull other objects on top
of themselves. Once started, movements such as running, drinking
or removing a hand are difficult to stop or reverse.</p>
<p>Statistics suggest that the following accidents are commonest
in this group to almost school age:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Falls (because their balance has not developed fully)</li>
    <li>Inhalation of food and other substances (because the
        reflex of closing the respiratory passages when eating is
        not developed yet)</li>
    <li>Burns and scalds (because they find it hard to remove
        their hand from a burning object)</li>
    <li>Poisoning (because they find it hard to stop drinking
        from a tipped container)</li>
    <li>Drowning (because their natural reaction to being in
        liquid is to curl up as in the womb)</li>
    <li>Motor vehicle accidents (because once they have started
        running they cannot stop when they reach the road).</li>
</ul>
<p>At this age, they frequently, and often unexpectedly, run off.
Leading reins may make shopping easier as well as safer for the
child, and less of a risk for motorists.</p>
<p>In the car, the safest place for toddlers is secured in their
seat in the back. This is also a legal requirement.</p>
<p>They still need 100 per cent adult protection. Consistent
guidance helps them begin to understand that certain behaviours
are dangerous. Like other skills, responsibility has to be
practised, and they have a long way to go.</p>

<h3><a name="ToKeepYourChildSafe">To Keep Your Child Safe</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lower the temperature of the hot water system to a medium
        or low setting, if possible.</li>
    <li>Store oven and drain cleaners in a locked shed with
        pesticides and swimming pool chemicals.</li>
    <li>Store medications and cleaning agents out of reach in a
        childproof cupboard.</li>
    <li>Buy and keep a bottle of Syrup of Ipecac in the house.</li>
    <li>Always ensure that your child is secured safely when in a
        cot.</li>
    <li>Insist your child remains restrained at all times when in
        a vehicle.</li>
    <li>Enclose the outdoor play areas your child uses.</li>
    <li>Check where your child is before reversing the car in the
        driveway.</li>
    <li>Always stay with your child near water containers of any
        kind (including nappy buckets and pools).</li>
    <li>Allow your child only those toys suitable for this age
        group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that 12 months of age is the time for your child to
have his or her first measles/mumps/rubella immunisation.</p>
<p>Your community health nurse or the Central Immunisation Clinic
of the Health Department, (09) 321 1312, has details.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>By now, the rapid growth of the first year of life has slowed
considerably and appetite has noticeably decreased.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of this age is increasing
independence and this will be very evident at meal times.</p>
<p>Children of this age enjoy drinking from a cup on their own.
However, they tend to tilt the cup too quickly and spilling often
occurs. They may demand to spoon-feed themselves but often accept
held towards the end of the meal.</p>
<p>Throwing objects is a favourite pastime at this age and these
children will fling anything. They are just developing this
complicated manoeuvre which, like any other important skill, they
must have the opportunity to practise. Because they now have the
ability to release an object voluntarily, they can place one
block neatly on top of another. They love moving things in and
out of containers - but seem to enjoy the dumping part the best.</p>
<p>They can, when they want to, assist with dressing by putting
their arms and legs into their clothes - but &#145;want&#146; is
the operative word. It is more likely that they will need to be
held bodily and worked into them. They are beginning to think
they don&#146;t always have to do as they&#146;re told. This is
quite important and exciting because it gives them the feeling
that they can make choices for themselves.</p>
<p>Speech too is developing rapidly. They jabber loudly and
constantly as they imitate conversational tones and phrases. They
will probably say two to twenty recognisable words in proper
context but can understand many more. They can also obey simple
requests if they feel inclined. As speech is one of the most
important developments in this second year of life, listening and
talking with them is essential.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>Now they can walk, there is such a lot to see and do that they
are almost totally absorbed in their own activities.</p>
<p>The parent&#146;s &#147;NO&#148; now falls on deaf ears as the
child concentrates on the job at hand. However, concentration
span is short at this age, and children pass rapidly from one
occupation to the next which is just as absorbing. Suddenly, they
are trying to do so much, so quickly and so constantly, that
there isn&#146;t a moment to spare.</p>
<p>Providing the initial approach is left to them, they will
greet friends or strangers - human or animal - in the same joyous
way. Their natural curiosity drives them energetically into every
new situation.</p>
<p>Every day they discover something different about themselves
and their world. They want to try things on their own and can be
boldly demanding.</p>
<p>It may take them time, but children learn by doing. So
it&#146;s important to encourage and praise their efforts. Also
do a quick &#145;survival check&#146; to see you are one step
ahead of their rapid development and have removed safety hazards
around the house.</p>
<p>They love and need to be near people. (They are not really old
enough to play with other children their own age although they
may happily play beside them.) These children love to imitate.
They will learn much from watching you and copying what you do.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>One of the most important yet least understood roles that
parents ever undertake is that of fostering the intellectual and
social development of their children - parents are their
children&#146;s first and most important teachers.</p>
<p>This can be both a difficult and rewarding period for parents
as toddlers energetically explore their surroundings.</p>
<p>Safety is essential but care must be taken not to prevent
learning. This can be done by providing a safe and stimulating
environment for them to play in, where they:</p>
<ul>
    <li>can feel secure and confident;</li>
    <li>are safe from hazards, but free to explore;</li>
    <li>have new experiences provided so that they can be
        actively involved;</li>
    <li>are given praise and encouragement for their efforts;</li>
    <li>have play things to match their stage of development;</li>
    <li>are able to spend time with parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is of interest and they learn something from
everything. Because they are attracted to the world outside, they
enjoy watching movements through a window, and shout to anyone
going by. Playing provides challenge for the body, mind and
imagination.</p>
<p>They can relax; they can be boisterous; they can be serious,
they can have glorious fun, all in a matter of minutes.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SomePlayIdeas">Some Play Ideas</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sand Play</strong></p>
<p>A sandpit should be situated where parent and child can see
other, and be at least 50cm deep if it is to be useful for a few
years. If it is surrounded by a wooden frame (railway sleepers
are excellent but make sure they are carefully sandpapered to get
rid of splinters) it provides seating and a table for sand cakes.
White sand - such as beach sand - is preferable, as yellow tends
to become very hard. Although it is illegal to remove sand from a
beach, this does not apply to sand blown on car-parks and
pavements. Different sized tins, an old sieve, old plastic jugs
and wooden spoons are all useful sand play tools. Make sure the
sandpit is covered at night to keep out cats and dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Walks</strong></p>
<p>Walks, rather than drives, can be a great experience. They
provide opportunities to feel grass or sand or puddles; follow a
path; climb over logs; and see water, birds, animals and insects.</p>
<p><strong>Books</strong></p>
<p>One clear familiar object on each page is still preferable at
this age, but your child may be showing an interest in more
detailed pictures or simple stories about everyday activities.
Sharing a book with someone is what these children enjoy most.</p>
<p><strong>Toys for Sorting and Placing</strong></p>
<p>Shoe boxes can hold many treasures. They may be covered in
plastic contact or painted in bright colours. Fill them with
shells, gumnuts, cotton reels, tin lids (not sharp), square
building blocks, pegs and different stones. All of these must be
too big to be swallowed.</p>
<p><strong>Toys to Handle and Fit Together</strong></p>
<p>&#151; Nests of tins painted in different colours (make sure
there are no sharp edges)<br>
&#151; Hammer toys<br>
&#151; Saucepans and lids and other kitchen utensils<br>
&#151; Plastic containers in the bath.</p>
<p><strong>Toys to Push and Pull</strong></p>
<p>&#151; Large balls<br>
&#151; Box on wheels<br>
&#151; Strong cardboard boxes (big enough to get into).</p>
<p><strong>Toys to Cuddle and Hug</strong></p>
<p>&#151; Stuffed animals<br>
&#151; Rag dolls</p>
<p><strong>Nothing other than supervision can prevent accidents.
Know where your child is at all times.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>Tots this age are intensely active and need a very high level
of protection. Though the house has apparently been made safe,
they always seem to be able to find a new trouble spot.</p>
<p>They can climb now, so a few extra barrel bolts high on doors
and gates may be well worthwhile. Storage arrangements for
medicines, etc. need to take account of their climbing skills. Or
you can have a cupboard with childproof locks installed.</p>
<p>Balancing is still a problem and toddlers can have many falls.
Most of these are not important, and won&#146;t even hurt enough
to discourage them from trying again a few minutes later.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming pools</strong> are a special hazard wherever
located. It cannot be emphasised too strongly that any pool -
anywhere - needs to be regarded as a constant danger both to your
own and other people&#146;s young children. The safest pool is
one completely separated by fencing from house and play areas.
But remember, there is no substitution for constant supervision
and protection.</p>
<p>This is sometimes described as the age of dart and fling and,
although these children will resent any type of restraint, a
leading rein is still a good idea when walking in any area where
road traffic could be hazardous, or in the local supermarket. A
restraint clipped to either side of the shopping trolley will
prevent a youngster on the toddler seat from standing and
falling. This leaves the parent&#146;s mind and hands free for
shopping.</p>
<p>Toddlers still need full adult supervision to stay safe
because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>their reflexes are slow;</li>
    <li>their body movement coordination is still developing;</li>
    <li>they have not acquired likes and dislikes of taste and
        smell;</li>
    <li>they are unable to lift their bodyweight up and out of
        danger;</li>
    <li>they have short-term memory only;</li>
    <li>they cannot predict events;</li>
    <li>they have no understanding of the dangers of high places
        or deep holes, and are still learning to judge distances.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children must be protected when too young to understand these
dangers, and taught safety practices as soon as they are able to
understand.</p>

<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>Because 18-month to two-year-old children are going through a
period of slow physical growth, weight gain will be great.</p>
<p>They are beginning to try to control the world around them -
including you, so they are likely to insist on using a spoon and
refuse to be fed. They usually manage a cup well, holding it with
both hands and tilting it, and spill very little. Sucking is no
longer important to the child, therefore bottle feeding is
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Eighteen-month-old children can move like quicksilver. They
like to carry objects from one place to another and back again.
This to-and-fro movement is much less aimless than it seems.</p>
<p>How can you discover without exploring? How can you explore
without travelling? How can you find out where you started
without going back? Gessel</p>
<p>Each activity achieved, however small, is a personal triumph;
for example, helping to empty the shopping basket, putting a few
groceries away or drying the spoons and placing them in their
drawer.</p>
<p>These youngsters need to do things for themselves. They learn
by doing and looking, not by being told. They are more likely to
cooperate if you give them something interesting to hold and
examine, rather than just telling them to &#145;stand still and
don&#146;t touch&#146;.</p>
<p>At this age, they see other children as &#145;something
interesting&#146;, and will pull, pinch, poke, push and pat them
in the same way that they would handle objects. This may
sometimes appear aggressive, but it is just their normal,
energetic, boisterous approach.</p>
<p>In the months ahead they will progress from saying a few words
to using simple sentences. They talk to themselves all the time,
experimenting with tones and rhythms, especially during play.
They may not yet know enough words to hold a conversation, and
speech may not be used although they understand just about
everything that is said. They may grasp your hold to show things,
and point to things they want, accompanying this with urgent
noises or a single word. By responding to their child&#146;s
attempts to talk, and guessing at what they are trying to say,
parents can reward their child&#146;s effort and encourage them
to keep trying.</p>
<p>Picture books will help language development. Toddlers can
enjoy visits to the library and can be encouraged to pick books
for themselves.</p>
<p>At about two, though they understand what they are asked, they
are likely to do the opposite. When it is time to go home, they
are apt to walk the other way. Sometimes you can persuade them by
saying &#145;Let&#146;s go to see Teddy or Pussy&#146;, or
whoever is prime favourite at the time. Threatening to leave them
is frightening and makes them very anxious.</p>
<p>They will probably be able to point to, and perhaps name, some
parts of their body, and it&#146;s fun to find these on other
people too. They enjoy simple nursery rhymes and may try to join
in by echoing the last words of each line. If you are singing,
they may hum and sway to the rhythm.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>Children at this age usually spend most of their time playing
by themselves. But all the sensations they feel and the
observations they make add to their knowledge of life. They
cannot understand yet why things happen, but nothing that happens
escapes their notice.</p>
<p>Socially, they are barely acceptable because they so enjoy
&#145;getting into&#146; everything. Pushing buttons on the TV,
emptying baskets and answering the telephone are all legitimate
activities in their eyes. When they tire, they become less
tolerant of interference and a sit-down temper tantrum is likely.
This is quite normal behaviour at this age. The unhappy situation
can often be solved by picking them up and diverting their
attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>If some of their things have their own place in each room,
this may help them to understand what is theirs and what is not.
With a bit of luck they may go to their own possessions first and
only to other people&#146;s when the possibilities of their own
are exhausted (this is the theory anyway). They cannot, however,
be trusted not to interfere with other people&#146;s belongings.</p>
<p>Even though their span of attention appears to be short, they
are constantly watching people and how they behave, and learn
much more than we realise. They are becoming interested in
household activities, and enjoy mimicking sweeping or dusting.
They are equally able to imitate other adult behaviour that they
find interesting. Their imitation of the angry adult can be very
realistic.</p>
<p>Truthfully, they are tiring to live with, and it is very
important to realise that parents need other adults for
companionship sometimes. If the child spends some time with a
grandparent or other caregiver, or at a child care centre, this
time apart can be of value to both child and parents.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>Toddlers&#146; attention is likely to wander so that they play
with many things in a short while. They want everything NOW, but
as time passes, they may begin to respond to &#145;wait a
minute&#146;.</p>
<p>Many small children refuse to go to sleep without their
favourite toy or blanket. When they are tired or in trouble, it
can be a great comfort. They are beginning to recognise ownership
and will return articles correctly - a bag to mother or shoes to
father. This beginning of understanding of ownership is very
important. They have to experience &#145;owning&#146; or having
something belonging to them before they are able to share. This
applies especially to sharing an adult&#146;s attention. If they
know that each day mother will have a special time for them
alone, they may gradually tolerate interruptions at other times,
such as those that occur when a new baby appears.</p>
<p>Help in tidying their toys may encourage them to understand
that orderliness has value. If their toys are always returned to
the toy box, then that is where they will be found tomorrow. Of
course, this will take time, repeated encouragement and
consistency on your part.</p>
<p>Most toddlers seem to have unlimited stores of energy that can
mean trouble if it is not used in &#145;permitted&#146;
directions. A few objects in the backyard - balls, small
cardboard cartons, a sandbox with some interesting utensils -
will occupy them happily.</p>
<p>Frequent walks - even if you need to use reins - are enjoyed
by both parents and children, especially if they can be allowed
&#145;off&#146; in an open space, such as a park. Just walking
round the block can be full of interest for curious, energetic
toddlers.</p>
<p>Ball games are always a favourite and toddlers gradually
become more skilled at directing the ball where they want it to
go, such as into a tipped carton. Rolled-up newspaper held with
sticky tape makes a useful ball for fun-throwing. You can give
them three or four. With care, these may be used indoors
(wrapping paper on the outside will prevent grubby hands and
protect walls from newsprint).</p>
<p>Hand puppets are great fun, especially furry ones. Adult
&#145;puppet talk&#146; will help both language and listening
skills to develop.</p>
<p>Playthings such as building blocks, simple wooden jigsaw
puzzles, posting boxes, stacking toys, screw toys and sorting
games not only encourage manipulation skills, but also teach
small children to concentrate, focus attention, understand how
things work, and to remember.</p>
<p>With mastery of skills comes a sense of achievement and pride
- a wonderful building block towards self-esteem.</p>
<p>Picture books with simple everyday objects such as animals,
household items, cars, boats and familiar things are fun. They
will also encourage language development, and increase the
child&#146;s understanding of the world. Ask your community nurse
for leaflets on play.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>As children grow and develop new skills, hazards increase
within the environment. With the ability to run, climb, open
cupboards, twist taps on, twist lids off and so on, their
never-ending curiosity and energy will lead them continually into
potentially dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Often accidents occur when parents are not aware of their
child&#146;s capabilities at that specific stage of development;
they are &#145;out of tune&#146; with their child&#146;s needs,
growth and level of understanding.</p>
<p>Periodic discussions with your community child health nurse
will help you to keep pace with, or better still one jump ahead
of, your child.</p>
<p>Don&#146;t forget that the fourth Triple Antigen and Hib
injections are due at 18 months.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ToKeepYourChildSafe">To Keep Your Child Safe</a></h3>

        child restraint whenever travelling by car.</li>
    <li>Keep medicines and household poisons in a locked
        cupboard.</li>
    <li>Cover power points when they are not in use.</li>

<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>During this year, weight and height will increase at about the
same rate as in the previous 12 months (i.e. height increases by
about 8-10 cm and weight by 2-3 kg).</p>
<p>Toddlers have spent the past few months practising and
coordinating their bodily movements. Walking is nearly perfect
and most of them are running safely. Falls are common, partly
because they are top heavy and partly because they do not have
the ability to avoid obstacles in their path quickly. These
difficulties sort themselves out with practice and by their third
birthday toddlers go up and down steps, may tricycle with great
ease, kick or throw a ball and jump from small heights.</p>
<p>By this time too they are able to pick up tiny objects with
thumb and forefinger, and enjoy scribbling with a pencil and
looking at picture books.</p>
<p>They understand most of what is said but the number of words
that each individual child can say varies greatly. Some can form
short sentences and easily make their needs known, while others
are barely past the &#145;pointing and hoping to be
understood&#146; stage. For the latter, life will still be full
of frustrations and this indicates a delay needing assessment.</p>
<p>Listening and taking notice of what they say is probably one
of the best contributions parents can make to help language
develop. The more they are talked with, the more words they
learn. The more words they know, the more clearly they can think,
and the less frustrated they become. By listening to what they
say we show them that we consider their opinions to be
worthwhile. This confirms the feeling of being an independent and
individual person. It is also important that they feel this
emerging self is a good person to be.</p>
<p>By the time they are three their behaviour has changed again
and they seem very much more &#145;grown up&#146;. They may now
enjoy making choices between two alternatives. They listen
attentively and seem to want to please.</p>
<p><em>&#147;Language helps children to learn to reason, to think
and to understand the world around them; speech facilitates the
making of relationships, both with adults and with
contemporaries; and verbal communication is and remains a vital
means of coping and coming to terms with life&#148;. Mia Kellmer
Pringle.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>Socially, toddlers are not advanced. They are more interested
in things than in other children. Having no sense of property and
being self-centred, they tend to come into strife with their own
age group.</p>
<p>Two-year-olds are not really old enough to share play with
other children their own age, although they may happily play
beside them. They love, and need to be near, people whom they
will watch, listen to and imitate.</p>
<p>Crying is still their main method of protest and, if
frustrated, temper tantrums are a normal expression of anger.
They often fear loud noises, animals, strangers and falling.</p>
<p>By now they help with dressing and undressing and by their
third birthday many can do it for themselves if allowed to.</p>
<p>Remembering things is difficult and getting muddled about
instructions is common.</p>
<p>Their ability to make a choice is still limited. However,
where before they could see only one way, now everything has an
alternative.</p>
<p>They will not tolerate change nor accept interruption. They
cannot be forced. If parents persist, the result may be a temper
tantrum from which it is more difficult to distract them.</p>
<p>Some don&#146;ts are important and must be enforced. However,
with some thought, some other way can often be found and
acceptable behaviour redirected.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Tantrums">Tantrums</a></h3>
<p>Many tantrums can be prevented by avoiding situations that are
known to create frustration and boredom, such as going to the
supermarket. It may be better, at this stage, to leave your
toddler with a friend or at a child care centre when you go
shopping. Frustrations breed tensions, and tantrums are one way
of relieving feelings. All strong feelings are better expressed
then bottled up. For children who cannot yet express anger in
words, this is the obvious way to act out their feelings.</p>
<p>As children learn to express their feelings in words and begin
to gain control of their emotions, temper tantrums tend to
subside. Either to reinforce their anger with your own or to
reward by giving in to their wishes is likely to prolong this
sort of behaviour.</p>
<p>It is best for adults to ignore the situation if possible, but
be aware of the risk of harm to the child. When the tantrum is
over a cuddle and reassurance from you will help the child to
know they are still loved.</p>
<p>To completely lose control of oneself is frightening,
particularly for a child who is striving for independence.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>Early experiences and the encouragement or otherwise that
toddlers receive from their parents have been shown to be far
more important than previously realised. Much of their attitude
to learning &#150; which later affects what they learn at school
&#150; is established by the age of four and a half.</p>
<p>Play is so essential that its importance can&#146;t be
overstated. This is the way they begin to get some understanding
of many things, including size, weight, length, volume. Take
water, for instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It can be hot, warm or cold.</li>
    <li>Poured on the ground, it runs away, but it behaves
        differently in the bath or on the floor.</li>
    <li>Poured into a container, it takes the container&#146;s
        shape and reshapes when poured into a different one.</li>
    <li>It can be clear, coloured, muddy.</li>
    <li>It can be frozen solid, and then melt.</li>
    <li>Bubbles can be blown in it.</li>
    <li>Some things sink in it, some float.</li>
    <li>It is used to wash in; to make tea; boats sail on it and
        fish swim in it.</li>
    <li>It can be the beginning of understanding such things as
        little, big, full, empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is endless. There are many other exciting discoveries
about water and other things which children will make and be
eager to share with you.</p>
<p>Watching children play may help adults understand how they are
thinking and may also give adults a fresh perspective on familiar
things. Given the opportunity, children will find out some of
these things for themselves. Some they can only find out with
your help.</p>
<p>A balance between helping too much or too little is important
in order to encourage them to try, without experiencing too many
failures. Your pleasure in their achievements will always spur
them on to further effort. The pleasure they get from their
performance helps to make them feel good too, another valuable
boost to their developing self-esteem.</p>
<p>Ask your community child health nurse for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>more play ideas</li>
    <li>information regarding play groups in your area</li>
    <li>play leaflets and the Play Information Mobile Service
        (P.I.M.S.)</li>
    <li>toy library locations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>Continuous supervision is still required as children under
three cannot foresee possible dangers. Though they seem to
understand so much of what is said to them, they are not yet
capable of taking responsibility for their own safety.</p>
<p>The outside world is now full of interest; doors and gates
need to be secure to protect the child from dangers associated
with vehicles, pools, or even undesirable people.</p>
<p>Cigarettes spell a special danger to inquisitive toddlers.
Cigarette butts and ash-trays can cause burns and even fires, and
it should also be remembered that cigarettes are poisonous &#151;
medical advice should be sought immediately if a child eats a
cigarette. All young children need protecting from passive
smoking. Apart from the danger of burns from a lighted cigarette
in a smoker&#146;s hand, a child exposed to cigarette smoke can
develop sensitive airways leading to asthma, bronchitis and chest
infections.</p>
<p>At home, too, they are wanting to be more independent, and
things like matches, knives, scissors, electrical equipment and
poisons need to be kept safely out of their way.</p>
<p>The most common type of accidents occurring to children of
this age group are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scalds/burns</li>
    <li>Falls</li>
    <li>Ingestion of poisonous substances</li>
    <li>Motor vehicle accidents</li>
    <li>Drowning</li>
    <li>Cutting and piercing.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can help prevent accidents by ...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Always insisting that your child remains in an approved
        child restraint whenever travelling in a car.</li>
    <li>Keeping medicines and garage, garden, pool and household
        chemicals in locked cupboards.</li>
    <li>Fencing your swimming pool with an approved fence and
        self-locking gate.</li>
    <li>Staying with toddlers at all times when they are in or
        near water, e.g. pool, dams, rivers, ocean, bath with
        water in and paddling pool.</li>
    <li>Turning the temperature of the hot water system down to
        50&#176;C now that taps can be easily turned.</li>
    <li>Screening open fires or heaters and locking away matches.</li>
    <li>Keeping your child away from smokers (passive smoke) and
        ash-trays. Cigarettes (and cigarette butts) are
        poisonous.</li>
    <li>Dressing your child in close-fitting clothes before
        attending a barbecue.</li>
    <li>Supervising all play with ropes and toys with strings,
        such as pull-along toys.</li>
    <li>Always knowing where your child is, whether indoors or
        outdoors.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Children change and grow up rapidly. They do not transform
themselves overnight, turning from caterpillars to butterflies
under your eyes, but this particular change from toddler to
preschool child, whether it takes place at 2&#189; or 4, does
have a sudden and magical quality. Penelope Leach</em></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GrowthandDevelopment">Growth and Development</a></h3>
<p>Between the third and fifth birthday, height increases by 13
to 14 cm and weight by 3&#189; to 6&#188; kg. These gains are
likely to be lower for girls.</p>
<p>Children&#146;s initiative grows as they explore their world
of people and things. They start looking for reasons, answers,
causes, solutions and new ideas. Recognition of effort encourages
them to try harder. They want to accomplish tasks that they set
for themselves and may resent offers of help.</p>
<p>Parents&#146; continuing help in what they are doing is
important. This will have far-reaching effects on how they manage
at school later on.</p>
<p>Until recently, very little had been written about the
father&#146;s influence on young children. A man&#146;s way of
interacting with infants and children provides a unique
contribution to a child&#146;s experience of human relationships.
In a family where the father is absent, male relatives or friends
can help to provide this.</p>
<p>At this age a child may acquire an imaginary playmate &#150;
animal or human &#150; to share the joys and problems of life.
The existence and rights of a &#145;friend&#146; are defended,
often strongly, and the whole family has to accept this, even to
leaving the most comfortable chair vacant if the
&#145;friend&#146; is using it. It should not be taken as an
indication that a child is lonely or &#145;odd&#146;.</p>
<p>Children still find difficulty in accepting responsibility for
their own bad behaviour. It may be easier to blame the
&#145;friend&#146; until they are mature enough to acknowledge
their own mistakes.</p>
<p>Three-year-olds are likely to be physically competent. They
may ride tricycles expertly, turning corners without having to
slow down, and climb play equipment confidently. About this time
they can manage the intricate art of cutting with scissors, use a
fork and spoon, wash hands (though they still need help drying
them), and pull their pants down and up (but they still need a
hand with buttons).</p>
<p>Because of the tremendous drive to develop physical skills
such as climbing, balancing, running and kicking, they need to
have the opportunity to &#145;run wild&#146; out of doors
whatever the weather. For the very active child, encouraging this
vigorous play will mean a happier household for everyone.</p>
<p>Four-year-olds gradually progress from climbing on household
furniture and simple play apparatus to becoming expert on
ladders, trees or anything else that interests them. Though they
will need supervision, generally they will attempt to climb only
what they can manage safely. However, it should be kept in mind
that some adventurous children may be able to get up, but not to
get down, alone.</p>
<p>In their quieter moments they may show more interest and
enthusiasm for play which involves fine hand movements, such as
drawing, painting and building. These activities are forerunners
to writing skills and may also be a source of great pride and
satisfaction. Displays of kindergarten creations are familiar
decorations in many kitchens! Giving these place of honour is
important because it shows children their efforts are appreciated
and helps encourage their development.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsaSocialBeing">As a Social Being</a></h3>
<p>One of the most delightful age groups in preschool children is
three years or thereabouts. As their own fluency improves they
start to enjoy conversations with an adult. Helping with whatever
is going on is one of their greatest pleasures.</p>
<p>They begin to notice sex differences and may ask about them.
They need to be told the proper names for body parts, such as
penis for a boy or vagina for a girl. Competition in urinating is
common and little girls too will often try to pass urine standing
up.</p>
<p>To &#145;wait awhile&#146; is now a possibility, but patience
should not be tried too far. They are capable of showing
sympathy, can show affection for younger children, and would
rather please you than not. They may even begin to understand
about taking turns, but do not expect too much from them.</p>
<p>However, the latter part of this year may not flow so
smoothly. Whingeing, demanding and blaming mother for anything
that goes wrong are frequent symptoms of this stage of
insecurity. Imaginary fears are also common. They may be afraid
of such things as the dark, wild animals or noisy machinery. A
bandaid may be demanded for even the slightest scratch.</p>
<p>Nail-biting, blinking, masturbating or thumb-sucking are
common and may worry you. If so, discuss your concerns with your
child health nurse. Behaviour in a social situation is
unpredictable. They can be shy today and &#145;show-offs&#146;
tomorrow. Feelings are easily hurt by failure or by being
ignored, and they may try to protect themselves from this with
&#145;no&#146; or &#145;I can&#146;t&#146;. These are all just
signs of the general disorganisation of this age and will pass
with time. Your patient support will help.</p>
<p>Four-year-olds are always wanting to be doing. &#147;Let me
...&#148; The three-year-old&#146;s &#147;what&#148;,
&#147;where&#148; and &#147;who&#148; questions will now be
changing to &#147;why&#148;, &#147;when&#148; and
&#147;how&#148;. This is an indication that they are trying to
understand the world around them.</p>
<p>Their ability to manage ordinary tasks effectively is well
demonstrated by their mealtime behaviour. They use a spoon and
fork, and later a knife, quite efficiently. They are not so
likely to dawdle and will enjoy taking part in mealtime
conversations.</p>
<p>One often hears them giving themselves instructions before
starting or stopping things that are difficult for them. In time
they will no longer need to do this.</p>
<p>They are, if anything, even more independent than before and
not only undress, but dress themselves. Not unexpectedly, this
independence is shown in their behaviour by assertiveness and
sometimes impertinent refusals to do as they are asked. They
will, however, gradually become more self-controlled.</p>
<p>Not only will they understand about taking turns, but they
will be far more cooperative with their friends, and accept the
need for rules and for fair play.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="LearningthroughPlay">Learning through Play</a></h3>
<p>Children learn through play. It is their &#145;work&#146; and
helps them develop physical, mental and social skills. Children
need to explore, experiment, and experience as widely as possible
a variety of play activities. By providing these opportunities,
we not only help our children develop, but also create a happier
child and family. There are play possibilities in everyday things
for the parent with a &#145;playful&#146; eye.</p>
<p>Make-believe and domestic play are very important during these
years, and this becomes gradually more and more complex and
planned. Preschoolers are able to carry images of situations and
objects in their minds, increasing their ability to play
imaginatively.</p>
<p>This imaginative play is an exploration of other people and
their roles. Acting out situations will help them in later life.
The fireman needs a hat and the doctor or nurse a stethoscope.
Give them a variety of hats. Their imagination will do the rest.
With imagination a small, open cardboard box can be a spaceship,
a train, a car or a house. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Adults should not join in this play unless at the child&#146;s
invitation. They will probably only be asked to play minor roles
as guest, assistant, or supplier of needed props. Other children
of the same age who can share ideas will stimulate other
activities, and help to play and act out new make-believe
adventures. If other children are not available, care and
planning by concerned adults can provide new experiences, visits
and fresh play materials.</p>
<p>If allowed, preschoolers may be very keen to help with such
household jobs as unpacking groceries, washing and drying dishes,
preparing vegetables and making cakes. Although it may take
longer for you, this is the way children learn and practise
skills they will need later on. So spend some time turning
housework into houseplay!</p>
<p>Sharing a bedtime story at the end of the day can provide
great enjoyment for children and parents alike. Children love
stories about familiar objects, such as cars or trucks, and
animals. You can buy books or borrow them from libraries.
Children also enjoy making their own &#145;special&#146; books or
stories. By sharing a bedtime story you will increase your
child&#146;s knowledge and vocabulary. Even more important, you
will create a warm, secure feeling at the end of the day. For
more information on play, ask your child health nurse for a
P.I.M.S. pamphlet.</p>
<p>This is a good age to encourage the development of listening
skills. Focus their attention by asking them to sit quietly,
watch you, and listen to a story. Call their attention to new
sounds in their environment: &#147;What was that sound?&#148; or
&#147;Where is that bird?&#148; Children at this age enjoy
reading familiar stories, rhymes and songs with you over and over
again. Encourage good listening by having the younger child
complete the familiar sentence you have started or filling in the
missing words. The older child will be able to retell the story
from a book or children&#146;s video.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>
<p>Rapidly improving physical skills like running, jumping and
climbing give the child freedom and opportunities for adventure
&#150; freedom to do things that &#145;other children&#146; do,
to do things &#145;by myself&#146;. These new freedoms increase
the chances of accidents. While it is the parents&#146;
responsibility to keep children safe, it is also their job to
provide opportunities for them to learn what they can and
can&#146;t do safely.</p>
<p>Supervision is still necessary, but this should now include an
increasing amount of opportunity for children to practise making
their own decisions. Complete freedom can be boring as well as
dangerous. Over-restriction will reduce learning opportunities or
push children out of bounds. Protection is still needed, but
education becomes increasingly important to enable children to
take responsibility for their own safety. You can&#146;t always
be with them. Children learn best by copying what they see others
do. Set good examples for your child to follow. Explain why you
are doing things in a particular way and allow practice
opportunities, under your supervision. This will help you to know
when your child can manage safely alone.</p>
<hr>
<h3>To Keep Your Child Safe</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Constantly supervise play in and around water.</li>
    <li>Always supervise play in parks and playgrounds and teach
        your child the safe way to use play equipment.</li>
    <li>Accompany your child when crossing a street and teach
        safe behaviour in traffic.</li>
    <li>Teach your child to use tools and kitchen equipment
        safely.</li>
    <li>Keep matches and cigarette lighters away from your
        child&#146;s reach.</li>
    <li>Talk to your child about &#145;stranger danger&#146;.</li>
    <li>Allow your child only those toys suitable for this age
        group.</li>
    <li>Insist your child remains restrained at all times when in
        a vehicle.</li>
    <li>Make certain your child&#146;s immunisations are
        up-to-date.</li>

<h3><a name="Rubella.">Rubella.</a> Why is Immunisation
Important?</h3>
<p><strong>All women of child-bearing age should be immunised
against rubella.</strong></p>
<p>For adults, rubella, or German measles as it used to be
called, is usually a mild disease with a rash and a fever. But
for a woman who contracts the disease in the early months of
pregnancy, rubella can cause devastating abnormalities in her
unborn baby (fetus). Deafness, blindness, heart defects and
mental retardation may result.</p>
<p>A woman who has been immunised against rubella <strong>before
she becomes pregnant</strong> significantly reduces the risk of
her unborn baby being affected by the disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowContagiousisRubella?">How Contagious is Rubella?</a></h3>
<p>Rubella is <strong>highly contagious</strong> and can be
caught directly from somebody who has the disease, through their
coughs and sneezes, or through contact with the nose or throat
secretions of that infected person. </p>
<p>As the symptoms of rubella usually take about two weeks to
develop, people often do not realise they have the disease.
During this time they may unknowingly spread the disease to an
unprotected woman in the early stages of pregnancy, a time when
the unborn baby is most at risk.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowCanYouProtectYour">How Can You Protect Your
Unborn Child?</a></h3>
<p>The best way to protect expectant mothers and their babies
from rubella is to make sure that all women of child-bearing age
have been immunised against the disease <strong>before</strong>
they become pregnant and to immunise all children and teenagers
to stop the spread of infection.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhoisImmunisedAgainstRubella?">Who is Immunised
Against Rubella?</a></h3>
<p>All children and teenagers are offered protection against
rubella. The rubella vaccine is included in the combination
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) injection, which is recommended
for both boys and girls at 12 months of age and again between the
ages of 11 and 14 years.</p>
<p>A young woman who misses the MMR vaccination, usually given in
school Year 8, should visit her doctor to receive a rubella
vaccination.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatIfYouHaveHadRubella?">What If You Have Had
Rubella?</a></h3>
<p>If a person has been medically diagnosed with rubella, he or
she will usually have lifelong immunity to the disease. However,
as rubella is generally a mild disease, it is often very
difficult to be certain that an individual has had the disease
unless their doctor has taken a blood test to confirm it. As it
will do no harm to be immunised after having had the disease, it
is safer to be immunised, than not, if there is any doubt.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatIfYouArePlanningPregnancy?">What If You Are
Planning Pregnancy?</a></h3>
<p>All women of child-bearing age should have a blood test to
check if they are immune to rubella well before planning
pregnancy and prior to each subsequent pregnancy. This is
especially important if a woman thinks she may have missed out on
the rubella vaccination at school, but recommended regardless as
immunity to the vaccine can diminish with time.</p>
<p>If the test shows no immunity, her doctor can then arrange a
rubella vaccination.</p>
<p>Although no complications in pregnancy have been reported,
women should not receive the vaccine if they are pregnant or
might become pregnant within two months.</p>
<p>If a woman is already pregnant, a vaccination can be arranged
for after the birth of her baby.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RubellaandPregnancy">Rubella and Pregnancy</a></h3>
<p>If a woman comes into contact with rubella when pregnant, she
should discuss the situation with her doctor. The risk of her
fetus being affected will depend on the immunisation status of
the woman and the age of her unborn baby.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="IsThereAnyReason">Is There Any Reason</a> Not To
Immunise Against Rubella?</h3>
<p>A doctor will not immunise against rubella when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a woman is pregnant or likely to become pregnant in the
        next two months</li>
    <li>the person is suffering from an acute infection</li>
    <li>the person has a known allergy to the antibiotic Neomycin</li>
    <li>the person is immuno-suppressed, e.g. receiving oral
        steroids, chemotherapy, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Side-Effects">Side-Effects</a></h3>
<p>There are usually no side effects from rubella vaccine.
However occasionally individuals may experience a mild fever,
rash, sore throat or temporary aches and pains 1-3 weeks after
being immunised. In rare cases, individuals may suffer from a
prolonged high fever and a reaction around the vaccination site.
If this occurs, you should consult your doctor.</p>

<p>Immunisation is the community&#146;s best defence against
epidemics of certain diseases which can cause serious illness and
sometimes death.</p>
<p>The Health Department&#146;s recommended immunisation schedule
provides protection against the following diseases:</p>
<h3><a name="Diphtheria"><font color="#FF0080">Diphtheria</font></a></h3>
<p>Diphtheria is a highly contagious disease caused by bacteria
in the mouth, throat and nose of an infected person. The bacteria
produce a toxin which can damage the heart and nerves.</p>
<p>It is spread by direct contact with an infected person or from
contact with the nose and throat secretions of that person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; a sore throat, fever and the
formation of a grey membrane inside the throat &#150; take about
two to five days to develop. If untreated, a person is usually
infectious for 28 days after the onset of symptoms. </p>
<p>Diphtheria can cause difficulty in breathing, suffocation,
paralysis and heart failure. About one in ten people who contract
diphtheria will die.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Tetanus"><font color="#FF0080">Tetanus</font></a></h3>
<p>Tetanus is an often fatal disease caused when bacteria
(usually found in manure, soil and dust) infect a wound and
produce a dangerous nerve toxin.</p>
<p>It can be contracted from an injury as seemingly insignificant
as a splinter, rose thorn prick or graze. It cannot be passed
from person to person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; muscle stiffness and painful spasms
(first in the neck and jaw muscles, then in the back, chest,
abdomen and limbs) &#150; take about four to 21 days to develop.</p>
<p>Tetanus can cause painful convulsions, breathing difficulties,
an irregular heart beat and death. </p>
<p>Because of immunisation, tetanus is now rare in Australian
children, but it still occurs in adults who have never been
immunised or in those who have not had their tetanus boosters,
due every ten years. </p>

<h3><a name="Pertussis"><font color="#FF0080">Pertussis</font></a><font
color="#FF0080"> (Whooping Cough)</font></h3>
<p>Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly contagious disease
which affects the air passages causing <strong>severe</strong>
coughing spasms and breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>It is spread by direct contact with an infected person or by
contact with the nose and throat secretions of that person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; a runny nose and an irritating cough,
which becomes spasmodic &#150; take about seven to ten days to
develop. If untreated, a person is usually infectious for 21 days
after the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Pertussis can cause complications including ear infection,
pneumonia, convulsions and permanent brain and lung damage. About
one in every 200 children under six months of age who catches
pertussis will die.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><em>IMMUNISATION &#150; DTP
(Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis), or Triple Antigen vaccine (as it
is sometimes called) at 2, 4, 6 and 18 months and 4-5 years
protects against the above diseases during childhood. ADT (Adult
Diphtheria/Tetanus) at 12-15 years and every 10 years thereafter
protects against diphtheria and tetanus during the teenage/adult
years.</em></font></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Measles"><font color="#FF0080">Measles</font></a></h3>
<p>Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which can cause
serious complications. One in 25 children who contract the
disease will develop pneumonia, one in 2000 will develop
inflammation of the brain and one in ten of these children will
die.</p>
<p>It is spread by direct contact with an infected person or from
contact with the nose and throat secretions of that person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; a fever, runny nose, itchy eyes,
cough and rash &#150; take about ten to 14 days to develop. If
untreated, a person is usually infectious from five days before
to five days after the rash appears.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Mumps"><font color="#FF0080">Mumps</font></a></h3>
<p>Mumps is a common, highly contagious viral disease which can
cause serious complications, including inflammation of the spinal
cord and brain, and permanent deafness. </p>
<p>It is spread by direct contact with an infected person or from
contact with the nose and throat secretions of that person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; swelling of the salivary glands, a
high fever and headache &#150; take about 12 to 25 days to
develop. If untreated, a person is usually infectious from six
days before swelling of the glands to nine days after.</p>
<p>About one in five adolescents or adult males who contract
mumps will develop painful inflammation and swelling of the
testicles. Recovery is usually complete, although on rare
occasions infertility may result. </p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Rubella"><font color="#FF0080">Rubella</font></a></h3>
<p>Rubella &#150; also known as German measles &#150; is usually
a mild viral disease, but if a woman contracts the disease in the
early months of pregnancy, it can cause devastating abnormalities
in her unborn baby. Deafness, blindness, brain damage and heart
defects can occur.</p>
<p>It is highly contagious and spread by direct contact with an
infected person or from contact with the nose and throat
secretions of that person. </p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; a slight fever, swollen glands, itchy
eyes, joint pain and a rash &#150; take about 14 to 21 days to
develop. If untreated, a person is usually infectious from seven
days before the appearance of the rash to at least four days
after.</p>
<p>The only way to stop the serious effects of rubella is to make
sure all women are immunised before they become pregnant and to
immunise all children and teenagers.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><em>IMMUNISATION &#150; MMR
(Measles/Mumps/Rubella) vaccine for boys and girls at 12 months
of age, and again between the ages of 11-14 years protects
against these diseases.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><em>A woman should have a blood test to
check her immunity to rubella </em><em><strong>before</strong></em><em>
planning pregnancy </em><em><strong>and prior</strong></em><em>
to each subsequent pregnancy.</em></font></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Hib"><font color="#FF0080">Hib</font></a><font
color="#FF0080"> (Haemophilus influenzae type B)</font></h3>
<p>Hib disease most commonly causes bacterial meningitis (an
infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord)
and epiglottitis (a swelling of the throat that can cause
choking).</p>
<p>It is highly contagious and spread by direct contact with an
infected person or from contact with the nose and throat
secretions of that person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> of meningitis &#150; fever, vomiting,
headache, neck stiffness and drowsiness &#150; and epiglottitis
&#150; fever, sore throat and difficulty in breathing &#150; take
about two to four days to develop. </p>
<p>About one in 20 children who contract Hib meningitis or
epiglottitis will die. One in six children who survive Hib
meningitis will develop complications, including cerebral palsy,
deafness and brain damage.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><em>IMMUNISATION &#150; HibTITER (at 2,
4, 6 and 18 months) or Pedvax Hib (at 2, 4 and 12 months) protect
against Hib disease. </em></font></p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Poliomyelitis"><font color="#FF0080">Poliomyelitis</font></a><font
color="#FF0080"> (Polio)</font></h3>
<p>Polio is a gastrointestinal virus which can cause fever,
vomiting, muscle stiffness and paralysis.</p>
<p>It is spread by direct contact with an infected person.</p>
<p><em>Symptoms</em> &#150; headache, diarrhoea, vomiting and
stiffness in the neck and back &#150; take about three to 21 days
to develop. If untreated a person is usually infectious from a
few days before the onset of symptoms to at least 21 days after. </p>
<p>Although polio is now uncommon in Australia, immunisation is
still very important. Polio is highly contagious, and outbreaks
of the disease still occur in some parts of the world. About one
in 30 people who contract polio will die, and about half of all
patients who survive suffer permanent paralysis.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><em>IMMUNISATION &#150; OPV (Oral Polio)
or Sabin vaccine given as drops by mouth at 2, 4 and 6 months,

Whooping Cough&quot; </font></h1>
<hr>
<p>Whooping cough is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>highly infectious </li>
    <li>dangerous to babies </li>
    <li>most prevalent in the summer months. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whooping cough is becoming more common with hundreds of cases
being reported in Australia every year. </p>
<p>Whooping cough begins with an unremarkable cough and runny
nose. In a week or two it builds up and bouts of coughing
increase in frequency, mainly at night. After a coughing attack,
the child goes red in the face, stops breathing briefly then
makes a crowing noise (the whoop) as air is drawn back into the
lungs. Often the child then vomits before lying back exhausted. </p>
<p>Young babies may not whoop, but still may have difficulty in
getting their breath back. This may make their lips turn blue. </p>
<p>Between coughing bouts, the child appears well, and shows no
distress. After two to four weeks, the coughing starts to ease
but continues for at least six weeks after the illness first
started. </p>
<p>Complications may include: </p>
<ul>
    <li>earache </li>
    <li>pneumonia </li>
    <li>viral infections </li>
    <li>brain damage. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whooping cough is not usually associated with wheezing, but
brings on wheezing in asthmatic children. This makes diagnosis
difficult. </p>
<p>The recommended prevention is injections of triple antigen
(DTP) at two, four, six and eighteen months and five years of
age. This vaccine immunises against diphtheria and tetanus as
well. </p>
<p>Pain and tenderness at the injection site is common. The child
may run a temperature during the first 24 hours after the
immunisation. Paracetamol should be given just before DTP
vaccination (15mg/kg/dose) and four hours later to reduce the
likelihood of fever.</p>
<p>Serious reactions are rare and a doctor may occasionally
decide against further whooping cough immunisations. However, the
risks of immunisation with triple antigen are considerably less
than the risks which go with catching diphtheria, tetanus or
whooping cough. </p>
<p>Triple antigen injections should be put off if the baby has a
high temperature on the day immunisation is due. Routine illness
such as a cold is not a reason to delay immunisation.</p>
<p>Immunisation protects about 80 per cent of babies against
whooping cough. Some children do get the disease in spite of
receiving the full course of injections. Even so, for them the
infection is considerably milder and with fewer complications
than for children who have had no immunisation. </p>

<h3><a name="ToiletTraining">Toilet Training</a></h3>
<p>Parents really look forward to their child becoming toilet
trained, and their eagerness is as much for their own sakes as
for the child&#146;s.</p>
<p>But bowel and urine control cannot be hurried. It is just
wishful thinking to set a target date for the big day when the
nappies can be put away.</p>
<p>Too much pressure too early is likely to delay rather than
hasten the achievement.</p>
<p>A child will not be ready to do the right thing in the right
place until he or she is mature enough to understand the idea and
cooperate with it. The timing varies from child to child, even in
the same family. It is rarely achieved under 18 months, but
usually occurs between two and three years of age.</p>
<p>Children do not necessarily achieve bladder and bowel control
at the same time. Some will gain bowel control first and others
urine control first.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GettingReady">Getting Ready</a></h3>
<p>One of the first promising signs is when the child shows by
word, noise or gesture that he or she is wet or soiled. It means
the beginning of linking the sensation with the result.</p>
<p>A promotion from nappies to pants is encouraging at this stage
and shows the child that the increasing maturity is noticed.
Going back to nappies may be seen by the child as a &#145;vote of
no confidence&#146; though nappies are still likely to be needed
at night time and for daytime sleeps.</p>
<p>Clothes should be easy for the child to slip off. Often the
child&#146;s second summer is seen as an ideal time to start. A
child&#146;s urge to &#145;go&#146; is immediate and at first he
or she can&#146;t hold on to get to the toilet. This control
takes time to develop. Accidents should not be considered as
naughtiness.</p>
<p>It is a matter of choice whether to use a potty, a potty chair
or a child&#146;s seat that fits the adult toilet. It is a good
idea to get the child familiar with all of them. Comfort and
security are important, so firm foot support such as steps or a
box is needed, to stop worries about falling off or falling in.</p>
<p>Wait until the child is off the toilet and the lid is down
before flushing. Some children are frightened by the rush of
water, and some like to press the button themselves.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GettingStarted">Getting Started</a></h3>
<p>In the beginning the child has to be able to identify the
feeling of wanting to &#145;go&#146;. He or she should be able to
let the mother or father know when the feeling comes. Later the
child will be able to &#145;hold on&#146; until getting to the
potty. It is hard not to be disappointed about accidents, but
parents&#146; pleasure in the effort, not just the successes,
helps the child keep trying to get it right.</p>
<p>If the child usually has a bowel motion at the same time each
day, it seems sensible to sit him or her on the potty at that
time. One way to get started is to take the child to the toilet
or potty about every hour and after each meal. The child is kept
on the potty for only a few minutes and praised whether there is
a result or not. Later, children will develop their own pattern
and either tell you or take themselves.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GettingThere">Getting There</a></h3>
<p>Newly-achieved control can be broken by sickness, a family
upset or other stress that makes the child retreat to earlier
patterns. There is no point in getting cross. The set-back
won&#146;t last long once the upset has been resolved.</p>
<p>Dry days do not automatically mean dry nights. Night-time
control does not usually occur until between three and four
years. Many quite big children who never have mishaps during the
day wet their beds at night. Reassurance that he or she will
become dry will boost a child&#146;s self-esteem.</p>
<p>If you are worried about it, check with your child health
nurse or doctor that there is no physical cause. Usually time
will fix the situation, so enjoy the days and let the nights take
care of themselves.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Remember...</h3>
<p><strong>Toilet training will happen when</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>children know they want to &#145;go&#146;</li>
    <li>they can tell you they want to &#145;go&#146;</li>
    <li>they can wait until they get to the toilet.</li>

<h3><a name="WhyisMMR">Why MMR Immunisation?</a></h3>
<p>Measles, mumps and rubella (sometimes called German measles)
are serious diseases which continue to harm many West Australian
children and adults each year.</p>
<p>To help protect against these diseases, it is recommended that
both boys and girls receive two measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
immunisations &#151; the first at 12 months of age and the second
between the ages of 11 and 14 years.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhyBoysandGirls?">Why Boys and Girls?</a></h3>
<p>In the past, boys and girls received an MMR immunisation at 12
months of age, while only girls received a rubella immunisation
during their teenage years. In 1993, to help control the number
of outbreaks of measles, mumps and rubella, a second MMR
immunisation was introduced for both teenage boys and girls.</p>
<p>The greater the number of people immunised, the less likely it
is for diseases like measles, mumps and rubella to spread from
person to person.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatisMeasles?">What is Measles?</a></h3>
<p>Measles is a highly contagious disease with serious
complications. One in 25 children who contract the disease will
develop pneumonia; one in 2000 will develop inflammation of the
brain and one in ten of these children will die.</p>
<p>Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, itchy eyes and a
cough. Three to four days after these symptoms appear, a rash
develops on the face, and then over the entire body.</p>
<p>The symptoms of measles usually take ten to 14 days to develop
and a person is usually infectious from five days before, to five
days after the rash appears.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatisMumps?">What is Mumps?</a></h3>
<p>Mumps is a common, highly infectious disease which causes
swelling of the salivary glands, fever and headache. The disease
can cause serious complications, including inflammation of the
spinal cord and brain, and permanent deafness. </p>
<p>About one in five adolescents or adult males who contract
mumps will develop painful inflammation and swelling of the
testicles. Although recovery is usually complete, on rare
occasions infertility may result. </p>
<p>The symptoms of mumps usually take 12 to 25 days to develop
and a person is usually infectious from six days before swelling
of the glands, to nine days after.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatisRubella?">What is Rubella?</a></h3>
<p>Rubella (or German measles) is usually a mild disease, but if
a woman contracts the disease in the early months of pregnancy,
rubella can cause devastating abnormalities in her unborn baby.
Deafness, blindness, brain damage and heart defects can occur. </p>
<p>It is especially important that all women be protected against
rubella before they become pregnant.</p>
<p>The symptoms of rubella &#151; a slight fever, swollen glands,
itchy eyes, joint pain and a rash &#151; take about 14 to 21 days
to develop and a person is usually infectious from seven days
before the appearance of the rash to four days after.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowareMeasles">How are Measles</a>, Mumps and
Rubella Spread?</h3>
<p>Measles, mumps and rubella are all highly contagious diseases.
They can be caught directly from somebody who has the illness,
from their coughs and sneezes, or through contact with the nose
and throat secretions of that person. </p>
<p>As the symptoms of measles, mumps and rubella take many days
to develop, children and adults may unknowingly spread the
infection to others within the community. Immunisation is the
only effective way of stopping the spread of these serious
diseases.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhenShouldYouBeImmunised?">When Should You Be
Immunised?</a></h3>
<p>The combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is recommended
for <strong>boys and girls</strong> at 12 months of age and again
between the ages of 11 to 14 years.</p>
<p><strong>All women of child-bearing age should be immunised
against rubella. </strong></p>
<p>A woman should have a blood test to check her immunity to
rubella, before planning pregnancy and prior to each subsequent
pregnancy. If the test shows no immunity, her doctor can arrange
a rubella immunisation. If she is already pregnant, she should
avoid all possible contact with the disease and receive an
immunisation after the birth of her baby. </p>
<p>A woman <strong>should not</strong> receive a rubella or MMR
vaccine if she is pregnant or likely to become pregnant within
two months.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhereisImmunisationAvailable?">Where is Immunisation
Available?</a></h3>
<p>In the metropolitan area FREE MMR immunisation for babies and
teenagers (in school Year 8) is available from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the Health Department&#146;s Central Immunisation Clinic
        at 16 Rheola Street, West Perth</li>
    <li>most local councils (check with your council&#146;s
        environmental health officer)</li>
    <li>your doctor (a fee may be charged for the consultation). </li>
</ul>
<p>In the country FREE MMR immunisation for babies and teenagers
(in school Year 8) is available from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your health service immunisation clinic</li>
    <li>your doctor (a fee may be charged for the consultation). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>School Immunisation</strong></p>
<p>The Health Department of Western Australia visits schools
throughout the State, usually in Year 7 or 8 (or earlier in some
areas) offering FREE MMR immunisation to teenage girls and boys.
Teenagers missing their MMR immunisation in Year 8 should visit
their doctor to receive this immunisation. </p>
<p>As with all Health Department immunisations, a single use
sterile syringe and a separate dose of MMR vaccine is used for
each person.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RecordingImmunisations">Recording Immunisations</a></h3>
<p>It is very important that an individual&#146;s Immunisation
Record Card be presented when attending for an immunisation.
Record Cards are important documents and should be kept up to
date, and in a safe place at all times.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhenShouldMMRImmunisationbeDelayed">When Should MMR
Immunisation be Delayed or Avoided?</a></h3>
<p>MMR immunisation should be delayed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>if a child/teenager is very unwell or has a high fever</li>
    <li>if a woman is pregnant, thinks she might be pregnant, or
        is planning pregnancy within the next two months.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no reason to delay MMR immunisation if taking
antibiotics when recovering from an illness.</p>
<p>MMR immunisation should be avoided:</p>
<ul>
    <li>when there is a known allergy to Neomycin</li>
    <li>within three months of receiving immunoglobulin or a
        blood transfusion</li>
    <li>if the person is immuno-suppressed or has a disease that
        affects the immune system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children with severe egg allergies can safely receive MMR
immunisation under close medical supervision.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether MMR immunisation should be delayed
or avoided, check with your doctor, community nurse or the
Central Immunisation Clinic on (09) 321 1312.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Side-EffectsandRisks">Side-Effects and Risks of MMR
Immunisation</a></h3>
<p>Most commonly a child or teenager may feel unwell and develop
a fever and rash approximately six to 11 days after an MMR
immunisation. Itchy eyes, a runny nose, head cold, cough, neck
and joint pain (particularly among teenagers) and swelling of the
neck glands (usually about three weeks after the immunisation)
may also develop. These side-effects, which are not infectious,
usually last 2 to 3 days and can be reduced by giving the
recommended dose of paracetamol. </p>
<p>More serious reactions to MMR immunisation are rare.
Inflammation of the brain has been reported in less than 1 per
million administered doses.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about any symptoms following an
immunisation, contact your doctor, community health nurse, local
hospital or the Central Immunisation Clinic.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="MMRsomeanswers">MMR &#151; Some Answers</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Any pregnant woman who comes into contact with rubella
        should discuss the situation with her doctor.<br>
    </li>
    <li>It is perfectly safe for a child, whose mother is
        pregnant, to receive any recommended routine
        immunisation, including MMR immunisation.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Although very rare, a person can still get measles, mumps
        or rubella after they have had an MMR injection. But,
        their illness is usually much less severe than in those
        who have never been immunised. </li>
</ul>
<p>MMR immunisation can be safely given on the same day as any
other immunisation, but it must be administered at a different
site on the body.</p>

<p>Touching and caressing are among the ways people express their
affection. There is no doubt that touching and stroking a baby
regularly does much to help the bond between the parent and
child. It also helps the child to feel more secure and happy. A
good example of this is seen in special nurseries for premature
babies, where parents are now encouraged to spend time touching
and stroking their tiny babies. The experience seems to help
parents cope better with their infants and the babies benefit as
well.</p>
<p>In the past few years, much has been written about baby
massage, and some doctors, physiotherapists and nurses are
teaching the art. Massage has been used for centuries in other
parts of the world for relaxation and well-being. Now, Australian
parents are becoming interested in discovering how it can benefit
their babies.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="What">What</a> is Baby Massage?</h3>
<p>Baby massage is really just light, gentle stroking done in a
rhythmical way. We do this almost instinctively to any small
creature, particularly when it is restless, uncomfortable or
frightened.</p>
<p>Babies are touched a lot just in the normal course of being
cared for - every time they are picked up, have their nappies
changed or are rocked to sleep. Massage is a part of this - it
adds a little bit of extra stroking which brings pleasure and
relaxation to you both.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="TheBenefits">The Benefits</a></h3>
<p>All babies benefit from massage but some need it more than
others.</p>
<p>Tense or irritable babies who cry a lot and may suffer from
colic can be encouraged to relax with gently, warm stroking.
Babies born prematurely or with a disability, or who have been
ill, also learn that massage is a warm, pleasurable exchange
between themselves and their parents.</p>
<p>Massage can help a baby to become aware of its own body. He or
she will often gaze fixedly at an arm or leg while it is being
massaged. Stroking a part which has been sore or painful -
perhaps after surgery - can help a baby forget the painful
procedure and teach that after all, touch is pleasurable.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="When">When to Begin</a></h3>
<p>Baby massage can begin as early as you wish. When your baby is
very new, use soft and gentle strokes.</p>
<p>As he or she grows stronger, so can your touch. Do not be
afraid to stroke firmly. You will find the baby enjoys being
handled and massaged in a way that communicates both your love
and your confidence.</p>
<h3><a name="How">How Long?</a></h3>
<p>A tiny baby may only tolerate 5 - 10 minutes of massage, while
an older one may enjoy 20 - 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Choose a time when you and your baby are both happy and
relaxed. It is important for you to be calm and unstressed. Try
to ignore the telephone - turn the bell as low as possible. Take
a few deep breaths to help you relax before you start massaging.
Some relaxing background music helps, too.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowitisDone">How it is Done</a></h3>
<p>Technique is not important. Try to &#145;tune in&#146; to your
baby and let your hands find their own strokes.</p>
<p>All massage movements are done from the centre outwards, i.e.
from shoulder to hand, thigh to foot.</p>
<p>What you do on one side of the body, repeat on the other. If
you begin on your baby&#146;s front, turn him or her owner when
you have finished and massage the back.</p>
<p>Begin anywhere on your baby - the head and face are often good
places to start. Watch as you stroke and learn which parts of the
body he or she most enjoys you touching. All babies have their
preferences.</p>
<p>Talk to your baby as you massage, and enjoy the baby&#146;s
responses.</p>
<p>Here are a few strokes you may like to try:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Long, firm strokes, down arms, legs, chest, abdomen and
        back, much the same as you would stroke a cat.</li>
    <li>Gentle but firm kneading of hands and feet with your
        thumbs. Kneading is a stronger movement than stroking and
        is done in little circles with thumbs or fingers. It
        moves the muscles beneath the skin.</li>
    <li>Circular finger-kneading down the back on the neck and on
        to the shoulders, on the fleshy muscles of the chest, and
        along the back muscles.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AsBabyGrows">As Baby Grows</a></h3>
<p>If your baby becomes restless, stop and try again another day.
Babies sometimes need a few massages before learning to relax and
enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>An older baby can be massaged sitting on your lap. Once they
can roll over, babies are often not happy to lie still long
enough to be massaged.</p>
<p>Modify your touching as the baby grows. Legs can be stroked at
story time and the baby rubbed with soap in the bath. There may
be times - such as when learning to walk - when a baby will
refuse to be massaged at all, but don&#146;t be concerned. Once
the baby has mastered the new achievement, he or she will enjoy
massage again.</p>
<p>Further information on baby massage is available from your
nearest Nursing Mothers&#146; Association representative - check
in the telephone directory. Baby massage demonstrations can be
arranged by ringing the physiotherapist at the State Child
Development Centre. The telephone number is (09) 481 2203.</p>
<p>Books available on baby massage include: &#147;Baby
Massage&#148; by Amelia Auckett (Hill of Content, 1981), and
&#147;Infant Massage&#148; by Vimala Schneider (Bantam, 1982).</p>

<hr>
<p>Your baby&#146;s teeth begin to form during the fifth week of
pregnancy. At birth, all 20 crowns are well formed.</p>
<p>The teeth will appear when baby is aged between six months and
two and a half years. There is wide variation; some children may
get their first teeth at four months, others at 11 months. Girls
are usually earlier than boys.</p>
<p>There is no disadvantage to baby in late teething and the
process cannot be accelerated.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Teething">Teething</a></h3>
<p>Teething is the process of new teeth breaking through gums.
Flushed cheeks, swollen and tender gums, finger-sucking and
dribbling are common symptoms. Teething can make some children
irritable and restless. Rubbing baby&#146;s gums with your finger
or a small spoon, or giving a teething ring or a rusk to chew may
help the gum tissue to open. If pain persists, obtain a teething
gel from your pharmacist.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Caring">Caring for Baby's Teeth</a></h3>
<p>Proper care of first teeth is important - they are needed for
eating, speaking, smiling, and to maintain the space for the
permanent teeth to develop underneath.</p>
<p>Plaque (a sticky invisible film made of bacteria and leftover
food debris) forms in your child&#146;s mouth, just as it does in
your own.</p>
<p>Toothbrushing should start as soon as the first teeth appear.
Choose a toothbrush with a small head and soft bristles. Brushing
is easier if you are behind the child. It may help to sit the
toddler on your lap, with their head resting against your body.
This will give you better control over the process and your
toddler will feel more secure. Brush along the chewing surfaces
of the teeth, then in circular motion on the outside surfaces,
being sure to brush the gums. On the inside surfaces, do gentle
flicks from the gum to the biting edge.</p>
<p>Children like to imitate others. They will probably want to
brush their own teeth like the rest of the family. At this stage
establishing a regular brushing habit is more important than a
precise technique. Encourage children to care for their own
teeth. However, parents should supervise or assist children with
toothbrushing until they are about eight years old. Children do
not have the skill to use a toothbrush correctly before this age.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Fluoride">Fluoride</a></h3>
<p>For most people, fluoride toothpaste is best, but many infants
and small toddlers swallow the toothpaste. It is best to use a
low-fluoride toothpaste for these children until they are able to
spit out. The quantity of toothpaste used should be a
&#145;smear&#146; for infants and a pea-sized amount for
toddlers.</p>
<h3><a name="Diet">Diet</a></h3>
<p>Unhealthy food choices can lead to early dental decay. The
greatest danger is sugar. Children who frequently consume sugary
foods or drinks increase their risk of development dental decay.
Never add sugar to foods and drinks, and choose those with low
sugar levels.</p>
<p>Encourage children to drink water, especially between meals.
Avoid prolonged contact between teeth and food and drinks with a
high sugar content. This is more likely to occur when a babies
are given a bottle of milk or juice, or a sweetened dummy, to put
them to sleep. Sugar and a build-up of harmful bacteria on the
teeth lead ultimately to decay. Replace breast feeding with
gradual weaning to a cup from around 6 to 12 months of age.</p>
<p>Avoid using sweets and lollies as a reward; it conditions
children to regard sweet things as &#145;good&#146; foods when
they are not. Parents&#146; attention is the best reward for
children.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Accidents">Accidents</a></h3>
<p>As many as 3 in 10 children have accidents involving their
baby teeth. Fortunately, such traumas rarely affect the permanent
ones. If an accident injures teeth, take the child to a Dental
Therapy Centre or a dentist&#146;s surgery as soon as possible.</p>
<h3><a name="IrregularTeeth">Irregular Teeth</a></h3>
<p>Small children from four to six years seldom need orthodontic
treatment to correct irregular teeth. However, your dentist or
the school Dental Therapy Centre will be able to tell you whether
treatment is necessary.</p>
<p>One frequent cause of irregular teeth is prolonged
thumb-sucking. It can interfere with normal tooth and facial bone
development. If your child needs a dummy, try a NUK dummy,
designed to resemble the natural contours of the breast nipple
during nursing and help the infant&#146;s mouth to develop
normally. It is best to discourage daytime thumb and dummy
sucking after the age of two. However, breaking sucking habits
abruptly could cause undue stress. If thumb sucking persists when
a child reaches school age, it may be necessary to seek help.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Community">Community Dental Services</a></h3>
<p>Western Australia has a well-developed School Dental Service,
with many centres in school grounds. It caters for all enrolled
preschool children and school children up to Year 11. In some
areas care is offered for younger and/or older children. The
service seeks to prevent dental disease by giving health
education and preventive care, but treatment will be given where
needed. The child may be referred to a specialist if the
treatment needed is complicated. You can obtain information from
any Dental Therapy Centre.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Remember...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Teething times vary widely.</li>
    <li>Tooth cleaning should start at six months or earlier.</li>
    <li>Use a low-fluoride toothpaste for children under six
        years of age.</li>
    <li>Avoid giving sugary foods or drinks to your baby,
        particularly at sleep times. Do not let baby go to sleep
        with a bottle.</li>
    <li>Take your child to a dentist or Dental Therapy Centre if
        any baby tooth is injured.</li>

<p>Sight is precious, so eye care is important.</p>
<p>Protect children&#146;s eyes by seeking prompt treatment for
injuries and infections, and having proper medical checks as soon
as anything appears to be wrong. Even small eye problems need
prompt, regular attention to avoid unnecessary sight loss.</p>
<p>A small child whose vision is poor does not realise that it is
possible to see better, and will not complain. So it is up to
parents to make sure their children&#146;s eyesight is as good as
it can be - and stays that way.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Injuries">Injuries</a></h3>
<p>Vision can be permanently impaired by anything that pierces,
burns, splits or hits the eyeball. We know a lot more than we
used to about repairing eye damage, but not all injuries can be
mended.</p>
<p>Common causes of eye injuries include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sharp-pointed objects such as sticks, stones, pencils,
        pointed instruments, sharp toys and fish hooks which may
        penetrate the eye or scratch the cornea (front of the
        eye).</li>
    <li>Objects that may fragment and send a splinter or shard
        into the eye.</li>
    <li>Animals and birds that may scratch, bite or peck. Make
        sure children do not tease pet dogs or cats, or get in
        their way at feeding time. Children need to take special
        care during magpies&#146; nesting times, between August
        and October.</li>
    <li>Burns caused by:<br>
        - heat (e.g. cigarette ends, sparks, scalds, explosions);<br>
        - corrosives (e.g. chemicals, fuels, lime, toxic plants);<br>
        - intense light (e.g. looking directly at the sun during
        an eclipse).</li>
    <li>Blows to the closed eye, with a ball or fist. Even a
        cricket bat or hockey stick hitting the upper part of the
        face can cause eye damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>With older children, one of the main causes of severe eye
injury is &#145;throwing things&#146; - gumnuts, sand-bombs or
keys on a ring.<br>
In a younger child, even a minor eye injury - a sore eye for
three or four days - can cause loss of vision called amblyopia,
or lazy eye, which happens because the eye &#145;switches
off&#146;.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Eye Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Supervise children and teach them sound safety rules when
playing. See that these rules are applied. It helps to be aware
of situations in which accidents are likely to occur. Try to
remember accidents and near-misses of your own childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment of Eye Injuries</strong></p>
<p>Seek immediate medical attention whenever an eye is, or could
have been, injured. If possible, cover the eye lightly with a
sterile dressing (a clean handkerchief will do), and go straight
to a doctor or emergency service. Do not try to remove a foreign
body stuck in the eyeball.</p>
<p>Burns are the exception: If the eye is burnt by any chemical -
powders such as lime, or liquids such as detergent and some plant
saps - administer immediate first aid. Flood the eye with cool
running water for about 15 minutes. If you do not have access to
a tap, pour cool water into the eye from a container. Do this
first, THEN get medical help.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Infections">Infections</a></h3>
<p>Bacteria or viruses can infect the eyes or tissues around
them, causing pain, redness, discharge and &#145;bung&#146; eyes.
Any infection should be treated promptly by a doctor, and
instructions followed carefully. Some infections can result in
permanent scarring and loss of eyesight.</p>
<p><strong>Herpes</strong> (cold sore) often gets into
children&#146;s eyes if they are kissed by somebody with a cold
sore. A herpes ulcer in an eye may cause permanent scarring and
loss of eyesight. When you have a cold sore on your face do not
kiss your child.</p>
<p><strong>Trachoma</strong> infects the eye surface and linings
of the eyelids. It may eventually cause sight loss if it is not
treated early. Good hygiene helps to stop this infection from
spreading.</p>
<p><strong>Acute conjunctivitis</strong> causes bloodshot eyes
and sometimes a discharge of pus.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention of Eye Infections</strong></p>
<p>Eye infections spread easily from person to person, but they
can, to a large extent, be prevented by clean habits that stop
the spread of germs. Keep towels and face cloths separate, see
that hands are washed after playing with pets, going to the
toilet or playing outside.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="OtherEyeProblems">Other Eye Problems</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>squint</strong> (strabismus) and a <strong>lazy eye</strong>
(amblyopia) are not conditions a child &#145;will grow out
of&#146;.</p>
<p>If physical problems prevent a child&#146;s eyes from working
together as a pair, either or both eyes will try to &#145;go it
alone&#146;. The child develops the habit of looking first with
one eye, then with the other. The stronger eye is always used for
seeing and the other one virtually &#145;switches off&#146;,
sometimes leading to loss of sight in that eye. This poor vision
is called lazy eye or amblyopia. Sometimes a squint (turned eye)
is obvious from an early age, but often it is slight and is not
noticed until vision is tested at the child health clinic or by
the school health nurse.</p>
<p>If a child&#146;s eye turns in or out, moves more slowly than
the other or seems to have trouble focusing, have the condition
checked as soon as possible. It is never too early to have your
baby&#146;s eyes examined, even when only a few months old. The
earlier treatment is started, the better the results. By school
age, it may be too late for a perfect correction.</p>
<p><strong>Short sight, long sight</strong> and <strong>astigmatism</strong>
are caused by imperfections in the size or the shape of the eyes.
A child is never too young to test for these problems, which are
often accompanied by &#145;lazy eye&#146;, requiring urgent
medical treatment. Glasses may be prescribed to help the child
see properly, and a patch may be worn over one eye.</p>
<p>Children&#146;s eyes change as they grow, so frequent medical
examinations are necessary to maintain good eyesight.</p>
<p>It is very important to have eye problems identified early,
and corrected. If children can go to school with eyes that see as
well as possible, they are spared a great deal of frustration and
unhappiness in the classroom and in the playground.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Remember...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Get prompt medical attention for eye injuries, infections
        and vision problems.</li>
    <li>Supervise little children. Keep them away from hazardous
        situations which may result in eye injury.</li>
    <li>Teach older children the importance of looking after
        their eyes. Repeat and reinforce safety messages
        constantly.</li>
    <li>Set a good example, e.g. wear approved safety goggles in
        the home workshop. Keep toddler away from work areas.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>There&#146;s a warm, comfortable bed waiting for you.
You&#146;re tired. The minute you&#146;ve folded that last nappy
...</p>
<p>Then the baby wakes. Or won&#146;t go to sleep in the first
place. Or disturbs you in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Most babies are non-conformists. They see no need for the
sleeping time-tables that keep life comfortable for parents.</p>
<p>Broken nights leave parents tired, cross and worried &#151; is
the baby missing sleep he or she really needs? And if the baby
isn&#146;t &#151; they are.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Everybaby&#146;sdifferent">Every baby&#146;s
different</a></h3>
<p>Babies, like everybody else, are all different. Some need more
sleep than others. When they are very tiny, they sleep when they
need to and wake when they&#146;ve slept enough. So a very
wakeful baby might simply need less sleep than that elder brother
or sister who slept all night and most of the day.</p>
<p>Having a pain, or feeling uncomfortable or cold, might keep a
baby from sleeping. Once he or she is warm and comfortable, sleep
soon follows.</p>
<p>But some comfortable, well-fed babies need a lot less sleep
than parents think is &#145;right&#146;. If they are otherwise
well and contented, there is no need to worry. Plan your own
resting times to coincide with their sleep.</p>
<h3><a name="DaytimeSleep">Daytime Sleep</a></h3>
<p>Babies should be allowed to sleep when they are tired. The
number of naps during the day will not affect their night time
sleep provided a routine is in place.</p>
<p>Simply making a child sleepy does not always make them sleep
better. When children are overtired they can be stressed and may
become irritable and overactive.</p>
<h3><a name="Growingolder">Growing older</a></h3>
<p>As babies grow older, they begin to be more disturbed by
external things like the lights going on or off, telephones
ringing or people creeping in to &#145;have a look&#146;. They
might resist bedtime because they are frightened of being alone
and want to be reassured that Mum or Dad is still there.</p>
<p>From about nine months old, or sometimes younger, some babies
seem able to keep themselves awake when they want to, even when
they are very tired. Keeping to a regular bedtime routine and
avoiding late-in-the-day excitements helps sleep to come at the
end of a natural winding-down period.</p>
<p>You get to know your own child. If he or she is uncomfortable
or distressed then comfort is needed. It&#146;s a different type
of crying from the complaint of somebody who wants to be picked
up and entertained.</p>
<p>One suggestion is, go to them if they cry &#151; but once you
are sure they are warm and comfortable, don&#146;t pick them up.
If they keep crying or calling you back, it might be enough to
call out to let them know you are still there.</p>
<p>It is usually best if their bedroom is near enough for them to
hear normal household noises going on, so they know they are not
quite alone.</p>
<h3><a name="Smooththeway">Smooth the way</a></h3>
<p>Nobody can sleep while excited or tense. Try to have a bedtime
routine which makes the change from being awake with you, to
being asleep without you, a gradual one.</p>
<p>All sorts of non-people comforts can help make the bedtime
break easier &#151; cuddling things like old blankets or soft
(and safe) toys. These things can be very important. They
can&#146;t get up and walk away like people. The child controls
them, they don&#146;t control him or her. Most grow out of
needing them in their own good time.</p>
<h3>Ritual</h3>
<p>Small children often cling to bedtime rituals - everything
happening in the same place, in the same order, every night.</p>
<p>Provided they don&#146;t become too elaborate, these rituals
are quite useful. Sleep becomes part of a natural progression
&#151; brush teeth, kiss toys good night, take off right shoe,
take off left shoe ...</p>
<p>But if you have one of these routines, make sure you explain
it to anybody else who is baby-sitting for the night.</p>
<h3><a name="Sleeppatterns">Sleep patterns</a></h3>
<p>Babies and children have different sleeping patterns from
adults. Children spend more time in &#145;light&#146; rather than
&#145;deep&#146; sleep and change frequently from one depth of
sleep to another during the night. They tend to surface towards
wakefulness each time their sleep changes and might snuffle,
wriggle around a bit and make wakeful-type noises before settling
down again.</p>
<p>This doesn&#146;t mean they are awake or waking. There&#146;s
no need to go to them unless they actually cry out.</p>
<h3><a name="Norules">No rules</a></h3>
<p>There are no rules for providing families with long, unbroken
nights.</p>
<p>There are so many different babies and children and so many
different reasons for not sleeping that nobody can make rules to
suit everybody.</p>
<p>On the whole, children respond to loving but firm, no-nonsense
handling.</p>
<p>If you have tried all the above suggestions and are still
having troubled, disturbed nights, then seek help. Parents can
feel very desperate when sleep problems continue night after
night, and should not have to feel alone. Discuss the matter with
your community health nurse or family doctor. They may have
helpful suggestions, or be able to refer you to appropriate help.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="Learning">Learning To Talk</a></h3>
<p>Talking is one of the most important skills we have to learn.
It is a complicated process which starts when we are babies.</p>
<p>Parents can do a lot to help their children learn to talk. The
way you touch, talk, listen and react to your baby will lay the
foundation for learning to talk.</p>
<h3>How Babies Communicate</h3>
<p>Babies start to communicate from the time they are born. They
communicate hunger, irritability or happiness by crying, smiling
and cooing. They tell us what they are interested in by looking
or reaching.</p>
<p>As you respond to these messages baby is encouraged to keep
communicating. This is an essential first step towards learning
to talk.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatParents">What Parents Can Do</a></h3>
<p>By watching for your baby&#146;s signals through body language
and sounds you will learn how your baby communicates.</p>
<p>Allow baby to let you know his or her interests. Let baby see
your face. Be on the same level. Baby can get important
information by closely watching your face. Let baby know you are
listening. Imitating your baby is a good way of doing this. Do
what your baby does in noise or action.</p>
<p>WHEN YOUR BABY SMILES AND COOS AT YOU, SMILE AND MAKE NOISES
BACK.</p>
<h3>Use Daily Routines to Encourage Words</h3>
<p>Daily routines are a wonderful time to allow baby to hear the
same words matched to the same events each day. Nappy changing,
feeding, dressing and bath time are great times to build up their
vocabulary. Talk in short, simple sentences.</p>
<p><strong>ALWAYS RESPOND TO BABY&#146;S ATTEMPTS AT TALKING,
EVEN IF YOU DON&#146;T UNDERSTAND THE WORDS.</strong></p>
<p>Interpreting your baby&#146;s attempts may mean guessing at
what he or she is trying to say. Your interest will reward
baby&#146;s effort and give encouragement to keep trying.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SomeMore">Some More Suggestions</a></h3>
<p>Play turn-taking games. &#145;Pat a cake&#146; and
&#145;peek-a-boo&#146; are fun games for babies. They also
introduce them to the rules of give and take that we use in adult
conversation.</p>
<h3>Songs and Rhymes</h3>
<p>Songs and rhymes can be used to encourage communication. Sing
your favourite children&#146;s songs. Music, rhythm and rhyme can
be a happy sharing time for you and your baby and help develop
communication.</p>
<h3>Read Books With Your Baby</h3>
<p>Books are great for babies. From six months on, babies begin
to enjoy books. Choose books that have bright photographic type
pictures, with one picture per page for baby&#146;s first book.
Books with familiar objects are a good beginning. Babies also
love pictures of other babies.</p>
<p>Sturdy, non-tear brooks are available. Books with flaps to
lift or different textures to feel help hold a toddler&#146;s
attention. Use simple repetitive language which relates to the
pictures.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Feeding">Feeding</a></h3>
<p>The lip, tongue and cheek muscles used in sucking, chewing and
swallowing are the same muscles which are later used in speech.</p>
<p>If your baby has difficulties with feeding, seek advice.</p>
<p>Problems may occur with the change from milk to solid foods.
Some babies are very sensitive to foods of different textures and
therefore need to start different tastes as early as six to seven
months of age.</p>
<p>If baby cannot tolerate any variety in food over several
months, seek advice.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Timetable">Timetable For Talking</a></h3>
<p>All children develop at their own rate, so some children will
be slower than others. Many factors influence when first words
are used.</p>
<p>If more than one language is spoken in your home, baby may be
a little slower to talk. This is normal. As a general rule most
children are talking by two years of age.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="IfYouAreWorried">If You Are Worried</a></h3>
<p>If you feel your child</p>
<ul>
    <li>is slow to start speaking</li>
    <li>seems behind other children of the same age</li>
    <li>doesn&#146;t seem to understand</li>
    <li>is having feeding problems</li>
</ul>
<p>seek advice as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The earlier your child receives help, the better. You can seek
advice for a child of any age.</p>
<h3>Where To Get Help</h3>
<p>Ask your community or child health nurse or family doctor to
get in touch with a speech pathologist at Princess Margaret
Hospital, the State Child Development Centre in Rheola Street,
West Perth or at one of the Regional Community Health Department
Centres.</p>
<p>They are there to help you.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ChoosingNappies">Choosing Nappies</a></h3>
<p>Modern parents have the choice of several different nappy
types for their babies. Some prefer the traditional cloth
nappies; others choose a nappy wash service (at least for the
first few months when use is greatest); while others buy the
&#145;disposable&#146; single-use products.</p>
<p>A combination of cloth nappies most of the time, but
disposables on holiday or times when laundry is difficult, may
suit many.</p>
<p>While disposable nappies seem very easy and convenient, they
are expensive and, despite their name, a problem for the
environment. It is illegal to place faecal matter in rubbish
collection containers, and disposable nappies in the toilet will
clog the system. These nappies contain large amounts of wood pulp
and their plastic covers can take many years to break down.</p>
<p>Faecal matter in disposable nappies should be scraped into the
toilet and the nappy wrapped before disposal.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ClothNappies">Cloth Nappies</a></h3>
<p>Two or three dozen cloth nappies (terry-towelling, flannelette
or other material) would easily be sufficient, depending on how
often they were to be washed. Four to six sets of pilchers or
pants to cover the nappies will also be needed, plus nappy pins.</p>
<p>After use, wet nappies should be left to soak in a covered
nappy bucket containing 2-3 tablespoons of bicarbonate of soda
until ready for washing in hot water with pure soap. Soiled
nappies should be scraped and emptied into the toilet, then
rinsed before soaking. Use a dash of vinegar in the final rinse
to neutralise soap.</p>
<p>Some parents use products such as Napisan to sterilise and
whiten nappies, but this should be an alternative to soap, not an
addition, or nappy rash could result.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="NappyRash">Nappy Rash</a></h3>
<p>Nappy rash is a skin condition common in babies and confined
to the nappy area. It is seldom serious and with simple treatment
is usually quick to heal. The extent and appearance of the rash
varies enormously from one child to another. Even the best
cared-for babies may get it at some time, such as when teething.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Causes">Causes of Nappy Rash</a></h3>
<p>Nappy rash is usually caused by a combination of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chemical and other irritants</li>
    <li>Sensitive skin.</li>
    <li>Thrush.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Irritants</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Ammonia formed from baby&#146;s urine by the action of
        bacteria in the stools. (You will notice a strong ammonia
        smell in the nappy and on the baby&#146;s skin.)</li>
    <li>When baby is left in wet or soiled nappies for long
        periods.</li>
    <li>Harsh soaps or detergents used for washing nappies, or
        inefficient rinsing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sensitive Skin</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Babies with eczema (dry, scaly and sensitive skin) or
        cradle cap often get nappy rash.</li>
    <li>Too much soap or harsh soaps at bath time will wash away
        the natural oils which protect your baby&#146;s skin.</li>
    <li>Plastic pants over cloth nappies, or disposable nappies
        left on for long periods, will make the skin hot and
        moist. These conditions encourage the growth of bacteria
        and the development of skin infections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thrush</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Thrush is a yeast-like fungal infection often associated
        with nappy rash. It may come through the bowel to the
        nappy area.</li>
    <li>It usually starts in the mouth, looking like patches of
        milk stuck to the tongue, the insides of the cheeks and
        the roof of the mouth.</li>
    <li>The rash is usually intensely red, has a raised edge and
        red spots away from the main area of infection.</li>
    <li>It does not respond to normal nappy rash treatment, and
        advice should be sought from your Child Health nurse or
        doctor.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Prevention">Prevention</a></h3>
<p>Prevention of nappy rash is better - and often easier - than
the cure.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Keep baby&#146;s nappy area as clean and dry as possible.
        This may mean lots of nappy changes.</li>
    <li>Avoid plastic pants except when absolutely necessary.
        Pilchers made from synthetic or woollen fabric may be
        more suitable.</li>
    <li>Keep to a minimum any cleansing lotions, wipes and nappy
        treatments, that may be in contact with baby&#146;s kin.</li>
    <li>Wash nappies carefully and rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Whenever possible, dry nappies outside in the sun and
        wind to whiten, soften and disinfect. Try hanging nappies
        out at night to prevent stiffness.</li>
    <li>Use a pure, mild soap when bathing your baby.</li>
    <li>Leave the nappy off at selected times during the day.</li>
    <li>Discuss with your Child Health nurse the use of suitable
        re-usable nappy liners. Some may cause skin irritation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p><strong>If your baby has nappy rash:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Change nappies as soon as you notice the need.</li>
    <li>Leave the nappy off whenever possible, allowing the
        irritated skin to dry and heal.</li>
    <li>Avoid plastic pants and disposable nappies.</li>
    <li>At each change, gently wash the entire nappy area with
        plain water and pat dry with tissues or a soft towel.</li>
    <li>Use protective creams and ointments until the skin is
        healed.</li>
    <li>Use a mild soap sparingly at bath time.</li>
    <li>Check nappy washing procedures.</li>
    <li>Seek help for thrush promptly. Your doctor can prescribe
        treatment to clear the bowel or thrush and help stop
        reinfection.</li>
    <li>Consult your doctor if nappy rash is severe or prolonged.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Remember</h3>
<p>Nappy rash can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Being left for long periods in wet or soiled nappies.</li>
    <li>Wearing plastic pants or disposable nappies for long
        periods.</li>
    <li>Nappy lotions, baby wipes or soaps.</li>
    <li>Harsh soaps or detergents used for washing nappies or
        inefficient rinsing.</li>
    <li>Always wash nappies in hot water with a mild soap, such
        as Velvet or Lux flakes, and rinse them well with a dash
        of vinegar. Dry them outside in the fresh air whenever
        possible. If the rash is getting worse in spite of these
        measures, consult your doctor or Child Health nurse.</li>

<h3><a name="SwallowedPoison">Swallowed Poison</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>If possible, quickly identify the poison. If the
        substance is acid (e.g. battery acid, spirits of salts)
        or alkaline (e.g. caustic soda, bleach, ammonia, oven or
        drain cleaner, strong detergent) give a small amount of
        milk or water immediately, in slow sips. Then proceed as
        below.</li>
    <li>Pick up the container and residue (if any) and take to

<h3><a name="TooMuchCan">Too Much Can Be Poisonous</a></h3>
<p>Too much of anything eaten, drunk or absorbed is poisonous.
This includes even the essentials of life as well as products
around your home.</p>
<p>Illness or death can occur if things are over-consumed, either
intentionally or by accident; the difference between life and
death is quantity.</p>
<p>Children learn by experimenting. They don&#146;t know the
dangers, so many are poisoned sampling such things as moth balls,
kerosene, garden plants and aspirin.</p>
<p>Make one household cupboard your medicine chest. It should be
out of the reach of small children, and should be locked or
fitted with a child-resistant catch.</p>
<p>Discard old medicines. Separate medicines applied externally
and those taken by mouth. At night, or if there is insufficient
light to read labels, turn on a light before giving medicine to a
child - or before taking it yourself. Always make doubly sure you
are giving - or taking - the correct dose. If you use reading
glasses, remember to put them on before checking labels.</p>
<p>The words &#145;Caution&#146;, &#145;Danger&#146; and
&#145;Warning&#146; on labels mean that you should read - and
then <strong>re-read</strong> - the instructions before measuring
out a dose.</p>
<p>Label instructions for household products such as &#145;Use
with adequate ventilation&#146; or &#145;Avoid prolonged or
repeated breathing of vapours&#146; mean more than just opening a
window. The air <strong>must</strong> be circulating continually
- use a strong fan or air extraction system, unless there is a
good, natural breeze.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RulesToPrevent">Rules To Prevent Poisoning</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Store and handle household products and medicines safely.
        Store them in a locked or child-resistant cupboard out of
        reach of children. When using them, <strong>never</strong>
        leave them within reach of children or unattended.</li>
    <li>Keep everything in original containers, <strong>never</strong>
        in cups or soft drink bottles.</li>
    <li>Be sure that all products are properly labelled, and read
        the label before using.</li>
    <li>Keep drug and medicine cupboards secure and tidy.</li>
    <li>Clean out your medicine cabinet regularly. Return
        unwanted and out-of-date medicines to a pharmacy.</li>
    <li>Since children tend to imitate adults, avoid taking
        medicines in their presence.</li>
    <li>Refer to medicines by their proper names. They are not
        lollies.</li>
    <li>Do not mix vitamins, drugs and other tablets in the same
        container.</li>
    <li>Do not give anyone another person&#146;s prescription
        medicine.</li>
    <li>Ask for household substances and medicines in
        child-resistant packaging.</li>
    <li>Check that pharmacy labels include full details: name of
        medicine, how much to be taken, and how often.</li>
    <li>Tins and bottles that have held liquid medications or
        household products should be rinsed with water before
        being thrown out.</li>
    <li>Keep indoor and outdoor plants away from small children.
        They may be toxic or may have been treated with poisonous
        sprays.</li>
    <li>Teach older children to leave plants, berries, flowers
        and seeds alone, and do not let them eat unwashed fruit
        and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands after handling plants, before touching
        food.</li>

<hr>
<p>When you are new to the world, spend most of your life in a
bassinet or pram, and want to attract attention, there is only
one thing to do - cry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for parents, discovering exactly why a baby is
crying is not quite so straightforward.</p>
<p>&#145;Getting the message&#146; can be particularly difficult
in the early days, when parents and baby are still getting to
know each other, and nobody is sure which cry means what. Helpful
advice often just leaves you feeling you must be doing something
wrong.</p>
<p>Some babies cry more than others. However, all babies cry
sometimes and, if the reason for crying is not obvious, parents
may feel anxious and distressed - more distressed perhaps than
the baby.</p>
<p>Anxiety can be catching, and babies who sense that parents are
worried and tense will become even more distressed. So try to
stay calm, and relax before handling your baby. Deep breathing
and other relaxation techniques learnt in prenatal classes can be
useful.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Feeding">Feeding</a></h3>
<p>Feeding and sucking are both important needs for baby. Breast
milk is digested rapidly so a breastfed infant may wake and cry
to be fed every two or three hours.</p>
<p>If breast milk flows too quickly, the baby may have trouble
coping with the flow and be hard to settle.</p>
<p>Try taking the baby off the breast often, to bring up wind. In
the meantime, absorb excess milk with a towel. Some mothers find
that feeding &#145;uphill&#146; (on their back with the baby on
their stomach) works for them, but remember to sit up before the
end of the feed to avoid blocked milk ducts.</p>
<p>If your baby is bottle fed, make sure the hole in the teat
allows a steady flow of milk. When the bottle is held upside
down, milk should drip out at a rate of one drop per second.</p>
<p>The average sucking time for a feed is about 20 minutes. A
baby with a very strong need to suck may not be satisfied with
this. A dummy may be the answer - but be sure to keep it
sterilised and do not dip it into honey or anything sugary or
your own saliva.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="SettlingDown">Settling Down After Feeds</a></h3>
<p>Most babies are relaxed and ready for sleep after a feed. If
wind appears to be a problem, try light tummy massage or a gentle
cycling leg motion.</p>
<p>A deep warm bath is relaxing and may help to settle baby.</p>
<p>Lower baby into bed slowly, head held in the palm of your hand
to avoid the feeling of falling backwards into space and ensuring
good head support. Leave baby&#146;s hands free and, instead of a
pillow, use a folded towel under the top end of the mattress.</p>
<p>Some babies grizzle softly to themselves as they go to sleep.
It is best not to disturb them.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="FeelingSecure">Feeling Secure</a></h3>
<p>Babies need to feel secure. Being close to another person is
the most secure feeling of all. Often babies cry less if they are
carried in a baby sling. Most new babies like to be wrapped
firmly in a light shawl.</p>
<p>Carrying a newborn or picking up a baby who is very distressed
is not spoiling. As babies grow, all sorts of familiar sights and
sounds help them to feel secure. The rhythmic motion of a rocking
chair, pram or cradle or the vibrations of a washing machine or
dishwasher may be soothing.</p>
<p>Babies sometimes feel comforted if their pram or bassinet is
placed where they can hear normal household noises, or - when
they are older - sit up and see what is happening.</p>
<p>If baby is staying with a baby-sitter, leave something that
you would normally wear. The baby will recognise your familiar
smell and feel safer.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="GrizzlingTime">Grizzling Time</a></h3>
<p>Babies are likely to have a particular time of day when they
are restless and unsettled for no particular reason. Often this
is in the late afternoon or evening. Try to plan your day so you
are not too busy at this time.</p>
<p>If the weather is suitable, it is a good idea to put baby in a
pram and go for a walk. The motion usually helps to settle baby.</p>
<p>Gentle patting, stroking or rocking are also soothing. Or you
might talk or sing quietly for a while, or play soft music to
help the baby to drift off.</p>
<h3><a name="Crying">Crying At Night</a></h3>
<p>Babies change from one depth of sleep to another more
frequently than adults. They might snuffle and make wakeful-type
noises when their sleep changes - but this doesn&#146;t mean they
are awake or waking. There is no need to go to them unless they
really start to cry.</p>
<p>A hungry baby will cry for food day or night. But if the baby
won&#146;t settle after feeding, maybe the need is for comfort
more than food. A baby who wakes at night may feel alone and
strange. It&#146;s best not to let the baby become distressed.
Knowing that you are there when wanted helps the baby to feel
secure, and develops a sense of trust. As a consequence, the baby
is less likely to feel anxious and cry during the night.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="TooHot?">Too Hot? Too Cold?</a></h3>
<p>Babies will grizzle and fuss if they are too hot or too cold -
and crying makes a hot baby hotter. Babies feel heat and cold
more than adults do. On a hot day, a cool bath can do wonders. An
extra breastfeed or, if the baby is bottle fed, a drink of cool,
unsweetened, boiled water may also help.</p>
<p>On a cold day, make sure baby has enough clothing, including
bootees and hat, when outdoors.</p>
<h3><a name="NeedsChanging?">Needs Changing?</a></h3>
<p>A wet nappy doesn&#146;t usually bother a baby, unless it
becomes cold and uncomfortable. But if nappies are not changed
often enough, skin may become inflamed and sore. When changing,
gently wipe the skin dry. If it looks sore, bathe it with clean
water and pat it dry with a towel. It is not necessary to use
talcum powder.</p>
<p>Avoid using plastic pants unless you need to as they can get
steamy and hot inside and make the baby&#146;s bottom sore.
Instead, use fabric pilchers made of synthetics or wool.</p>
<p>Gradually, you will become more confident and sensitive to
your baby&#146;s needs. In the meantime, don&#146;t let yourself
get run down. Rest whenever the baby does - your health is more
important than housework.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Remember...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All babies cry - it is their only way of communicating.</li>
    <li>Be calm when you handle baby - anxiety is catching.</li>
    <li>When baby cries, check for wind or a wet nappy. Find out
        whether baby is hungry, hot or cold.</li>
    <li>Often the need is for comfort: baby may need to suck or
        to be held. Familiar sights, sounds and smells are
        soothing.</li>
    <li>Organise housework so less important jobs can be left
        undone if baby if fretting.</li>
    <li>Look after your own health.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>For many years, a father&#146;s role was restricted to that of
provider, protector and planner. The &#145;head of the
family&#146; was seen as a figure of authority and was rather
remote.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this tradition image is changing. Today, many
mothers work outside the home and both parents are responsible
for earning the family income. Consequently, more and more
fathers now share the tasks formerly seen as woman&#146;s work -
shopping, cooking, housework and child care.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="BeforeBirth">Before Birth</a></h3>
<p>Childbirth now also tends to be a shared experience. Many
fathers-to-be take an interest in antenatal issues, accompany
their partners to parenthood classes and help them with
preparations for the birth. Many are there when the baby is born,
and can support the mother during delivery.</p>
<p>Shared parenting from a baby&#146;s earliest days is a
positive step for everyone. It helps the bonding between father
and child. However, not all men can be, or want to be, present at
their baby&#146;s birth. Some may feel uncomfortable in a
delivery room - and some women prefer to do this job on their
own. Seeing your child being born does not, in itself, make you a
better father.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="AfterBaby">After Baby is Born</a></h3>
<p>A patient, loving father can be very important for mother and
baby, especially in the first few weeks after birth.</p>
<p>A first-time mother may need time to adjust to her new role,
both emotionally and physically. The moral support her partner
can give her, as well as help with the heavier household tasks,
can make a difference to how quickly she recovers and settles
into motherhood.</p>
<h3><a name="Relationships">Relationships</a></h3>
<p>Psychologists believe that if fathers and children get to know
each other from the start they develop a close bond of belonging
which can help them sort out later conflicts.</p>
<p>Many men are natural nurturers, with an enormous capacity for
loving and caring. There is no reason why a man cannot bath,
change, cuddle and comfort the child. A growing number of couples
have chosen to share these early duties equally - each working
part-time for instance - while others have exchanged traditional
roles.</p>
<p>Babies cannot have too much loving. It&#146;s the cuddling,
rocking and stroking from the minute they are born that helps to
build their self-esteem, their sense of trust and their knowledge
that they are valuable individuals. It also influences how they
approach the world in general.</p>
<p>Feeling loved by all members of the family gives children an
understanding of who they are and that they are important and
wanted.</p>
<p>Above all, they need to know that they are equally important
to both parents.</p>
<p>Ideally, having both parents as role models helps children
become responsible and caring young adults. They learn from the
way parents are together and the love and attention they share
between them and give their children. These behaviour patterns
are taken into the children's own adult relationships.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Discipline">Discipline</a></h3>
<p>Giving children a lot of loving does not mean letting them
take control. Guidelines for acceptable behaviour are still
required and will be more effective if agreed on by both parents.
They also help children feel safe and secure.</p>
<p>It is important to maintain consistency in discipline. Both
mother and father must follow the same guidelines or the child
will soon learn to play one parent against the other. Discipline
is not punishment but training that develops self-control through
understanding, guidance and examples.</p>
<p>When faced with anger, children cannot understand that they
are still loved. They are used to experiencing simple emotions
one at a time - mixed feelings are too difficult for them to
grasp. How you can love and punish at once?</p>
<p>When your child has done something wrong - maybe something
which has caused considerable damage - it is normal for you to
feel angry. However, children cannot fully understand why you are
so upset and they are bewildered and confused by this sudden
outburst. So it is a good idea, once you have simmered down, to
cuddle your child and show that it is the behaviour, not the
child, which is unacceptable.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ANewBrother">A New Brother or Sister</a></h3>
<p>Fathers can play a particularly valuable role in helping a
toddler adjust to the birth of a new brother or sister. A child
who has a good relationship with Dad does not feel so deprived
when Mum leaves to have the second baby. However, having to share
her when she returns can be upsetting, and most children will be
understandably jealous of the new arrival. It is important that
father spends time with the older child, easing him or her
through the changes a new brother or sister will bring.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhenFather">When Father is Missing</a></h3>
<p>For one reason or another, many children nowadays grow up
without a father. Most of them cope well, but it is important
that their everyday contacts should not be only with women. Both
girls and boys need a father figure to lend balance to their
world. A grandfather, an uncle or a close family friend can be a
real-life father model and give further attention.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Remember...</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Shared parenting is good for father, mother and child.</li>
    <li>Girls and boys need a father equally.</li>
    <li>A male role model is important for children growing up
        without a father.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="What">What</a> is hepatitis B?</h3>
<p>Hepatitis B is a viral infection which affects the liver. It
may or may not cause acute disease. The majority of adults who
are infected do not suffer a serious illness and do not develop
jaundice. If an obvious illness does develop, the severity varies
from mild to severe. Ten to 15 per cent of adults who are
infected become long-term carries of the disease. The risk of
becoming a carrier is highest in those who are infected at birth
from their infected mother. Long-term carriers face a risk of
liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howis">How is hepatitis B</a> transmitted?</h3>
<p>Hepatitis B is treatment by blood-to-blood contact and by
sexual intercourse. The main risks from blood-to-blood contact
are through puncture wounds from needles which carry infected
blood. Hepatitis B is also transmitted from infected mothers to
their babies at birth. This method of transmission is the most
serious because many infected babies become lifetime carriers of
the disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Whois">Who is at risk</a>?</h3>
<p>Most Australians are not at significant risk of hepatitis B
infection but some groups in the community are at higher risk of
infection. These groups are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Certain ethnic groups, South and East Asian migrants, and
        Aboriginal people.</li>
    <li>Occupations in which blood-to-blood exposure may occur
        &#150; nurses, doctors, dentists, pathology laboratory
        technicians.</li>
    <li>Those who practise high-risk behaviours &#150; injecting
        drug users and homosexual men.</li>
</ul>
<p>Individuals at high risk (because of their occupations or
behaviour) should be immunised against hepatitis B. In addition,
the babies of mothers at high risk should be immunised as soon as
possible after birth.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="WhatifI">What if I am exposed to hepatitis B</a>?</h3>
<p>Australians who are not at risk may be exposed to hepatitis B
at some time in their lives through an injury, such as a puncture
wound with an infected needle. In such cases, prompt treatment
can prevent hepatitis B infection. The best treatment is a
combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B
vaccine.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowdoI">How do I avoid becoming infected</a>?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Don&#146;t ever share needles and syringes or any other
        injecting equipment.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Protect yourself from transmission through sex.<br>
        - Use condoms for anal, vaginal and oral sex.<br>
        - Be aware that the risk increases with the number of sex
        partners.<br>
        - Be aware that the risk is particularly high for those
        who have anal sex.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Don&#146;t share personal items such as razors and
        toothbrushes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Should">Should emergency workers</a> and first aid
volunteers be immunised against hepatitis B?</h3>
<p>Health departments in Australia do not recommend that
emergency workers and first aid volunteers be immunised against
hepatitis B except in rare circumstances where they work in a
remote location with a high risk of blood-to-blood exposure.</p>
<p>The best defence against hepatitis B is intact skin. Standard
hygiene procedures, including the routine covering of any cuts or
abrasions, will be adequate to protect against infection. Should
an accident happen where blood-to-blood exposure definitely
occurs, special treatment can be commenced to reduce the risk of
any hepatitis B infection.</p>
<p>Blood testing studies in Australia and New Zealand have shown
that groups such as police and sewerage workers are at no more
risk of infection than office workers. Studies of different
occupational groups are continuing and any indication of special
risk to a particular group will quickly be publicised by health
authorities.</p>
<p>Media publicity has encouraged a variety of occupational
groups to undertake immunisation. These include teachers, surf
lifesavers and first aid officers. Health departments in
Australia consider that such recommendations are not supported by
evidence of a significantly increased risk of infection. The only
groups for whom immunisation is recommended are those high-risk
groups listed above.</p>

<h3><a name="What">What</a> is hepatitis?</h3>
<p>Hepatitis is a general term used to describe inflammation of
the liver. It may be caused by alcohol use, some chemicals and
drugs, and viral infections such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and
G.</p>
<p>These viruses may produce similar symptoms, but are
transmitted differently. The ways they are prevented and treated
also differ. Therefore, they are regarded as different diseases.</p>
<p>This pamphlet contains information about hepatitis C only.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howdangerous">How dangerous is hepatitis C</a>?</h3>
<p>More than 70% of people who have been infected with the
hepatitis C virus may continue to carry the virus in their blood
and become chronic carriers. It is believed than at least 20% of
chronic carriers will develop scarring of the liver, known as
cirrhosis. This may take 20 years or more to develop, and some
people with cirrhosis may also go on to develop liver cancer.</p>
<p>It is though that carriers of hepatitis C probably remain
infectious throughout their lives. This means they may be able to
transmit the disease to others at any time.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Whatarethe">What are the symptoms</a> of hepatitis
C?</h3>
<p>In many cases, people may not become ill when they are first
infected with the hepatitis C virus. Others may experience a
minor &#145;flu-like&#146; illness. However, in some cases
people&#146;s urine may become dark and the whites of their eyes
and their skin may turn yellow (jaundice). Hepatitis symptoms may
disappear within a few weeks but this does not necessarily mean
that the infection has also disappeared. A person with hepatitis
symptoms should see their doctor.</p>
<p>When liver inflammation lasts for longer than six months, the
illness is called long-term or chronic hepatitis. Symptoms of
chronic hepatitis C include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>mild to severe tiredness</li>
    <li>loss of appetite</li>
    <li>feeling unwell and vomiting</li>
    <li>soreness in the upper right part of the abdomen (under
        the ribs)</li>
    <li>fever</li>
    <li>pain in the joints.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howis">How is hepatitis C</a> transmitted?</h3>
<p>Hepatitis C is a blood-borne disease. That means transmission
occurs via blood-to-blood contact. Transmission of the virus most
frequently occurs when infected blood enters another
person&#146;s bloodstream either directly through broken skin, or
mucous membrane.</p>
<p>In Australia, the majority of people have become infected with
the hepatitis C virus through the sharing of needles and other
equipment used for injecting drugs. Some people have been
infected after sharing needles and other equipment only once.</p>
<p>There are other ways that people risk being infected with
hepatitis C. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Receiving a needlestick injury from a &#145;sharp&#146;
        or needle contaminated with blood containing the
        hepatitis C virus.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Engaging in skin piercing activities or any activity that
        may cause bleeding, including tattooing, when the sharp
        instrument is contaminated with blood containing the
        hepatitis C virus.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Having unprotected sex involving trauma and/or bleeding,
        e.g. anal sex, or penetrative sex with a woman who is
        infected with hepatitis C and is menstruating. There is
        thought to be a low risk of infection through
        penile-vaginal sexual intercourse at times other than
        menstruation.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Sharing personal items which can break the skin and they
        may have traces of blood on them, such as razors,
        toothbrushes and dental floss.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is as low risk that an infected mother may pass on the
hepatitis C virus to her child either during pregnancy, or at
birth. The risk of hepatitis C transmission through breast milk
is considered to be very low.</p>
<p>In Australia, the risk of receiving blood transfusions, blood
products or body tissue/organs infected with hepatitis C is low,
since all donations have been screened for the hepatitis C virus
since 1990.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C cannot be passed on by everyday social contact,
such as shaking hands, kissing, sharing bathroom or toilet
facilities, or by donating blood.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowdoI">How do I avoid</a> becoming infected?</h3>
<p>There is no vaccine available to stop a person becoming
infected with hepatitis C. However, there are ways to reduce the
risk of hepatitis C infection:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For people who inject drugs, never share needles,
        syringes, filters, water or spoons, and wash hands or
        swab fingers before touching another person&#146;s
        injection site. Always use clean needles and syringes,
        available from most chemists, needle and syringe exchange
        outlets, and some country hospitals.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Use safer sex practices, including using condoms during
        sexual intercourse and oral sex.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Use properly sterilised needles only once for any
        skin-piercing procedure.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid sharing personal items, such as razors and
        toothbrushes.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Health care workers should always use infection control
        procedures in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Isthereatest">Is there a test</a> for hepatitis C?</h3>
<p>A blood test is available to show if a person has been
infected with hepatitis C. It may take four to six months from
the time of infection before the test can detect evidence of
infection. This test can only show that you have been infected at
some time in the past, but it cannot determine if an infected
person has become a carrier.</p>
<p>Specialised laboratories can undertake a test which may help
to establish if the virus is still present in a person&#146;s
blood or liver. This test is not routinely performed and is
expensive.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Ifyoualreadyhave">If you already have hepatitis C</a></h3>
<p>Treatment with antiviral medicines has been used to decrease
inflammation in the liver. There are some major side-effects and
the results of Australian and overseas studies suggest that about
one in five people may have benefited in the long term. You
should talk to your doctor about treatment options.</p>
<p>Your doctor can help you manage your condition. Balancing your
diet, avoiding alcohol, and getting plenty of rest will help keep
you fit and healthy. It is also important to take precautions to
minimise the spread of infection to others. Being infected with
hepatitis C does not prevent you from becoming reinfected with
the same or a different strain of the virus.</p>
<p>There is a booklet providing information for people who
already have hepatitis C, available from the Health Department of
Western Australia.</p>

<h3>HIV/AIDS</h3>
<p>HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection is an illness
which affects the body&#146;s immune system, so that it is unable
to fight infections and cancers. Someone infected with HIV
remains infected and infectious for life. AIDS (Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a later stage of HIV infection. Not
all patients necessarily progress through to this stage.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howyoucan">How you can get it</a></h3>
<p>HIV is transmitted in three ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>through unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex with an
        infected person</li>
    <li>through contact with infected blood or blood products</li>
    <li>from an infected woman to her child, in the womb, during
        birth or from breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Unsafebehaviours">Unsafe behaviours</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The greatest risk for both males and females is from
        unprotected anal sex.</li>
    <li>Unprotected vaginal sex is also a risk for males and
        females.</li>
    <li>Sharing injecting equipment, particularly needles and
        syringes, can introduce HIV directly into the
        bloodstream. Sexual partners of people who share
        injecting equipment are also at risk.</li>
    <li>Unprotected oral sex is a possible risk, particularly if
        there are cuts or sores in or around the mouth or genital
        area.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howyoucan't">How you can&#146;t get it</a></h3>
<p>HIV is spread in only a few ways. Social contact such as
shaking hands, drinking from the same glass, hugging and kissing
an infected person is safe. Although HIV has been found in all
body fluids, there is no evidence that saliva, tears or sweat are
infectious.</p>
<p>Normal workplace and educational situations do not put people
at risk from transmission of HIV. However, where work or
educational practices include contact with blood and body fluids,
special precautions are required.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Symptoms">Symptoms</a></h3>
<p>People with HIV can appear healthy and may show no symptoms
for 10 years or more. People may be infected without knowing it
and transmit HIV to others during this time.</p>
<p>As the virus continues to attack the immune system, a person
will develop signs and symptoms of the disease. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>persistent fatigue</li>
    <li>swollen lymph glands</li>
    <li>rapid weight loss</li>
    <li>night sweats</li>
    <li>memory loss</li>
    <li>persistent diarrhoea.</li>
</ul>
<p>These symptoms can continue over a period of time. When the
immune system is severely damaged, certain cancers, infections
and brain disorders can occur. This stage of the illness is
called AIDS.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Diagnosis">Diagnosis</a></h3>
<p>A blood test will show whether a person has come into contact
with HIV. This test, which identifies the antibodies to HIV,
usually gives a negative result for the first one to three months
after initial infection. This is called the window period.
Therefore, it is recommended that if a person has a negative test
result, but has been at risk of recent infection, the test should
be repeated in three to four months&#146; time.</p>
<p>When a test is undertaken, counselling is given before and
after. This is to ensure that the person having the test fully
understands the implications of either a positive or negative
result. The doctor will arrange to give the test results
face-to-face, and all information regarding the test remains
confidential.</p>
<p>If the test is positive, the law in Western Australia requires
that the doctor notify the Commissioner of Health. If the person
has no symptoms, then this is done using a code and not the
person&#146;s name. However, if the person is diagnosed as having
AIDS, their name and address is notified. This information is
maintained in the strictest confidence by the Health Department
of Western Australia.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p>Currently there is no cure for HIV. However, there is a lot
that can be done to manage the illness. This includes medical
treatments and lifestyle choices which assist people with HIV to
live healthy lives for many years.Therefore, early diagnosis is
very important. People with HIV will be referred to specialist
services which provide medical, social, emotional and other forms
of support. For further information on these services see the
contact list at the end of this pamphlet.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Protecting">Protecting yourself and your partner</a></h3>
<p><strong>Always use safer sex practices.</strong></p>
<p>Safer sex means avoiding sexual contact where the semen, blood
or vaginal fluids of one person pass directly into the body of
another person. There are alternatives to penetrative sex, and
ways to have sexual enjoyment without putting yourself and your
partner at risk. People can enjoy each other sexually by hugging,
kissing, massage and mutual masturbation.</p>
<p><strong>Use condoms during sexual intercourse and oral sex.</strong></p>
<p>Condoms used with a water-based lubricant help prevent sexual
fluids passing from one person to another.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#146;t share injecting equipment.</strong></p>
<p>Needles and syringes, spoons, filters, water and glasses may
have traces of blood in them.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#146;t share personal toiletry items.</strong></p>
<p>Toothbrushes, dental floss and razors may have traces of blood
on them.</p>
<p><strong>Always use disposable or properly sterilised needles
for skin and body piercing or tattooing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Avoid having many sex partners.</strong></p>
<p>The fewer people you have sex with, the less likely you are to
come into contact with someone who has HIV or any other STD. The
safest sexual choice is to have sex with only one uninfected
person who also has no other sexual partner and who doesn&#146;t
share injecting equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Drug and alcohol use.</strong></p>
<p>Alcohol and other drugs impair judgement and can affect
decisions about sexual behaviour. Try to avoid having sex while
under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Whatisfoodpoisoning"><em>What is food
poisoning</em></a><em>?</em></h3>
<p>Food poisoning is any illness caused by eating food.
Allergies, heavy metals, viruses and chemicals can all cause food
poisoning. However, the main cause of food poisoning is bacteria.</p>
<p>Not all bacteria are harmful: some are used to make foods such
as cheese, yoghurt and beer. Bacteria capable of causing serious
illness grow best at body temperature (37&#176;C) but can grow at
temperatures between 5&#176;C and 60&#176;C. This temperature
range is known as the <strong>&#145;temperature danger zone&#146;</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Symptoms"><em>Symptoms of food
poisoning</em></a></h3>
<p>The symptoms of food poisoning depend on the bacteria causing
the illness. Some or all of the following symptoms are associated
with food poisoning:</p>

<p>Vomiting and diarrhoea can lead to dehydration and possibly
death. Dehydration is especially dangerous for infants and the
elderly.</p>
<p>Pregnant women need to be particularly careful when choosing
and preparing food as Listeria infection can result in
miscarriage and stillbirth. (For more information see <a
href="ehs19.htm">Listeria Infection and Pregnancy</a> leaflet.)</p>
<p>The time between eating contaminated food and the start of
symptoms is called the onset time and varies depending on the
bacteria causing the disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Toprotect"><em>To protect your food</em></a></h3>
<p>Bacteria cannot move on their own &#150; they must be carried
from one place to another. Bacteria are spread by poor food
handling practices or by contact with pets, flies or other pests.

<h3><a name="Whatis">What is hepatitis A?</a></h3>
<p>Hepatitis A (also known as &#145;infectious hepatitis&#146;),
is a viral infection of the liver. It usually causes a very mild
illness in young children but can cause a more serious illness in
older people. Death from hepatitis A is rare.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Whatare">What are the symptoms of hepatitis A?</a></h3>
<p>The infection starts between two and seven weeks (on average
about four weeks) after exposure to the virus. The first symptoms
are like a flu or other viral infection: feeling generally unwell
with aches and pains around the body and sometimes a low fever.
You often don&#146;t want to eat and smokers don&#146;t want to
smoke anymore.</p>
<p>A few days later there may be pain on the right side of the
abdomen. Vomiting may occur and is often brought on by the smell
or sight of food.</p>
<p>Most adults and some children who catch hepatitis A then
develop jaundice. This means that the whites of the eyes turn
yellow and the urine becomes dark orange or brown. The skin may
turn yellow too.</p>
<p>The illness usually lasts for a week or two, leaving people
feeling tired and washed out for another week or two.
Occasionally, in more severe cases, it may take longer to get
completely well again.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howis">How is hepatitis A transmitted?</a></h3>
<p>Hepatitis A is an infectious disease. It is spread by
contaminated water and food, by fluids, and from person to person
by way of unwashed hands.</p>
<p>Those who are most at risk are household contacts, and
children and staff at day care centres where there has been a
case of hepatitis.</p>
<p>The presence of hepatitis A in a day care centre does not
necessarily mean that the centre is dirty. Young children have
very close contact with each other when they are playing and it
is easy for the hepatitis A virus to be passed from child to
child.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="HowdoI">How do I avoid becoming infected?</a></h3>
<p>To prevent hepatitis A, wash your hands with soap and water
after going to the toilet, before eating and particularly before
preparing food.</p>
<p>Hepatitis A virus is quickly killed by boiling water and
common disinfectants, like household bleach. Clothes and bed
linen can be decontaminated in an ordinary washing machine on hot
water cycle. Eating utensils will be decontaminated by normal
washing up.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been looking after a person with hepatitis A
should wash their hands immediately afterwards.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Howdoyou">How do you know if you have hepatitis A?</a></h3>
<p>If you or your child develops some or all of the symptoms
described above, see your doctor, who can do a blood test to
check for the hepatitis A virus.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Isthereany">Is there any treatment for hepatitis A?</a></h3>
<p>Antibiotics do not work against hepatitis. Some medicines
actually put extra strain on the liver.</p>
<p>The sick person should rest and drink plenty of fluids.</p>
<p>People who came in contact with a person with hepatitis can
get good protection against catching it by having an injection of
immunoglobulin from the doctor. They must have this injection
within two weeks of contact with the disease.</p>
<p>Even if you are unlucky and catch hepatitis after an injection
of immunoglobulin, you will probably have only a very mild, brief
illness.</p>
<p>If you have had hepatitis, do not drink alcohol for several
months afterwards. If your doctor wants to put you on medication,
always mention that you have had hepatitis A in the past.</p>
<p>A vaccine is available for protection against hepatitis A, but
it is recommended only for travellers going to countries where
hepatitis A is common and for staff of day care centres and
sewerage workers. Three doses of the vaccine are required: the
first two are given at two to four week intervals, and a third 12
months after the initial dose.</p>
<p><strong>For further information: Consult your doctor.</strong></p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Listeria_Infection"><em>Listeria
Infection and Pregnancy</em></a></h3>
<p>Listeria infection (listeriosis) is an illness caused by
eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria
monocytogenes. Those most at risk are the immuno-compromised
(e.g. on radiation therapy, chemotherapy, kidney dialysis etc)
and pregnant women. Pregnant women are a high risk group because
Listeria infection can be transmitted to the foetus and may cause
miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth or a very ill newborn
baby. </p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Symptoms"><em>Symptoms</em></a></h3>
<p>In some people Listeria infection may cause minor illness with
a mild fever, headache, aches and pains. Sometimes there may be
severe illness with a high temperature. Diagnosis is difficult
because it is similar to many other acute infections. </p>
<p>Healthy adults (including pregnant women) may not show any
symptoms. </p>
<p>The incubation period for listeriosis is not known accurately
but may range from two to 90 days. </p>
<p>If you are pregnant, have eaten high risk foods and develop a
flu like illness with a fever, you should see your doctor as soon
as possible. Pregnant women who are suspected of having
listeriosis may have to be treated with antibiotics.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="How_to_avoid"><em>How to avoid
Listeria infection?</em></a></h3>
<p>Listeria can be found on the surface of raw unwashed
vegetables and in certain processed foods including soft cheeses,
pat&eacute; and some meat products. </p>
<p>The best protection against Listeria infection is to practise
good food handling and avoid eating high risk foods.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="What">What</a> is Bacterial Vaginosis?</h3>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition in women. It is
caused by an imbalance or overgrowth of normal bacteria that live
in the vagina. Sometimes the condition is called
&#145;Gardnerella&#146;. It is not serious, and may only require
treatment if symptoms cause distress or inconvenience.</p>
<p>Research is still being done, but it seems bacterial vaginosis
is not sexually transmissible. Usually the sexual partner of a
woman being treated for bacterial vaginosis needs no treatment.
Women who are not sexually active, or never have been, can have
bacterial vaginosis.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Symptoms">Symptoms</a></h3>
<p>Some women may have the condition but have no symptoms at all.
If so, there is no need for treatment as the condition generally
causes no harm. In pregnancy bacterial vaginosis may lead to
early labour, and so treatment may be given in these cases.</p>
<p>Usually, women seek treatment for bacterial vaginosis because
they have noticed a fishy or musty smell from the vagina. The
smell may get stronger after sexual intercourse. Also, there may
be a vaginal discharge. The amount can vary from a little to a
lot. The discharge is usually like white paste but can be thin
and watery, frothy, or yellow. A few women also have soreness of
the vulva (area surrounding the vagina).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="How">How Bacterial Vaginosis is Diagnosed</a></h3>
<p>A doctor will examine a woman&#146;s vagina for discharge,
using an instrument called a speculum. Sometimes a sample of the
discharge is placed on a glass slide and a chemical (potassium
chloride) is added, or the acidity of the discharge is tested on
litmus paper. If the woman has bacterial vaginosis, adding the
chemical to the sample will make a smell the same as that which
the woman may already have noticed.</p>
<p>A discharge sample may also be sent to a laboratory to test
for &#145;clue cells&#146;&#150; vaginal wall cells covered with
the Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria. However, even if clue cells
are found, treatment may not be needed. Some women have these
cells normally.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Prevention">Prevention and Treatment</a></h3>
<p>After going to the toilet, always wipe from the front to the
back (from the vaginal area back to the anus). After using
bowels, wipe until the paper is clean, or wash the area with a
soft cloth. Wipe gently, never so hard that the vaginal area is
scratched or sore.</p>
<p>Sexual intercourse causes small abrasions. Bacteria may
possibly infect or multiply at these sites. Women who have
bacterial vaginosis should thoroughly wash and dry their genital
area after sexual intercourse. </p>
<p>Not using tampons may help some women who are experiencing
problems with bacterial vaginosis, as it is possible that tampons
may alter the normal balance of vaginal bacteria.</p>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis is most usually treated with tablets
called metronidazole or tinidazole. These are given either in a
single four-tablet dose or, if the problem is a recurring one, as
a more extensive course of tablets. While taking metronidazole,
no alcohol should be consumed as severe nausea may result from
drinking even small amounts of alcohol. Pregnant women with
bacterial vaginosis need to seek specialist advice about
treatment, as metronidazole tablets are not appropriate during
early pregnancy.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment</a> of Sexual Partners</h3>
<p>In most cases, no treatment is prescribed for the sexual
partner of a woman with bacterial vaginosis as the condition is
not an infection, but a bacterial imbalance.</p>
<p>For further advice about and treatment of bacterial vaginosis,
women should see their doctor.</p>

<p>Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder caused by an
infection of the urinary tract and affects women more than men.</p>
<p>If you have pain and discomfort when urinating you could have
cystitis.</p>
<p>Left untreated it can cause serious kidney infection.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="How">How you get it</a></h3>
<p>Most cystitis infections are caused by bacteria which live in
the bowel. They are harmless in the bowel but cause problems when
they reach the urethra. This can occur during sex of if you wipe
yourself from back to front after opening your bowels.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Symptoms">Symptoms of cystitis</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>burning or scalding when passing urine</li>
    <li>a desire to pass urine frequently</li>
    <li>a persistent dull ache above the pelvic bone particularly
        after passing urine</li>
    <li>urine which smells or contains blood or pus.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a cystitis attack goes untreated, backache, fever or bouts
of shivering may develop. This could mean the infection has
reached the kidneys. See a doctor immediately. This infection can
cause long-term kidney damage.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment for cystitis</a></h3>
<p>If you suspect cystitis, see a doctor. Antibiotics and rest
are usually prescribed.</p>
<p>Symptoms should disappear after a few days&#146; treatment,
but it is important to complete the full course of antibiotics
because the infection may still be there. If the antibiotics
don&#146;t help, see the doctor again. A different antibiotic may
be needed.</p>
<p>The doctor may also check for other causes. This check could
include a pelvic examination to ensure the vagina is healthy or
an X-ray of the urinary system.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Otherhealth">Other health problems and cystitis</a></h3>
<p>Sexually transmissible diseases (STDs) commonly cause
infection of the urethra too. You should always consider the
possibility of an STD when you have cystitis.</p>
<p>Other reasons for cystitis include underlying health problems
such as kidney stones, growths and abnormalities of the urinary
tract.</p>
<p>Women who have diabetes are more prone to cystitis attacks.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Self-help">Self-help for symptoms</a></h3>
<p>It is important to see your doctor if you have cystitis, as
most infections need a course of antibiotics. The following
self-help treatments may relieve the symptoms if you feel an
attack coming on, but they are not intended as a substitute for
medical treatment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>drink half a litre of water and then a quarter of a litre
        of fluid every 20 minutes until you are passing large
        volumes of urine.</li>
    <li>take aspirin or paracetamol if you are in pain.</li>
    <li>put a hot water bottle on your back and another between
        your legs, have a warm bath or put the electric blanket
        on and go to bed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Reducing">Reducing the chances of attack by cystitis</a></h3>
<p>If you are prone to cystitis you should:</p>
<ul>
    <li>wash your vulva and anus with mild soap.</li>
    <li>don&#146;t use heavily perfumed soaps or sprays.</li>
    <li>always wipe yourself from front to back after opening
        your bowels.</li>
    <li>wear cotton underpants and avoid tight jeans, synthetic
        pants or nylon tights.</li>
    <li>use a water-based lubricant when having sex.</li>
    <li>pass urine within ten minutes of having sex.</li>
    <li>drink plenty of water - one and a half to two litres a
        day.</li>
    <li>avoid alcohol. It dehydrates the body, making the urine
        concentrated and acidic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could trigger an attack.</p>
<ul>
    <li>go to the toilet often. Don&#146;t hold on to urine.</li>
    <li>use plain toilet paper. The dyes in coloured paper could
        cause irritation.</li>
    <li>get plenty of rest.</li>
    <li>ensure you eat a balanced diet.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Feelings">Feelings</a></h3>
<p>People who learn they have cystitis can feel embarrassed,
depressed and anxious.</p>
<p>Talk it through with your doctor, a counsellor or others who
have the same problem.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Where">Where to go</a></h3>
<p>Advice and treatment for cystitis are available from:</p>

<hr>
<p>Having genital herpes can be a pain, but it&#146;s not the end
of the world.</p>
<p>These blisters on the genitals (sex organs) have a lot in
common with the &#145;cold sores&#146; people get on the lips and
mouth.</p>
<p>Both are caused by the herpes viruses. And once you&#146;ve
got the herpes virus, the sores sometimes break out again and
again, especially when you&#146;re tired or tense.</p>
<p>But the good news about genital herpes is that half the people
who get infected never get more than one outbreak.</p>
<p>And if you do have more outbreaks, there are plenty of things
you can do about it.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="How">How do you get it</a></h3>
<p>You get genital herpes virus through genital, oral or anal sex
with an already infected person who is shedding the virus,
whether they have sores or not.</p>
<p>Once you&#146;ve got the virus, it stays in your body. The
virus is most easily transmitted when you have an outbreak of
blisters, but the herpes virus can also be transmitted when there
are no sores seen.</p>
<p>You are most infectious from the first signs that sores are
developing until the scabs fall off.</p>
<p>You should avoid sex while you have herpes sores.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="What">What happens</a></h3>
<p>The very first herpes outbreak is usually the most severe. Any
later flare-ups are often milder.</p>
<p>At the start, the infected part of your genitals might feel
sore, or tingling. You might also feel generally unwell, as if
you are getting flu. Then, small blisters appear. They burst and
become ulcers. Later, scabs form and finally the skin heals. In
females, this can be around the vagina, the urethra, the cervix,
or between the vagina and the anus.</p>
<p>In males, sores are usually on the penis and foreskin and
sometime inside the urethra, on the scrotum or in the area
between the penis and the anus.</p>
<p>The sores usually heal within one or two weeks.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Whattodo">What to do</a></h3>
<p>If you&#146;re having your first-ever outbreak of herpes - or
think you might be - it&#146;s important to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Go as soon as possible, because that&#146;s the best time to
test whether you have the virus and start treatment if considered
necessary.</p>
<p>A cotton wool slab is rubbed on the blister or sore to get a
sample of the virus, and this is sent to a laboratory.</p>
<p>The drug Acyclovir may be prescribed for a severe outbreak. It
does not cure herpes but may ease the symptoms. It should not be
taken if you are pregnant. People with HIV infection are
recommended to take Acyclovir if they have an episode of herpes.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Other">Other useful treatments</a>:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you can feel herpes developing but blisters have not
        yet appeared, wrap an iceblock in a towel and apply it
        frequently to the tender areas for an hour. Often this
        stops blisters forming.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Bathe sores with salt water (2 teaspoons of salt per
        litre or 1 cup in a bath).<br>
    </li>
    <li>Keep sores clean and dry; a product like Betadine can be
        useful.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Drink plenty of water.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If it hurts to urinate, you can try while sitting in warm
        water.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Wear loose cotton undies and avoid tight jeans or
        pantyhose.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Have plenty of rest.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Take painkillers such as aspirin or paracetamol if
        necessary. In the primary outbreak, these drugs can also
        reduce fever.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Lateron">Later on</a></h3>
<p>There are some things which may cause future herpes outbreaks.</p>
<p>Feeling stressed - that is, feeling worried or unhappy or
tense - is one of the main reasons behind fresh outbreaks.
Getting very tired and run down won&#146;t help either. So
getting enough rest, eating well, exercising, and learning how to
relax are all really positive things you can do.</p>
<p>You can also get to know what things trigger your outbreaks
and try to avoid them. For example, some people find too much
sunlight can stir up herpes.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Protecting">Protecting yourself and your partner</a></h3>
<p>Avoid sex while you have herpes sores whether on the genitals
or in the mouth. You are most infectious from the first signs
that the sores are developing until the scabs have gone. You may
also be infectious at other times.</p>
<p>Use condoms during sex as they lower the risk of you and your
partner getting genital herpes and other STDs.</p>
<p>Talking about STDs can be really difficult, but any person you
have had or will have sex with has a right to know if you have
herpes. You could plan to discuss it when you are feeling relaxed
and confident. (It is probably best not to leave it until just
before you have sex).</p>
<p>The fewer people you have sex with, the less chance of contact
with someone with an STD.</p>
<p>Have regular check-ups for herpes and other STDs.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Pregnancy">Pregnancy and herpes</a></h3>
<p>If you become pregnant and you or your partner has ever had
herpes you must tell your doctor.</p>
<p>If herpes is transmitted to the baby at birth, it may be
mentally or physically disabled. Your doctor will assess whether
normal delivery is possible.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Feelings</h3>
<p>People who learn they have herpes can feel guilty, depressed,
anxious or just plain angry. Talk it through with your doctor, a
counsellor or others who have had the same problem.</p>

<hr>
<p>Genital warts are small lumps on the genitals which you can
see or feel and which are usually painless. They may be harmless
but they should be checked by a doctor.</p>
<p>They are caused by the genital wart virus (Papilloma virus).</p>
<p>Warts can be found on the vagina, vulva, cervix, mouth, throat
or penis, and sometimes around the anus. Genital warts are
different from those seen on the hands and knees.</p>
<p>You usually catch genital warts by having sex with someone who
has the genital wart virus. It can take several weeks to months
before the warts appear.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Why">Why</a> warts are important</h3>
<p>Untreated warts are highly infectious and can be passed on to
your partners.</p>
<p>In girls and women, wart virus may increase the risk of
cervical cancer. In males, there is a slight risk that untreated
warts could develop into cancer of the penis.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Couldyou">Could you have warts?</a></h3>
<p>Many sexually active people have the genital wart virus.</p>
<p>Warts may not always be visible, such as when they occur on
the cervix (the neck of the uterus). But, if you see or feel
unusual lumps on your genitals, or if you have had sex with
someone who has warts, then see a doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor can check for warts and any other disease passed on
by sex.</p>
<p>Your partner should also be checked.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p>Genital warts can be removed by doctors in several ways. They
can be painted or removed by freezing or burning. Repeat
treatments may be necessary.</p>
<p>Doctors will often prescribe podophyllin or podophyllotoxin
paint for warts. If this burns your skin, wash it off immediately
and ask for different treatment. It is important to follow the
doctor&#146;s instructions.</p>
<p>Paint should not be used inside the vagina, urethra, rectum or
the mouth. You should not use podophyllin paint if you&#146;re
pregnant.</p>
<p>Do not have sex when you have warts you can see or feel. You
should avoid sex till the treatment is finished. Following
treatment, condoms should be used for six months. This is the
time when warts are most likely to recur.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Papsmears">Pap smears</a></h3>
<p>Because there is a chance that wart virus can lead to cancer
of the cervix, an annual Pap smear is essential for girls and
women who have the wart virus.</p>
<p>The Pap smear is a simple test which can be done in a
doctor&#146;s surgery (or Health Clinic). Cell samples are taken
from the cervix, then tested in a laboratory.</p>
<p>A Pap smear shows if the virus has caused any changes to the
cells in your cervix. Any changed cells can then be treated, well
before cancer develops.</p>
<p>Note: Any girl or woman who has started to have sex should
have a Pap smear every two years. Pap smears are the only way to
check whether the cervix is healthy and if treatment is needed.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Smoking">Smoking</a></h3>
<p>Girls and women who have wart virus infection and who also
smoke have a much greater than average risk of developing
cervical cancer. This is another good reason to give up smoking,
or even better, not to start.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Protecting">Protecting yourself and your partner</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The safest way to protect against genital warts and other
        STDs is:<br>
        - to have a long-term exclusive relationship where
        neither you nor your partner is already infected;<br>
        - to ensure that neither of you has other sexual
        partners. <br>
    </li>
    <li>The fewer people you have sex with, the less likely you
        are to come in contact with someone who has an infection
        of warts or other STDs. Common sexually transmissible
        diseases include chlamydia, herpes and gonorrhoea.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Don&#146;t have sex when you have genital warts and at
        all other times, use a condom. Condoms lower the risk of
        catching or passing on genital warts.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Talking about STDs can be really difficult, but any
        person you have had, or will have sex with, has a right
        to know if you have had genital warts. You could plan to
        discuss it when you are feeling relaxed and confident.
        (It is probably best not to leave it until just before
        you have sex.)<br>
    </li>
    <li>Have regular STD check-ups at a doctor&#146;s surgery or
        any of the centres listed below.</li>

<hr>
<p>Gonorrhoea (&#145;the clap&#146;) is a disease you catch by
having sex with someone who is infected with the gonorrhoea
bacteria.</p>
<p>Gonorrhoea can have serious consequences. If it spreads and
damages reproductive organs, young men and women with the disease
might never be able to have children.</p>
<p>In rare cases, the disease can spread to the joints, heart and
brain.</p>
<p>If a pregnant woman gets gonorrhoea, the baby&#146;s eyes can
be infected at birth, and if not treated, the infection may
result in blindness.</p>
<p>So it&#146;s vital to see a doctor as soon as possible if you
could have gonorrhoea. Fortunately there is quick, simple
treatment available.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Signs">Signs</a> of gonorrhoea</h3>
<p>Both men and women can have gonorrhoea, and sometimes there
are no symptoms.</p>
<p>However, within a week of infection males usually have a
yellow discharge from the penis and a burning sensation on
passing urine.</p>
<p>Women may notice unusual vaginal discharge or pain on
urination, but many may not have symptoms unless infection
spreads to the uterine tubes. This can cause abdominal pain, or
pain on intercourse.</p>
<p>Although gonorrhoea is mostly caught from penis-vagina
intercourse, it can also be passed on through oral or anal sex. A
sore throat or rectal discharge could be symptoms of gonorrhoea.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Checking">Checking it out</a></h3>
<p>If you or your partner have any of the symptoms already
described - or if you are having sex with several people and
don&#146;t know whether they have an infection - then check with
a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Swabs can then be taken from the parts of your body likely to
be affected, and tested in a laboratory.</p>
<p>All the sexual partners of someone who has gonorrhoea will
also need to be checked.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p>Gonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics. The treatment varies
depending where you caught the disease. Tell the doctor if this
was interstate or overseas. After treatment is finished a test is
done again to make certain the infection has been cured. Sex must
be avoided till the treatment is finished.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Protecting">Protecting yourself and your partner</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The safest way to protect against gonorrhoea and other
        STDs is:<br>
        - to have a long-term exclusive relationship where
        neither you nor your partner is already infected;<br>
        - to ensure that neither of you has other sexual
        partners; and<br>
    </li>
    <li>The fewer people you have sex with, the less your chance
        of contact with someone who has gonorrhoea.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Use condoms. A condom is a barrier against bacteria and
        viruses.<br>
    </li>
    <li>If you think you might have been exposed to gonorrhoea,
        have a check-up at a doctor&#146;s surgery or any of the
        centres listed below. Early treatment will cure the
        disease and stop it spreading to others. Mention to the
        doctor if you think you may have caught gonorrhoea
        overseas or interstate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Feelings">Feelings</a></h3>
<p>People who learn they have gonorrhoea can feel guilty,
depressed, anxious or angry.</p>
<p>Talk it through with your doctor, a counsellor or others who
have the same problem. Psychologists and counsellors are
available at the STD clinics.</p>

<hr>
<p>Syphilis is one of the oldest known sexually transmissible
diseases. It is serious and can have fatal complications if not
treated.</p>
<h3><a name="How">How you get it</a></h3>
<p>The organism that causes syphilis enters the body during close
physical contact with somebody who has the disease, usually
during sex. It enters the bloodstream through a break in the skin
and begins the slow, steady work of destruction.</p>
<p>In a woman, the break in the skin could be inside the vagina.
She might be unaware that she has the disease and could pass it
on to her sex partner without realising it.</p>
<p>While it is a very serious disease, syphilis can be cured,
especially if diagnosed in the early stages and treated with
penicillin.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Symptoms">Symptoms of syphilis</a></h3>
<p>The first sign of syphilis is usually an ulcer or sore, in or
near the genital area. This appears about three to twelve weeks
after infection. The ulcer can be any size or shape and is called
a chancre. It is usually painless, does not bleed and feels like
a hard button under the skin.</p>
<p>Even without treatment the ulcer will disappear after a couple
of weeks. This can lead the infected person into believing that
the suspected problem has cured itself. But it is at this first
stage <strong>(Primary Stage)</strong> that the organism,
Treponema pallidum, gets into the blood stream and spreads
throughout the body.</p>
<p>If the disease is not treated, some two to six months after
the initial infection the person may develop a skin rash. The
rash is the most obvious symptom. It can appear on the face, palm
of hands and soles of feet. In fair-haired people the rash is
usually coppery-red while in dark-skinned people it tis usually
dark grey.</p>
<p>Other symptoms may include a sore throat, enlarged lymph
glands, lumps around the moist areas of the body and loss of
hair. Headaches, pains in the bones, muscles and joints may also
occur. The bacteria may also affect a person&#146;s hearing. This <strong>Secondary
Stage</strong> may last for six months or longer.</p>
<p>Without treatment, the disease progresses into the <strong>Latent
Stage</strong> where there are no visible symptoms. The disease
may seem to disappear for as long as 20 years, however the
infection is still inside the body.</p>
<p>The damage caused by the disease eventually shows in about 10
per cent of people. The disease may affect the brain, heart,
large blood vessels, the spinal cord, skin and bones. This <strong>Tertiary</strong>
or <strong>Final Stage</strong> is the most serious and can be
fatal.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Diagnosis">Diagnosis</a></h3>
<p>In the primary stage, diagnosis of syphilis is made by
examining the discharge from the ulcer under a microscope. The
diagnosis can be confirmed by a special blood test. The blood is
sent to a laboratory for testing and the result is normally known
in a few days.</p>
<p>If the disease is diagnosed and treated adequately at this
early stage, the person will have no further problems. If
untreated, the ulcer will heal, but the symptoms of secondary
syphilis may begin to appear within six to eight weeks. At this
stage and later stages the special blood test is the main method
of diagnosis.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment</a></h3>
<p>Penicillin is the main drug used to treat syphilis.</p>
<p>Treatment in the primary, secondary and latent stages ideally
consists of a penicillin injection every day for two weeks.</p>
<p>If the infected person is allergic to penicillin, other drugs
may be used instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Important">Important points</a></h3>
<p>People infected with syphilis are infectious, particularly
during the first and second stages. <strong>They should avoid all
sexual contact until they have been given the all-clear by their
doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is very important that anyone being treated for
syphilis has the full course of treatment and does not miss going
to the doctor on the required treatment days.</strong></p>
<p>All people who are treated for syphilis must have blood tests
for at least two years after treatment to make certain they are
cured. It is important also to be checked for other STDs.</p>
<p>It is very important, where possible, to trace all sexual
contacts so that they can be tested and treated. This will
prevent further spread of the disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Syphilis">Syphilis and pregnancy</a></h3>
<p>A pregnant woman who has syphilis can pass it on to her unborn
baby. If found early in pregnancy, the syphilis can be treated by
antibiotics which may prevent damage to the baby. If untreated,
the baby may be born dead or badly damaged. Syphilis in a baby is
known as <strong>congenital syphilis</strong>.</p>

<p>Vaginal thrush is an irritating and sometimes painful
condition which affects many women and can be spread by sexual
contact. Men may also be affected, but usually less severely.
Repeated attacks may cause women to feel depressed and lose
interest in sex. Sexual intercourse is likely to become painful
and may bring on further attacks of vaginal thrush.</p>

<h3><a name="Causes">Causes of thrush</a></h3>
<p>Vaginal thrush is caused by a fungus called Candida albicans
which thrives in warm, moist places such as the mouth, the
intestine, the vagina or under the foreskin of uncircumcised men.</p>
<p>Because it occurs so widely and reproduces itself rapidly, it
is very easy for thrush to grow if the conditions are right.</p>
<p>The normal vaginal bacteria and the vaginal environment itself
usually check the grow of the Candida fungus, but if these
change, the fungus may multiply rapidly, producing symptoms of
thrush.</p>
<p>Thrush is more likely to occur in the following situations:</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="Treatment">Treatment of thrush</a></h3>
<p>As soon as symptoms are noticed it is important to see a</p>
<p>doctor to have a swab taken for testing. This makes sure that
it is Candida and not some other vaginal infection or a
combination of infections.</p>
<p>Doctors usually prescribe vaginal cream or pessaries for
women. These are large tablets that are inserted into the vagina.
Treatment may begin immediately to ease the irritation, even if
it is a few days before the diagnosis is confirmed by the
laboratory. It is important to complete the course of treatment,
even if a period occurs while still using the tablets or cream.</p>
<p>Repeated outbreaks of thrush may be an indication of other
health problems, so it is important to see a doctor. If there are
repeated outbreaks, it may also be necessary for any sex partners
to be treated, to prevent reinfection. The same cream should be
applied to the penis and genital area. Uncircumcised men should
be careful to apply the cream under the foreskin.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="WhatisAustralianEncephalitis"><em>What
is Australian Encephalitis</em></a><em>?</em></h3>
<p>Australian encephalitis (AE) is a rare but serious disease. It
occurs following infection with either of two mosquito-borne
viruses, Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus or Kunjin virus.
These viruses occur naturally throughout the northern half of
Australia, Papua New Guinea and eastern Indonesia, and
occasionally in inland south-eastern Australia.</p>
<p>In nature, MVE and Kunjin survive in natural cycles involving
birds (especially water birds) and some species of mosquito. The
only way humans can catch AE is by being bitten by a
virus-carrying mosquito. The viruses cannot be caught directly
from other people or birds.</p>
<p>Approximately one person in a thousand will develop disease
symptoms after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Most do not
develop any disease symptoms at all.</p>
<p>A doctor who diagnoses AE in a patient must inform the Health
Department of Western Australia. Public warnings can then be
issued for people to take preventive measures against catching
the disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Symptoms"><em>Symptoms</em></a><em>
of Australian Encephalitis</em></h3>
<p>Adults who have grown up in areas where AE viruses occur in
the wild are usually immune from natural infection during
childhood. Most cases occur in people who have had no previous
exposure to the disease, such as very young children or people
who have recently arrived in the area.</p>
<p>The incubation period varies from five to fifteen days, but
symptoms usually appear within eight to ten days after being
infected.</p>
<p>The disease can be mild or severe, but early symptoms are the
same in either case. They include general discomfort and loss of
appetite, followed by fever, bad headache and stiff neck,
drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, muscle tremors and dizziness.
Sometimes a fine rash may occur. In mild cases, the patient will
start to improve after five to ten days.</p>
<p>Patients with the severe form of AE get worse very quickly
with confusion and worsening headaches. They find it hard to
breathe, will twitch and convulse and soon become unconscious.
Patients either get better or die within two weeks. It may take
several months to recover and some people are left paralysed or
with brain damage.</p>
<p>There is no way of telling who will get a mild illness with AE
and who will get the severe form. However, evidence from earlier
outbreaks of AE suggests that children are more likely to develop
the more severe pattern of illness.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Treatment"><em>Treatment</em></a><em>
of Australian Encephalitis</em></h3>
<p>There is no vaccine to prevent Australian encephalitis, and
there is no medical cure. People with AE should be taken to the
nearest hospital with intensive care facilities, whether their
symptoms are mild or severe. There, they will receive treatment
and medicine to control convulsions if necessary and until they
regain consciousness. While they are recovering, they will often
need physiotherapy, speech therapy and other rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Even with appropriate medical care, up to 20% of people who
become ill with AE will die. Of eight AE cases in Western
Australia reported during the 1992-93 wet season, three people
died.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Whenandwhere"><em>When and where</em></a><em>
does Australian Encephalitis occur?</em></h3>
<p>Australian encephalitis occurs in the northern half of
Australia for up to three months following heavy summer and
autumn rain. February to April is the season of most risk, but
this can extend to June or even July in very wet years.</p>
<p>The main areas of risk in Western Australia are the Kimberley
and Pilbara regions and, on rare occasions, the Gascoyne. The
virus is active in the Kimberley during every wet season, but
only after very heavy summer rainfall in the Pilbara and
Gascoyne. No cases have been recorded in the southern half of the
State.</p>
<p>In south-eastern Australia, it can occur during unseasonably
wet summers when the Murray Darling river system floods.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Howtoprevent"><em>How to prevent</em></a><em>
Australian Encephalitis</em></h3>
<p><em><strong>1. Mosquito Control</strong></em></p>
<p>Effective mosquito control is currently not possible in areas
of Western Australia where AE occurs. This is because the
mosquito breeding areas which require treatment are large and
hard to reach. Some local authorities do carry out insecticide
fogging to kill adult mosquitoes, but this is only partially
effective and cannot be relied upon for effective AE prevention.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. Avoid Mosquitoes</strong></em></p>
<p>Adult mosquitoes are very susceptible to desiccation (drying
out), so they are much less active during daylight and in windy
conditions than at night or on cloudy, humid, still days. They
are usually most active for one to three hours after sunset and
again around dawn. It is therefore possible to reduce the risk of
contracting Australian encephalitis by timing outdoor activities
to avoid periods of greatest mosquito activity. Plan barbecues
for afternoon rather than after sunset and arrange outdoor
sporting activities straight after work or during the daytime on
weekends rather than during summer evenings after sunset.</p>
<p><em><strong>3. Cover Up, Use Repellents</strong></em></p>
<p>Cover up with loose clothing to prevent mosquito bites -
remember that mosquitoes can bite through clothing which is tight
against the skin (even denim jeans). When outdoors, particularly
after sunset, carry an effective mosquito repellent for use if
mosquitoes are around. The best repellents contain between 5 and
20 per cent (50 - 200g/litre) n, n-diethyl toluamide (DEET).</p>
<p>DEET is the most effective mosquito repellent known. However,
as with all chemicals it should be applied in accordance with the
instructions, especially to infants and young children.</p>
<p>Repellents are more effective in a lotion than in roll-on or
spray-can form.</p>
<p><em><strong>4. Camping</strong></em></p>
<p>Make sure tents are secure with all zips working and that
windows are fitted with effective flyscreens. If sleeping under
the stars, use a mosquito bed net over your sleeping bag (even
the best repellents only last up to four hours, so they are not
effective all night). When outside tents, cover up and wear a
repellent.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="What"><font size="4"><em>What are
Ross River Virus</em></font></a><font size="4"><em> and Barmah
Forest Virus?</em></font></h3>
<p>Two of the most important mosquito-borne viruses in Western
Australia in terms of human disease are Ross River (RR) virus and
Barmah Forest (BF) virus. Both viruses cause epidemic
polyarthritis, also known as RR virus disease or BF virus
disease. The two viruses have similar life cycles and cause
similar symptoms in people.</p>
<p>In nature the RR and BF viruses are passed back and forth
between animals and mosquitoes. The only way humans can catch the
disease is through being bitten by a virus-carrying mosquito. RR
and BF virus cannot be caught from direct contact with another
person or animal.</p>
<p>The incubation period for both diseases varies from three days
to three weeks, but symptoms usually appear within seven to
fourteen days. Fewer than one in three people will develop
symptoms after being bitten by an infected mosquito. It is
possible for humans to pass the virus back to mosquitoes which
bite them during the end of the incubation period or the first
few days after the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>RR and BF diseases are notifiable under the Health Act. This
means a doctor who diagnoses either virus in a patient is
required to inform the Health Department of WA so that public
warnings can be issued.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Symptoms"><font size="4"><em>Symptoms
of Ross River</em></font></a><font size="4"><em> and Barmah
Forest Virus diseases</em></font></h3>
<p>People suffering from RR virus disease or BF virus disease may
develop a wide range of symptoms which are common to both
diseases.</p>
<p>The symptoms vary from person to person but include painful
and/or swollen joints, sore muscles, aching tendons, skin rashes,
fever, fatigue, headaches and swollen lymph nodes. Less common
symptoms include sore eyes, a sore throat, nausea, and tingling
in the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.</p>
<p>The symptoms may be very similar to some rheumatic diseases
and can only be reliably diagnosed by a specific blood test
ordered by a doctor.</p>
<p>Pain in the joints is much more common than swelling. The most
commonly affected joints are the wrists, knees, ankles, fingers,
elbows, shoulders and jaw. Pain usually develops rapidly and may
be intense, and more severe in different joints at different
times.</p>
<p>When they are severe, the symptoms can cause emotional
distress or depression, and can affect family, social and work
relationships. </p>
<p>The symptoms in children tend to be milder and the disease
runs a shorter course.</p>
<p>A rash tends to be more common to BF virus disease and swollen
joints may not last as long as with RR virus disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Howlong"><font size="4"><em>How long
do the symptoms last</em></font></a><font size="4"><em>?</em></font></h3>
<p>Fever, nausea and skin rash usually disappear within the first
two weeks of illness. Joint, muscle and tendon pain may last much
longer and can be distressing. Some people also have lingering
fatigue, lethargy and depression.</p>
<p>Symptoms subside eventually and leave few or no after-effects.
It is not possible to predict how long an individual person will
take to fully recover from either disease.</p>
<p>Some adults recover within two to six weeks after the onset of
infection. However, most people will still be unwell at three
months, about half will still have persistent joint pains and
lethargy at six months, and about a quarter will have some
symptoms after a year. Up to 10 per cent may have residual
symptoms of RR virus disease after two years.</p>
<p>Research suggests that BF virus disease infection may last for
a shorter time than RR virus disease. Research into the long-term
effects of both diseases is still being conducted.</p>
<p>People with persistent symptoms are not sick all the time.
After three months, many experience days when they are well and
as time goes by these times become more frequent. However,
symptoms may recur suddenly and without warning.</p>
<p>Most people who have suffered from RR or BF virus infection
are immune to the same disease in the future, although there have
been a few rare cases of people developing RR virus more than
once in their lifetime. Unfortunately, people who have been
infected with RR virus are not immune to BF virus, and vice
versa.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Treatment"><font size="4"><em>Treatment</em></font></a></h3>
<p>There is no vaccine to prevent either disease and there is no
medical cure once infection is contracted.</p>
<p>Medical treatment is aimed at easing joint pains and swelling,
and minimising fatigue and lethargy. For some people, simple pain
killers, such as aspirin or paracetamol, are sufficient. Others
will require stronger medications to ease the inflammation.</p>
<p>Gentle exercise, stress management, physiotherapy and plenty
of rest (particularly in the early stages of infection) are all
important. Some people find hydrotherapy or gentle swimming in a
heated pool very beneficial.</p>
<p>Emotional stress, physical fatigue and alcohol may cause
symptoms to worsen or last longer. People with long-term symptoms
require emotional support and understanding. They should always
keep in mind that they will eventually get well.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="When"><font size="4"><em>When and
where can</em></font></a><font size="4"><em> you catch the
viruses?</em></font></h3>
<p>RR and BF viruses occur anywhere in Western Australia when
conditions are warm enough for the viruses to be active and wet
enough for the breeding of mosquitoes. </p>
<p>In the northern half of WA, it is warm enough for both viruses
to be active at any time of the year whenever heavy rainfall or
unusually high tides occur.</p>
<p>In the south, RR virus can be active at any time between
September and May if sufficient rainfall or unusually high tides
occur. This potential activity period is slightly shorter in the
colder areas along the south coast and slightly longer in the
warmer areas around Geraldton /Kalbarri.</p>
<p>BF virus is also active during these periods, but evidence
indicates that the virus may be active in slightly cooler
temperatures when there is sufficient rainfall or high tides.</p>
<p>In the southern half of WA the area of greatest risk is the
coastal plain between Mandurah and Busselton during spring and
early summer.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Howto"><font size="4"><em>How to
prevent infection</em></font></a></h3>
<p>Several mosquito species are known to carry RR virus and BF
virus. The Health Department of WA, in collaboration with local
government, conducts mosquito control programs in some of the
worst mosquito breeding areas. However, despite this, these
viruses will always be a threat because it is not possible to
eliminate all mosquitoes. Therefore, it is important for people
to take personal measures to reduce the risk of contracting
mosquito-borne diseases.</p>
<p><em><strong>Avoid mosquitoes</strong></em></p>
<p>Mosquitoes are usually most active for one to three hours
after sunset and again around dawn. Reduce the risk of
contracting RR or BF virus by timing outdoor activities to avoid
periods of greatest mosquito activity. Plan barbecues for the
afternoon rather than after sunset.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cover up, use repellents</strong></em></p>
<p>Cover up with loose clothing to prevent mosquito bites;
remember mosquitoes can bite through clothing that is tight
against the skin (even denim jeans). When outdoors, carry an
effective mosquito repellent. The most effective repellents
contain between 5 and 20 per cent (50-200g/litre) n n diethyl
toluamide (DEET), and are most effective in lotion form. DEET is
the most effective mosquito repellent known. However, as with all
chemicals, it should be applied in accordance with the
instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Repellents containing greater than 20% DEET should not
be applied to infants and young children.</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>When camping</strong></em></p>
<p>Make sure tents are in good repair and are fitted with
effective flyscreens. If sleeping under the stars, use a mosquito
bed net over your sleeping bag. Even the best repellents only
last up to four hours, so they are not effective all night. When
outside the tent, cover up and wear a repellent.</p>
<p><em><strong>Control backyard mosquito breeding</strong></em></p>
<p>Mosquitoes can breed in a variety of domestic situations. They
need only a week or so in a small amount of standing water to
breed. Examples include:</p>

<p>Young children are not aware of the dangers of playing and
swimming in doubtful water and should be protected by those who
do know.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="What"><em>What</em></a><em> is it?</em></h3>
<p>Amoebic meningitis is an inflammation of the brain and brain
linings caused by a single celled organism (Naegleria fowleri, an
amoeba) that lives in fresh water. It can survive in soil as a
cyst and is reactivated when put in fresh water.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Howdoyougetit"><em>How do you get it?</em></a></h3>
<p>You can get amoebic meningitis only if water containing the
amoebae goes up the nose. The amoebae can then make their way up
the nerves to the brain.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Wheredoyougetit"><em>Where do you get
it?</em></a></h3>
<p>You can get amoebic meningitis from warm inland waters,
unchlorinated or incorrectly chlorinated water, dams, or
waterholes, but not from sea water or salty estuaries (more than
two per cent salt). The amoebae thrive in water temperatures
between 28&#176; and 40&#176;C.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Whendoyougetit"><em>When do you get
it?</em></a></h3>
<p>It&#146;s a rare disease, but there is a chance you could get
amoebic meningitis when a number of conditions occur at the same
time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IF the amoebae are present in the water</li>
    <li>IF they get a chance to multiply</li>
    <li>IF water gets up your nose.</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Whatcanyoudoaboutit"><em>What can you
do about it?</em></a></h3>
<p>Swim and play in safe water only. Sea water is safe, and so
are swimming pools in top condition (free of dirt and debris).
Flowing streams and rivers where the water is cool (below
25&#176;C) have not been associated with the disease.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="WaterTreatment"><em>Water Treatment</em></a></h3>
<p>Chlorine for fresh water private pools is available in liquid,
powder or tablet form.</p>
<p>In salt water pools, the salt is converted to chlorine.
However, this process, known as electrolysis, may not produce
enough chlorine for Western Australian summer conditions.
Checking chlorine levels (see below) is essential, and you may
need to add extra chlorine.</p>
<p>Western Australia has adopted the following new pool chlorine
standards, recommended by the National Health and Medical
Research Council:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Unstabilised Pools:</strong> At all times,
        maintain a free chlorine level of at least 1mg/L (one
        milligram per litre) if the water temperature is less
        than 26&#176;C, and at least 2 mg/L if the temperature
        exceeds 26&#176;C.<br>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Stabilised Pools:</strong> Maintain free chlorine
        level at 2 mg/L for water temperatures less than
        26&#176;C and 3 mg/L for temperatures over 26&#176;C.</li>
</ul>
<p>Test cyanuric acid levels to monitor the strength of the
stabiliser. It should not exceed 60 mg/L. If it&#146;s out of
balance with the chlorine, treatment efficiency is reduced.</p>
<p>Water quality is best when the pH reading (measure of acid or
alkalinity) is held between 7.2 and 7.6. Check free chlorine and
pH levels regularly. DPD test kits are recommended for chlorine
levels, which should be tested before the first swim in the
morning and at least once more during the day when the weather is
hot or the pool is being used a lot.</p>
<p>Add corrective doses of chlorine after sunset each day, and
again at noon during the hot weather. If it is particularly sunny
or the pool is being used by many people for long periods, it may
be necessary to test the water more frequently and add corrective
chemical doses as necessary.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><a name="Whatotherprecautions"><em>What other
precautions can you take?</em></a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Stay out of hazardous water - dirty pools, waterholes,
        dams etc.</li>
    <li>If you do plan to use water you&#146;re not sure is safe,
        walk or lower yourself into it. Jumping in is risky. If
        you do jump, hold your nose. Don&#146;t &#145;duck
        dive&#146;.</li>
    <li>Keep wading pools clean. Empty them daily, scrub them and
        let them dry in the sun.</li>
    <li>Leave hoses and sprinklers for gardens only. Playing with
        them increases the risk of water getting up the nose.</li>
    <li>Let bath and shower taps run for a few minutes to flush
        out water that may have been lying in the pipes,
        especially if the weather is warm and you&#146;ve been
        away from home for more than a couple of days.</li>

<h3><a name="Edit">EDITORIAL</a></h3>
<p>The main news in this edition of the <em>Bulletin</em> is that
there are large numbers of notifications of cases Ross River
Virus (RRV) being received this year. At the time of publication,
265 cases have been notified during 1996. The highest rates are
among people living in the South West region. Previous epidemics
of RRV occurred in the South West in 1988-89 and 1991-92. The
virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and causes
significant morbidity, the commonest symptom being arthritis in
peripheral joints. A fever and a rash may also be present. </p>
<p>In this edition we include a preliminary report for
notifications of infectious diseases during 1995. During 1995,
over 9,000 notifications of infectious diseases were made, of
which Campylobacter and hepatitis C were the most common, each
accounting for over 1,000 notifications. Whereas for both
infections this may mean increased disease in the community, it
is also possible that the increases are due to increased testing
for these conditions, and more complete notification. For
hepatitis C, infection may have been acquired many years prior to
testing, and the availability of improved tests makes testing
more accessible. </p>
<p>While much of the data for 1995 are complete, some extra
cleaning is being enthusiastically undertaken by the Public
Health Unit staff in each region responsible for collecting
notification data. This process eliminates duplicate
notifications, and further checking with notifying doctors can
ensure completeness of basic demographics such as sex and
postcode of residence. </p>
<p>Cooperation from doctors in completing the notification forms
and returning them promptly to their local Public Health Unit, or
the Communicable Diseases Control Program of the Health
Department (metropolitan cases only), is always appreciated. For
cases of infectious disease where an immediate public health
response is required, for example typhoid or meningococcal
disease, please telephone or fax your Unit with the details of
the case. A list of the current notifiable diseases in Western
Australia and contact numbers of these Units appear below. </p>

<h3><a name="EpidemiComm">EPIDEMIOLOGICAL COMMENTS</a></h3>
<p><b>CAMPYLOBACTER<br>
</b>Most reports of campylobacter have been received from the
metropolitan and south west areas, consistent with greater
populations in these regions compared to others in the state.
Notification rates across regions are similar. Two hundred and
seventy six notifications have been received for the first six
weeks of 1996. </p>
<p><b>CHLAMYDIA<br>
</b>Number of cases have increased in 1996 compared to the same
period last year. However, it is interesting to note that the
increase has been mostly in males &#150; reflecting the
availability of urine testing for <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>. </p>
<p><b>LEGIONELLA<br>
</b>Five cases of <em>Legionella</em> infection were notified
during December and January. Most cases notified to the
Communicable Diseases Control Program showed antibodies to the
species <em>L longbeachae</em>, but one demonstrated a high titre
to <em>L. micdadei.</em> Two cases were managed in the community:
one of these was a sixty year old man with a poorly resolving
pneumonia. The other was a man in his sixties who had pleuritic
chest pain. This pain did not resolve with a cephalosporin, and
further investigations revealed a titre of 1:2048 to <em>L
longbeachae</em>. His infection responded well to erythromycin. </p>
<p>The proportion of community acquired cases of pneumonia due to <em>Legionella</em>
lies between 0.5% and 5%. </p>
<p><b>LEPTOSPIROSIS<br>
</b><em>Leptospira hardjii</em> was diagnosed in a 28 year old
slaughterman from Midland in December, bringing the number of
notifications of leptospirosis to five in 1995. Leptospirosis is
an occupational hazard for people who come in contact with urine
infected with leptospires, and this may include water or
vegetation which has become contaminated from infected animals
(domestic or wild). People who work with livestock should be
protected from contamination by wearing protective clothing such
as boots, aprons and gloves. </p>
<p><b>MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE<br>
</b>Four cases of meningococcal disease were notified during
December/January. A more unusual presentation was that of a
nineteen year old male who was admitted to hospital febrile,
delirious and with an altered mental state, four days after
initially becoming unwell. He was then diagnosed with
meningococcal meningitis. He had developed a rash on the second
day of his illness, but the significance of this was
unrecognised. </p>
<p>The typical meningococcal rash is petichial with pink macules,
and very rarely, vesicles. </p>
<p><b>RABBIT CALICIVIRUS<br>
</b>Further to our review of this virus in the last edition of
the <em>Bulletin</em>, there have been continued media reports.
It is important to stress that humans are <b>not</b> at risk from
the virus. </p>
<p>For over ten years , rabbit calicivirus has been widespread
throughout Europe and China in wild rabbits and rabbit farms.
During that time, there has been close contact between people and
diseased rabbits. No transmission of the virus to humans, or
illness related to the virus has been reported in the scientific
or medical literature. Blood tests have not revealed the presence
of antibodies of the virus in humans who have had contact with
the virus or diseased rabbits. </p>
<p>There is <b>no </b>plan at present to release rabbit
calicivirus in Western Australia. The virus will eventually
spread here as it is now on the Australian mainland. </p>
<p><b>ROSS RIVER VIRUS<br>
</b>Notifications of Ross River Virus (RRV) have reached epidemic
levels in January, when 79 cases were notified to HDWA. This
compares with doctor notifications for the months of November and
December 1995 when 13 and 6 cases respectively were notified.
Only five cases were notified in January 1995. The University of
Western Australia which collects data from other sources,
including laboratories, suggests over 400 new cases for January.
The sharp increase in this January's notifications reflects
transmission in late 1995 (Figure 2). </p>

<p>Routine surveillance for arboviruses carried out by the
University of Western Australia on behalf of Health Department of
Western Australia revealed that record numbers of the mosquito <em>Aedes
camptorhynchus</em> were detected in the Capel/Busselton areas in
late November and December. These mosquitoes persisted further
into the summer than usual, which was thought to have been
contributory to increased transmission. This phenomenon was
associated with two previous outbreaks of RRV in the South West
in 1988-9 and 1991-2. </p>
<p>Notification data showed the proportion of men and women
notified was similar, and most cases have been people in their
thirties or forties. </p>
<p>There is some concern that high tides in the Peel Region and
the rains along the south coast after Christmas may have enhanced
breeding conditions for mosquitoes. Particular care to avoid
mosquitoes is suggested in the South West, particularly in the
Peel Region and the area between Albany and Augusta. </p>
<p>A number of cases appear to have been referred from outer
Metropolitan areas, particularly semi-rural areas, where in the
previous epidemics in the South West in 1988-89 and 1991-92, <em>Aedes
camptorynchus</em> has been the mosquito most associated with
transmission of RRV. The role of <em>Aedes vigilax</em> in RRV
transmission in Western Australia, while known to be important in
other parts of Australia, is still being investigated. This
species has been found in larger numbers than usual this summer.
Accordingly public warnings of elevated levels of RRV risk were

<p>Case follow-ups suggest that significant numbers of people
have contracted RRV whilst on holidays in the South West over
Christmas/ New Year, particularly in the Busselton and Bunbury

numbers in the South West are decreasing from these high nimbers
late last year, people are strongly advised to protect themselves
from being bitten over the next couple of months. </p>

<p><b>RUBELLA<br>
</b>Cases of rubella continue to be notified from the
Metropolitan region and the South West. Numbers of notifications
across the state dropped to 19 in January 1996 from a peak of 84
in October 1995. </p>
<p><b>TETANUS<br>
</b>A sixty nine year old man was admitted to a metropolitan
intensive care unit in January with a clinical diagnosis of
tetanus. He was the third case of tetanus diagnosed in Perth
recently. In the preceding three days he had experienced malaise,
neck stiffness, dysphagia, trismus and spasms in his arms. He had
no history of trauma. A sinus operation three weeks earlier had
been uncomplicated. He had last had a tetanus vaccine 20 years
previously. </p>
<p>All three cases were over the age of fifty, suggesting waning
protection. While most people have had tetanus immunisations as
children it is important that immunisations continue every ten
years. ADT (Adult Diptheria Tetanus) or tetanus toxoid can be
used to boost tetanus immunity. Adsorbed tetanus toxoid provides
protection for ten years provided an initial course of at least
three injections has been completed. </p>
<p><em>The Health Department of Western Australia recommends
routine DTP (Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis) at 2,4, 6 and 18
months, and at 4-5 years. The first Adult Diptheria/Tetanus (ADT)
immunisation is recommended at 12-15 years, followed by 10 yearly
boosters thereafter. </em></p>
<p>Tetanus (lockjaw) is a serious illness caused by the exotoxin
of the tetanus bacillus. The bacteria are ubiquitous in the
environment, and infection is caused by the spores entering the
body through a puncture wound containing soil, dust or faeces.
While contaminated wounds are at greater risk of tetanus, cases
can occur after very minor wounds. </p>
<p><b>TYPHOID<br>
</b>Further investigations of contacts of a locally acquired case
of typhoid in a young Vietnamese girl reported in the December
issue of this <em>Bulletin</em> have not revealed potential
sources of infection other than among three close relatives.
Faecal sampling after six weeks of ciprofloxacin in these
presumably chronic cases has not identified further <em>S typhi</em>. </p>
<p>It is thought that the little girl acquired her acute
infection through eating in the home of her relatives. None of
them had a history of acute symptoms of typhoid, and all had been
screened for <em>S typhi</em> on arrival in Australia over ten
years previously. </p>

<p><b>CAMPYLOBACTER<br>
</b>Annual numbers of campylobacter notifications continue to
increase. During 1995, 1504 notifications were made , making it
the most frequently notified infection in Western Australia. This
number represented an increase in reports of just under fifty
percent compared to 1994. </p>
<p>There was an increase in cases throughout metropolitan Perth
in the latter half of the year (Figure 3), evenly distributed
between the three metropolitan regions. </p>
<p>One quarter of all cases were among children under the age of
five (Figure 4). </p>

<p><b>CHLAMYDIA<br>
</b>Genital chlamydia infection became a notifiable infectious
disease in Western Australia in February 1993. Since that time
the annual number of notifications have steadily increased. In
1995, 1019 reports were made, with a male: female ratio of 1:2.
The lower male:female ratio for chlamydia compared to gonorrhoea
may partially reflect screening practices for chlamydia. Other
factors, such as male to male transmission of gonorrhoea are also
important in this differing ratio. </p>
<p>Notifications by month over 1994 and 1995 show a general
increase in numbers, without any seasonal variation (Figure 5). </p>
<p>Just under 80% of all cases were between the age of 15 and 29,
with half of these between 20 and 24 (Figure 6). </p>

<p><b>GONORRHOEA<br>
</b>More gonorrhoea was notified in Western Australia in 1995
than in any year since 1987. Among the 1040 cases, 670 were male
and 361 female. The highest notification rate was among the 20-24
year age group. The number of notifications made in each region,
by month of notification is shown in Table 6. </p>
<p>The highest rates of infection were in the Kimberley and
Pilbara respectively. The infection rate in the Kimberley was
2,221/100,000 population, contrasting with 15/100,000 in the
metropolitan region. </p>
<p>The Kimberley data were supplemented this year with laboratory
data in addition to the usual doctor notifications, contributing
to a 25% increase in cases reported in 1995 compared to 1994. </p>
<p>Gonorrhoea in metropolitan Perth in 1995, 177 cases, doubled
from 1994 when 77 cases were reported. This increase was seen
throughout the entire year, and throughout all metropolitan
regions. There was a greater increase in cases in the South
Metropolitan region than North or East metropolitan regions.
Figure 7 shows metropolitan notifications of gonorrhoea by month
of notification in 1994 and 1995. </p>
<p>There has been an increase in the proportion of notifications
compared with laboratory notifications indicating that education
programs conducted during 1995 may have increased awareness of
this condition and the value of notification and thus contact
tracing. </p>

Population rates of infection varied from 37/100,000 in the
Kimberley region to over 80/100,000 in the South West and Great
Southern regions, both marginally higher than the metropolitan
rate (77/100,000). </p>

</b>Similar numbers of legionellosis cases have been notified to
the Health Department of Western Australia each year over the
past five years. in 1995, 23 cases were notified, comprising 16
males and seven females. Fourteen were known to be <em>L
longbeachae</em>, and one was <em>L pneumophila</em>. The age of
cases ranged from 15 and 82, and over half were in their sixties
or older. Cases were identified in all regions except the
Kimberley and Great Southern. No association was found between
individual cases. </p>
<p><b>MEASLES<br>
</b>The number of measles cases halved in 1995 in comparison to
1994. Fifty eight cases were notified in 1995, of which 26 were
confirmed on serology. Although 20 cases were diagnosed in
children under the age of five, only four were serologically
confirmed. The sex distribution across age groups was even,
except for boys in their late teens, where a higher incidence was
reported (Figure 9). </p>
<p>There was little variation in reported cases by month.
Aboriginality was poorly reported (62%). Where it was known among
four individuals, only two were from the same community. </p>

received. The sex distribution was equal with 19 reports among
females and 22 among males. While the age of cases ranged from
three months to 80 years, half of the cases were aged four years
or under. </p>
<p><b>PERTUSSIS<br>
</b>The high notification rates for pertussis seen during 1994
continued during the first quarter of 1995, but steadily declined
since (Figure 10). The highest rates were seen in the South West
(83/100,000), Great Southern (64/100,000) and Goldfields
(59/100,000). While the epidemic affected the southern part of
the state early in the year, the Goldfields were affected after
March, with most cases notified in September. Table 7. </p>
<p>There was a fairly equal distribution between sexes; the male:
female ratio was 1:1.3. </p>
<p>Sixty percent of cases were aged 14 or under, and most adult
cases were under 45 (Figure 10). However, cases were notified
into their eighties. </p>

<p><b>RUBELLA<br>
</b>Fewer cases of rubella were notified in 1995 than the
previous year, numbers almost halving to 402 in 1995, compared to
715 in 1994. The infection first became notifiable in Western
Australia in 1993, and in that year 474 cases were notified. No
cases of congenital rubella have been reported in Western
Australia since 1993. </p>
<p>In 1995, twice as many males were notified as females
(269:130). Forty one women were of child bearing age, ie between
15-44. The age group most represented for male cases was 15-19
(Figure 11). It is likely that these teenage male cases missed
out on the now recommended MMR vaccination at age 11-14 for both
girls and boys. </p>
<p>There was an increase in cases in the metropolitan area
between August and November. The high numbers of cases in the
1994 outbreak in the South West decreased at the beginning of
1995 (Table 8). </p>

<p><b>SYPHILIS<br>
</b>One hundred and thirty two cases of syphilis were reported
during 1995, 28 more than during the preceding year. The sex
distribution was equal. Among the 1995 cases, 110 (83%) were
classified as early syphilis (primary, secondary or early
latent). An additional 21 cases were reported as late latent, and
one case as tertiary syphilis. There were no reports of
congenital syphilis. </p>
<p>Primary syphilis was diagnosed among 96 cases, and among
these, 26 (27%) were under the age of 20. </p>
<p>The highest rates of early syphilis were in the Kimberley
(243/100,000), Pilbara (33/100,000) and Goldfields (30/100,000),
which compares with the much lower rate of in the metropolitan
areas. Only seven cases of early syphilis were diagnosed in the
metropolitan region (0.6/100,000 population) and 19 further cases
were diagnosed as late latent syphilis in this area. </p>
<p>No cases of syphilis were diagnosed either in the South West
or the Great Southern Regions. </p>
<p><b>TUBERCULOSIS<br>
</b>Reports of tuberculosis were equally distributed among males
(41 cases) and females (42 cases). Ages of cases ranged from
three to eighty seven years. </p>
<p>Race was reported for 51 (60%) cases, and among these, 24 were
Caucasian, ten were Asian and three were Aboriginal. Thirteen
cases were reported as having &#147;other&#148; racial origins.
Most cases came from the metropolitan area (63) and the remaining
cases were distributed throughout each of the other regions. </p>
<p><b>HIV </b><a href="#FOOTNOTE_2"><sup><b>2</b></sup><b><br>
</b></a>The 74 newly notified cases of HIV in 1995 brought the
total number of cases of HIV infection in Western Australia to
952. Last year, fifty eight cases were male and 15 female. The
1995 data show a slight increase in cases from 1994 when 53 males
and 13 females were notified. </p>
<p>Two thirds of the male cases (38) included homosexual contact
as a risk factor, showing a declining prevalence in this risk
over time. Before 1988, over 90% of male cases in Western
Australia included homosexual contact as a risk factor (Table 9). </p>
<p>The newly notified cases in 1995 ranged from 18 to 54 years,
with an average age of 34. The average age of heterosexual cases
in 1995 was 35 for men and 28 for women. </p>
<p>Heterosexual exposure for both men and women continues to
increase in importance as a risk factor for HIV. Between
1983-1992 a total of 28 heterosexual men had been notified to our
database. Since 1993 however, 35 more men in this risk category
have been reported, showing a recent rapid increase. </p>
<p>Among the fifteen heterosexual men notified during 1995, eight
were from a country where there is a known high HIV risk eg
Africa, Thailand. Risk exposure was not determined for three
other cases. Ages of the heterosexual men ranged from 21 to 49. </p>
<p>The proportion of women affected by HIV has been increasing
since 1992. Women represented one fifth of all notifications in
1995. Among these 15 women, 12 were heterosexual and seven of
whom were from high risk countries. The age of these women ranged
from 18 to 40. </p>
<p>In either sex, the number of injecting drug users remained
low, with five male cases, an additional three male cases who
were also homosexual, and two females reported. </p>
<p><b>AIDS**<br>
</b>The number of cases of AIDS notified in 1995 was 26, (23
males and 3 females) 19 cases were among males reporting
homosexual or bisexual contact. </p>
<p>A peak in the annual number of AIDS cases in WA occurred in
1991, and the trend since then has been a decline (Figure 10).
Deaths related to AIDS have decreased slightly since 1992, 23
people were reported to have died from the condition in 1995. All
deaths except one were among males. </p>

<h3><a name="Editorial">Editorial</a></h3>
<p>The epidemiological information superhighway at times, seems
to reach grand prix equivalent speeds. How can we as health
practitioners, keep up with the increasing demands on us for
providing information to others, whilst at the same time keeping
ourselves up to date with the everchanging trends in health? New
surveillance systems and demands for data and information seem
never ending! In this edition of the <i>Bulletin</i> the various
surveillance systems operating in WA are defined and explained
for you. It is important to realise that the information supplied
by individual health practitioners is fed into an organised
system of regional Public Health Units, State Communicable
Diseases Control Program surveillance systems, the Commonwealth
national surveillance system and then regional and global
surveillance systems coordinated by the World Health
Organisation. </p>
<p>All of this data collection serves the purpose of better
informing individuals, states and nations about rapidly changing
trends in health. It also assists us to prevent infections and
control disease outbreaks. Which countries have malaria, typhoid,
cholera? Where in the world is HIV emerging as the global
pandemic shifts and moves? How well do we immunise our children
in Australia? Why has there been an epidemic of pertussis in
recent years? How can we prevent the transmission of hepatitis C
occupationally? What patterns of antibiotic resistance are in our
area thus rendering our favourite and traditional prescribing
patterns obsolete? All of these questions and many others can
only be answered by the careful analysis of reliably collected
and valid information. So, please, help us to improve the quality
of information that is collected in WA. In this way, the
epidemiology group in Communicable Diseases Control Program can
improve our data and subsequent advice to health practitioners,
improve health service planning and finally, provide the best
health care delivery to the community. </p>
<p>The <i>Bulletin</i> editorial team is keen to improve the
quality and timeliness of epidemiological information back to
you, the reader. In order to assist us to assist you, this
edition of the <i>Bulletin </i>contains a brief reader survey.
Please take a few minutes to tell us what <b>you</b> want from
us. We shall do our best to provide an improved two way street
along this busy information superhighway! </p>
<p>This edition has a focus on immunisation issues - an article
about the importance of the new pertussis vaccines, information
about how to report an adverse reaction and a reminder about the
arrival of the influenza season again. We must continue to
improve immunisation coverage in WA. As the recent pertussis
epidemic wanes, we should reflect on how quickly vaccine
preventable childhood diseases can be reintroduced into our still
vulnerable communities. </p>

<h3><a name="Epidem">EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS USED IN
WESTERN AUSTRALIA</a></h3>
<p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
<p>Disease surveillance systems are necessary to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>detect changes in disease incidence; </li>
    <li>monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of control
        programs; </li>
    <li>identify and monitor emerging diseases in WA; and </li>
    <li>identify risk areas and geographic areas of need. </li>
</ul>
<p>In WA, the major source of information is medical practitioner
notifications. It is critically important that doctors understand
their statutory obligations to report the gazetted notifiable
infections. Regional Public Health Units (PHUs) and the
Communicable Diseases Control Program (CDCP) in the metropolitan
area will assist doctors as much as possible to fulfil their
reporting requirements. Doctors may fax, phone or post (in
prepaid envelopes) notifications to regional Public Health Units
or Communicable Diseases Control Program in Perth. </p>
<p><b>CURRENT WA SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS</b> </p>
<p><b>WA Notifiable Diseases Surveillance<br>
</b>This database is the major source of timely information about
the epidemiology of infectious disease in WA. Data are collected
from medical notifications and entered at regional PHU level or
at CDCP for metropolitan notifications. This information is
merged weekly to get a statewide picture. The statewide summary
data is then electronically forwarded to the Commonwealth on a
weekly basis and contributes to the national <i>Communicable
Diseases Intelligence. </i>Contact Jag Atrie or John Markovich at
CDCP (Tel: 388 4999) for more information. </p>
<p><b>HIV/AIDS Surveillance<br>
</b>State surveillance for HIV/AIDS is coordinated by Dorothy
Jones at CDCP in Perth. All diagnoses of HIV, AIDS and HIV/AIDS
related deaths should be notified. WA, with all other states,
territories and the Commonwealth contribute to the national
surveillance of HIV disease. This national surveillance is
coordinated by the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and
Clinical Research, based in Sydney. The National Centre publishes
quarterly reports on the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS infection in
Australia. Contact the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and
Clinical Research, 376 Victoria Street, Darlinghurst, NSW, 2010.
Tel (02) 332 4648 Fax (02) 332 1837. </p>
<p><b>Surveillance of Serious Adverse Events Following
Vaccination</b> <br>
All serious adverse events following vaccination should be
notified to Dr Tony Watson at the Central Immunisation Clinic in
Rheola Street,<b> </b>Perth. Tel (09) 321 1312 Fax (09) 322 5955
Forms are available from Tony. These reports are then forwarded
to Canberra and are reported on<b> </b>annually. See article in
this <em>Bulletin</em>.</p>
<p><b>Measles Surveillance<br>
</b>If a case of measles is notified, then supplementary
information on the case should be sought. A standardised case
report form, available from CDCP should be completed and
maintained in the regional Public Health Units. In the
metropolitan area, measles notifications are followed up by Megan
Scully at CDCP for inclusion on the state register. Measles
continues to be diagnosed in susceptible children in WA. It is a
serious disease and the Measles Protocol for WA should be
followed if an outbreak is confirmed. One case now constitutes an
outbreak. Further information can be obtained from the regional
PHU or Megan Scully at CDCP. </p>
<p><b>Tuberculosis Surveillance</b> <br>
All tuberculosis notifications should be forwarded to CDCP or the
regional PHU. The Chest Clinic is then informed in order to
maintain the state database. Dr SC Pang at the Chest Clinic also
keeps a watching brief on atypical mycobacterial infections
diagnosed in WA and is keen to hear of these reports. </p>
<p><b>Laboratory based surveillance<br>
</b>There are two current laboratory based surveillance systems
active in WA, firstly, the gonococcal surveillance system (see
report page 8 of this <i>Bulletin</i>) and secondly the hepatitis
C supplementary data system. The hepatitis C supplementary data
collection system was described in the <i>WA</i> <i>Communicable
Diseases</i> <i>Bulletin</i> Vol 6 No 1, 1996. </p>

<h3><a name="Creutz">CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE AND BOVINE
SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY</a></h3>
<p>There has been considerable media and medical journal coverage
about the recent BSE outbreak in the UK, and the possible
association with the development of CJD in humans. </p>
<p>The Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services has
recently produced a series of information sheets about CJD and
BSE which are reproduced in this bulletin. </p>
<p><b>CJD/BSE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</b> </p>
<p><b>What is Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD)?<br>
</b>CJD is a rare brain disease which results in death after a
relatively rapid course of dementia, impaired mobility and loss
of speech. CJD occurs with an incidence of approximately one case
per million population per year in every country in the world
where records are kept, including in the UK. Most cases of CJD
occur after the age of 60. CJD is generally believed to be caused
by an infectious agent known as a prion, or `infectious protein'.
A prion is neither a bacteria nor a virus. </p>
<p><b>What are the links between BSE and CJD?<br>
</b>There is no scientific evidence that supports a casual link
between BSE in beef and CJD in humans. However, the British
Government have recently identified 10 cases of CJD that had a
number of unusual features. For these 10 cases it has not been
possible to exclude exposure to BSE as a cause of the illness.
However, it is important to note that the rate of CJD in the UK
has remained the same as that from other countries at
approximately one case per million population per year. </p>
<p><b>What are the symptoms of CJD?<br>
</b>CJD affects the central nervous system and may have a number
of clinical presentations. These may include dementia, impaired
mobility and speech, and sometimes, involuntary jerking of the
limbs. These symptoms rapidly become worse. As with any health
problem, if you are concerned you should see your doctor. </p>
<p><b>Is there a test for CJD?<br>
</b>There is no test for CJD. Most diagnoses are made on clinical
evidence. The rapidly progressing nature of the disease is a key
feature. </p>
<p><b>What treatment is available for CJD?<br>
</b>There is no known treatment or cure for CJD. </p>
<p><b>I have travelled to the UK in the last 10 years - am I at
risk from CJD?<br>
</b>It is not possible to give an absolute reassurance, but the
risk would appear to be very low. </p>

<p><b>ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING IMMUNISATION</b> </p>
<p>One of the important surveillance systems operating in
Australia is the monitoring of adverse events following
immunisation. One of the difficulties with this system, is that
adverse events are infrequently seen by health workers or
practitioners involved in the administration of immunisations.
This system is designed to detect adverse events <b>other </b>than
local reactions! If you have any queries about adverse events,
please contact Tony Watson, Tel (09) 321 1312. </p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>1996 IMMUNISATION CAMPAIGN<br>
</strong></font>by Colin Tyler, Campaign Coordinator, CDCP </p>
<p>The 1996 WA Immunisation Campaign focused particularly on
children aged 1 to 2 years. The campaign was launched on 1 May.
It was led by TV advertising using a 30 second whooping cough
advertisement, `Baby Blue', that was run in 1995. The campaign
also used newsprint advertising and brochure distribution. The
media component ran until 24 May. </p>
<p>Special immunisation clinics and educational displays were
conducted in conjunction with some regional health services and
local councils during May. These activities were generally
located in shopping centres on Thursday nights or Saturday
mornings. </p>
<p>We know from experience that campaigns such as this produce a
surge in demand for immunisations. Our aim for the medium term is
to help build strategies for systematic immunisation so that the
enthusiasm that media can generate will be consolidated. </p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Current"><font size="4"><strong>CURRENT IMMUNISATION
ISSUES<br>
</strong></font></a>By Dr Tony Watson, SMO, Immunisation Clinic </p>
<p><b>Hepatitis A<br>
</b>Double strength hepatitis A vaccine will be available in the
next few months. It is designed to replace the first two doses of
the current three dose schedule (at 0, 1 and 12 months), and will
give about 95% protection for the first year at a reduced cost. </p>
<p><b>The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register<br>
</b>As of 26 April 1996, 1,219 (94%) of the 1,233 Western
Australian General Practitioners enrolled on the ACIR, have
reported immunisation records to the Health Insurance
Commission's immunisation database. All GPs are encouraged to
report their patient's vaccination records to the Register.
Information about vaccine coverage will be published in future <i>Bulletins</i>. </p>
<p><b>Pre-school DTP boosters<br>
</b>Several Community Nurses have reported that children they
have referred to General Practitioners for the scheduled 4 - 5
year old pre-school DTP booster have been told they should not
have this vaccination until they are 5 years old. </p>
<p>The 4&#150;5 year old pre-school DTP booster is recommended
for children prior to commencing group classes, when the risk of
pertussis transmission increases. Accordingly, DTP immunisation
should precede this event, even if the child has not reached 5
years of age. </p>
<p><b>Influenza<br>
</b>The Influenza season is upon us. The 1996 Australian
formulation contains an A/Texas/36/91 like strain, an
A/Johannesburg/33/94 like strain and a B/Beijing/184/93 like
strain. Not all the available influenza vaccines have the same
formulation of strains, but they are antigenically equivalent and
will provide similar protection. The influenza vaccine provides
up to 80 per cent protection for the recipient. Influenza
vaccination should be repeated annually to ensure that those at
risk are protected from the strains which are most likely to
affect the southern hemisphere each winter. </p>

<p><a name="MMR"><font size="4"><strong>MMR SECOND DOSE IN
SCHOOLS WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br>
</strong></font></a>by Jag Gill, Jag Atrie and Clive Mulroy, CDCP </p>
<p>Since 1993, Western Australia has embarked on a second dose
Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccination for children aged 11 to
14 years. The original rubella vaccination for girls, only
targeted children in Year 8 (first year of high school) in the
southern regions of the State. The northern regions, especially
the Kimberley and Pilbara, have for many years immunised children
in Year 6 because of the higher incidence of teenage pregnancy in
the region. In the recent past, with the introduction of MMR for
both boys and girls, many country regions have chosen to
administer vaccines in schools in Year 7 (last year of primary
school). The results for MMR coverage, (see Table 1) clearly show
that the country areas do well irrespective of the year of
administration, but the metropolitan area and Goldfields region
do not do as well. This may be because they target Year 8
students in high school. </p>
<p>Although there is a need for uniformity across the State to
ensure that no child misses out on the possibility of being
vaccinated, the early administration of vaccine in the Kimberley
and Pilbara appears justified. In the other regions however,
consistent immunisation at the same year, ie Year 7, is probably
the best alternative and should be promoted. </p>
<p><b>Acknowledgment<br>
</b>The authors thank all of the regional Public Health Units and
the Central Immunisation Clinic for supplying the immunisation
coverage data. </p>

VACCINES - THE AUSTRALIAN STORY<br>
</strong></font></a>by Carol Cheney and Tony Watson </p>
<p>In Australia, an acellular pertussis vaccine will be available
through private prescription in September 1996.<sup>1</sup> The
acellular vaccines appear to be efficacious and have fewer side
effects than the whole-cell vaccine. Whole-cell vaccination,
however, remains a vital strategy in the prevention of this
potentially fatal condition. </p>
<p><b>PERTUSSIS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br>
</b>In the period 1990/91 to 1994/95 there were 481 cases of
whooping cough in children aged 0-5 years, notified to the HDWA.
This included 229 episodes of hospitalisation, each for an
average of 8.4 days. <sup>2</sup> Table 2 shows the number of
cases of pertussis notified to the HDWA from 1986 - 1995. Around
one in every 200 children under 6 months who is infected with
pertussis will die. </p>
<p><b>CURRENT PERTUSSIS VACCINATION AND SIDE EFFECTS<br>
</b>In Australia, whole-cell vaccination for pertussis is
incorporated with diphtheria and tetanus. This triple antigen
(DTP) vaccine is given at two, four, six, eighteen months and 4-5
years. </p>
<p>Australian studies show that systemic and local minor adverse
effects following DTP vaccination are relatively common.<sup>3,4</sup>
A recent study, conducted in Melbourne, observed side effects
among 531 infants after the 2 month dose of DTP.<sup>3</sup> The
most common side effects observed were:</p>

</table>
<p>Serious adverse effects are extremely rare. The rate of
anaphylaxis is estimated at about 1 in 50,000 doses and of acute
encephalopathy at 0-10.5 cases per million vaccinations.<sup>5</sup>
The rate of CNS complications in US children notified with
pertussis infection was relatively high with convulsions in 1.9
percent, encephalopathy in 0.3 percent and death in 0.5 percent.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p><b>ACELLULAR VACCINES</b><br>
Studies of acellular vaccines have been conducted in several
countries. These studies show evidence of efficacy and indicate
that there are fewer side effects than whole-cell pertussis
vaccines. Rates of serious adverse effects are not yet known.<sup>5</sup> </p>
<p><b>CURRENT PRACTICE GUIDELINES</b><br>
Practitioners are encouraged to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>continue to vaccinate using whole-cell DTP; </li>
    <li>advise parents that minor adverse effects of whole-cell
        DTP are relatively common; </li>
    <li>instruct parents in the management of minor adverse side
        effects; </li>
    <li>discourage deferral of DTP immunisation unless
        contra-indicated; and </li>
    <li>consider introducing the acellular vaccine, if desired. </li>

<p><a name="Ross"><font size="4"><strong>AN UPDATE ON Ross River
Virus disease<br>
</strong></font></a>by Jag Atrie, Senior Research Officer, CDCP </p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION<br>
</b>Ross River Virus (RRV) is an alphavirus, formerly known as a
&#147;group A arbovirus&#148;, belonging to the family
Togaviridae. It produces epidemic disease characterised by fever,
rash and arthropathy. In some cases, joint symptoms are
especially intense and may be prolonged. The mosquito <i>Aedes
camptorhynchus</i> is considered to be the principal vector in
Western Australia. Other major vectors are <i>Aedes vigilax</i>
and <i>Culex annulirostris</i>. Virus has also been isolated from
various other species of mosquitoes.</p>
<p><b>EPIDEMIOLOGY IN WA<br>
</b>By April this year 1,288 RRV (609 females and 679 males)
cases were notified by doctors in Western Australia with a peak
in February (485) and March (464). This years epidemic had more
than twice as many notifications than 1989 and 1992 (see figure
1). Most cases were aged between 30 and 50 years. The disease
epidemiology follows a three year cycle with epidemics occurring
when the herd immunity in the reservoir host is low. The report
by Lindsay <i>et al</i><sup>1</sup> suggests that various factors
were in favour of this years outbreak. Environmental conditions
such as high rainfall and temperature favoured very high
densities of <i>Aedes camptorhynchus</i>. This coupled with
increased outdoor human activity during the Christmas break in
the Southwest resulted in greater man-vector contact creating a
potential for high levels of virus transmission. </p>
<p><b>PREVENTION<br>
</b>Prevention of RRV disease depends on control of vector
mosquito populations. This can be achieved by either reducing the
adult population using adulticides or by controlling the mosquito
larvae using larvicides. Use of adulticides or larvicides, at
times when entomological monitoring suggests higher than usual
mosquito population densities, will result in effectively
reducing the spill-over to humans. Until a promising human
vaccine is in sight, personal protection is by far the most
effective method of preventing the disease. The following
measures will reduce man-vector contact and greatly reduce the
risk of catching the disease: </p>
<ol>
    <li>using insect repellents (containing 5-20% DEET) on the
        exposed parts of the body at regular intervals; </li>
    <li>outdoor campers should use bednets impregnated with a
        synthetic pyrethroid while those who rest indoors should
        ensure that their residences have adequate fly-screens; </li>
    <li>while outdoors wear loose fitting garments covering limbs
        and trunk; </li>
    <li>reduce outdoor activity during mosquitoes peak biting
        period; and </li>
    <li>prevent mosquitoes from breeding in close proximity to
        one's home. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?<br>
</b>Further studies on the ecology, biology, behaviour and
genetic mapping of individual vector species and mammalian host
serological investigations will improve our understanding of the
disease. This will assist the development of a more effective
mosquito control strategy. </p>

<h3>USING AZITHROMYCIN IN YOUR REGION? THEN, READ ON.......... </h3>
<p><a name="Azith"><font size="4"><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
AZITHROMYCIN USAGE IN WA<br>
</strong></font></a>In February 1996, an Operational Instruction
(OP 0695/96) was issued by the Commissioner of Health. All health
practitioners are reminded to think carefully about antibiotic
prescribing patterns and the development of drug resistance by
micro-organisms. Azithromycin is a new antibiotic of the
macrolide class which is closely related to erythromycin. It has
a wide spectrum of activity and has the advantage of oral
administration with less gastrointestinal side effects and a long
half life. This long half life results in excellent tissue
penetration and makes it suitable for short course therapy as
well as ensuring compliance. There are concerns that this ease of
administration may result in inappropriate use of this antibiotic
and the emergence of resistant organisms. Therefore, health
practitioners are encouraged to comply with the following
indications for Azithromycin: </p>

<p><a name="EpiCom"><font size="4"><strong>EPIDEMIOLOGICAL
COMMENTS<br>
</strong></font></a><b>Data reported from weeks 1 to week 16,
1996.</b> </p>
<p><b>Please note all published data are provisional and subject
to revision</b> </p>
<p>A total of 4,485 notifications have been reported in WA from
1/1/96 to 21/4/96. There were 2,911 notifications from the
metropolitan region. Of the country regions, notifications were
greatest from the Kimberley area with 611 in the reporting time
frame. In WA, all regional notifications are sent to the local
Public Health Unit and then forwarded by disk or electronically
to the Epidemiology Group in the Communicable Diseases Control
Program. Currently, all metropolitan notifications are sent to
CDCP. It is important to note that all parts of the notification
form should be completed, particularly, date of birth, sex,
postcode and race. This information then allows accurate analysis
of collected data. Data are forwarded from the State to the
Commonwealth on a weekly basis. </p>
<p>The major trends seen are the continuing Ross River Virus
epidemic with 1,263 notifications, the continuing high
notification rates of <i>Campylobacter</i> and the increased
number of chlamydia notifications since the introduction of
urinary PCR testing in WA. Hepatitis A and B notifications have
decreased compared to the same reporting period in 1995. </p>
<p><b>ROSS RIVER VIRUS<br>
</b>Due to the combination of December 1995 rain and warm
conditions in the southwest of WA, ideal conditions have
prevailed for the breeding of mosquitos and transmission of Ross
River Virus infection. A total of 1,263 notifications has been
received to date. Many individuals from around WA who travelled
to the southwest over the Christmas and school holiday break were
exposed to mosquito bites. Consistent and frequent advice to all
West Australians about avoiding exposure to mosquito bites needs
to be given. (see article in this edition, p 7). In the northern
areas of the state this advice is also necessary at times when
Australian Encephalitis (Murray Valley Encephalitis) activity is
present. Of interest, Japanese Encephalitis has recently been
diagnosed in the Torres Strait Islands and a major disease
control program including mass vaccination of island residents
and the establishment of a sentinel pig surveillance program has
begun. To date there has been no JE activity noted in mainland
Australia. </p>
<p><b>HAEMOLYTIC URAEMIC SYNDROME<br>
</b>There has been one case of HUS reported in WA this year. A 5
year old child from a southern town developed symptoms consistent
with HUS after a holiday break. During this time a number of food
outlets were attended. When uraemia developed the child was
admitted to PMH and has since recovered. In this case, no
causative organism was isolated and there have been no other
cases reported. A complete investigation of all food outlets
attended by the index case in Perth was carried out and no
further problems were identified. </p>
<p>HUS is a notifiable condition in WA and the case definition
states that HUS should be reported if an individual demonstrates; </p>

<p>Public health outbreak management should be instituted in
order to determine if there is a point source for the outbreak.
In Australia, the organism responsible for the SA outbreak was <i>E.
coli</i> O111, an enterohaemorrhagic organism which releases a
Shiga like toxin. If HUS is clinically suspected then this should
be clearly indicated on the laboratory request form so that a
laboratory search for the appropriate organism can be made. There
is currently no screening test available for <i>E. coli</i> O111
in Perth and so a specific request to look for enterohaemorrhagic <i>E.
coli</i> should be made to the laboratory service. </p>
<p><b>OVERSEAS NOTES<br>
</b>Reports in the West Australian, 15/5/96, indicated that there
were a larger than usual number of cholera cases presenting in
Penang, Malaysia. CDCP has received a number of enquiries
regarding travel to this area. As with all travel to countries
where enteric disease is common, travellers should be advised to
only drink bottled or chlorinated water and to eat food which is
freshly prepared or can be peeled by the traveller. Fresh salads
should be avoided. If travellers become unwell, early medical
advice should be sought. </p>
<p>Cholera vaccination is no longer an entry requirement to
Australia or cholera endemic areas. Vaccination against cholera
is not currently recommended due to its low efficacy and short
duration of action. </p>

<p><font size="4"><b>CONFERENCE REPORT - ASID MEETING, BROOME,
APRIL 1996<br>
</b></font>by Dr Dorothy Jones, CDCP </p>
<p><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERTS GATHER IN BROOME<br>
</b>Just after Anzac Day would have been an ideal time to
introduce an exotic infectious disease into sunny Broome in WA!
Nearly all the Infectious Disease and Public Health Physicians
from WA were in attendance at a conference about infections
around the Indian Ocean area. Organised by the Australasian
Society for Infectious Diseases Inc and billed as their Annual
Scientific Meeting, this conference brought together a broad
cross section of people interested in the laboratory, research,
clinical and public health issues of infectious disease. </p>
<p>The program was well organised and extremely well attended and
included a session on Aboriginal health issues and infectious
disease in the northwest of WA. Personal highlights for me were
the opportunities to hear a cross section of views from
international and national experts on issues such as HIV,
toxoplasmosis, TB and which antibiotic to use for community
acquired infections. It was reassuring to see that the Australian
antibiotic guideline recommendations were a robust and reliable
tool to assist busy practitioners in choosing appropriate
antibiotic regimens. The issue of antibiotic resistance was
repeatedly raised at this meeting and a fascinating paper was
presented which looked at the difference between clinical
response to drugs and the laboratory definition of resistance
according to MIC. </p>
<p><b>SOUTH AFRICAN EXPERT CHALLENGES THE NOTION OF
&#147;RESISTANCE&#148;<br>
</b>Professor Keith Klugman from the Pneumococcal Diseases
Research Unit in Johannesburg, South Africa presented a symposium
examining the relevance of antibiotic resistance (as defined in
the laboratory) to the clinical management of pneumonia. His
provocative address asked whether in vitro resistance as defined
by MIC is clinically relevant in the treatment of pneumonia where
the crucial issue is what level of drug is achievable at the site
of infection. Prof Klugman emphasised that his discussion was
only relevant to pneumonia and not meningitis where any
demonstrated in vitro resistance is disastrous. In meningitis,
the organism must be sensitive to the antimicrobial used. His
conclusion was that new clinical &#147;breakpoints&#148; will
need to be developed for the management of pneumonia and that
despite the demonstration of in vitro resistance that B-lactam
drugs may continue to be the empiric drugs of choice for
pneumonia. Of interest, Keith Klugman also discussed the
increasing emergence of pneumococcal macrolide resistance and the
global spread of the multiply resistant pneumococcus, 23F. He
stated that there is no role for the use of quinolones in the
treatment of pneumonia. </p>
<p><b>GET RID OF THAT CAT!<br>
</b>Professor Jack Remington from the Stanford University School
of Medicine presented two papers on toxoplasmosis; one paper
addressed the issues of congenital toxoplasmosis and the other
looked at toxoplasmosis in the immunocompromised patient. <i>Toxoplasma
gondii</i> is among the most common causes of latent infection of
humans throughout the world. Frequently acquired from association
with felines, this chronic latent infection is associated with
cysts in multiple organs. Immunologically competent individuals
with acute acquired Toxoplasma infection usually have a self
limited course and do not require specific treatment. However in
the immunocompromised patient latent infection reactivates and
cysts redevelop. Clinical syndromes associated with Toxoplasmosis
in immunocompromised patients are most frequently encephalitis,
myocarditis and pneumonitis. As far as congenital toxoplasmosis
is concerned, congenital transmission of <i>T. gondii </i>puts
the infected foetus at risk of suffering severe damage to
multiple organs, especially the CNS and the eye. Professor
Remington stressed the importance of early diagnosis in pregnancy
and with the availability of Spiromycin treatment, the incidence
of congenital toxoplasmosis can be reduced by 60% if the woman is
treated in pregnancy. Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of a
positive IgM result. However the IgM can remain positive for many
months and so caution in interpreting this test as indicative of
recently acquired infection is recommended. PCR techniques on
amniotic fluid are now available to assist in the diagnosis of
foetal infection. </p>
<p>As with so many of these issues in public health and
infectious disease, the most important issue for patients is to
prevent the acquisition of disease! Professor Remington stressed
that all pregnant women should be advised of the risks of
acquiring toxoplasmosis and should be careful in the daily care
of domestic cats, especially kittens. This advice is also
recommended for immunocompromised patients. </p>
<p><b>IS IT WORTH GOING TO NEXT YEAR?<br>
</b>Overall, this scientific meeting which focussed on Indian
Ocean Infections was interesting, broad ranging and friendly. I
can recommend the ASID scientific meeting to those with a general
interest in infectious disease wishing to keep abreast of the
latest developments in immunology, molecular research and public
health. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>HEALTH EDUCATION OFFICERS NEWS</b></font><b><br>
</b>by Lisa Haunold, Senior Project Officer, CDCP </p>
<p>Earlier this year CDCP contacted all Public Health Units and
Health Authorities to offer support and assistance with regional
education and prevention initiatives. The response was positive
with an interest in support and assistance for initiatives
ranging from policy development to staff training, as well as
being updated with information on campaigns, projects and funding
opportunities that arise. </p>
<p>As a result, a two day inservice was held on the 16 and 17 May
primarily for Health Promotion Officers involved in education and
prevention initiatives. The inservice was well attended by Public
Health Unit and health authority representatives from around the
State. </p>
<p>If you are interested in support and assistance for education
and prevention initiatives as outlined above please do not
hesitate to call Lisa Haunold, Senior Project Officer, CDCP on
(09) 388 4859. </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES NEWS<br>
</b></font>by Megan Scully, Advanced Community Nurse, CDCP </p>
<p>The issue of a nurses support network for rural nurses was
discussed at the ACN meeting held in April in Perth. The ACNs
acknowledged that there is a continual change of staff working in
rural areas, therefore, there is a need by new staff for ongoing
support and assistance with accessing information pertinent to
community nursing practice. Many nurses have already identified a
key person in the metropolitan area to telephone to discuss areas
of clinical practice. It was agreed, at this meeting, that each
ACN would be available for networking within a specified rural
area in WA to offer a &#147;buddy&#148; system of support
therefore improving the network link between metropolitan and
rural nurses. </p>
<p>This assistance is also available to all Public Health Nurses.
Please feel free to contact any of the nurses at CDCP to assist
with accessing resources at the regional level. For further
information, please contact Megan Scully Tel: (09) 388 4845 </p>

</b></font>by Carol Cheney, Editor </p>
<p>You may have noted the change in paper used to print the <i>Bulletin</i>.
The new paper is 100% recycled. The editors decision to change to
a new paper was prompted by two issues. </p>
<p>Firstly, we wished to establish a distinctive appearance for
the <i>Bulletin</i> which enabled it to be easily recognised
among the large quantity of material received by many of our
readers. Secondly, our aim was to produce a publication which
minimised impact on the environment. The importance of this
second aim was reinforced by the concern expressed by the readers
of another government publication, the <i>Intersector.</i> The
use of recycled paper was the most frequent concern raised by
readers of this publication. </p>
<p>In selecting a recycled paper it has been vital to ensure that
the <i>Bulletin</i> continues to be easy to read and photocopy. </p>
