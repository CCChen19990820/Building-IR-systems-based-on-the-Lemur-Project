    <blockquote>
        <p>Children and sex are inextricably linked in the conservative
        imagination. They are the lure and the fear, the bait and
        the trap, a measure of how far decent social behavior has
        gone down the tubes, of how a morally corrupt liberal
        social agenda has replaced God-fearing purity. Whether
        the issue is sex education, the banning of pornography,
        condom distribution in schools, or the specter of
        day-care centers overrun by ritual satanic abusers, the
        linkage of kids and sex is sure to make headlines,
        tempers boil, and, unfortunately, bad social policy. But
        there are plenty of situations where the linkage of kids
        and sex raises scarcely an eyebrow on the right or the
        left. </p>
        <p>Think of those numerous ads in the New York Times Magazine
        that feature pubescent boys and girls in scanty, sexy
        summer clothes by Calvin Klein or Gap. Think of TV soap advertising
        (particularly Ivory) that depict daddies and children
        frolicking naked in the bathtub. Or the Fruit of the Loom
        ad featuring a drop-dead hunk of a dad and his 6-year-old son
        walking hand-in-hand in their undies to take a morning leak
        together. Think about 60 years of the Coppertone ad where
        a dog is pulling a little girl's bathing suit down,
        exposing her left buttock. Kids and sex have always been
        a staple in advertising. </p>
        <p>In the past Hollywood films have been careful about children
        and sexuality. Films like Lolita and Baby Doll--both
        early 1960s--knew they were breaking taboos when they
        ventured into this territory. Films in the 1970s and
        1980s seemed more concerned with presenting children as
        instruments of evil (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The
        Omen) than as sexual, although in our culture evil and
        sexuality are undoubtedly linked. But recently kids and
        sex have reappeared in Hollywood films. The Little
        Rascals positions its grotesque children in highly sexualized,
        adult poses. Interview With The Vampire gives us a 9-year-old
        vampire girl with the sexuality of an adult. The
        Professional, in its original version, was so explicit
        about the sexual tension between a 12-year-old girl and a
        38-year-old hit-man that the more overt sexuality was
        trimmed for U. S. distribution. No doubt about it, kids and
        sexuality are becoming acceptable fare for mainstream movies. </p>
        <p>Ironically, this acceptance seems to go against the
        grain of current social policy and political thought. Look
        at a recent action by Janet Reno in a
        &quot;kiddy-porn&quot; case that is on its way to the Supreme
        Court. Several years ago, a Pennsylvania State University
        graduate student ordered video tapes through the mail containing
        images of young girls on a beach. Although clothed in bathing
        suits the girls were video-taped in a sexual manner with
        lingering shots of the (clothed) pubic region. The
        graduate student was charged with violating a 1978
        Federal child porn law which makes it a crime to receive
        or distribute pictures of minors engaged in a &quot;lascivious
        exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.&quot; The
        graduate student appealed--and lost--his argument being
        that the existing law, and its repeated interpretations,
        stipulated that the minors be nude, or at the very least
        that their genitals be visible under clothing. When Solicitor General
        Drew S. Days reviewed the Supreme Court brief for the
        administration he agreed with the defense, disagreed with
        the lower court rulings, and stuck to the traditional, narrower
        reading of the law. His decision was intended to preserve
        the child pornography law by not allowing it to be so
        broadly interpreted as to be unconstitutional. </p>
        <p>The moderate and far-right then accused the Clinton administration
        of being soft on child porn. Their campaign escalated
        until the Senate was forced to deal with the issue. All
        100 members voted for a resolution condemning the Days
        brief, stating that it did not reflect Congressional understanding
        of the scope and intent of the original 1978 law. Several
        months ago, Attorney General Janet Reno submitted a brief
        to the Supreme Court in which she endorsed the
        constitutionality of the State Appeals Court. Arguing
        that &quot;neither nudity or discernability of the genitals
        through clothing is a required element of the offense&quot;
        she added &quot;I believe that the government must argue
        for that legitimate interpretation of the statute, which prohibits
        the receipt and possession of child pornography to the
        maximum extant allowed under the Constitution.&quot; In an
        unusual action the administration's brief was submitted to
        the Court signed by Attorney General Reno, not Solicitor
        General Days. Reno added in her statement: &quot;As I am
        ultimately responsible for the positions taken by the United
        States, the brief filed today adopts the interpretation made
        by the Third Circuit, which I believe to be the correct
        one. For this reason it bears my signature rather than
        that of the Solicitor General.&quot; </p>
        <p>So what does all this mean? The law states that minors
        in child porn must engage in &quot;lascivious exhibition
        of the genitals or pubic area.&quot; Yet in this case the
        video tapes in question were of clothed children who were
        apparently unaware that they were being video-taped. The
        defining element in the &quot;obscenity&quot; here is
        based more on intent and the perception of the viewer
        rather then on the material itself. Under the new,
        broader interpretation other factors might enter into the
        evaluation of what constitutes child pornography:
        context, narrative, effect on the viewer, even differing
        cultural standards. </p>
        <p>It has always been hard to talk about kids and sex. We have
        few guidelines and even fewer cultural support systems
        that allow us to think honestly about issues of the sexuality
        of children, exploitation, responsibility, and cultural
        norms. What we do have, however, is a media and a culture
        that is obsessed with kids and sex, with representations
        of sex and innocence, with images of child sexual
        titillation, and the dangerous, taboo pleasures of sexual
        menace. </p>
        <p>The Little Rascals aims to be a satire on contemporary sexual
        and gender norms, but what stands out is the odd, preening
        sexual and gender caricatures that director Penelope
        Spheeris forces on her young performers. The boys are
        made into either little romantic fools or women-hating
        he-men; the girls are cute, sexualized flirts and
        tempters. No one would accuse The Little Rascals of being
        child pornography--not in the strict legal sense, even under
        the most broad interpretation of the law--but it is grossly
        unsettling and ugly. If Spheeris-- Wayne's World, The
        Decline of Western Civilization-- has intended to expose
        the grotesqueness of gender roles by foisting them on
        children, she has not succeeded. What we are left with is
        a bizarre, and wholly unpleasant depiction of children mimicking
        adult sexuality with neither context nor point. </p>
        <p>Neil Jordan's Interview With The Vampire is based on Anne
        Rice's imaginative and witty novel which had clear homoerotic
        overtones. Large portions could be read as an allegory of pre-Stonewall
        gay life--vampires live alone in a twilight world, when
        they do form communities they are covert and underground.
        Jordan's film (based on a screenplay by Rice) is more
        polymorphously perverse. Here the vampires exist in a
        state of semi-sexual arousal. There is a sexual
        relationship implied between Lestat (Tom Cruise) and his
        blood-sucking initiate Louis (Brad Pitt), and a
        full-blown romance between Louis and the older, wiser vampire
        Armand (Antonio Banderas). But the sexual ambiance is
        always shifting, neither completely hetero nor homo.
        Sucking blood and killing become both sexual acts and insufficient ends
        unto themselves. </p>
        <p>This is heady material and Rice and Jordan bring it together
        in the character of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a nine-year-old
        girl that Lestat turns into a vampire to help bond his
        failing relationship with Louis. Claudia becomes a
        pampered toy for Lestat--she is dressed like a doll and treated
        like a petulant child when she kills her piano teacher--and
        a daughter/lover companion for Louis. While she and Louis
        sleep together in the same coffin, a more explicit sexual
        relationship is carefully left unstated, as are the
        sexual relationships between Lestat, Louis, and Armand.
        Claudia is the love child of Lestat and Louis. More innocent
        and much crueler then either of her surrogate parents,
        she is a nightmare of childhood, a bitter realization of
        hopelessness. She is also extraordinarily sexual. In her
        turn-of-the-century white crinolines and curls, with her
        coy mannerisms, and her killer instinct, Claudia is the most
        sexual of the vampires: she is the one who uses her
        pre-pubescent sexual charms to lure her victims. Later in
        film Claudia turns on Lestat for making her what she is:
        a sexual woman trapped in a little girl's body, as well
        as the third wheel in a male homosexual relationship. Louis
        even helps her get a companion--an older women who longs
        for Claudia as both a mother and a lover--but this all
        ends badly. </p>
        <p>This is a Freudian nightmare of family romance, and Jordan's
        filming is as striking as it was in The Crying Game.But
        it is the characterization of Claudia that startles. She
        is the femme fatale projected onto girlish innocence; essential
        femininity masking death and destruction. With her
        ultra-sophisticated style Claudia could as easily be modeling
        expensive children's clothing in the New York Times
        Magazine or working as a high-priced call girl who specializes
        in the &quot;little girl look.&quot; </p>
        <p>This is the deadly girl whore who both wants and can't have
        sex, whose innocence is incitement to defilement. The
        power of this image is in sharp contrast to another character--a young
        boy who seems to be Armand's lover. While Claudia is
        presented in ravishing detail, Armand's boy-toy simply
        stands around with bite-marks on his neck, a passive
        source of blood and pleasure. Rice and Jordan are attempting
        to provoke here, but it is striking that hardly any
        critics have mentioned the highly sexualized nature of Claudia's
        character. Is she simply the acceptable screen presence
        of a cultural prototype to which we have become so accustomed
        that no comment is necessary? Or do critics and audiences
        treat horror movies as a genre with more excusable
        conventions? </p>
        <p>The Professional is a trendy, trashy French thriller
        by Luc Besson, the director of the equally trendy and junky
        1992 La Femme Nikita. The story is minimal: Leon (Jean
        Reno), an illiterate, childlike hit-man protects Mathilda
        (Natalie Portman) a 12-year-old waif whose family has
        been murdered by crazed Drug Enforcement Agency police. Besson
        presents an urban beauty and the beast tale, but as it
        progresses and the couple becomes sexually attracted to one
        another, the film changes not so much in tone as in subtext. Besson
        presents us with completely amoral worlds--in La Femme
        Nikita the nearly psychotic punk heroine becomes a
        state-sponsored assassin; in The Professional being a
        hit-man is simply another messy urban job. So a sexual
        affair between a grown man and a pre-teenage girl is no
        big deal, in this amoral world. </p>
        <p>Besson's original European cut of The Professional was far
        more explicit in its depiction of Leon and Mathilda's relationship.
        While we never actually see them engaging in sexual activity,
        they shower together and show more physical affection on
        screen. The U. S. release cut some of the more implicit sexuality
        (as well as the brutal killing of Mathilda four-year-old
        brother), but the film is still clearly about sex. What
        has not been cut from the film, and is intrinsic to it,
        is the sexual portrait of Mathilda. The Professional
        trades on two stock cultural images: the brutal killer
        with a heart of gold and the sexy girl-child. Like Claudia
        in Interview With the Vampire, Mathilda is photographed
        as a sexual icon. But while Claudia's sexuality is
        highlighted by her apparent (but surface) innocence,
        Besson films Mathilda in an overtly sexual manner.
        Dressed in faux Madonna outfits she cavorts for the camera
        like a sex goddess (even imitating Marilyn Monroe) who
        knows what she wants despite her age. </p>
        <p>We are at a point in culture and politics where
        discussions about children and sexuality are getting more and
        more difficult. While consciousness about the prevalence
        of sexual abuse has been raised, the right wing has
        captured the topic and use it to their own ends. A decade ago feminist
        anthropologist, Carol Vance, warned that the child-abuse-in-day-care-centers controversy
        was a response to feminist progress and was being
        promoted by the conservatives to put women back in the
        home as primary care givers. Charges of pedophilia have
        been used successfully against gay-rights legislation;
        the same is true for sex education and safer-sex
        programs. The fight over the Clinton's administration's
        brief about the child pornography law is another example
        of how social policy is being formed by conservative, right-wing politicians. </p>
        <p>Yet in the midst of this, it is still possible to
        eroticize children in movies like Interview With the
        Vampire and The Professional, with little comment from
        media or audiences. The solution here isn't that films
        like these should be banned under the child pornography
        law, but that our cultural anxieties about children and sexuality
        should be discussed more openly and honestly. In lieu of
        this discussion, our culture has decided that some forms
        of eroticized child sexuality are okay--such as
        advertising, Hollywood movies--while other forms--images of
        clothed children sold to people expressly interested in
        such material as a turn-on--are not. The reality is that
        there is a very thin line between what turns people on and
        to what purpose. It would be absurd to insist that the
        depictions of eroticized girls in Interview With the Vampire
        and The Professional are not intended to turn on some
        members of the audience. That is clearly the visual and
        thematic intent of these films. </p>
        <p>There are no easy answers here. Children (like all humans)
        have sexual natures and their sexuality is an intrinsic
        part of their engagement with the rest of the world. How,
        where, and with whom they may display or act on this
        sexuality is an open question and one with which adults
        have had an extremely difficult time dealing. This is not
        made any better by a government pretending that it is
        protecting children from abuse by broadening an already-shaky
        pornography law. Nor is the discussion made any clearer
        by pretending that the depictions of eroticized children
        in advertisements or Hollywood movies have nothing to do
        with adult sexuality. These are hard issues to discuss or
        even think about, but if we keep ignoring the questions
        things are just going to get worse. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><em></em></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The Bell Curve, by Richard Herrnstein and Charles
        Murray, and the publicity given to it by the mainstream
        media, is part of a new racist onslaught on the black
        poor, that, not coincidentally, has gathered steam during
        a period of austerity for ordinary citizens and pressures
        for budgetary cutbacks by the corporate community. In his
        1974 essay &quot;Racist Arguments and IQ,&quot; Stephen
        J. Gould, writing about an earlier resurgence of
        &quot;biological determinism,&quot; asked, if the new
        theory &quot;rests on no new facts (actually, no facts at
        all), then why has it become so popular of late? The
        answer must be social and political.&quot; Gould pointed
        out, further, that in a period when poverty is still
        growing, the question arises: is impoverishment a result
        of not enough money or creative ideas, or of program
        failure &quot;because their recipients are inherently
        what they are--blaming the victims. Now, which
        alternative will be chosen by men in power in an age of
        retrenchment?&quot; </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Acceptability of Racist Doctrine </h3>
        <p>What is most notable and least remarked upon about the
        reception of The Bell Curve is the renewed acceptability
        and/or tolerance of straightforward racist doctrine. A
        book that purported to prove, with voluminous statistics,
        that Italians or Jews were inherently stupid or suffered
        from other inherited defects, would not be given
        immediate substantial publicity and serious treatment;
        mainstream commentators would not assert that such a book
        was raising reasonable and even urgent questions that we
        should listen to with open minds. The theme would be seen
        as invidious and insulting to Italians or Jews, and the
        book would have to have phenomenal credentials and
        authentication by experts and notables before it would be
        taken at all seriously in the mainstream media. </p>
        <p>The case of books by &quot;holocaust deniers&quot; is
        instructive in this regard. Many of their works are
        large, stuffed with alleged empirical evidence and
        copious footnotes. But the only books on holocaust denial
        that are given direct press coverage in this country are
        those denouncing the deniers; the denier books themselves
        are ignored and are available only underground. Critics
        of the denier books are indignant, not only at the
        falsifications, but also on the grounds that denial of
        the holocaust is dangerously provocative, is part of a
        larger anti-Semitic package, and is deeply insulting to
        holocaust survivors and their descendants. </p>
        <p>The denier books are, in truth, unworthy of serious
        media attention, but so are many or all of the racist
        tomes attacking blacks that do gain media attention. That
        fact that racist works such as The Bell Curve are deeply
        insulting to blacks seems to have no bearing on their
        treatment in mainstream publications. The fact that for
        100 years anti-black racist theories have surfaced,
        gotten great publicity, and in retrospect can be seen as
        social prejudice translated into purported
        &quot;science,&quot; doesn't interfere with the next
        stage of the same process. </p>
        <p>With characteristic hypocrisy, the New York Times
        editorialized against the &quot;The `Bell Curve'
        Agenda&quot; (Oct. 24), castigating the publicity given
        the book, while a week previously the paper had featured
        it, along with two other similar tomes, on the front page
        of its Sunday Book Review, with a very long and
        thoroughly incompetent whitewash by reporter Malcolm
        Browne (Oct. 16). Browne's review regurgitated all the
        old cliches of discredited racist science, including
        elementary confusions of correlation with causation. The
        reviewer contended that although the arguments of the
        book are &quot;unfashionable and unsafe,&quot; the issues
        are really important to society, although the policy
        conclusions that would follow from The Bell Curve
        argument are left vague. On the one hand, there is the
        clear implication that we should cut budgets supporting
        the genetically hopeless. On the other hand, Browne tells
        his readers that Herrnstein and Murray are deeply worried
        about the enormous &quot;potential for racial
        hatred,&quot; not in the book but in the facts of genes
        and race. That their work might actively contribute to
        racial hatred never occurs to Browne. He even closes his
        review telling readers that &quot;the most insistent plea
        of the four authors is for freedom of debate and an end
        to the shroud of censorship imposed upon scientists and
        scholars by pressure groups...&quot; In other words,
        anti-black theorizing, even if blatant and a rerun of
        long repudiated doctrine, is not provocation and bigotry;
        it is courageous truth-seeking by &quot;scholars.&quot; </p>

        <h3>Racist Traditions and Power </h3>
        <p>There is a physical difference between the white and
        black races which I believe will forever forbid the two
        races living together on terms of social and political
        equality.&quot; That was Abraham Lincoln, the great
        emancipator, in 1858. &quot;I experienced pity at the
        sight of this degraded and degenerate race, and their lot
        inspired compassion in me in thinking that they were
        really men.&quot; This was Louis Agassiz, the great
        Harvard scientist, reflecting on black servants he met at
        a Philadelphia hotel in 1846, from which he drew large
        generalizations. Gould points out in his The Mismeasure
        of Man that &quot;All American culture heroes embraced
        racial attitudes that would embarrass public-school
        mythmakers.&quot; </p>
        <p>Built on black slavery, with segregation and poverty
        helping reinforce stereotypes after 1865, racism has deep
        and persistent roots in this country. Today, racist Bob
        Grant has a radio audience of 680,000 in New York City,
        and racist Rush Limbaugh has a supportive audience of
        millions (extending to Supreme Court Justice Clarence
        Thomas). Reagan with his repeated imagery of black
        welfare mothers exploiting the taxpayer, Bush with Willie
        Horton and the menace of &quot;quotas,&quot; and a slew
        of code words bandied about by politicians, show that
        polarizing racist language and political strategies are
        acceptable and even integral parts of mainstream culture
        today. </p>
        <p>With such a system of attitudes, racist theories
        matching the stereotypes gear into the culture and reach
        a receptive audience, and the marketing strategies of
        book publishers will feed this same maw of hate, just as
        anti-Semitic works had a receptive audience and presented
        a marketing potential to be tapped in Weimar Germany and
        elsewhere in Europe in the years before World War II. </p>

        <h3>Racist Fraud and &quot;Science&quot; History </h3>
        <p>A primary characteristic of propaganda that serves the
        powerful is the blacking out of inconvenient history. In
        the case of weapons &quot;gaps&quot; during the Cold War,
        each new gap claimed by the military-industrial complex
        was taken at face value in the mainstream media and
        treated without any reference to the prior gaps, whose
        fraudulence had been exposed only after the contracts
        were let. </p>
        <p>Reviewers of The Bell Curve don't discuss the Arthur
        Jensen and Cyril Burt stories, or the longer history of
        discredited racist theory. Malcolm Browne, in his Times
        review, mentions Stephen Gould's The Mismeasure of Man in
        a passing phrase; but he does not tap its contents, which
        would show The Bell Curve 's close family resemblance to
        earlier doctrine and refutes argument after argument that
        Browne reports as if fresh and possibly true. </p>
        <p>Gould's The Mismeasure of Man reviews the evolution of
        &quot;scientific&quot; racism, which means &quot;any
        claims apparently backed by copious numbers.&quot;
        Craniometry held the stage for a while, then
        &quot;recapitulationism,&quot; then &quot;neoteny&quot;
        (literally, holding on to youth), and then IQ testing and
        theories of a genetic base to IQ. The drollest phase of
        the evolution of racist theory was the shift from
        recapitulationism to neoteny, as this involved a reversal
        of superior-inferior physical characteristics. In
        recapitulation theory, human embryonic and juvenile
        development recapitulated earlier evolutionary history,
        so that blacks were shown to be inferior by their
        retention of juvenile traits. By the end of the 1920s
        this theory had collapsed in favor of the view that the
        primary feature of human growth was its long retention of
        juvenile features and gradual loss of previous adult
        structures. Under recapitulation, black adults should be
        like white children; under neoteny, white adults should
        be like black children. </p>
        <p>As Gould notes, &quot;For seventy years, under the
        sway of recapitulation, scientists had collected reams of
        data all loudly proclaiming the same message: adult
        blacks, women, and lower class whites are like white
        upper-class male children.&quot; When neoteny came into
        vogue, this data should have demonstrated black
        superiority. But of course this never happened;
        supporters of the new theory &quot;simply abandoned their
        seventy years of hard data and sought new and opposite
        information to confirm the inferiority of blacks.&quot;
        And they found it. </p>
        <p>Gould shows that numerous and eminent scientists
        throughout the 19th and 20th century subtly, or with
        knowing dishonesty, doctored the evidence and
        classification systems and made seriously unscientific
        generalizations to support preconceived racist views. The
        distinguished craniologist Paul Broca collected
        voluminous data on brain and head size showing
        conventionally &quot;superior&quot; groups to have larger
        brains than their inferiors. Gould, after reading Broca's
        major works, found a &quot;definite pattern in his
        methods.&quot; That is, &quot;Conclusions came first and
        Broca's conclusions were the shared assumptions of most
        successful white males during his time....His facts were
        reliable...but they were gathered selectively and then
        manipulated unconsciously...Broca did not fudge numbers;
        he merely selected among them or interpreted his way
        around them to favored conclusions.&quot; </p>
        <p>Gould's book shows that the durable biases and frauds
        of racist science were mainly &quot;honest,&quot; not
        based on conscious deception. In retrospect, however, it
        is readily demonstrable that these scientists were
        embarrassingly wrong, and mainly because they were
        prisoners of racist ideology. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>Jensen and Burt </h3>
        <p>An immediately prior rerun to The Bell Curve, built on
        the modern focus of racist theory on IQ differences, was
        Arthur Jensen's publications of 1969 and 1978. His 1969
        feature article in theHarvard Educational Review,
        &quot;How much can we boost IQ and scholastic
        achievement?,&quot; contended that intelligence was a
        genetically transmitted quantity that could be measured
        by IQ tests, and that the 15 points average difference
        between blacks and whites rested on heredity, not
        environment. Jensen's political bias and lack of
        scientific discipline showed itself in his opening page
        statement that &quot;Compensatory education has been
        tried, and it apparently has failed.&quot; This hint at
        the possible genetic basis of failure misses two points:
        environmental effects go beyond education, and
        compensatory education programs may or may not have been
        of adequate quantity and quality. </p>
        <p>Jensen's main proofs of the dominance of genes rested
        heavily on studies of identical (white) twins brought up
        in different households, which provided the basis for a
        highly dubious estimate that 80 percent of the
        variability in intelligence could be explained by
        heredity. He argued that the 15 point difference in black
        and white IQ scores was too large to be explained by
        environment, given the importance of heredity in fixing
        intelligence. The empirical foundation of this case
        collapsed when it turned out that the leading scientific
        source of identical twin studies, Sir Cyril Burt, had
        concocted data to meet the demands of racist science. </p>
        <p>The theoretical fallacies in Jensen's case run deep.
        Environmental differences could account for substantial
        variation in IQs within groups, but even more clearly the
        importance of the genetic factor within groups tells us
        nothing about what determines the differences in mean
        values between groups--environmental differences could
        easily and fully explain inter-group differences, just as
        they might explain differences in average weights between
        groups, one well nourished, the other undernourished.
        This elementary statistical fallacy was at the heart of
        Jensen's argument. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Jensen got a lot of publicity in 1969,
        and his research, although subject to harsh criticism by
        people like Gould, Richard Lewontin, Steven Rose and Leon
        Kamin, certainly did not cause him to be ostracized as
        another in the line of racists looking for good reasons
        to keep blacks in their place. In fact, when he came up
        with another study along the same line in 1978, Bias in
        Mental Testing, he was once again treated respectfully
        and given space in the mainstream media. Gould points out
        that Jensen's 1978 book comes to exactly the same
        conclusion as his 1969 article, but that he had shifted
        ground from identical twins and genetic theory. &quot;He
        is simply using a different and more indirect, argument
        to prop up the same old claim. And he has buried the
        central fallacies of that argument so deeply among the
        apparent rigor of these 800 pages of lists, figures, and
        charts that no commentator in the mass media managed to
        ferret them out.&quot; In the new book Jensen argued that
        IQ tests are unbiased in measuring intelligence within
        groups, but then subtly uses &quot;unbiased&quot; to mean
        an unbiased measure between groups. He never attempts to
        prove the claim of non-bias between groups, so
        essentially he arrives at his racist conclusion once
        again by an intellectual trick. And once again he fooled
        reviewers in Time and Newsweek, who are receptive to a
        racist message and fool easily. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <h3>Concluding Note </h3>
        <p>Racism is more American than apple pie. The receptive
        mass audience is encouraged in its worst prejudices by
        racist politicians and rightists who see racial
        polarization as helpful to advancing their power and
        agenda. Publishers like Basic Books see a potential best
        seller in The Bell Curve in such an environment. As the
        book is advertised heavily and its racist message is
        approved by large numbers, including many with economic
        and political clout, it is treated as a serious book.
        There is criticism in opinion columns, letters, and some
        reviews, but even the criticisms give it valuable
        publicity. Very few of the reviews frame the book in the
        history of racist &quot;science,&quot; or denounce it as
        another racist insult tending to the encourage negative
        stereotypes and political and social violence against
        black people. This is racism normalized, made acceptable
        to an important racist constituency and fitted to serve
        the political agenda of the powerful, setting the
        intellectual and moral stage for a new wave of harsh
        policies toward the heirs of the victims of the slave
        system. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the early Cold War years the dominant aims of
        establishment intellectuals analyzing Third World issues
        were, first, to counter leftist ideas of exploitation,
        dependency, immiseration, and the necessity of radical
        change; and, second, to rationalize the planned and
        ongoing reshaping of the globe for U.S. imperial
        advantage. The best publicized analysis along these lines
        was Walt Rostow's The Stages of Economic Growth (1960),
        subtitled &quot;A Non-Communist Manifesto, &quot; which
        described a sequence of development whereby Third World
        countries, with judicious foreign aid and investment,
        would gradually modernize their institutions and value
        systems, increase their rates of investment and per
        capita incomes, and take off into sustained growth. In
        the end they would become like us, the obvious final
        product of human development (and history). The
        possibility that the great powers might obstruct or skew
        the Third World development process in accord with their
        own interests was recognized by Rostow, but dismissed. As
        a model Cold Warrior, Rostow naturally found the Soviet
        leadership to be &quot;expansionist &quot; and convinced
        that the rest of the world &quot;must ultimately be
        conquered, &quot; whereas the West only sought
        &quot;partnership &quot; and encouraged Third World
        change that would &quot;keep open the possibility of
        progressive, democratic development. &quot; </p>
        <p>Another influential and less blatantly ideological
        strand of establishment thought arose out of the
        empirical work of the distinguished economist Simon
        Kuznets, who found a tendency for income distribution to
        become less equal during five to seven decades of rapid
        growth, but then to become more equal. Such a pattern,
        which could be graphed as an inverted U curve, seemed to
        fit a number of cases of western economic development.
        Although Kuznets offered the relationship tentatively and
        with qualifications, it soon became &quot;Kuznets law.
        &quot; The law was simple and politically convenient: it
        could explain, and implicitly justify, deteriorating
        income distributions in Third World development under
        First World tutelage. The masses might be miserable now,
        but in place of the old exhortation that they wait for
        their reward in heaven, they could take solace in the
        prospect that their grandchildren might benefit from a
        delayed trickle-down. </p>
        <p>At the very same time as establishment thought was
        giving these benign views of presumably freely-chosen
        development processes in the Third World, the
        U.S....following closely World War II and early postwar
        plans for &quot;Grand Areas &quot; under U.S. control,
        with the Third World serving the needs of the Western
        great powers...was actively intervening to make sure that
        oligarchic structures of control were preserved and
        social democratic reforms would pose no threat to foreign
        investment. Kuznets classic article appeared in 1956;
        Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth was published in 1960.
        Meanwhile, the U.S. had put the Shah on the throne in
        Iran by covert subversion in 1953, and had organized the
        overthrow of an elected government in Guatemala in 1954,
        installing in its place a regime of permanent state
        terror. The important and pace-setting Brazilian coup in
        1964, which also displaced a democratic government with a
        military dictatorship, was enthusiastically supported by
        the liberal Democrats in power in Washington (the coup
        was &quot;the single most decisive victory for freedom in
        the mid-twentieth century &quot; according to U.S.
        Ambassador Lincoln Gordon, later president of Johns
        Hopkins University). Trujillo in the Dominican Republic,
        Duvalier in Haiti, and the Somoza family in Nicaragua had
        taken power following extended U.S. occupation and
        tutelage. The World Bank and IMF were already in place,
        serving to guide Third World countries in proper
        directions. In the mainstream, however, these were all
        defensive, stabilizing, and apolitical efforts, in accord
        with accepted ideological premises. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>Kuznets Law: An Aberration </h3>
        <p>Kuznets law was built on sketchy data drawn from
        western experience. It doesn't apply to Third World
        development, as was apparent even before the final
        victories of the National Security State and the full
        global triumph of the transnational corporation (TNC) and
        neoliberal ideology. Furthermore, the curve of inequality
        has been moving upward again in the West itself,
        suggesting that the earlier decline may have been
        transitory, eventually to be reversed with the full
        maturation of a global capitalism. </p>
        <p>Irma Adelman and Cynthia Taft Morris carried out a
        major test of Kuznets law in application to the Third
        World in their Economic Growth and Social Equity in
        Developing Countries (1973). They examined the
        relationship between 31 different economic, political,
        and cultural variables, and income concentration, for 44
        Third World countries. Their results were
        &quot;consistent with the view of economic backwardness
        under colonialism held by such political economists as
        Paul A. Baran, according to which very uneven income
        distribution is a typical outcome of a narrowly based
        growth process where natural resources are exploited for
        the primary benefit of a small class of wealthy, usually
        expatriate, businessmen.An even more disturbing
        implication of our findings is that development is
        accompanied by an absolute as well as a relative decline
        in the average income of the very poor. Indeed, an
        initial spurt of dualistic growth [where technological
        improvement and income growth are confined to one sector,
        while another frequently traditional sector remains
        small-scale, poor, and politically powerless] may cause
        such a decline for as much as 60 percent of the
        population. The absolute position of the poorest 40
        percent apparently continues to worsen as countries move
        toward less dualistic growth patterns unless major
        efforts are made to improve and expand human resources.
        Thus our findings strongly suggest that there is no
        automatic, or even likely, trickling down of the benefits
        of economic growth to the poorest segments of the
        population in low-income countries. &quot; </p>
        <p>Economist David Felix also studied Kuznets law with
        particular application to Mexico for the period 1885-1975
        ( &quot;Income Distribution Trends in Mexico and the
        Kuznets Curves, &quot; in S. Hewlett and R. Weinert,
        Brazil and Mexico: Patterns in Late Development, 1982).
        Felix found that Mexico's high level of income
        concentration failed to decline, as had those of Great
        Britain, the U.S., and Germany, despite a higher growth
        rate over a longer period than it took the others to
        produce a turnabout. (His finding for the years 1885-1975
        was reinforced by the substantial further increase in
        Mexican income inequality after 1975.) Felix argued that
        Mexico is hardly a special case; that its leveling
        revolution and reformist institutional changes of the
        post World War I era provided conditions more favorable
        to &quot;extensive trickling down &quot; than in a
        majority of Third World states. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>Durable Immiseration Factors </h3>
        <p>Why did inequality not fall in Mexico or Brazil after
        many decades of growth? One reason is that the ruling
        oligarchies rarely projected a national vision of
        independent development; they were satisfied to prosper
        via export bonanzas in indigenous raw materials and
        produce, and they were fearful of depleting the supply of
        cheap agricultural and mining labor. Their lack of
        national-cultural vision and identity was also manifested
        in their long aping of the styles and other cultural
        innovations of Europe and the U.S. This made them object
        lessons in the workings of the &quot;international
        demonstration effect, &quot; whereby national surpluses
        of relative poor countries were frittered away in elite
        purchases of fashionable foreign consumer goods rather
        than being used to stimulate domestic industry or provide
        investment funds for indigenous development. </p>
        <p>In Britain, the U.S., and Japan, industrialization was
        closely tied in with the development of artisan industry,
        which filled niches not adequately supplied by factories
        and provided a technological base important to future
        industrial development. Its growth, along with that of
        factory industry, helped absorb labor surpluses coming
        out of a shrinking or industrializing agriculture. In
        Brazil and Mexico, by contrast, artisan industry declined
        with economic growth, as the elites, who captured
        virtually all the national surplus, preferred foreign
        made and modern goods; artisan industry was left to
        supply the poor. Its decline, and the heavy reliance on
        foreign produced goods, made for technological
        backwardness and technological dependency. </p>
        <p>This form of development also helped consolidate
        dualism and economic-social polarization. In Brazil, some
        30-35 million of the 150 million population, or between a
        fifth and a quarter of the total, live in circumstances
        comparable to those of the middle classes and rich in the
        United States or France. They consume the great bulk of
        fashionable new goods supplied by the modern sector and
        TNCs. Studies of Mexican consumption patterns show that
        &quot;the demand of the lowest 60 percent was
        concentrated on products whose national sales were
        stagnating [i.e., traditional and artisan supplied
        goods], while the top 20-40 percent made up the market
        for successive new goods in the dynamic growth phases of
        their product cycles &quot; (Felix). When puffers of
        Latin American &quot;reform &quot; refer to surging new
        markets and sales in Mexico (or Chile, or Brazil) they
        are speaking of only 20-25 percent of the population--the
        people who count for the puffers. </p>
        <p>The remaining 75-80 percent--the other pole of
        Brazil's dual society--live in wretched conditions in
        huge shantytowns around Rio de Janiero and Sao Paulo, or
        in numerous poor agricultural communities, and consume a
        minute fraction of the hot new consumer goods. Many work
        small land holdings or as part-time agricultural laborers
        in the countryside; those in the shantytowns provide a
        reserve army available to the affluent for household
        service or to the &quot;modern &quot; sector in factories
        or as employees of subcontractors in the &quot;informal
        market. &quot; A large fraction of this Brazilian
        majority are without potable water or sewage facilities,
        have grossly inadequate medical care, and their
        educational resources are reflected in a 35 percent
        illiteracy rate--the percentage of children finishing
        grade school in this fairly wealthy country approximates
        that in Haiti and Guinea-Bissau. It is estimated that
        some 8 million Brazilian children under 14 are homeless
        and live as beggars, thieves, and prostitutes. Several
        thousand of them are murdered each year by police death
        squads, some hired by local businesses to improve the
        climate for tourism. </p>
        <p>The benefits of growth in Brazil and Mexico, both in
        the past and today, have flowed almost entirely to the
        affluent 20-25 percent of the population, plus,
        importantly, foreign TNCs and banks. The residual
        majority is seen by the leadership (and by IMF and World
        Bank officials) largely as a means to elite ends, and
        concern for its well-being almost invariably reflects
        worry that it might cease to be apathetic and upset
        &quot;stability. &quot; The condition of the majority
        therefore constitutes a &quot;management problem, &quot;
        and considerable thought is given to token allocations of
        resources, strategically placed, that will placate,
        divide and immobilize them. </p>
        <p>There have been brief interludes in which the welfare
        of the majority received attention in Mexico. Felix notes
        that the two Mexican presidents who tried to tilt toward
        equity, Adolfo Lopez Mateos (1958-64) and Luis Echeverria
        (1970-76), suffered in consequence from strongly adverse
        reactions by Mexican and foreign business interests,
        including reductions in private investment, and they were
        unable to fulfill their promises. Echeverria &quot;left
        office in a major foreign exchange crisis and amidst
        rumors of a military coup, a novel and portentous
        phenomenon in postwar Mexico. &quot; Peter Evans and Gary
        Gereffi point out, in reference to Echeverria's
        experience, that &quot;Mexico, one of the richest and
        best-behaved nations in the Third World, had only to
        stray slightly from the path of sound business practice
        to end up [suffering a shift] of TNC capital and profit
        flows from a positive $179 million in the 1960 to 1969
        period to a negative $349 million in the period from 1970
        to 1976. Since one can hardly accuse Echeverria of being
        a radical, it would appear that the band of acceptable
        policy is exceedingly narrow and that the penalties for
        straying outside it are strict and swift &quot; (Hewlett
        and Weinert, p. 151). </p>
        <p>The experiences of Allende (Chile, 1973), Goulart
        (Brazil, 1964), Bosch (Dominican Republic, 1963 and
        1965), Arbenz (Guatemala, 1954), and the Sandinistas
        (Nicaragua, 1979-90) show that military intervention,
        sponsored or supported by the U.S., is a very real
        possibility where there is too much &quot;straying &quot;
        beyond the boundaries of service to local and expatriate
        elites. &quot;Security &quot; expenditures remain
        enormous in Latin America; in Argentina, the military
        budget is three times that for education, and more than
        the aggregate for education, health, culture and justice
        combined. In Chile, also, &quot;the military budget in
        1989 outstripped by $432 million the housing, health and
        education budgets combined &quot; (Joseph Collins and
        John Lear, Chile's Free-Market Miracle: A Second Look, p.
        9). The Chilean military budget is exempt from neoliberal
        &quot;shrinking &quot; of government, and is the only
        governmental activity where salaries are linked to the
        cost of living. This priority system is understandable:
        the armed forces preserve the right to immiserate the
        majority. </p>
        <p>The spendthrift habits of Latin elites has also been a
        long-standing factor in periodic balance of payment
        crises: spurts of income growth and inflows of foreign
        capital have led to large increases in consumer imports,
        leaving little margin for adverse changes (declines in
        export prices, sudden fears on the part of foreign
        investors!), which have produced balance of payments
        deficits, panic outflows of capital, and consequent
        deflationary policies and further increases in external
        debt. These developments have enhanced the power of
        foreign lenders and the international financial
        institutions like the IMF, which have forced upon the
        debtor countries policies that worsen all the indigenous
        trends toward inequality. That is, they enforce a primary
        focus on paying the foreign debt, privatization
        (benefiting foreign and local elites), export orientation
        (further concentrating land ownership and accelerating
        the expropriation and marginalization of peasants),
        cutbacks in public expenditures (except export subsidies
        and those for &quot;security &quot;), and deflationary
        macro policies (increasing unemployment, but helping
        creditors). </p>

        <h3>Law of Increasing Immiseration </h3>
        <p>Immiseration rests on the implementation of class
        power in the economy and political arena. A surge of
        immiseration is usually associated with changes in
        technology and markets that create opportunities for the
        dominant class and interest groups. Taking advantage of
        these requires the dispossession of peasants, the
        mobilization of a pliable and cheap labor force,
        intensified exploitation, and the aggressive application
        of state power to further serve business profitability. </p>
        <p>Over extended periods of capitalist development in the
        technologically advanced countries of the West, real
        wages rose markedly and welfare states were put in place,
        although large pools of misery persisted even in good
        times. This came about as a consequence of periods of
        relative labor scarcity, the gradual emergence of labor
        unions, and painfully slow but real gains wrested from a
        capitalist-dominated but not entirely closed political
        system. To this important degree democracy in the West
        has worked; the propertied classes, often not completely
        unified, were induced to allow concessions rather than
        suffer more severe class conflict or take a chance on
        authoritarian rule at home. </p>
        <p>In the 1970s and thereafter, however, international
        competition intensified, and the burdens of high wages
        and a welfare state began to seem intolerable to the U.S.
        business community. New communications technology helped
        make restructuring and foreign outsourcing more
        practicable. The labor movement was in retreat, and the
        power of business was further enhanced by the fluidity of
        money capital, the further centralization of the media,
        and the increased importance of money in politics. Any
        populist tendencies in politics could be snuffed out by
        sustained media assaults, money market discipline, and
        the funding (and defunding) of political campaigns. So
        business could hog-tie and discredit Carter and put in
        place their own servant (Reagan, formerly a hired
        propaganda gun of General Electric Company) to help it
        implement an accelerated program of &quot;reform &quot;
        cum &quot;immiseration. &quot; </p>
        <p>The key factor in this renewed phase of immiserating
        growth, which is taking place on a global basis, is the
        enhanced mobility of capital, which has allowed an
        increasingly active global process of wage-tax-regulation
        arbitrage (i.e., shifting between markets to take
        advantage of price and other differences) and bargaining
        down. The TNCs have been able to tap the vast pools of
        impoverished and underemployed labor in the Third World,
        which provide what economists call an &quot;elastic
        &quot; supply of cheap labor--i.e., wages do not go up as
        the supply is tapped, helped along by regressive
        political regimes, as in Mexico, Indonesia, or China,
        where strikes must be approved by the state and the
        dominant unions are government-controlled. In Indonesia
        an estimated 30 percent of the 83 million workforce is
        underemployed, and another 2 million-plus enter the work
        force each year, &quot;eagerly competing for the
        $1.75-a-day jobs being created in the cities &quot;
        (Merrill Goozner, &quot;Asian labor: Wages of shame,
        &quot;Chicago Tribune, Nov. 6, 1994). </p>
        <p>Since 1979, China's &quot;market socialism &quot;
        leaders have allowed some 177,000 foreign-organized joint
        ventures or independent firms to set up shop in special
        economic zones, tapping some 60-100 million peasants,
        millions of them young women, lured by the promise of
        factory jobs. These workers have been subjected to
        &quot;working conditions that have not been seen since
        the dawn of industrial capitalism in the early 19th
        century, &quot; a &quot;killing field &quot; of workers
        (206 factory fires resulting in 10 or more deaths, 19,000
        work fatalities in the first 8 months of 1994 by official
        estimate), with the enforcement of law and worker
        protection non-existent Attempts to create independent
        labor organizations to correct the severe abuses have
        been met with &quot;fierce repression &quot; in both
        China and Indonesia, and Tribune reporters put the two
        countries in the same class: &quot;The one-party regimes
        of nominally communist China and right-wing authoritarian
        Indonesia have reacted to the labor unrest in a similar
        fashion for similar reasons &quot;--they worry about
        challenges to authoritarian rule and the demands of
        foreign investors (Uli Schmetzer and Merrill Goozner,
        &quot;Growing workplace fatalities dim glow of Chinese
        economy, &quot; Chicago Tribune, Nov. 8, 1994). </p>
        <p>These supply conditions disconnect wages and
        productivity, so that economic growth &quot;is not
        lifting all boats &quot; in China and Indonesia, the
        world's first and fourth most populous nations, and
        &quot;a wave of labor unrest has swept over both
        countries in the last year as the promise of a better
        life from working in industry proved false for millions
        of uprooted agricultural workers. &quot; The delinkage
        can go far, with real wages sometimes declining while
        productivity soars; thus, real wages in Mexico in the
        years 1980-1992 fell 32 percent while manufacturing
        productivity increased by 41 percent. </p>
        <p>Arbitrage, along with Third World labor supply
        conditions, necessarily affects wages and working
        conditions in the high income countries, by putting
        steady downward pressure on the higher wage levels. This
        has weakened the relationship between productivity and
        wage rates in the high wage countries as well, where real
        wage growth is now consistently below the rate of
        productivity increase. In the U.S., between 1973 and 1992
        average hourly real wages fell 1 percent, while
        productivity rose by more than 15 percent. The other side
        of the coin, of course, was the sharp increase in
        executive pay (19 percent, 1979-89) and, more important,
        the enormous increase in capital income (up 65 percent,
        realized capital gains up 205 percent, 1979-89), all
        reflected in the substantial increase in income
        inequality. </p>
        <p>These numbers show that at this juncture a very large
        fraction of any global productivity advances are being
        captured by a small elite of local compradors and
        political and military leaders, and foreign banks and
        TNCs. This elite is even able, brazenly, to impose
        further absolute reductions in the living standards of
        the already impoverished majority to sustain elite
        incomes in times of difficulty--thus Zedillo's adjustment
        package to meet Mexico's current crisis centers on
        forcing real wages down, and IMF imposed austerity plans
        consistently involve budget cuts, deflationary macro
        policies, and wage restraints that put the burden of
        adjustment on the impoverished. The poor majority, who do
        not share in the gains of productivity growth, still must
        provide the fallback resources to assure payment to those
        who do benefit from growth. </p>
        <p>In sum, the technological, economic, political, and
        ideological environment of the New World Order has
        strengthened the traditional forces making for inequality
        and immiseration. TNC mobility and power in economic
        life, the media, and politics, has entrenched the belief
        that there is no other policy option than creating a
        favorable climate for investment; it has put opposition
        groups into disarray and in weakened positions, and with
        no obvious strategies for defense or means of regaining
        initiatives; it has unleashed the forces of irrationality
        (immigrant threat, racism) to help smooth the way to
        dismantling the welfare state; and it has led us into a
        new era of renewed aggressive class warfare and
        unconstrained search for global advantage. A revised
        &quot;law &quot; of the trend in inequality seems
        plausible: that, given the increasing imbalance in the
        global power of capital and labor, we may expect
        inequality and immiseration to increase until either a
        new and potent resistance force emerges from the
        oppressed or the now unconstrained forces of capital
        produce a Big Bang (with unknown fallout effects
        thereafter). </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The musical tradition known as jazz is a hybrid with
        roots in West Africa, Europe, the Caribbean, and North America.
        Nonetheless, over the last four decades, many African-American
        musicians have become increasingly vocal regarding the
        idea that jazz is essentially a black art form. In brief,
        the argument for the blackness of jazz contends that although
        jazz is not entirely &quot;pure,&quot; the most immediate
        and significant ancestors of jazz (work songs, spirituals,
        blues, ragtime, and brass band music) were expressions
        rooted in black communal life. And in the music's hundred
        year existence, the tradition's greatest innovators (Louis
        Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Charlie
        Parker, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, and Ornette
        Coleman, to mention only a few) have been black. </p>
        <p>Needless to say the view of jazz as black music is controversial.
        It politicizes the world of art and entertainment, it
        reminds of racial division, and ultimately it rankles
        notions of white supremacy. For some, it is a statement
        of reverse racism aimed at white jazz musicians and is destructive
        to a &quot;truly democratic music.&quot; All of these
        issues are addressed in Gene Lees's recent book about
        jazz and race, Cats Of Any Color: Jazz Black And White(Oxford University
        Press, New York). </p>
        <p>Lees, a veteran jazz critic and former editor of Down
        Beat magazine, draws the title and central theme of his
        essays from Louis Armstrong's comment, &quot;It's no
        crime for cats of any color to get together and
        blow.&quot; Believing that jazz is not the property of
        any one racial group, Lees takes this quote as a
        reflection of the jazz tradition's noble effort to explore
        &quot;the full range of human experience and
        emotion.&quot; Unfortunately, as Lees freely
        acknowledges, jazz lives in a society where questions
        around the artistic and economic ownership of jazz remain
        racially volatile. </p>
        <p>To provide some background to the conflict, Lees
        presents a number of anecdotes illustrating the plight of black
        jazz musicians during the heyday of Jim Crow racism.
        Included are tales of a 10-year-old Horace Silver
        observing a concert of Jimmie Lunceford's band through a wooden fence
        separating him from an outdoor whites-only show in Connecticut;
        of revered artists such as Oscar Peterson and Nat Cole
        being refused hair cuts and meals because of their skin
        color; of the pressures and sanctions bearing on musicians
        challenging segregation; and of the general disparity
        between black and white musicians in monetary rewards and popular
        recognition. </p>
        <p>While most serious, liberal-minded jazz fans have some awareness
        of the racist conditions plaguing black jazz players
        throughout this century, Lees's stories are nonetheless
        poignant and necessary reminders of where jazz is coming
        from. But in laying out some of the old fashioned racial
        barriers imposed on jazz, Lees has another agenda in
        mind. Assuming that anti-black feelings are no longer a major
        problem in the world of jazz, Lees now fears that the
        historical cumulative effects of white racism have
        produced a reverse racism that threatens to destroy the
        egalitarian heart of jazz. </p>
        <p>Lees's evidence of the rise of &quot;black xenophobia
        in jazz&quot; comes mainly from the statements of African American musicians
        and writers (Amiri Baraka, Spike Lee, Archie Shepp,
        Stanley Crouch and Wynton Marsalis) advocating jazz as a
        black-defined aesthetic. He asserts, however, that the
        idea of black supremacy in jazz has become so popular and
        politically correct that jazz audiences, black jazz musicians,
        and even white jazz critics routinely discriminate
        against white musicians and downgrade their contributions
        to the jazz heritage. An upholder of jazz as basically an
        interracial art form celebrating &quot;the human spirit&quot;
        and &quot;personal vision,&quot; Lees argues that
        &quot;any statement that jazz is black music and only black music
        is racist on the face of it.&quot; </p>
        <p>To be sure, there are kernels of truth in Lees's
        argument. Jazz has never been exclusively black. Its
        origins are multicultural and scholars on the subject
        agree that at the turn of the century, when the music
        became a recognizable idiom, white and black musicians
        were playing similar, though not identical, forms of music.
        It is also true that numerous white musicians (Bix
        Beiderbecke, Benny Goodman, Harry James, Zoot Sims, Gerry
        Mulligan, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Dave Brubeck, and
        Charlie Haden among them) have left distinguished marks
        on jazz history. It may be further conceded that
        historically African American jazz players have harbored
        some bitterness about white musicians &quot;stealing
        music&quot; originated by black musicians. None of this,
        however, adds up to a rebuttal of &quot;jazz as black
        music.&quot; </p>
        <p>In recent years a generation of young black jazz
        musicians has taken on the mission of re-establishing the significance of
        jazz as an African American defined art form. This advocacy,
        however, does not include claims that all jazz is about
        or for only black people. Nor has it been argued that whites,
        by virtue of genes or culture, are incapable of playing authentic
        and original jazz. What has been articulated is the centrality
        of jazz to African American culture. Which is to say, the
        jazz expression of black Americans is a creative reflection
        of black experience. </p>
        <p>Given the historical circumstances of black life in
        the United States, the many black musical roots of jazz, and
        the preponderance of technical and stylistic inventions
        of African American jazz players, it seems clear that the black
        impact on jazz weighs heavier than that of other groups
        in our society. Interpreting &quot;the black
        experience&quot; at times narrowly and at other times abstractly,
        Lees, however, finds the proposition of black jazz near
        absurd. In his dramatic, overblown polemic he complains,
        &quot;How anyone can think that the art of Louis
        Armstrong--or Benny Carter or Count Basie or Coleman
        Hawkins or John Coltrane--is the cry of pain of a downtrodden
        people is beyond me.&quot; Later he concludes that jazz
        is &quot;dead&quot; if it is useful only &quot;for the
        expression of anger and resentments of an American
        minority.&quot; </p>
        <p>No one, of course, has ever argued that jazz or
        blackness is only about pain and suffering. Wynton Marsalis
        has, in fact, described jazz as &quot;optimistic
        music.&quot; And down through the century, black musicians
        have stated and publicly demonstrated that jazz is a
        music with universal appeal. Nevertheless, it is also a
        music that takes its primary inspiration from the struggles
        and achievements of the black community. </p>
        <p>&quot;Music is your own experience, your thoughts,
        your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of
        your horn.&quot; --Charlie Parker </p>
        <p>&quot;You probably would take a white kid and subject
        him to the same things that one of us was subjected to and
        he'd probably stomp his foot just like we do. It's not a
        matter of race, but environment.&quot; --Dizzy Gillespie </p>
        <p>&quot;For a long time, social protest and pride in the
        Negro have been the most significant themes in what we've
        done. In that music we have been talking for a long time
        about what it is to be a Negro in this country.&quot;
        --Duke Ellington </p>
        <p>&quot;I can't see any separation between my music and
        my life. I play pretty much race music: its about what happened
        to my father, to me, and what can happen to my
        kids.&quot; --Archie Shepp </p>
        <p>&quot;A lot of it [the music] has to do with all the
        things I experienced growing up in New Orleans, that kind
        of feeling of fraternity, of humor, of style, food,
        dances, parades, churches, ribbing, family, sports,
        girls--all of it.&quot; --Wynton Marsalis </p>
        <p>Although Lees has been around jazz a long time and is obviously
        familiar with statements of this kind, they have left
        little impression on his perspective. A white Canadian who
        professes to be &quot;color blind,&quot; Lees hears in
        jazz only abstract humanity. Still, when he digs through history
        to redress the neglect of white contributions to jazz, he consistently
        exaggerates the Anglo-European influence on black
        creativity. Yes it is true that Charlie Parker admired Stravinsky;
        that Miles Davis employed many white musicians and
        admitted the influence of white trumpeters Harry James
        and Bobby Hackett; that Ellington's cornetist Rex Stewart studied
        the solos of Bix Beiderbecke. But this hardly means that
        the genius of Parker, Davis, and Stewart was equally
        derived from black and white sources. </p>
        <p>Lees's color blindness also presents a problem when it comes
        to recognizing the political economy of jazz. Particularly
        since the birth of modern jazz in the 1940s, black
        musicians have been outspoken critics of how the white
        domination of record companies, clubs and festivals,
        magazines, television, and movies hinders the visibility
        and profitability of jazz. As trumpeter Jimmy Owens once
        explained: &quot;Black music has never really been
        controlled by the people who are making that music. Consequently,
        the amount of money going to the people who perform that
        music, the musicians, has been very small compared to
        what goes to the people who control the music.&quot;
        While Lees is well aware of this obvious sore spot on &quot;jazz black
        and white,&quot; his fragmented, selectively focused
        portrait of jazz history tends to overemphasize the popularity
        and critical esteem enjoyed by black jazz musicians. As a result,
        when he quotes from black protests against the white,
        corporate-dominated music industry, the statements come
        off more as allegation (and anti-Semitism) than fact. </p>
        <p>Interestingly, Lees seems much more committed to addressing
        the contemporary racial bias in jazz, which he finds most
        powerfully embodied in Wynton Marsalis's directorship of
        the prestigious Lincoln Center jazz program. Lees
        condemns Marsalis for firing most of the organization's
        white employees, hiring and honoring only black
        musicians, and preaching a jazz as black music ideology.
        And in all of this Lees sees the creeping institutionalization
        of anti-white blackness. Someone a shade or two less wary
        and not so color blind, might view these moves
        cautiously, but as an imperfect effort at artistic
        affirmative action. But Lees's reaction is so hasty and
        hysterical that one must assume he carries an abiding affection
        for the good old days of &quot;jazz black and
        white.&quot; </p>
        <p>The Marsalis Defense: In August of the past year,
        Wynton Marsalis responded to charges of racism in a debate
        with jazz historian James Lincoln Collier at the Lincoln
        Center in New York. At that time he presented statistics
        showing that he had hired and showcased many white
        musicians in the center's jazz program. More recently, he
        has commented on the criticism of Gene Lees. In a
        December 18, 1994 interview with San Francisco Examiner reporter Joan
        Smith, Marsalis explained: &quot;I work with musicians I think
        are playing the best music. It's not true that we hire only
        black musicians, but even if we did would that be so odd?
        Would it be odd if you organized a polka festival and all
        the musicians were white? To say that my tastes are racist
        because I don't think a musician should be included that
        you think should be included is just plain wrong. </p>
        <p>&quot;As long as there is democracy, there will be
        people wanting to play jazz because nothing else will
        ever so perfectly capture the democratic process in
        sound. Jazz means working things out musically with other people. You
        have to listen to other musicians and play with them even
        if you don't agree with what they're playing. It teaches you
        the very opposite of racism and anti-Semitism. It teaches
        you that the world is big enough to accommodate us
        all.&quot; </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Feminist sex radicals (who in these times are almost
        always lesbians) have repeatedly challenged heterosexual
        feminists &quot;to come out of the closet.&quot; We're
        still waiting, they tell us, wearily, for you to discuss
        your sexuality, stop generalizing and get specific:
        &quot;Is domination and subordination a clear-cut issue
        in heterosexual sex? Do heterosexual feminists have
        thoughts on SM? Has anyone sighted a butch-het woman and
        femme-het man together?&quot; Silence, as usual, greeted
        their challenge. </p>
        <p>It is a silence I have come to expect. Straight women
        have been on a bumpy ride for some considerable time. But
        in many ways it has been bumpiest for those closest to
        feminism. In recent years it has been feminist polemic,
        rather than male backlash, which has done most to confuse
        and discourage new thoughts on sexuality. Heterosexuality
        has been coupled consistently with male violence, and
        presented as both the cause and enactment of men's power
        over women. How, we might well wonder, did a movement
        which came out of, and drew its initial strength and
        inspiration from, the assertive sex radicalism of the
        1960s manage to produce so many who would end up so
        silent about their own sexuality? It is a concern which
        was not only central to the genesis of feminism, but
        remains central to the majority of women. </p>
        <p>The first impediment was, of course, men. Men as they
        are, and as they are figured in the dominant ideals of
        masculinity which mold their behavior.
        &quot;Masculinity&quot; in Western culture means, at
        least in part, the sexual pursuit of women, expressed in
        a type of sexist brogadaccio which betrays both a fear of
        real intimacy and a horror of &quot;weakness&quot; or
        &quot;effeminacy.&quot; Challenges to its presumptions
        can motivate men's rage and violence--often towards women
        or gay men--through attempts to shore up a flagging sense
        of personal power. But it may also encourage rebellion
        against oppressive forms of male identity, albeit with
        still limited success. </p>
        <p>The second restraint, holding back discussion of
        women's erotic desires, came from within feminism. It was
        the attempt to identify authentically &quot;female&quot;
        bodily experiences. These were to serve as alternative
        images, to be contrasted with the
        &quot;custom-made-woman&quot; designed only to please and
        titillate men. But the search for some fully autonomous,
        self-directed sexuality (only to be found in
        masturbation) would lead some women to abandon, and
        others to say no more, and certainly to write no more,
        about their longings for the admiration, desire, and
        physical intimacy of men. </p>
        <p>The many insecurities and uncertainties women feel
        about their bodies leaves little space between reclaiming
        sex and the setting of norms. For a while, it was only a
        small group of defiant lesbians who felt confident enough
        to question the utopianism and growing prescriptiveness
        in feminist accounts of a distinctively
        &quot;womanly&quot; desire for benign, sensual,
        egalitarian relationships. They spoke instead of the
        complexity, ambivalence, and unsettling elements of power
        and submission present in all desire--female as well as
        male. </p>
        <p>The final impasse was thus the inescapable
        contrariness of sexual passion. Some level of confusion
        was inevitable in re-thinking women's sexual agency,
        given the crucible of contradictions at the heart of
        sexual desire triggering emotions which make us feel both
        powerful and defenseless at the same moment. This was
        further complicated by a change in the political climate.
        All kinds of social anxieties are easily displaced onto
        sexuality, and the right knows just how to orchestrate
        hostility against sexual &quot;permissiveness&quot; as
        the cause of social &quot;decay&quot;--seen most recently
        in their virulent attacks on single mothers. Retreat from
        optimistic feminist hopes for women's sexual liberation
        was always likely to accompany the defeat of broader
        attempts to build a more caring and equal society. And so
        in the 1980s it did. </p>
        <p>Yet even as Catharine MacKinnon gains a popular
        readership for her own particular brand of sexually
        repressive feminist rhetoric, telling women that feeling
        good in sex with men is merely enjoying the seeds of
        victimhood, something is clearly awry. For feminism's
        greatest influence came from its campaigns in the name of
        the sexual liberation she denounces. Demanding women's
        control over their own bodies and seeking changes in
        their relationships with men brought more responsive and
        respectful gynecological provision and made it possible
        to identify and object to sexual harassment, redefine
        rape, and prioritize violence against women. &quot;Part
        of my attraction to feminism involved the right to be a
        sexual person,&quot; one North American feminist ruefully
        recalls, &quot;I'm not sure where that history got
        lost.&quot; </p>
        <p>What is more, the current thrust of feminist criticism
        of heterosexuality is at odds with what most women are
        saying about their sex lives. No longer ahead, but out of
        step with many women's dreams and desires, feminism in
        the 1980s became pessimistic or silent about straight sex
        just when women themselves were displaying much of its
        former enthusiasm for sexual (and social) independence.
        Reflecting a new liberal acceptance of women's sexuality
        outside wedlock, marriage rates in most Western countries
        were declining, divorce rates rapidly rising, and many
        women were choosing to cohabit. Parenting was being
        postponed until careers were established and, overall,
        women were having fewer children by the 1980s than in the
        1960s. </p>
        <p>Married women, it seemed, were also receiving greater
        satisfaction from sex with their husbands. Morton Hunt's
        survey of sexual behavior in the U.S. in the 1970s
        reported far greater variety and frequency of sexual
        activity compared with Alfred Kinsey's a generation
        before: 90 percent of wives claimed to be happy with
        their sex lives, three-quarters were content with its
        frequency, with one-quarter wanting more. Blumstein and
        Schwartz reported much the same from their extensive
        survey of couples a decade later. Women and men were
        displaying similar sexual preferences, desiring frequent
        sexual activity, happiest when initiating or refusing sex
        equally as often, and--whether heterosexual, gay or
        lesbian--became discontented if sex was infrequent. </p>
        <p>British surveys agree. They show women initiating more
        sexual contacts, and married women having more affairs,
        reflecting their heightened expectations and sense of
        sexual agency. Contrary to conservative hopes or feminist
        warnings, the most recent survey of sexual behavior (the
        one Margaret Thatcher tried to abort by withdrawing
        promised funding) concluded that sex is both far safer
        and less fraught for women today than ever before. The
        overwhelming majority use contraception during their
        first sexual intercourse, and three out of four women
        felt that it occurred at about the right time, for the
        right reasons. </p>
        <p>There is thus a dramatic lack of fit between what one
        very visible group of feminists have been saying about
        women's experience of sexual victimization, and what most
        women have been reporting about their experiences of sex,
        and its importance to them. Nevertheless, while the gap
        between women's and men's sex lives is narrowing, and
        marriages seem happier, this is probably only because of
        the high rates of divorce. One in two marriages in the
        U.S., and over one in three in Britain, were headed for
        divorce in the 1980s, the majority initiated by women
        unhappy with the &quot;unliberated&quot; behavior of
        their husbands, behavior which includes significant
        amounts of abuse against women and children. </p>
        <p>When women's frustrations do lead to separation or
        divorce, they are economically disadvantaged. A woman may
        be just a divorce away from poverty. Nevertheless,
        contrary to the backlash stories broadcasting the bleak
        situation of women after divorce as a warning to them to
        stay married, it is actually men who most fear and try to
        prevent marital break-ups--sometimes with more of the
        violence which provokes it. Teenage pregnancy (though far
        from the spiraling problem conservatives denounce) can
        leave young women and their children impoverished. Around
        a quarter of adolescent girls still complain of feeling
        pressurized into having sex with boys, and most report
        little physical pleasure from their early sexual
        experiences, finding it hard to talk about sex with their
        partners. </p>
        <p>In fact, when Lillian Rubin set out to discover the
        impact of the sexual revolution in the U.S., she found
        that both men and women typically spoke of being
        &quot;disappointed&quot; with their first encounter with
        genital heterosexuality. But whereas men almost all saw
        it as an important achievement on the way to manhood
        (exposing the seeds for men's frequent resort to sexual
        coerciveness), no woman saw it as definitive of
        womanhood. (Menstruation conventionally serves as the far
        more ambivalent marker of entry into womanhood). Women's
        most frequent regret was feeling cheated of the
        &quot;romantic fantasy&quot; they had hoped to fulfill.
        Even so, most contemporary reports on teenage girls and
        their culture show them as much tougher and more in
        control of their lives than the previous generation. </p>
        <p>More women are feeling satisfied in their sex lives
        with men. Yet they still suffer disproportionately from
        (and pervasively fear) sexual assault from men. How can
        we shift the sexual codes which encourage coerciveness
        from men, endorse compliance from women, and continue to
        serve as barriers to change? Only by re-thinking the very
        idea of heterosexuality. </p>
        <p>At the heart of the problem is the way in which
        &quot;masculinity&quot; and &quot;femininity&quot; ties
        in with the cultural symbolism of the sex act:
        masculinity as activity, femininity as passivity. As
        lesbian theorist Judith Butler has recently argued,
        gender contrasts gain much of their meaning through this
        more basic image of heterosexuality. Yet it is one which
        obscures the diverse initiations and activities which
        actually take place between women and men. It is this
        symbolism which we need to keep on challenging if we are
        ever to turn around the idea that sex is something men do
        and women have done to them--with all its oppressive
        spin-offs, for both women and gay men. </p>
        <p>The first way to do this is to talk more, not less,
        about heterosexual experiences and bodily contacts. For
        it is here that the presumed polarities of gender most
        often falter and blur. In contrast with the writing which
        suggests that we can never escape its
        &quot;subordinating&quot; meanings for women, there is
        actually little that is firmly fixed about these supposed
        oppositions. Sexual pleasure--taking us all the way back
        to the fears and longings of childhood attachments--is as
        much about letting go and losing control for men as it is
        for women. There is nothing inevitable about either the
        occurrence or the preferred form of heterosexual bonding.
        As any prostitute knows, straight men are both terrified
        of, yet passionately attracted to, powerlessness and loss
        of control. </p>
        <p>Sexuality can be as much a place for male as for
        female vulnerability (though any physical coercion men
        face is almost always from other men). This is why men,
        more than women, often remain fearful of physical
        closeness, denying themselves the pleasures of passivity
        which, in the end, is what much of joyful sex is all
        about. Men, much like women, long for what they also fear
        and dread: the intense vulnerability which accompanies
        the embraces, enclosures, and penetrations of
        another--whether rhythmically stroked by fingers,
        tongues, lips, teeth, arms, or that most fragile of
        appendages, the penis. The distinction between inside and
        outside breaks down as fingers, lips, nose or tongue
        wander over, in and between the flesh of the other. </p>
        <p>There are many &quot;heterosexuality's,&quot; and all
        sexuality's, including lesbian and gay ones, are
        &quot;hetero&quot; in one way or another. There is
        diversity and &quot;otherness&quot; in same-sex
        encounters and relationships, and there are pluralities
        of cross-sex meetings. It is usually assumed that we
        consolidate our gender identity and endorse male
        dominance through sex--heterosex: &quot;A man can become
        more male and a woman more female by coming together in
        the full rigors of the fuck,&quot; Norman Mailer crows.
        But do we? Sex is often the most troubling of all social
        encounters precisely because it so easily threatens
        rather than confirms gender polarity. The merest glimpse
        of the complexity of women's and men's actual activities
        suggests that straight sex may be no more affirmative of
        normative gender positions (and in that sense no less
        &quot;perverse&quot;) than its gay and lesbian
        alternatives. In consensual sex, when bodies meet, the
        epiphany of that meeting--its threat and excitement--is
        precisely that all the great dichotomies
        (activity/passivity, subject/object,
        heterosexual/homosexual) slide away. </p>
        <p>Indeed, some have suggested that men's phallic swagger
        is not so much about denying power to women, although it
        certainly has that corollary, as the denial of the
        reality, the pleasure, and the assertive pull of men's
        feelings of passivity and dependency. Yet surveys on
        health, happiness, and sexual patterns have been
        highlighting for some time now that, as a recent U.S.
        study puts it: &quot;What most men really need is to
        develop their &quot;feminine&quot; side and become more
        focused on relationships, more emotionally expressive and
        more comfortable with being dependent.&quot; </p>
        <p>Men's dangerous anxieties over power
        (&quot;manhood&quot;), and for some the accompanying
        resort to sexual coerciveness, will only fade away with
        the passing of their general social dominance--which was
        always the motor of &quot;phallic&quot; symbolism. But
        within the diversity of heterosexual encounters and
        relationships, some are compulsive, oppressive,
        pathological, or disabling; others pleasurable,
        self-affirming, supportive, reciprocal, or empowering.
        Many move between the two. Taking note of the
        self-display and barely covert homoeroticism currently
        thriving (and selling commodities) as never before in
        images of men in the media, any insistence that male
        sexuality is simply predatory looks little more than a
        new way of affirming what it pretends to deplore. </p>
        <p>I am not suggesting, however, that the struggle to
        break the codes linking active (&quot;masculine&quot;)
        sexuality to cultural hierarchies of gender will ever be
        easy. Sex and gender hierarchies have survived despite
        their increasingly obvious contradictions. It is a trap
        to assume (with the Cosmopolitan-led, fashionably
        feminine layer of mass-culture) that we can ignore both
        the symbolic dimensions of language and the existing
        relations of power between women and men. In Cosmo and
        its ilk, women are presented as already the equal sexual
        partners of men, and told how to obtain and please their
        men, as if men were all seeking much the same advice. </p>
        <p>Such rhetoric nonchalantly neglects the extent of
        men's power over women, and its defensive facade of
        endemic misogyny: apparent from the merest scratch on the
        liberal surface of sexual equality. Who's afraid of
        women's independence? Of the single working woman? The
        single mother? The sexual female? Watch your local cinema
        for clues. </p>
        <p>We must also take on board the mass-cultural images of
        women: especially romance fiction. We imbibe it from our
        mothers fantasies and daydreams and our own enjoyment of
        popular film or novels, where we see ourselves reflected
        only in the waiting female heroine. Many studies of young
        women's sexual experiences point to the disabling aspect
        of this heritage. Defining sex in terms of love and
        romance is the main reason young women offer for allowing
        their male partner to dictate their sex lives. It also
        explains their frequent disappointment, even though the
        pervasive games with power in such narratives reveal some
        of the contradictions of &quot;feminine&quot;
        identifications. </p>
        <p>Yet however powerful the iconography of sex and the
        conventions of romance, their effects are diverse. If the
        first trap for sexual radicals is to ignore the
        constraints of symbolic codes and social hierarchies, the
        second trap is to declare them fixed and immutable. In
        fact, they are chronically fragile and unstable, easy to
        subvert or parody--however equally easily recuperated.
        There have always been men who could consciously delight
        in being the object of a woman's or a man's desire; and
        who could see the penis as, merely, a penis. Just as
        there have always been women who are lusty, aggressive
        and sexually dominating, and everything in between. Many
        already suspect that it is precisely the icons of
        masculinity who can barely conceal the &quot;woman,&quot;
        the &quot;faggot,&quot; inside. The more rigid the sexual
        norms people feel they must affirm, the greater the
        threat of all those experiences they struggle to exclude. </p>
        <p>As I have indicated, it is lesbians and gay men who
        have played the critical role in revealing the artifice
        of the gender and sexual oppositions constructing
        heterosexual norms. These norms not only provide
        repressive accounts of heterosexual experience. More
        destructively, they impose themselves on homosexual
        experience too, producing our lasting images of the
        &quot;effeminate&quot; male and &quot;butch&quot;
        lesbian. Today, &quot;queer&quot; activists turn
        traditional symbols on their head. Whether insisting that
        penetration is no more heterosexual than kissing, waving
        the lesbian &quot;phallus,&quot; or asserting the power
        of passivity,&quot; they subvert the heterosexual norms
        which have tried to imprison them. </p>
        <p>What I want to suggest is that straight women (and
        men) should also play a part in this subversion. Instead
        of guilt-tripping heterosexuals, we would do better to
        enlist them in the &quot;queering&quot; of traditional
        understandings of gender and sexuality, questioning all
        the ways in which women's bodies have been coded as
        uniquely &quot;passive,&quot; &quot;receptive,&quot; or
        &quot;vulnerable.&quot; But we must also look at male
        heterosexual desire (and how their bodies become
        &quot;receptive&quot; and &quot;vulnerable&quot;) since
        the two are inextricably linked. </p>
        <p>We all, and young people especially, need new sources
        of sex education, new erotic narratives which depict both
        women and men asserting or surrendering control in
        situations of mutual esteem, safety, and pleasure.
        Surveying the diversity of heterosexualities enables us
        to affirm those encounters which are based on trust and
        affection (however brief or long-lasting), and to wonder
        (because it is never easy) how best to strengthen women
        to handle those which are not. </p>
        <p>There is still a long way to go in creating a radical
        sexual politics that includes heterosexuality. When Joan
        Nestle wrote her moving recollection, &quot;My Mother
        Likes to Fuck,&quot; other women picketed the London
        magazine which published it. In it she had dared to
        protest: &quot;Don't scream penis at me, but help to
        change the world so no woman feels shame or fear because
        she likes to fuck.&quot; Quite so. Straight women, like
        gay men and lesbians, have everything to gain from
        asserting our non-coercive desire to fuck if, when, how,
        and as we choose. </p>

    <h1 align="center">A Review of <br>
    A Future For Socialism <br>
    By John Roemer </h1>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><em>Robin Hahnel </em></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><em></em></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>According to Samuel Bowles, A Future for Socialism by
        John Roemer is &quot;measured, highly accessible, and
        most of all compelling.&quot; Spurred by this
        enthusiastic recommendation from my former teacher and esteemed colleague,
        I tore into the text anticipating penetrating insights about
        why, in Roemer's words, &quot;socialism is not
        dead.&quot; Unfortunately I found Roemer's book uninformed
        rather than measured, pedantic rather than accessible,
        and completely uncompelling. Worse still, if Roemer's model of
        what he sometimes calls &quot;managerial market socialism&quot;
        and sometimes a &quot;coupon economy&quot; were all that
        remains of socialism-- socialism should be dead. </p>
        <p>Roemer recommends changing the U.S. economy in two
        respects only: </p>
        <p>1) Void present ownership of corporations and issue
        everyone identical portfolios of stocks giving each person,
        initially, an equal share of ownership in every
        corporation in the economy. People would then be free to
        trade their shares of stock in one company for shares in another, but
        not permitted to trade shares of stock for money or
        goods. </p>
        <p>2) Organize corporations into Japanese style
        conglomerates, or Keiretsu, headed by a major investment bank
        that would (a) own significant blocks of stock in the
        corporations under its tutelage, (b) loan its corporate clients
        funds for investment, and (c) monitor the performance of corporate
        management. </p>
        <p>The rationale for the first change is to diminish
        non-labor income differentials. The rationale for the second
        is to create a mechanism for financing investment and
        weeding out managers who fail to maximize profits from
        those who do. Roemer claims this economy would be more egalitarian
        than capitalism and no less efficient, and argues that anti-capitalists
        should redefine the socialist project as achieving a &quot;coupon economy.&quot; </p>
        <p>If socialism wasn't in enough trouble before Roemer
        volunteered to come to its rescue, it certainly will be if
        socialists follow his advice. The most obvious problem
        with Roemer's redefinition of the socialist project is that
        the human costs of transition to his vision would remain high,
        while the benefits of changing from capitalism to his
        coupon economy would be meager. We do not have to rely on
        our own instincts about how much difference Roemer's coupon
        ownership scheme would make. According to his calculations--in
        an appendix remarkable for its inanity--the coupon system
        would only have increased median Black income in the
        United States by 2 percent in 1989. And a more egalitarian
        income distribution is the only benefit Roemer claims for his
        coupon economy. Roemer admits people would have no more control
        over their work lives in a coupon economy than in
        capitalism, which is not a painful concession for Roemer
        because he argues this is not a serious liability, or necessarily even
        bad. He offers no reason to believe &quot;managerial
        socialist&quot; markets would do any better job than capitalist
        markets dealing with public effects, ecological impact,
        and other externalities of economic buying and selling. And
        Roemer's reason for believing more egalitarian corporate ownership
        would lead citizens to vote for significantly more stringent restrictions
        on corporate pollution through the political process is uncompelling.
        So the gross inefficiencies and environmental destruction
        resulting from external effects in market allocations
        would go largely unabated in a coupon economy. Roemer
        recommends nothing beyond standard fiscal and monetary
        policy and indicative planning, which leaves his coupon economy
        as vulnerable to the destructive vagaries of market disequilibria
        as the French economy under Charles De Gaulle. </p>
        <p>In short, a coupon economy would be no less alienating
        and inefficient than capitalism, and only marginally less
        unfair. And it would still be an economy where a class of
        coordinators dominated and exploited ordinary workers, as
        Roemer freely admits. He makes no apologies for his
        chosen label, &quot;managerial market socialism,&quot; or
        for the fact that workers would have no more control over
        their work lives than they do under capitalism. And he
        concedes that what he once labeled &quot;socialist exploitation&quot; would
        persist in a coupon economy where substantial differences
        in human capital would yield substantial differences in labor incomes. &quot;I
        do not defend as just any system in which people receive wages
        proportional to their acquired skills, imprinted as the distribution of
        skill is and will be for many decades or even centuries to
        come with the weave of its ancestor, unequal
        opportunity.&quot; (Roemer, p. 118) </p>
        <p>Yet changing from capitalism to a coupon economy would
        require dispossessing the present owners of the means of
        production just as surely as changing from capitalism to
        a participatory economy with democratic workers' and
        consumers' councils, participatory planning, job complexes
        balanced for empowerment and desirability, and consumption based on
        personal sacrifice, or effort, i.e. an equitable, efficient
        economy that promotes solidarity and variety and provides workers
        and consumers with the opportunity to manage their own economic
        activities. So, presumably, the human price the U.S.
        ruling class would extract before succumbing to either
        change would be roughly comparable. To put it bluntly, given
        the strength and viciousness of the opposition that can reasonably
        be anticipated, a coupon economy isn't worth lifting two fingers
        for, much less risking one's life for. One would think someone like
        Roemer, who prides himself on being both a historical
        materialist and professional economist, would be able to apply
        cost benefit analysis to the logic of class war and see
        that the costs overwhelm the benefits of any plausible
        transition to his preferred economy--before writing two pages
        about coupon socialism, much less two books. But the academic mind
        works in mysterious ways. </p>
        <p>What would the coupon ownership system really do?
        Roemer wants to outlaw trading shares of stock for money
        or goods so those who are goods poor and/or poor in
        training/skills and other human traits that increase
        productive output will not sell off their stocks and end
        up with as little income as they have now in a few years.
        But he wants to permit trading stocks in one company for
        stocks in another to generate a market mechanism that
        will signal which companies stockholders believe will be
        more profitable and which less profitable. The problem is
        dividend rich and poor would reappear, and his coupon price signals
        would be useless window dressing in any case. </p>
        <p>Those who are luckier, more skillful, or privy to
        &quot;insider information&quot; would make more successful trades
        on the coupon stock exchange. So when the lions are done
        fleecing the lambs, not only will labor income be just as
        unequal as in capitalism, dividend or profit income in Roemer's coupon
        economy will be highly unequal as well since the poor
        will end owning shares of stock in corporate
        &quot;lemons.&quot; If this were not enough to assure
        major inequities, Roemer chastises socialists for their
        &quot;knee jerk&quot; opposition to private enterprise and assures
        us there is a significant role for privately-owned and
        managed companies in his coupon economy. To stimulate
        innovation and make sure public enterprises are subjected
        to stiff competition Roemer would encourage private
        ventures and only convert them to public enterprises by
        buying out their owners when the businesses reached substantial
        size. Unless a thankless government set buy-out prices ridiculously
        low and barred winners from reentering the entrepreneurial race
        anew, substantial &quot;capitalist&quot; income
        differentials would reappear in Roemer's coupon economy along
        with salary and dividend differentials. Not to mention
        the fact that by assuming it would be necessary to import
        a substantial dose of capitalism to breath creativity
        into his economy, Roemer hardly demonstrates much faith
        in the superiority of coupon &quot;socialism.&quot; </p>
        <p>But it is unclear why Roemer thinks the opinions of
        his coupon stockholders about the future profitability of
        companies are so valuable or important in any case. The
        actual profit differentials between companies would be a
        matter of record in his, or any version of market socialism,
        and could easily serve as the criteria for managerial
        reward and punishment. Besides, Roemer is anxious to
        staff the investment departments of his large banks with personnel
        he expects to be as knowledgeable about the business performance
        and prospects of the companies under their financial
        tutelage as the corporate management they are monitoring.
        Why would the bankers, the apex of Roemer's new power
        elite, pay heed to the uninformed speculations of small
        time stockholders--which is all coupon stock market
        prices would reflect if the value of stock portfolios
        remained more or less equal? </p>
        <p>Only if Roemer assumes that lions will eat lambs, will
        the coupon prices reflect the judgments of a relative few
        who might conceivably vie with bankers in the talent and resources
        they could bring to bear on portfolio evaluation, thereby
        successfully imitating what Roemer sees as a primary virtue
        of capitalism--large, knowledgeable capitalists rewarding
        more profitable corporations by buying their stocks and punishing
        less profitable ones by selling theirs. But assuming
        coupon stock prices are useful signals amounts to admitting
        that coupon dividends will be highly unequal. If the
        reader can forgive Roemer for confusing capitalism's ultimate
        crime for a virtue, s/he can enjoy catching Roemer trying
        to have his cake and eat it too. He suggests that mutual
        funds could become the owners of the majority of stocks--creating
        a few, large watchdogs over corporate performance--and
        citizens could own shares in the mutual funds--preserving
        egalitarian income distribution. But just as Roemer has no
        answer to the question, who would judge and control the
        big bankers?, he also has no answer to the question, who would
        judge and control the managers of the mutual funds?,
        since he wants the government out of the picture and
        small fries cannot be expected to control big enchiladas
        in either case. </p>
        <p>It is not hard to see why Roemer is schizophrenic
        about popular, democratic control over major decisions.
        He believes only highly informed elites are capable of
        making intelligent decisions. What is hard to figure is
        why he is reluctant to rely on his investment bankers to be the elite
        he can't imagine doing without, having them reward and punish corporate management
        according to the actual profit performance of enterprises.
        Because then he could dispense with coupon trading and at least
        keep coupon dividend income distribution egalitarian. Of
        course he could also dispense with coupons entirely and have
        the government issue every citizen a &quot;social
        dividend&quot; based on the productivity of the economy
        as a whole. But this is exactly what the first
        influential market socialists, Lange and Lerner, proposed
        60 years ago, leaving Roemer nothing to add to their
        proposal. Simpler still would be to just go with the
        powerful elite that has proven so successful in the real
        world survival of the fittest. I would recommend that
        strategy to Roemer, given his limited liberatory aims,
        since it also solves his otherwise insurmountable
        transition problem. </p>
        <p>What are the real implications of investment banks and
        Keiretsu? Roemer proposes bank centered conglomerates
        because he is anxious to answer critics of market
        socialism who argue that no political authority can be trusted
        to stick to &quot;economic&quot; rather than
        &quot;political&quot; criteria in evaluating, rewarding, and
        punishing enterprise and management performance. So Roemer
        proposes investment banks to make sure there is a
        &quot;hard&quot; rather than &quot;soft&quot; budget constraint
        on corporate performance. Apparently Roemer's cursory
        study of the Japanese economy has convinced him that
        bank-centered conglomerates increase the efficiency of long-run
        planning in market economies. Combined with his undisguised
        admiration for Taiwanese government strategic planning
        and French indicative planning, a clear preference for a corporatist
        rather than popular model emerges. Leaving aside whether
        or not managed capitalism will out compete more laissez
        faire capitalism in the 21st century, it is impossible to reconcile
        Roemer's second recommendation with democratic political values.
        In his attempt to answer conservative critics of the socialist project
        he replaces capitalists with investment bankers and
        mutual fund managers. Unfortunately for Roemer, it will prove
        easier for proponents of capitalism to maintain the myth
        that capitalism can be libertarian than for Roemer to
        pretend that his Keiretsu-coupon economy would not be run
        by a small, privileged economic elite. </p>
        <p>Pedantry combined with unaccustomed pretense of
        humility begins on the first page of the preface of A Future
        for Socialism: &quot;The views held by all thoughtful
        people about socialism... have necessarily been radically transformed
        by the events of the last several years.&quot; Mine haven't,
        but I am notoriously unthoughtful. In any case, Roemer continues, &quot;Because these
        events are so fresh, there is a danger that one's
        thoughts about them are also half-baked. I feel doubly
        uneasy about putting my own thoughts into print after
        such a short while: in my past writings I have preferred
        to publish only statements I could prove under sets of
        clearly stated axioms, but that approach is not possible for
        the present venture. Against these risks of publishing
        prematurely, one must balance the possible benefit of interjecting
        a different viewpoint in a vital debate while the iron is
        hot. Evidently, I have decided the expected net benefit
        is positive.&quot; Does this have the ring of sincere
        humility? </p>
        <p>In the introduction, Roemer graciously surrenders,
        posthumously, for Oscar Lange, the original proponent of
        managerial market socialism, to Friedreich Hayek, the arch-conservative
        critic of market socialism: &quot;Lange argued that what
        economists now call neoclassical price theory showed the
        possibility of combining central planning and the market, and Hayek
        retorted that planning would subvert at its heart the mechanism that
        gave capitalism its vitality. Hayek's criticisms of market
        socialism, and more recently those of Janos Kornai, are
        for the most part on the mark.&quot; No matter that
        Lange's model was, essentially, a pure market model
        without anything resembling planning, much less central planning. No
        matter that Roemer's own model reduces to a minor
        variation on Lange's model. I'm sure Lange along with
        Abba Lerner, Frederick Taylor, and other proponents of managerial
        market socialism --as well as all who have objected to
        the tautological equation of efficiency and freedom with
        free market exchange and private ownership preached by Hayek's
        disciples in the ultra-conservative Austrian school of economics--will appreciate that Roemer
        has spared them the trouble and embarrassment of running
        up their own white flag. </p>
        <p>In his chapter on &quot;Public Ownership&quot; Roemer
        freshens stale, socialist air like a bathroom deodorizing spray:
        &quot;Socialists have made a fetish of public ownership:
        public ownership has been viewed as the sine qua non of
        socialism, but this judgment is based on a false inference.&quot; What
        a relief to cut that stone from around our necks! And,
        &quot;an infinite gradation of possible property rights
        separates full, unregulated private ownership of firms...
        and complete control of a firm by a government organ.
        There is no guarantee that the state-control end of this
        spectrum is optimal.... The link between public ownership
        and socialism is tenuous, and I think one does much
        better to drop the requirement that `the people' own the means of production
        from the socialist constitution.&quot; I get it. Once
        socialists demonstrate they have come to their senses on
        this issue, it will be easier to talk to capitalists
        without them dismissing our ideas out of hand. How ingenious!
        It's a wonder nobody thought of this before. And I wonder
        if other readers will be as surprised as I to learn that:
        &quot;the widest variety of property forms became visible
        in modern capitalism, not socialism: nonprofit firms, limited-liability
        corporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, public firms, social-democratic
        property, labor-managed firms, and other forms of
        social-republican property. The property forms that will best
        further socialist goals may involve direct popular control
        or state control of the means of production in only a distant
        way.&quot; Presumably the more distant the better since Roemer
        wants control over firm management by large investment banks
        and/or mutual funds. General Douglas MacArthur identified
        Keiretsu as the social basis of Japanese fascism and
        tried (unsuccessfully) to destroy them in post-war Japan
        so U.S.-style &quot;democratic&quot; capitalism could
        flourish. Wouldn't MacArthur be surprised to find a late
        20th century American socialist trying to import Keiretsu
        into the United States to become the center piece of U.S.
        &quot;socialism?&quot; </p>
        <p>In his chapter &quot;A Brief History of Market
        Socialism&quot; Roemer manages never to mention a single
        theorist of labor-managed market socialism. Apparently
        Benjamin Ward, Evsy Domar, Branko Horvat, Jaroslav Vanek
        never wrote a worthy word on the subject of market socialism. Funny,
        many of us thought they were the banner carriers for
        market socialism for decades. Misinformed again. In any
        case, without mentioning them or their arguments, Roemer
        tells us: &quot;Contemporary models of labor-managed
        market socialism all recognize that firms must raise
        capital from non members and this would, to some unknown extent, compromise
        the autonomy of workers with regard to control of the
        firm.&quot; Roemer does not enlighten us on why the
        autonomy of stockholders is not compromised when
        capitalist firms &quot;raise capital from non
        members&quot; by selling bonds or taking out bank loans.
        But no matter. He continues: &quot;it is therefore not
        clear to what extent the managerial and labor-managed proposals
        for market socialism really differ.&quot; I think I will
        leave modern disciples of labor-managed market socialism
        like David Schweikart and Tom Weisskopf to educate Roemer
        on the difference, if they still care to. In any case,
        Roemer finishes with a refreshingly honest conclusion.
        &quot;My preference for the managerial proposals is based
        on conservatism, namely, that it is best to change
        features of a system one at a time, if possible. The
        biological metaphor is apt: an organism with one mutation is
        more likely to survive than one in which two mutations
        occur simultaneously.&quot; Thank you, John
        &quot;Darwin&quot; Roemer. That analogy certainly
        clinches the argument. </p>
        <p>I do not wish to be misinterpreted as &quot;model
        bashing&quot; in general. There are times when a formal
        model is useful to make a non-intuitive point, or settle
        a controversy. I should know, since most of my
        &quot;research&quot; work over the years has taken the
        form of searching for the simplest model adequate to
        proving a non-intuitive relationship between a set of conditions and
        consequences. And, to give him credit, Roemer has often been
        a master at deploying this device. His models in A Mathematical Analysis
        of Marxian Economics, and A General Theory of
        Exploitation and Class are well chosen to illustrate a
        number of interesting relationships between conditions
        and consequences that many political economists denied,
        or, at a minimum were unaware of. But in this case, Roemer's
        model only suggests the following conclusion and no more:
        If people start with the same stock portfolio but
        different amounts of the good, and if the poor are
        permitted to sell their shares of stock to the rich for
        goods, a relatively few rich will end up with controlling
        interest in most firms. In firms controlled by a few,
        each member of the controlling group will gain
        substantially from increased firm output, and therefore dividends,
        but will lose relatively little from the associated
        increase in production of the &quot;bad&quot; since the &quot;bad&quot;
        is public, and shared equally by the entire population. On
        the other hand, if the poor are prevented from selling
        their shares of stock for goods to the rich--which is the
        entire difference between Roemer's coupon economy and
        capitalism--most firms will be controlled by a relatively
        large number of people since nobody can acquire a large number
        of shares of stock. In this case, each member of the
        controlling group will gain only a small amount from increased
        firm output and dividends, to be weighed against the loss of living
        with an increase in the public bad. So, Roemer predicts
        lower levels of output and public bads in a MSPEE than in
        a CPEE--if you remember his cryptography--because MSPEE
        citizens would vote for higher anti-pollution standards than
        CPEE citizens in a democratic political process. </p>
        <p>Unlike most of Roemer's formal model building, the
        model he constructs to suggest this conclusion is pure pedantic
        obfuscation. It is completely unnecessary to make the
        point. Worse still, it doesn't even prove the point.
        Roemer admits &quot;All this is conjecture, for the general-equilibrium effects
        can be complicated. The only way to be sure what welfare
        will be in equilibrium is to prove a theorem.... I have
        no general theorems at this time.&quot; In other words,
        all he has done with the model, so far, is perform some
        illustrative calculations, based on particular choices
        for functions and parameters. He has not proved that his conclusion would follow
        under different and no-less-reasonable choices for
        functions and parameters. Which makes his entire model
        and the elaborate table presenting the results of his calculations
        on pages 70 and 71 no more compelling than my verbal summary
        of the logic he predicts. I have no doubt he, or one of
        his graduate students will succeed in proving some general
        theorems based on the model sooner or later. After all,
        where else can dissertations come from? But until then,
        &quot;half-baked&quot; is a phrase that comes to mind. Moreover,
        no sensible person would require such a model, with theorems,
        to convince him or her of what is hardly a non-intuitive point. </p>
        <p>It is fascinating how fast a tactical retreat urged on
        us by our academic fellow travelers turns into a complete
        rout. In response to the collapse of communism some
        self-styled radical economists at the Socialist Scholars Conference
        in New York five years ago argued that market &quot;rejectionism&quot;
        should be reconsidered, and perhaps markets could be a useful
        part of a socialist economy provided they were properly &quot;socialized,&quot;
        to use a phrase coined by Diane Elson. Now Roemer is congratulated
        by the likes of Samuel Bowles and Erik Olin Wright for admitting
        that Lange was wrong and Hayek was right, for pointing
        out that the only corrective needed to free market
        allocations is indicative planning modeled on Japanese Keiretsu
        and MITI, German investment banks, and investment
        planning in Taiwan, for over throwing capitalism by
        making every citizen a capitalist--everyone must play the coupon market
        poker game and you can't even cash out--and for chastising socialists
        for demonizing private ownership and fetishizing public ownership.
        Market socialists have, indeed, &quot;come a long way, baby.&quot; </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><em>Mark Chen </em></font></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><em></em></font>&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>On September 9 there appeared on the Cypherpunks' Internet
        mailing list a short piece of computer source code purporting
        to be RSA Data Security's secret RC4 cipher algorithm. RC4
        is one of the most widely used commercial ciphers, but
        its internals have for years been a guarded trade
        secret--a status that changed within hours, as the program
        fragment, which simple tests revealed to be the genuine
        article, traversed the farthest corners of the Net via e-mail,
        bulletin boards, and file transfer. State Department export
        regulations, as well as intellectual property laws, were
        smoothly rendered moot. As Cypherpunk founder Tim May says,
        &quot;National borders are just speed bumps on the
        information superhighway.&quot; </p>
        <p>Soon after RC4 hit the Net, RSA Data Security (RSADSI) issued
        a statement that read in part: &quot;It has come to RSA Data
        Security's attention that certain RSA trade secrets, in the
        form of confidential and proprietary source code, have been
        misappropriated and disclosed...&quot; </p>
        <p>... Not only is this act a violation of law, but its
        publication is a gross abuse of the Internet. RSA has begun
        an investigation and will proceed with legal action
        against anyone found to have violated its intellectual
        property rights.&quot; </p>
        <p>Setting aside the questionable legal basis of these
        threats, why doesn't RSADSI bring charges against the person
        who originally released the code? The answer is they
        don't know who did it. The code was distributed through a mechanism
        called a &quot;mailing list,&quot; a system that distributes e-mail
        to people who have signed up to receive messages on a
        given topic. For example, if you were interested in fish,
        you might sign up for an aquarium hobbyists' list. People
        could then send e-mail to the list server, and the e-mail
        would be forwarded to everyone on the list. RC4 was
        posted to the Cypherpunks' &quot;anonymous remailers,&quot; list.
        When an anonymous remailer receives a message, it strips
        off all of the sender information and remails the message
        under an anonymous pseudonym. This effectively breaks the
        link between sender and recipients, and makes tracing
        impossible. </p>
        <p>The intended purpose of these remailers is to allow
        free distribution of various intellectual &quot;commodities,&quot;
        whose distribution is ordinarily discouraged by law or
        custom. A Cypherpunk faction called the Information
        Liberation Front has long used anonymous remailing to
        distribute inaccessible, expensive, copyrighted
        literature. Moreover, the remailers serve as
        technological guarantee of the right to free speech. They
        allow unpopular opinions to be voiced, while protecting
        the authors of those opinions from retribution. </p>
        <p>Far from being a &quot;gross abuse of the
        Internet,&quot; as RSADSI maintains, the distribution of
        RC4 was a case of the Internet doing what it does
        best--propagating ideas. While this act may or may not
        have been a violation of human-made laws, it was a
        faithful exercise of the natural laws of information
        flow, as expressed by Thomas Jefferson, parent of the
        American patent system, in an August 13, 1813 letter to Isaac
        McPherson: &quot;If nature has made any one thing less
        susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is
        the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an
        individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it
        to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces
        itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot
        dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is
        that no one possesses the less, because every other
        possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from
        me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine;
        as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening
        me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another
        over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of
        man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been
        peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she
        made them, like fire, expandable over all space, without lessening
        their density at any point, and like the air in which we
        breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement
        or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in
        nature, be a subject of property.&quot; </p>
        <p>So to the dismay of RSADSI and many others, 21st
        century technology is catching up to Thomas Jefferson's
        18th century natural philosophy, and turning
        &quot;intellectual property&quot; into an oxymoron. The question
        of &quot;What can be done?&quot; about truly unrestricted
        free speech--that is, the freedom to distribute any intellectual
        products at all, including those that supposedly &quot;belong&quot;
        to someone else--is a matter of controversy. </p>
        <p>The fear among the commissars is that the force of Jefferson's
        laws of infodynamics may well prove to be absolute. This
        fear is so profound that the Administration's techno-evangelists
        are still in a state of denial--a fact well-illustrated
        by the Information Infrastructure Task Force's extraordinary
        150-page draft report on &quot;Intellectual Property and
        the National Information Infrastructure.&quot; Beginning
        with the Panglossian assertion that &quot;with no more
        than minor clarification and amendment, the Copyright
        Act, like the Patent Act, will provide the necessary
        protection of rights&quot; on the Infobahn, the report goes
        on to make various pronouncements on how intellectual
        &quot;property&quot; is to be defended technologically--none
        of which can withstand cursory inspection by any engineer
        with more intelligence than a bivalve. Sensing, perhaps, the
        dearth of substance in their work, the authors quickly
        move on to discuss more practical matters. First, some
        moral training: &quot;There seems to be an attitude by
        some on the Internet...that you check your copyright at
        the door when you enter that domain. There is a general
        lack of awareness...about intellectual property.&quot; </p>
        <p>And such a deplorable circumstance obviously calls for
        a massive program of indoctrination: &quot;Effective education
        of the public about intellectual property rights is crucial....Therefore,
        the principles of intellectual property law must be
        taught in our schools and libraries.&quot; </p>
        <p>And it goes downhill from there. </p>
        <p>While this official pabulum may frighten laypersons (lacking,
        as we do, the moral fiber afforded by a proper education
        in intellectual property law), it must be conceded that desperate
        times call for desperate measures. What is a government
        to do? Suppose, for example, that to put an end to the
        kind of hanky-panky that allowed the release of RC4, Congress
        decided to outlaw anonymous remailers. Well, then, what
        about the ones overseas? Any computer attached to the
        Internet is just as accessible as any other; neither
        national borders nor geographical distances make a whit
        of difference. It might further propose that the NSA
        monitor all overseas traffic and have the FBI visit
        anyone who transmits items from a stipulated verboten
        list. This, too, fails because unbreakable cryptography
        is now widely available, and would render such
        transmissions opaque even to the NSA. Okay, then, let's suppose
        that we prohibit transmission of encrypted data
        altogether. Unfortunately, encrypted data can be made virtually
        impossible to detect. Through a technique called &quot;steganography,&quot; encrypted
        messages can be imbedded in other, normal-looking data so
        that they appear to be nothing more than, say, graphics
        or audio files. And as a further complication, a
        technology called &quot;DC-nets&quot; (invented by David
        Chaum) now enables people to create anonymous messages
        that are mathematically impossible to trace--with or
        without remailers. Practical implementations of this technology
        have not yet been devised, but they are not far off. </p>
        <p>Some analysts are now advocating a scheme called &quot;superdistribution,&quot;
        based on the premise that while it is difficult to
        control software's duplication, it is easy to control its
        behavior. It implicitly recognizes that past attempts at
        control have been dismal failures, due largely to the fact
        that they tried to treat ideas like physical goods. So in
        stark contrast to such silly measures as copy protection,
        superdistribution encourages aggressive, free dissemination
        of software. Control happens not at the point of
        duplication, but at the point of use. The user may freely obtain
        a program from a bulletin board, a public file server, or e-mail;
        but when they run it, the program requests payment in
        order to function. </p>
        <p>Various mechanisms have been proposed for enabling
        this &quot;revenue collection,&quot; ranging from specialized hardware that
        accumulates usage fees for monthly billing (like a gas meter)
        to on-the-spot digital cash payment via e-mail. Whether
        or not computer users are ultimately willing to submit to
        such a regimen of capitalist genuflection is an open
        question; but the fact that these solutions are being proposed underscores
        the magnitude of the problem. </p>
        <p>It is impossible to judge what shape an eventual
        solution will take. Schemes like superdistribution apply only
        to binary programs, not source code, and as yet, no one
        has made even a plausible conjecture about how to
        regulate static data like text or artwork. What is clear
        is that some of the fundamental assumptions of
        capitalism, like the relationship of supply to demand,
        cannot survive in cyberspace without drastic modification.
        In the words of John Perry Barlow: &quot;Notions of
        property, value, ownership, and the nature of wealth
        itself are changing more fundamentally than at any time
        since the Sumerians first poked cuneiform into wet clay
        and called it stored grain. Only a very few people are
        aware of the enormity of this shift, and fewer of them
        are lawyers or public officials.&quot; </p>
        <p>In today's virtual world, property cannot be bolted
        down and speech cannot be curtailed. The Espionage Act
        cannot enforce obedience; employers cannot
        &quot;discipline&quot; employees for complaining about management
        ineptitude or paternalism. There is no identifiable
        author to throw in jail or to fire. There is no press to
        shut down. </p>
        <p>These facts have direct implications for our existing system
        of ideological hegemony. On September 1, for instance,
        NBC aired a &quot;Dateline&quot; segment (demurely entitled
        &quot;Dial in for Mayhem&quot;) about peripatetic youths who
        had lost fingers while trying to follow pyrotechnic recipes
        from terrorist manuals found on computer bulletin boards.
        Viewers were treated to the spectacle of Deborah Roberts
        expressing shock and dismay at the easy accessibility of such
        titles as Anarchy for Fun and Profit and Uncle Fester's
        Home Workshop Explosives. The segment closed with
        Congressman Ed Markey fuming, &quot;This is an open network
        that sends sewage...into the homes and minds of children
        without any safeguards whatsoever....We are now going to
        have to construct a new set of laws to give parents the
        power they need to protect their children,&quot; thus
        deftly adapting the NSA's &quot;pederast in the
        computer&quot; argument (featured recently in the Clipper Chip
        debate) to our newest national security threat. </p>
        <p>The message? Knowledge can kill, folks, so be sure to
        get yours from a licensed retailer </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Big Story here in Cleveland, page one of the Plain
        Dealer, repeated with furrowed brows on all the newscasts:
        The Browns (a football team, not a slang term for the
        Wise Use movement) are threatening to blow town for St.
        Louis or Baltimore if the taxpayers don't fork up some gigabucks
        to put shag rug on the goal posts. Here we go again. This
        is after the good Clevo working folk delivered over $300
        million in small unmarked bills to the real estate billionaire Jacobs
        Brothers to keep our beloved baseball Indians from losing
        their hundred games a year in St. Petersburg. </p>
        <p>The result? A state-of-the-art baseball/basketball
        Athletic Complex (which describes our psychological affliction
        nicely): big shiny scoreboards; big shiny racist Chief
        Wahoo logos ten feet high; big shiny multi-tiered
        restaurants so the big shiny ad execs eating $100 dinners can look
        down at the proles in their twice-as-expensive-as-last-year
        seats drinking $3 beers; even a big shiny underground
        passageway to the downtown train terminal so suburbanites won't
        soil themselves by actual contact with the city folk above. </p>
        <p>They call it &quot;Gateway.&quot; </p>
        <p>Um<193>Gateway to what, exactly? This is Cleveland, people.
        Cleveland hasn't been a gateway to anything since the
        Louisiana Purchase. </p>
        <p>Well, yeah, there's a bit of the Clevo skyline visible
        past the outfield. A couple of smallish office buildings.
        Whoopee. Gateway to Amway. </p>
        <p>But there's a reason the stadium's pointed in that
        direction. It's also walking distance from closed-down factories
        on the third base side and some of the poorest
        neighborhoods in the midwest behind the first base line. </p>
        <p>In truth, the stadium is a Gateway, as from one world
        to another--them what gots on the inside, them what don'ts
        on the out. It's the Gateway to the Supercapitalist
        future, as the shrinking middle class, thoroughly propagandized
        on the virtue of unfettered private gain, gladly amuses itself
        by financing the richest segments of society while
        literally, physically turning their backs on all who
        represent the system's failures. </p>
        <p>Tradition. That's what baseball's all about. </p>
        <p>Even the names of the individual facilities fairly
        drip with greed. The baseball park has been dubbed Jacobs
        Field, modestly enough, but only because they couldn't
        find a corporation willing to drop $20 million to buy the
        name as ad space; if the cash was right, Clevelanders might
        be watching ballgames at K-Mart Park, the Spam Palace, or
        the Clapper Dome. (This last would really be cool during
        night games.) Likewise, the Cavaliers' new basketball facility
        is named for their owners, the Gund brothers. The result is,
        um, unfortunate: Gund Arena. </p>
        <p>Say it a few times rapidly and you'll see the problem.
        Go on, I'll wait. See? Isn't that great? </p>
        <p>The inevitable radio ads are outstanding. &quot;Gund
        Arena. Be where the action is.&quot; &quot;Gund Arena's
        great for the whole family.&quot; And the apparently-related,
        &quot;Cavs Fever-Catch it.&quot; The Family Values crowd must
        not monitor sports radio. At the first exhibition, the PA
        announcer welcomed the crowd to &quot;your new Gund Arena.&quot;
        I wouldn't know whether to applaud or take an antibiotic. </p>
        <p>The name is only temporary until the team is sold to
        the Painful Rectal Inflammation family of Akron. </p>
        <p>So, anyway, with a gift from the citizens in excess of
        $400 million (including cost overruns and miscellaneous
        perks), how did the bazillionaires of baseball respond?
        By fielding the best Cleveland baseball team since you
        could buy a Cuban cigar--in fact, the only one not to suck
        that I'm personally old enough to have witnessed. By
        raking in record amounts of cash from sellout crowds
        night after night. By receiving the most joyful
        enthusiasm this grim village has generated in memory,
        loyal adoration almost intense enough to cause one to
        look away from the massive boondoggle. And then, by
        stopping. </p>
        <p>By not even having the decency to play out their first
        full season. Because they weren't making enough money.
        The bastards. </p>
        <p>So will we learn anything from all this? Not hardly. </p>
        <p>As to the park itself, I can't imagine a greater
        symbol of the extent to which politics has become simply
        a profit machine greased by childish thinking. </p>
        <p>Right at the junction of Interstates 90 and 70--come
        and see--stands a nicely-shaped piece of metal that cost
        roughly a half a billion bucks. From our pockets. Empty,
        because the guys who own it are pissed that they're not
        richer. </p>
        <p>And the Chamber of Commerce points to it with pride.
        Duh. </p>
        <p>We've got Gateway, everybody, and the Rock and Roll
        Hall of Fame (don't get me started on that now), and to
        watch the hair and teeth on the evening news here you'd
        swear they think all this just might make the city's
        intolerable segregation, poverty, and infant mortality
        rate somehow magically disappear. </p>
        <p>Half a billion bucks. Hell, we could have had a
        Stealth fighter for that kind of money. (And wouldn't
        that be cool in the playoffs? We'd kick Chicago's ass.)
        And now, no shock, Browns owner Art Modell, who is constantly
        portrayed in this town as being among the least greedy of NFL owners--which
        is a bit like calling Savonarola one of the nicest members of
        the Inquisition--says that if we don't give him and the Browns
        a similar blowjob, he just might have to find a town that
        will. </p>
        <p>What happens? Do the citizens of Cleveland go and find
        this guy, line up single file, and begin just slapping
        him over and over and over? You want what? (Slap.) $200
        million? (Slap.) Or else<193>you'll just leave? (Slap. Slap.
        Slap.) Oh, nooooo. (Sarcastic laughter, enthusiastic slapping.
        Line extends to Ashtabula.) </p>
        <p>No. Instead, the mayor, Mike White, mounts a soapbox
        on his knees, spouting the standard delusional economic
        theories about how paying some rich guy hundreds of
        millions of dollars to host eight football games a year
        will somehow revitalize the economic lives of the folks on East 105th
        Street. </p>
        <p>Worse, the city's bigshots aren't stopping with the
        Browns. No, there's enough money to be taken this way they're
        coming positively unhinged. Heck, let's build new hotels,
        and a new Convention Center, and even a Casino on Lake
        Erie. Sure, bigshots from Singapore are just dying to visit
        Ohio in February to play blackjack until dawn. </p>
        <p>That's what I call a responsible economic plan. And
        people are falling for it. </p>
        <p>Grow up, Cleveland. Let the Browns go. Turn the old
        stadium into the Sacred Shrine to the Severed Head of
        Bernie Kosar. Spend your money on the neighborhoods--pass
        some school levies, people--and your Sundays with your
        families (you know, those people in the house who never
        seem to leave). </p>
        <p>Set an example for the rest of America. In a real
        Major League City, the hopes of the citizens depend not on
        who's playing today, but who's working tomorrow. </p>
        <p><em>Bob Harris is a comic, and does a progressive TV

<p><em>The following is meant solely to indicate the kinds of materials available via the online 
school. There will be a large expansion of offerings for the Fall 1996 semester.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3>Course Catalog</h3>
<h2>Semester 1: February 1995</h2>
<hr>
<h3>U.S. FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Noam Chomsky &amp; Stephen R. Shalom</strong> </p>
<p>There is a mainstream consensus on U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War which fails in one 
crucial respect: it is utterly false--false as description and false as explanation. This course will 
provide an alternative analysis of U.S. foreign policy since World War II, trying to illuminate 
the actual record and the ways in which policy has been rooted in the structures of U.S. society. 
The examination of the historical patterns should facilitate understanding of current-day policies 
and those we can expect in the future. Topics to be covered will include U.S.-Soviet contention, 
Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Middle East, Central America, and the end of the Cold 
War, the Gulf War, Somalia, and Haiti. Readings will be provided online. </p>
<hr>
<h3>TIME, WORK, AND MONEY: U.S. CONSUMERISM </h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Juliet Schor</strong> </p>
<p>Consumerism has found fertile ground in the United States: malls are now the main public space, 
commercials saturate our culture, and kids kill for sneakers. Savings rates have been falling and 
millions of American are deeply in debt. In this course we will take a critical look at 
consumerism, trying to understand where it came from, where it's headed, and how people are 
resisting it. </p>
<p>We will explore the various contexts of consumer society: its history; connections to work, 
including the &quot;work and spend&quot; cycle; time use and consumerism; social processes such as 
&quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;; consumption and addiction; the environmental impacts of 
consumerism; the globalization of consumer culture; and anti-consumerist movements. The 
course will draw on economics, sociology, history, and other fields. </p>
<hr>
<h3>CONCEPTUALIZING A BETTER ECONOMY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Michael Albert</strong> </p>
<p>People opposed to exploitation, alienation, ecological degradation and the many other ills that 
characterize contemporary economic life are often asked--OK, so what are you for? This course 
is devoted to developing answers to this question. We will not present a set of answers, fait 
accompli. We will instead together develop the conceptual tools and insights prerequisite to 
developing answers, only later using these to develop and evaluate some competing models for 
what a better economy might be like. Along the way we will develop a participatory economic 
vision and evaluate social democratic as well as market and centrally planned post capitalist 
alternatives. </p>
<hr>
<h3>INTRO TO POLITICAL ECONOMY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Robin Hahnel</strong> </p>
<p>What is economic activity? Economic efficiency? What types of economic institutions exist and 
what are their effects? What are classes and how do they affect societies and economies? How 
do individual capitalist economies differ: U.S., Swedish, Japanese, French. What are the 
defining features of non-capitalist economies (Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia)? 
How do markets work? How do we evaluate them? How do they impact on the ecology, on 
people's lives and development? What is going on when the U.S. government uses fiscal and 
monetary policies to influence the economy? What social and economic motives are at work in 
debates about health care, full employment, welfare, etc. and in efforts to affect interest rates, 
employment levels and other economic indices? How do trade and foreign investment affect 
economies? These and other issues having to do with contemporary economic life will be our 
focus. </p>
<hr>
<h3>ELECTRONIC ACTIVISM ON THE INTERNET </h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Harel Barzilai</strong></p>
<p>In this course students use the Internet as a tool with which to explore this very medium. We 
explore the Internet as a communication and information resource generally, and as a tool for 
`electronic activism' in particular. Participants learn about email, automated email-servers, 
mailing lists and list-servers, the UseNet (the world's largest bulletin board system) ftp, gopher, 
telnet, the world wide web, and more. Homework exercises (optional, of course) allow 
participants to make this as 'hands-on' an experience as they choose. </p>
<p>In addition to learning the 'tools of the trade' of electronic activism, we compare and discuss 
their relative advantages and disadvantages for everything from coalition-building to electronic 
leafleting. We also explore the &quot;online culture&quot;, especially on the noncommercial and 
quasi-anarchic UseNet, including how UseNet and the radical &quot;GNU&quot; project have provided, 
online, living proof of the power of cooperative rather than competitive economics.</p>
<p>We conclude by discussing the tremendous potentials, as well as pitfalls, ahead of us on the 
`information super-highway' -- from privatization and commercialization, to the great potential 
of democratizing the airwaves through internet 'virtual broadcasting' radio (and eventually TV) 
stations beaming left/activist programs directly into America's homes. </p>

<h3>Course Catalog</h3>
<h2>Semester 2: June 1995</h2>
<hr>
<h3>U.S. FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Noam Chomsky &amp; Stephen R. Shalom</strong> </p>
<p>There is a mainstream consensus on U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War which fails in one 
crucial respect: it is utterly false--false as description and false as explanation. This course will 
provide an alternative analysis of U.S. foreign policy since World War II, trying to illuminate 
the actual record and the ways in which policy has been rooted in the structures of U.S. society. 
The examination of the historical patterns should facilitate understanding of current-day policies 
and those we can expect in the future. Topics to be covered will include U.S.-Soviet contention, 
Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Middle East, Central America, and the end of the Cold 
War, the Gulf War, Somalia, and Haiti. Readings will be provided online. </p>
<hr>
<h3>TIME, WORK, AND MONEY: U.S. CONSUMERISM </h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Juliet Schor</strong> </p>
<p>Consumerism has found fertile ground in the United States: malls are now the main public space, 
commercials saturate our culture, and kids kill for sneakers. Savings rates have been falling and 
millions of American are deeply in debt. In this course we will take a critical look at 
consumerism, trying to understand where it came from, where it's headed, and how people are 
resisting it. </p>
<p>We will explore the various contexts of consumer society: its history; connections to work, 
including the &quot;work and spend&quot; cycle; time use and consumerism; social processes such as 
&quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;; consumption and addiction; the environmental impacts of 
consumerism; the globalization of consumer culture; and anti-consumerist movements. The 
course will draw on economics, sociology, history, and other fields. </p>
<hr>
<h3>CONCEPTUALIZING A BETTER ECONOMY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Michael Albert</strong> </p>
<p>People opposed to exploitation, alienation, ecological degradation and the many other ills that 
characterize contemporary economic life are often asked--OK, so what are you for? This course 
is devoted to developing answers to this question. We will not present a set of answers, fait 
accompli. We will instead together develop the conceptual tools and insights prerequisite to 
developing answers, only later using these to develop and evaluate some competing models for 
what a better economy might be like. Along the way we will develop a participatory economic 
vision and evaluate social democratic as well as market and centrally planned post capitalist 
alternatives. </p>
<hr>
<h3>INTRO TO POLITICAL ECONOMY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Robin Hahnel</strong> </p>
<p>What is economic activity? Economic efficiency? What types of economic institutions exist and 
what are their effects? What are classes and how do they affect societies and economies? How 
do individual capitalist economies differ: U.S., Swedish, Japanese, French. What are the 
defining features of non-capitalist economies (Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia)? 
How do markets work? How do we evaluate them? How do they impact on the ecology, on 
people's lives and development? What is going on when the U.S. government uses fiscal and 
monetary policies to influence the economy? What social and economic motives are at work in 
debates about health care, full employment, welfare, etc. and in efforts to affect interest rates, 
employment levels and other economic indices? How do trade and foreign investment affect 
economies? These and other issues having to do with contemporary economic life will be our 
focus. </p>
<h3>A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE U.S.</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Howard Zinn</strong> </p>
<p>This course will be based on a reading of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United 
States, and a dialogue with the author. As Zinn writes in the introductory chapter. &quot;...in that 
inevitable taking of sides which comes from selection and emphasis in history, I prefer to try to 
tell the story of the discovery of America from the viewpoint of the Arawaks, of the Constitution 
from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War 
as seen by the New York Irish, of the Mexican War as seen by the deserting soldiers of Scott's 
army, of the rise of industrialism as seen by the young women in the Lowell textile mills, of the 
Spanish-American War as seen by the Cubans, the conquest of the Philippines as seen by black 
soldiers on Luzon, the Gilded Age as seen by southern farmers, the First World War as seen by 
socialists, the Second World War as seen by pacifists, the New Deal as seen by blacks in 
Harlem, the postwar American empire as seen by Peons in Latin America.</p>
<hr>
<h3>ELECTRONIC ACTIVISM ON THE INTERNET </h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Harel Barzilai</strong></p>
<p>In this course students use the Internet as a tool with which to explore this very medium. We 
explore the Internet as a communication and information resource generally, and as a tool for 
`electronic activism' in particular. Participants learn about email, automated email-servers, 
mailing lists and list-servers, the UseNet (the world's largest bulletin board system) ftp, gopher, 
telnet, the world wide web, and more. Homework exercises (optional, of course) allow 
participants to make this as 'hands-on' an experience as they choose. </p>
<p>In addition to learning the 'tools of the trade' of electronic activism, we compare and discuss 
their relative advantages and disadvantages for everything from coalition-building to electronic 
leafleting. We also explore the &quot;online culture&quot;, especially on the noncommercial and 
quasi-anarchic UseNet, including how UseNet and the radical &quot;GNU&quot; project have provided, 
online, living proof of the power of cooperative rather than competitive economics.</p>
<p>We conclude by discussing the tremendous potentials, as well as pitfalls, ahead of us on the 
`information super-highway' -- from privatization and commercialization, to the great potential 
of democratizing the airwaves through internet 'virtual broadcasting' radio (and eventually TV) 
stations beaming left/activist programs directly into America's homes. </p>

<h2>A. Getting Started</h2>

<p>The idea of this course is a bit unusual. We are not only
trying to develop our understanding of particular existing
economic visions, which would be fine all by itself. We also want
to develop an ability to think about and create economic vision,
more or less from scratch, on our own.</p>

<p>Here is the tentative outline of lecture topics. They may
change somewhat in light of interests, the pace the course
actually goes at, etc. (Notice, the outline doesn't give away too
much of the plot...)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction: What is an economy and what aims might we
        have for an economy </li>

<h2>B. What is this course's purpose?</h2>

<p>As some of you likely know, I &quot;thought up&quot; (with

develop an ability to judge these systems and even to think up
adaptations or entirely different models. </p>

<p>Therefore the aim of the course is to learn how to conceive of

<h2>B. What is this course's purpose?</h2>

<p>As some of you likely know, I thought up (with Robin Hahnel)
the vision called Participatory Economics. Part of the aim of the
course is to understand it, and also the visions called
&quot;market socialism,&quot; and centrally planned
socialism.&quot; But what I am also hoping is that we will
develop an ability to judge these systems and even to think up
adaptations or entirely different models. </p>

<p>Therefore the aim of the course is to learn how to conceive of
an economic vision, to learn about a few (and one in particular),
and to develop an ability to judge economies and economic
visions. </p>

<h2>C. The Mechanics of the Course</h2>

<p>To even begin to accomplish these ends as a first, preliminary
step, we have to know (a) what is an economy, (b) what aims do we
want an economy (our economic vision) to accomplish.</p>

<p>Knowing (a) what an economy is tells us what we have to
describe and explain in order to have described and explained an
economic vision. Knowing (b) what aims we have for economic life
and activity tells us what characteristics and qualities we have
to build into the economy we favor.</p>

<p>Before getting to these introductory issues, however--and they
are the main focus of this first lecture and do set a foundation
for much that follows--let's do a little introducing--and
scene-setting.</p>

<p>Each week I will post a lecture. I am going to try to be
conversational and clear, but not simplistic. Each lecture will
take us part way to where I want the class to be by the time of
the next lecture, but not all the way. Getting the rest of the
way is going to require some work on everyone's part during the
subsequent week. After all, you can't learn new ways of thinking
and evaluating without some practice. To facilitate
participation, in each lecture I will ask a bunch of questions.
Settling on answers will get us where we need to be for the
subsequent lecture. </p>

<p>During the week following each lecture I hope many of you will
react to what I have offered, ask questions about whatever you
find confusing, suggest improvements to anything you think is
inadequate, raise related issues that interest you, and also, as
a priority, try to provide answers to the questions I raise
preparatory to delivering the next lecture. (The best way to do
that, by the way, is to compose your answer after reading the
lecture, but independently of other people's answers. The more
independent answers we get to questions, up to a point, the
better.) In any event, answers to the questions I ask are going
to be needed in order to proceed with the next lecture.</p>

<p>Sometimes questions I raise will have many viable answers.
Other times, there may be one right answer. During each week I
will try to relate to everyone's comments and questions and I
will certainly relate to answers to the questions I offer in the
lectures, prodding until we get what we need to continue the next
week.</p>

<p>You can send me EMail if you would like to communicate in
private. And I may send a message or two privately as well. The
fact is, I have no more experience teaching a class this way than
any (most?) of you have taking one this way. We are going to
learn the limits and assets of this approach together. The main
thing, I think, is when you have a question ask it, when you
disagree about something put your different view forward, and
let's all remember this is a learning experience, not a shoot-out
at the OK Corral. There actually aren't going to be all that many
of us--probably about twenty or so, so it ought to be quite
manageable.</p>

<p>As one &quot;assignment&quot; for this first week, finally,
could each student write a brief personal message, briefly
describing yourself and your prior knowledge or lack of knowledge
in the field, indicating your reasons for taking this course. A
little background about each student will be good, I think, to
help us interact and also to help me prepare lectures.</p>

<h2>(I) What is an Economy?</h2>

<p>How the hell do we answer a question like this? I suppose we
could go look it up somewhere, but the idea in this course is to
create our own answers, not to go find and repeat someone elses.</p>

<p>So, how about if we take it a step at a time. What happens in
an economy? </p>

<p>Well, people consume and produce things. So let's start with
that: an economy is the set of institutions that facilitate and
organize people producing and consuming things. </p>

<p>What then is production, what is consumption, what is an
institution, and what does &quot;facilitate and organize&quot;
mean?</p>

<h3>Production:</h3>

<p>Well, regarding production, when it happens something new
generally emerges. And, it doesn't emerge from nothing, but from
stuff that is combined together in the act of production. So we
have inputs to production and outputs from it. The inputs are
combined, the outputs are the result. The action undertaked in
the middle, is called work. The places where this happens we will
call workplaces. </p>

<p>Okay, so what are the inputs and what are the outputs of
typical production processes?</p>

<p>This is the first question that we need to answer to be ready
for lecture two. (I'll get you started. Answer for an auto plant.
One thing that goes in is rubber. One that comes out is a Honda.
But there is much more...) But let's do it &quot;in class&quot;
during the week. For now, let's just go on as if we already had
the answer. You might want to think about it, before
continuing...and I hope many of you will answer it, in your own
way, in messages, before you read other people's posts, as part
of your first reaction this coming week.</p>

<p>Next, knowing what the inputs and outputs of production are,
how do we describe workplaces? They are institutions you might
say. Fine. But what is that? What is the critical attribute that
defines institutions, and that distinguishes one from another? </p>

<p>Is it the floorplan? Is it the size of the building, or even
the existence of a building? Is it the speed things happen at?
The quality of the results? These characteristics are important,
but not at the heart of the matter, I think we can agree. Then
what?</p>

<p>Well, we know that there is something similar that is
profoundly important, about, say, GM, Microsoft, and the local
cannery. This is what we want to get a grip on. And it isn't
their size, their products, their buildings, their locales. They
have almost nothing in common on these axes. What they share is
instead something about the relations that exist, day in and day
out, among the actors who get together in these institutions.
Something about their motivations, interests, behaviours, and
choices. This is what we really mean, it seems to me, when we
refer to an institution.</p>

<p>So how about if we say that an institution is a collection of
social roles (plus some infrastructure and perhaps equipment, and
the people who fill the roles). By social roles we mean things
like union steward, mother, judge, manager, CEO, owner, worker.
Then, the critical things that is similar about the businesses
mentioned above, all of which are capitalist, is that they all
embody the same basic defining role structures. In different
economies it follows that we will have qualitatively different
types of economic institutions due to their having qualitatively
different role structures.</p>

<p>So, in any economy, we have workplaces which have role
structures and in which production takes place. There are inputs
and outputs. If we are going to define an economic vision, part
of the job will be defining these production institutions, and
particularly their role structures.</p>

<p>What are the primary roles within capitalist workplaces? </p>

<p>Is a public school a workplace, a GM factory, a family? Why or
why not?</p>

<h3>Consumption:</h3>

<p>Now we have something to go with. One important part of the
art of doing theoretical work, of understanding some domain or
envisioning one, is to develop concepts and then build on them,
only adding new ones when they are really needed. We have defined
one type of economic activity, production. We have said it has
inputs and outputs (which we will describe this week) and we have
said that it is carried out in production institutions, which we
call workplaces, and that these have role structures (that we
will also address during the week in our messages) that are what
give them their defining features.</p>

<p>So what about consumption? Well, we immediately know that it
is another economic activity. It too has inputs and outputs. It
too is carried out in context of institutions, and we can call
them consumption institutions. And they too have role structures.</p>

<p>And now we have some more questions we need to deal with
during this coming week:</p>

<p>What are the inputs and outputs of consumption activity? </p>

<p>What distinguishes consumption activity from production
activity? </p>

<p>What are some consumption activity roles?</p>

<p>Is a factory, a school, a family a consumption institution?
Why or why not? </p>

<h3>Allocation:</h3>

<p>Now we return to the sticky question of facilitating and
organizing the economic activities production and consumption.
What does this entail?</p>

<p>Well, we know that there are a whole lot of people consuming
and producing, and we know that there are a whole lot of places
where all this activity goes on. Allocation is the name we give
for the institutions by which and through which it is determined
what the inputs and outputs of the economy's activities will be
and where they will wind up.</p>

<p>In each production institution, what is produced, how much,
with what steps, by whom? For each person and group of people,
what is consumed, how much, and how is it gotten? How does what
is produced come to match what is sought for consumption and vice
versa. How do outputs match up with inputs?</p>

<p>The market is an allocation institution. And so is a central
planning apparatus. And we might dream up some others as well,
including say, decentralizing the economy into little separate
self-sufficient units so that allocation is carried on entirely
as a face-to-face exchange.</p>

<p>Once we think of markets as an institution we know that we
need to describe the associated role structure. Likewise if we
think of central planning this way, again, we have to describe
the roles that are associated with central planning. For markets
we have buyers and sellers. There may be other refinements in a
particular market economy, but we could go a long way toward
figuring out the defining features of markets if we revealed the
motivations and behaviors of these buyers and sellers and how
their behaviors combine to influence allocation. For central
planning we have order givers (planners) and order takers
(workers)...</p>

<p>And, likewise, for any economic vision we will need to do the
same thing, describe the allocation institution in terms of the
roles that it defines for economic actors and the ensuing
dynamics and processes and their implications for who does what,
who gets what, etc.</p>

<p>What is investment and what does it have to do with
allocation?</p>

<p>In a market economy, what determines how much of the product
each actor gets?</p>

<p>And what determines, in a market economy, how much work each
actor does? </p>

<p>So to define an economy we need to define production,
consumption, and allocation institutions that work successfully
together. That will be our goal. But, of course, not just any
such institutions. We want ones that have qualities we like.</p>

<h2>(II) Evaluating an Economy, and our Aims</h2>

<p>Economies affect people. This is pretty obvious, but important
to understand in a bit more detail. They influence what we do (by
providing roles we have to fill) and what we get from the
productive output (by allocations outcomes). These two facts in
turn have much to do with our possible life stories. Are we doing
interesting or boring things at work? Do we have power over our
circumstances or are we bossed around by others? Do we starve,
get by, or enjoy luxury. What happens to our personalities and
potentials in the work we do and consuming we opt for? And so on.</p>

<p>Evaluating an economy means asking how do its institutions
affect people? What are the built-in implications for people's
lives of the economy's production, consumption, and allocation
institutions/roles when they are operating as they are meant to?
If the economy propels anti-social attitudes or distorts and
underutilizes human capabilities, or if it rewards people
unjustly, these would be issues to take up in evaluating it. To
make a judgment we must have some values, some norms for what is
good and what is bad in economic life. </p>

<p>And the issue isn't so much some specific economic event,
perhaps a mistake, say, or the act of a psychopath, but the
built-in dynamics of the economy and their inevitable
implications for people's lives. So what would we like an economy
to achieve in the way of broad general aims?</p>

<p>There are many possible answers.</p>

<p>We might want an economy to simply maximize output for our
society. The economy that can yield the biggest pile of produced
stuff is the one we want, regardless of other effects. We might
want an economy which ensures that some set of people get the
most possible stuff, regardless of the overall amount produced or
what anyone else gets. We might want an economy which yields
identical outcomes for everyone in the society, regardless of
output, or with the largest output consistent with that degree of
equality. And so on.</p>

<p>I am going to propose some broad goals: equity, solidarity,
diversity, participatory self management, plus efficiency, and,
by implication, classlessness.</p>

<p>We could argue about these, I suppose, forever. And maybe we
should have some of that in our interactions. My reasons for
choosing these as the economic aims I want to see embodied in an
economy probably stem from all manner of things--you cannot
arrive at values purely by reason. But, I think among leftists
they should be pretty uncontroversial, save insofar as we might
wonder if a system can address them all simultaneously.</p>

<p>Thus, equity says we should have fair or just outcomes. No one
should get more of a good thing, or of a bad thing, than he or
she deserves. We will talk more about what determines how much
one deserves later&lt;193&gt;</p>

<p>Solidarity means the economy should foster empathy among
people, mutual respect and caring, rather than an attitude that
you are my enemy or, in any event, I don't care about your well
being.</p>

<p>Diversity merely testifies to a belief that homogeneity is
boring and we all benefit from diverse outcomes. Partly this is
because it is a good hedge against errors. Partly it is because
life is short and we can enjoy other people's different
involvements vicariously, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, participatory self management means that each person
should have a fair share of say over his or her own life. We
should be able to affect the decisions that in turn affect us,
and we should be able to do it in proportion as we are in turn
affected.</p>

<p>The claim is simple, in an economy, other things equal, if we
have more of these attributes, it is better. If we have less it
is worse.</p>

<p>At the same time, the economic function should be carried out
without waste (efficiency).</p>

<p>Classlessness is derivative because if you have classes, as
compared to not having them, you are worse on all these values.
class division reduces equity, curtails solidarity, reduces
diversity, and limits self management.</p>

<p>So, we can take our goals as the four noted, or as
classlessness, plus within the bounds of meeting those values,
economic efficiency.</p>

<p>For discussion purposes, if anyone wishes to argue that some
desirable value we would like to see implemented is left out if
we take these as our guides, please do. Or, for that matter, if
anyone wants to question any of this, likewise, please do. </p>

<p>My own personal justification for them is that they seem to me
to be consistent with and necessary for a maximum of personal
fulfillment and development for each individual and for the whole
population as a collective, consistent with the just norm that
everyone should have as good a shot at fulfillment and
development as anyone else.</p>

<p>These are going to be the values that guide my choices during
the class, but if anyone wants us to take into account others as
well, or instead, please suggest them.</p>

Course Outline--Consumerism in the U.S. Course</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Faculty: Juliet Schor</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>Greetings to all participants in the course on Consumerism in the United
States today. Welcome. I thought I would begin with a brief description of what
this course will be about, and then I have a few logistical details.</P>
<P>Some personal history: In 1992 I published a book called The Overworked
American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure (New York: Basic Books). The premise
of that book was that working hours have been rising in the United States since
the late 1960s, and that many Americans are now &quot;overworked&quot; and
stressed out. Instead of the leisure society which was predicted as a result of
automation and mechanization, we have become ever more enslaved to our jobs. The
attendant social consequences are predictable: families without enough time to
be together, children whose parents aren't around enough, growing unemployment
as work hours are concentrated among fewer and fewer employees, a decline of
sleep, a rise in stress, less time for volunteering and civic participation,
excessive business in daily life, erosion of community, etc. </P>
<P>In order to understand how this has happened, I developed the idea of the &quot;work
and spend&quot; cycle, and argued that our nation had become enmeshed in this
dynamic. In this course, we will begin with that idea, focussing mainly on the
spending side of it (after an initial section on work and worktimes). Why are we
such a &quot;spendaholic&quot; nation? What dynamics are at work? What is the
role of advertising in our consumerism? Television and mass media? What is the
impact of social pressure,i.e., keeping up with the Joneses&quot;?
Status-seeking? Are Americans obsessed with novelty? Where is our consumerism &quot;coming
from&quot;?</P>
<P>We will also look at the consequences of consumerist society--
environmental, cultural, economic, human. We will discuss alternatives to
consumerism, such as simple living, and the voluntary simplicity movement
sspringing up around the country. We will consider the economic and political
obstacles to a less consumerist society. Is it even possible in capitalism? 
</P>
<P>I am currently at work on a new book on consumerism (still in the research
phase). I will share my new research with you and will be interested to get your
feedback and reactions. </P>
<P>The format and procedures of the course will be this: Every weekend I will
write a lecture, which will be posted by Sunday evening at 9 pm EST. The first
lecture will come this Sunday. I will also post readings which relate to the
lecture, including two categories of readings: those which are strongly
recommended and very close to the topic, and those which are slightly less
close, but allow you to pursue the issues further or deeper. These correspond to
the usual classroom distinction between &quot;required&quot; and &quot;recommended&quot;
readings. Of course, in this session, no reading is required. You can just read
my lectures and follow the class discussion. However, you will get more out of
the course if you also do reading. Throughout the week, you will be able to
raise questions, make comments, etc. And I will respond to your
comments/messages when I post the next week's lecture. All substantive issues
should be referred to me. All technical questions about communicating online
should go to the ZBBS system operator.</P>
<P>Between now and Sunday, when I return, it would be nice if those of you who
are planning to take the course could &quot;introduce&quot; yourselves, with a
short discussion of who you are and your interest in the topic of consumerism.
</P>
<P>I look forward to &quot;meeting&quot; all of you. Juliet Schor </P>

Consumerism: Lecture 3</H1>
<H2>More on &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses.&quot;</H2>
<ADDRESS>Faculty: Juliet Schor</ADDRESS>
<HR>
<P>This week, I thought I would discuss the major work on &quot;keeping up with
the Joneses,&quot; or status competition to have come out in the last two
decades, namely Robert Frank's CHOOSING THE RIGHT POND (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1985). Frank is an interesting and eclectic economist from
Cornell University, who argues that the phenomenon of status-seeking is is
pervasive in our society, that economists have largely ignored it, and that the
attempts to gain status can explain much of the way labor markets, consumer
markets, and other aspects of the economy operate. I don't endorse his
criticisms of the left particularly, but I think this book has a lot to say. The
title Choosing the Right Pond refers to the fact that people can choose to be
little fish in big ponds or big fish in little ponds, and that their attitdues
about status will inform those choices. What follows is a summary of Frank's
arguments:</P>
<P>1. The importance of relative position and relative income. Duesenberry (and
others we talked about last week) argue that what matters to people is not just
their absolute level of income, but their relative income. This conclusion is
supported by some classic evidence, cited in most discussions on relative
income. First, Frank notes that surveys of happiness show that rising absolute
levels of income are not associated with rising absolute incomes. (I also
discuss this evidence in chapter 5 of my book, The Overworked American.) For
example, in the United States, there is no rise in happiness over the period
1946-1970, a period when average incomes rose dramatically. (For those sceptical
of opinion measures, self-reported happiness scores are correlated with &quot;objective&quot;
measures of people's well-being.) Second, Frank refers to the classic evidence
of Richard Easterlin, who found that happiness does rise with income, at any
given time. That is, within any country, at a given time, higher income people
are happier, and lower income people less happy. This will hold true as their
average income rises as well. And he found that across countries, the
relationship does not hold. People in poor countries are as happy (on average)
as those in rich countries. (This evidence has changed in recent years, perhaps
because a more globalized world has made those in poor countries more aware of
where they stand relative to rich country dwellers. Television, movies,
international travel and migration may have been responsible for this change.)
Another piece of evidence is that the amount of money Americans report is
necessary to live decently rises almost in parallel fashion with average
incomes. Our expectations and &quot;needs&quot; are not determined so much by
absolute levels, as by social norms. These norms are the basis of social
comparisons. </P>
<P>2. Is status seeking a biological imperative? Frank starts with a BIOLOGICAL
model, in which he argues that evidence from animal studies, as well as some
human studies, indicate that the quest for status is an innate characteristic of
human beings. He cites studies in which humans' heart rate and pulse are
measured in social situations. These find that people tend to have a higher
heart rate and faster pulse when they are in social situations with people of a
higher social status. He also looks at monkey studies show dominant monkeys have
higher levels of serotonin. (So do officers of college fraternities and leaders
of athletic teams!) Third, he argues that humans display a herd instinct, in
which we follow each other in status contests. He also provides anecdotal
evidence about children's behavior, arguing that by the time we reach adulthood
we have been taught to repress many of our natural desires for status (we are
taught that those feelings are shameful and anti-social.) In the children's
example, he performs an experiemnt on his children, giving them different levels
of organe juice each day. He finds that they don't mind getting less juice when
both of them receive less. It's when there's a disparity in what he pours out to
them that the trouble starts. </P>
<P>Is status-seeking biological? My answer at this point is that we don't
really know. I am generally sceptical of biological explanations for social
phenomenon. I don't think we know much about &quot;human nature&quot; at all.
Among both animals and humans the range of social interaction is so wide that
it's hard to draw a link to biology. The animal studies Frank cites are hardly
compelling, because it's almost always possible to find animal studies showing
opposite kinds of behavior. Where I do agree with Frank is that the drive for
social status seems to be very pervasive in our own society. And I think that's
what really matters at this point.</P>
<P>3. Who are we in competition with? For most of us, it's not Donald Trump,
the Rockefellers, or the folks on Dynasty. It's people in our own circles. Our
neighbors, co-workers, relatives, friends, etc. Most people choose their frames
of comparison realistically, focussing on people near us in the hierarchy. We
know the Rockefellers are out of reach. The buying patterns of the people next
door will have more of an impact on us. Objects of comparison (or what are
called reference groups) are also multiple. That is, we won't just compare
ourselves to ONE set of people. If we interact with a number of types of people,
we will have overlapping and varied reference groups. For example, employees
tend to have strong reference group identification with co-workers, but also
with neighbors. (I will provide some survey evidence on this in a later
lecture.) The media MAY also be important here. One argument is that popular
culture/media/advertising, by exposing us all to a common lifestyle, can create
a national reference group that large numbers of people relate to. And if
Hollywood and television show lifestyles are above the level most people can
afford (as they are), exposure to media can generate dissatisfaction, desires to
emulate, and aspirations which are beyond people's capability to achieve. (If
this sounds like it is counter to what I argued last week, I don't think it is.
My argument is not that the media is irrelevant, but that it operates within, or
on top of, this underlying context of social emulation/status competition.)</P>
<P>4. What do we compete about: the crucial role of visibility in social
competitions. As we begin to think about the dynamics of status competition, it
becomes clear that not all goods or activities can serve equally well in status
competitions. In particular, those things we are competing over need to be
somewhat &quot;socially visible.&quot; Why? If they are not, who's to know we
have them, and how can the desire to emulate be transmitted? To a certain
extent, there is a credibility problem here. If I am trying to gain social
status, I can brag about having particular things (like a fat bank account, or a
safe deposit box full of valuables), but I may not be telling the truth. Why
will others believe me? If the goods we compete about are visible, there's no
need to advertise what we have. It is evident and obvious. Visibility also deals
with another problem associated with status. If you try too hard to get it, you
can't. Striving for status can backfire, as the nouveau riche often painfully
find out. Sorting out the credibility and legitimacy of status claims is a key
part of the game. For example, in eighteenth century England, when an emerging
bourgeoisie was attempting to rise socially, the aristocrats and landed gentry
developed a social system based on &quot;patina&quot; to de-legitimize the
claims of these nouveau riche. What was patina? It was the inevitable signs of
age that goods achieve as they are passed from generation to generation.
Anthropologist Grant McCracken in his book, CULTURE AND CONSUMPTION
(Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990, ch 2 on patina) argues that the
patina system was the dominant system of social organization until sometime in
the eighteenth century. At the height of the patina system, pretenders would try
and counterfeit status by acquiring used goods, or by trying to make new ones
look good. (Hence the use of family crests, etc., which make it impossible to
use another family's possession to acquire status for yourself.) It is easy to
see how, in a society of fashion and mass consumption, the patina system cannot
survive. Status began to be associated with novelty. Today, and since the 18th
century, only the rich still practice a status system based on patina. </P>
<P>But to return to social visibility. Patina was one system based on socially
visible goods and their characteristics. We may have abandoned patina, but
socially visible goods are still the lynchpin of social competitions. What are
they? Cars, houses, furniture and clothes are the most obvious examples of
modern status symbols. If we think carefully about patterns of buying, we can
see how visibility plays a role. Take furniture. Where is the fanciest furniture
in the house? The most public (and ironically least used room), the living room.
Which will be the least well-decorated? The bedrooms (most private). (Where will
people hang curtains last, or not at all? Bedrooms.) What about clothes? The
prestige of the &quot;brand&quot; people wear rises as we move from
undergarments to coats and overcoats? It is my contention that in a whole range
of products, the evidence will show that the prices paid, and the status of
brand names bought will rise with the level of &quot;social visibility&quot; of
the product. </P>
<P>In a recent paper I have written with a former student, Angela Chao,
entitled &quot;Empirical Tests of Status Consumption: Evidence from Women's
Cosmetics&quot; we test just this idea. We have gathered both quality and price
data on four cosmetics products: lipsticks, mascara, eyeshadow, and facial
cleansers. These four have significantly different levels of social visibility.
Lipsticks are taken out in public (at dinner tables, in meetings, etc.)
Eyeshadows and mascaras are semi-public, seen more in women's &quot;powder rooms&quot;
but sometimes in full view. And facial cleansers are only used in the privacy of
women's own homes. We hypothesize two things. First, that the relationship
between price and quality will be weaker the more socially visible the product.
And second, that we will find more &quot;high-end&quot; or high- priced buying
among the visible products. Both these hypotheses turned out to be strongly
supported by our evidence. With lipsticks, the most visible good, there is NO
relationship between price and quality. In fact, all lipsticks (within type,
ie., matte, shiny, etc.) are made of identical ingredients and in blind &quot;taste-tests&quot;
consumers cannot tell the difference between cheap and expensive lipsticks. In
fact, in one extreme example, consumers could not differentiate between Flame
Glow (a low- status brand selling at $18.83 an ounce) and Chanel (perhaps the
most prestige name of all, selling at $181,24 an ounce). When the lipsicks were
in generic containers, just as many women preferred Flame Glow as chose Chanel.
Why then are women paying $25 for a Chanel lipstick when they can get an
identical product for $2? Our answer: the social status associated with Chanel,
and the social embarassment of pulling out the $2 brand. By contrast, women do
demand somewhat more quality in their choice of facial cleansers, where it turns
out that more expensive brands are ranked more highly in terms of quality.</P>
<P>We also found strong differences in how women buy, based on social
visibility. There is much more &quot;high end&quot; buying in lipsticks than
facial cleansers, and an intermediate amount in the eyeshadows and mascaras,
exactly as we predicted. We also found differences in the extent to which
different types of women seek status. Women with more education and more income
do more status buying. Women in cities and suburbs, and white women are also
more status-conscious. These are exactly the patterns we expected.</P>
<P>We think that if we replicated this kind of study for other products
(clothes, houses, cars, furniture, etc.) we would find similar patterns. Up to
this point, however, we have not been able to find the kinds of data we need to
do so.</P>
<P>5. Status goods as &quot;signals&quot; and the need to keep up. This point
relates to the interesting comments made by Holly Pence in response to last
week's lecture. As she argued, there are strong pressures for individuals to &quot;keep
up&quot; in the status game. If you are looking for a job, or trying to succeed
in one, bucking the standard marks of status can be interpreted as a &quot;signal&quot;
that you are failing. (i.e., clothes below the standard, a beat-up car in a
management environment, etc.) In interviews I have done with women who have &quot;downshifted&quot;
(ie., are dropping down or out of the rat race), the expenses of maintaining a
professional wardrobe continually comes up. These women may not necessarily
enjoy shopping or spending their money on clothes, but they feel it is necessary
to appear to be successful and competent. Similarly, for people whose jobs
involve impressing clients, the appearance of success is important (a nice
office, a good car, expensive clothes). If you look too shabby, your ability
will be questioned. Why? Because spending is a signal of income which is taken
to be indicative of ability. As long as the society operates with a status
system (as all do, in one way or another), the pressures on individuals to
conform are strong. And our particular system is one which focusses on SOCIALLY
VISIBLE CONSUMER GOODS.</P>
<P>6. Prisoners' dilemmas and inadequate incentives for non-visible goods. Once
the competition is oriented to socially visible goods, it becomes obvious that
socially invisible goods will be underproduced and underdemanded. Important
examples are public goods, occupational health and safety, savings, and leisure,
none of which focus as status symbols, and all of which are in inadequate supply
in our economy today. Why? Think of a two person competition, between Smith and
Jones. Let's say they're competing about visible consumer goods and what matters
is their relative positions. In a 12 hour day, they could each work 8 hours a
day with 4 hours leisure, or 12 hours a day with no leisure. If they both work
12, they will both have the same income, (and hence be equally socially), but no
leisure. This is the worst outcome for both. Smith could work 8 hours a day, but
if Jones works 12, he or she will be behind socially (because Smith's income
will be lower). The converse is also true. The best outcome for both would be an
8 hour day, with 4 hours of leisure and an equal position for each. The
prisoner's dilemma (a solution to a standard game theory problem) is that by
cooperating they could get to the best outcome (the 8 hour day). But because we
have a non-cooperative, decentralized, market system, they cannot cooperate.
They will both be forced to work as hard as they can in order to compete. The
outcome will be the 12 hour day for both. They're both worse off, but without
cooperation neither trusts that the other will stay at 8. (and neither will).
[The name prisoner's dilemma comes from the famous example of two prisoners who
both confess, (the uncooperative solution), and both go to jail, rather than
both keep silent (the cooperative solution) and go free. Each fears the other is
confessing, and so is driven to confess him or herself. This is what happens in
our example. Both Jones and Smith fear the other will work longer hours, and
thereby get ahead in the competition.]</P>
<P>This example shows one reason why we don't have enough leisure in our
society, why people don't save enough, or why the pressure to reduce taxes for
public consumption goods is so strong. We are so heavily oriented toward STATUS
COMPETITION IN PRIVATE, VISIBLE GOODS. There are lots of reasons to think this
competition got worse in the 1980s. And that various social restraints on such
competition are weakening. And once again, this is an example of how advertising
and the media can have an effect--through their exacerbation of this
competition. </P>
<P>7. Final point: The need for a centralized, cooperative intervention. The
prisoner's dilemma problem (the failure to achieve a better, cooperative
solution) shows why we need government intervention in the market to steer us
from too much destructive status competition. As Robert Frank argues, this is
the rationale behind having uniforms in high schools (to reduce clothes
competition). Or one rationale for a consumption tax, or incentives for saving.
(A savings account is a socially invisible thing. People can brag about how much
they've got, but it's not all that credible.) We are in a situation now much
like the ball game where one by one people start standing up to get a better
view. The first few people benefit. But eventually, everyone sees only as well
as they did when sitting, and their legs are all tired. They need an announcer
to get on the loudspeaker and tell them all to sit back down. </P>
<P>It looks to me like we have gotten onto a faster and faster consumer
treadmill, working longer hours and depriving ourselves of savings, public
goods, and a healthy environment, in order to keep this competition going. It's
high time somebody told us all to sit down and relax. The question is, how do we
get people to listen?</P>
<P>NOTE: I enjoyed your comments last week. Next week I will present some
evidence from the survey I have just conducted on these issues. Have a nice
holiday tomorrow. By the way, on our last one day holiday--Veterans Day--I
noticed the whole world was shopping. In fact, near a new designer clothing
outlet here, the police had to close down the off ramp from the Interstate,
because the traffic to get to the mall was blocking up the whole highway. How's
that for American consumerism!

Political Economy: Lecture 3</H1>
<H2>Different Economic Visions</H2>
<ADDRESS>Faculty: Robin Hahnel</ADDRESS>
<HR>
<P>The simplest way to organize economic activities is for every person to
produce everything she wants to consume and consume everything she produces.
That is, for every person to be totally self-sufficient. This is the &quot;autarkic&quot;
solution to the economic problem and has never been used because (1) human
beings are a social species and have never been inclined to &quot;go it alone&quot;
except under extreme and temporary conditions of geographical isolation, and (2)
this solution is very inefficient compared to solutions where people specialize
in some production task(s) and &quot;trade&quot; with others who specialize in
other tasks, since greater &quot;division of labor&quot; can permit greater
overall productivity.</P>
<P>Every other solution to the economic problem involves organizing and
coordinating the interdependent activities of people. This is always done via
major economic institutions that combine into some particular kind of &quot;economic
system&quot; that governs production, consumption, and allocation.</P>
<P>Every economic system must decide:</P>
<P>(1) What to produce (and what not to produce.)</P>
<P>(2) How much of each kind of good or service   to produce.</P>
<P>(3) How to produced each good or service,   since there is usually more than
one way to   produce things.</P>
<P>(4) Who will consume what goods and services.</P>
<P>(5) How to distribute the burdens and benefits   of this &quot;social&quot;
economic activity among the   members of the economy.</P>
<P>What distinguishes one kind of economic system from another is how each of
these decisions gets made. What combination of institutional promotion and
conscious human decision making are brought to bear on these decisions? Which
people, or groups of people make which decisions under what kinds of
institutional constraints? Different economic systems answer these questions
differently. And as I argued in the second part of the first week's lecture,
what makes one economic system better or worse than another is whether one makes
these decisions more equitably and efficiently, with a greater degree of
self-management, promoting a greater degree of solidarity and variety, than
another. But what are the major possible economic systems? Feudalism is a system
where peasants manage themselves farming parcels of land to which they have &quot;use
right&quot; by inheritance. But in exchange for their use right they must give
part of their harvest to the Lord of the manor. They might also have to work for
free on lands belonging to the Lord of the manor under their own, or his
supervision. The Lord receives his part of the peasants' produce, and keeps what
the peasants produce on his land supposedly in exchange for protecting the
peasants from conquest by another Lord. But this is very much like store owners
paying protection money to the local mafia who protect them from... you guessed
it, retaliation at the hands of the local mafia should the store owners refuse
or forget to pay protection money. With hindsight, few find the system very
complex. His monopoly of military power permits the Lord to exact tribute in the
form of goods and labor services from those who reside within his fiefdom.
Military power allows the Lord to take part of what the peasants produce, and
consume a great deal more than they without working himself at all.</P>
<P>While it is tempting to agree with Marx that the basis and nature of feudal
exploitation is transparent -- as compared to the nature and basis of capitalist
exploitation -- presumably it did not appear so to many of feudalism's denizens.
One suspects that few Lords saw peasants as other than lazy, cowardly, low life
that didn't deserve the protection he afforded them. And many mixtures of
tradition and religion in different parts of the world have combined to weave
complicated ideological webs of rationalization and acceptance on the part of
peasants who failed to see the distribution of burdens and benefits of feudalism
as anything other than natural, fair, and beyond question.</P>
<P>Markets for goods are not integral to feudalism. [Granted, in real world
feudalism goods were traded between different regions by merchants and artisans
selling to Lords and well-to-do peasants. But this activity was peripheral to
the feudal system -- and eventually proved to be a cancer that contributed to
the demise of feudalism and birth of capitalism.] Nor is there a market for
labor in feudalism. Peasants are not free to sell their services for a wage. The
are precisely unfree to work for anyone, anywhere, because they must work on the
land to which they have inherited user rights and their Lord's lands. Peasants
work under their own direction both on their family plots and usually on the
lands of the Lord as well, so they are not &quot;alienated.&quot; The Lord does
not &quot;oppress&quot; his peasants in the sense that he controls and directs
how they work, but only in the sense that they are his inherited captives who
must render goods and services unto him according to traditions and regulations
that the Lord interprets. And while borrowing and lending occurred in real world
feudalism, a credit market is not integral to feudalism either. Lords would go
into debt to wealthy merchants who operated outside the feudal system to finance
consumption and military binges. But peasants did not borrow to be able to
produce, and pay back principal and interest out of the production thereby made
possible.</P>
<P>In sum, there is exploitation in feudalism, but neither alienation nor
oppression as we defined them in the previous lecture. There are two classes
since peasants work and Lords do not, though Lords consume far better than
peasants. To all of us who can recognize the existence of &quot;feudal
exploitation,&quot; the burdens and benefits of economic cooperation are
distributed unfairly in feudalism with the Lords receiving the lion's share of
the benefits and the peasants shouldering most of the burdens. Nor would one
expect feudalism to be particularly efficient. There is little division of labor
to provide greater productivity. And there is limited incentive for either Lord
or peasant to improve productive techniques since either would have to share a
major part of the gains from any improvement with the other.</P>
<P>Capitalism is an economic system guided by two major economic institutions:
(1) Private ownership of productive assets wherein those who own those assets
hire others to work for them under their direction for an agreed wage [otherwise
known as &quot;private enterprise.&quot; And (2) markets where anyone can buy
and sell any kind of good or service on terms that are mutually acceptable to
buyer and seller [otherwise know as &quot;free markets&quot; or a &quot;market
economy.&quot; So a short hand way of describing a capitalist economy is as a
Private Enterprise Market Economy, or PrEME.</P>
<P>In capitalism there are employers who hire employees to work under their
direction with tools and machinery and land the employers own or have rented.
And there are employees who agree to work under an employer's direction in
return for a wage. Nobody consumes what they produce herself, but instead buy
what they want to consume in goods markets paying with whatever &quot;income&quot;
they may have. Employees, or workers get income from wages. Employers, or
capitalists get income from profits -- the difference between the revenues they
get from selling the goods their employees make and the costs they incur hiring
employees and whatever equipment and materials the employees need to work with.
</P>
<P>Since workers work and capitalists don't, though capitalists consume far
better than workers, there is exploitation in capitalism. But just as few feudal
Lords recognized feudal exploitation, we should not be surprised if few
capitalists recognize capitalist exploitation. Instead most capitalists see
workers as lazy and unable to engage in productive activity if not for the
equipment [capital] and organizational efforts [entrepreneurship] extended by
capitalists. And most capitalists see workers' wages as more than they deserve,
and their own profits as meager compensation for the critical role they play.
More surprisingly many workers fail to see &quot;capitalist exploitation&quot;
and accept the view that since their labor contract is voluntary and mutually
beneficial there is no exploitation. It is also not only capitalists who see
profits as legitimate compensation for an important service -- making available
the equipment and inputs necessary for production and organizing complex
production processes. But for all of us who can recognize &quot;capitalist
exploitation,&quot; the burdens and benefits of economic cooperation are
distributed unfairly in capitalism with capitalists receiving the lion's share
of the benefits and workers shouldering most of the burdens. The basis for
capitalist exploitation is not a monopoly of military power but a monopoly of
the means necessary for production that make it possible for capitalists to pay
workers less than required to purchase all the workers produced, thereby leaving
capitalists with profit income with which to purchase part of what their
employees made without having to work themselves. There is also alienation and
oppression as we have defined them in capitalism since capitalists get to decide
how workers laboring capacities will be utilized.</P>
<P>Strictly speaking, these are the only two classes capitalism &quot;must&quot;
have. But &quot;pure capitalism&quot; seldom exists in reality. Since real
economies evolve in particular historical patterns, there are usually remnants
of previous economic systems within emergent systems, and at some point aspects
of future economic systems begin to develop within present systems. One form
these remnants and precursors take is classes that played important roles in
previous systems or could play important roles in future systems. So during
different eras classes other than capitalists and workers have played important
roles in real world capitalist economies. It is also terribly important to
remember that the organization of the economic sphere of social life is not the
only important defining feature of human societies. How the political, kinship,
and community spheres are organized, how the dynamics in other spheres of social
life affect and are affected by the dynamics in the economic sphere combine with
economic dynamics to determine how a society operates. And besides classes
defined by the dynamics of capitalism (in conjunction with classes from previous
and future economic formations,) groups defined by the social relations in other
spheres -- especially community, gender, and politically defined groups that are
privileged or oppressed by the organization of non-economic activities and
therefore have conflicting interests in social change or stability -- interact
along with whatever classes emerge from the functioning of the economy. These
are important lessons that derive from a complementary holist, as opposed to an
&quot;economistic&quot; perspective. </P>
<P>But even when looking at real world capitalist economies, classes other than
capitalists and workers have played important roles. In early European
capitalism landlords were an important third class, and along with capitalists
and workers were the object of scrutiny by economists like Adam Smith and David
Ricardo in particular. Landlords, or course, were the previously dominant class
in European feudalism and remained a potent force in the European economies as
capitalism developed there. Landlords also play important roles in many third
world economies today. This is not the time or place to discuss how the
introduction of capitalism into third world societies by foreign companies and
governments leads to class and community struggles that are a great deal more
complicated than the class dynamics of some pure, abstract capitalist model.
Suffice it to say that the 500 year evolution of modern day imperialism has left
most third world economies with a much more complex combination of classes and
community groups that struggle over social stability and change in those
societies.</P>
<P>In his own analysis of 19th century European capitalism, Marx focused no
little attention on a class he called the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; of
self-employed sellers of goods and services whose origins were in precapitalist
market dynamics, and who Marx expected to &quot;wither away&quot; with
capitalist development. But elements from this class transformed into part of a
class that has come to play an increasingly important role in modern, corporate
capitalism. Where owners of large corporations are stockholders divorced from
managing the production process, and where mediation of the conflicts between
capitalist and workers both inside and outside the work place has taken on
greater importance, what Mike Albert and I call the coordinator class, and
Barbara and John Ehrenreich call the professional managerial class, play an
important role in the space &quot;between labor and capital.&quot; [Hence the
title of Pat Walker's edited book of essays that discuss how to understand and
evaluate the behavior of this class in modern capitalism.] Moreover, I will
argue that it is impossible to understand what occurred in the &quot;post-capitalist&quot;
economies of the 20th century, or evaluate different post-capitalist visions,
without understanding the coordinator class and its potential to become the
ruling class in particular kinds of post-capitalist economies. But what &quot;post-capitalist&quot;
alternatives exist?</P>
<P>Public Enterprise, Centrally Planned Economies or PuECPEs: In this economic
system control over human-made and natural productive assets is in &quot;public&quot;
rather than &quot;private&quot; hands and the allocation of resources and goods
is determined by a plan. There is no private ownership of land, resources, and
factories giving decision making authority over their use to individuals;
instead authority over the use of &quot;society's productive resources&quot; is
determined by the procedures of &quot;central planning.&quot;</P>
<P>In central planning the relative social values of different final goods and
services is determined by a political process (that may be dictatorial or
democratic) which are then communicated to a Central Planning Board. The CPB is
directed to maximize the value of economic activity in light of the resource
availabilities and productive capabilities of the economy. The CPB collects
information on: the availability of land, resources, and labor with different
skills and training, the technical capabilities of different production
facilities' abilities to combine inputs to produce outputs, and proceeds to
calculates a &quot;plan&quot; that maximizes the social value of production
given resource and technological constraints. How this all can be done, what
different options are available, and the political, social, human, and economic
consequences of how it is done, we will explore theoretically and historically
when we look at the collapse of communism in week seven. For now, suffice it to
say that economies CAN be run according to a central plan that determines what
to produce, how much to produce, how to produce it, and how to distribute it. In
one sense, the planning system consists of communicating society's economic
priorities to planners who determine how best to achieve those goals with
society's limited productive resources. In another sense the planning system
consists of a small group of planners in the CPB and managers in the publicly
owned enterprises deciding what and how to produce things, telling workers where
and how to work, and telling consumers what they will have to consume. While
central planning is essentially a non-market system for making economic
decisions, we will see that markets CAN appear within central planning to
accomplish particular tasks. The important thing when this occurs is to remember
that while markets may be used to distribute goods to consumers once they are
produced, markets do not determine how much of different goods will be produced
in centrally planned economies. Similarly, while labor markets may be used to
assign particular workers to particular enterprises, labor markets do not
determine how many workers of each kind will work in different plants, and do
not determine wage rates. How much to of what to produce and how many workers of
different skills will work where for how much is all determined by the plan even
when markets exist in central planning.</P>
<P>Many supporters of public enterprise, centrally planned economies saw it as
a classless economy. Everyone would be worker/consumers on an equal footing. The
nightmare of private appropriation of scarce social resources along with the
inequity, alienation, and inefficiency this brought would be replaced by a
rational use of productive resources to best achieve society's economic goals.
In this view central planners and managers were merely to be knowledgeable
servants of the workers and consumers, translating their desires about
consumption and work preferences into the most efficient assignment of
productive capabilities. In reality this is not what occurred in the Soviet
Union, Eastern Europe, China, Cuba -- or any place the system has been deployed.
Instead classes emerged in all centrally planned economies -- even the least
corrupt. And I will argue this is predictable, and not merely the result of
non-democratic political influences or betrayals on the part of foolish or
corrupt leaders. Instead of a capitalist ruling class, centrally planned
economies are ruled by a coordinator class of planners and managers who end up
oppressing and exploiting workers and consumers. The idea that the coordinators
are working for the workers and consumers is a doublespeak myth. Instead it is
workers who labor at the behest of the coordinator class who consume more than
ordinary workers, work under more pleasant conditions than ordinary workers, and
make all important economic decisions. Ordinary workers are alienated from
decision making and have inferior work lives and consumption opportunities. This
is not to say that all workers are equally exploited or alienated in centrally
planned systems. And it is important to recognize there are other oppressor and
oppressed groups that emerge from the kind of political, community, and kinship
systems that have accompanied experiments in central planning. But even in at
its best, public enterprise centrally planned economies would be plagued by
classes, exploitation, oppression and alienation. They cannot be classless
utopias.</P>
<P>Public Enterprise Market Economies or PuEMEs: PuEMEs combine public
ownership with allocation of goods and services through markets. We will
consider different variations on this theme in the eighth and ninth week of the
course when we focus on current debates over desirable alternatives to
capitalism. But the most important difference between different &quot;models&quot;
of PuEMEs is how the managers of the public enterprises are selected. In the
early 1950s the Communist Party of Yugoslavia broke with tradition and replaced
its system of central planning with a system they called &quot;workers'
self-managed market socialism.&quot; They not only dismantled their planning
bureaucracy telling public enterprises to buy whatever inputs they needed in the
market place and sell their output in markets; they gave employees considerable
influence over hiring their own enterprise managers. A number of political
economists have elaborated theoretical models based on this idea that I call
Public Enterprise, Employee Managed, Market Economies, PuEEMMEs. The other major
category of PuEME is one where a state agency appoints managers of the publicly
owned enterprises and monitors their performance. A system along these lines was
used in the Soviet Union during the 1920s during what was known as the New
Economic Policy, or NEP. Oscar Lange, Abba Lerner, and Frederick Taylor analyzed
a theoretical version of the model in the 1930s. The model became the &quot;reform
model&quot; critics of the PuECPE model proposed in the Post World War II era in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. And to the extent that &quot;Perestroika&quot;
-- literally economic restructuring -- had specific content in the Gorbachev
era, the idea was to transform to a Public Enterprise, State Managed, Market
Economy, PuESMME.</P>
<P>We will discover there are important differences between PuESMMEs and
PuEEMMEs. But I will argue that while the former is much worse than the latter,
both variants of Public Enterprise Market Economies are inevitably plagued by
exploitation, class divisions, and alienation. In these economies the capitalist
class will also be replaced by a coordinator class who will dominate economic
decision making and exploit ordinary worker/consumers. The systems will be
driven by market enforced competition that promotes self-serving, anti- social
behavior rather than bureaucratic intimidation and patronage that is the motor
force of centrally planned economies, and the dynamics and tendencies of market
based coordinator economies will differ substantially from centrally planned
coordinator economies. But exploitation will certainly exist since public
enterprise market economies necessarily reward participants according to Maxim
2: to each according to the value of his or her personal contribution, which
means those with greater human capital will work in more desirable settings and
enjoy better consumption opportunities than those with less human capital. And a
class of managers, technocrats, bankers, and mutual fund managers -- depending
on the model in question -- will exert an influence over economic decisions
greatly in excess of the degree to which they are affected by the decisions
leaving most workers and consumers alienated from the most important decisions
affecting their economic lives.</P>
<P>Public Enterprise Economies with Participatory Planning, or PuEPPEs: Pat
Devine of the University of Manchester in England has provided a detailed
description of a system of democratic planning he calls negotiated coordination.
Mike Albert and I have presented a model we call participatory economics, or &quot;parecon&quot;
for those familiar with LBBS forums. In both systems enterprises are publicly
owned and market allocation is replaced by a system of democratic, or
participatory planning. As in the case of different versions of PuEMEs there are
important differences between these models, but both claim to remain true to the
goals of those who have insisted that a positive alternative to market driven
systems is both possible and highly desirable.</P>
<P>In a participatory economy enterprises are publicly owned and managed by
workers councils where not only do all members have equal voting rights but job
&quot;complexes&quot; are balanced for both desirability and empowerment.
Consumption opportunities are based on effort, or personal sacrifice, and
consumption is organized by neighborhood consumers councils and federations. And
workers and consumers manage their interconnected activities through a
participatory planning procedure where each workers and consumers council
proposes and revises what its own activity will be in light of increasingly
accurate information about the consequences for others.</P>
<P>There have been no &quot;real world&quot; examples of stable participatory
economies we can study and evaluate. For brief periods revolutionary groups of
workers and activists have engaged in experiments that shed some light on what
we might expect. In the earliest years of the Russian Revolution, before the
Civil War and Bolshevik dictatorship crushed them, factory committees and
soviets attempted to coordinate their economic activities through negotiation
and planning based on solidarity rather than through markets or central
planning. In parts of Northern Italy in the early 1920s, in Anarchist regions of
Spain during the Spanish Civil War, and during the uprising in Hungary in 1956
economic activities were organized for brief periods of time on the many of the
same principals as those that define participatory economics. And there is much
in current Zapatista thinking and practice in Mexico that is consistent with the
ideas behind participatory economics. But historical experience is very limited
and incomplete. In any case, we will spend weeks eight and nine discussing the
debate that has revolved around participatory planning versus market based
alternatives to capitalism over the past four years. But if its advocates are
right, participatory economics goes farther to eliminate exploitation,
oppression, alienation, and class divisions than any of the other economic
systems we know of, and improves efficiency as well. Critics, on the other hand,
have argued that there would be significant efficiency losses as well as
unacceptable losses of personal liberties or freedoms in such economies, and
that a transition to such an economy from a modern capitalist system is
inconceivable. You of course, will read and participate in the debate, and make
up your own minds. </P>

<p>
<hr>Los estudiantes <a href="zmicon.htm">graduados</a> del Proyecto de
Telecomunicaciones del Z Media Institute 1995, hemos decidido ofrecer un
recurso para obtener y transmitir la informacin necesaria para crear una
conciencia social entre la ciudadana.</p>

<p> Z Media Institute es parte de <a href="zmag.htm">Z Magazine</a>, que
le ofrecer a usted una nueva perspectiva, diferente a la usted recibe
a travs de los medios de informacin controlados por las mega-corporaciones.
Si usted est interesado en ste proyecto y desea obtener mayor informacin,
usted puede comunicarse a travs del <a href="zmicon.htm">email</a> con
muchos de los estudiantes graduados del ZMI 1995, y algunos de nuestros
instructores.</p>

<p> El sistema de los medios de comunicacin en los Estados Unidos contina
negando la oportunidad de proveerle a los ciudadanos una informacin real
sobre la vida contempornea (y tambin del pasado). Estos medios solo reportan
un pequeo porcentaje de los sucesos y las decisiones que forman el mundo,
a la par que ofrecen un estrecho mrgen para la discusin, opinin, perspectivas
y soluciones a los problemas del mundo de hoy (y del futuro).</p>

<p> No es una sorpresa saber que solo 20 mega-corporaciones controlan los
principales medios de informacin de la nacin. En su libro <i>El Monopolio
de los Medios de Comunicacin</i>, Ben Bagdikian predijo esta cifra hace
12 aos y, para el siglo que se aprxima, l dice que solo 5 o 6 mega-corporaciones
controlaran nuestros medios de informacin. Estas mega-corporaciones invierten
en muchas otras empresas y solo estn interesados en los medios de comunicacin
como empresas para hacer dinero. En busca de ste objetivo, ellos le niegan
a los ciudadanos la informacin necesaria para hacer decisiones racionales
sobre los complejos problemas que enfrenta nuestra sociedad y, de esta
manera, crear una verdadera Democracia. S la General Electric (GE), la
cual construye reactores nucleares, es propietaria de una cadena de televisin,
usted no ver una discusin racional sobre los peligros de los deshechos
radiactivos en el aire, o como nios y adolescentes del Tercer Mundo son
explotados para construir piezas semi-manufacturas en las fbricas que
la GE tiene en stas naciones (una verdad espantosa que la oculta dicindonos
en sus comerciales de TV que la GE hace cosas buenas para la vida).</p>

<p> En este sentido, los grandes medios de comunicacin solo presentan
la perspectiva que favorece a los propsitos de las lites financieras
y corporativas, privando a la gente de ms puntos de vista sobre lo que
est ocurriendo y los cambios que son posibles para lograr una sociedad
ms humana. Para enfrentar ste problema, deben crearse mltiples fuentes
de informacin (uno de los objetivos fundamentales del Z Media Institute).
Estos incluyen peridicos comunitarios, revistas alternativas, casas editoras,
redes informativas a travs de computadoras (como <a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/">IGC</a>),
estaciones de radio, cadenas de televisin por cable, etc. Y desde que
estos medios no pueden ser controlados por las mega corporaciones, debido
a que no cuentan con un sustancial presupuesto proveniente de los anuncios
<a href="zmibooks.htm">publicitarios</a>, stos no son muy conocidos. </p>

<p><img src="spkout.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32>There is a change in the discourse on healthcare in Canada toward increasing discussion of 
privatization of parts of the public system. This has emerged recently and is taking place in the 
media but also within the leadership of professional organizations. The debate is fostered by the 
notion that the public system is no longer viable given the perceived need for decreased government 
spending to help curb the national debt, rhetoric that closely parallels what is being spouted south of 
the border. There is general acceptance of this thinking, which has framed the debate along 
right-wing lines, despite the strong evidence that single-payer healthcare administered by 
government has proven to be a much more cost-efficient system than what currently exists in the 
US.</p>
<p>The single-payer debate that was lost badly in the US a few years ago provided Canadians with a 
lot of cross-border propaganda that did nothing to improve the perception of the Canadian system 
within Canada. Managed care is emerging as the dominant system in the US and has so far proved 
to be extremely profitable . Expansion into the Canadian market would be the logical next step . 
The development of a two-tiered system such as exists in the UK will undermine services in the 
public system and bring an end to universality based on equal quality of services. It is my hope to 
increase the amount of discussion about this possibility and to bring a greater sense of urgency to it. 
I suspect that the groundwork is currently being laid to allow US managed care companies to enter 
the Canadian market and, if action isn't taken to open the debate now, that it will be too late to take 
any preventive action. I am interested in networking with other individuals to plan a strategy for 
public education around this issue.</p>

<hr>
<h3>The State of Israel and the People of Palestine </h3>
<p>&quot;Israel's actions aren't terrorism&quot; is the title of a commentary by Norman Miller that was printed in 
the Ashland (Oregon) Daily Tidings, May 21, 1996. The text follows:</p>
<p>&quot;The commentary by Robert Jones on the April 23 Opinion page is definitely Palestinian sour 
grapes. Israel's closing of the West Bank and Gaza borders following Arab terrorism has been 
going on since 1967. The Arab population in these two areas had hidden the terrorists from Israeli 
police, and continue to do so, forcing Israeli action.</p>
<p>&quot;You mistakenly refer to police attempts to arrest these murderers as terrorism. These are the same 
as the Montana and Oklahoma acts, and are vile attempts to frighten the legitimate government.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1948, the Israeli government offered the Arabs living within the U.N.-mandated boundaries the 
opportunity to become citizens, to live and work in Israel. Many did, and do not collaborate with 
Palestinian terrorism.</p>
<p>&quot;The other Arabs were offered sanctuary at that time by Egypt, Syria and Jordan, who encouraged 
them not to accept the Israeli offer. They were not given citizenship in these Arab countries, but 
were declared refugees for economic and political reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;You said the terrorist's families did not know about their acts. That's a lie. Arab families are not 
American. They back their family all the way, and terrorism attempts have been continuing for 30 
years from these same family groups.</p>
<p>&quot;The Arab refugees who migrated to Egypt and Jordan in 1948 were not permitted to work, and 
were placed by their brethren in refugee camps in Gaza and the West Bank, and were supported 
by U.N. grants.</p>
<p>&quot;When Israel signed the peace treaty with Egypt and returned the Sinai, Egypt refused to take back 
the Gaza strip, a piece of Sinai. Jordan has also refused to take back the West Bank. These 
Palestinians had been the major obstacle to peace treaties with these countries. Both Egypt and 
Jordan treaties specifically excluded the Palestinian refugees because they didn't want to support 
them.</p>
<p>&quot;Both Gaza and the West Bank do not have jobs for their people. Since 1967, Israel has been the 
only country to permit these people to work in their land-even though they are not citizens. In 
addition to giving them Israeli jobs, the Israeli government established schools in Gaza and the 
West Bank, giving them education for the first time, and built utilities and housing, which never 
existed before in these areas. The Israeli government did these things to improve Arab's quality of 
life.</p>
<p>&quot;For your information, the Hezbollah terrorists, supported by Islamic populations of Lebanon, Syria 
and Iran, have been bombing Israel for more than 20 years. They live and fire their bombs from 
outside their homes. This is war, supported or not, by the Lebanese government.</p>
<p>&quot;Arab propaganda frequently excludes facts. The above were missed by your comments. It is 
common knowledge that Israel never acts without sufficient cause, because they have always lived 
under the world's microscope.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TO RESPOND:</strong></p>
<p>Palestinian &quot;terrorists&quot; are Israeli-made, as the Jewish resistance in Warsaw was Nazi-made. 
People are not born terrorists. Terrorism could be violence in resistance to authority; usually it's 
violence for the purpose of subjugation. Blowing up the Oklahoma City Federal Building was &quot; the 
same&quot; as Palestinian's resistance to Israel's encroachment on their homeland, asserts Miller: an 
ideological flight from rationality. Miller refers to UN mandated boundaries of Israel, but who gave 
the UN authority to give away the land where the Palestinians lived? Actually, under the semblance 
of law the UN action was a disguise for U. S.-British seizure and disposal of foreign land. By way 
of the &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot; it sanctioned British betrayal of their Arab allies of the first World War, 
who had been promised Arab political suzerainty of Palestine, instead authorizing a Jewish-Zionist 
state in Arab territory. No more appropriate label for this piece of imperial treachery could be 
imagined; Arthur James, First Earl of Balfour, was nicknamed &quot;Bloody Balfour&quot; for his style of 
implementing Britannia's imperial fiats in the countries of various subjugated people of the empire 
that bestrode the seven seas.</p>
<p>The U. S. also approved of this gift of the expropriated heritage of the Palestinians to another 
people; its ruling class had built a nation by similar practices. For one thing it helped ease the 
problems of domestic anti-Semitism. (Considering what the Jews have endured, we should 
remember, ironically , that Palestinians are of Semitic origin , too.) It also facilitated accomplishment 
of the U. S. aim of giving military-political support to U. S.-based corporations lusting for a hold on 
the newly discovered oil wealth of the middle east.. What an equitable division! One interloper, the 
new state, got a choice portion of surface ground; the other, in the course of time, a lion's share of 
what lay underneath. Thus was more than half of Palestine handed over to the theocratic control of 
Zionism; at the time the Jewish population, despite the British-U.S. facilitated influx of Jewish 
refugees, was considerably less than 50% of the total population of the territory. With the UN fig 
leaf in place, the Zionists sent agents such as Golda Meir to the U. S. to solicit money to buy arms 
for use in a campaign of forthright collectivized terror to drive the indigenous people out of the new 
imperially decreed state.</p>
<p>Israel conducted a similar program after 1967 in the areas the mandate had reserved, nominally, it 
turned out, for the Palestinians; who soon learned that Turkish despotism had been gentle in 
comparison to Zionist settler-state occupation. Much of its energy of the state of Israel since its 
artificial conception has been directed towards seizing Palestinian land and rendering uninhabitable 
whatever fragmented portion of original, historical Palestine remains to the Palestinians. Miller 
excuses Israel's policy of mass punishment for deeds it declares to be terrorism, on the grounds that 
the Palestinian people generally are complicit in the actions of individual Palestinians. To deny this, 
he says flatly, is a &quot;lie&quot; -- thus appearing to approve of Israel's de facto position that ethnic identity 
can itself be criminal.</p>
<p>Although, with the heralded &quot;peace process,&quot; official bigotry is partially muted these days, Israel's 
recent action in sealing its borders to all Palestinians after terroristic exchanges in which many more 
Palestinians and other Arab people died than Israelis suggests the change of tone is propaganda, 
simply. &quot;Israel's actions aren't terrorism.&quot;(!) Uprooting Palestinian's orchards; stealing their water? 
Destroying their communities and economy? Establishing settler enclaves in the remnant areas, i. e., 
what is left of the lands the UN mandate reserved for Palestinians, under guard of Jewish vigilantes 
and the Israeli Defense Forces? Destroying their indigenous means of existence, to render them 
dependent on the Israeli economy for low-wage employment, then imposing 24-hour curfews on 
them <em>en masse</em> for weeks at a time? Locking up thousands of Palestinian youth in desert prison 
camps? Such actions are not terrorism! But &quot;the Israeli government established schools in Gaza and 
the West Bank, giving them [the Palestinians] education for the first time, and built utilities and 
housing...&quot; Yes, no doubt the Palestinians did get an education.</p>
<p>Israel has &quot;always lived under the world's microscope,&quot; the commentary concludes. But the world 
apparently has been asleep. Where the settler whites failed, finally, to establish a color-based 
apartheid state in South Africa, the settler-Zionists succeeded, so it seems, and we have 
religio-ethnic apartheid: an &quot;ultra&quot; variety in the West Bank and Gaza strip, since South Africa's 
material provision for the bantustans was superior to Israel's for the occupied territories; &quot;quasi&quot; for 
the Palestinians in Israel proper since although granted citizenship they are systematically 
persecuted otherwise.</p>
<p>Still, when all is said and done, focus on Israel as a perpetrator of terrorism is too narrow. 
Terrorism is stock in trade for most countries, and the one with the greatest means practices it on a 
vaster scale. No need to elaborate on the record of the U. S. in making the world safe from such 
infernal threats as Grenada, Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, Iraq -- not looking back to such ancient 
history as the racial cleansing out of Native Americans and the first great economic enterprise of 
Europe-in-America: the enslavement of Africans, the slave trade, and the super-exploitation of 
slave labor in creation of the new-model capitalist economy.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller: our world here in the USA is sustained by terror. One essential for reducing terrorism is 
to lessen reliance of our government and society on the weapons of terror: nuclear weapons, 
armaments of all kinds, armies, police, prisons, the apparatus of coercion used domestically and 
internationally, and, maybe most importantly, our slavish dependence on the labor of others. Yes, it 
will entail radical change in our government, law, and society. But we can begin.</p>

<p align=left>by nels roningen </p>
<p>In the good old U.S.A., a revolution as the top priority of the left is a recipe for disaster. It's way 
too much too expect, at least for right now. Let me tell you why. America is undoubtedly the most 
stratified society on the globe. Class, gender, sexual preference, religious preference, patriotism, 
native language, and recreational interests (hunting, sports, computer games, films) all work to 
divide us. In order for a real revolution to take place, people need to not only compromise some of 
their values and goals - they need to feel and express solidarity across all the dividing lines of 
culture. They need to be ready to stand in long lines, to go to meetings in poor communities, to<br>
ride bikes instead of burning oil. In some wretchedly poor third world country, this is not as much 
of a problem. In Haiti, for instance, so many people live in poverty that it is possible for them to 
formulate a democratic vision and act upon it - because their experience is shared. The more 
oppressed a society is economically, the more homogenous the citizens are, the more likely that 
people will work together for a social revolution. Haitians understand who their enemy is - the 
Duvalier regime aided and abetted by that big evil empire to the north, the United States. In the 
United States, the means and methods of social control have been perfected to such a degree that 
most of its citizens think that welfare mothers suck up 50% of the budget. That's quite an 
accomplishment. In the United States, someone like Newt Gingrich can call himself a revolutionary 
and the media nods soberly. Most working stiffs haven't heard of Eugene Debs. In 1993, when 
Congress was about to vote to see if the Vietnam embargo should be continued, both Democrats 
and Republicans got up on pulpits and demanded that Vietnam APOLOGIZE for the awful things it 
did to US. Right before the United States bombed Iraq back to the stone age during the Gulf War, 
George Bush invoked International Law as a justification for war - and the intellectual classes and 
the media applaud, without batting an eyelash. What a great principle! Never mind that Bush was 
condemned twice before the World Court (for invading Panama and aiding the Contras). Thus, in 
America, it is hard to see what is happening in the real world. The public relations industry, the 
entertainment industry, and most intellectuals talk in such a way as to isolate people. There are no 
resources available for people to voice their concerns, aside from the margins. Thus people are 
drawn to Rush Limbaugh - the big fat tyrant on talk radio who refuses to debate anyone - who 
disseminates disinformation which is spoon-fed to him from the Heritage Foundation and the 
Republican party. If you go to a society like Haiti, any illiterate peasant can tell you what is wrong. 
Because they all know. The means of repression there are obvious. But in the Evil Empire, which is 
controlled by (practically invisible) corporations, people aren't nearly that aware of what's 
happening. In the Evil Empire, those who really understand what is happening are mainly part of the 
establishment left - at the universities, The Nation, The Progressive Policy Institute, etc. But unlike 
the organizers in a place like Haiti or El Salvador, who end up mutilated in ditches at the road side, 
the establishment left folks are paid handsome salaries while they fight over the meaning of truth. 
The danger ISN'T at their throats. For the most part, scholars and professors and columnists are 
isolated from those they are trying to help -- union members, poor people, battered women, etc. 
Don't get me wrong. I don't want to entirely dismiss all the work the left academia is doing. The 
multicultural debate is essential. You can tell this is threatening to the mainstream establishment 
(both politicians and conservative professors) because of the way to react to it. &quot;The left is bashing 
Columbus!,&quot; &quot;They're knocking Theodore Roosevelt, calling him a racist, etc.&quot; The multiculturalists 
are feared because they are helping to determine official history, which is what social and cultural 
institutions internalize. There is still much room for criticism and inquiry. However, if the academic 
left spent as much time in the trenches as they did inside their classrooms, you'd have quite a 
change. But that's not going to happen, which is partially due to careerism. Which means that it's 
impossible to organize an effective social revolution if many of the intellectuals sympathetic to the 
movement are more interested in talking about post-modernism than they are in marching with 
Janitors For Justice. A revolution can't occur -- or at least won't change anything -- if the 
movement is organized hierarchically, with professors at the top, then organizers fresh out of 
college, and then the working stiffs they are supposed to be helping. Solidarity can only spread and 
catch fire if a movement is democratic, involves people, and tries to erase many lines. But first 
things first. Before we talk about anything, we need more than a few alternative publications. We 
need a progressive newspaper, an information revolution if you will. People need to know what's 
happening. Only THEN can we talk about revolution. </p>
<p><strong>The Pacifist Approach</strong> </p>
<p>In America, a future revolution needs to be peaceful. This is not because violence is instrically 
wrong. In many cases, violence is an appropriate means to achieving a certain end. However, in 
America, there is something called the MILITARY. It is foolish to think that we can infiltrate its 
ranks and win the troops over. The military trains people to kill - it dehumanizes them. The National 
Guard will have no trouble shooting protesters in the inner cities, especially if the people are of a 
different skin color. As of today, the L.A. police have no problems beating people without cause. 
The way we can win is NOT to go shopping for a semi-automatic at Wall Mart. The way we win is 
to lie on the train tracks together. If only one person lies down, the train will run them over. But if 
enough people lie down, the train won't be able to budge. Like Michael Albert says, major change 
is only possible if we raise the social costs of instituting a certain policy. Yes, there will be violence 
- mostly carried out by their side. But the spectacle of the U.S. military shooting protesting citizens 
in a democratic society is too much. It is bad public-relations, for one. Secondly, direct violence 
and repression will further alienate people from their elected officials and other institutions. The way 
F.D.R. dealt with the Depression was NOT to lock homeless people up. The way he dealt with it 
was to establish a social safety net, to curtail FURTHER protest. A parallel thing happened with the 
Vietnam War - where the cost of aggression was raised by domestic and civil disobedience. In this 
relatively democratic society, it is possible to push for major reforms as part of a social revolution. 
The power lies with the consumers - who can (in solidarity) shut the oil companies down by 
refusing to drive for a week. The establishment (corporations mainly) only has the power if people 
act and think a certain way. Capitalism (or what passes for it) cannot function in a militarized 
society which is tearing itself to shreds - with blood and bullets. It is helpful to them if people feel 
economically insecure (and thus lose their bargaining power). It is NOT helpful to them if people 
start doing something about their insecurity.</p>

<p><strong><img src="spkout.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32>ABOUT THE SYMBOLISM OF SPECIAL DAYS</strong></p>
<p>I hate special days, because they are hypocritical, pathetic, fake, and politically and religiously 
correct. They lead you to feel good through good actions performed only one day of the year . Is 
that enough?</p>
<p>Let's look at this week: &quot;Mothers' Day.&quot; During the entire year we should be proud of our mothers 
for all their gifts, and particularly the first one: life. Every mother is a working mother! Most of the 
time they have three jobs: working, housekeeping, and raising children. They are so awesome that I 
do not want to support the business strategy, the marketing operation, in order to sell more during 
one day, to celebrate them. I want to celebrate my mother every day through my actions and her 
understanding, rather than by buying the first object I find on the &quot;Mothers' Day&quot; rack at the mall.</p>
<p>This is the same for Valentine's Day. Do you show your love to your partner or your friends only 
once a year? One friend told me, &quot;It is a reason to be more cheesy.&quot; First, I hate to be cheesy. 
Second, cheesiness, hearts, pink, flowers, and chocolates are just an image of love presented by 
the media as an ideal. They are superficial. Did you ever think about those persons who never 
receive anything on Valentine's Day? The modern tradition is to give condoms. It is the only day 
when it is possible to have easy access to them on a campus where there are no visible condom 
distributors.</p>
<p>This reflection leads me to the subject of &quot;AIDS Awareness week,&quot; when everybody is so proud to 
wear the little red ribbons in order to show publicly their support. In fact there still is huge 
discrimination against HIV-positive persons. Socially they are still considered dirty and sexually 
deviant. Consequently, &quot;AIDS Awareness week&quot; does not have any deep meaning when it is 
difficult to find free or cheap HIV tests, when condoms and sexuality are still taboo, and when there 
is no real dialogue about drug addiction relative to AIDS -- just hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I also hate the sparkling, &quot;moral&quot; television shows that try to show Hollywood and the spectators 
their good actions and get their charity money all at the same time. The sense of guilt is proportional 
to the amount of money we see on the board. At the end we know more about the donators than 
about the symptoms of the illness or about the research 's evolution.</p>
<p>Women's Day. I have a particular hate for this one. We are a majority treated as a minority. We 
are inferiorized every day by the inequality in jobs, wages, and society. We are satirized, raped, 
abused, objectified, insulted, and hurt in many ways. Twenty-two states do not recognize domestic 
rape as illegal. And one day the male society decides to think about us after it spits on us for the 
rest of the time. I spit on Women's day!</p>
<p>And the most universal special day is Earth Day. It is so good to think about ecology once in a 
while. Every day humans consider the earth as their property, forgetting the next generations. And 
on this day each of us will make good resolutions in buying recycling containers, organic food, 
ecologically this, ecological that. We should begin by consuming less, which is the first positive step 
for any life on the earth. Additionally, ecology is also political and social. It is so funny -- I am 
becoming cynical -- to hear a politician talking on this day while he is encouraging the production 
and dissemination of nuclear wastes.</p>
<p>I could have an infinite number of examples, but most important is to understand the logic of these 
special days. Since we do not think about our bad actions every day, we take a symbolical moment 
to expiate all the sins. We choose a symbolic moment to expiate them all and clean our soul at the 
same time. Do you want to gain your Heaven in this way? It is pathetic and fake. Be realistic with 
yourself and your bad soul. Symbolism is not enough.</p>

Reflections on Human Nature and the Social Order</H2>
<H3>By Noam Chomsky</H3>
<P>In this wide-ranging intellectual tour de force, Noam Chomsky  brings
together his thoughts on topics ranging from language and human nature, to the
Middle East settlement and the role of East Timor in the New World Order. This
is the first collection of his essays in recent years to bring together
questions of philosophy, ethics, and foreign policy, and he includes his first
published remarks on political goals and visions.   </P>
<P>This book will be of great interest to both the general reader who is new to
Chomsky's political and linguistic work, and the avid Chomsky reader who will
discover new writing on current topics. It includes concise essays that explain
Chomsky's philosophical approach to linguistics and offer a short history of the
study of language; describe the role of the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; in
linguistics; and explore the way scientific questions are asked, answered, and
influenced by dominant ways of thinking.  Essays on the intellectual
responsibilities of writers and on Chomsky's own political goals and visions
provide a bridge from his chapters on human nature to four strong pieces on
issues in international affairs.</P>
<P>Whether he is looking at the Middle East, the relationship of Democracy and
markets in the New World Order, or human rights violations in East Timor,
Chomsky draws links between foreign policy decisions, the state of intellectual
culture, the role of the media, and the potential for free and democratic
societies to understand and counter the heinous acts being committed in their
name. Chomsky's refreshingly clear views of the world and the nature of things
are supported by a wealth of detail.</P>
<P><I>A world renowned linguist and outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy
and the mass media, Noam Chomsky has served as Institute Professor of the
Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT. According to the Arts and
Humanities Citation Index, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any
other living scholar between 1980 and 1992. He has published nine books with
South End Press.</I></P>

Emerging Social Justice Movements in Communities of Color</H2>
<H3>Edited by John Anner</H3>
<P>Beyond Identity Politics: Emerging Social Justice Movements in Communities
of Color provides a long-awaited roadmap to the grassroots social justice
movements of the 1990s and beyond. 
</P>
<P>Rapidly changing urban demographics, downsized government programs, and
economic globalization require new social justice strategies and new organizing
methods that go beyond identity politics. This anthology of new and previously
published essays describes how organizers are building sophisticated, successful
multiracial political organizations in low-income communities and communities of
color. With their vitality, complexity, and fluidity, these new political
formations are, in fact, transcending the politics of identity and redefining
the very meaning of the phrase of &quot;community organizing.&quot;
</P>
<P>Culled from Third Force magazine, which is &quot;charting a new course for
leftist journalism&quot; according to Utne Reader, Beyond Identity Politics
describes a strikingly diverse array of struggles: Korean workers fighting both
Korean business owners and anti-Asian prejudice, Latinos creatively organizing
communities on both sides of the border, a national campaign based in inner
cities combining police accountability with crime prevention, Native Americans
forming a powerful anti-toxics network, artists and community organizers joining
forces to stop violent images of Asian women, and much more.
</P>
<P>According to Third Force editor John Anner, the face of activism in the next
century will be more democratic, more gender-balanced, more gay-positive, more
multi-lingual and more multicultural--effectively fusing the politics of
interest with the politics of identity. In an era when the right wing seems to
be winning all battles, Beyond Identity Politics presents a critical inside look
at progressive victories.
</P>
<P><I>John Anner is editor of Third Force magazine.</I></P>

Women's Poverty in the United States</H2>
<H3>Edited by Diane Dujon and Ann Withorn</H3>
<P>Welfare reform is once again on the national agenda, and as the debate
unfolds, it is very important to keep the needs of women and children, the
fastest growing population of those in poverty, central to the debate. For
Crying Out Loud challenges the ways that the assault on welfare places blame on
women's shoulders, and ultimately judges all women for the failures of the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>This anthology shows that the situation facing poor women continues to
deteriorate and that their concerns are often denied and misunderstood by
politicians, policy makers, and the media. Although many believe that government
expenditures for the poor are running rampant, in reality only one of every
eight dollares of federal entitlement outlays goes to those living in poverty.
In fact, the rich are subsidized by the government at a greater level than the
poor.</P>
<P>For Crying Out Loud, through the multiplicity of voices addresses  the
complex reasons that women find themselves poor, and the richness of their
efforts to transcend their adversity. This collection trys to move the focus of
the debate away form eliminating welfare to eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>The writers in this anthology begin to unsnarl the tangled skeins of women's
poverty and weave a richer tapestry, one that presents a vivid picture of
economic, social, and psychological dimensions of economic deprivation. Neither
a laundry list of woes nor a detached academic survey, For Crying Out Loud
combines powerful personal accounts with systematic analysis to present a broad
view, one that includes single mothers, aging widows, black women, Latinas, and
rural women, in a wide-range lens.
</P>
<P>This collection does more than catalog women's strengths and the
difficulties of poverty: its authors review &quot;traditional solutions&quot; to
women's poverty, such as job programs, welfare, and electoral politics, with an
urge to see beyond them to more fundamental change. For Crying Out Loud brings
together a diverse group of authors, including well-known writers and activists
such as Mimi Abramovitz, Frances Fox Piven, and Marian Kramer. 
</P>
<P><I>Diane Dujon is a longtime welfare rights organizer, writer, and former
welfare recipient. Dujon is an administrator at the College of Public and
Community Service at the University of Massachusetts/ Boston. She has worked on
the National Up and Out of Poverty campaigns and is involved with Boston Jobs
for Peace, the Women's Institute for New Growth and Support, and Survival News.</I></P>

Confronting the Prison Crisis</H2>
<H3>Edited by Elihu Rosenblatt</H3>
<P>Politicians and the mass media have recently ushered in an enormous wave of
fear about violent crime. Meanwhile, the reality of the criminal prosecution
system remains carefully hidden from public understanding by the same
individuals and institutions in big business and government who manufacture
consent and engineer mass culture. 
</P>
<P>This remarkable anthology, edited by the coordinator of the Prison Activist
Resource Center (PARC), takes the discussion of crime out of the realm of false
debate fostered by an increasingly conservative and punitive state, and exposes
the economic and political realities behind the imprisonment of astounding
numbers of the working class, working poor, and people of color. 
</P>
<P>
The popular obsession with crime serves as a smokescreen to divert our attention
and energies from confronting the underlying causes for increasing violence in
our society. Criminal Injustice argues that we must counter the mythology of
crime hype by exposing and educating against the real dangers people face, such
as poverty, police abuse, and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>As thorough as it is insightful, this book examines issues ranging from the
role of prisons in the repression of activists to the health crisis behind bars.
It discusses women in prison, the death penalty, the rise of maximum security
control units, and political prisoners and prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>The contributors are articulate commentators on U.S. social, political, and
economic realities who provide important statistics and cogent analyses which
are accessible to the general reader and essential to scholars and activists.
</P>
<P>Prisons can be seen as a barometer for all that is ill at the core of our
society. Thus, academics in the fields of Sociology, African-American Studies,
or Political Science, as well as organizers working around issues as diverse as
environmental justice, housing, or reproductive rights will find this tremendous
resource indispensable in informing, inspiring, and providing direction for
action.

<H3>By Roy Morrison</H3>
<P>&quot;This book is about building better lives, creating and nurturing
ecological communities; transforming the world...It is the adventure of family,
of pleasure, of rediscovering our lives. Come walk and climb and sit quietly
with me.&quot; -Roy Morrison, from the preface to Ecological Democracy</P>
<P>In this provocative, creative, and relevatory work, Roy Morrison explains in
practical and theoretical terms how to build an ecological democracy. Morrison's
heartening description of community-based democratic social practice offers a
realistic alternative to Newt Gingrich's right-wing nightmares and Bill
Clinton's neo-liberal dreams.</P>
<P>Offering a broad-based critique of industrialism, Morrison explores
currently emerging ecological democracies, such as the Mondragon Cooperative
system in Spain, the Seikatsu Cooperative Clubs in Japan, and Coop Atlantic in
Canada. He outlines a dramatically revitalized participatory democracy--which
includes community control of finances, a social wage, cooperative economies,
demilitarization, and a solar transition--and shows how to get there from here.</P>
<P>Written from the perspective of a longtime peace and antinuclear activist,
Ecological Democracy is an essential book not only for those concerned with
society's industrial crisis, but for those who want to build a just and
sustainable future.</P>
<P><I>Roy Morrison, a longtime peace and antinuclear activist, is the author
of We Build the Road as We Travel: Mondragon, A Cooperative Social System. He
lives in Warner, New Hampshire.</I></P>

<H2>Dangerous Crossroads</H2>
<H3>By the North American Congress on Latin America</H3>
<P>
This book--the first to analyze Haiti after the U.S. occupation--gives us the
background and context we need to understand the ongoing crisis in the current
post-Cold War hot spot. <I>Haiti: Dangerous Crossroad</I>s is a succinct
history and up-to-date analysis of the tragic betrayal of Haitian democracy.
Starting with the 19th century War of Independence, through the Duvalier
dynasty, the election of Aristide, the coup, and the current intervention, this
volume traces Haiti's tireless efforts to bring about democracy--and the equally
tireless efforts of those determined to squash it.</P>
<P><I>Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</I> gathers together the most reliable
information and most comprehensive analysis of Haiti that the U.S. Left has to
offer. The Haitian crisis has its roots in colonial times, came of age in the
era of gun-boat diplomacy, and exemplified Cold War policy. Its denouement today
is paradigmatic of the &quot;new world order.&quot; It is therefore essential
reading not only for those wanting to gain a deeper understanding of Haiti, but
also for anyone trying to grasp the complexities of post Cold War geopolitics.</P>
<P>NACLA is an independent, non-profit research organization founded in 1966.
The bimonthly <I>NACLA Report on the Americas</I> is the most widely read
English-language magazine on Latin America and the Caribbean. The editors of
<I>Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</I> are Mark Fried, Pierre LaRamee, Deidre
McFadyen, and Fred Rosen.</P>

<H1>Chaos or Community </H1>
<HR>
<H2>Seeking Solutions, Not Scapegoats to Bad Economics</H2>
<H3>By Holly Sklar</H3>
<P>Americans are angry and confused about the state of the economy. The choice
is increasingly a dead-end job or no job, whether the economy is &quot;strong&quot;
or in recession. Wages are way down for younger generations. Once thriving
communities are in decline. Like no other book, <I></I> clears up the confusion
and offers urgent solutions. It has a uniquely sweeping grasp of national and
international economic trends, and how their social and political implications
are felt by the person on the street.</P>
<P>Sklar tells how blame for illegitimate economics is deflected with racist
and sexist scapegoating.  The shrinking American middle class is misled into
thinking those below them on the economic ladder are pulling them down. People
who should be working together to transform harmful economic policies are
instead turning on each other. The &quot;War on Poverty&quot; has given way to
the rollback of welfare. Millions of young people are being written off. Instead
of full employment, the United States has full prisons. The military budget
continues waging the Cold War, while needed programs to prevent violence and
invest in people are being sacrificed. Echoing Martin Luther King's eloquent
appeal to choose community over chaos before it's too late, Sklar offers crucial
steps for changing course, protecting livelihoods, and forging true security and
opportunity.</P>
<P>Holly Sklar's previous works include <I>Streets of Hope: The Fall and Rise
of an Urban Neighborhood</I> (co-authored) and
<I>Trilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World
Management</I>, the far-reaching book that foretold the New World Order. She is
a columnist for <I>Z</I> Magazine and has contributed to numerous books and
periodicals, including <I>The Nation,</I> the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> and
<I>USA Today</I>.</P>

<H1>Leasing the Ivory Tower</H1>   
<IMG SRC="lease2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<H2>The Corporate Takeover of Academia</H2>
<H3>By Lawrence C. Soley</H3>
<P>While a few incidents of &quot;political correctness&quot; have received
lavish attention from the mass media, the corporate buyout of academia has gone
nearly unnoticed.  In <I>Leasing the Ivory Tower,</I> Soley exhaustively
documents how corporations, the military, and right-wing foundations have
quietly seized control of our institutions of higher learning. While the news
media have diverted public attention with exaggerated claims of a leftist
takeover of the university, financially strained colleges and universities
working in service of corporations, Soley argues, have dealt a massive betrayal
to the students and taxpayers who pick up the bill. </P>
<P>Award winning writer Lawrence Soley gives the dirty details on campuses
nationwide, including Columbia, Yale, Harvard, MIT, Michigan State, Johns
Hopkins, University of Arizona, Catholic University, Brigham Young, and
University of California. Impassioned, outraged, and meticulously documented,
<I>Leasing the Ivory Tower</I>  exposes the growing corporate threats to the
future of intellectual inquiry and civil society itself.</P>
<P>Lawrence C. Soley has taught at the University of Alabama, University of
Georgia, Penn State, and the City University of New York.  He currently teaches
at Marquette University in Milwaukee.  Soley's previous books include The <I>News
Shapers </I>(Praeger, 1992),<I>
 Radio Warfare</I> (Praeger, 1989), and
<I>Clandestine Radio Broadcasting</I> (Praeger, 1987), which was selected as
one of the &quot;outstanding&quot; books of 1987 by Choice magazine.  With
Village Voice reporter Marc Cooper, Soley received the prestigious Sigma Delta
Chi Award for a Mother Jones article about the small group of &quot;experts&quot;
repeatedly quoted by television news reporters.  In 1993, Soley and former
Marquette University professor Bob Craig received the American Academy of
Advertising's &quot;Best Article Award&quot; for a research report titled &quot;Advertising
Pressures on Newspapers.&quot; </P>

<P><I><A NAME="martyjezer">Marty Jezer</A></I></P>
<P>An engaging and accessibly written discussion of the roots of the civil
rights and peace movements, the counter-culture, and the New Left in the 1950s
and early 1960s. &quot;Carefully documents America's transformation from a
nation flush with New Deal optimism and victory over the Axis to a
self-lobotomized imperial fortress so twisted with fear of &quot;alien&quot;
ideologies that it nearly choked itself to spiritual death. &#133; In a
pathbreaking chapter on agriculture, Jezer illustrates the postwar decimation of
the family farm and the mass introduction of chemical pesticides and herbicides
which would soon lead to a global crisis. &#133; To his credit, he also shows
what was really alive back then, what gave birth to the liberating outburst of
the 1960s. &#133; Marty Jezer has tied those strains&#151;dark and light&#151;into
a highly readable volume.&quot; &#151;Harvey Wasserman</P>

centuries. These stories are vital background for anyone organzing, learning or

bourgeois ideology and class cohesion in this country, the intellectual
foundations of racism and the treatment of women in prestigious institutions.&quot;&#151;The

Glick's smart, concise War at Home gives ample proof that these friends of yours
are not simply demonstrating their irrational fears. Nor are they suffering from
delusions of grandeur about their political work. &#133; Thankfully, though,
Glick does more than frighten us and run. Strategies for dealing with possibly
FBI-fabricated rumors, forged or anonymous letters, and suspected infiltrators
provide a sophisticated and even serene finale to his book. &#133; Commit all
his precautions to memory. Something tells me innumerable copies of Glick's
checklist will be needed before the approaching gay and/or angry 90s are over.&quot;

<H3><A NAME="year501">Year 501: The Conquest Continues</A></H3>
<P><I>Noam Chomsky</I></P>
<P>With chapters on Haiti, Latin America, the new global economic order, the
Third World at home, and much more, this is a powerful treatise on the
not-so-new world order. &quot;Year 501 is another awesome achievement by Noam
Chomsky. It is a devastating array of information about the U.S. role in the
world, placed in the long historical perspective of 500 years that followed the
voyages of Columbus. The result is a wonderful single-volume education in
history and world politics.&quot; &#151;Howard Zinn</P>

<H3><A NAME="rethinkingcamelot">Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietname War, and
U.S. Political Culture</A></H3>
<P><I>Noam Chomsky</I></P>
<P>&quot;This book is a thorough analysis of John F. Kennedy's role in the U.S.
invasion of Vietnam and a probing reflection of the elite political culture that
allowed and encouraged the Cold War. Particularly important is his careful
delineation of the debate over whether Kennedy was about to withdraw from
Vietnam, a decision (some argue) aborted by his assassination in November 1963,
and Chomsky's analysis of the gulf between the general public and policy-making
elites. His larger argument is that Vietnam is just one more phase in the
European conquest that began 501 years ago. &#133; An interesting work not only
for the history it explores, but also as a study of how various individuals and
groups write and interpret history.&quot; &#151;Choice</P>

explores the history of  &quot;white&quot; consciousness in the United States,
the Civil Rights Movement, Southern culture,  neo-Nazis and the Klan, and
lesbian-feminism.</P>

<P>From Civil Rights to Black Liberation is one of the few books that offers
historical research about the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), a
revolutionary organization founded by Malcolm X and rooted in traditions of
black nationalism, self-determination, and human rights.  The author establishes
the relevance of Malcolm's political legacy for the task of rebuilding the
movement for Black liberation almost thirty years after his assassination. Sales
intelligently argues why he considers Malcolm X more than an icon for
revolutionary African American youth; he asserts that he was a &quot;multi-faceted
thinker and organizer who is worthy of serious study by scholars, activists, and
anyone looking to understand our world today.&quot; &#151;Publishers Weekly</P>

<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Chaos or Community?</H1>
<H2>By Holly Sklar</H2>
<P>The American Dream&#151;always an impossible dream for many&#151;is dying a
slow death. As the systemic causes go untreated, a host of local and national
leaders are peddling the snake oil of scapegoating. We don't have to swallow it.
Together, we can find real remedies to our common problems.</P>
<P>Three decades ago, in Where Do We Go From Here, Martin Luther King spoke
prophetically about polarizing national and international trends. He urged us to
choose community over chaos:</P>
<P>&quot;A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring
contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look at
thousands of working people displaced from their jobs with reduced incomes as a
result of automation while the profits of the employers remain intact, and say &quot;This
is not just.</P>
<P>&quot;We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today&#133;We still
have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. This may
well be mankind's last chance to choose between chaos and community.&quot;</P>
<P>In the last three decades, humankind has taken giant steps toward community&#151;and
chaos. The Cold War threat of coannihilation has faded, but many nations are
wracked by internal conflict. The United States grows increasingly disunited.
The ruinous social and economic trends that King warned us about have
intensified. Wealth is not trickling down. It is flooding upward. Real wages for
average workers have plummeted&#151;despite rising productivity. Many corporate
executives make more in a week than their workers make in a year. Unemployment
is high whether the economy is in recession or &quot;recovery.&quot; The &quot;War
on Poverty&quot; has given way to the escalating war on the poor. Once-thriving
communities are in decline.</P>
<P>Economic inequality is now so extreme that the wealthiest 1 percent of
American families have nearly as much as the entire bottom 95 percent. More than
a fifth of all children are living in poverty in this, the world's richest
nation. That's according to the government, which undercounts both poverty and
unemployment. Downward mobility has become the legacy for younger generations.
Neither two incomes, nor college degrees assure that younger families will ever
match their parents' living standards.</P>
<P>For more and more people, a job is not a ticket out of poverty, but into the
ranks of the working poor. Jobs and wages are being downsized in the &quot;leaner,
meaner&quot; world of global corporate restructuring. Corporations are
aggressively automating and shifting operations among cities, states and nations
in a continual search for greater public subsidies and lower-cost labor.
Full-time jobs are becoming scarcer as corporations shape a cheaper, more
disposable workforce of temporary workers, part-timers and other &quot;contingent
workers.&quot;</P>
<P>Workers are increasingly expected to migrate from job to job, at low and
variable wage rates, without paid vacation, much less a pension. How can they
care for themselves and their families, maintain a home, pay for college, save
for retirement, plan a future? How do we build strong communities? What about
the millions of people without jobs? This brand of economics is a prescription
for chaos.</P>
<P>The cycle of unequal opportunity is intensifying. Its beneficiaries often
slander those most systematically undervalued, underpaid, underemployed,
underfinanced, underinsured, underrated and otherwise underserved and undermined&#151;as
undeserving and underclass, impoverished in moral values and lacking the proper
&quot;work ethic.&quot; The angry, shrinking middle class is misled into
thinking that those lower on the economic ladder are pulling them down, when in
reality those on top are rising at the expense of those below. People who should
be working together to transform the economic policies that are hurting them are
instead turning hatefully on each other.</P>
<P>Instead of full employment, the United States has full prisons. It imprisons
Black men at a much higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid. The
military budget continues consuming resources at Cold War levels, while programs
to prevent violence and invest in people, infrastructure and the environment are
sacrificed on the altar of deficit reduction.</P>
<P>
Instead of dedicating itself to equal opportunity for children, society is
living a self-fulfilling prophecy: labeling more children as illegitimate,
expecting more children to fail, and declaring more children the enemy. A
society which sees a great number of its children as hopeless, is a society
without hope for the future.</P>
<P>To realize community over chaos we must revitalize democracy with plain talk
about who really benefits and who loses from government policy. We need vigorous
debate over how to reshape policy in the public interest&#151;not the pseudo
debate of false campaign promises, negative political ads and talk radio
hate-mongering.</P>
<P>Rights and &quot;entitlements&quot; taken for granted today&#151;among them
the eight-hour day, minimum wage, Social Security and the right of workers to
organize and bargain collectively&#151;were obtained in the face of strong
opposition. Many of these achievements are being eroded. Demagoguery is
threatening democracy. To realize community over chaos we must not only protect
old gains, but forge new social, political and economic rights for the 21st
century.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FBI Secrets Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from FBI Secrets</H1>
<H2>BY M. Wesley Swearingen</H2>
<P>I became a Special Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in
1951. I did not know, when I joined, that I would learn the expertise of
burglary, or that former Director J. Edgar Hoover would instruct agents to
violate extortion and kidnapping laws. I did not know then that FBI agents would
plot assassinations of American citizens and put innocent individuals in jail
just because their skin is black or because they are Native Americans.</P>
<P>I retired in May 1977, completely disillusioned after more than twenty-five
years of service. I suffered through over a year of sleepless nights, countless
nightmares, and tortured conversations with family and friends before I took the
irreversible step of publicly condemning an organization I once had loved and
respected. </P>
<P>Because of the FBI's widespread dishonesty and corruption, by the end of my
tenure there I had lost the ability to distinguish between different levels of
corruption. In the beginning, when I saw new agents being encouraged to cheat on
their examinations, I was shocked. But after twenty years of seeing a whole
bureau cheat on Inspectors' examinations, concoct fictitious informants,
manufacture phony informant reports, and create false statistics, even the most
egregious levels of corruption&#151;when top FBI officials lied to the courts,
the Department of Justice, and to the U.S. Congress&#151;no longer shocked me.
After witnessing twenty years of FBI wrongdoing, I had accepted it as a means to
survive in the bureau. So, when Elmer Pratt, the Los Angeles leader of the Black
Panther Party, was framed for murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1972 as
a target of COINTELPRO, I saw this wrongdoing as about a two on a scale of one
to ten.</P>
<P>Consequently, I did not call the attorney general of the United States or
the judge who was trying the case when I learned Pratt was to be framed and
imprisoned. Many critics have asked me how I could consciously and willingly
violate laws I had sworn to uphold. I was a young overzealous patriot, a real &quot;Yankee
Doodle Dandy&quot; who loved his country. I was a dangerous person to have in
public service because when there appeared to be a threat to our government, I
placed the other agents and myself above the law. We did what we thought was
good for the country. The other agents and I were the epitome of American naval
hero Commodore Stephen Decatur, who said in 1816, &quot;Our country, right or
wrong.&quot; Special Agent Joseph G. Deegan, chief of extremist investigations
at FBI headquarters, said at a special security conference in the Los Angeles
FBI field office in 1977, after his testimony before the Church Committee: &quot;We
are the only ones who know what is good for the country, and we are the only
ones who can do anything about it.&quot; The thought of becoming a
whistle-blower was against everything I had ever believed in. It was the hardest
decision of my life. I reviewed in my mind what I thought might be the reactions
of nearly every friend I ever had, from childhood to my retirement. What would
they think? What would they  say? The answers were always the same. What was
most important to me was what I thought of myself. If I were ever to have any
self-respect, I had to square my experience in the FBI with my conscience and my
country. Eighteen years after my retirement I still ponder my decision to become
a whistle-blower.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Haiti Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</H1>
<H2>
BY NACLA</H2>
<P>Not so long ago, most everyone on the Left agreed that U.S. intervention in
the internal affairs of another country should be opposed a priori. The case of
Haiti shattered that consensus. In the topsy-turvy world of post-Cold War
politics, U.S. troops landed on Haiti's shores in September 1994 to remove a
right-wing military dictatorship and restore a popularly elected leftist priest
to power. What did this intervention mean? Did such an action merit our cautious
support?</P>
<P>The issue divided the Lavalas alliance that voted Father Jean-Bertrand
Aristide into presidential office, and it divided the U.S. Left. At one end of
the spectrum were those who opposed intervention in Haiti in any form, whether
by U.S. troops or UN and Organization of American States (OAS) human rights
monitors. They recalled recent U.S. interventions in Latin America, as well as
the last time the U.S. Marines landed on Haitian shores in 1915 and hunkered
down for a nineteen-year occupation. On the other end were those who thought
only the United States had the clout, not to mention a moral responsibility, to
restore Aristide to office.</P>
<P>A related debate concerned whether the answer to Haiti's crisis lay in the
diplomatic suites of Washington or in the Haitian streets and mountains. Many in
the Haitian popular movement and some sectors of the U.S. Left believed that
only armed struggle or other forms of popular mobilization within Haiti could
break the back of military domination. Others placed their faith in negotiations
and a transition to democracy under U.S. tutelage.</P>
<P>Easy answers to the Haitian crisis have proven elusive. Haitian&#151;and
Latin American&#151;history has taught us not to expect the United States to
ride in on a white horse and altruistically save the day for democracy. Indeed,
the United States has rarely aided a government with a progressive agenda at
odds with U.S. business interests. Even the New York Times has reported on U.S.
support for Haiti's corrupt military rulers over the years. Confusing matters
further, U.S. policymakers seemed at war with themselves during Aristide's years
in exile. On the one hand, the United States said it supported the Haitian
president's return and was a driving force in negotiations to end military rule.
Yet, on the other hand, the U.S. government systematically subverted Aristide
and appeared to favor Lieutenant General Raoul C&eacute;dras, who headed the
September 1991 coup, and his cronies. </P>
<P>In many respects, Haiti is a paradigm of the new potentials and liabilities
of U.S. foreign policy in the 1990s. Without the Soviet Union as a
countervailing superpower, and therefore without anti-communist dogma to neatly
divide the world into friends and enemies, the United States has had to readjust
its ideological compass. While there is substantial continuity within planning
circles concerning the definition of the national interest, U.S. policymakers
now debate where significant U.S. interests lie, and how far the scope of U.S.
military power should reach more vociferously. Even where there is consensus,
new geopolitical strategies, diplomatic tactics and political-ideological
rationales have been brought into play. The crisis in Haiti has forced U.S.
planners to directly confront these issues. </P>
<P>The conservative media tend to depict Haiti as a hopeless quagmire into
which the United States has blindly waded. Anxiously awaiting the pull-out of
U.S. troops in late March 1995, they are primed to explode with righteous wrath
if a single U.S. soldier's life is lost in what one writer has coined &quot;the
immaculate invasion.&quot; By contrast, those in the liberal press typically
applaud the Clinton Adminstration for doing its duty to &quot;restore democracy&quot;
in Haiti. This school of thought empathizes, however, with an occupying force
that does not want to take on difficult tasks&#151;such as disarming the
paramilitary attach&eacute;s&#151;that might endanger the lives of U.S.
soldiers. </P>
<P>Despite their obvious differences, conservatives and liberals share one
premise: they consider the United States to be an unalloyed force for good in
Haiti. Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads&#151;the first book to analyze Haiti after
the U.S. intervention&#151;questions that central assumption by detailing the
role the United States played in creating the crisis it is now trying to
resolve. To counter the mainstream media's characteristic historical amnesia,
this volume places current events within the wider context of twentieth-century
Haitian history. Starting with the nineteenth-century War of Independence,
through the Duvalier dynasty, the election of Aristide, the coup, and the
current intervention, this volume traces the Haitian majority's tireless efforts
to bring about democracy&#151;and the equally tireless efforts of those
determined to squash it. </P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Leasing Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Leasing the Ivory Tower</H1>
<H2>BY Lawrence C. Soley</H2>
<P>Taking their cues from conservative critics, the media have dwelled almost
exclusively on a few stories about political correctness (PC), and in so doing
have missed the real story about academe. The real story is about university
physics and electrical engineering departments being seduced by Pentagon
contracts; molecular biology, biochemistry, and medicine departments being wooed
by drug companies and biotech firms; and university computer science departments
being in bed with Big Blue and a few high-tech chip makers. The story about
universities in the 1980s and 1990s is that they will turn a trick for anybody
with money to invest; and the only ones with money are corporations,
millionaires, and foundations. These investments in universities have
dramatically changed the mission of higher education; they have led universities
to attend to the interests of their well-heeled patrons, rather than those of
students.</P>
<P>The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) typifies in many ways
what has happened to universities in the real world outside anti-PC rhetoric.
Corporations have contracted with the university for research, hired its
professors as consultants, and endowed professorships. Foundations have
established independently operating fiefdoms on the UCLA campus, and tycoons
have become the advisors and namesakes of departments.16 Moreover, several other
universities have gone further than just naming professorships and departments
after millionaires and corporations, as UCLA has. For example, Glassboro State
College in Glassboro, New Jersey changed its name to Rowan College after
receiving $100 million from industrialist Henry M. Rowan, the founder of a
furnace company. Not since the Stalin era in the Soviet Union has a living
individual had a monument of this size named after him.</P>
<P>When donations are made to higher education by corporations, the donors
often receive massive benefits, even when strings aren't attached. In addition
to tax write-offs, corporations get enormous public relations benefits from
their donations. Philip Morris's Miller Brewing Company, for example, donates
$150,000 annually to the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, which provides
scholarships to African-American students. But Miller also spends more than
$300,000 a year to advertise the program and its contributions, and these
advertisements carry the Miller logo.</P>
<P>University administrators claim that such corporate and foundation money is
accepted without strings. But this claim doesn't mean that universities are
independent of their benefactors, according to Cal Bradford, a former fellow at
the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute for Public Policy. Bradford
should know. His contract wasn't extended after he criticized the university's
ties to corporations. The outside funds &quot;determine what universities will
teach and research, what direction the university will take,&quot; Bradford
says. &quot;If universities would decide that they need an endowed chair in
English, and then try to raise the money for it, it would be one thing. But
that's not what happens. Corporate donors decide to fund chairs in areas that
they want research done. Their decisions decide which topics universities
explore and which aren't.&quot;</P>
<P>In some cases, the influence of donors is direct rather than subtle: *At the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the College of Hotel Administration negotiated a
$2 million &quot;gift&quot; from the Japanese-owned ACE Denken Company, which
manufactures slot machines. The arrangement ties the college to ACE Denken in
perpetuity, pending a review every five years. The $2 million donation endowed a
doctoral program in hotel administration. For the gift, university
administrators promised to publish an annual monograph named for ACE on &quot;issues
facing the casino and gaming industry,&quot; to sponsor an annual seminar for
ACE management and their friends on a topic picked by ACE, and to present ACE
with an annual report on developments in gambling technology. The board of
regents of the university initially rejected the deal, calling it a contract,
not a gift. After some negotiations, however, they agreed to the deal with a few
weak restrictions.</P>
<P>*The $100 million gift to Glassboro State College from Henry M. Rowan in
1992 came with political strings explicitly attached. One part of the gift
consisted of $3 million in scholarships for the children of Rowan's employees.
However, the scholarships were only for children of Rowan's nonunion employees.
Rowan stated that he would make scholarships available to employees &quot;who
have worked harmoniously with their company,&quot; not those who &quot;won their
contracts through threats and strikes.&quot;20 Glassboro State College officials
accepted this discriminatory policy, stating that they didn't &quot;have any
problem with an individual giving to defined groups as long as it's not in
opposition to the interests of the institution.&quot; Union officials denounced
the agreement as typical of Rowan's antiunionism.21 Eventually, pressures from
unions, state legislators, and the media, not from the university, forced Rowan
to reverse his antiunion stance and allow scholarships to be given to his union
employees, too. Despite this reversal, Glassboro State's pronouncement indicates
the unprincipled positions that universities are willing to embrace in order to
get their hands on corporate and tycoon money.</P>
<P>
Glassboro State is not an isolated case. Universities are constantly searching
for new funding. One reason university administrators have strongly supported
the emphasis on research and other noninstructional projects at their
institutions&#151;even at the expense of teaching&#151;is that such projects are
perceived to enhance a university's prestige and to have the potential of
bringing in large sums of money. Universities are typically classified as to
whether they are a &quot;research institution,&quot; &quot;liberal arts college&quot;
or another class of university.22 Georgetown, Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, also in
Cambridge), Stanford, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut are classed
as research institutions, and most administrators would like to see their
universities described as being in the same class as these institutions.</P>
<P>In addition to prestige, research can potentially lead to direct economic
benefits. The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980
stimulated a race by universities to secure patents on their research
discoveries, in the belief that the patents might someday be valuable. Between
1986 and 1989, the number of patents issued to universities doubled from 619 to
1,145.23 The number of patents that universities secure, rather than the success
universities have in educating students, is now used as a measure by which
university administrators demonstrate their accomplishments.</P>
<P>Administrators see these patents as a long-run method for generating
revenues, but this has so far proved to be an illusion. Universities typically
have received little money from the research produced in their laboratories.
When universities do get large royalties, they usually come at a very high cost
to the public, as Michigan State University's (MSU) cisplatin patent
demonstrates. MSU received over $60 million in royalties from Bristol-Meyers
during the past decade for its patent on cisplatin, an anti-cancer drug used for
treating bladder, testicular, and ovarian cancers. Bristol-Myers Squibb received
an exclusive license to sell cisplatin (which means that only Bristol-Myers can
produce the drug) even though MSU developed cisplatin with federal funding.26
Bristol-Myers's profits from the drug have been enormous because it has had a
monopoly on production and sales.</P>
<P>Government actions have promoted these increasing ties between business and
universities. Although universities have always pandered to wealthy patrons,
universities' toadyism intensified after President Reagan slashed spending on
domestic programs. Reagan's cuts to student loans and funding for grant-giving
agencies put the pinch on universities. For example, the college work-study
program was cut by 26.5 percent, after adjusting for inflation. At the NIH,
budget cuts resulted in the funding of just 20 percent of highly meritorious
research proposals, as opposed to the 45-55 percent funded before Reagan took
office.</P>
<P>When grants to universities from agencies such as the NIH declined,
universities began looking to the private sector and well-funded Pentagon
programs for money. Today, some academic disciplines have become completely
enslaved to corporations and the Pentagon for research dollars. For example,
$1.8 billion dollars was allocated to university research by the Defense
Department in 1993. &quot;That money accounts for more than 80 percent of all
Federal research funds for electrical engineering, more than 70 percent of those
for materials and metallurgy, and more than 55 percent of those for computer
science,&quot; the New York Times reported.</P>
<P>Two changes in federal laws&#151;the 1980 University and Small Business
Patent Procedures Act (P.L. 96-517), which was supplemented by a 1983 executive
order extending the law to large corporations, and the 1981 Recovery Tax Act
(P.L. 97-34)&#151;also helped cultivate the current relationship between
universities and business. The 1980 law and later executive order allowed
universities to sell patent rights derived from research to corporations, even
if the federal government were the primary funder of the research that led to
the patents. The 1981 law increased corporate tax deductions for &quot;donations&quot;
made to universities.</P>
<P>These laws have made it worthwhile for corporations to get involved with
educational institutions. By sticking some of their dough into universities,
corporations are able to buy the results of university research, even though
much of the research is funded by the federal government. While federal tax
dollars fund about $7 billion worth of research, corporate dollars are used to
buy access to the results of the research&#151;at just a fraction of their
actual cost. This subsidy to corporations has had a positive impact on corporate
bottom lines, particularly in the fields of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.
Corporations have been able to shift part of their research-and-development
costs to universities, thereby increasing corporate profits.</P>

<H1>Welcome to the Web!</H1>
</CENTER>

<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The
Web is simply a
large number of pages of text and graphics that are linked together with
<b>hyperlinks</b>.
Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that
an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link:
<a href="http://www.lbbs.org/">ZNet</a>).
And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links.
Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to
follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers,
like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about
clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the
Web.

<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some
links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever you
click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come
back here by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option
on your browser.

Here are some good places to begin:</p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>

<p>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in
mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for related
sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new
links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by

<h2>Purposes and Policies</h2>

<p>Z Media Institute exists to share knowledge, skills, and
information relevant to working effectively with media in the
United States. The program emphasizes the shortcomings of
mainstream media and the possibilities of alternative media. It
is an intense 9 day gathering with courses four times each day,
and events and speakers every night. There is radio and computer
equipment on hand, for technical training, etc.</p>

<p>ZMI incorporates courses in political theory, media studies,
organizational skills, and technical skills, with project groups
in radio, print, and organizing work.</p>

<p>The goal of ZMI is to help progressive people initiate or work
more effectively within alternative media or activist
institutions, and to better media and its uses.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Financing and Budget</h2>

<p>ZMI's costs (estimated here for the June 1995 session) are
room and board for all attendees and faculty ($47,000), staff and
lecturer's fees and travel expenses ($7,500), computer rentals,
text production, and general miscellaneous costs ($3,500), for a
total of $58,000.</p>

<p>ZMI's revenues are the fees paid by students. The full price
is $1,000. Scholarships range from $250 to $750. We are still
arranging fees and acceptances for June 1995, but the goal is to
schedule income of about $60,000 for the 80 attending students. </p>

<p>There is, regrettably, no outside funding support for ZMI. On
the other hand much of the staff and faculty time is donated.</p>

<p>Anyone who wishes to help ZMI by providing funds that will
enable an expansion of scholarships, can do so by making a tax
deductible donation. Call 508-548-9063 for more information.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p>ZMI is held in Woods Hole Massachusetts. Students are housed
at a local Inn where we rent sufficient rooms. Classes are held
at a number of nearby sites. Dining is at the Swope Dining Hall,
which is part of the Marine Biology Laboratories. Courses are
held in a few sites, but mostly a large house-like structure
located on its own private beach. The whole site is on the water,
small town living. Natural, serene, a good balance for the hectic
pace of the program.</p>

<h2>When</h2>

<p>ZMI is held yearly in early June. In 1996 the session ran from
June 5 to June 14.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>The full fee for ZMI is $1,000 to cover room, board, classes,
computers, etc. Scholarships range from $250 to $500 but are in
short supply. The first payment each year is due March 1, to help
us reserve housing. All payments must be made by the sessions
opening.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Details and Applications</h2>

<p>Details and application forms appear in <em><strong>Z Magazine</strong></em>
each year, beginning in the December or January Issue. Since
there is much to fill out using a form from <em><strong>Z</strong></em>
is essential.</p>

<H1>Welcome to the Web!</H1>
</CENTER>

<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The
Web is simply a
large number of pages of text and graphics that are linked together with
<b>hyperlinks</b>.
Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that
an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link:
<a href="http://www.lbbs.org/">ZNet</a>).
And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links.
Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to
follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers,
like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about
clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the
Web.

<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some
links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever you
click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come
back here by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option
on your browser.

</ul>

<p>If you want to create your own web pages or create your own site, you
need to understand a little about the underlying language of Web design.
Here are some good places to begin:</p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>

<p>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in
mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for related
sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new
links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by

<HEAD><TITLE>LOL Guide: Other Internet Tools</TITLE></HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#3A0D9F" vlink="#AF0475" alink="#0E7F09">

<h1 align=center>Other Internet Tools</h1>

<P>The World Wide Web is only one of the many services available on LOL and
the Internet. Perhaps you've already used <b>e-mail</b> (electronic mail),
which lets you send and receive information to and from anyone on WOL or
the Internet. But while e-mail and the web are the most popular Internet
applications, there are several other tools that come in handy from time to
time.

<a name="n"> </a>
<P><b>Newsgroups</b> are global discussion forums covering all sorts of
topics, including computers, recreation, science, social issues, and an
innumerable number of other subjects. <i>Usenet,</i> the system that
carries the newsgroups, uses a hierarchical naming scheme. For example, all
the newsgroups relating to social issues begin their names with
"<tt>soc.</tt>", and all of those groups that concern cultural discussions
start with "<tt>soc.culture.</tt>", so that that group on Brazillian
culture is <tt>soc.culture.brazil</tt>, Haitian culture is
<tt>soc.culture.haiti</tt>, and so on. (Notice the use of periods to
seperate the components of each name.) With some groups, the content is
moderated (e.g. <tt>soc.feminism</tt>), but most groups have no
restrictions at all (e.g. <tt>alt.feminism</tt>). There are thousands upon
thousands of newsgroups to choose from, containing postings from around the
world. Some web browsers (including Netscape) have newsreading capabilities
built in.

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://scwww.ucs.indiana.edu/NetRsc/usenet.html">Usenet
Newsgroups: Resources</a>
<li><a href="http://gort.ucsd.edu/jj/news/eeg_69.html">EFF's (Extended)
Guide to the Internet: Usenet</a>
<li><a href="http://www.clari.net/brad/emily.html">Emily Postnews</a></b>
</ul>

<P>On LOL you have two ways to access Usenet newsgroups. Some groups are
available within LOL's forum area, for the most efficient possible access,
which you can use just as you would any other LOL forum. To access the rest
of Usenet, you can select a newsreader application from our <!--HREF
HERE-->Internet Page and install it on your computer. (We suggest <!--HERE
TOO-->Free Agent for Windows users.) Each of these applications comes with
its own instructions.

<a name="f"> </a>
<P><b>FTP</b> is a tool for transferring files. (It's short for <i>File
Transfer Protocal</i>.) You can download files on the World Wide Web (by
clicking on them), but FTP has the advantage of letting you send files to
another machine. When using FTP to connect to another machine, you need to
enter in a name and password -- don't worry, most FTP machines will let you
in if you enter "anonymous" for your name and your e-mail address for your
password. After that, FTP operates much like MS-DOS, if you've ever used
it: You type in short commands to navigate through directories and get or
put files. FTP is built in to most web browsers (though not all browsers
can send files -- you'll need a dedicated FTP program for that).

<ul>
<li><b><a
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/ftp-list/faq/faq.ht
ml">Anonymous FTP FAQ</a></b>
</ul>

<P>For Windows users LOL also provides an excellent FTP tool, called
CuteFTP, via the LOL <!--HREF HERE-->Internet Page. MAC Users can get a
comparable tool
from the LOL/ShareWorld Mac file library. Please consult the
instructions within LOL and your FTP programm's help system for more
information.

<a name="m"> </a>
<P><b>Mailing lists</b> are a special application of e-mail: You send an
e-mail message to a "listserver" (a specially configured machine) asking to
receive a particular mailing list. Then, whenever e-mail is posted to the
mailing list, the listserver will send copies to everyone on the list.
Typical mailing lists include newsletters and small discussion groups. For
example, to join ACTIV-L, a "discussion of peace, empowerment, justice and
environmental issues," send an e-mail message to <A
HREF="mailto:listserv@mizzou1.missouri.edu">listserv@mizzou1.missouri.edu</A
> containing the following text:

<blockquote>
<TT>subscribe ACTIV-L</TT>
</blockquote>

Be forewarned, however, that subscribing to too many mailing lists will
fill up your e-mail box with a large volume of mail. You can unsubscribe
from the above list by sending "<TT>signoff ACTIV-L</TT>" to the same
address. Other lists may require different commands for subscribing and
unsubscribing.

Groups</a>

of Lists</a>
<li><a href="http://www.tile.net/tile/listserv/ecology.html">Ecology
lists</b> (from tile.net)</a>
</ul>

<a name="t"> </a>
<P><b>Telnet</b> lets you "log in" to another machine on the Internet. This
is most commonly used to access "shell accounts" on UNIX machines (which
give you your own little space on a large, powerful computer), but is also
used for a variety of other applications, such as library catalog systems,
or BBS access via the Internet. LOL itself can be accessed using telnet,
including the telnet capability of our WG software for Windows.

<a name="g"> </a>
<P><b>Gopher</b> is a system that organizes information into a series of
menus. You can navigate between different machines and directories, and
retrieve files files simply by selecting from the menu choices. Think of it
as a more "user-friendly" front-end for FTP and Telnet that also integrates
information from many different sources. The World Wide Web has surpassed
Gopher in many of these functions, but there are still many valuable
resources accessible through Gopher.

<ul>
<li><b><a href="gopher://mudhoney.micro.umn.edu:70/00/Gopher.FAQ">Gopher
FAQ</a></b>
</ul>

<a name="i"> </a>
<P><b>IRC</b> (<i>Internet Relay Chat</i>) is kind of like a "live" Usenet:
The discussion groups are called "channels," and communication happens in
real time. Once you join a channel, you can type messages that appear
immediately on the screens of everyone else connected to the same channel.
There are a variety of special commands you can learn to enhance the
experience.

<ul>
<li><b><A HREF="http://www.kei.com/irc.html">IRC FAQ</A> (Frequently Asked
Questions)
<li><a
href="http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRCprimer/IRCprimer/IRCprimer.html">
A short IRC primer</a></b>
</ul>

<P>LOL provides an IRC tool, again on the <!--HREF HERE-->Internet Page. Please
consult the instructions there and in the tool's help system for further
guidance.

        <p>Michael was born April 8, 1947. His radicalization occured
        during the 1960s. His political involvements, starting
        then, have ranged from local, regional, and national organizing
        projects and campaigns, to co-founding South End Press, <strong><i>Z
        Magazine</i></strong>, Left On Line, to working on these
        projects, writing for various publications and publishers, giving
        public talks, etc.</p>

        computers and programming (windows platform, primarily),
        tennis, kayacking, and the more sedentary but no less
        challenging game of GO.</p>
        <p>Michael is also the author of numerous books, in most cases
        with his co-author Robin Hahnel. Most recently these
        include: <strong><i>Looking Forward: Participatory Economics
        in the 21st Century</i></strong><i> </i>(South End Press)
        and <strong><i>Political Economy of Participatory
        Economics</i></strong> (Princeton University Press (both
        with Robin Hahnel, co-author) and <strong><i>The Killing
        Train</i></strong><strong> </strong>(South End Press).</p>
        <p>He is currently an editorial writer and columnist for <strong><i>Z Magazine</i></strong>,
        a staff person at <em><strong>Z Magazine</strong></em>
        (with a reduced workload, however), System Operator of

<h2>ShareWorld Games</h2>
<p>Shareworld creates online systems for organizations and their constituencies. The premium is on socially conscious online 
communication and activism, but having fun is part of creating community, so games are part of the show.</p>
<p>ShareWorld is a multi-media system. We have online teleconferencing in text, graphics, and audio. We also have facilities to help 
folks meet new people, find pen pals, and learn about one another. We are developing simulation facilities for political games and 
research, but we also have games like checkers, backgammon, more interactive ones, and chess, whose window we display here. </p>
<p>These can be played live, with both players on line and moving in turn. Or you can make a move, get off, and then next you come 
on if your opponent has moved you are so notified and you can make another move. </p>
<p>Here then is what the Windows version of the chess facility looks like:</p>

<h2>ShareWorld Children's Offerings</h2>
<p>On ShareWorld we take young people seriously. They can participate in forums, of course. But they also have their own forums, 
no adults allowed. And their own pen pal system, games to play, browsing help, and school help. And for older &quot;children&quot; we are 
hard to work on an online high school system offering typical high school type courses, but with a socially conscious attitude and 
content. </p>
<p>Our systems also incorporate browser controls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Left On Line University aims to provide high quality courses across a range of disciplines 
and topics, inexpensively, and via telecommunications. In this way it provides access to 
quality faculty and classmates to people from all over the world. LOLU simultaneously raises 
consciousness and creates new ties among people who share the LOLU experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Each course runs for 10-12 weeks, the duration of each LOLU semester. </p>
<ul>
<li>Lecture courses involve weekly lectures posted by the faculty, and week-long 
discussions of the contents and derivative issues. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reading courses function similarly, but with reading assignments rather than lectures as 
the basis of discussion. </li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions as to what course shall be given rest ultimate with the LOLU staff. But anyone can 
propose a course via the Table Of Contents option, <strong>Propose</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>Courses on LOL have two sources. First, they originate from solicitation by LOL staff or 
proposals made to LOL staff. These courses are LOL sponsored. </p>
<p>Another source for courses, however, is the broader ShareWorld System. Other organizations 
with online systems in the ShareWorld community, such as The Nation Magazine, or 
Greenpeace, etc., have their own online schools, as well. All courses sponsored by any 
ShareWorld System Sponsor are made available in all the schools. </p>
<p>LOL-sponsored courses may have students, therefore, from other ShareWorld Systems, and 
LOL students can take courses in LOLU that originate not only in LOL, but also in other 
ShareWorld Systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>The current fees for course are $75 to take a course, and $30 to audit. There are special 
considerations given to those who cannot afford the going rates, though, since these fees are 
already very low, only the most extreme circumstances lead to further reductions. Funds are 
divided among faculty, sponsoring organizations/systems, and the ShareWorld project, which 
maintains the whole school structure.</p>

</P>
<P><CITE>
The following is a message from Noam Chomsky written for the AskZ&amp;C Forum,
responding to comments from another user.</CITE></P>
<HR>
<H1>
On Gingrich et. al. </H1>
<P>On Gingrich, Gramm, etc., I think you are right in saying we shouldn't
underestimate them, but what they (particularly Gingrich) say is so flaky it's
hard not to laugh. It certainly doesn't merit response. But what they are doing
makes perfect sense. Take, say, what happened when school lunches were under
discussion, and the Democrats made the tepid harassing gesture to keep the
roughly $6 billion in funding for hungry children by delaying -- DELAYING -- the
deployment of Lockheed F-22's (which we desperately need to counter the threat
of the F-16's that Lockheed is upgrading at taxpayer expense and &quot;selling&quot;
to third world dictatorships with taxpayer-guaranteed loans so they can
constitute a threat that requires us...). It was shot down very fast. Not for
nothing is Gingrich called &quot;the congressman from Lockheed.&quot; And others
also understand what happens to the high tech economy if this nonsense is
tolerated. So that's not pure flakishness, though his ravings are.</P>
<P>On protectionism, etc., I'm afraid I didn't follow. I don't see the
connection to Fish on free speech (which I didn't like, but for other reasons).
No one, not even the nuttiest &quot;libertarian,&quot; is so deluded as to think
that speech is not an act. Like most of the work in the postmodern cults, Fish
is contriving a straw man, then giving (in my view, terrible) arguments against
it. I also don't think much of his work on legal theory. But I don't follow what
that has to do with what we were discussing.</P>
<P>I also don't know what you mean by the measure of &quot;really free trade.&quot;
We know what that is well enough, abstractly, and no one advocates it for
themselves except for temporary advantage (though it's commonly rammed down the
throats of others). You seem to be interpreting my observations to this effect
as advocacy of free trade. They are not; that's an entirely separate issue.</P>
<P>I also disagree with you about restrictions on speech. Who does the
restricting? How do they get that power? If you want to restrict speech that
harms people, then let's be serious about it: for starters, bar all the
gibberish about free markets, which is used to smash people into the ground,
vastly more harmful than anything the Klan might do -- that is, shut down all
the institutions. I think you're pursuing entirely the wrong path in this
respect, irrespective of Scientific American.</P>
<P>I'm afraid I also didn't follow what you said about the sciences. As for
automatic parsers, I don't see that they have much to do with the sciences;
unless intended as a research tool, it's a form of engineering, and not a very
sophisticated form. The rest is amusing, however.</P>
<P>About the &quot;good old American contempt for theory,&quot; I suppose I
share it. To be precise, I am all in favor of &quot;theory&quot; when it is
real, and all opposed to it when it is posturing -- and there's plenty of that,
in my opinion. I don't know anything much that merits the term outside of parts
of the sciences. Most topics are just too hard, so we do basically descriptive
work (if we are intellectuals, pretending that it is &quot;theory&quot; --
that's part of the scam). If someone has some theories that have some
credibility and some conclusions, beyond the surface, in areas of human concern,
I'd like to hear them. So far, I've missed them. As for &quot;evading
philosophy,&quot; I spend a lot of my time and effort in the field called &quot;philosophy&quot;
(teaching, writing, lecturing, etc.), but don't know what it means to &quot;evade
philosophy,&quot; or not to, so honestly can't comment. I don't see what
philosophy or theory have to do with the quite serious question you raise about
public subsidies for computing initiatives. We probably disagree about this (so
I gather from your few remarks), but it's a serious question, and I don't know
of any theories or philosophy that bears on it.</P>
<P>Rawls's work is interesting, intellectually, but so remote from any
application to any actual questions that concern us that I don't see the
relevance here. The &quot;difference principle,&quot; plausible or not, isn't &quot;a
theory&quot; and doesn't require one. There are perfectly plain reasons why
those in a position to reject that operative principle do so, and why others who
seek greater justice strive for something like that. They did that before the
principle was enunciated, and do it in the same way afterwards. That's not to
say that his work is uninteresting; it's quite interesting, but in a completely
different intellectual universe.</P>
<P>It's true that FDR, JFK, etc., had corporate support, but that doesn't bear
on whether Clinton's was unusual. No one has studied the matter in depth, so
we're expressing opinions not based on extensive research (or even clear
criteria), but I think that he does have unusual corporate support, and I think
it's clear why. You're quite right about Clinton's policies -- which is one
reason why he has unusual corporate support, as the &quot;Wall St. J.&quot;
pointed out early on.</P>
<P>I also don't know what you mean by saying that the Republicans have
historically been the party of change. The parties have stood for all sorts of
things over the years, sometimes even interchanging positions overnight. Thus in
the 1984 elections, the Democrats were the party of fiscal conservatism and the
Republicans the party of borrow-and-spend abandon and forget tomorrow. The
Reaganites were also the party of extreme protectionism and state power. Right
now, the Gingrich wing of the party (there are some interesting splits within
big money circles) represents subsidies to high tech industry, fringe elements
of the economy (hedge funds, etc.), and popular forces mobilized around
religious fundamentalism, jingoist fanaticism, fear and hatred, and other such
(not unfamiliar) elements. They frighten the CEOs, in many ways -- again, not
something unprecedented -- enough so that even &quot;Fortune&quot; has been
concerned.</P>
<P>I didn't quite follow the rest, I'm afraid.</P>

About the Wilderness Society
</H1>

<p>
<HR Size="2" Width="100%" Align="Left">
<P>
   Now celebrating its 60th anniversary, The Wilderness Society is a
non-profit conservation group
dedicated to the protection of America's wild lands and wildlife.  As part
of that mission, The Society
works to foster a land ethic.  We rely on a combination of public
education, advocacy, and economic and
ecological analysis.  The Wilderness Society recognizes the importance of
broad ecosystem management
and biodiversity and is building alliances with new constituencies.

<h2>Vision</h2>

Sustaining the Community of Life:  <br>
The Wilderness Society's Vision for the Future
<p>
  In 1930, Robert Marshall declared that the only hope for the salvation of
the natural world "is the
organization of spirited people who will fight for the freedom of the
wilderness."  The Wilderness
Society, organized five years later, has fought to preserve and protect the
wilderness ever since.  But
not just the wilderness.  Aldo Leopold, one of the eight founders of The
Society, articulated an
additional purpose in his classic book, A Sand County Almanac.  He called
it the Land Ethic, which
"changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to
plain member and citizen
of it.  It implies respect for his fellow-members and also respect for the
community as such."

<p>

  This ethic is the foundation on which The Wilderness Society places its
vision for the future.  Our
vision has at its core a profound commitment to secure and maintain the
essential benefits and values
of wilderness:  habitat for the diversity of plant and animal species,
clean air and water, natural
beauty, physical recreation, spiritual renewal, scientific research, and
the opportunity to educate
ourselves and our children about the proper place of humanity in the great
tapestry of the natural
world.

<p>

  We envision a world in which streams run clean from mountain headwaters
to rivers below,
nourishing the land and all that depend upon it.  Across the American
landscape, from canyon to
prairie and forest to ocean, vigorous and healthy populations of native
plant and animal species
flourish in ecosystems sustained by ample protected wild lands.  In this
world, human beings assume
their roles as equal citizens in the great community of life, understanding
that their connection to
the natural world begins at the threshold of each home and extends in all
directions through
neighborhoods, towns, cities, and beyond to the fields, forests, mountains,
deserts, and rivers that are
a common concern of all.

<p>

  Ours is a vision, finally, of a world in which diverse human populations
and the cultural and
political institutions that guide them adhere to the principles of
sustainability and social justice and
in which people work with one another to preserve, restore, and pass on to
future generations an
environment undiminished by their
presence in it.



<p>

<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p>
        The Society has played a leadership role in virtually every major
public lands issue of the
     past 50 years.  In more recent years it has been a force behind the
passage of dozens of
     wilderness bills that have added 96 million acres to the wilderness
system since 1964.

<p>

        Other campaigns have included opposing efforts by the Reagan
administrations Interior
     Department to open wilderness areas to oil and gas development, and
pressuring the U.S.
     Forest Service to redo its roadless area evaluation in the mid-1970s.
Recently, The Society has
     worked with timber-dependent communities in the Northwest to help them
diversify their
     economies.

<p>

        In addition, The Society has been a leader in winning a number of
important legislative
     victories, including:

<ul>

     <li>Wilderness Act (1964)
     <li>National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (1968)
     <li>National Trails System Act (1968)
     <li>Endangered Species Act (1973)
     <li>Federal Land Policy and Management Act (1976)
     <li>National Forest Management Act (1976)

<h2>What Is ShareWorld?</h2>
<p><img src="images/yellhat.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32> <a href="SWindex.htm">ShareWorld</a> is an encompassing community of online systems, one of which is LOL.</p>
<p>ShareWorld creates member-only systems for diverse progressive organizations such as The 
Wilderness Society (WOL), The Nation Magazine (NOL), Greenpeace (GOL), and us (LOL), 
and that maintains and operates the technology and handles support for all these systems. 
ShareWorld also provides diverse additional content beyond that offered by each sponsoring 
organization and provides linkage between these systems for sharing of their diverse offerings 
internally. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/redhat.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32> To get a feeling for LOL's offerings consider what we call the Top Menu frame, to the upper 
left, and the Table of Contents frame, to the lower left. When you click in the top frame, new 
options appear in the lower one. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/redarr3.gif" align=baseline width=24 height=21> If you are a member of LOL, then from the two navigation frames you get one 
click access to all system offerings. </p>
<p><img src="images/redarr3.gif" align=baseline width=24 height=21> If you are a non-member visitor to LOL, in many instances of clicking on an 
option in the Table of Contents Frame to the lower left you will get a notice that you 
can't access the offering without being an LOL member and asking if you would like 
to join. </p>
<p><img src="images/redarr3.gif" align=baseline width=24 height=21> Another option, which can be more convenient at times, is to use the pull down 
menus located at the top of many pages. These too provide access to many (though 
not all) features of the system. There are three pull down menus, the first gives 
functionality inside your browser and is relevant to everyone. The second gives 
access to Windows plug-in modules, only relevant, therefore, to Windows users. 
And the third gives access to our online tutorial, again for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/redhat.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32> If you want to get a more detailed description of Left On Line and its offerings before you 
make the decision whether or not to join, the easiest way is to examine the many <strong>How To</strong> and 
other available menu options. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/redarr3.gif" align=baseline width=24 height=21> Just click <strong>How To</strong> in the top left frame, and then click each item in turn in the 
lower left Table of Contents frame to see in this window a descriptive account of 
each discussed function. </p>
<p><img src="images/redarr3.gif" align=baseline width=24 height=21> Other sources of information about LOL can be found at the <a href="SWindex.htm">ShareWorld</a> site and 
the <a href="index.htm">ZNet</a> site.</p>
<p><img src="images/redarr3.gif" align=baseline width=24 height=21> You can join LOL using the button located aat the bottom of this page, or by 
clicking the the <strong>Join LOL</strong> option in the menu frame to the upper left.</p>

<p align=center>&#160;</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p><img src="images/bluehat.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32> Left On Line is not free. To remain a member of LOL you pay $8 a month for unlimited 
access from your browser to the full LOL site. The ZNet site, in contrast, though developed and 
maintained by the same people, is free. What's the difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>The ZNet site, like many free sites, attempts to reach out to new audience and to provide 
resources to a wide array of people not yet ready to become more directly involved and 
supportive. It is a public front room to attract people to various institutions and projects, 
including LOL. It has limited offerings and requires modest maintainence. The assumption 
that users are passing through...</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The LOL site, on the other hand, is for a closed community of folks who are more 
committed to sustained and supportive involvement. It requires far more equipment and 
maintainence on our part and offers far more content, community, and functionality to you. 
The assumption is that users believe in the site, in the offerings, in the project, and want to 
not only benefit from it, but also support it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/bluehat.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32> Well and good, you might say, but still: why charge for it? Maintaining sites, whether public 
or private, involves paying fees for linkages, to maintain equipment, and, in particular, to 
continually refine and update content. Where is the money to do all this to come from? Currently, 
throughout the internet there are only three available options. </p>
<ul>
<li>Depend on ad revenue. </li>
<li>Charge users a regular fee, or </li>
<li>Have some agency or institution foot the bill as a donation. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/bluehat.gif" align=bottom width=32 height=32> We couldn't get sufficient ads for LOL even if we wanted them, but, more important, relying 
on ads would subvert our anti-commerical aims. We are not interested in selling users to 
corporate marketeers, which is precisely the business any ad driven site or periodical is in. We 
also lack a benefactor, however. So we need user support. The long and short of it, then, is this: </p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot moderate and enliven forums, provide ever-changing and enlarging online 
content, develop ever-diversifying modules and functionality, maintain reliable, robust 
equipment, attract and maintain writers and other content providers, etc., without charging a 
fee. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We therefore hope you agree with us that getting self-sustaining and even surplus generating 
progressive and left telecommunications projects and sites into operation should be a 
priority for socially conscious folks, and we hope you will join us in the effort.</li>
</ul>

<P>Now that I see there are some young people in this forum, I think it is a
perfect time for me to introduce an idea that is gaining lots of popularity
among young people. The idea is dropping out of high school -- not out of
laziness or convenience or anything like that, but as a method of self
preservation and liberation. </P>
<P>Some very bright young people are doing this for other than the traditional
reasons (need to get a job, move out of parents house, etc.) Now it is being
done to avoid indoctrination and service to the state, capital, patriarchy,
white supremacy, judeo-christian doctrine, and most of all -- adultocracy (my
word, not theirs).</P>
<P>There are already several books on the subject, mostly done by self-
publishers and the like (of course, they are far more relevant and insightful
than anything high schoolers will likely get their hands on in the classroom).
For instance, Grace Llewellyn's _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_ is among the
most popular advocates of dropping out and self-educating. The _Schoolstoppers
Textbook_ is another, this one produced by the Chicago Anarchist Youth
Federation. John Holt's _Freedom and Beyond_ is another. Several 'zines have
also appeared on the subject, including &quot;fhs&quot; (you figure it out), &quot;Unschooling
Ourselves&quot;, &quot;Drop Out&quot;, &quot;F.U.C.K.&quot;, &quot;Boy Does High
School Ever Suck&quot;, and &quot;Growing W/O Schooling&quot;. I haven't read
all of these books and 'zines myself (yet), but the jist is this:</P>
<P>A high school diploma is worthless; all it signifies is that you have been
through a sufficient amount of engineering (indoctrination, invalidation,
deprivation, coercion and abuse) at the hands of the white, male, capitalist,
authoritarian adult society. So get out!</P>
<P>What do schools have to offer young people? That is what I can't figure out.
Besides being places where kids learn John Taylor Gatto's six lessons -- (1) &quot;stay
in the class where you belong&quot;; (2) &quot;turn on and off like a light
switch&quot;; (3) &quot;...surrender your will to a predestined chain of command&quot;;
(4) &quot;only *I* determine what curriculum you will study&quot;; (5) &quot;Good
people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do&quot;; and (6) &quot;[You] are
being watched&quot; -- I really don't think much is taught at schools that could
not be learned better elsewhere. </P>
<P>And I'm not just talking about homeschooling. I'm talking about young people
teaching themselves and each other. Certain things do need to be taught by
adults. But I'd be willing to bet young people would be far more responsive to
their peers in a less structured, nonhierarchical environment. </P>
<P>As I get more information on this dropping out (up) thing, I'll be sure to
pass it on.</P>

<h2>Where</h2>
<p>ZMI is held in Wood Hole Massachusetts. Students are housed at
a local Inn where we rent sufficient rooms. Classes are held at a
number of nearby sites. Dining is at the Swope Dining Hall, which
is part of the Marine Biology Laboratories. The site is on the
water, small town living. Natural, serene, a good balance for the
hectic pace of the program.</p>
<h2>When</h2>
<p>ZMI is held yearly in June. In 1996 the session will run from
June 5 to June 14.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The full fee for ZMI is $1,000 to cover room, board, classes,
computers, etc. Scholarships range from $250 to $500 but are in
short supply. The first payment each year is due March 1, to help
us reserve housing. All payments must be made by the sessions
opening.</p>

<h2>ShareWorld's Mission</h2>
<p>Shareworld is dedicated to fostering the progressive use of telecommunications by providing 
tailor-made online systems to diverse organizations and by developing varied content and 
functionality for the community of all those systems taken together. To find out more about our 
systems, their options and functionality, and how our clients and users benefit, please choose 
<a href="serv01.htm">services</a>, here or above. There is extensive description and further links, but there are also numerous 
screen shots, and please be warned that these may take a little while to load...</p>
<p><img src="images/div.gif" alt="[HRule Image]" align=bottom width=465 height=7> </p>
<h2>ShareWorld's Company Profile</h2>
<p>ShareWorld has a variety of company components including a <a href="SWtech.htm">technical arm</a>, for developing and 
maintaining online systems, a <a href="swpromo.htm">promotion and solicitation arm</a>, for signing clients and users up to these 
various systems, and an <a href="swedit.htm">&quot;editorial&quot; arm</a>, for developing content to share on these systems. </p>
<p>ShareWorld also includes, however, all the <a href="swconsti.htm">constitutency organizations</a> who contract for systems 
and help to maintain them and provide contents for them.</p>
<p><img src="images/div.gif" alt="[HRule Image]" align=bottom width=465 height=7> </p>
<h2>ShareWorld's Clients</h2>
<p>ShareWorld contracts with client organizations to create for them and their constituencies online 
systems accessible by telnet and local call access from throughout the country. These online systems 
provide full internet connectivity, of course and interface seamlessly with the World Wide Web, but 
also provide a great deal of <a href="serv01.htm">additional functionality</a>, beyond typical web sites, rather like having an 
America On Line for your own organization.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sum total of all ShareWorld created systems constitutes a <a href="swconsti.htm">larger community of 
online projects</a>, each sharing many of its resources of the rest. </p>
<p>ShareWorld's first clients are The Nation Magazine sponsoring Nation on Line, the Wilderness 
Society sponsoring Wilderness On Line, and a consortium of organizations sponsoring Left on Line. 
A number of other potential clients are currently negotiating and additional ones are first being 
contacted.</p>
<p>For more about ShareWorld's offerings, please select <a href="serv01.htm">services</a>, either here or in the menu bar at the 
top of this page. You might also be interested in ShareWorld's Guide to the Internet, in the 
<a href="Wild/GUIDE.HTM">Wilderness Guide to the Internet</a>, in the <a href="http://www.thenation.com">Nations extensive web site</a>, or in the <a href="LOL/guide.html">Left on Line Guide to 
the Internet</a>.</p>
<p>A final, particularly nice thing about ShareWorld Systems is that you can join a ShareWorld System 
from online, even from a web browser, should you decide you wish to after reading about the 
various services and other offerings these systems have.</p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Left On Line University aims to provide high quality
    courses across a range of disciplines and topics,
    inexpensively, and via telecommunications. In this way it
    provides access to quality faculty and classmates to people
    from all over the world. LOLU simultaneously raises
    consciousness and creates new ties among people who share the
    LOLU experience. </p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>Each course runs for 10-15 weeks, the duration of each
    LOLU semester. Lecture courses involve weekly lectures posted
    by the faculty, and week-long discussions of the contents and
    derivative issues. Reading courses function similarly, but
    with reading assignments rather than lectures as the basis of
    discussion. </p>
    <p>Decisions as to what course shall be given rest ultimate
    with the LOLU staff. But the procedure for organizing and
    offering a course is to petition any LOL co-sponsor to
    sponsor the course, in which case, other than for redundancy,
    the course will appear in the LOLU catalog. </p>
    <h3>Finances</h3>
    <p>The current fees for course are $75 to take a course, and
    $30 to audit. There are special considerations given to those
    who truly cannot afford the going rates, though, since these
    fees are already very low, only the most extreme
    circumstances lead to further reductions. </p>
    <p>The revenues of LOLU are divided, 50% to the faculty and
    50% to the University Project. The faculty divide up their
    share of the income partially proportionately to the size of
    their classes, partially on a one course one share basis. </p>

    <h2>What Is Left On Line</h2>
    <p>LOL is an online community. You join LOL to gain access to
    Left On Line's diverse facilities and offerings, plus
    offerings from a number of other &quot;connected&quot;
    systems that together compose the ShareWorld community of
    online systems.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Once you do join the LOL community, you access LOL with
    your web browser, preferably Netscape or Microsoft Explorer.
    The one constraint is that you need a browser that handles
    frames, for best effect.</p>
    <p>LOL is now nearing completion and offers or will soon
    offer:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p align="left">E-Mail and diverse forums including
            participants like Noam Chomsky and Michael Albert of
            Z Magazine, with a far better interface than typical
            web systems </p>
        </li>
        <li><p align="left">Huge stores of information and
            resources, search engines, a book club (for purchases
            and discussion groups, etc.), a childrens center, an
            online school, etc. </p>
        </li>
        <li><p align="left">A congenial hassle-free environment
            with a community of mutually supportive users plus
            access to the entire encompassing <a
            href="http://www.shareworld.com"><font size="2"
            face="Arial"><strong>ShareWorld</strong></font></a>
            community and its offerings </p>
        </li>
        <li><p align="left">A user edited and written weekly
            magazine, and an online international weekly magazine
            and a poetry center for users' publications </p>
        </li>
        <li><p align="left">Diverse program functionality ranging
            from online games like chess, to activism modules,
            faxing capability, calendars, polling,
            teleconferencing, etc., audio and video functions,
            point and click ease of use, an online school with
            extensive course offerings, children's offerings, and
            so on. </p>
        </li>
        <li><p align="left">Extensive Internet and Web guidance </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">LOL is like having your own private America
    On Line, shared with a community of comparably committed and
    politically aware users, all linked to many other progressive
    socially responsible systems, and to the whole internet. It
    is a telecommunications home where one can learn, interact,
    react, and create within a mutually supportive community. And
    it is also a base for forays outward with the best editorial
    advice and guidance around.</p>
    <p>These functions are all accessible within your main
    browser windows, or via plug in modules that download
    automatically and install in your computer, like this Windows
    Chess module.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Left Bulletin Board System, or Left On Line (or LOL)
    aims to become a continuous town meeting of large sectors of
    the progressive community providing useful information,
    facilitating exchange of ideas, hosting conferences,
    developing new political program and unity, facilitating on
    line activism, and acclimating progressive people to new
    technologies. </p>
    <h2 align="center">[<a
    href="http://www.lol.shareworld.com/leftonl/lolentry.htm">Visit
    and, if you like it, Join LOL</a>]</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
    <p>LOL is a system within the <a
    href="http://www.shareworld.com"><font size="3"><strong>ShareWorld</strong></font></a><font
    size="2"><strong> </strong></font>community of online
    systems. Shareworld creates custom designed systems for
    diverse progressive organizations such as The Wilderness
    Society (WOL), The Nation Magazine (NOL), and many others.
    ShareWorld maintains and operates the technology, handles tech
    support, etc. for all these systems, including Left On Line.
    The online content of LOL itself, however, is directly
    maintained by its sysop, <a href="../zmag/fralbert.htm">Michael
    Albert</a> of Z Magazine.</p>
    <p>Each of the systems in ShareWorld has its own interface,
    design, and special features. All of them share many of their
    content offerings among the whole community of ShareWorld
    systems, however.</p>
    <p>We would give you some screen shots to look at here, but
    it is easier for you just to go to our visitors site and look
    for yourself. If you are not a member you have only limited
    access from the visitors site, though you can join directly
    via your computer link up.</p>
    <h2 align="center">[<a
    href="http://www.lol.shareworld.com/leftonl/lolentry.htm">Visit
    and, if you like it, Join LOL</a>]</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Finances</h2>
    <p>Revenues to LOL derive from fees paid by users (find out
    how to <a href="frsubscrib.htm">subscribe to LOL</a>): </p>
    <ul>
        <li>there are monthly fees for all typical functions </li>
        <li>there are special fees (only) for taking an online
            course or buying a book or other product</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Incoming fees pay for maintaining the system and
    continually upgrading it, for getting content for the system,
    for maintaining internet connectivity sufficient to usage
    levels, for technical support, etc. Also, a considerable
    portion of LOL fees go to funding left projects and
    institutions of diverse types and range. </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><em><strong>Z</strong></em> is an independent
            political magazine of critical thinking on political, cultural, social, and
            economic life in the United States. It sees the
            racial, sexual, political, and class dimensions of
            personal life as fundamental to understanding and improving
            contemporary circumstances and it aims to assist
            activist efforts to attain a better future. </p>
            <p>To these ends, <em><strong>Z</strong></em>
            attempts to operate in a democratic fashion, both internally and also with
            respect to its contributing writers and artists and
            the broader national progressive community. </p>
            <p><em><strong>Z</strong></em> accepts no paid
            advertising. Our product is the magazine, not readers
            in turn sold to advertisers.</p>

        <h2>Editorial Policies and Author Relations</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em><strong>Z</strong></em>'s monthly contents are
            an amalgam of pieces pre-contracted with regular writers and artists
            as well as freelance submissions chosen at the time
            of publication. </p>
            <p>The choice of articles is guided by our purposes
            and the desire to have original material, rather than merely
            duplicating coverage available in other venues. </p>
            <p><em><strong>Z</strong></em>'s author relations are
            rooted in the idea that writers know what they want
            to say and should not have to give up control of the
            way they want to say it. Our regular writers have almost
            unlimited control over their own space in the magazine,
            and we also avoid at all costs editing the ideas of freelance pieces,
            though we often do have to edit freelance submissions
            for style and length. </p>

    <p>The exact match is called budgeting. In practice, of
    course, many of the numbers will vary from this prediction.
    One disconcerting variation will arise from ongoing large
    increases in postal rates and paper costs. In any event, when
    costs rise, or some revenue declines, the resulting gap must
    be eliminated by increases in another revenue item--generally
    either donations or ancillary sales. We have no room to push
    costs further down. </p>

<h2>ShareWorld Forums</h2>
<p>One of the most important features of any ShareWorld on line system is its forum facility. This allows users to engage in on-going 
discussions with one another, and sometimes with experts in a field. It promotes exchange of ideas and vision, but it also allows 
people to explore new ideas and develop shared agendas. </p>
<p>Each ShareWorld system has its own set of forums created by its membership and sponsoring organization. Some of these will be 
private to the one system's direct users, or even to just the staff of the sponsoring organization, in some cases. But many will also 
be made public to the whole community of ShareWorld systems. Thus, on each system, you can access forums created within your 
system, in all other ShareWorld systems, and UseNet Groups from the broader world of the internet.</p>
<p>Here, then, are some of the relevant windows from the Forum Facility. First, the message center window, also used for E-Mail, 
here shown with some message headers from a particular forum:</p>
<p><img src="images/SWforu4.gif" align=bottom width=636 height=392></p>
<p>Here are a couple of windows used to set your preferences for forums to track for offline reading and writing:</p>
<p><img src="images/SWforu5.gif" align=bottom width=521 height=270></p>
<p><img src="images/SWforu6.gif" align=bottom width=590 height=350></p>
<p>Writing and reading messages is analogous to what one does in E-Mail and includes formating, spell checking, file cabinets, etc. 
There is also a nice Web Related feature. If there is a web site address in a message, in a forum or in E-Mail, it shows up 
underlined and functions as a link. Click it, and your browser goes to the indicated site. Here is a window for reading messages...</p>

<h2>ShareWorld Rates</h2>
<p>So what does it costs an end user to benefit from a ShareWorld System? Well, there are two ways to join 
any ShareWorld based system such as Nation On Line, Wilderness On Line, Left On Line, and so on.</p>
<p>One can become a Basic Member, or one can become a Sustaining Member.</p>
<p>A Basic Member pays $10 a month. Basic Members can telnet into or make long distance calls into their 
on line system for unlimited hours for the one fee. They can also call local numbers we provide 
throughout the country to connect. For this type connection, however, their membership only entitles them 
to two free hours per month. After that they must pay the hourly rate for use (currently $1.50 soon to drop, 
ultimately to $1 an hour).</p>
<p>Sustaining Members can also long distance call or telnet into their ShareWorld System for unlimited 
hours for their monthly payment. For local calls, however, they get 8 free hours each month before they 
must begin to pay the hourly rate. However, in some parts of the country where we are able to establish 
speciall connection sites, Sustaining Members can call local access numbers and get online for unlimited 
hours each month for their single monthly fee.</p>
<p>Beyond connection the only additional costs on ShareWorld systems is for things you self consciously buy 
while online. These may include books you purchase, or magazine subscriptions, or fees for a course you 
take, etc. But there are No Hidden Fees at all no matter what you do.</p>
<h2><img src="images/div.gif" alt="[HRule Image]" align=bottom width=465 height=7> </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>ShareWorld Finances</h2>
<p>ShareWorld's costs are many and varied, as with any complex undertaking. The main components are 
maintain the hardware and developing the software for each new system, maintain and paying for phone 
links, developing content, moderating and handling system usage, legal, accounting, and other such 
matters, payroll, etc. </p>
<p>All income to ShareWorld is from the basic monthly fees and small add-ons to costs of courses, items 
bought on line, etc. When a user goes over the alloted two free hours a month of local call access (for a 
basic member) or eight free hours of local call access (for a sustaining member) the fees they pay beyond 
their monthly rate just cover the costs of providing them the extra local access. </p>
<p>Out of incoming monthly payments, on each ShareWorld System $2 per month per person goes back to the 
sponsoring organization for them to utilize in their own operations, however they see fit. sponsoring 
organizations also get revenues when people take courses they initiate, or buy products they put online, 
etc. As a result, ShareWorld Systems provide very substantial financial assistance to diverse progressive 
organizations, one of the most important things about our effort..</p>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>Marble arose from innovative energies at the </font></font><a href="index.htm" target="_top"><font color="#000000"><font size=3>ZNet</font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size=3> website, the </font></font><a href="SWindex.htm"><font color="#000000"><font size=3>ShareWorld</font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size=3> 
online Project, and the folks responsible for </font></font><a href="index.htm" target="_top"><font color="#000000"><font size=3>Z Magazine</font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size=3>. Indeed, we hope 
interest in </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> will stimulate interest in these other projects. </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3><img src="images/marble-x.jpg" align=bottom width=53 height=60>Why the name </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>?</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>No good reason at all. When the idea for this project first surfaced we did a lot 
of mental contrasting to Slate, the Microsoft magazine project. We thought why 
not trump the name. Thus...</font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3><img src="images/marble-green-smaller.jpg" align=bottom width=64 height=60>Why a fee to get </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>? </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>This issue of </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>, as you know, is free. And </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> will remain free for 
many weeks into the future. But in 1997 it will cost money to access </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>. It 
may be $15 a year, or $10 a year -- we don't know yet since we are only now 
learning costs and how many folks will be interested. But why charge at all, 
many will ask? And this is an important question.</font></font></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>Within the economic world we inhabit, the world of private ownership and 
markets, the world called capitalism, everything economic has bills paid by 
someone. What bills are there to pay with a web site? Well, there are connection 
charges, there is equipment, and there is a the considerable time and work 
associated with maintaining the sites, with updating the content, and, in cases like 
</font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>, with creating the content.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>When you traverse web sites that charge nothing it may be that the sponsor is 
shouldering all the costs or that they are shouldering technical costs and writers 
and artists are shouldering the costs for creating content). Or it could be that the 
unsightly and obnoxious ads you try to avoid are paying the bill. We don't have 
either of these options. Neither we nor our writers and artists have the 
independent resources to finance </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> without generating revenues from its 
readers. And we neither could nor would want to have </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> ad-driven. </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3><img src="images/marble-whiteish.jpg" align=bottom width=53 height=60>Why no ads? </font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>First, few businesses would want to advertize at a site like </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3>. But far more 
important, we do not want to be in the business of selling you, our readers, to 
Microsoft or IBM or Volvo, or whoever else. That is what being ad-driven 
means. The product becomes the person accessing the site and the consumer 
whose agenda constrains content becomes the advertiser. The reader of an 
ad-driven site needs to be in the mood to buy, not in a critical and self-conscious 
mood, much less aroused to political and social awareness. The implications for 
content of being ad-driven are contrary to our purpose.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>So, we have to get funds from you, the folks who use the site, directly. Let's be 
clear here. You pay, one way or the other. Either you react positively to ads, buy 
products advertised, and then a part of that expenditure comes back to the web 
site from the advertiser, in the ad-driven case theat we reject--or you pay 
directly to the web site itself, for what it offers you, in the content driven case 
that we have adopted.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3><img src="images/marble-shield.jpg" align=bottom width=53 height=60>How much will we charge?</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>Let's not mince words about this. We are not going to figure out the absolute 
minimum amount we can possibly charge. </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> is a progressive political 
project. Its reason for being is to contribute to social change. It is capable, we 
hope, of generating revenues. Many progressive projects are not able to do that. 
So, </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> becomes a way to generate funds not only for itself, but for work that 
its writers and authors do and support, and for work the sponsoring staff 
supports, such as the many projects you will find described at the </font></font><a href="index.htm"><font color="#000000"><font size=3>ZNet</font></font></a><font color="#000000"><font size=3> site. 
Thus, we will charge a rate that seems commensurate to the interest folks have, to 
the costs we have, and to the needs that projects we support have.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>As our finances become clear, we will publish details in this section of the 
magazine.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=3>For now, however, enjoy the mag...and please, let us know your suggestions as 
you develop views about what </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> should offer, how it should operate, and 
so on. You can do that by EMail, or even better in the public forum about </font></font><font color="#0000FF"><font size=3><strong>Marble</strong></font></font><font color="#000000"><font size=3> 
Policy, each indicated in the Table of Contents offerings.</font></font></p>

<p>The following is most (but not all) Z articles and files (and a few other offerings) that can be found within 
this site, listed by author. It is not, however, everything in the ZNet site. Many offerings in the Chomsky 
Archive, for example, are not referenced here, as they are on a different server or did not appear in Z. 
Also, letters to the editor from each issue of Z do not appear here, though they are on the site and do 
appear in table of contents listings by issue or year. Also, some other files from the ZNet site that will 
eventually appear here have yet to be excavated into this list...</p>
<p>Please note also, though this list will eventually include a large portion of published articles from Z, it 
will be far from complete. a rough estimate of the total of all published articles to date would be 
approximately 1,400. Last, in the list of Chomsky articles below, some appear with footnotes, unlike their 
published versions.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to access articles, files, etc. within the ZNet site. You can also use the toc frame 
to the left to select a month or year and see issues for that time period, or you can user our <a href="../search.htm"><font size=2><strong>Search Files</strong></font></a><font size=2><strong> 
</strong></font>facility to see all files that match a specification you enter.</p>
<p>Here, however, you can look by author.</p>

<h1>Economic Vision: Course Outline</h1>

<address>
    Faculty: Michael Albert
</address>

<hr>

<h2>A. Getting Started</h2>

<p>The idea of this course is a bit unusual. We are not only
trying to develop our understanding of particular existing
economic visions, which would be fine all by itself. We also want
to develop an ability to think about and create economic vision,
more or less from scratch, on our own.</p>

<p>Here is the tentative outline of lecture topics. They may
change somewhat in light of interests, the pace the course
actually goes at, etc. (Notice, the outline doesn't give away too
much of the plot...)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction: What is an economy and what aims might we
        have for an economy </li>
    <li>Existing Visionary Options (market, centrally planned,
        social democratic, anarchist&lt;193&gt;)</li>
    <li>Production 1: Conceptualizing general aims for workplaces
        and work</li>
    <li>Consumption 1: Conceptualizing general aims for
        consumption</li>
    <li>Allocation 1: Conceptualizing general aims for allocation</li>
    <li>Production 2: Defining workplace decision making
        structure, workplace job roles and work</li>
    <li>Consumption 2: Conceiving desirable remuneration and
        consumption decision making</li>
    <li>Allocation 2: Defining criteria of decision making,
        motivations, information issues, choice issues,
        allocation institutions and roles</li>
    <li>Economic Aims in context of society as a whole</li>
    <li>Thinking about Transition/Program/Strategy</li>

<h2>B. What is this course's purpose?</h2>

<p>As some of you likely know, I &quot;thought up&quot; (with
Robin Hahnel) the vision called Participatory Economics. Part of
the aim of the course is to understand it, and also the visions
called &quot;market socialism,&quot; and centrally planned
socialism.&quot; But what I am also hoping is that we will
develop an ability to judge these systems and even to think up
adaptations or entirely different models. </p>

<p>Therefore the aim of the course is to learn how to conceive of
an economic vision, to learn about a few (and one in particular),
and to develop an ability to judge economies and economic
visions. </p>

<blockquote>
<h3>LOLU Registration Terms</h3>
<p>LOLU semesters begin February 1, June 1, and October 1, and run for 10 weeks. Numerous courses 
are given each semester and any LBBS member can register to take or audit any number of LOLU 
courses. </p>
<p>Courses are of two types: seminar and lecture. In the former there are generally weekly readings, 
followed by discussions led by the faculty person in charge. In the lecture courses there may be 
readings, but there will be weekly lectures, with subsequent discussion, question and answer, etc. 
Some courses include writing assignment, some do not. </p>
<p>It is possible to audit a course ($30) or to take a course ($75). In the former case you can only read 
all the available material. In the latter case, you can also participate, asking questions, writing 
comments, engaging in discussion, doing writing assignments, etc., online. </p>
<h3>College Credit for a LOLU Courses</h3>
<p>LOLU courses are very serious endeavors often superceding (should you choose the option of full 
participation and involvement) in information and time commitment many university courses. </p>
<p>However, LOLU courses do not automatically carry university credit. Whether we could arrange 
some sort of link with some school to provide this or not is unclear, but that it would increase the 
cost of the classes manyfold (due to the fee we would have to pay the university) is a fact. Typical 
online university level college credit courses are in the $1,500-$2,500 price range. </p>
<p>We have felt, therefore, that it made more sense for students wanting credits to sign up for a reading 
course or independent study with some empathetic faculty person who was willing to have LOLU 
course participation as the course content. This way, we keep our fees down, and students who really 
want credits for the involvement can find it. </p>
<h3>To register for a LOLU Course</h3>
<p>To take a LOLU course you must be a member of LBBS. Once you are, you can register for a LOLU 
course by Email, or, if you prefer, by slow mail. The course catalog is always available online, and 
registration requires only sending a message with relevant credit card information and course 
designations included. </p>

<blockquote>
    <h1 align="center"><font color="#0000FF">Introduction </font></h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&quot;Thinking Forward&quot; is a compendium of lectures
    from a course on Conceptualizing Economic Vision given on the
    Left On Line telecommunications system. The procedures for
    the course are typical for online courses. Each week there is
    new lecture. During the week, students react and pose
    questions. Faculty responds, as do other students. Debate
    proceeds and there is another lecture at week's end. This
    volume, then, is one among many that we hope will emerge from
    the Ideas on Line University. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Outline &amp; Purpose</h2>
    <p>The online course has ten &#147;lectures,&#148; in turn
    used as the basis for this &quot;online book,&quot; to which
    we also add an Introduction and Conclusion. The course lectures
    are: </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Scene Setting</b>: What is an economy; what aims
            might we have for an economy? </li>
        <li><b>Existing Visionary Options</b>: Market, centrally
            planned, social democratic, and green decentralist
            options. </li>
        <li><b>Production 1</b>: General aims for workplaces and
            work. </li>
        <li><b>Consumption 1</b>: General aims for consumption. </li>
        <li><b>Allocation 1</b>: General aims for allocation. </li>
        <li><b>Production 2</b>: Workplace decision making, job
            roles, and work. </li>
        <li><b>Consumption 2</b>: Remuneration and consumption
            decision making. </li>
        <li><b>Allocation 2</b>: Criteria of decision making,
            motivations, information, and choice, &amp;
            allocation institutions and roles. </li>
        <li><b>Evaluating Economic Visions &amp; Contextualizing Economic
            Aims: </b>Judging economies against our values and fitting
            an economy in society. </li>
        <li><b>Reactions to Parecon and Responses </b>What have
            critics said about Parecon, and what responses have
            the authors offered. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The lectures have three primary ends. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, one aim of the course is to understand the
            visionary economic model called Participatory Economics
            that my frequent co-author Robin Hahnel and I have
            presented in other volumes (<i>Looking Forward</i>,
            South End Press, 1991, and<i> The Political Economy
            of Participatory Economics</i>, Princeton Univ.
            Press, 1991), as well as the other contending visions
            called &#147;market socialism,&#148; and
            &#147;centrally planned socialism.&#148; </li>
        <li>Second, the course also teaches how to judge these
            systems and to adapt them or conceive entirely
            different economic models. </li>
        <li>Finally, most ambitiously, I hope many of the how-to
            think about social vision lessons of the course apply
            to other domains, for example conceptualizing gender,
            political, or cultural aims for modern societies. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Why Vision?</h2>
    <p>For some people the question &#147;why vision?&#148; may
    appear silly. It is like taking a trip, they might reason. We
    need vision to know where we are going. How else can we
    organize our journey so it points in the right direction and so nothing
    about it diverts us from our destination? Vision tells us where
    we want to arrive and reveals how our present locale falls
    short of our desires. Vision raises hope and desire. It
    motivates and secures our efforts against temporary setbacks. </p>
    <p>These are reasonable reactions, yet others have serious
    doubts about pursuing vision. &#147;You can't know the future sufficiently
    to formulate vision sensibly,&#148; they argue. &#147;To act
    as if you can is deceitful,&#148; they warn. And anyhow, &#147;even if
    you could pose a sensible vision, it would be authoritarian
    to do so,&#148; they conclude. &#147;The future must come
    from everyone's involvement and for a few people to pose a
    vision crowds out that involvement. If you start thinking about
    vision, rather than collectively creating it, a few people
    will impose a future of their private design rather than hosts
    of people collectively creating the future.&#148; </p>
    <p>The points are well taken, yet this defender of pursuing
    vision is not convinced. Can a critic of trying to develop economic
    or other social visions really contest that to move forward
    wisely, we must know something about what we want to wind up?
    How do we even formulate our present choices without knowing
    our future aims? Surely social change strategies can't only respond
    to what is, but must also aim for what we want. History shows
    that well motivated movements against contemporary ills often
    failed even after defeating opponents because &#147;in victory&#148;
    they established new structures little better than the old
    ones&#151;in part, no doubt, for want of having anything
    better clearly in mind. And can anyone really contest that to
    have compelling aims can help sustain struggle? </p>
    <p>The critic, undaunted, replies that these are powerful
    arguments for vision, yes, but that they do not tell us how much
    and how detailed a vision we need, only that something is
    needed. And then, coming at it from the opposite direction,
    the critic of pursuing vision asks: Can anyone who advocates developing vision
    deny that history and society are horribly complex, so that the
    future is largely beyond our predictive abilities? Can any visionary contest that
    to make believe one can predict future arrangements and
    structures in detail is outrageous hubris? And can any
    advocate of developing a compelling vision deny that this can
    lead to an egotistical attachment to one conception, removing experiment,
    participation, and learning, and cramming history into an
    inflexible mapping that may have little or nothing to do with real
    human potentials? Surely this too has happened in history. </p>
    <p>Yes, of course, responds the reasonable advocate of conceptualizing
    vision, these correctives of the &#147;anti-visionary&#148; are
    very important, but they don't tell us that we ought to have
    no vision, they merely limit how much we ought to try to
    conceive and warn us about how we ought to use any vision we propose. </p>
    <p>Well, this debate could rage much longer, but we must make
    a choice. So what do we take from the contending viewpoints
    for our book, <i>Conceptualizing Economic Vision</i>? In
    light of the good points raised on both sides, how do we approach
    the question of vision generally and of economic vision specifically?
    How much do we want? What attitude do we need to take toward
    what we adopt? </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>We seek a picture of a desired future rich and detailed
        enough to provide hope and direction but to also respect
        careful analysis based on real knowledge. We understand our
        efforts to be cumulative, adaptable, and always the basis
        for more clarification, refinement, and improvement as we
        learn more through practice. We are not creating blueprints
        to confine ourselves, but outlines that anyone can
        utilize, adapt, refine, and replace as we proceed.</i> </p>
        <p><i>More, we see that widespread participation in designing
        a better future requires that people become adept at
        thinking about institutions, structures, social roles,
        and how these relate to desirable values. Therefore to
        have a blueprint which guides and constrains a movement
        and which is determined by a few and overseen by them is certainly
        authoritarian. But to openly propose a vision, and to try
        to disseminate the skills and knowledge needed for
        effectively conceptualizing and adapting vision is the opposite.
        It respects that people need and will use vision both for
        direction and for sustenance, but simultaneously enlists
        and assists people in joining a collective, flexible, continually
        improving, visionary project of their own making.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The most effective opponents of too much vision might
    still say, simply, that &#147;what we need is to reduce
    hierarchy and injustice to an absolute minimum.&#148; As we
    band into social movements to reduce hierarchy and injustice,
    we will learn more about how to accomplish the end as much as
    possible. To try to postulate anything more in the way of
    future vision now &#147;will narrow our view on the one hand, and
    likely be ill-conceived due to the complexity of the issues
    involved, on the other.&#148; </p>
    <p>Our reply, finally, is that the critic of certain ills
    that derive from pursuing vision too vigorously or too
    inflexibly cannot have it both ways. If the world is so
    complex, and the possibility for error in choosing paths
    through it is so great, which is all too true, then as with
    any other human endeavor, some care and thought is in order.
    And if there is no public effort at creating vision, if public
    tools and methods are not evolved, then a relatively few folks with great
    intellectual confidence will take these tasks upon themselves
    privately. Such folks will be, by their training and their
    position in society, those who are conceptually well equipped
    to come up with ideas about new institutions and especially
    to voice them convincingly, but who are also socially horribly equipped
    for doing this humanely, due to their elitist, academic
    biases. In other words, by arguing against the need to publicly address issues
    of vision in sufficient detail, the critics of vision
    ironically foster exactly the ends they wish to avoid: vision created
    by a self-defined elite, imposed on the many who are excluded
    from conceptualizing vision, and reflecting a narrow set of elite
    interests due to the authors' places in society. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>To us, the real solution to the conundrum&#151;that people
        seeking a better society need vision but that having
        vision can also do us harm&#151;is not to reject vision
        in public while it is developed privately, but to debate
        visionary aims and goals publicly, and, more, to
        disseminate and clarify the methods by which vision is developed
        and refined so that all people who wish to do so may partake
        of the project, confidently bringing to bear their own insights, interests,
        and experiences.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As to whether this approach can avoid the hubris of
    proposing too much, or the elitism of trying to limit those
    who participate in conceiving vision, or the sectarianism of
    trying to constrain future thought to narrow channels, the reader
    and history will have to judge. But my unabashed aims in <i>Conceptualizing
    Economic Vision</i> are to develop clarity about values,
    methods of analysis, and to elaborate concepts suited to
    describing and evaluating the defining institutions of a
    desirable economy. And to me this includes conceiving how
    production could be organized, the character of consumption,
    and what means of allocation would be employed, all
    sufficiently for assessment and refinement by others, and for
    adaptation and use as a guide in developing programs for change. Anything
    less is candy for the mind, but has very limited bearing on
    attaining a better world. </p>
    <p>To begin to accomplish these ends as a preliminary step we
    have to know: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is an economy&#151;so we know what we have to
            describe in order to have described an economic
            vision </li>
        <li>What aims do we want an economy (i.e. our economic vision)
            to accomplish&#151;so we know what qualities we have to
            build into the economy we favor. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>But before getting to these introductory issues, which are
    the main focus of our first lecture, there is one further matter
    to discuss. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Reading Conceptualizing Economic Vision Productively.</h2>
    <p>In these lectures I try to be conversational and clear,
    but not simplistic. We start from scratch, assuming no prior knowledge
    of economics or social change struggle. This is not a
    textbook in the traditional sense, nor a history book, nor a
    survey of a field, nor a comprehensive carefully honed rendition of
    my own views on economic vision. It is, instead, very nearly
    an exact transcription of the lectures from an online course
    whose content was very much determined by its participants.
    It seeks to teach, to provoke, to elicit, not to create or to
    present. </p>
    <p>As a means to this priority aim, each lecture only takes
    us part way to where I want readers to be by the time of the
    next lecture. That is, in each lecture I ask a number of
    questions. Settling on answers before turning to the next lecture where
    my answers appear, and even writing them out if you have the time
    (as online students do in message posts that I and others
    react to), will greatly increase the value of reading this
    book. Yes, of course you can just read <i>Conceptualizing
    Economic Vision </i>without trying to answer the questions yourself<i>.</i>.
    But experience with this course in the Left on Line
    University suggests that trying to puzzle out the many issues
    raised before reading my take on them will be far more
    instructive, particularly regarding the &#147;how to conceptualize vision part&#148;
    of what this book is about, rather than just the &#147;here are
    some visionary ideas and views&#148; part. </p>

<h1>Consumerism: Lecture 3</h1>

<h2>More on &quot;Keeping up with the Joneses.&quot;</h2>

<address>
    Faculty: Juliet Schor
</address>

<hr>

<p>This week, I thought I would discuss the major work on
&quot;keeping up with the Joneses,&quot; or status competition to
have come out in the last two decades, namely Robert Frank's
CHOOSING THE RIGHT POND (New York: Oxford University Press,
1985). Frank is an interesting and eclectic economist from
Cornell University, who argues that the phenomenon of
status-seeking is is pervasive in our society, that economists
have largely ignored it, and that the attempts to gain status can
explain much of the way labor markets, consumer markets, and
other aspects of the economy operate. I don't endorse his
criticisms of the left particularly, but I think this book has a
lot to say. The title Choosing the Right Pond refers to the fact
that people can choose to be little fish in big ponds or big fish
in little ponds, and that their attitdues about status will
inform those choices. What follows is a summary of Frank's
arguments:</p>

<p>1. The importance of relative position and relative income.
Duesenberry (and others we talked about last week) argue that
what matters to people is not just their absolute level of
income, but their relative income. This conclusion is supported
by some classic evidence, cited in most discussions on relative
income. First, Frank notes that surveys of happiness show that
rising absolute levels of income are not associated with rising
absolute incomes. (I also discuss this evidence in chapter 5 of
my book, The Overworked American.) For example, in the United
States, there is no rise in happiness over the period 1946-1970,
a period when average incomes rose dramatically. (For those
sceptical of opinion measures, self-reported happiness scores are
correlated with &quot;objective&quot; measures of people's
well-being.) Second, Frank refers to the classic evidence of
Richard Easterlin, who found that happiness does rise with
income, at any given time. That is, within any country, at a
given time, higher income people are happier, and lower income
people less happy. This will hold true as their average income
rises as well. And he found that across countries, the
relationship does not hold. People in poor countries are as happy
(on average) as those in rich countries. (This evidence has
changed in recent years, perhaps because a more globalized world
has made those in poor countries more aware of where they stand
relative to rich country dwellers. Television, movies,
international travel and migration may have been responsible for
this change.) Another piece of evidence is that the amount of
money Americans report is necessary to live decently rises almost
in parallel fashion with average incomes. Our expectations and
&quot;needs&quot; are not determined so much by absolute levels,
as by social norms. These norms are the basis of social
comparisons. </p>

<p>2. Is status seeking a biological imperative? Frank starts
with a BIOLOGICAL model, in which he argues that evidence from
animal studies, as well as some human studies, indicate that the
quest for status is an innate characteristic of human beings. He
cites studies in which humans' heart rate and pulse are measured
in social situations. These find that people tend to have a
higher heart rate and faster pulse when they are in social
situations with people of a higher social status. He also looks
at monkey studies show dominant monkeys have higher levels of
serotonin. (So do officers of college fraternities and leaders of
athletic teams!) Third, he argues that humans display a herd
instinct, in which we follow each other in status contests. He
also provides anecdotal evidence about children's behavior,
arguing that by the time we reach adulthood we have been taught
to repress many of our natural desires for status (we are taught
that those feelings are shameful and anti-social.) In the
children's example, he performs an experiemnt on his children,
giving them different levels of organe juice each day. He finds
that they don't mind getting less juice when both of them receive
less. It's when there's a disparity in what he pours out to them
that the trouble starts. </p>

<p>Is status-seeking biological? My answer at this point is that
we don't really know. I am generally sceptical of biological
explanations for social phenomenon. I don't think we know much
about &quot;human nature&quot; at all. Among both animals and
humans the range of social interaction is so wide that it's hard
to draw a link to biology. The animal studies Frank cites are
hardly compelling, because it's almost always possible to find
animal studies showing opposite kinds of behavior. Where I do
agree with Frank is that the drive for social status seems to be
very pervasive in our own society. And I think that's what really
matters at this point.</p>

<p>3. Who are we in competition with? For most of us, it's not
Donald Trump, the Rockefellers, or the folks on Dynasty. It's
people in our own circles. Our neighbors, co-workers, relatives,
friends, etc. Most people choose their frames of comparison
realistically, focussing on people near us in the hierarchy. We
know the Rockefellers are out of reach. The buying patterns of
the people next door will have more of an impact on us. Objects
of comparison (or what are called reference groups) are also
multiple. That is, we won't just compare ourselves to ONE set of
people. If we interact with a number of types of people, we will
have overlapping and varied reference groups. For example,
employees tend to have strong reference group identification with
co-workers, but also with neighbors. (I will provide some survey
evidence on this in a later lecture.) The media MAY also be
important here. One argument is that popular
culture/media/advertising, by exposing us all to a common
lifestyle, can create a national reference group that large
numbers of people relate to. And if Hollywood and television show
lifestyles are above the level most people can afford (as they
are), exposure to media can generate dissatisfaction, desires to
emulate, and aspirations which are beyond people's capability to
achieve. (If this sounds like it is counter to what I argued last
week, I don't think it is. My argument is not that the media is
irrelevant, but that it operates within, or on top of, this
underlying context of social emulation/status competition.)</p>

<p>4. What do we compete about: the crucial role of visibility in
social competitions. As we begin to think about the dynamics of
status competition, it becomes clear that not all goods or
activities can serve equally well in status competitions. In
particular, those things we are competing over need to be
somewhat &quot;socially visible.&quot; Why? If they are not,
who's to know we have them, and how can the desire to emulate be
transmitted? To a certain extent, there is a credibility problem
here. If I am trying to gain social status, I can brag about
having particular things (like a fat bank account, or a safe
deposit box full of valuables), but I may not be telling the
truth. Why will others believe me? If the goods we compete about
are visible, there's no need to advertise what we have. It is
evident and obvious. Visibility also deals with another problem
associated with status. If you try too hard to get it, you can't.
Striving for status can backfire, as the nouveau riche often
painfully find out. Sorting out the credibility and legitimacy of
status claims is a key part of the game. For example, in
eighteenth century England, when an emerging bourgeoisie was
attempting to rise socially, the aristocrats and landed gentry
developed a social system based on &quot;patina&quot; to
de-legitimize the claims of these nouveau riche. What was patina?
It was the inevitable signs of age that goods achieve as they are
passed from generation to generation. Anthropologist Grant
McCracken in his book, CULTURE AND CONSUMPTION (Bloomington:
Indiana University Press, 1990, ch 2 on patina) argues that the
patina system was the dominant system of social organization
until sometime in the eighteenth century. At the height of the
patina system, pretenders would try and counterfeit status by
acquiring used goods, or by trying to make new ones look good.
(Hence the use of family crests, etc., which make it impossible
to use another family's possession to acquire status for
yourself.) It is easy to see how, in a society of fashion and
mass consumption, the patina system cannot survive. Status began
to be associated with novelty. Today, and since the 18th century,
only the rich still practice a status system based on patina. </p>

<p>But to return to social visibility. Patina was one system
based on socially visible goods and their characteristics. We may
have abandoned patina, but socially visible goods are still the
lynchpin of social competitions. What are they? Cars, houses,
furniture and clothes are the most obvious examples of modern
status symbols. If we think carefully about patterns of buying,
we can see how visibility plays a role. Take furniture. Where is
the fanciest furniture in the house? The most public (and
ironically least used room), the living room. Which will be the
least well-decorated? The bedrooms (most private). (Where will
people hang curtains last, or not at all? Bedrooms.) What about
clothes? The prestige of the &quot;brand&quot; people wear rises
as we move from undergarments to coats and overcoats? It is my
contention that in a whole range of products, the evidence will
show that the prices paid, and the status of brand names bought
will rise with the level of &quot;social visibility&quot; of the
product. </p>

<p>In a recent paper I have written with a former student, Angela
Chao, entitled &quot;Empirical Tests of Status Consumption:
Evidence from Women's Cosmetics&quot; we test just this idea. We
have gathered both quality and price data on four cosmetics
products: lipsticks, mascara, eyeshadow, and facial cleansers.
These four have significantly different levels of social
visibility. Lipsticks are taken out in public (at dinner tables,
in meetings, etc.) Eyeshadows and mascaras are semi-public, seen
more in women's &quot;powder rooms&quot; but sometimes in full
view. And facial cleansers are only used in the privacy of
women's own homes. We hypothesize two things. First, that the
relationship between price and quality will be weaker the more
socially visible the product. And second, that we will find more
&quot;high-end&quot; or high- priced buying among the visible
products. Both these hypotheses turned out to be strongly
supported by our evidence. With lipsticks, the most visible good,
there is NO relationship between price and quality. In fact, all
lipsticks (within type, ie., matte, shiny, etc.) are made of
identical ingredients and in blind &quot;taste-tests&quot;
consumers cannot tell the difference between cheap and expensive
lipsticks. In fact, in one extreme example, consumers could not
differentiate between Flame Glow (a low- status brand selling at
$18.83 an ounce) and Chanel (perhaps the most prestige name of
all, selling at $181,24 an ounce). When the lipsicks were in
generic containers, just as many women preferred Flame Glow as
chose Chanel. Why then are women paying $25 for a Chanel lipstick
when they can get an identical product for $2? Our answer: the
social status associated with Chanel, and the social embarassment
of pulling out the $2 brand. By contrast, women do demand
somewhat more quality in their choice of facial cleansers, where
it turns out that more expensive brands are ranked more highly in
terms of quality.</p>

<p>We also found strong differences in how women buy, based on
social visibility. There is much more &quot;high end&quot; buying
in lipsticks than facial cleansers, and an intermediate amount in
the eyeshadows and mascaras, exactly as we predicted. We also
found differences in the extent to which different types of women
seek status. Women with more education and more income do more
status buying. Women in cities and suburbs, and white women are
also more status-conscious. These are exactly the patterns we
expected.</p>

<p>We think that if we replicated this kind of study for other
products (clothes, houses, cars, furniture, etc.) we would find
similar patterns. Up to this point, however, we have not been
able to find the kinds of data we need to do so.</p>

<p>5. Status goods as &quot;signals&quot; and the need to keep
up. This point relates to the interesting comments made by Holly
Pence in response to last week's lecture. As she argued, there
are strong pressures for individuals to &quot;keep up&quot; in
the status game. If you are looking for a job, or trying to
succeed in one, bucking the standard marks of status can be
interpreted as a &quot;signal&quot; that you are failing. (i.e.,
clothes below the standard, a beat-up car in a management
environment, etc.) In interviews I have done with women who have
&quot;downshifted&quot; (ie., are dropping down or out of the rat
race), the expenses of maintaining a professional wardrobe
continually comes up. These women may not necessarily enjoy
shopping or spending their money on clothes, but they feel it is
necessary to appear to be successful and competent. Similarly,
for people whose jobs involve impressing clients, the appearance
of success is important (a nice office, a good car, expensive
clothes). If you look too shabby, your ability will be
questioned. Why? Because spending is a signal of income which is
taken to be indicative of ability. As long as the society
operates with a status system (as all do, in one way or another),
the pressures on individuals to conform are strong. And our
particular system is one which focusses on SOCIALLY VISIBLE
CONSUMER GOODS.</p>

<p>6. Prisoners' dilemmas and inadequate incentives for
non-visible goods. Once the competition is oriented to socially
visible goods, it becomes obvious that socially invisible goods
will be underproduced and underdemanded. Important examples are
public goods, occupational health and safety, savings, and
leisure, none of which focus as status symbols, and all of which
are in inadequate supply in our economy today. Why? Think of a
two person competition, between Smith and Jones. Let's say
they're competing about visible consumer goods and what matters
is their relative positions. In a 12 hour day, they could each
work 8 hours a day with 4 hours leisure, or 12 hours a day with
no leisure. If they both work 12, they will both have the same
income, (and hence be equally socially), but no leisure. This is
the worst outcome for both. Smith could work 8 hours a day, but
if Jones works 12, he or she will be behind socially (because
Smith's income will be lower). The converse is also true. The
best outcome for both would be an 8 hour day, with 4 hours of
leisure and an equal position for each. The prisoner's dilemma (a
solution to a standard game theory problem) is that by
cooperating they could get to the best outcome (the 8 hour day).
But because we have a non-cooperative, decentralized, market
system, they cannot cooperate. They will both be forced to work
as hard as they can in order to compete. The outcome will be the
12 hour day for both. They're both worse off, but without
cooperation neither trusts that the other will stay at 8. (and
neither will). [The name prisoner's dilemma comes from the famous
example of two prisoners who both confess, (the uncooperative
solution), and both go to jail, rather than both keep silent (the
cooperative solution) and go free. Each fears the other is
confessing, and so is driven to confess him or herself. This is
what happens in our example. Both Jones and Smith fear the other
will work longer hours, and thereby get ahead in the
competition.]</p>

<p>This example shows one reason why we don't have enough leisure
in our society, why people don't save enough, or why the pressure
to reduce taxes for public consumption goods is so strong. We are
so heavily oriented toward STATUS COMPETITION IN PRIVATE, VISIBLE
GOODS. There are lots of reasons to think this competition got
worse in the 1980s. And that various social restraints on such
competition are weakening. And once again, this is an example of
how advertising and the media can have an effect--through their
exacerbation of this competition. </p>

<p>7. Final point: The need for a centralized, cooperative
intervention. The prisoner's dilemma problem (the failure to
achieve a better, cooperative solution) shows why we need
government intervention in the market to steer us from too much
destructive status competition. As Robert Frank argues, this is
the rationale behind having uniforms in high schools (to reduce
clothes competition). Or one rationale for a consumption tax, or
incentives for saving. (A savings account is a socially invisible
thing. People can brag about how much they've got, but it's not
all that credible.) We are in a situation now much like the ball
game where one by one people start standing up to get a better
view. The first few people benefit. But eventually, everyone sees
only as well as they did when sitting, and their legs are all
tired. They need an announcer to get on the loudspeaker and tell
them all to sit back down. </p>

<p>It looks to me like we have gotten onto a faster and faster
consumer treadmill, working longer hours and depriving ourselves
of savings, public goods, and a healthy environment, in order to
keep this competition going. It's high time somebody told us all
to sit down and relax. The question is, how do we get people to
listen?</p>

<p>NOTE: I enjoyed your comments last week. Next week I will
present some evidence from the survey I have just conducted on
these issues. Have a nice holiday tomorrow. By the way, on our
last one day holiday--Veterans Day--I noticed the whole world was
shopping. In fact, near a new designer clothing outlet here, the
police had to close down the off ramp from the Interstate,
because the traffic to get to the mall was blocking up the whole
highway. How's that for American consumerism! </p>

        <p>Participatory Economics is the name of a type of
        economy proposed as a desirable alternative to
        contemporary capitalism. The &quot;authors&quot; of this
        model, or vision, are Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel.
        the underlying values the economic vision seeks to
        implement are:</p>
        <dl>
            <dd><img src="images/ideadot.gif" width="20"
                height="20"> equity</dd>
            <dd><img src="images/ideadot.gif" width="20"
                height="20"> solidarity</dd>
            <dd><img src="images/ideadot.gif" width="20"
                height="20"> diversity</dd>
            <dd><img src="images/ideadot.gif" width="20"
                height="20"> participatory self management.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The online Participatory Economics Project is an
        effort to use telecommunications to refine and otherwise
        improve the parecon model, to disseminate information
        about it and build support for it, and to stimulate
        activism around the parecon vision and provide support
        for people trying to implement components of parecon now
        or to win changes in existing structures consistent with
        trying to implement parecon in the future.</p>
        <p>The various facets of the online Parecon project are
        mostly in an early conceptual stage, with much more work
        to be done. However, one author, also an editor of <em>Z
        Magazine</em>, Michael Albert, taught an online course on
        &quot;Developing Economic Vision,&quot; in the online
        school available through Left On Line. The purpose of the
        course was to collectively go through the process of
        conceptualizing an economic vision. The aim was to
        develop skills and concepts suitable to the task and
        adaptable, as well, to the task of conceptualizing vision
        for other aspects of social life. </p>
        <p>Albert posted a new lecture designed to provoke and
        sustain creative student participation each week for ten
        weeks. Each lecture contained many questions which
        students in the class discussed during the ensuing week,
        with Albert contributing, answering questions, etc. Then
        there would be a new lecture, including succinct answers
        to the many questions asked the prior week. </p>
        <p>While the lectures and discussions were aimed at
        developing skills and broad general principles, they also
        evolved a fairly comprehensive picture of the
        Participatory Economic vision.</p>
        <p>For now, the only thing we have to offer in the online
        Parecon Project is these lectures (though not the weekly
        discussion). They are included here as links to lectures
        1 - 10..</p>

<h1 align=center>Welcome to the Web!</h1>
<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The Web is simply a large number of pages of text 
and graphics that are linked together with <b>hyperlinks</b>. Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) 
indicate that an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link: <a href="http://www.lbbs.org/">ZNet</a>). And many graphic elements 
(if your browser displays them) are also links. Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow 
you to follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers, like Lynx, let you follow links 
using your keyboard. Don't worry about clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the 
Web. </p>
<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some links to starting points for learning more 
about browsing. Whenever you click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come back here 
by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option on your browser. </p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>
<p align=center>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in mind that you want to find and use a 
search engine to look for related sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting 
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new links, and so on. Here we give you a start 
with both these approaches by indicating: </p>

<p>ZMI offers courses in politics, media studies, computer
skills, and project skills, has project work groups, and evening
speakers. Here is a listing of some of our course offerings. Each
year the selection changes somewhat, but the total of courses
offered is usually around 75. The numbers indicate multi-level
courses such as Gender 1, Gender 2, and Gender 3, etc. Each
course runs for an hour and a half. Each day has four course
periods, though one of these is often given over to project group
meetings, and a special hour slot for student run courses,
special sessions, etc. Student run sessions are scheduled as we
proceed through the sessions. The list below changes somewhat,
yearly, depending on who is going to be available, etc.</p>

<h1 align=center>Welcome to the Web!</h1>
<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The Web is simply a large number of pages of text and graphics that are 
linked together with <b>hyperlinks</b>. Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that an element of text is a 
hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link: <a href="http://www.lbbs.org/">ZNet</a>). And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links. Graphical 
browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based 
browsers, like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause 
any harm to the Web. </p>
<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever 
you click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come back here by using the back up a page option or the Return 
to Home option on your browser. </p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.eit.com/web/www.guide/"><b>A Guide to Cyberspace</b></a> </li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to create your own web pages or create your own site, you need to understand a little about the underlying language of Web 
design. Here are some good places to begin:</p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>
<p align=center>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for 
related sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting links and following those that strike your fancy, 
then continuing to new links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by indicating: </p>

<H1>Welcome to the Web!</H1>
</CENTER>

<p>The Wilderness Society has its own web site, <a
href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/">WildernessNet</a>,
and its own interactive online telecommunications system called <a
href="http://www.wol.shareworld.com/"">Wilderness
On Line</a>. We hope you will regularly visit the former, and join the
latter. (Just click the names to check out the sites.) Here, however, we
would like to provide some general instructions on using the Web and some guides
to worthy Web destinations.

<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The
Web is simply a
large number of pages of text and graphics that are linked together with
<b>hyperlinks</b>.
Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that
an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link:
<a href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/"">WildernessNet</a>).
And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links.
Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to
follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers,
like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about
clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the
Web.

<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some
links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever you
click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come
back here by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option
on your browser.

<p>If you want to create your own web pages or create your own site, you
need to understand a little about the underlying language of Web design.
Here are some good places to begin:</p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>

<p>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in
mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for related
sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new
links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by

<H1>Welcome to the Web!</H1>
</CENTER>

<p>The Wilderness Society has its own web site, <a
href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/">WildernessNet</a>,
and its own interactive online telecommunications system called <a
href="http://www.wol.shareworld.com/"">Wilderness
On Line</a>. We hope you will regularly visit the former, and join the
latter. (Just click the names to check out the sites.) Here, however, we
would like to provide some general instructions on using the Web and some guides
to worthy Web destinations.

<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The
Web is simply a
large number of pages of text and graphics that are linked together with
<b>hyperlinks</b>.
Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that
an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link:
<a href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/"">WildernessNet</a>).
And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links.
Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to
follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers,
like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about
clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the
Web.

<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some
links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever you
click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come
back here by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option
on your browser.

need to understand a little about the underlying language of Web design.
Here are some good places to begin:</p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>

<p>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in
mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for related
sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new
links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by

<h1>Political Economy: Lecture 3</h1>

<h2>Different Economic Visions</h2>

<address>
    Faculty: Robin Hahnel
</address>

<hr>

<p>The simplest way to organize economic activities is for every
person to produce everything she wants to consume and consume
everything she produces. That is, for every person to be totally
self-sufficient. This is the &quot;autarkic&quot; solution to the
economic problem and has never been used because (1) human beings
are a social species and have never been inclined to &quot;go it
alone&quot; except under extreme and temporary conditions of
geographical isolation, and (2) this solution is very inefficient
compared to solutions where people specialize in some production
task(s) and &quot;trade&quot; with others who specialize in other
tasks, since greater &quot;division of labor&quot; can permit
greater overall productivity.</p>

<p>Every other solution to the economic problem involves
organizing and coordinating the interdependent activities of
people. This is always done via major economic institutions that
combine into some particular kind of &quot;economic system&quot;
that governs production, consumption, and allocation.</p>

<p>Every economic system must decide:</p>

<p>(1) What to produce (and what not to produce.)</p>

<p>(2) How much of each kind of good or service to produce.</p>

<p>(3) How to produced each good or service, since there is
usually more than one way to produce things.</p>

<p>(4) Who will consume what goods and services.</p>

<p>(5) How to distribute the burdens and benefits of this
&quot;social&quot; economic activity among the members of the
economy.</p>

<p>What distinguishes one kind of economic system from another is
how each of these decisions gets made. What combination of
institutional promotion and conscious human decision making are
brought to bear on these decisions? Which people, or groups of
people make which decisions under what kinds of institutional
constraints? Different economic systems answer these questions
differently. And as I argued in the second part of the first
week's lecture, what makes one economic system better or worse
than another is whether one makes these decisions more equitably
and efficiently, with a greater degree of self-management,
promoting a greater degree of solidarity and variety, than
another. But what are the major possible economic systems?
Feudalism is a system where peasants manage themselves farming
parcels of land to which they have &quot;use right&quot; by
inheritance. But in exchange for their use right they must give
part of their harvest to the Lord of the manor. They might also
have to work for free on lands belonging to the Lord of the manor
under their own, or his supervision. The Lord receives his part
of the peasants' produce, and keeps what the peasants produce on
his land supposedly in exchange for protecting the peasants from
conquest by another Lord. But this is very much like store owners
paying protection money to the local mafia who protect them
from... you guessed it, retaliation at the hands of the local
mafia should the store owners refuse or forget to pay protection
money. With hindsight, few find the system very complex. His
monopoly of military power permits the Lord to exact tribute in
the form of goods and labor services from those who reside within
his fiefdom. Military power allows the Lord to take part of what
the peasants produce, and consume a great deal more than they
without working himself at all.</p>

<p>While it is tempting to agree with Marx that the basis and
nature of feudal exploitation is transparent -- as compared to
the nature and basis of capitalist exploitation -- presumably it
did not appear so to many of feudalism's denizens. One suspects
that few Lords saw peasants as other than lazy, cowardly, low
life that didn't deserve the protection he afforded them. And
many mixtures of tradition and religion in different parts of the
world have combined to weave complicated ideological webs of
rationalization and acceptance on the part of peasants who failed
to see the distribution of burdens and benefits of feudalism as
anything other than natural, fair, and beyond question.</p>

<p>Markets for goods are not integral to feudalism. [Granted, in
real world feudalism goods were traded between different regions
by merchants and artisans selling to Lords and well-to-do
peasants. But this activity was peripheral to the feudal system
-- and eventually proved to be a cancer that contributed to the
demise of feudalism and birth of capitalism.] Nor is there a
market for labor in feudalism. Peasants are not free to sell
their services for a wage. The are precisely unfree to work for
anyone, anywhere, because they must work on the land to which
they have inherited user rights and their Lord's lands. Peasants
work under their own direction both on their family plots and
usually on the lands of the Lord as well, so they are not
&quot;alienated.&quot; The Lord does not &quot;oppress&quot; his
peasants in the sense that he controls and directs how they work,
but only in the sense that they are his inherited captives who
must render goods and services unto him according to traditions
and regulations that the Lord interprets. And while borrowing and
lending occurred in real world feudalism, a credit market is not
integral to feudalism either. Lords would go into debt to wealthy
merchants who operated outside the feudal system to finance
consumption and military binges. But peasants did not borrow to
be able to produce, and pay back principal and interest out of
the production thereby made possible.</p>

<p>In sum, there is exploitation in feudalism, but neither
alienation nor oppression as we defined them in the previous
lecture. There are two classes since peasants work and Lords do
not, though Lords consume far better than peasants. To all of us
who can recognize the existence of &quot;feudal
exploitation,&quot; the burdens and benefits of economic
cooperation are distributed unfairly in feudalism with the Lords
receiving the lion's share of the benefits and the peasants
shouldering most of the burdens. Nor would one expect feudalism
to be particularly efficient. There is little division of labor
to provide greater productivity. And there is limited incentive
for either Lord or peasant to improve productive techniques since
either would have to share a major part of the gains from any
improvement with the other.</p>

<p>Capitalism is an economic system guided by two major economic
institutions: (1) Private ownership of productive assets wherein
those who own those assets hire others to work for them under
their direction for an agreed wage [otherwise known as
&quot;private enterprise.&quot; And (2) markets where anyone can
buy and sell any kind of good or service on terms that are
mutually acceptable to buyer and seller [otherwise know as
&quot;free markets&quot; or a &quot;market economy.&quot; So a
short hand way of describing a capitalist economy is as a Private
Enterprise Market Economy, or PrEME.</p>

<p>In capitalism there are employers who hire employees to work
under their direction with tools and machinery and land the
employers own or have rented. And there are employees who agree
to work under an employer's direction in return for a wage.
Nobody consumes what they produce herself, but instead buy what
they want to consume in goods markets paying with whatever
&quot;income&quot; they may have. Employees, or workers get
income from wages. Employers, or capitalists get income from
profits -- the difference between the revenues they get from
selling the goods their employees make and the costs they incur
hiring employees and whatever equipment and materials the
employees need to work with. </p>

<p>Since workers work and capitalists don't, though capitalists
consume far better than workers, there is exploitation in
capitalism. But just as few feudal Lords recognized feudal
exploitation, we should not be surprised if few capitalists
recognize capitalist exploitation. Instead most capitalists see
workers as lazy and unable to engage in productive activity if
not for the equipment [capital] and organizational efforts
[entrepreneurship] extended by capitalists. And most capitalists
see workers' wages as more than they deserve, and their own
profits as meager compensation for the critical role they play.
More surprisingly many workers fail to see &quot;capitalist
exploitation&quot; and accept the view that since their labor
contract is voluntary and mutually beneficial there is no
exploitation. It is also not only capitalists who see profits as
legitimate compensation for an important service -- making
available the equipment and inputs necessary for production and
organizing complex production processes. But for all of us who
can recognize &quot;capitalist exploitation,&quot; the burdens
and benefits of economic cooperation are distributed unfairly in
capitalism with capitalists receiving the lion's share of the
benefits and workers shouldering most of the burdens. The basis
for capitalist exploitation is not a monopoly of military power
but a monopoly of the means necessary for production that make it
possible for capitalists to pay workers less than required to
purchase all the workers produced, thereby leaving capitalists
with profit income with which to purchase part of what their
employees made without having to work themselves. There is also
alienation and oppression as we have defined them in capitalism
since capitalists get to decide how workers laboring capacities
will be utilized.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, these are the only two classes capitalism
&quot;must&quot; have. But &quot;pure capitalism&quot; seldom
exists in reality. Since real economies evolve in particular
historical patterns, there are usually remnants of previous
economic systems within emergent systems, and at some point
aspects of future economic systems begin to develop within
present systems. One form these remnants and precursors take is
classes that played important roles in previous systems or could
play important roles in future systems. So during different eras
classes other than capitalists and workers have played important
roles in real world capitalist economies. It is also terribly
important to remember that the organization of the economic
sphere of social life is not the only important defining feature
of human societies. How the political, kinship, and community
spheres are organized, how the dynamics in other spheres of
social life affect and are affected by the dynamics in the
economic sphere combine with economic dynamics to determine how a
society operates. And besides classes defined by the dynamics of
capitalism (in conjunction with classes from previous and future
economic formations,) groups defined by the social relations in
other spheres -- especially community, gender, and politically
defined groups that are privileged or oppressed by the
organization of non-economic activities and therefore have
conflicting interests in social change or stability -- interact
along with whatever classes emerge from the functioning of the
economy. These are important lessons that derive from a
complementary holist, as opposed to an &quot;economistic&quot;
perspective. </p>

<p>But even when looking at real world capitalist economies,
classes other than capitalists and workers have played important
roles. In early European capitalism landlords were an important
third class, and along with capitalists and workers were the
object of scrutiny by economists like Adam Smith and David
Ricardo in particular. Landlords, or course, were the previously
dominant class in European feudalism and remained a potent force
in the European economies as capitalism developed there.
Landlords also play important roles in many third world economies
today. This is not the time or place to discuss how the
introduction of capitalism into third world societies by foreign
companies and governments leads to class and community struggles
that are a great deal more complicated than the class dynamics of
some pure, abstract capitalist model. Suffice it to say that the
500 year evolution of modern day imperialism has left most third
world economies with a much more complex combination of classes
and community groups that struggle over social stability and
change in those societies.</p>

<p>In his own analysis of 19th century European capitalism, Marx
focused no little attention on a class he called the &quot;petite
bourgeoisie&quot; of self-employed sellers of goods and services
whose origins were in precapitalist market dynamics, and who Marx
expected to &quot;wither away&quot; with capitalist development.
But elements from this class transformed into part of a class
that has come to play an increasingly important role in modern,
corporate capitalism. Where owners of large corporations are
stockholders divorced from managing the production process, and
where mediation of the conflicts between capitalist and workers
both inside and outside the work place has taken on greater
importance, what Mike Albert and I call the coordinator class,
and Barbara and John Ehrenreich call the professional managerial
class, play an important role in the space &quot;between labor
and capital.&quot; [Hence the title of Pat Walker's edited book
of essays that discuss how to understand and evaluate the
behavior of this class in modern capitalism.] Moreover, I will
argue that it is impossible to understand what occurred in the
&quot;post-capitalist&quot; economies of the 20th century, or
evaluate different post-capitalist visions, without understanding
the coordinator class and its potential to become the ruling
class in particular kinds of post-capitalist economies. But what
&quot;post-capitalist&quot; alternatives exist?</p>

<p>Public Enterprise, Centrally Planned Economies or PuECPEs: In
this economic system control over human-made and natural
productive assets is in &quot;public&quot; rather than
&quot;private&quot; hands and the allocation of resources and
goods is determined by a plan. There is no private ownership of
land, resources, and factories giving decision making authority
over their use to individuals; instead authority over the use of
&quot;society's productive resources&quot; is determined by the
procedures of &quot;central planning.&quot;</p>

<p>In central planning the relative social values of different
final goods and services is determined by a political process
(that may be dictatorial or democratic) which are then
communicated to a Central Planning Board. The CPB is directed to
maximize the value of economic activity in light of the resource
availabilities and productive capabilities of the economy. The
CPB collects information on: the availability of land, resources,
and labor with different skills and training, the technical
capabilities of different production facilities' abilities to
combine inputs to produce outputs, and proceeds to calculates a
&quot;plan&quot; that maximizes the social value of production
given resource and technological constraints. How this all can be
done, what different options are available, and the political,
social, human, and economic consequences of how it is done, we
will explore theoretically and historically when we look at the
collapse of communism in week seven. For now, suffice it to say
that economies CAN be run according to a central plan that
determines what to produce, how much to produce, how to produce
it, and how to distribute it. In one sense, the planning system
consists of communicating society's economic priorities to
planners who determine how best to achieve those goals with
society's limited productive resources. In another sense the
planning system consists of a small group of planners in the CPB
and managers in the publicly owned enterprises deciding what and
how to produce things, telling workers where and how to work, and
telling consumers what they will have to consume. While central
planning is essentially a non-market system for making economic
decisions, we will see that markets CAN appear within central
planning to accomplish particular tasks. The important thing when
this occurs is to remember that while markets may be used to
distribute goods to consumers once they are produced, markets do
not determine how much of different goods will be produced in
centrally planned economies. Similarly, while labor markets may
be used to assign particular workers to particular enterprises,
labor markets do not determine how many workers of each kind will
work in different plants, and do not determine wage rates. How
much to of what to produce and how many workers of different
skills will work where for how much is all determined by the plan
even when markets exist in central planning.</p>

<p>Many supporters of public enterprise, centrally planned
economies saw it as a classless economy. Everyone would be
worker/consumers on an equal footing. The nightmare of private
appropriation of scarce social resources along with the inequity,
alienation, and inefficiency this brought would be replaced by a
rational use of productive resources to best achieve society's
economic goals. In this view central planners and managers were
merely to be knowledgeable servants of the workers and consumers,
translating their desires about consumption and work preferences
into the most efficient assignment of productive capabilities. In
reality this is not what occurred in the Soviet Union, Eastern
Europe, China, Cuba -- or any place the system has been deployed.
Instead classes emerged in all centrally planned economies --
even the least corrupt. And I will argue this is predictable, and
not merely the result of non-democratic political influences or
betrayals on the part of foolish or corrupt leaders. Instead of a
capitalist ruling class, centrally planned economies are ruled by
a coordinator class of planners and managers who end up
oppressing and exploiting workers and consumers. The idea that
the coordinators are working for the workers and consumers is a
doublespeak myth. Instead it is workers who labor at the behest
of the coordinator class who consume more than ordinary workers,
work under more pleasant conditions than ordinary workers, and
make all important economic decisions. Ordinary workers are
alienated from decision making and have inferior work lives and
consumption opportunities. This is not to say that all workers
are equally exploited or alienated in centrally planned systems.
And it is important to recognize there are other oppressor and
oppressed groups that emerge from the kind of political,
community, and kinship systems that have accompanied experiments
in central planning. But even in at its best, public enterprise
centrally planned economies would be plagued by classes,
exploitation, oppression and alienation. They cannot be classless
utopias.</p>

<p>Public Enterprise Market Economies or PuEMEs: PuEMEs combine
public ownership with allocation of goods and services through
markets. We will consider different variations on this theme in
the eighth and ninth week of the course when we focus on current
debates over desirable alternatives to capitalism. But the most
important difference between different &quot;models&quot; of
PuEMEs is how the managers of the public enterprises are
selected. In the early 1950s the Communist Party of Yugoslavia
broke with tradition and replaced its system of central planning
with a system they called &quot;workers' self-managed market
socialism.&quot; They not only dismantled their planning
bureaucracy telling public enterprises to buy whatever inputs
they needed in the market place and sell their output in markets;
they gave employees considerable influence over hiring their own
enterprise managers. A number of political economists have
elaborated theoretical models based on this idea that I call
Public Enterprise, Employee Managed, Market Economies, PuEEMMEs.
The other major category of PuEME is one where a state agency
appoints managers of the publicly owned enterprises and monitors
their performance. A system along these lines was used in the
Soviet Union during the 1920s during what was known as the New
Economic Policy, or NEP. Oscar Lange, Abba Lerner, and Frederick
Taylor analyzed a theoretical version of the model in the 1930s.
The model became the &quot;reform model&quot; critics of the
PuECPE model proposed in the Post World War II era in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union. And to the extent that
&quot;Perestroika&quot; -- literally economic restructuring --
had specific content in the Gorbachev era, the idea was to
transform to a Public Enterprise, State Managed, Market Economy,
PuESMME.</p>

<p>We will discover there are important differences between
PuESMMEs and PuEEMMEs. But I will argue that while the former is
much worse than the latter, both variants of Public Enterprise
Market Economies are inevitably plagued by exploitation, class
divisions, and alienation. In these economies the capitalist
class will also be replaced by a coordinator class who will
dominate economic decision making and exploit ordinary
worker/consumers. The systems will be driven by market enforced
competition that promotes self-serving, anti- social behavior
rather than bureaucratic intimidation and patronage that is the
motor force of centrally planned economies, and the dynamics and
tendencies of market based coordinator economies will differ
substantially from centrally planned coordinator economies. But
exploitation will certainly exist since public enterprise market
economies necessarily reward participants according to Maxim 2:
to each according to the value of his or her personal
contribution, which means those with greater human capital will
work in more desirable settings and enjoy better consumption
opportunities than those with less human capital. And a class of
managers, technocrats, bankers, and mutual fund managers --
depending on the model in question -- will exert an influence
over economic decisions greatly in excess of the degree to which
they are affected by the decisions leaving most workers and
consumers alienated from the most important decisions affecting
their economic lives.</p>

<p>Public Enterprise Economies with Participatory Planning, or
PuEPPEs: Pat Devine of the University of Manchester in England
has provided a detailed description of a system of democratic
planning he calls negotiated coordination. Mike Albert and I have
presented a model we call participatory economics, or
&quot;parecon&quot; for those familiar with LBBS forums. In both
systems enterprises are publicly owned and market allocation is
replaced by a system of democratic, or participatory planning. As
in the case of different versions of PuEMEs there are important
differences between these models, but both claim to remain true
to the goals of those who have insisted that a positive
alternative to market driven systems is both possible and highly
desirable.</p>

<p>In a participatory economy enterprises are publicly owned and
managed by workers councils where not only do all members have
equal voting rights but job &quot;complexes&quot; are balanced
for both desirability and empowerment. Consumption opportunities
are based on effort, or personal sacrifice, and consumption is
organized by neighborhood consumers councils and federations. And
workers and consumers manage their interconnected activities
through a participatory planning procedure where each workers and
consumers council proposes and revises what its own activity will
be in light of increasingly accurate information about the
consequences for others.</p>

<p>There have been no &quot;real world&quot; examples of stable
participatory economies we can study and evaluate. For brief
periods revolutionary groups of workers and activists have
engaged in experiments that shed some light on what we might
expect. In the earliest years of the Russian Revolution, before
the Civil War and Bolshevik dictatorship crushed them, factory
committees and soviets attempted to coordinate their economic
activities through negotiation and planning based on solidarity
rather than through markets or central planning. In parts of
Northern Italy in the early 1920s, in Anarchist regions of Spain
during the Spanish Civil War, and during the uprising in Hungary
in 1956 economic activities were organized for brief periods of
time on the many of the same principals as those that define
participatory economics. And there is much in current Zapatista
thinking and practice in Mexico that is consistent with the ideas
behind participatory economics. But historical experience is very
limited and incomplete. In any case, we will spend weeks eight
and nine discussing the debate that has revolved around
participatory planning versus market based alternatives to
capitalism over the past four years. But if its advocates are
right, participatory economics goes farther to eliminate
exploitation, oppression, alienation, and class divisions than
any of the other economic systems we know of, and improves
efficiency as well. Critics, on the other hand, have argued that
there would be significant efficiency losses as well as
unacceptable losses of personal liberties or freedoms in such
economies, and that a transition to such an economy from a modern
capitalist system is inconceivable. You of course, will read and
participate in the debate, and make up your own minds. </p>

<h1>Economic Vision: Lecture 1</h1>

<address>
    Introduction: What is an economy and what aims might we have
    for an economy
</address>

<address>
    Faculty: Michael Albert
</address>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>A. Getting Started</h2>

<p>The idea of this course is a bit unusual. We are not only
trying to develop our understanding of particular existing
economic visions, which would be fine all by itself. We also want
to develop an ability to think about and create economic vision,
more or less from scratch, on our own.</p>

<p>Here is the tentative outline of lecture topics. They may
change somewhat in light of interests, the pace the course
actually goes at, etc. (Notice, the outline doesn't give away too
much of the plot...)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Introduction: What is an economy and what aims might we
        have for an economy </li>
    <li>Existing Visionary Options (market, centrally planned,
        social democratic, anarchist...)</li>
    <li>Production 1: Conceptualizing general aims for workplaces
        and work</li>
    <li>Consumption 1: Conceptualizing general aims for
        consumption</li>
    <li>Allocation 1: Conceptualizing general aims for allocation</li>
    <li>Production 2: Defining workplace decision making
        structure, job roles and work</li>
    <li>Consumption 2: Conceiving desirable remuneration and
        consumption decision making</li>
    <li>Allocation 2: Defining criteria of decision making,
        motivations, information issues, choice issues,/
        allocation institutions and roles</li>
    <li>Economic Aims in context of society as a whole</li>
    <li>Thinking about Transition/Program/Strategy</li>
</ul>

<h2>B. What is this course's purpose?</h2>

<p>As some of you likely know, I thought up (with Robin Hahnel)
the vision called Participatory Economics. Part of the aim of the
course is to understand it, and also the visions called
&quot;market socialism,&quot; and centrally planned
socialism.&quot; But what I am also hoping is that we will
develop an ability to judge these systems and even to think up
adaptations or entirely different models. </p>

<p>Therefore the aim of the course is to learn how to conceive of
an economic vision, to learn about a few (and one in particular),
and to develop an ability to judge economies and economic
visions. </p>

<h2>C. The Mechanics of the Course</h2>

<p>To even begin to accomplish these ends as a first, preliminary
step, we have to know (a) what is an economy, (b) what aims do we
want an economy (our economic vision) to accomplish.</p>

<p>Knowing (a) what an economy is tells us what we have to
describe and explain in order to have described and explained an
economic vision. Knowing (b) what aims we have for economic life
and activity tells us what characteristics and qualities we have
to build into the economy we favor.</p>

<p>Before getting to these introductory issues, however--and they
are the main focus of this first lecture and do set a foundation
for much that follows--let's do a little introducing--and
scene-setting.</p>

<p>Each week I will post a lecture. I am going to try to be
conversational and clear, but not simplistic. Each lecture will
take us part way to where I want the class to be by the time of
the next lecture, but not all the way. Getting the rest of the
way is going to require some work on everyone's part during the
subsequent week. After all, you can't learn new ways of thinking
and evaluating without some practice. To facilitate
participation, in each lecture I will ask a bunch of questions.
Settling on answers will get us where we need to be for the
subsequent lecture. </p>

<p>During the week following each lecture I hope many of you will
react to what I have offered, ask questions about whatever you
find confusing, suggest improvements to anything you think is
inadequate, raise related issues that interest you, and also, as
a priority, try to provide answers to the questions I raise
preparatory to delivering the next lecture. (The best way to do
that, by the way, is to compose your answer after reading the
lecture, but independently of other people's answers. The more
independent answers we get to questions, up to a point, the
better.) In any event, answers to the questions I ask are going
to be needed in order to proceed with the next lecture.</p>

<p>Sometimes questions I raise will have many viable answers.
Other times, there may be one right answer. During each week I
will try to relate to everyone's comments and questions and I
will certainly relate to answers to the questions I offer in the
lectures, prodding until we get what we need to continue the next
week.</p>

<p>You can send me EMail if you would like to communicate in
private. And I may send a message or two privately as well. The
fact is, I have no more experience teaching a class this way than
any (most?) of you have taking one this way. We are going to
learn the limits and assets of this approach together. The main
thing, I think, is when you have a question ask it, when you
disagree about something put your different view forward, and
let's all remember this is a learning experience, not a shoot-out
at the OK Corral. There actually aren't going to be all that many
of us--probably about twenty or so, so it ought to be quite
manageable.</p>

<p>As one &quot;assignment&quot; for this first week, finally,
could each student write a brief personal message, briefly
describing yourself and your prior knowledge or lack of knowledge
in the field, indicating your reasons for taking this course. A
little background about each student will be good, I think, to
help us interact and also to help me prepare lectures.</p>

<h2>(I) What is an Economy?</h2>

<p>How the hell do we answer a question like this? I suppose we
could go look it up somewhere, but the idea in this course is to
create our own answers, not to go find and repeat someone elses.</p>

<p>So, how about if we take it a step at a time. What happens in
an economy? </p>

<p>Well, people consume and produce things. So let's start with
that: an economy is the set of institutions that facilitate and
organize people producing and consuming things. </p>

<p>What then is production, what is consumption, what is an
institution, and what does &quot;facilitate and organize&quot;
mean?</p>

<h3>Production:</h3>

<p>Well, regarding production, when it happens something new
generally emerges. And, it doesn't emerge from nothing, but from
stuff that is combined together in the act of production. So we
have inputs to production and outputs from it. The inputs are
combined, the outputs are the result. The action undertaked in
the middle, is called work. The places where this happens we will
call workplaces. </p>

<p>Okay, so what are the inputs and what are the outputs of
typical production processes?</p>

<p>This is the first question that we need to answer to be ready
for lecture two. (I'll get you started. Answer for an auto plant.
One thing that goes in is rubber. One that comes out is a Honda.
But there is much more...) But let's do it &quot;in class&quot;
during the week. For now, let's just go on as if we already had
the answer. You might want to think about it, before
continuing...and I hope many of you will answer it, in your own
way, in messages, before you read other people's posts, as part
of your first reaction this coming week.</p>

<p>Next, knowing what the inputs and outputs of production are,
how do we describe workplaces? They are institutions you might
say. Fine. But what is that? What is the critical attribute that
defines institutions, and that distinguishes one from another? </p>

<p>Is it the floorplan? Is it the size of the building, or even
the existence of a building? Is it the speed things happen at?
The quality of the results? These characteristics are important,
but not at the heart of the matter, I think we can agree. Then
what?</p>

<p>Well, we know that there is something similar that is
profoundly important, about, say, GM, Microsoft, and the local
cannery. This is what we want to get a grip on. And it isn't
their size, their products, their buildings, their locales. They
have almost nothing in common on these axes. What they share is
instead something about the relations that exist, day in and day
out, among the actors who get together in these institutions.
Something about their motivations, interests, behaviours, and
choices. This is what we really mean, it seems to me, when we
refer to an institution.</p>

<p>So how about if we say that an institution is a collection of
social roles (plus some infrastructure and perhaps equipment, and
the people who fill the roles). By social roles we mean things
like union steward, mother, judge, manager, CEO, owner, worker.
Then, the critical things that is similar about the businesses
mentioned above, all of which are capitalist, is that they all
embody the same basic defining role structures. In different
economies it follows that we will have qualitatively different
types of economic institutions due to their having qualitatively
different role structures.</p>

<p>So, in any economy, we have workplaces which have role
structures and in which production takes place. There are inputs
and outputs. If we are going to define an economic vision, part
of the job will be defining these production institutions, and
particularly their role structures.</p>

<p>What are the primary roles within capitalist workplaces? </p>

<p>Is a public school a workplace, a GM factory, a family? Why or
why not?</p>

<h3>Consumption:</h3>

<p>Now we have something to go with. One important part of the
art of doing theoretical work, of understanding some domain or
envisioning one, is to develop concepts and then build on them,
only adding new ones when they are really needed. We have defined
one type of economic activity, production. We have said it has
inputs and outputs (which we will describe this week) and we have
said that it is carried out in production institutions, which we
call workplaces, and that these have role structures (that we
will also address during the week in our messages) that are what
give them their defining features.</p>

<p>So what about consumption? Well, we immediately know that it
is another economic activity. It too has inputs and outputs. It
too is carried out in context of institutions, and we can call
them consumption institutions. And they too have role structures.</p>

<p>And now we have some more questions we need to deal with
during this coming week:</p>

<p>What are the inputs and outputs of consumption activity? </p>

<p>What distinguishes consumption activity from production
activity? </p>

<p>What are some consumption activity roles?</p>

<p>Is a factory, a school, a family a consumption institution?
Why or why not? </p>

<h3>Allocation:</h3>

<p>Now we return to the sticky question of facilitating and
organizing the economic activities production and consumption.
What does this entail?</p>

<p>Well, we know that there are a whole lot of people consuming
and producing, and we know that there are a whole lot of places
where all this activity goes on. Allocation is the name we give
for the institutions by which and through which it is determined
what the inputs and outputs of the economy's activities will be
and where they will wind up.</p>

<p>In each production institution, what is produced, how much,
with what steps, by whom? For each person and group of people,
what is consumed, how much, and how is it gotten? How does what
is produced come to match what is sought for consumption and vice
versa. How do outputs match up with inputs?</p>

<p>The market is an allocation institution. And so is a central
planning apparatus. And we might dream up some others as well,
including say, decentralizing the economy into little separate
self-sufficient units so that allocation is carried on entirely
as a face-to-face exchange.</p>

<p>Once we think of markets as an institution we know that we
need to describe the associated role structure. Likewise if we
think of central planning this way, again, we have to describe
the roles that are associated with central planning. For markets
we have buyers and sellers. There may be other refinements in a
particular market economy, but we could go a long way toward
figuring out the defining features of markets if we revealed the
motivations and behaviors of these buyers and sellers and how
their behaviors combine to influence allocation. For central
planning we have order givers (planners) and order takers
(workers)...</p>

<p>And, likewise, for any economic vision we will need to do the
same thing, describe the allocation institution in terms of the
roles that it defines for economic actors and the ensuing
dynamics and processes and their implications for who does what,
who gets what, etc.</p>

<p>What is investment and what does it have to do with
allocation?</p>

<p>In a market economy, what determines how much of the product
each actor gets?</p>

<p>And what determines, in a market economy, how much work each
actor does? </p>

<p>So to define an economy we need to define production,
consumption, and allocation institutions that work successfully
together. That will be our goal. But, of course, not just any
such institutions. We want ones that have qualities we like.</p>

<h2>(II) Evaluating an Economy, and our Aims</h2>

<p>Economies affect people. This is pretty obvious, but important
to understand in a bit more detail. They influence what we do (by
providing roles we have to fill) and what we get from the
productive output (by allocations outcomes). These two facts in
turn have much to do with our possible life stories. Are we doing
interesting or boring things at work? Do we have power over our
circumstances or are we bossed around by others? Do we starve,
get by, or enjoy luxury. What happens to our personalities and
potentials in the work we do and consuming we opt for? And so on.</p>

<p>Evaluating an economy means asking how do its institutions
affect people? What are the built-in implications for people's
lives of the economy's production, consumption, and allocation
institutions/roles when they are operating as they are meant to?
If the economy propels anti-social attitudes or distorts and
underutilizes human capabilities, or if it rewards people
unjustly, these would be issues to take up in evaluating it. To
make a judgment we must have some values, some norms for what is
good and what is bad in economic life. </p>

<p>And the issue isn't so much some specific economic event,
perhaps a mistake, say, or the act of a psychopath, but the
built-in dynamics of the economy and their inevitable
implications for people's lives. So what would we like an economy
to achieve in the way of broad general aims?</p>

<p>There are many possible answers.</p>

<p>We might want an economy to simply maximize output for our
society. The economy that can yield the biggest pile of produced
stuff is the one we want, regardless of other effects. We might
want an economy which ensures that some set of people get the
most possible stuff, regardless of the overall amount produced or
what anyone else gets. We might want an economy which yields
identical outcomes for everyone in the society, regardless of
output, or with the largest output consistent with that degree of
equality. And so on.</p>

<p>I am going to propose some broad goals: equity, solidarity,
diversity, participatory self management, plus efficiency, and,
by implication, classlessness.</p>

<p>We could argue about these, I suppose, forever. And maybe we
should have some of that in our interactions. My reasons for
choosing these as the economic aims I want to see embodied in an
economy probably stem from all manner of things--you cannot
arrive at values purely by reason. But, I think among leftists
they should be pretty uncontroversial, save insofar as we might
wonder if a system can address them all simultaneously.</p>

<p>Thus, equity says we should have fair or just outcomes. No one
should get more of a good thing, or of a bad thing, than he or
she deserves. We will talk more about what determines how much
one deserves later&lt;193&gt;</p>

<p>Solidarity means the economy should foster empathy among
people, mutual respect and caring, rather than an attitude that
you are my enemy or, in any event, I don't care about your well
being.</p>

<p>Diversity merely testifies to a belief that homogeneity is
boring and we all benefit from diverse outcomes. Partly this is
because it is a good hedge against errors. Partly it is because
life is short and we can enjoy other people's different
involvements vicariously, etc.</p>

<p>Finally, participatory self management means that each person
should have a fair share of say over his or her own life. We
should be able to affect the decisions that in turn affect us,
and we should be able to do it in proportion as we are in turn
affected.</p>

<p>The claim is simple, in an economy, other things equal, if we
have more of these attributes, it is better. If we have less it
is worse.</p>

<p>At the same time, the economic function should be carried out
without waste (efficiency).</p>

<p>Classlessness is derivative because if you have classes, as
compared to not having them, you are worse on all these values.
class division reduces equity, curtails solidarity, reduces
diversity, and limits self management.</p>

<p>So, we can take our goals as the four noted, or as
classlessness, plus within the bounds of meeting those values,
economic efficiency.</p>

<p>For discussion purposes, if anyone wishes to argue that some
desirable value we would like to see implemented is left out if
we take these as our guides, please do. Or, for that matter, if
anyone wants to question any of this, likewise, please do. </p>

<p>My own personal justification for them is that they seem to me
to be consistent with and necessary for a maximum of personal
fulfillment and development for each individual and for the whole
population as a collective, consistent with the just norm that
everyone should have as good a shot at fulfillment and
development as anyone else.</p>

<p>These are going to be the values that guide my choices during
the class, but if anyone wants us to take into account others as
well, or instead, please suggest them.</p>

<h1 align=center>Other Internet Tools</h1>

<P>The World Wide Web is only one of the many services available on WOL and
the Internet. Perhaps you've already used <b>e-mail</b> (electronic mail),
which lets you send and receive information to and from anyone on WOL or
the Internet. But while e-mail and the web are the most popular Internet
applications, there are several other tools that come in handy from time to
time.

<a name="n"> </a>
<P><b>Newsgroups</b> are global discussion forums covering all sorts of
topics, including computers, recreation, science, social issues, and an
innumerable number of other subjects. <i>Usenet,</i> the system that
carries the newsgroups, uses a hierarchical naming scheme. For example, all
the newsgroups relating to social issues begin their names with
"<tt>soc.</tt>", and all of those groups that concern cultural discussions
start with "<tt>soc.culture.</tt>", so that that group on Brazillian
culture is <tt>soc.culture.brazil</tt>, Haitian culture is
<tt>soc.culture.haiti</tt>, and so on. (Notice the use of periods to
seperate the components of each name.) With some groups, the content is
moderated (e.g. <tt>soc.feminism</tt>), but most groups have no
restrictions at all (e.g. <tt>alt.feminism</tt>). There are thousands upon
thousands of newsgroups to choose from, containing postings from around the
world. Some web browsers have newsreading capabilities built in.

<ul>

Guide to the Internet: Usenet</a>
<li><a href="http://www.clari.net/brad/emily.html">Emily Postnews</a></b>
</ul>

<P>On WOL you have two ways to access Usenet newsgroups. Some groups are
available within WOL's forum area, for the most efficient possible access,
which you can use just as you would any other WOL forum. To access the rest
of Usenet, you can select a newsreader application from our <!--HREF
HERE>Internet Page and install it on your computer. (We suggest <!--HERE
TOO>Free Agent for Windows users.) Each of these applications comes with
its own instructions.

<a name="f"> </a>
<P><b>FTP</b> is a tool for transferring files. (It's short for <i>File
Transfer Protocal</i>.) You can download files on the World Wide Web (by
clicking on them), but FTP has the advantage of letting you send files to
another machine. When using FTP to connect to another machine, you need to
enter in a name and password -- don't worry, most FTP machines will let you
in if you enter "anonymous" for your name and your e-mail address for your
password. After that, FTP operates much like MS-DOS, if you've ever used
it: You type in short commands to navigate through directories and get or
put files. FTP is built in to most web browsers (though not all browsers
can send files -- you'll need a dedicated FTP program for that).

<ul>
<li><b><a
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/ftp-list/faq/faq.ht

</ul>

<P>For Windows users WOL also provides an excellent FTP tool, called
CuteFTP, via the WOL <!--HREF HERE>Internet Page. MAC Users can get a
comparable tool
from the WOL/ShareWorld Mac file library. Please consult the
instructions within WOL and your FTP programm's help system for more
information.

<a name="m"> </a>
<P><b>Mailing lists</b> are a special application of e-mail: You send an
e-mail message to a "listserver" (a specially configured machine) asking to
receive a particular mailing list. Then, whenever e-mail is posted to the
mailing list, the listserver will send copies to everyone on the list.
Typical mailing lists include newsletters and small discussion groups. For
example, to join ACTIV-L, a "discussion of peace, empowerment, justice and
environmental issues," send an e-mail message to <A
HREF="mailto:listserv@mizzou1.missouri.edu">listserv@mizzou1.missouri.edu</A
> containing the following text:

<blockquote>
<TT>subscribe ACTIV-L</TT>
</blockquote>

Be forewarned, however, that subscribing to too many mailing lists will
fill up your e-mail box with a large volume of mail. You can unsubscribe
from the above list by sending "<TT>signoff ACTIV-L</TT>" to the same
address. Other lists may require different commands for subscribing and
unsubscribing.

<li><a href="http://www.tile.net/tile/listserv/ecology.html">Ecology

</ul>

<a name="t"> </a>
<P><b>Telnet</b> lets you "log in" to another machine on the Internet. This
is most commonly used to access "shell accounts" on UNIX machines (which
give you your own little space on a large, powerful computer), but is also
used for a variety of other applications, such as library catalog systems,
or BBS access via the Internet. WOL itself can be accessed using telnet,
including the telnet capability of our WG software for Windows.

<a name="g"> </a>
<P><b>Gopher</b> is a system that organizes information into a series of
menus. You can navigate between different machines and directories, and
retrieve files files simply by selecting from the menu choices. Think of it
as a more "user-friendly" front-end for FTP and Telnet that also integrates
information from many different sources. The World Wide Web has surpassed
Gopher in many of these functions, but there are still many valuable
resources accessible through Gopher.

<a name="i"> </a>
<P><b>IRC</b> (<i>Internet Relay Chat</i>) is kind of like a "live" Usenet:
The discussion groups are called "channels," and communication happens in
real time. Once you join a channel, you can type messages that appear
immediately on the screens of everyone else connected to the same channel.
There are a variety of special commands you can learn to enhance the
experience.

<blockquote>
    <h2>What is an Economy?</h2>
    <p>How do you answer a question like this? It initially seems
    so vague and broad to most folks that they are largely
    stymied by it. I suppose we could look the answer up
    somewhere, but the idea in these lectures is for each of us
    to create our own answers to all the many questions we raise,
    not to go find and repeat someone else's, not least because
    existing answers may be wrong, or narrow, or even duplicitous.
    So, how about if we take it a step at a time. </p>
    <p>First, what happens in an economy? Well, of course people <i>consume</i>
    and <i>produce</i> things. So let's start with that: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>An economy is the set of institutions that
        facilitate and organize people producing and consuming things.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What then is <i>production</i>, what is <i>consumption</i>,
    what is an <i>institution</i>, and what does &#147;facilitate
    and organize&#148; mean? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Notice, we are already conceptualizing&#151;that is, we
    are taking the world and finding within it aspects that we
    want to focus our attention on, and refining our clarity
    about these highlighted aspects by giving them concept names
    such as &#147;economy,&#148; &#147;production,&#148;
    &#147;consumption,&#148; &#147;institution.&#148; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>The world is a huge interlocking web of
        &#147;Stuff.&#148; We pull from it components or facets that
        we want to highlight and to use as a basis for further
        analysis and understanding. These we give names and they become
        our concepts in our conceptual toolbox. Later, to create
        theory we explain our concepts' interrelations. To create
        vision we utilize our concepts to create new models. To
        explain events we relate the events to the dynamics of
        our concepts. We choose particular facets of the world to
        become our basic concepts because we feel that utilizing them
        at the core of our thinking will help us account for what
        is important without suffering more detail than we need.
        We choose our concepts, that is, in hopes they will take
        us straight to the heart of matters we care about. </i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>When production happens something new generally emerges,
    not from nothing but from stuff combined together in the act
    of production. Think about any <i>workplace</i>, such as a
    bicycle shop. The shop has <i>inputs</i> and <i>outputs</i>.
    The inputs are combined, the outputs result. The action in
    the middle, is called work. The place where this happens we
    call a workplace, such as Sally's Bike Repair Center. But&#133; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the inputs and outputs of production <i>processes</i>? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the first question you/we need to answer before
    lecture two. I'll get us started. In Sally's Bike Repair
    Center surely bikes come out and rubber and steel go in, but
    what about Sally herself and her state of being? Or consider
    an auto plant. One thing that goes in is glass. One that
    comes out is a Chevrolet. But doesn't much more actually
    enter the plant and leave it? You might want to think about it
    for a few minutes before continuing...and I hope many readers
    will answer in your own way, before you read my own answer as
    part of the opening section of next lecture. For now,
    however, if you are ready, let's just go on as if we already have
    the answer. </p>
    <p>So, knowing what the inputs and outputs of production are,
    how do we describe workplaces? They are institutions you
    might say. Fine. But what is that? If institution is to be a
    concept we use in our thinking, envisioning, etc., as I
    indeed I think it ought to be, what is the critical attribute
    that defines institutions, and that distinguishes one from
    another? </p>
    <p>(This is arguably the hardest part of
    theorizing&#151;reaching out into the familiar world and
    settling on basic concepts, including clarifying for
    ourselves just what, in fact, we mean by them and doing it in
    a way that helps us later rather than narrowing our perceptions
    so that try as we might, we never make further progress. Our
    concepts draw us toward some facets, highlight some
    relations, attune us to seeing some features, but they also inevitably
    leave out other facets, obscure other relations, and turn us
    away from other features. If our concepts efficiently focus
    us on what matters for our investigative, analytic, or
    visionary purpose, they are good. But if they turn us away
    from what matters, or include so much that is peripheral that
    we can't ever get to the core of things, then fail us.) </p>
    <p>So, again, what is an institution? Is it the floor plan?
    Is it the size of the building, or even the existence of a
    building? Is it the speed things happen at? The quality of
    the results? These characteristics are often important, of
    course, for various concerns that one might have, but I think
    we can all agree they are not at the heart of the matter from
    a broad economic and social perspective. But if they are not
    at the heart of what we want to focus on when we use the concept
    &#147;institution,&#148; what is? </p>
    <p>Well, we know that there is something similar about, say,
    GM, Microsoft, and the local cannery that makes them all
    workplaces, and that this is presumably what we want to get a
    grip on when addressing issues of work and production. It
    isn't their specific size, products, buildings, or locales. GM,
    Microsoft, and the local cannery have almost nothing in
    common on these axes. What they do have in common is instead
    something about the relations that exist, day in and day out,
    among the actors who get together in these
    institutions&#151;something about their motivations,
    interests, behaviors, and choices. And this is what we
    implicitly have foremost in mind, it seems to me, when we
    refer to an institution. We are not referring so much to
    material structures as to <i>role structures</i>. So let's
    just make this explicit. That is, to define our basic concept
    &#147;institution&#148; suppose we say that: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3"><i>An institution is a collection of
        social roles (plus, peripherally, some infrastructure and
        perhaps equipment, and the people who fill the roles).
        Where by social roles we mean things like union steward, mother,
        judge, manager, CEO, owner, worker.</i> </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But now, with this concept in our toolbox, we can easily
    see that the critical thing linking the businesses mentioned
    above is that they all embody the same basic defining role
    structures having to do with <i>capitalists</i>, <i>workers</i>,
    managers, and so on, whose character we will investigate
    shortly. More, in different economies it follows that we will
    have qualitatively different types of economic institutions,
    due to their having qualitatively different role structures.
    Feudalism has serfs and lords and what not, <i>capitalism</i>
    has its own roles, and any new economic vision we come up
    with will have its own unique roles as well. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>In any economy, therefore, we have workplaces which
        have role structures by which production takes place via
        inputs and outputs. So if we are going to define an economic
        vision, part of the job will be defining these production
        institutions, and particularly their role structures.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So here are some more questions to consider as you proceed
    with this lecture and preparatory to the next one. As usual;
    my own answers will appear at the start of next lecture. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the primary roles within capitalist
            workplaces? </li>
        <li>Is a public school a workplace? What about a GM
            factory or a family? How about a church or school?
            Why or why not? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Consumption</h2>
    <p>Now, taking up a new component of economics, we already
    have something to organize and discipline our thinking, at
    least a little. That is, have defined one type of <i>economic
    activity</i>, which we have called production. We have said
    it has inputs and outputs (which you are supposed to be thinking
    about and we will get to in more detail soon), and have said
    that it is carried out in production institutions, or
    workplaces, and that these have role structures (that you are
    also hopefully thinking about, and that we will also address
    further shortly). One important part of the art of doing theoretical,
    explanatory, or visionary work is to develop concepts and
    then build on them by only adding new ones when they are
    really needed. No sense adding more things to remember unless
    they really help us. Before adding to our conceptual toolbox,
    therefore, we should always try to make do with what we already
    have in it. So what about consumption? Do we need some new
    concepts to handle it, or not? </p>
    <p>We immediately recognize that consumption is another
    economic activity. It too has inputs and outputs that we can
    further conceptualize. It too is carried out in context of
    institutions which have role structures we can discern and
    describe. Since these few concepts go a long way, we already
    have some more questions to deal with as we proceed: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the inputs and outputs of <i>consumption
            activity?</i> </li>
        <li>What distinguishes consumption activity from <i>production activity?</i> </li>
        <li>What are some consumption activity roles? </li>
        <li>Is a factory, a school, or a family a consumption
            institution? Why or why not? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>See what comes to mind for these questions, if you have
    some time for it, and we will get to them shortly. And always
    try at first to answer using just the conceptual toolbox we
    are developing. If you can't, then add more concepts until
    you can. But don't leap to answer from prior common sense or school
    knowledge, etc. Try to answer only from the concepts we are
    developing, and then appeal to your knowledge more broadly
    only insofar as you must to augment what you can say within
    our new conceptual framework. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Allocation</h2>
    <p>Now we turn to the sticky question of facilitating and
    organizing the economic activities production and
    consumption. What does this entail (in addition to another
    concept, <i>allocation</i>)? </p>
    <p>Well, we know that there are a whole lot of people
    consuming and producing, and we know that there are a whole
    lot of places where all this activity goes on. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>So allocation is the name we give the institutions and
        process by which and through which it is determined what
        the inputs and outputs of the economy's activities will
        be and where they will wind up.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In each production institution, that is, we can ask what
    is produced, how much, with what steps, by whom? And for each person
    and group of people, we can ask what is consumed, how much,
    and how is it gotten? Moreover, how does what is produced
    come to match what is sought for consumption and vice versa?
    How do outputs match up with inputs? </p>
    <p>The answer to all these queries is that all this mixing
    and matching and determining is called allocation and is
    mediated by allocation institutions whose character may
    differ, of course, from economy to economy. </p>
    <p>The <i>market, </i>for example<i>,</i> is an allocation
    institution. And so is <i>central planning</i>. And we might dream
    up some other allocation institutions as well, including say,
    decentralizing the economy into little separate
    self-sufficient units so that allocation is carried on entirely
    face-to-face by some type of barter. Each of these means of
    allocation, the market, central planning, and face-to-face
    barter, for example, are structural ways of determining who
    does what, where, in what quantities, for whom. They are
    institutions, which tells us, given our growing conceptual
    toolbox and its lengthening insights into underlying economic
    components, that they embody particular roles that people
    must fill to benefit from the institution's offerings. </p>
    <p>Once we think of markets as an institution, that is, we
    know that we need to describe the associated role structure.
    Likewise if we think of central planning this way, again, we
    have to describe the roles associated with central planning. </p>
    <p>For markets, for example, we have <i>buyers</i> and <i>sellers</i>.
    There may be other refinements in a particular market
    economy, but we could go a long way toward figuring out the
    defining features of markets if we revealed the
    institutionally determined motivations and behaviors of these
    buyers and sellers and how their behaviors combine to
    influence allocation. For central planning we have order
    givers (<i>planners</i>) and order takers (<i>workers</i>)
    and about these roles we should ask, supposing that we want
    to understand central planning, what motivations do they
    impose, what implications do they have? Moreover, for any
    economic vision we will need to do the same thing: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Describe the allocation institution in terms of the roles
        that it defines for economic actors and the ensuing
        dynamics and processes these promote and their
        implications for who does what, who gets what, etc.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In light of our new concept, allocation, some new
    questions arise for our consideration: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a market economy, what determines how much of the <i>product</i>
            each actor gets? </li>
        <li>And what determines, in a market economy, how much <i>work</i> each
            actor does? </li>
        <li>What is <i>investment</i> and what does it have to do
            with allocation? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So we have now gotten to the point where we can somewhat clarify
    what we are trying to do. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>To define an economic vision, we need to define production,
        consumption, and allocation institutions that work
        successfully together and have qualities we like.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How do we know, however, what it is that we like? Suppose someone
    asked you what you think an economy ought to do to be a good
    economy. This is not so easy to answer. So, to proceed with defining
    an economic vision, we need to focus in on the valuative issues. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Evaluating Economies and Determining What We Want </h2>
    <p>Economies affect people. This is pretty obvious but
    nonetheless important to understand in more detail. Economies
    influence what we do (by providing roles we have to fill) and
    what we get from their productive output (by their allocation
    outcomes). These two facts in turn have much to do with our
    possible life stories. Are we doing interesting or boring
    things at work? Do we have power over our circumstances or
    are we bossed around by others? Do we starve, get by, or
    enjoy luxury? What happens to our personalities and
    potentials in the work we do and the consuming we opt for? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Evaluating an economy means asking how its institutions
        affect people. What are the built-in implications for
        people's lives of the economy's production, consumption,
        and allocation institutions when they operate as they are
        structured to?</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If the economy propels anti-social attitudes or distorts
    and under utilizes human capabilities, or if it rewards
    people unjustly, these would be issues to take up in
    evaluating it. To make a judgment we must have some view of
    what is good and bad in the built-in dynamics of the economy
    and their inevitable implications for people's lives. So we
    have to broadly decide what we would like an economy to
    achieve. </p>
    <p>There are many possible answers: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>We might want an economy to simply maximize output
            for our society. The economy that can yield the
            biggest pile of produced stuff is the one we want,
            regardless of other effects. </li>
        <li>We might want an economy which ensures that some set
            of people get the most possible return regardless of
            total output or what anyone else gets. </li>
        <li>We might want an economy which yields identical
            outcomes for everyone, with the largest output
            consistent with that degree of equality. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>I don't like any of these options, however, for pretty
    obvious reasons. The first could yield a gigantic pile of
    garbage, weapons, or other stuff unsuited to human
    fulfillment and development. The second is elitist, enriching
    some at the cost of others. The third is mindlessly
    egalitarian; we all have different interests, tastes, and inclinations
    so that this type of homogeneity is not an aim, but a nightmare. </p>
    <p>I am going to instead propose some broad goals: <i>equity, solidarity,
    diversity, participatory self management</i>, plus <i>efficiency</i>,
    and, by implication, <i>classlessness</i>. </p>
    <p>We could argue about these, I suppose, forever. My reasons
    for choosing these as the economic aims I want to see
    embodied in an economy probably stem from all manner of
    influences on my own thinking and values. But, I think among
    people concerned about social change, these broad goals should
    be pretty uncontroversial, save insofar as we might wonder if
    a system can address them all simultaneously or if they are
    sufficiently comprehensive to give us a system we will like. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Equity says we should have fair or just outcomes. No
        one should get more of a good thing or of a bad thing
        than he or she deserves. </i></p>
        <p><i>Solidarity means the economy should foster empathy among
        people and mutual respect and caring, rather than an
        attitude that you are my enemy or, in any event, that I
        don't care about your well being.</i> </p>
        <p><i>Diversity testifies to a belief that homogeneity is boring
        and we all benefit from diverse outcomes. Partly this is
        because it is a good hedge against errors. Partly it is because
        life is short and we can enjoy other people's different
        involvements vicariously.</i> </p>
        <p><i>Participatory self management means each person should
        be able to affect the decisions that in turn affect him
        or her, and we should each be able to do this in proportion
        as we are affected by those decisions.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>My overarching claim on behalf of these broad aims is very simple.
    In an economy, other things equal, if we have more of these
    attributes, it is better. If we have less, it is worse. More, these
    values together create comprehensive norms that can weed out
    bad and highlight good economic structures. And of course, finally,
    the economic functions to produce, consume, and allocate in
    light of people's preferences and capacities and to attain
    these broader aims, should be carried out without waste (efficiency). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><i>Classlessness,</i> for example, is derivative of these
    aims because if you have classes rather than classlessness
    you are worse on all these values. Class division reduces
    equity, curtails solidarity, reduces diversity, limits self
    management, and introduces various inefficiencies. So on the
    road to meeting the above criteria, you also strive toward
    classlessness. </p>
    <p>But, to proceed interactively, one thing you might wish to
    do is consider whether you think there may be some desirable
    value you would like to see implemented in a good economy
    that will be left out if we take just my favorites as our
    guides. Or, for that matter, you might want to question the
    desirability of any of these. </p>
    <p>Again, my own personal justification for these four values
    (plus efficiency in attaining them) is that they seem to me
    to be consistent with and necessary for a maximum of personal fulfillment
    and development for each individual and for the whole population
    as a collective, consistent with the just norm that everyone
    should have as good a shot at fulfillment and development as
    anyone else, and to also be comprehensive for purely economic
    valuation of economic components. These are therefore going
    to be the values that guide my choices during the following
    lectures, but if you wish to take into account other values
    as well, or instead, please do so as you proceed. The same methodology
    I will be using with my favored values should prove apt for
    you with yours, in any event. And here is another question to
    ponder. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do you think of this discussion of values and economics,
            and what alternative suggestions might you have for
            the value system we utilize in our work to come? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, here is a recounting of the questions raised this
    lecture for you to consider one last time before moving on. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the inputs, and what are the outputs of
            production processes? </li>
        <li>What are the primary roles within capitalist
            workplaces? </li>
        <li>Is a public school a workplace, a GM factory, a
            family? Why or why not? </li>
        <li>What are the inputs and outputs of consumption
            activity? </li>
        <li>What distinguishes consumption activity from
            production activity? </li>
        <li>What are some consumption activity roles? </li>
        <li>Is a factory, a school, a family a consumption
            institution? Why or why not? </li>
        <li>In a market economy, what determines how much of the product
            each actor gets? </li>
        <li>And what determines, in a market economy, how much
            work each actor does? </li>
        <li>What is investment and what does it have to do with allocation? </li>
        <li>What do you think of our discussion of values and economics,
            and what alternative suggestions do you have for values
            to utilize in our work to come?. </li>
    </ol>

<hr>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This lecture focuses on various existing economic options
    and evaluates their production, consumption, and allocation
    role structures in light of the values we enunciated in
    lecture 1. First, however, I need to offer my own answers to the
    questions raised last lecture. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 1 Questions</h2>
    <p>A word, first, about the point of these questions. The
    really important things overall in these exercises are: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>To think about economic concepts and vision
            methodically and comprehensively. The usual approach
            is, instead, to apply some experiences, or lessons,
            or beliefs, or a little thought, and race to conclusions.
            This is often OK in life&#151;often, indeed, there is
            no time for more. But when trying to theorize some
            domain (such as economics) or design some system
            (such as an economy) far more care and discipline is needed. </li>
        <li>To actually believe in our own thoughts and draw conclusions
            from them. I mean this seriously. The vast majority
            of folks would, I think, arrive at views quite disdainful
            of existing structures, were they to do these exercises
            in a non-threatening context. But, having done this, it
            would then have few if any implications for many
            people's attitudes toward the structures addressed,
            or the actual economy we live in. Some kind of weight
            of experience, or history, or pessimism, or whatever,
            would override their reasoned assessments. Instead,
            we should (i) develop concepts and aims, (ii) apply
            the concepts to understand situations and processes
            in light of aims, and (iii) reject what fails, and
            support what seems worthy. We have to be flexible and
            humble about our judgments, of course. But I don't
            see arriving at views, and then dispensing with them in conversations
            with friends, in our estimates of our role in society,
            etc. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So what about the questions asked last lecture? Taking the
    content of lecture 1 as a starting point, and in light of our
    purposes, the following brief answers would be more than
    satisfactory, to my thinking. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the inputs, and what are the outputs of
            production processes? </li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Inputs</i> include material items (such as resources,
    goods produced elsewhere, and infrastructure), but also people's
    work or labor, people themselves (including the level of
    knowledge they have, health, the moods and levels of fulfillment
    they have, their personalities, skills, etc.), and the social
    relations of the workplace (including the roles of the
    workplace and the rules of its operation, relations between
    actors, etc.). Saying these are <i>all</i> inputs means that
    all these entities enter into the production process as
    aspects needed for it to occur and influencing its outcomes,
    being reproduced, altered, or used up in the process. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>As obvious as every aspect of the above answer is once one
    sees them listed, many people indicating inputs stop with
    material things plus people's work. But despite the fact that
    &#147;material things plus work&#148; is also the answer most often
    offered by mainstream economists and even most schools of radical economists,
    this is woefully inadequate. Imagine a psychologist listing
    human interests and leaving out sex, or a nutritionist
    listing inputs to the body and leaving out vitamins.
    Similarly, what sense does it make to list economic inputs
    and leave out people's skills, knowledge, and emotions? </p>
    <p>Well, in fact, the strange truth is that for some purposes
    this can make good sense. </p>
    <p>Remember, we choose concepts to highlight features that we
    care about and that we need to pay attention to for our
    subsequent thinking and visualizing to be effective. But what
    if your priority was only to maximize profits for an owner,
    regardless of effects on anyone else save insofar as these effects mattered
    for the size of profits? Then for you to use concepts that
    left out certain features that we as citizens or workers
    might think are important to include, given our different
    priorities, makes sense. This is why the &#147;bottom line&#148;
    for accountants paid by owners of companies, does not include any reference
    whatever to the effect of economic life on producers and
    consumers, but only includes reference to monetary costs and
    revenues and, ultimately, profits. The theorist has an
    agenda, and what matters to that agenda is conceptualized, while
    what doesn't matter to it, or what might distract from it, is avoided. </p>
    <p>In any event, to continue with the answer to the question
    raised, <i>outputs</i> of production processes certainly
    include material items (such as the intended material
    products and by-products of the production process, whether desirable
    or harmful, including pollution, etc.), and services
    produced, but also include people (with potentially changed
    knowledge, health, moods and fulfillment levels, personalities,
    skills, etc.) and social relations (which, likewise, may be
    altered due to the production process). Here too the absence of
    the latter two categories of output from production typifies
    most economists' views and, obviously, once the point is
    made, consigns them to inadequacy&#151;at least regarding our
    priorities. For how could you possibly evaluate a production institution vis--vis
    its effects on solidarity, equity, diversity, and self
    management, if you don't even include in the conceptual tool box
    you use to examine the institution reference to its affects
    on human personality, knowledge, skills, and social
    relations? </p>
    <p>How could it make any sense to list the inputs and outputs
    of work and not list the state of being of the people who participate
    in it and the state of social relations among them if one is
    concerned with designing (or evaluating) economic models to
    benefit people? How can you design the model to benefit factor
    x, when you leave factor x out of the conceptual apparatus
    you use in building your model in the first place? You can't,
    obviously. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, however, to repeat a critical point for understanding
    the logic of conceptual systems and theories, if your focus
    is not people per se, but profit or material surplus, and if you
    care about people only insofar as you must to address these other
    profit or power centered aims, then different criteria guide what
    parts of reality you decide to highlight. That is, with
    profits as your priority it makes sense, however inhumane it
    may be, to use concepts that leave effects on people out of
    the analytic picture save insofar as the effects bear on profits. </p>
    <p>I want to elaborate (perhaps beat to death would be a
    better term for what I am doing) this point about concepts just
    a bit further before proceeding to the next question. </p>
    <p>We are trying to build a theory. We want concepts that
    highlight what we care about, and anything that significantly
    effects what we care about. Someone might say that air goes
    in the windows of the workplace&#151;but who cares? Or that
    dirt goes into the workplace congealed to the incoming raw materials,
    but this too is not something to put in our theory at the
    level of basic concepts. But what is it that we do care about
    in a workplace&#151;and, in light of that, what goes in? </p>
    <p>Each worker has a certain physical condition going in, and perhaps
    another, even including a lost limb, say, or just plain exhaustion,
    coming out. Notice, if we simply elide this from our theory&#151;ignore
    it, leave it out, not have any concepts that focus on it&#151;then
    the recognition leaves our thoughts as well. This is precisely
    what happens in what is called neoclassical economics, or professional
    economics, or economics propaganda, as I might label it. Why propaganda?
    Because from the start the framework highlights only some
    facets and ignores others (this much is in fact true of any
    intellectual framework) <i>according to a criteria that distorts
    understanding in the interests of elites and ignores the plight
    of workers</i>. Here is something to think about, therefore, and in
    light of all this: Is what we are doing merely a different
    kind of propaganda, now taking the perspective of workers but
    ignoring the conditions and interests of elites? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the primary roles within capitalist
            workplaces? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, there are those who own the place and by virtue of
    this have a claim on profits and have ultimate authority over
    operations. They may have inherited their deed to ownership,
    or they may have begun the firm themselves and worked
    fantastically hard making it successful, or they may have bought
    it. Regardless, we call these folks capitalists. </p>
    <p>Then there are those who have considerable control over
    their own circumstances of work and usually also over the
    definition of or the conditions of the work of many other
    people as well. They have their position as manager, engineer,
    lawyer, doctor, etc., by virtue of educational certification and
    monopolized skills, knowledge, and access to information and decision-making authority.
    I call these folks <i>coordinators</i>. </p>
    <p>And then there are people who have nearly no control over
    their own conditions of work, or over anyone else's either,
    and whose circumstances are determined only by their ability
    to win higher wages or better conditions through organization
    with others in like straits, the workers. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Of course, we could refine endlessly beyond this, but
    these three <i>classes</i> are, I think, a sufficient demarcation
    for most broad analytic and visionary purposes. With contrary
    interests to one another and different world views arising
    from the different roles they fulfill in the economy, these
    three classes contend over quality of circumstance and share
    of productive output, as well as for power over outcomes.
    They even have different agendas for what an economy should be...a
    point we have already touched on in explaining why mainstream economic
    theory leaves out some focuses that we find critical. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is a public school a workplace; what about a GM
            factory, a family? Why or why not? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we define a workplace as a place where inputs are
    transformed into outputs, then, yes, of course, all these are workplaces.
    If we confine the term workplace to refer to places where
    production in this broad sense occurs and where it is also
    the primary defining feature of the institution, then no, the school
    and family are not workplaces. It is really a matter of the
    conceptual breadth that we want our choice of words to have
    at any given time. In fact, since such institutions must
    partake of economic involvement to get their inputs and
    provide their outputs, I think it makes sense to pay attention
    to them as workplaces to precisely that extent. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the inputs and outputs of consumption
            activity? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Actually consumption and production are each economic
    activity, distinguishable only by the fact that in the former
    the focus is on the items taken in (and the level of human
    fulfillment immediately resulting) whereas in the latter the
    focus is on the items (material or service) made available as outputs.
    But really, the answer for inputs and outputs to production
    does quite nicely for inputs and outputs of consumption as
    well, with only a few minor word changes. In and out of each
    we have material things (some natural and some produced, some
    sought, and some as by-products), and people including their
    mood, fulfillment, and attributes (changing, perhaps, along
    the way), and social relations (again, subject to change). </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What distinguishes consumption activity from
            production activity? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The focus of attention of the person doing the labeling. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are some consumption activity roles? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ah, now there is some difference because of the
    institution in which most of what we will generally want to
    call production (due to its focus) or consumption (due to its
    focus) takes place. Consumption, as we will most often use
    the word, occurs via choices made in some living unit or
    group of such units, often with roles that are highly influenced
    by gender relations, community relations, etc. </p>
    <p>Thus, in different societies with different organization
    of living units, there may be quite different attitudes about consumption
    and different rules by which it is carried out. Does a
    patriarch make all choices, or parents, or a tribal elder,
    for example? Are there taboos and requirements? Do people meet and
    discuss options before determining what they want? Do
    children have a say, or take what they are given? </p>
    <p>Of course, it is also relevant to consider the degree to
    which class allegiance alters one's consumption role by affecting
    one's attitudes, options, and so on. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is a factory, a school, or a family a consumption
            institution? Why or why not? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clearly, yes, if we view them in terms of what they take
    in, or in terms of their place in the economy as recipients of
    outputs from elsewhere. Which is exactly how we ought to view
    them when we are thinking about the consumption part of
    economic activity. However, when we have on other hats, these
    institutions rightfully take on other primary aspects. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a market, what determines how much product each
            actor gets? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Power, which can in turn be affected by many variables
    such as monopolization, unionization, consciousness and organization, prior distribution
    of wealth and assets, race, gender, age, laws, government intervention,
    supply and demand, and so on. </p>
    <p>Perhaps I should have said bargaining power. The concept
    is, however, a bit of a catch all. For example, suppose you
    produce some needed product and corner the market&#151;that
    is, you become a monopoly or monopsony. You now have more
    power then if there were many other firms offering the product. You
    can extract more payment. Or imagine you are a small business
    and I am a very big client of yours&#151;you depend on me to
    exist and I could go elsewhere. Then you have another small client
    who can't go elsewhere to get your service or product, and depends
    on you. I have great relative power in our transaction. But
    you have great relative power in the transaction with the smaller
    client. </p>
    <p>Suppose I am a worker in a union, or not in a union, my
    bargaining power changes. Suppose I am a woman or Latino
    worker. In a racist or sexist context or a society in which
    these oppressive dynamics are absent, my bargaining power
    changes. </p>
    <p>The point is, in a market economy buyers and sellers do
    not, as the rhetoric informs us, meet with prices and the character
    of the exchange globally set regardless of their individual
    relations. Instead, prices for the same good and services for
    the same payment often vary dramatically depending on the relative bargaining
    power of the buyers and sellers. If people living in a poor community
    cannot travel far at all, then a local supermarket may be able
    to charge them more for carrots than the same supermarket
    would be able to charge rich people in a different neighborhood,
    able to shop elsewhere. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>And what determines, in a market economy, how much
            work each actor does? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, power, and the wills of the actors who have the
    power to manifest. Thus we have struggle over the length of
    the work day, or work intensity, etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is investment and what does it have to do with allocation? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Investment is just a decision to apply certain resources,
    energies, and materials to creating new productive facilities,
    relations, and capacities to be utilized in the future. It is
    important by virtue of influencing the playing field tomorrow
    and thereafter. The relation to allocation is that some
    amount of society's product is earmarked, during the
    allocation process, for investment rather than for meeting
    immediate ends. The word is not intrinsically pejorative and
    has no accompanying implication regarding who gets what or the
    goals of innovations, etc. Investment in a particular type of
    economy, however, will be contoured by that economy's norms
    to have certain qualities, which we may or may not like. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>So, what do you think of this discussion of values
            and economics, and what alternative suggestions might
            you have for the value system we utilize in our work
            to come? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The best way for me to answer this question will be to
    proceed with lecture 2. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Further Discussion of Values and Economies</h2>
    <p>As noted in Lecture 1 economies influence what we do (by providing
    roles that we have to fill) and what we get from the productive
    output (by affecting allocation outcomes). These two facts in
    turn have much to do with our possible life stories. </p>
    <p>If the economy propels anti-social attitudes or distorts
    and under-utilizes human capabilities, or if it rewards people
    unjustly or creates hostilities among people, or if it wastes
    time and effort needlessly or inexorably distorts personalities
    or violates the ecology, these would be issues to take up in evaluating
    it. The task is to assess the built-in dynamics of the
    economy and their inevitable implications for people's lives. </p>
    <p>So what would we like an economy to achieve in the way of broad
    general aims for people's lives? I noted last lecture four values,
    plus some basic economic criteria, meant to be necessary and
    (at the broad level) also sufficient as evaluative norms for designing
    and judging economies. Now let's develop each just a bit
    further. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>First, equity says that we should have fair or just outcomes.
        No one should get more of a good thing, or of a bad
        thing, than he or she deserves.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The idea isn't, however, to have a fair playing field and
    then a race, like a land grab, in which everyone starts at the
    same time with no advantages. In such contests outcomes can
    and generally are still unequal even if we go so far as to
    handicap fast runners with extra weight&#151;that's why
    people run like maniacs, because some get good land and some
    bad. </p>
    <p>Our aim isn't, therefore, to have a fair contest but with
    gross disparity of outcome. Our aim is to attain fair outcomes.
    And so the question arises, well, what is fair? In talking
    about material distribution and about life circumstances,
    what should be our criteria for what people get? And so we have
    our first thought question for this lecture, to be answered
    preparatory to undertaking lecture 3: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Beyond a vague notion of equity, what should be the
            actual criteria of remuneration and disposition of economic responsibilities?
            How do we determine how much people are paid, what
            share of output they receive? </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Second, solidarity means the economy should foster empathy among
        people, mutual respect and caring, rather than an attitude
        that you are my enemy or, in any event, I don't care about
        your well being.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This value requires little explanation, I think. If
    economic functions and requirements produce sociality and solidarity,
    good. If they produce hostility and anti-social attitudes,
    bad. It would seem that to contest this is impossible for all
    but a psychopath. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Third, diversity merely testifies to a belief that homogeneity
        is boring and we all benefit from diverse outcomes.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Partly this is because diversity of outcomes is a good
    hedge against errors. If everything is always done one way, then
    if that one way is wrong, one has to start from scratch. But
    if there are generally many approaches being utilized and
    employed, then when one proves detrimental there are others
    to choose among, well conceived and tested. And partly
    diversity is valuable because life is short and we can enjoy
    other people's different involvements vicariously, or via
    their product. We get pleasure, that is, vicariously appreciating
    the products and attainments and life stories of others who choose different
    pursuits than ours. We need to put diversity in our brief list, as
    compared to many other values we might mention, because
    otherwise one could attain the other three aims we have enumerated
    by simply homogenizing everything into exact oneness. It is
    not derivative, therefore, but essential to the list. </p>
    <p><i>Finally, fourth, participatory self management means
    that each person should have a fair say over his or her own
    life.</i> </p>
    <p>But what is a fair say? Well, we should be able to affect
    the decisions that in turn affect us, and we should be able to
    do it in proportion as we are in turn affected. But please
    notice&#151;this is not just one person one vote nor is it consensus
    decision-making, for that matter. One person one vote is sometimes useful, sometimes
    not, because it gives identical impact on outcomes to each person,
    not proportionate impact. Likewise consensus is also sometimes useful,
    sometimes not, because it ultimately gives veto power to each participant. </p>
    <p>Clearly there is no point, pragmatic or ethical, in the
    person on the other side of the plant having the same say as
    I do (much less veto power) over how I arrange my desk space.
    To give others that power over my space is not democracy in
    action, but a kind of silly knee-jerk notion of democracy leading to
    waste, bedlam, or fisticuffs. Participatory self management
    instead allots to each actor a say in decisions proportionate
    to the degree the actor is affected by the decisions. This
    seems to us to be what most people really mean by democracy,
    and to be what we ought to mean by it, in any event. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>The last requirement for an economy, which goes more
        or less without saying, is that it also fulfill economic
        aims: that is, it has to deliver the products desired,
        and it has to do this without wasting anything that
        people care about (which is called, being efficient).</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So what is efficiency? To most people, this is not so
    obvious, I think, and therefore bears just a bit more comment.
    The answer is, in the abstract, there is no such thing. There
    is only efficiency in light of some set of aims and valuations. </p>
    <p>Efficiency means utilizing &#147;assets&#148; fully,
    effectively, without waste. If you have waste, then you could attain whatever
    positive ends you got without the waste (if it is inevitable
    it isn't waste) and therefore with improvement. So you do
    want to be efficient in the sense of avoiding waste. </p>
    <p>But, notice, if we say that the end sought is maximizing
    output, or profits (which is not the same) and we place no value
    on, for example, the well being of the work force (so this is
    not an asset we care about), then not utilizing every last
    ounce of energy, even if it means disempowering workers
    entirely, is inefficient. On the other hand, if we value
    worker well being so that we see it as an asset that we care
    about or even part of the goal, then we get a very different
    view of what is efficient and what isn't. </p>
    <p>In our society the word efficient is taken to mean not
    wasteful, but also correct, mature, professional, careful, reasoned,
    and so on, and is therefore deemed good. But it is also taken
    to mean getting the most profit from available inputs
    regardless of the impact on anyone or anything outside the transaction.
    Which is not so good. And therein arises the confusion. </p>
    <p>In any event, to return to our list of values, my claim
    about these evaluative criteria is intuitively pretty obvious but
    hard to demonstrate logically. </p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>In an economy, other things equal, if we have more of
            these attributes, the economy is better. If we have
            less, it is worse. </li>
        <li>If we attain all these aims to a great degree, we
            will also attain or be in a position to attain virtually
            any other desirable economic value anyone could
            propose. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The list of broad aims is useful, therefore, in being both
    necessary and sufficient to our over all goals. Economies often
    demarcate people into groups with opposed interests such that
    people in one such group are better off than people in
    others, have more power, and so on. These economically
    defined groups are called classes, and classlessness, for
    example, is a an aim that emerges naturally from those we
    have chosen because if you have classes, as compared to not
    having them, you are worse on all these values. Class division
    reduces equity (the dominant class has more than its
    subordinates), curtails solidarity (classes struggle with one another),
    reduces diversity (within classes homogeneity is the rule),
    and limits self management (as one class has preponderant power
    over others). The elimination of classes improves on all these
    criteria. So, with our values as guide, clearly no classes is better
    than classes... </p>
    <p>What about ecology? How come we don't have a separate
    value for, say, sustainability? Certainly lots of progressive
    economists do list such a value and of course we in fact have
    such values ourselves. So why not list it? Is it really
    implicit in the four that we do list? </p>
    <p>I will first tell you the actual history. When we first
    developed the parecon model, Robin Hahnel and I thought about
    this stuff pretty much as you are doing in these exercises,
    though over a longer time, of course. But when we thought
    about values to organize our structures around, the aims that
    roles we would advocate would try to attain, we came up with
    the values I offered here and nothing about ecology. I have
    to admit, with some embarrassment, that this wasn't because
    we self consciously assessed the possibility of including an ecological
    value and decided not to. The truth is, it just wasn't on our
    minds. </p>
    <p>Now the interesting thing is, I think, it didn't matter
    that we were not as self conscious as we ought to have been about
    this issue. That is, I honestly think the economy that
    emerges from applying the values so far listed is just as good re
    the ecology as it would have been had we put in another value highlighting the
    ecology. I'll go even further. I think it is better re the
    ecology than what many Greens advocate for the economy,
    starting from sustainability as their primary aim. </p>
    <p>Why do I say these things? </p>
    <p>Well, the values we have enumerated will cause us to
    require of our economic institutions that they account for ecological
    effects insofar as these impact on human well being and
    development. The values we have chosen will not, however,
    cause us to design our economic institutions to have built-in
    features for judging the ecology, or nature, or particular
    species, regardless of implications for people. And I happen
    to think this makes good sense. If a society wants to impose
    on its economy that regardless of economic impact on people a
    particular species must be defended, for example, that is
    fine. And the economy ought to be able to accommodate such extra-economic
    (in this case ecological) requirements. But the economy
    itself should not do this <i>a priori</i>. The economy&#151;in
    my view, anyhow&#151;ought to provide people the means to
    determine their economic actions in accord with their desires
    and capacities and in tune with others doing likewise, but
    without prejudging issues that are extra-economic. </p>
    <p>Some Greens, as another example, argue that scale of
    operations, or degree of industry, are critical matters that must
    be dealt with in principle at the level of guiding values.
    They will argue, that is, that a good economy is one that always
    and aggressively (or even maximally) promotes small scale, or that utilizes
    industry only as a last resort. I think, instead, that such
    aims, as a matter of principle, make no sense at all
    economically (or ecologically, for that matter, but that is
    another story). What an economy ought to do is settle on scale
    of operations for firms, for example, or on levels and types
    of technologies, all in accord with higher values, such as,
    in our case, equity, self management, and so on. Sometimes a larger
    scale will make sense for a project or workplace, sometimes
    smaller. Sometimes new technologies ought to be utilized,
    sometimes not. The idea is that the economy should provide actors
    the information needed to make these judgments, rather than
    making the judgments <i>a priori</i>, due to some built-in abstract
    norm. </p>
    <p>Still, at each step in these lectures, you should, if you
    feel this value (sustainability) or any other value strongly
    as an independent aim, consider whether what I am saying is
    missing something or not. And attempt to incorporate whatever
    additional features, or change whatever features I offer as
    you see fit, for your own developing economic vision. </p>
    <p>To summarize, I think the models we develop using the
    values enunciated here will be attuned to ecological valuations
    and choices precisely insofar as these impact on human well
    being and development--and will also be able to be constrained
    by ecological choices that might be made on other grounds,
    for example, the rights of nature, or whatever else. Our
    economic vision will, of course, attend to sustainability,
    since to have an economy that isn't sustainable is
    catastrophic from the human point of view. </p>
    <p>So, for now anyway, and with the caveat that you must do otherwise
    if you see fit to, we can plausibly take our goals as the four
    noted, plus, within the bounds of meeting those values and human
    needs generally, economic efficiency. Could we choose other
    combinations of values that might also be as necessary and as
    sufficient? Sure, yes, I think perhaps we could. These few are chosen,
    I suppose we could say, out of experience/intuition and in the expectation/hope
    that they are well-suited to guiding economic evaluation and design.
    I think they make our job easier than some other ways of
    highlighting things, and so until the experience of using
    them proves otherwise, I proceed. Indeed, this is always why
    we choose concepts, methods, and values for our toolbox. We
    want to put in what is useful to attaining our intellectual
    and practical aims. And we want to leave out what would waste
    our time or distract or distort our efforts. Too little
    detail or any wrong detail is no good. But so is too much detail. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Existing Economic Models</h2>
    <p>Suppose someone asked how many different stereo systems
    are there to choose from. You might make a list of the major components
    (suppose it is amp, receiver, speakers) and then count the
    instances in each group. If there were 20 types of amp, and
    15 types of receiver, and 40 types of speaker, (not just different colors,
    but really different types) and if you could mix and match these
    in any combination, then there would be 20x15x40 = 12,000 different unique
    types of stereo system to choose from. If some components
    were incompatible with others, however, the total would drop,
    perhaps quite a bit. </p>
    <p>Now consider economies. How many distinct economic models are
    there to choose from? Well we can usefully think of economies
    as including <i>ownership relations</i>, production institutions,
    and allocation institutions. If we list the types available
    for each of these components, and check for compatibility problems,
    we can enumerate all existing (and perhaps all possible)
    types of economic models that we might choose from for our
    future. </p>
    <p>Why did I leave out consumption institutions, and put in ownership
    relations? Well, because variations in the former prove in
    practice not to be so critical to the overall character of <i>modern</i> economies
    that we might consider in thinking about an economic vision,
    and therefore not so important for us to highlight in this book,
    whereas variations in the latter, ownership relations, do prove
    to be a particularly critical factor in determining the defining
    character of economies. </p>
    <p>So, what possible choices for institutions do we have? </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Briefly, for ownership relations, any economy can have
        private ownership, state or public ownership, or
        collective ownership, and that's it. That's the whole
        menu of ownership options we have to choose from: four
        options.</i> </p>
        <p><i>For production relations, our visionary economy can
        have hierarchical workplace structure, or formal but
        unimplimented workers' control, or participatory council structure,
        and again, that's it. Three options, broadly speaking,
        are all I know of. (Of course each can have many
        sub-variants, but that is a different issue).</i> </p>
        <p><i>And finally, for allocation relations, our
        visionary economy can have markets, central planning, or
        a combination of the two, complete decentralization, or
        participatory planning. And, ignoring sub-variants, again
        that's it. Four options.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So to figure out all possible economies, we can just ask
    how many combinations there are, remembering that combinations
    which can't hold together because of incompatibilities, have
    to be ruled out. Well the total number of unique combinations
    is 3x3x4 = 36. But it turns out that once we evaluate each of
    these individually things simplify dramatically because many combinations
    just don't work together. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>We can choose variants on Capitalism&#151;which
        have private ownership, hierarchical production relations,
        and markets with more or less government intervention.</i> </p>
        <p><i>Or we can choose variants on (what I call) Coordinatorism (usually
        misleadingly called socialism)&#151;which have collective or
        state ownership, hierarchical production relations or formal but unimplimented
        workers' control, and more or less markets or central
        planning.</i> </p>
        <p><i>Or we can choose variants on a system we might call Decentralized
        Community Economics&#151;which can have any compatible
        combination of the ownership and organizational features,
        but is always organized into in a myriad of small locales
        each of which functions autonomously from the rest, self-sufficiently,
        without allocation relations among them.</i> </p>
        <p><i>Or we can choose variants on Participatory Economics&#151;which has
        proportionate ownership, participatory council
        structures, and participatory planning, and furthers the
        values we seek.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To get more models, someone has to come up with other
    types of institutions or show that some other combination of
    the ones we have already enumerated are viable, it seems to
    me. This is not an apriori impossible task, to be sure. Indeed,
    this book purports to provide the kind of conceptual approach needed to
    do it well. But, for now, finding more options is not on our
    agenda. (Of course, in a real society, economies don't exist
    in the abstract, as models, but only in combination with
    states, kinship spheres, cultures, and so on.). </p>
    <p>And thus arise a few &#147;thought questions&#148;
    preparatory to moving on to lecture 3: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have deduced the possibility 3x3x4 = 36 different conceivable economic
            systems including unique combinations of the
            components. How come we are able to boil this down to
            only four broad economic types? And why aren't there
            more than 36 that are conceivable? Or, can you conceive
            of more? </li>
        <li>Who advocates these different models, and why? </li>
        <li>What are the class relations of each of the four
            models and how do they arise from the basic institutions employed? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Judgments</h2>
    <p>To render judgments on these models is not so difficult as
    it might at first seem. We need only assess their basic institutions
    for implications vis--vis the evaluative standards we
    decided to highlight&#151;equity, solidarity, diversity, and
    self management. If we are going to be disciplined about this,
    as we ought to be, then, if we find that a basic component
    institution is bad on one or more of these counts, we should
    want to reject it from our preferred economic vision. This is
    no different than deciding that amplifiers that use tubes are
    too costly, or receivers without FM are too inflexible, or that
    speakers that don't generate enough volume are insubstantial,
    and ruling these out on such grounds while moving on to
    compose a preferred stereo system from the remaining possible
    components. The logic for economies is essentially the same.
    Rule out economic components that violate our aims. Build a
    workable, desirable economy out of those components that further
    our aims by mixing and matching them into a workable whole
    system. Nothing subtle is at work here. We consider component ownership options,
    production relations options, allocation options, and then we
    have the basis for thinking about economies as a whole. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Ownership Options</h3>
    <p>First, consider <b>private ownership</b>. </p>
    <p>We know, and I am not going to rehearse all the evidence
    and arguments for want of time, that private ownership means
    that capitalists almost exclusively monopolize wealth. But
    this is contrary to equity (whatever precise definition we
    ultimately give it), and to solidarity (haves and have nots
    will not be getting along well), and to self management
    (haves will have more say than have nots), and so we simply
    have to rule it out as a possible component of our economic
    vision. </p>
    <p>Another way of saying it would be to say that we
    immediately reject private ownership on the grounds that
    rather than producing classlessness, it produces class
    division with capitalists on top, and class divisions are incompatible with
    attaining our four evaluative norms. I know that people spend
    lifetimes discussing this, as if there is something
    complicated involved. But there isn't. And since you are
    reading a book on conceptualizing economic vision, I will assume
    you already know this and not waste a whole lot of time on
    the tangential issues, however much fun we might have rehearsing
    them. </p>
    <p>Next, consider state or <b>public ownership</b>. </p>
    <p>Well, we know that under this option the state has
    ultimate control over productive property, either directly or
    as representative of the public. And even though the state
    tells us they will look out for the whole population's interest,
    we know that... </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Even if the state did look out solely for the public
            welfare and even if its caste of bureaucrats were
            rapidly rotated and accountable, state influence would
            still not be self-management but management from the
            top down. </li>
        <li>In fact, if you set aside some group to have major
            powers they will likely develop the means to institutionalize themselves
            and then use their power for their own benefit at the
            cost of society, as in the history of Stalinism, for example.
            Thus there is no equity either. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So it follows that without much ado we can and indeed we
    must reject state or public ownership for our economic goal
    on grounds that it's intrinsic authoritarianism thwarts self
    management and also equity. You may now be thinking to
    yourself, hey, this is too quick, too cavalier, too simple.
    But is it? Really? </p>
    <p>Go back to the example of the stereo. If we establish some
    norms, for example we say that our system has to be able to
    hit some notes, or volume, or whatever, and we assess a
    possible component and by its very structure and definition
    it cannot do what we want, well then, it seems to me we have
    no choice. If we are serious about the norms we established,
    we must reject the component. Surely if this applies for
    stereos, it also applies for economies&#151;more so, if
    anything, since so much more is at stake. </p>
    <p>Next, we can consider <b>collective ownership.</b> </p>
    <p>First, it refers to a situation in which everyone equally
    owns every productive unit&#151;though not peoples' clothes or
    houses, etc. This sounds good, but what does mean? </p>
    <p>If it means that everyone has an equal say in the
    disposition and control of each institution, that would clash
    with participatory self management as we have defined it and
    thus we would have to reject it. In practice, however, this formulation
    of equal say for all in all matters is a bit hard to envision
    in any event... </p>
    <p>If it means no one has any say or any claims by virtue of ownership,
    then this ownership option is essentially neutral, or absent,
    with no decision making or distribution implications at all, thus
    leaving the economy's fate to be decided by other features.
    So we could certainly employ it, with no fanfare but also with
    no loss. It would have no implications for any of the values
    we are pursuing or for anything else, for that matter.
    (Perhaps we should break collective ownership into the two
    options, equal say and no implications for say, but for convenience
    I am only going to treat the second, neutral version. If you
    would like to address the other version, by all means go
    ahead.). </p>
    <p>So, what have we discovered about ownership. We don't like
    and can't abide private ownership or state ownership. We can
    abide collective ownership, at least in its neutral sense
    (though not with any glee as it has neither good nor bad
    implications). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Production Relations Options</h3>
    <p>First, how about <b>hierarchical workplace structure</b>? </p>
    <p>Well, what is it? The idea is simple enough. There is a
    hierarchy of status, power, and rewards associated with jobs,
    and people fit at different levels depending on the job they
    get. Think of a job as a collection of things to do or tasks/responsibilities.
    Different individual tasks and responsibilities (take out the
    trash, deliver the mail, talk to clients, take orders, put
    this ratchet in that slot, design the product, solve
    personnel problems, make policy decisions, or whatever)
    embody different skill and knowledge prerequisites and cause
    the person involved to have to do different things, with
    different effects on the person including different
    implications for the person's status, power, and reward. </p>
    <p>Now for there to be a hierarchy, in practice it is both
    necessary and sufficient that jobs be defined by combining like
    quality tasks/responsibilities with one another into
    relatively homogenous packages. Thus we get janitors, secretaries,
    line workers, managers, engineers, and so on, with jobs that
    are differentially empowering and differentially rewarding in
    circumstances and also remuneration. </p>
    <p>How do we evaluate this option, familiar in nearly every production institution
    in the U.S. and the old Soviet Union and every other
    contemporary economy as well? </p>
    <p>Well, we can see right off that this option offers only
    homogenized jobs (and therefore not much diversity), authoritative
    decision making from the top (by those with more empowering
    work assignments and circumstances), more fulfilling
    conditions and more reward for some actors than others
    (depending on which quality job you get), and a situation
    with those below hostile to those above and vice versa. The
    option scores rather poorly, that is, on all our axes of
    evaluation. </p>
    <p>[Sometimes folks have doubts about the claim that class
    division actually reduces diversity. After all, aren't multiple
    anything more diverse than one of the same thing, so isn't
    having three or four classes bound to be more diverse, whatever
    its other failings, than having classlessness? Well once we
    have classes we have large sectors of people with shared </p>
    <p>interests, arrayed in a hierarchy of reward and power. Now
    a significant part of the existence of each class becomes
    defending its niche, so to speak. This means there are
    powerful pressures causing all members of the class to adopt certain
    postures. </p>
    <p>Is this real, or just rhetoric? </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Well suppose you tell me. Consider music, sports,
    entertainment of other sorts, reading material, eating
    habits, daily life habits, etc. Are there large commonalties
    within classes, and big differences from class to class? Can we
    with some reasonable accuracy (actually often pretty high
    accuracy) predict people's tastes and preferences, values and
    views, in diverse domains of life, merely knowing their class
    affiliation? Of course other factors are at play as well,
    including, in the economy, markets, say, but just plain old class
    seems to me to have this impact of constraining and delimiting
    the options of people in ways that limit and homogenize outcomes,
    thus stemming diversity.] </p>
    <p>In any event, even without a lot of detailed analysis
    (which, however, is very worthwhile to do if you have the time
    for it) we can immediately reject hierarchical workplace
    structure as not fit for our economic vision since it fosters
    class stratification&#151;workers at the bottom and then
    coordinators, or then coordinators and capitalists depending
    on the type of economy&#151;which is inconsistent with equity,
    self management, solidarity, and even diversity. </p>
    <p>The second option for production relations we have called <b>formal but unimplimented
    workers' control.</b> </p>
    <p>The thing I have in mind here is a system that has in fact
    existed, for example in Yugoslavia. In each workplace there
    is a council of all the workers which has full authority over
    all decisions. The workers, organized into councils, have
    ultimate authority. However, we also know that that these councils choose,
    for reasons we'll understand after talking about allocation,
    to have homogenized jobs and to hire managers and plant
    bosses to rule over work, so the actual result is a
    hierarchical workplace structure. </p>
    <p>Therefore, despite its formal pluses, in that worker's
    power is at least formally recognized, we reject formal but unimplimented workers'
    control for the same reason as we reject hierarchical workplace structure,
    because in practice it is a coordinator ruled workplace
    obstructing the values we favor. The origin of the hierarchy
    is not an imposition from the defined production relations,
    but an imposition from the allocation system on each workplace. Nonetheless
    in Yugoslavia with formal but unimplimented workers' control, the
    structure of roles in each workplace was only marginally distinguishable in
    practice from what exists at a U.S. Ford or a Soviet Latka factory. </p>
    <p>So what about <b>balanced job complexes</b>? </p>
    <p>We will of course spend considerable time on this option,
    later. For now, briefly, the idea is that we combine tasks/responsibilities
    into jobs so that each job is comparable to all others for
    quality of work experience, status, and particularly for
    empowerment implications even though each has its own particular
    combination of tasks and responsibilities. And, likewise, we incorporate
    an array of workplace councils to facilitate participatory proportionate
    decision making. </p>
    <p>Balanced job complexes means that: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Every individual regularly does both conception and execution
            in a balanced combination so that she or he is prepared
            to participate effectively in decision-making; . </li>
        <li>No individual long occupies positions that present
            unusual opportunities to monopolize influence, knowledge,
            or skills relevant to general decision-making; and . </li>
        <li>There is an equal distribution of the costs and
            benefits of work. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And nested council democracy means...proportionate decision-making
    and a sensible approach to meetings and time in general. </p>
    <p>So, assuming we can fill it out and substantiate our
    claims for it, balanced job complexes will be a worthy structural
    choice for production (and also consumption) because it is by
    its very definition and by the dynamics it imposes fully
    self-managed, capable of diversity, equitable in job assignments, and
    compatible with material equity and solidarity, assuming, that
    is, that we can also build those features into allocation. </p>
    <p>Balanced job complexes are, moreover, a classless
    choice&#151;with no difference in power/reward and no class difference
    among actors in workplaces&#151;and it therefore a good one
    for our new economic vision, again, supposing we can make it
    work in its own right, and along with viable, compatible allocation
    institutions. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Allocation</h3>
    <p>First we ought to consider markets, though to deal with
    this matter in any kind of detail would tax available time and
    energy. What do we mean by markets? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>That all goods, including labor are bought and sold
            for prices set competitively. </li>
        <li>That each actor tries to maximize his or her own gain
            and that no actor can advance without it being at the competitive expense
            of some other actor. </li>
        <li>That decisions are all made in light of immediate
            effects on personal well being for consumers and institutional
            profit for producers&#151;since to do otherwise is to
            suffer unnecessarily as a consumer or risk being competed
            right out of business as a producer. </li>
        <li>That since workplace decisions are purely technical,
            seeking to maximize revenues minus costs, and do not take
            account of the social needs of workers or of the
            community or even of consumers, they are best left to administrators.
            (In other words, even if workers have power, they
            will cede it to a class of coordinators, as in
            Yugoslavia, via what we have called formal but
            unimplimented workers control, rather than preside over decisions
            to oppress themselves.). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moreover, we know both by our ability to analyze their
    intrinsic dynamics and by looking at history that as a result
    of the operations of markets, a market economy inevitably
    has: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Commodity fetishism&#151;wherein decisions account
            for prices of things but take little account of social relations
            between people. </li>
        <li>Antagonistic roles&#151;wherein I get ahead at your
            loss and solidarity is destroyed. </li>
        <li>Anti-social bias&#151;wherein goods are inevitably
            mispriced such that those which benefit groups are
            under valued and thereby under produced, while those
            that help individuals but at a cost to non-buyers are
            over valued and thereby over produced, all leading to
            an anti-social pattern of production and investment
            and an ensuing personality development that is individualist
            in the narrowest sense. </li>
        <li>Workplace hierarchy&#151;wherein a coordinator class
            or perhaps a coordinator class and a capitalist class dominate workers. </li>
        <li>And ecological decay&#151;wherein resources are
            undervalued, pollution and other environmental degradation is
            minimized, long term effects are left out of
            decisions, and of course independent ecological
            criteria can never be taken into account unless they
            are consistent with simple profit-maximization. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Though there are other problems as well, on any of these
    grounds, which sound abstract when presented so succinctly
    but yield the kind of depravity we see throughout our
    society&#151;poverty, profit-seeking, homelessness, greed, anti-social
    individuality, unemployment, a few percent of all people
    owning grossly disproportionate wealth, ecological disasters,
    and so on, and which obviously conflict with all four of our
    guiding evaluative criteria&#151;we can reject markets as an
    allocation system for our visionary economy. </p>
    <p>And now we have some thought questions, based on the discussion
    to this point. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain structurally how markets impact on people's personalities
            and preferences? </li>
        <li>Do markets deliver what we want, or do we want what markets
            deliver, and what difference does it make? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Next, we need to consider <b>central planning</b>. Well,
    right off we know that. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Central planning is a system whereby planners (coordinators)
            in some sort of central planning board determine
            prices and amounts to be produced in accord with a
            socially decided set of criteria, or, more often, their
            own whim and interests. </li>
        <li>And that under central planning, in order that the
            workplaces can be dealt with by the planners and to
            have someone accountable in each, the planners extend
            themselves out into the workplaces as a layer of managers, engineers,
            etc.&#151;the rest of the coordinator class. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>And we also know that as a result of the operations of
    central planning, a centrally planned economy inevitably has: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>authoritarianism&#151;wherein down go orders, up
            comes clarification of potentials, down go new orders,
            and up comes obedience. </li>
        <li>alienation&#151;wherein, as with markets, there is no
            way for anyone to account for anyone else's social circumstances, only
            prices are available for judgment. </li>
        <li>not self-management in proportion to
            effect&#151;since even if the planners used a vote to
            set the criteria by which they plan, at best that's
            one person one vote which is a far cry from my having more
            say in what effects me more and less in what effects
            you more. </li>
        <li>Investment to enhance coordinator power and
            wealth&#151;with an emphasis on centralism, large-scale,
            and high tech&#151;regardless of effects on others and
            on the ecology. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again it sounds pretty abstract, but in practice it is the
    disastrous dynamics we saw in the Soviet and other Eastern
    Bloc economies, and so, I think we can reject central
    planning too. </p>
    <p>So what about <b>complete decentralization</b> and no
    allocation among separate locales? </p>
    <p>For now, let's leave this one as an exercise. How do we
    evaluate it? Each region is separate and self sufficient. Economic
    relations are deduced to community barter, with no
    significant allocation system to speak of. How does it
    measure up by our values? Equity, Solidarity, Self
    Management, and delivering the goods efficiently. </p>
    <p>What's left is <b>Participatory Planning.</b> </p>
    <p>We are of course going to spend considerable time conceptualizing
    this last allocation option later in the lectures, but, for
    the sake of completeness, and with comparable brevity, we know
    that it embodies. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A network of nested councils for consumption and production
            units, industries, neighborhoods, regions, etc. </li>
        <li>Facilitation boards to assist in data handling. </li>
        <li>Qualitative information and prices that reveal the
            true social costs and benefits of alternative choices. </li>
        <li>Remuneration according to effort which, along with
            balanced job complexes insures comparable consumption
            bundles and material conditions. </li>
        <li>A generalized and ultimate interest in the societal
            pie and improved average work conditions even beyond one's
            local circumstances. </li>
        <li>And an iterated planning procedure in which units communicate
            their desires back and forth for a number of rounds
            of revision arriving at an agreed social plan. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In participatory planning workers and consumers express
    their desires, efficiently modify them in light of ever fuller
    information concerning their implications for others, and
    finally, democratically settle on an equitable plan. </p>
    <p>Social interaction permits all actors to evaluate the full
    social burdens and benefits of their own and other people's
    proposals. </p>
    <p>Consumption and work equilibrate as consumers discover
    whose requests require more than average social sacrifice,
    and workers discover who is proposing to shoulder less than
    average social burdens. </p>
    <p>Each participant influences decisions in proportion as he
    or she is affected by them. </p>
    <p>Allocation involves a new social, iterative procedure that
    differs fundamentally from central planning and markets. </p>
    <p>Each council assesses past experience and an accumulated
    record of prior planning to estimate the kinds of efforts others
    would have to expend to provide a proposed list of inputs,
    and the uses to which others could put a proposed list of
    outputs, and then makes its own initial proposal. </p>
    <p>After seeing all initial proposals, each council gets new information
    about the human effects for others of different options. New
    estimates of the social values of goods in turn facilitate revising requests
    until a workable plan is achieved. </p>
    <p>In a nutshell, the procedure whittles down from an
    incompatible set of optimal desires to a mutually compatible group
    of economic choices in two ways. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pressure is brought to bear on consumers requesting
            more than others and on producers proposing to work less
            than others to make their proposals more equitable. </li>
        <li>Revisions of the valuations of goods induce actors to
            shift away from using scarce resources and goods burdensome
            to produce toward using more plentiful resources and
            goods less burdensome to produce. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both kinds of whittling move us from incompatible to
    compatible proposals. The first kind promotes equitable outcomes
    and the second promotes social efficiency. </p>
    <p>Some questions arise:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the above is an account of participatory planning,
            what might be our evaluation of it by our criteria&#151;or what questions
            about it do we need to answer (design) to evaluate it? </li>
        <li>How do we evaluate capitalism as we know it in the
            U.S. </li>
        <li>What about social democracy (and what is it, compared
            to the U.S. economy). </li>
        <li>What about a market, state ownership, formal
            workplace democracy system (sometime, wrongly, called market socialism,
            more aptly called market Coordinatorism, I think). </li>
        <li>What about a centrally planned, state ownership,
            hierarchical workplace, Soviet style economy (or what
            I call Centrally Planned Coordinatorism)? </li>
        <li>What about a Green decentralized economy? </li>
        <li>And why might we have hope for something better than
            the above options? </li>
    </ul>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this chapter we are going to try to refine our general
    values into a set of more precise requirements for production
    relations and workplaces generally. First, however, here my
    answers to the questions raised last lecture. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 2 Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beyond some vague notion of equity what should be the actual
            criteria of remuneration and disposition of economic responsibilities? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, this was a thought question, the answer to which
    doesn't arise in lectures until later. Possibilities would be that
    we should remunerate for property held, productive output,
    the value of one's contribution, prior education, skills, effort,
    sacrifice, or need. Choosing among these depends in part on
    one's aims, of course, but also on a clear understanding of
    the implications of each for the values we hold dear. You
    might want to think about this, preparatory to future discussions. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We have deduced the possibility 3x3x4 = 36 different conceivable economic
            systems including unique combinations of the
            components. How come we are able to boil this down to
            only four broad economic types? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because most of the combinations are not viable. The idea
    is simple enough. If we are putting together a stereo system
    from components, each has to have requirements and
    implications compatible with the context established by or the
    conditions needed by other components. We can't have speakers
    that require a whole lot of power, and am amp that gives off
    very little power, for example. </p>
    <p>Well, it is similar in an economy. For example, you cannot
    have markets or central planning and non-hierarchical work
    places because these allocation systems impose hierarchy on
    workplaces and don't operate properly in its absence. This is
    most of the answer, the rest is that I cheated. That is, I left
    out some conceivable options. For example, private ownership
    plus central planning by the state (generally called a <i>fascist</i>
    economy) was left out. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who advocates these different models, and why? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Beyond academics playing games, people advocate visions because
    they want the outcomes those visions promise to deliver. Those
    who will wind up owning (or who already own) the means of production
    will most aggressively advocate capitalism. They will also
    try to convince others of its value (by hook or crook). </p>
    <p>Those who will wind up (or already are) coordinators will
    most aggressively advocate coordinator economic systems
    (usually called, misleadingly, to entice other supporters,
    &#147;market socialism&#148; or &#147;centrally planned socialism&#148;). </p>
    <p>Politically identified elites (fascists and Stalinists)
    will prefer variants on capitalism or coordinatorism in which a
    one party state runs the show by monopolizing planning posts
    and the government. </p>
    <p>Ultimately, I would argue, working people will most
    aggressively advocate participatory economics, it being a system
    that elevates them to optimal status (as the only economic
    actors and thus the dominant ones, as well). </p>
    <p>This is all, of course, a bit oversimplified, as one may
    prefer the least evil, having ruled out the best option as impossible:
    the excuse given by many who profess left values but advocate
    market coordinatorism, despite its many failings. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the class relations of each of the four
            models and how do they arise from the basic institutions employed? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ownership relations and hierarchical production
    relations of capitalism generate a three tiered class
    structure of capitalists (owning the means of production),
    coordinators (monopolizing knowledge and skills and job slots prerequisite
    to control over not only their own economic circumstances,
    but those of others lacking these claims), and workers (who
    simply sell their ability to do work for a wage and follow
    out orders given by others, carving out the best existence
    possible by organizing to increase their bargaining power). </p>
    <p>With the private ownership of capital eliminated in the
    post capitalist societies I call coordinatorist, the remaining
    allocation and production relations demarcate two classes,
    coordinators and workers, and elevate the former to dominance
    over the latter. </p>
    <p>In participatory economics, or parecon for short, there is
    no class distinction generated by ownership, production, or
    allocation relations (not consumption either), and, on the
    contrary, these aspects of economic life all generate classless
    dynamics. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain structurally how markets impact on people's personalities
            and preferences? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a big and a bit unfair question. </p>
    <p>Briefly, markets compel us to consider our own well being
    and ignore (as well as be ignorant of) the well being of
    those who produce what we consume or consume what we produce.
    We must compete. We will try to fulfill ourselves in
    consumption and due to the biased pricing of products under market allocation&#151;those that
    are private will be under-priced and those that are public
    will be over-priced. We will, in reaction, bend ourselves to
    prefer the former. </p>
    <p>Instead of markets delivering what people want, therefore,
    people come to want what markets deliver. Thus our beings
    follow a trajectory of preference development that arises
    outside ourselves in the dynamics of markets and the reproduction
    of the conditions of profit of the few. We become self-centered and
    egocentric due to market impositions, rather than markets
    delivering every more egocentric and self-centered products
    because the drive for these is built into our beings. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do markets deliver what we want, or do we want what markets
            deliver, and what difference does it make? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the first case markets would be a kind of neutral
    conveyor belt of economic life letting us manifest our preferences
    freely. We, our beings and preferences, would be determinant.
    In the second case, regardless of who we are and what we
    might want in the most free conditions, markets will contour us
    in predictable ways. In other words markets affect us,
    causing us to evolve preferences for what markets are biased
    to deliver to us. These results are aggravated when markets
    are combined with private ownership, but they exist even when
    property is socialized, but markets are retained. </p>
    <p>To understand it, think in terms of someone being
    deposited in prison and developing (sensibly) a taste for
    what the prison commissary has to offer&#151;though, if the
    same person were outside the prison, he or she would dismiss all
    the offerings as horrible, not distinguishing among them. The prisoner reconstructs
    his/her preferences so as to be able to get the best out of what
    is available. Notice then that what is made available is
    critical to the prisoners evolving preferences, as are the
    prices attached. If some things are under priced and others
    over priced relative to their true worth, we incline toward
    developing preferences for the former and away from the
    latter. </p>
    <p>Markets do not just make any old thing available, and only
    at correct prices. Rather they impose biases into what is
    provided and at what prices, and we then operate in context
    of these biases (just as the prisoner operates in context of
    the biased/limited offerings of the commissary) and the
    result is that we learn to like what is available, rather
    than what is available coming into accord with what we freely
    want. This is the difference between freedom and alienation. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What about complete decentralization and no
            allocation among separate regions. How do we evaluate
            it? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I suppose we could argue about this. Many people do. But
    to me, to be blunt, it is an idiotic notion. Not that there isn't
    a kernel of wisdom in it. Sure, face to face relations are
    sometimes preferable to larger scale arrangements. And if we
    make these face-to face structures democratic and
    participatory, that's all the better. But small is good is
    not some kind of unbridgeable principle. It will be valid when
    it is the better way to attain aims like justice, equity,
    solidarity, diversity, ecological balance, efficient use of
    productive assets, and so on. But when it doesn't better
    propel these ends, then it is a bad choice. Elaborated into an
    entire economic vision&#151;little self-sufficient communities acting
    in isolation from one another&#151;it means either gargantuan redundancy
    of effort and huge inefficiencies, waste, and ecological
    harm; or extreme deprivation. It also means, inevitably, gross
    inequality between regions that have different local assets (and
    to redress this by allocation, is to argue for a different model). </p>
    <p>It seems also to curtail diversity and variety, to even be inconsistent
    with the idea of universal entwinement (which it tries to
    sunder) that is generally typical of ecological thought. </p>
    <p>What is sought in this vision, ecological balance,
    participation, no alienation, etc., is not, in fact, attained.
    So why people advocate the view is a bit of a mystery to me.
    It seems almost like an intellectual fetish, incompletely thought out. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the above (in the lecture) is an account of
            participatory planning, what might be our evaluation of
            it by our criteria&#151;what questions about it do we
            need to answer (design) to evaluate it? </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It seems to me that if the brief description I offered in
    our multi-economy discussion was valid, then we would know
    that Parecon fulfilled the values we set out for a visionary
    economy. The questions, of course, are can it actually work?
    What are the details? Why won't it just collapse in chaos or stasis,
    etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do we evaluate capitalism as we know it in the
            U.S.? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is, by our criteria of judgment, a dung heap. It
    destroys solidarity, creates inequity unparalleled in history,
    gives some people almost unlimited power over outcomes while
    denying most people even marginal say over their own economic
    circumstances, and it even distorts personalities and preferences
    in such ways as to homogenize outcomes and reduce diversity.
    The fact that most academics would be horrified by my
    terminology&#151;&#147;it is a dung heap&#148;&#151;is no testament
    to their civility or integrity. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What about social democracy (and what is it, compared
            to the U.S. economy)? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Social Democracy is capitalism with a more powerful
    working class (and coordinator class) and a weaker capitalist
    class. It is, as a result, better, with a variety of reform
    structures incorporated to ameliorate and even, in some instances,
    redress problems arising from the underlying capitalist structure.
    It is a quite unstable economic structure, however, as a
    shift in balance of economic power can quickly cause
    reversion to more aggressive capitalist dynamics. The
    structure is capitalism, but the balance of power between
    class is less favorable to those at the top. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>And why might we have hope for something better than
            the above options? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Either because we have thought long and hard on the issues
    and decided that some alternative arrangement has much better qualities
    and is possible, or because we have no compelling answers of that
    type but we realize that without hope for something better,
    we will only get worse. This latter, I suppose, is a kind of
    religious belief and historically it is not so easy to say which
    type of hope serves a progressive movement better... I myself
    think having both at once is a nice combination. </p>
    <p>And, now, on to the new material for lecture 3. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Production Values</h2>
    <p>So, what norms do we want to have guide our design of workplace relationships?
    Well, we know from the prior discussions we have had that my answer
    is equity (of material and circumstances), solidarity,
    diversity, and participatory self management, plus efficiency
    (in the sense of attaining desired outcomes with as little
    waste as possible). But what does this set of aims translate
    into in a workplace environment? What, more specifically and precisely,
    are our goals for workplace life? </p>
    <p>I want to point out, as a kind of sidebar, that you should
    see the methodology at work here. It's obvious and easy, once
    one gets into it. If you want to follow along using other
    values that you prefer to those I am using in the lectures,
    by all means do so. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Establish general values. Apply them in specific contexts
        to get more refined and specific goals. Then move on (in
        later lectures) to actually designing systems to attain the
        goals. Be sure your choices are compatible, from one
        domain of the economy to another.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>A workplace involves tasks that need to be done and
    decisions that need to be made. There will be a host of roles people
    fill which is what makes it an institution, in my view. And
    so, the question becomes, what goals do we have for those
    roles (in light of the need to get work done and decisions made)
    to meet our overarching aims of equity, solidarity,
    diversity, and self-management, plus minimizing waste (of
    things we care about)? </p>
    <p>So let's take each value in turn, and assess its broad
    implications for production relations. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Equity</h2>
    <p>Equity, remember, doesn't mean a fair race, in our usage.
    Instead it refers to fair outcomes. So what does it say to us
    about workplace role structures, for example? </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Somehow, it must be that in each workplace what people
        do is fairly apportioned. What you do, and what I do has
        to be seen as fair, by our standards, in every workers' eyes.
        More, this is true if we are in the same work team in a
        workplace, if we are in the same workplace but don't have
        the same responsibilities, and even if we are in different workplaces,
        across town from one another, or in San Francisco, on the
        one hand, and Charlotte, on the other.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Well, the possibilities for role defining would seem to
    be&#133; </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Apportion responsibilities so we all do the same
            exact things as one another at work under the same
            exact conditions. </li>
        <li>Apportion responsibilities so we all work the same
            length of time, but we do whatever we are best at. </li>
        <li>Let everyone do whatever they want, for however long
            they want to do it. </li>
        <li>Let everyone judge the available options and
            negotiate with one another for who does what, and then
            work the same amount of time as one another. </li>
        <li>Divide up stuff into jobs all of whose
            responsibilities require some fixed level of
            background or skill and maximally utilize it, and
            then have people compete for who gets what jobs, but
            have all work the same length day. </li>
        <li>Do either of the prior 3 options, but juggle the time
            required at work to offset any differences in job
            quality by requiring extra or less time on the job
            depending as one's work situation is better or worse. </li>
        <li>Apportion tasks into jobs that are comparable in
            their quality of life impact, and let everyone then
            negotiate for who gets to have which jobs, all worked
            the same length of time per day. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And, perhaps, you can think of some other options as well. </p>
    <p>And the thought questions that arise are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do we rate these options (and any others you wish
            to add) if we are taking into account only equity? Which
            options are equitable, and which aren't? And why.
            Remember, we are only talking about equity, at this point. </li>
        <li>Refine our equity aim, regarding
            workplaces/production... </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Solidarity</h2>
    <p>A condition of solidarity&#151;we will define&#151;is that
    people care about each other's well being and assess their own
    actions in part in light of the effects on others. Optimally,
    in includes a high degree of empathy. </p>
    <p>So, again, we have the problem of figuring out what kind
    of relations among actors, what kind of apportionment of tasks among
    them, and what kind of distribution of decision making power
    are consistent with promoting solidarity, and what kinds are
    contrary to promoting solidarity? </p>
    <p>Before you get irritated about my lecture approach to
    piling on these questions, please remember this is a book about conceptualizing
    new economic models...not about learning a particular one or
    merely hearing an argument in favor of this or that
    perspective. If you don't try to do some conceptualizing, well, you
    aren't going to get as much out of the lectures. And, anyhow,
    I will also provide answers, all in good time. So: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Think in terms of roles, as in the above list under
            the equity issue, but also think in terms of distribution
            of decision making power and actual interactions
            among actors, and try to enunciate a variety of
            options, and their merits and debits vis--vis
            solidarity, and, for the purposes of this question, only
            solidarity. </li>
        <li>Refine our aim for solidarity into workplace aims. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Diversity</h2>
    <p>Diversity is simply a condition of many outcomes, many approaches
    to accomplishing ends, many variants and circumstances which
    one can either choose among, at different times, or benefit vicariously
    from, via the different effects on others, seeing others in
    different forms of action, etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>With the earlier listed 7 forms of workplace
            organization, and any others you might care to evaluate, consider
            the implications for diversity of outcomes. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Participatory Self-management</h2>
    <p>Well we have already refined this into a notion that
    immediately translates to production and the workplace. We want
    each actor to have a say in outcomes proportionate to the
    effects the outcomes have on that actor. Can we translate this
    more, in light of the details of the workplace context? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does our self-management aim tell us about one
            person one vote in the work place? Think about some decisions
            and whether it makes sense that everyone have equal
            say, everyone vote, etc. </li>
        <li>What does it tell us about power being vested in the
            hands of only a subset of the employees? </li>
        <li>What does it tell us about limits on the worker's
            impact on decisions&#151;vis--vis community residents, consumers,
            etc.? </li>
        <li>Finally, if you can rule out some options for
            workplace organization in light of our self management
            aim, can you also say anything positive or prescriptive
            about what we might incorporate into workplace
            decision making to meet this aim? Either institutions
            or methods? </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Remember, the idea of efficiency is that we don't want to
    set a goal for the actions of a workplace and then meet that
    goal, but in a way that wastes things we care about in the
    process (time, materials of value, energy, whatever). </p>
    <p>On the other hand, efficiency does not mean that the only
    thing that matters is quantities we can enumerate on some scale
    of measurement. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>So what does the efficiency aim tell us about meeting
            all the others that we also have? Do any of your
            ideas about the implications of the other values for
            workplace organization and institutions and
            decision-making come into conflict with the desire to
            avoid needless waste? Do they facilitate efficiency
            in the best sense of the term? </li>
    </ul>

1: Consumption Values</i> </font></h3>

<hr>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this chapter we do for consumption what we did for
    production last chapter: move from our general encompassing
    values to more precise evaluative norms and aims for
    consumption per se. First, however, here are answers to the questions
    raised last lecture. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 3 Questions</h2>
    <p>The topic of lecture 3, remember, was production values
    and we began by discussing the norms we want to have guide
    our design of workplace relationships. We started with equity
    (of material and circumstances), solidarity, diversity, and
    participatory self management, plus efficiency (in the sense of
    attaining desired outcomes with as little waste as possible)
    and we tried to move from these broad aims to more specific
    aims for workplaces. </p>
    <p>To do this we listed seven ways of dividing up tasks in
    the workplace. And I requested that you evaluate these from
    the perspective of our values. Here are my brief responses,
    then... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apportion responsibilities so we all do the same
            exact things as one another at work under the same
            exact conditions. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the abstract, I guess I would say this is pretty
    equitable. Everyone gets the same circumstances. Likewise
    there is no hierarchy, though I am not sure how decisions
    would be made. I don't know whether there is a solidarity of misery or
    not. There is no diversity. </p>
    <p>In practice, it is of course absurd. (Nothing says my
    questions have to be sensible.) First, there is no such thing
    as allotting work to that each thing to be done is divided
    into identical tasks for all people in the workplace. But even ignoring
    problems like that, the other difficulty is that while
    abstractly equitable the option pays no attention to the
    unique interests, desires, and potentials of the actors. I guess
    someone might like the peculiar combination of things they
    would have to do, but most people wouldn't, to differing degrees.
    Anyhow, this is really pretty stupid... It is equitable, in a
    sense, but horribly inefficient due to misutilizing everyone's
    unique capacities, and so on. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apportion responsibilities so we all work the same
            length of time, but we do whatever we are best at. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The idea here is supposed to be that the only things that
    matter are (a) how long we work, and (b) how much we produce. </p>
    <p>How long matters, in this view, because we all so
    uniformly and completely dislike work that doing one thing or another
    makes little difference. The only thing that matters to us is
    when we get off. </p>
    <p>How much we produce matters, however, because our boss
    wants profits, or society wants more output, or whatever. </p>
    <p>As to being equitable, assuming that with this option we
    actually wind up doing only what we are best at, unless the
    claim about everyone hating all work equally is correct,
    equity disappears. One person is best at something pleasant,
    another person happens to excel at something quite onerous. Likewise
    for some having more power, some less, precluding self management
    and solidarity. There could be variety, however. </p>
    <p>Also this option is impossible for reasons like those that
    apply to number one, but that is beside the point. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let everyone do whatever they want, for however long
            they want to do it. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This option is strange to evaluate on equity grounds. If
    we are all doing precisely what we want, to the degree we want,
    it is hard to see how we could call it inequitable. After
    all, you couldn't change its equity characteristics, or any
    other characteristics, without forcing someone to make a
    choice other than they wished to. </p>
    <p>Seems obvious, doesn't it? </p>
    <p>However, a problem arises. </p>
    <p>What jobs do people choose from? We have fudged the issue
    by not commenting on this in the definition. We can't each do whatever
    we want, or there will be no output because what you want, what
    I want, and what she and he want may not match. If I want to
    go left on the assembly line and you want to go right, or I want
    to do one sequence for some function, and you want a different
    sequence, we get a mess. So presumably this option comes down
    to meaning from among the available job options, we each do
    what we want. Well, nice, but what if we all want one option,
    and not any other? So it might mean from among all the options,
    subject to the constraint that things get done, we each pick what
    we want. Well, fine, but when our choices won't get stuff done,
    who changes? And, most important and least often addressed,
    who (or what) sets up the options to choose among in the
    first place? Let me repeat that: who (or what) sets up the options
    to choose among in the first place? </p>
    <p>Without more detail this seemingly ideal option may not be equitable, certainly
    has said nothing about self management (even though it seems
    to emphasize that), will be diverse, however, and if it fails
    on any other counts, won't be solidaritous. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Let everyone judge the available options and
            negotiate with one another for who does what, and then
            work the same amount of time as one another. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not too bad, at first glance. But again, we have this
    problem of where the options that we negotiate among came from.
    If they are very unequal, then however we decide to divide
    them up, someone gets a raw deal and equity is gone. More, if
    we didn't set them, then we aren't self managing. If they
    aren't unequal, and we did decide the options, well, then we
    may be unto something... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Divide up stuff into jobs all of whose
            responsibilities require some fixed level of
            background or skill and maximally utilize it, and
            then have people compete for who gets what jobs, but
            have all work the same length day. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what, in fact, advocates of market post capitalist economies
    advocate, I believe. The market induces this type of job
    structure, and this type of competition. The outcome is inequitable
    by virtue of different people enjoying or suffering differential
    quality of life at work...and is obviously also anti solidaritous
    as people compete, etc., and fails to have self management,
    for many, anyhow, as some jobs will command and others obey. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do either of the prior 3 options, but juggle the time
            required at work to offset any differences in job
            quality by requiring extra or less time on the job
            depending as one's work situation is better or worse. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we are talking simply equity, I think this is hard to
    criticize. Thus, I say I will do the harder, more onerous
    job, but I want more pay for it, or to work less hours for
    the same income. The idea is that we balance not just quality of life
    at work, but the sum of quality of life at work and quality
    of life in consumption. If the former is lower, we reward
    more income so the latter can make up for it. This option is
    not to be sneered at, I think, so long as we are only talking
    equity. Notice, it means the person in the pleasant or
    uplifting job gets less pay than the person in the dangerous
    or boring one. </p>
    <p>And this option certainly allows diversity and doesn't
    have to preclude solidarity either, it would seem. But on self-management it
    likely fails. For if people are choosing among options that
    have widely differing empowerment effects, then even if we
    balance for quality of life by rewarding those who take the
    worse jobs with more income, the differential impact on
    people's abilities to participate in decisions, on their
    knowledge and skills, and so on, will mean a divergence from
    self management. A group will rise to positions of dominance
    in decision making, and then, in time, will decide to redesign
    the remuneration scheme in its own interest. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apportion tasks into jobs that are comparable in
            their quality of life impact, and let everyone then
            negotiate for who gets to have which jobs, all worked
            the same length of time per day. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This seems rather equitable. By the way we define the
    jobs, the outcomes are equitable. By the way we choose jobs,
    we preserve diversity and allow for the possibility of self
    management. Absent inequality and competition, solidarity is
    possible. </p>
    <p>We can also be flexible on the hours, rewarding more or
    less income as one chooses to work more or less hours. I also
    asked you to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Refine our aim for solidarity into workplace aims. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What does this mean? </p>
    <p>Well, we say we want the economy to promote solidarity.
    So, what does that mean in a workplace? What conditions
    promote solidarity? It seems to me that the answer to this is
    that we need a workplace organization and process which gives
    each worker empathy for the situation of others, gives each
    an interest in all others having as good a situation as
    oneself, gives all the workers an interest in innovation that
    doesn't pit different groups against one another, and so on. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>This idea is simple enough, once enunciated. An economic institution
        promotes solidarity to the extent that it gives people interests
        that are compatible, or mutually supportive, or even identical. You
        get ahead, I get ahead, and vice versa. Also, to the extent
        the structures give each worker a sense of what others
        do, and a respect for their contribution, this too will augment
        solidarity.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here's something to think about. Suppose in my workplace
    we are deciding between two possible innovations&#151;one
    effects the quality of life in the foundry, the other effects
    it in the promotion department. What is the solidaritous
    dynamic, and the anti-solidaritous dynamic for resolving this choice? </p>
    <p>We said in lecture 3, also, that we want each actor to
    have a say in outcomes proportionate to the effects the outcomes
    have on that actor. </p>
    <p>And I asked: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does our self-management aim tell us about
            one-person one-vote in the work place? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It tells us it is nonsense. We don't have each person vote
    equally on when I will go to the bathroom, or whether you
    will put your phone on the right hand or the left hand side
    of your desk. Why? Because these decisions don't impact everyone
    to the same extent, nor do all but a very few decisions, in
    fact, which is what one person one vote does. Assessing this
    is as easy as pie. We eliminate on option for decision making
    as incompatible with our goal. The hard part is to see this,
    to register it, and to then abide it, not continually glancing
    back and saying, okay, let's decide by a one person one vote
    ballot. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does it tell us about power being vested in the
            hands of only a subset of the employees? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is obviously ruled out as well. If a subset of
    workers have power, then unless one believes decisions impact only
    on them, one has abrogated the goal of each actor having a
    say in decisions proportionate to the effect of the decisions
    on them. Obviously it isn't only a few people in the workplace
    who are affected by decisions about how everyone works, with
    what tools, at what pace, making what products, and so on.
    So, another option is gone. Not maybe gone. Not reduced in
    its merit. Simply eliminated. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>What does it tell us about limits on the worker's
            impact on decisions&#151;vis--vis community residents, consumers,
            etc.? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, if people in neighborhoods, or consumers wherever
    they may be are also to have proportionate say in decisions
    depending on the extent they are affected by them, clearly
    they will have to have input, by one means or another, in
    many decisions about the workplace. To rule them out is
    itself ruled out by our goal. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finally, I also asked, if you can rule out some
            options for workplace organization in light of our self management
            aim, can you also say anything positive or
            prescriptive about what we might incorporate into workplace
            decision making to meet this aim? Either institutions
            or methods? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will answer this from my perspective later. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I also asked, however, what does the efficiency aim
            tell us about meeting all the others that we also
            have? Do any of your ideas about the implications of
            the other values for workplace organization and institutions and
            decision-making come into conflict with the desire to avoid needless
            waste? Do they facilitate efficiency in the best
            sense of the term? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The answer here is also simple. It depends on what we mean
    by efficiency. If we mean maximizing output while minimizing (monetary)
    cost, that is one thing, and it will conflict with many of our
    other aims. But if we mean attaining the aims we seek with minimum
    waste of anything we care about&#151;which is what we ought
    to mean&#151;then it is merely a shorthand way of evaluating
    our attainment of all our other values. </p>
    <p>One of the major achievements of bourgeois propaganda has
    been to establish the idea that economics is about quantities
    and particularly profits&#151;thus the strange and horrible
    meaning given to the term efficiency. If, instead, we say economics
    is about meeting people's needs and developing their potentials, then,
    of course, we get a very different definition of efficiency.
    Efficient for one goal, an economy will be inefficient for
    many others. </p>
    <p>There is another way to understand this strangeness about
    the economics profession. Imagine, for a moment, that we
    create a scholastic department in universities throughout the
    country whose purpose is to comprehend and teach about
    procreation. Now imagine that these departments developed an extensive
    toolbox of concepts and analyses for the purpose, and that
    these made no reference to the human well being and
    development of mothers or children. Instead, they focus only
    on, say, the amount of oxygen or other nutrients used during
    the birthing process, etc. This would surely be strange. Or
    imagine a scholastic study of medicine which paid lots of
    attention to the techniques, the biological theories, the
    buildings and tools, but said almost nothing about the effect
    of medicine on sick people. While not exactly analogous to the
    economics profession, these failings are similar to studying economics
    without concepts that focus on the effect of economic structures
    and choices on economic actors, particularly workers. And so
    it is that the word efficiency comes to have no connection whatever
    to the human implications of economic activity&#151;save in the
    sense that maximizing profits itself has, of course, many
    human implications. </p>
    <p>Well, time to move on to the new content for lecture 4. </p>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Consumption Values</h2>
    <p>Consumption is not something I think it makes sense to
    beat to death. We do it for our own reasons. To enjoy, learn,
    whatever. And the economist isn't supposed to try to second
    guess that. We need to remove biases built into the economic
    structures that distort or otherwise constrain our
    preferences, and we need to be sure that the value of what
    each person is free to consume is such that the overall impact
    is to promote our favored values. In this lecture we seek to
    refine our goals, this time for consumption, beyond the very
    general aims of equity, self management, solidarity,
    diversity, and (we now understand, a summary of all the
    others) efficiency. </p>
    <p>So the real focus for this discussion needs to be <i>income</i>,
    or how much we deserve to consume; what we as consumers need
    to have in order to be able to do our consuming&#151;however
    much it is&#151;responsibly; and how much control we should
    have over what we get. How much does each person get to have
    out of the total that is produced by all people's work? What
    information does each person need, to make sensible
    consumption choices? What determines what is available and so
    how much say do we each have over what we get, including over
    what is available? </p>
    <p>Think of income as a claim on social product. Whatever
    income you get, or I get, or anyone gets, indicates how much
    of the product you, I , or anyone is entitled to have. The
    idea is we can each have a bundle of stuff, and its value has
    to equal the amount our income says we are entitled to. As to
    how this allocation occurs and how we can measure this value,
    that comes later. For now the question is, instead, what
    share in the whole should we each have? </p>
    <p>Historically there are not too many answers offered for
    this question. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>One possibility is that we are entitled to a share
            based on how much everything that we own produces-including
            not only our own labor, but our land, our machines,
            and so on. What our property produces, determine what
            share of the social product we deserve to consume. </li>
        <li>Second, we might receive a share based on what we,
            each individual, actually contribute to the social product.
            If I produce more, I get back more. If I produce
            less, I get back less. </li>
        <li>Next, perhaps we each just get whatever we can manage
            to grab. What we get, we get, by hook or crook, however
            much we or our property might produce-perhaps with a
            few laws limiting our methods. </li>
        <li>Another possibility is that we get according to our
            needs. Who needs more, gets more. Who needs less,
            gets less. </li>
        <li>Finally, another possibility is that we get in
            proportion to the effort and sacrifice we offer up in our
            work. Not the amount we produce, but the amount we
            labor... </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So, we all now know the drill. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do we feel about these options? These are the
            ones economists discuss. We have some overarching values.
            So which of these do we like, and why? And which do
            we reject, and why? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before we figure out actual institutional structures for a
    good economy, we have to know, in some more detail than just
    broad sweeping goals, what we want them to accomplish. And
    that is what we were up to last week, and now this week too. </p>
    <p>But what about the second issue raised above. What
    information do you need as a consumer to be able to do your consuming effectively
    and responsibly? </p>
    <p>Again, we can think of some possibilities... </p>
    <ol>
        <li>We arguably need to know our own preferences. What do
            we want? This is probably not controversial, but we
            might wonder whether it is always possible, in all
            economies... That is, what has to be true of the economy for
            us to be able to know this with some confidence? </li>
        <li>We also need to know what is available and what its
            value is so we can make our choices in a way that
            adds up to at most the total value of product we are
            entitled to. Sure, but what does it mean to say we
            need to know the value of each item? </li>
    </ol>
    <p>But&#133; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is this enough? Would it be sufficient to know our
            own needs and desires, honestly and fully, and to
            know what things cost (accurately, unlike in our current
            system)? Or is there other knowledge we should have
            if we are to make responsible and sensible decisions
            about consumption, in a way promoting the values we want
            our economy to attain? </li>
        <li>What about qualitative knowledge of material inputs
            and outputs, or qualitative knowledge of human
            effects, or of by products and their effects? Is this
            all just redundant, once we have good prices? Or do
            we need this level of knowledge as well as prices? </li>
        <li>Finally, how much say should each person have over
            what they consume? </li>
        <li>Do we just get what we say we want, with the sole
            constraint being that it is consistent with our income? </li>
        <li>Or should the actual make-up of our returns be
            impacted by people who are impacted by how we live
            our lives, in turn impacted by what we consume? And
            if so, what does this translate to as a guideline?
            Think about alcohol. </li>
        <li>And what should be the relation between group needs
            and individual needs in the process of arriving at outcomes? </li>
        <li>Now, finally, in light of all your answers, can you
            describe the income norms, information norms, and
            power norms of consumption as we know it in our
            society, and as you would like it, in brief summary,
            noting the difference. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please notice, this whole discussion does not occur at the
    level of we are too consumerist, or we eat too much, or such
    like. You might want to indicate why that is... </p>
    <p>Well, there are quite a few questions here. But, for now,
    if you have the time for it, try to answer, as best you can. Try
    also to utilize what we have already covered in answering the
    new questions. As usual, next lecture I will give my own
    responses and during the week, if you offer up some
    questions, or some replies that warrant comment, I will
    respond. </p>
    <p>Don't despair. Soon we will come to institutions. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this lecture we will try to hone our general values
    into specifics bearing on issues of allocation. First, however,
    answers to last lecture's questions. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers Lecture 4's Questions</h2>
    <p>For lecture 4, the focus was consumption values. How do we translate
    our overarching norms&#150;equity, solidarity, self-management,
    diversity, and efficiency&#151;into a set of more explicit
    aims regarding consumption? And what do we get when we do
    this? I thought it would be useful to focus on a few aspects of
    consumption: income, information, influence and incidence. </p>
    <p>I spelled out a few possibilities for how we might
    approach the four i's, and then asked for evaluations of each
    of these possibilities re the guiding values I am utilizing.
    So here are my answers to the questions I raised. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Income </h3>
    <p>It could be that we each have claims on output in
    proportion to how much of the means of production we own, or how
    productive the means of production we own are. </p>
    <p>This option yields differential income with no basis in
    anything that the individuals involved have actually done or
    committed of themselves. It is inequitable in the same simple
    way that it is inequitable if you give one child a very
    narrow straw, and another a wide straw, and set them both to the
    task of drinking out of a single milk glass, day in and day
    out for breakfast. </p>
    <p>As with the children, only more so, division according to
    capital ownership is not conducive to solidarity; jealousy
    and attempts to grab the bigger straw get in the way. </p>
    <p>More, when translated to income from milk consumption, the different
    income to different property owned approach ensures that
    those with high income will utilize it to enhance their
    abilities to control other choices&#151;who gets which toys,
    and, even more important, who gets the next technical innovation,
    the next bit of additional productive property, the computer
    as compared to the abacus for doing homework, thus also
    violating self management in a progressive spiral of
    divergence from proportionate say for all actors over the decisions affecting
    their lives. </p>
    <p>Regarding diversity, the option has relatively minor
    implications, I suppose, beyond narrowing options for some. </p>
    <p>As to efficiency, the option does foster the most
    productive use (or, more accurately, the most profitable use
    for the owner) of capital goods. But it does not lead to the
    widest possible development and utilization of people's talents and
    abilities. So if we could accomplish the first end--and
    improve it by making the aim of the use of the capital goods
    social well being rather than private profit--without
    sacrificing the second aim, the development of human potentials,
    we could make progress on the efficiency front too. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Or it could be that we each have claims on output in proportion
            to how much of it we are ourselves responsible for
            producing. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a very popular conception, including among people
    who call themselves socialists. If you produce more of the
    overall output of society than I do, you should have just
    that much more claim on the social product. Or so goes the
    argument. </p>
    <p>But what determines this gap between what you produce and
    what I produce? </p>
    <p>It could be ownership of better tools, etc., unless we
    have already ruled that out, as above. </p>
    <p>But it could also be that you work harder. Or that you
    have better training. Or that you are just plain more productive,
    intrinsically, because independent of how hard we work or how
    much training we have, you are quicker, stronger, calculate
    faster, have a better eye for design, or whatever. </p>
    <p>Should such differences be rewarded? </p>
    <p>Let's leave out of consideration the work harder component
    of the difference in output for now, dealing with it below,
    to consider first, instead, genetic endowment. </p>
    <p>If you are physically bigger and stronger, and we work
    equally hard and for an equal period of time, should you get
    more reward because your pile of output (picked oranges or
    whatever) is bigger than mine? Well, to reward this is to say
    that hey, since you were already lucky in the genetic
    lottery, now we will bestow on you some more advantage to go
    with what that luck already gave you. What justice is there
    in this? And it can't be a matter of incentives, as opposed
    to justice, either. For surely no matter how much or in what
    manner we set up our payment schemes, no one is going to be
    able to respond by improving their genetic endowment. There
    is no incentive effect on attributes that are beyond our
    control. And there is no moral reason to reward what we have
    nothing to do with determining either. So the option is inequitable
    and without redeeming worth. </p>
    <p>But what about differences in skill and knowledge that are learned,
    rather than inherited. Suppose I go to school for four years
    while you sweat in a mine. Then we both work someplace where
    my school training makes me more productive. Do I deserve to
    be paid more? First I enjoyed my school days while you
    enhanced your probability of dieing of black lung. Then I benefit again
    on top of that when I work at the same effort level as you, because
    my learned skills increase my output. </p>
    <p>What's the logic? It can't be moral. It can't be that I
    deserve more for my pleasurable time in school. Incentives you
    might say. We need to pay for the schooling or else people
    wouldn't do it. Well, yes, if the schooling is onerous and
    involves sacrifice and hard work, we ought to pay for that,
    like we pay for it in any productive contribution, because it
    is deserving and because the incentive effect is needed. But
    if a task we undertake is pleasant and fulfilling, than why
    do we have to pay a whole bunch extra to get people to do it? </p>
    <p>Answer: of course, we do not. This is just one more of the
    almost endless array of idiotic lies hoisted by economists
    upon the public. Ask yourself, given the choice do you opt
    for grad school or a job, say, in a coal mine, for the next 6
    years? Suppose the coal miner's pay is $30,000 a year. The incentives
    argument is that we need to pay you more, over a lifetime, in
    returns on the schooling, to get you to do it. Well, is this
    true? Would you do the schooling or the coal mining at
    $30,000 each. Now, how high do we have to raise the coal
    mining salary to get you to do it instead of the grad schooling
    at $30,000? </p>
    <p>The deduction is simple. There are elements of schooling
    and learning skills that should be remunerated, as work, in
    the same way as work is. But the accumulated skill, talents,
    and knowledge, which then contributes to output, should not
    be remunerated per se. </p>
    <p>OK, so what are the impacts on solidarity, self
    management, diversity, and efficiency? Well, what we are
    really talking about here, I believe, is a clear class
    division. A gap created between conceptual/order giving
    economic actors and instrumental order taking actors based on
    the qualitative effects of their activity, and on the remuneration
    for it as well. However this gap initially opens up (genetic
    endowment, training, luck, brute force) once it exists those
    with power and extra income will use it to further enhance
    the conditions of their dominance (by setting up things like
    the AMA, school tracking, etc.) thus gaining a disproportionate
    control over economic outcomes. A class rule is fostered:
    coordinator class dominance over working class dominated.
    Solidarity is gone. Diversity is delimited for those at the bottom--and
    even for those at the top who must defend their positions. </p>
    <p>Why then is this choice popular among many who call
    themselves socialists? Well, I have to say that I think that the
    answer is either ignorance, or that these individuals are
    victims of, rather than transcending, their class position.
    They are advocates of coordinator class vision and values, however unself-consciously, pure
    and simple. Often they take their stands with a heart...but
    then capitalists sometimes show a little heart too, as long
    as the basic underlying values that keep them on top are
    preserved. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Or it could be that we each have claims on output as
            large as we are able to bargain for, in a competition negotiation
            with others. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is just war by another name. And it is, in fact, what
    exists in real market economies. Remuneration is a function
    of such things as monopoly buying or selling power, control
    over technologies, barriers to entry, organizational might
    (in unions or corporations), ability to withhold assets and
    thereby wreck havoc, and so on and so forth. Power,
    bargaining power to be exact, is the main determinant of
    income. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is no equity in any humane sense. More like the law
    of a nightmare. Solidarity is gone. Self management is gone,
    etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Or it could be that we each have any claims on output
            that we wish to make--we just get whatever we say we want. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well this would be nice. And where does it all come from?
    This is, indeed, utopian. Meaning it is impossible because of limitations
    built into the domain we are discussing. It is like asking
    trees to fly, or the New York Times to tell the whole truth. Actually,
    in this event it is more like the former, as the constraints are
    due to physical laws not solely social ones (as in the Times case),
    but otherwise I hope the point is clear. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Or it could be we each have claims on output in
            proportion to our needs, as compared to everyone
            else. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This one is nice too. Indeed, it is really just four with
    a lid on demand. But what is the lid? Where is it established?
    Is it our needs/wants? And (a) how do we measure these, and
    (b) why is there in fact a lid on our needs/wants? The only
    way such a lid can arise is if we put limits on ourselves
    before the fact of knowing what society can deliver, or if we
    do it in light of understanding what the economy's situation
    and potential are. How do we do curtail ourselves without
    knowledge of potentials? Does everyone do it the same? Is it
    even a good idea? And if we are curtailing ourselves in light
    of potentials, that is merely operating in terms of a budget,
    and is not option 5. These are things to think about because
    they actually have implications later. The point is, we don't have
    to spend much time on this one now because surely expressed
    needs would greatly exceed available output now, so that this option
    immediately reverts to option 4 or has to be passed over on
    route to option 6. But what if we had socialist (or parecon)
    people, who had developed a profound social responsibility as
    a natural part of their beings (much as people now learn
    quite early how to grab?). Would we then want an economy in
    which people essentially limit their requests, but get what
    they say they want? (The only alternative still in the range
    of option 5 would be some objective determination of need
    from without, which would remove control over our lives from
    us, and is obviously a fiasco.) Would this in fact be good, as
    many intuitively think (especially greens)? (It is worth
    thinking about. I think the answer is no, this would not be
    ideal...) Anyhow, in the real world, for now and the
    indefinite future, 5 is utopian at least if thought of as
    operating as the sole criterion for allocation of all goods. (Though,
    say, for health care it might work fine...). </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Or it could be that we each have claims on output in proportion
            to the effort we expend and the sacrifices we incur
            in creating output. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, clearly I like this. It rewards what we in fact do
    have control over. So as an incentive it makes sense. As a fair
    act in response to our efforts it makes sense. I don't think
    it would disrupt solidarity, even if some people work a little
    harder and earn a little more and other people work a little
    less hard and earn a little less, supposing each person is
    free to choice any available option. The income differentials
    couldn't become very large, certainly not large enough to
    disrupt self management. All in all, I don't see any problem
    other than the following: What if I can't work? Or what if I
    have a disease, or a hurricane hits my neighborhood and so I
    have way more expenses than others? </p>
    <p>The answer, it seems to me is to have distribution
    according to need for calamities, health, and some other
    related similar facets of consumption. Where does it come
    from? Everything always comes form the overall social product.
    So, it must be that in our good economy some part of the
    total social product is set aside for these purposes. Thus,
    it is a kind of social fund, or insurance fund, if you like... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Or, it could some combination of the above. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Which is what I arrived at under the option 6 discussion
    above. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Information</h3>
    <p>Next, in lecture 4 I also asked: what kind of information
    must a person have to make sensible decisions about which
    items in particular they would like to get from amongst all
    those produced in society, up to their income level? What do our
    overarching values tell us ought to be our aims in this regard?
    And I presented some options and urged that each be
    evaluated. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>At a minimum it would seem that we each must at least
            have knowledge of our own preferences, and of the actual composition
            of available items to choose, and of their value (so
            we can sum up the value of all our choices to the
            limits of our share of the total available output).
            So, first, we could have only this knowledge in the
            form of self awareness, some kind of price structure,
            and some kind of informational advertising. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, this doesn't seem to have any first order
    implications for equity. Using the &#147;price
    indicators&#148; we can choose consumption goods totaling to
    our income level, and if that has been determined equitably,
    we are fine on this score. </p>
    <p>The approach doesn't do anything for solidarity, however,
    and arguably is even anti-solidaritous. Why? Well suppose you
    were operating in your family and you never took any account
    of the actual impact of what you are doing on anyone else. It
    just wasn't an option. Indeed, you could instead only consider implications for
    yourself. Not too solidaritous, not even if the other family members
    were recompensed when your choices affected them adversely. </p>
    <p>As to self management and diversity, I think the effects
    are modest depending on the effectivity of the pricing structure.
    If the prices reflect true social costs and benefits, than
    when we use them to make our choices we are at least judging
    in light of a sensible accounting. If they don't our best
    efforts will nonetheless diverge from our intentions. The
    informative problem about information in this option, however,
    to my thinking, is that while there is theoretically enough
    information in a price that represents true social costs and benefits
    (I am now assuming that the prices are that good, unlike market prices)
    for people to make good choices, there is no information to facilitate people
    actually feeling any concern for one another or having any
    empathy for one another, and regardless of their desires in
    the absence of this people have to act as though others do
    not even exist. </p>
    <p>Of course, if the price doesn't account for the full
    social costs and benefits, the effects on people, society,
    etc. etc.--then in addition to the problem of the absence of
    qualitative information, we will have a price that is misleading
    and our decisions will be inadequate no matter what our
    motivations may be. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We could add to the prior list of things we need to
            know, knowledge of what goes into producing the items that
            we might choose to consume, material inputs, that is. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words, we could add to a price indicator, some qualitative
    info about what the material components are. It is progress
    of a sort, but not much, at least bearing on the question above.
    We now know that when we buy a couch it uses rubber, and so
    has implications for rubber workers, but we know nothing about
    the circumstances of those workers. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We could add knowledge of the work conditions for
            those producing what we might choose to consume. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we are getting some place, with this knowledge we can
    have empathy for these people We can begin to overcome what
    is called alienation in the sense of starting to understand
    that each item we consume is really part and parcel of a
    social process rather than some finished independent entity with
    no history, links, human dimension, etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We could add knowledge of the by-products and all
            outputs of the production processes required to make available
            what we might choose to consume. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>More progress. More connectedness. More qualitative info relevant
    to our decisions. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We could add knowledge of the impact that our
            consumption of items might have on our neighbors, the community,
            etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As above. </p>
    <p>Next I noted in lecture 4 that in each of the above cases,
    we could encapsulate the added knowledge in the form of a
    price structure that more accurately incorporates all cost
    and benefits in the number we are presented, or we could have
    the information in a more qualitative or descriptive form, or
    we could have both. </p>
    <p>Well, I guess that in my above answers I temporarily
    cheated by mostly assuming away the inaccurate prices problem.
    But now let me clarify it. The best allocation system in
    creation is not going to have numbers (prices) which perfectly
    match real social costs and benefits. At best, they will be a
    very close representation. But there is an important problem
    lurking here. And this is so even assuming prices pay
    attention to all effects at the level of (5) above. </p>
    <p>When something is a little off, a tiny bit, it is
    generally no cause for hysteria. That is the nature of measurement. But,
    what if error accumulates. That is, suppose a price that
    deviates inexorably, however little, leads to choices which
    then cause further distortions in the same direction, and so
    on, and so on. Minor errors that arise for whatever reason
    are multiplied over time. Now you need some kind of
    corrective for your prices, which will inevitably have errors,
    to avoid those small errors leading to large problems. And
    you also need to be sure that the errors are truly random,
    rather than systematic. (Notice, with markets the errors in prices
    are systematic, due to not accounting for public and external
    effects, and so the problem of errors accumulating, Robin and
    I call it snowballing, is acute and also lacks a significant corrective mechanism).
    Anyhow, the point here is that there is a second purpose for
    the incorporation of qualitative information into a desirable
    economic system. First, it reduces alienation and facilitates
    solidarity (as well as empowerment through knowledge) as noted
    earlier. But, second, it acts as a corrective to prices alone
    which are, after all, supposed to be a congealed representation
    of all qualitative information. (If no one asks any questions
    about this, I may give a &#147;pop quiz&#148; on it...). </p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>Influence</h3>
    <p>The third focus in lecture 4 was how much say should we
    should each have in the final resolution of what exactly we
    get to fulfill our claims on productive output? Should it be
    our choice alone? Should others have impact? What context
    facilitates the preferred balance? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do we just get what we say we want, with the sole
            constraint being that it is consistent with our income? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since it is consistent with our income, it is equitable.
    But what if our choices impact on our neighbors? Or what if the
    workers don't want to expand output of some good we are
    trying to get a whole lot of? It seems that this issue is like
    that of information, but at the decision level... It should not
    be that prices alone are accountable for determining that
    people's wills are exercised in the right proportions given
    the effects people endure. The prices are guiding tools, indicative
    is the economic term, but there also ought to be qualitative information
    to use in these determinations. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should the actual make-up of our returns be impacted
            by people who consume other items? And if so, what does
            this translate to as a guideline? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well yes. Suppose my neighbors want to put a park into our community. Doesn't
    that have implications for me? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should the actual make-up of our returns be impacted
            by people who are impacted by how we live our lives, in
            turn impacted by what we consume? And if so, what
            does this translate to as a guideline? Suppose I want to
            buy a pet alligator for the back yard. Shouldn't the
            neighbor have a say in that? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the one hand, we want a degree of privacy. I don't want
    to have to ask for permission for everything I consume. On
    the other hand, my choices can affect the quality of life in
    my living group, neighborhood, etc. And so what I consume
    affects others, who therefore should have some level of impact (proportionate,
    of course) on the outcome. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What should be the relation between group needs and individual
            needs in the process of arriving at outcomes? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't know that there's a right answer, but it seems to
    me that you first have to resolve collective needs and consumption,
    and then in the context of those choices arrive at lower
    level smaller group choices, or individual choices. Whether I
    get skis depends on whether the region I am in chooses to maintain ski
    lifts, for example. And so on. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>Incidence</h3>
    <p>In this question I was merely seeking out awareness that
    there are goods that primarily affect individuals, small groups,
    larger groups, etc. And so there will need to be mechanisms
    for arriving at preferences at each relevant level: the
    individual person, the living group, community, neighborhood, region, whatever...and awareness
    that there is a logic in trying to deal with the more encompassing consumption
    first, as it establishes a context for the smaller group and
    individual choices. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Allocation Values</h2>
    <p>The next topic, the last we will deal with explicitly
    under the focus of values, is allocation values. How do we refine
    our broad values for the economy as a whole into more precise
    aims vis--vis allocation? Well, we do it, presumably, by
    thinking about what exactly allocation is, and then seeking to understand what
    kinds of specific aims we want for how we accomplish allocation
    so that it will further equity, solidarity, self management, diversity, and
    efficiency. </p>
    <p>So what is allocation? </p>
    <p>Suppose we have something we'll call economic activity. We have
    already seen that it can be production or consumption. </p>
    <p>In fact we have seen that production which has diverse
    inputs becoming diverse outputs, and consumption which has
    diverse inputs becoming diverse outputs, are in some sense
    the same. We use the word production when we are concerned
    about the outputs and the process of their creation. We use
    the word consumption when we are keying on the inputs. But
    each act of production also has what we can sensibly call a
    consumption moment, or aspect. And, likewise, each act of
    consumption also has what we can call a production moment or
    aspect. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Now consider the economy as a whole. Over a period
        of time lots and lots of stuff is taken in, processed,
        and then distributed to folks and entities (including
        groups, institutions, etc.) and utilized by them, in
        turn. Allocation is the name we give to economy activity
        when we want to focus on the aspect of determining the
        final lay of the land (what goes where, what is done and
        not done).</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Each act of consumption and production clearly has an
    allocation moment or aspect. For each act of production/consumption certainly
    influences this overall outcome for the economy. Yet there
    are some economic actions that are more allocational, in our sense,
    than others. For example, the interaction of actors deciding what to
    buy and sell in a market system or the process of the planning board
    meeting and proposing inputs and outputs for the steel
    industry in a centrally planned economy are both primarily allocational,
    rather than productive or consumptive. Yet these acts,
    notice, are also themselves part and parcel of consumption and
    production. We choose to feature them, however, when we are
    talking about the allocation aspect of economic activity. </p>
    <p>So, when talking about allocation we are talking about determination
    of outcomes. Again, consider a society at a moment in time,
    say day zero of year 2000. It has a certain condition, and it
    has certain possibilities. Indeed, imagine some kind of God could
    come down, take a look around, and then list all possible outcomes
    for day 365 of that same year in that same society. You have
    this and that. She has so and so. We have done such and such.
    Or, alternatively...this other arrangement is the result. And so
    on, though a nearly infinite list of possibilities. There are different
    amounts of this and that produced, with different actors, choices
    about technologies, and distributions of the products (and byproducts)
    in each different possible societal economic result. Now
    suppose we look at the same society/economy on day 365 of year 2000.
    In fact of all the possibilities, one has eventuated. We can call this
    the plan for the year 2000. Of course we have found it out
    after the fact, but, nonetheless, it is a map of what happened, and
    is, in precisely that sense, an enacted plan, whether or not anyone
    wrote it out before the fact or not. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Allocation is the economic process of whittling down
        from all the conceivable possible outcomes (plans) to the
        outcome that actually transpires (the enacted plan). What
        does the whittling?</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It depends on the economy. Market dynamics might do some
    of it, or central planners, or both. CEOs of firms may do
    some of it, or government bureaucrats. Workers might do some
    of it, as might consumers. So what is the point? </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Well, in thinking about allocation, with no biases interfering, what
        we want to ask is how should the whittling process occur in
        a good economy? What factors should be taken into
        account? How should knowledge of these factors be
        encapsulated and communicated to those who need it? What aims should
        be sought by those making decisions? And who should be
        making the choices in the first place, and with what level
        of impact? Then, if we have aims regarding about these
        matters, we will be in position to design institutions to
        carry out the injunctions.</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So, we know our broad values. We know, also, that in
    thinking about economic inputs and outputs we have much more
    in mind than just material things. (We also know that we have
    some aims already in mind for production and consumption, and
    we of course want allocation to operate consistently with these.)
    So, as with production and consumption, perhaps we can move toward
    some clarity about allocation by pursuing various questions concerning it.
    (These might not be quite as easy to even try to answer as
    those in prior lectures. But nobody said this would be easy
    all the time... And I have no doubt that those trying to
    answer are going to get far more out of this than those who
    just wait around for a few pages for my answers.) . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What kinds of decisions do workers (remembering self management
            in the workplace) need to be making in the production
            process? </li>
        <li>What information do workers need to have to make
            informed, solidaritous, equitable decisions about the options
            they face? </li>
        <li>Under markets and central planning, what are the
            answers to the prior two questions, not only for workers, but
            for other classes too? How do we want things to
            change? </li>
        <li>What kinds of decisions do consumers need to be
            making to determine what they want for their share of society's
            output? </li>
        <li>What kinds of information do consumers need to have
            at their disposal to make informed, solidaritous, equitable
            decisions about the options they face? </li>
        <li>Under markets and central planning, what are the
            answers to the prior two questions? How do we want things
            to change? </li>
        <li>How can all this needed knowledge be conveyed? </li>
        <li>How is the available knowledge conveyed in markets
            and central planning? What do we want to change between
            this and a good economy? </li>
        <li>What kind of organizational groupings can exist to
            deal with the fact that some choices are collective?
            Does it affect information requirements? </li>
        <li>If I need to know what you are wanting and willing to produce,
            and you need to know what I am wanting and willing to
            produce, before either of us can make decisions, and
            if our choices are going to change in light of changes
            that others make in their choices, and we are all
            going to participate, how can we possibly arrive at any
            conclusion? (8) What should be the relation between
            my consumption budget, the amount I am going to work,
            your budget, the amount you are going to work, and
            the whole economic product? </li>
        <li>Does the prior question have any answer in a market
            or centrally planned economy? </li>
        <li>Remembering that we have balanced job complexes, what will
            therefore be the main determinants of my income, even without
            knowing the components of my job complex? And is this
            how we want it to be? </li>
        <li>Should a particular workplace produce a new line of
            goods or not? What should govern this? What should we
            weigh off? How can it occur in some social process
            with the relevant actors having sensible input? </li>
        <li>What is the desirable criteria for determining
            whether my workplace gets what it wants by way of a
            new technological innovation? What about your
            workplace? What about my workplace versus yours? What
            is the impact of a new technological innovation
            installed in some part of the economy? </li>
        <li>What should determine the length of the work day? The volume
            of output for society? How much is set aside for calamities?
            (13) How should the ecology, or future generations,
            or the requirements of gender decisions be accounted
            for by a good allocation system? </li>
        <li>What does a plan set out on day zero for the economy,
            need to enunciate? How much detail about what is going
            to transpire by day 365? </li>
        <li>What should be the incentives that promote people
            actually fulfilling their respective roles in the year's
            plan? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I guess that's enough in the way of questions preparatory
    to next lecture. One thing critical to this conceptualizing business
    is obviously thinking up the questions in the first place. If
    you are trying to develop a theory, or a model, for example,
    you need to figure out your concepts, then you need to address
    the topic by trying to tease out what matters from what is
    really less consequential. One way to do this is by asking
    questions and answering them, and working the results into a
    theory, or vision. Actually, what really happens is more
    likely that you keep refining your choice of concepts, and
    your understanding of their interrelations, in light of how
    you answer the questions you ask, until you get to a
    compelling picture. That is what we are doing. anyhow. </p>
    <p>So how do you come up with the questions? Well, partly it
    is just creative and hard to give rules for, but partly there
    is a knack. You try to ask questions that isolate aspects you
    care about, that differentiate among alternatives, that reveal
    underlying causes and effects. And you try to be disciplined
    about it, meaning you try not to jump to answers (which,
    being spontaneous may be infected with presuppositions,
    prejudices, and just downright errors of myth) but to slowly
    and carefully work out answers paying special attention to
    using your conceptual toolbox, and to expanding it only when
    you absolutely need to. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At this point the idea is to think about the above
    questions, in light of the values we have posited and any
    others you may prefer, and what we have already said about
    our attitudes to production and consumption (our view of job
    complexes, remuneration according to effort and sacrifice,
    etc.), and using our many concepts. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We have now completed half of this course (book). In this
    lecture, 6, as in past ones, I would like to begin by presenting
    my answers to questions raised last time. Then I will try to
    very briefly summarize some of the ground we have already
    covered. Then we will move on to the institutional section of
    the course, including five more lectures, by dealing with
    production institutions. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 5 Questions</h2>
    <p>Here are my answers, briefly, to last time's questions. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What kinds of decisions do workers (remembering self
            management in the workplace) need to be making in the
            production process? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, they need to be making those decisions that affect
    them, in proportion as they are affected by them. So, clearly,
    they need to be making decisions about the organization of
    the workplace, the pace of work, the allocation of responsibilities,
    etc., at a very high level of impact. They need to be making decisions
    about output level, product characteristics, etc., at a high
    but not by any means exclusive level of impact. Every choice
    that must be resolved for each workplace has to be
    determined, it would seem, by some mechanism that combines
    the wills of the workers in that unit and the wills of the
    consumers and the broader public affected by the unit's actions,
    in the proper proportion. . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What information do workers need to have to make
            informed, solidaritous, equitable decisions about the options
            they face? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I work someplace and have to make choices about how
    much work I should do, how much product for consumption the
    plant should produce, etc., I have to know both the true
    social costs (in required material inputs, in the time of work
    and the quality of workers' circumstances, in pollution, in
    effects on workers, etc.) and the true social benefits
    arising from the use the product is put to, etc. </p>
    <p>One possibility is that I get this information in some
    kind of congealed form such as a price that succinctly summarizes
    all of it. </p>
    <p>Another possibility, more humane and informative about
    real social relationships, but with additional communications
    requirements and ease of use problems, is that I get this
    information, or can at least access it when I need it, in all
    its qualitative glory. </p>
    <p>Suppose consumer demand for air conditioners suddenly
    jumps. Is the only thing I need to know that people say that
    they want more? No, I need to know why, because I need to
    know whether the costs associated with choosing to raise my
    plant's refrigerator output (or my plant's freon output for
    use by the refrigerator industry) are warranted by the gains
    that will accrue from people having access to the new
    fridges. How might I get that information? Perhaps in a
    changed price that reflects their desire, as well as the
    added social costs of meeting it. Also, however, my economy
    might enable me to easily access qualitative data,
    descriptive accounts, to determine that a bunch of air conditioners
    made in the past have suddenly punked out, explaining the unusual
    increase in demand, or that there is a new game that can only
    be played in a cold room (which might not move me near as much,
    at least at first take). </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Under markets and central planning, what are the
            answers to the prior two questions (not only for
            workers, but for other classes too)? And how do we
            want things to change? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under markets each worker has the option to choose only
    whether or not to sell their labor power to their employer,
    or to try to switch to some other job, or perhaps to fight
    for better conditions in the current one. Within the workplace,
    below the coordinator class level, all but low-relevance
    decisions about production are already taken. Yes, we have to
    decide how to move our bodies, etc., within the constraint of
    getting the job done, but that's about it save insofar as we
    are rebelling against our conditions and therefore operating outside
    or against the economy's logic. </p>
    <p>For the coordinator class, however, the decision process
    is more complex. On the one hand, subordinate to capital and
    wanting to keep their jobs at capital's behest, they need to
    know the implications of each choice for the only thing that
    matters to capital: bottom line outcomes including short-term
    profit and longer term market share and economic power. But
    from their own perspective, like workers, coordinators also
    need to decide where they wish to be working and, wherever
    that might be, they can seek to try to improve their
    conditions of work, their power at work, and their income, at
    that site. This generally involves making themselves as indispensable
    as possible (which is rarely precisely the same as maximizing
    profits or the dominance of capital) and leads to interesting
    questions about efficiency and waste from different angles of
    interest... </p>
    <p>As to capitalists, they need to know who to employ to have
    their workplaces pursue the ends they seek. And they need to
    know how to extract the obedience and effort they seek. Or,
    if they are on the site themselves, they need to know the
    bottom line issues bearing on costs and revenue. Capital and coordinators need
    to know, as well, therefore, what the public is willing to
    pay for products, what it costs to hire labor and purchase
    resources, how to organize work to reduce the power of labor
    to demand more income or to slow the pace of their efforts,
    etc. </p>
    <p>Note, the required information isn't the implications of
    consuming the product for people or society (much less the full
    implications of production decisions for the well being of
    workers or the community). These are only a second order
    concerns, at best, and then only insofar as they affect what really matters,
    which is profits and the ability to appropriate them. </p>
    <p>The price, conveniently for the interests of those
    dominating the economy, isn't a token that clarifies the full implications
    of economic choices on everyone affected. Prices instead
    summarize power relations, not full social costs and benefits,
    and this is precisely in tune with what dominant classes need
    to carry out their responsibilities. </p>
    <p>Under central planning the workers in plants need to know
    nothing other than the orders they have to fulfill and the techniques
    they need to use to do it. The planners may have different
    needs. Arguably, they need to know the full social costs and
    benefits of each possible choice, so they can create a socially optimal
    plan, assuming that is their assignment. In practice,
    however, they generally need some awareness of overall impact
    and effects, but will be much more interested in how economic alternatives
    that they must choose among impact on their own positions in society,
    particularly their power and their income. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What kinds of decisions do consumers need to be
            making to determine what they want for their share of society's
            output? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>How much they want to work. What they want to own. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What kinds of information do consumers need to have
            at their disposal to make informed, solidaritous, equitable
            decisions about the options they face? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I can't buy something responsibly without confidence that
    my choice is a socially sensible one. I need to know, therefore,
    the benefits to me, but also the costs to society and to
    other individuals of making what I want available to me. This
    information could be conveyed by prices&#151;assuming they
    represent true social costs and benefits&#151;or by
    qualitative accounts that convey a textured and revealing
    picture of just what goes on in production, allocation, consumption. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Under markets and central planning, what are the
            answers to the prior two questions? How do we want things
            to change? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In markets and central planning there is no way to know
    anything about the circumstances of others, nor to account for
    such information in one's consumption preferences&#151;at
    least within the norms of these systems. Thus all that is needed
    is a price, a budget, and some information about the purpose and character
    of products (sort of what advertising is...), where all of
    these bits of information are, however, not about costs and
    benefits, but about power, and, in any event skewed by power
    to serve its interests (as in advertising that manipulates
    rather than informing, for the obvious reason that the seller's interest
    is to sell, not to meet needs or provide means to fulfill real
    desires...) . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How can all this needed knowledge be conveyed? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, one possibility, as already noted, is that it is
    encapsulated in a number, a price, which represents a tally
    of all social costs and benefits. Another possibility is that
    the information is conveyed qualitatively, as accounts of workplace
    conditions, info about inputs and outputs, and so on. It may
    well be, indeed, that we have to use both information
    mechanisms. The first has the virtue of brevity and ease of
    use in trying to make determinations. For example, we don't
    know how much we should opt to consume, to take our share,
    but not more than our share. If prices are accurate, our budget
    tells us this quickly and let's us operate on the insight
    easily. </p>
    <p>The second approach, qualitative accounts, on the other
    hand, has the virtue of empowering us, expanding our awareness,
    facilitating solidarity and empathy, and--and this proves to
    be quite important&#151;of being less subject to unseen biases
    and therefore of providing a kind of check on and corrective
    of digital prices. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How is economic information conveyed in markets and
            central planning? What do we want to change between
            this and a good economy? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In markets there are prices (which convey the available
    knowledge, which is not, however, a tally of all social costs
    and benefits but instead a tally of what people are willing
    to pay and able to charge in light of their bargaining power).
    There is also advertising, geared to generate a sale,
    regardless of the actual benefits that would accrue to the
    user thereby. </p>
    <p>In central planning information and motivations can take a
    variety of forms. Inevitably, however, the wills of planners
    will predominate and this would, in time, skew information
    (including prices and descriptive accounts) in ways corresponding
    with their view of the world, and their interests within the economy.
    More, in central planning the information is not, below the
    top, for people to make decision, but for people to implement
    decisions made by others. </p>
    <p>Presumably, in a good economy we want information
    consistent with a full accounting of implications of economic
    actions, consistent with decision making by those affects,
    and consistent with the insight that nobody would want to
    produce or sell anything that wasn't going to benefit
    consumers&#151;why waste one's time in such a ludicrous or
    even counter productive pursuit? </p>

    <ul>
        <li>What kind of organizational groupings can exist to
            deal with the fact that some choices are collective?
            Does it affect information requirements? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can have units that operate collectively in their
    decision making. In workplaces this can be anything from a work
    group or team to a workplace or industry wide council.
    Regarding consumption, this can include living groups, living
    areas, neighborhoods, counties, etc. etc. beyond the level of
    the individual. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If I need to know what you are wanting and willing to
            produce, and you need to know what I am wanting and willing
            to produce, before either of us can make decisions,
            and if our choices are going to change in light of changes
            that others make in their choices, and we are all
            going to participate, how can we possibly arrive at any
            conclusion? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It seems to follow that we have to have a kind of
    self-conscious negotiating process in which there is a steady accrual
    of information about desires and preferences, all providing a
    context for people to make known their choices, and to in
    turn moderate them in light of the choices other people opt
    for, until there is a workable outcome. The other three
    options are each inconsistent with one or more of our guiding
    values, equity, self management, solidarity, diversity, and
    efficiency. They are a kind of dynamic exchange in which, however,
    power or competition acts to constrain outcomes down to final choices
    (markets), or a top down determination of choices (central
    planning). or a (well motivated but ultimately
    counter-productive) decentralization of economic scale so
    extreme that all decisions are made on the spot, by all concerned
    and effected, because there is little division of labor or
    need for complex allocation at all. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What should be the relation between my consumption
            budget, the amount I am going to work, your budget,
            the amount you are going to work, and the whole
            economic product? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I am working at a balanced job complex, the length of
    my work time at this complex is a measure of my effort and
    sacrifice. With equity, what I get for that average exercise
    is an average income. With these equilibrations, the value of
    my consumption budget should match the value of yours, and of everyone
    else's. The only variation would be due to my working
    overtime, or my taking extra time off, etc. But this means
    that my proposal for how much I want to work is also,
    implicitly, a statement about the total social product and about
    how much I (and everyone else) will be budgeted to consume. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does the prior question have any answer in a market
            or centrally planned economy? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not really. There is no regular relation, other than as
    mediated through bargaining power in the market economy, between
    consumption preferences and work outlays in markets. And in
    the planned economy, it depends on the norms of distribution
    that are employed and the class biases of planners. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remembering that we have balanced job complexes, what
            will therefore be the main determinants of my income,
            even without knowing the components of my job
            complex? And is this how we want it to be? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>How long do I work? The idea is simple. Imagine we all do
    precisely the same task. Then what is the measure of effort
    and sacrifice? Clearly it is duration. Now, supposing that we
    all do different things, if their overall qualitative impact
    on our quality of life and empowerment are equal, still duration
    is the right measure. And, yes I think this is fine. It is
    quite consistent with everything we have postulated so far as
    guiding values. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should a particular workplace produce a new line of
            goods or not? What should govern this? What should we
            weigh off in deciding? How can it occur in some
            social process with the relevant actors having
            sensible input? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, what will be the costs of beginning this new line?
    And what will be the benefits? We are going to need some
    resources (which could go to other ends instead, some labor,
    etc. There may be some pollution. It would be onerous work,
    and so on. On the other hand, if we undertake the innovation
    we will accrue this new product that presumably people will
    benefit from. So the question is, does the benefit out weigh
    the cost so that on balance the investment is a good idea
    compared to other possible choices of what we might do with
    our time, resources, tools, etc. As to how the decision can
    be reached by real people in real time, well, my answer on
    that will have to wait coming discussions. . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the desirable criteria for determining
            whether my workplace gets what it wants by way of a
            new technological innovation? What about your
            workplace? What about my workplace versus yours? What
            is the impact of a new technological innovation
            installed in some part of the economy? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This question is pretty interesting, I think. Suppose I
    work in a plant that produces refrigerators, and you work in
    a publishing house. OK, by this time we hopefully realize
    that if the values implemented in our economy are those we
    have highlighted so far in our discussions, in my plant and
    in yours there are going to be balanced job complexes.
    Moreover, if in your publishing house the average job complex
    is more desirable than the societal average (which is pretty
    likely) and in my refrigerator factory it is less desirable
    (for the sake of this discussion) then I will get to work
    some hours outside of my factory at a nice and empowering set
    of tasks, and you will have to work some hours outside your
    publishing house, balancing off its quality job offerings with
    some onerous tasks elsewhere. </p>
    <p>Now suppose someone in my factory comes up with an idea
    for changing the assembly line to make the work more
    desirable. And someone in your publishing house also comes up
    with an innovative idea, having to do with improving your
    phone system that would improve conditions for editorial work.
    Which investment should be a higher priority to
    undertake&#151;from a social perspective? What about from
    your perspective and mine? </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Well, from society's viewpoint we prefer to
        undertake the innovation that will have the larger positive
        effect on work roles, outputs, etc., compared to its
        cost. But, and this is the interesting thing, whereas in
        a market or a centrally planned economy you would prefer
        that the innovation in your workplace be enacted and I
        would prefer that the innovation in my refrigerator plant
        be enacted, regardless of their relative merits, in a parecon
        we would each prefer that whichever of the two
        innovations would have the larger positive effect be enacted.
        I find this to be a remarkably robust and alluring attribute
        of parecon. That is, in parecon over time the only impact
        that ultimately affects us is not proximity to an innovation&#151;but
        any innovation's implications for (a) the overall average
        societal job complex (if the complex gets better, everyone
        gets a better job and if average societal job complex gets
        worse everyone gets a worse one, regardless of where the innovation
        occurs and of where people work), or (b) the overall social
        product (if it gets larger we get a bigger consumer budget,
        if it gets smaller we get a smaller consumer budget, again regardless
        of where we live or work).</i> </p>
        <p><i>Therefore, with this system we inevitably benefit
        most from what everyone benefits most from, and vice
        versa. Something to think about. We innovate in the coal
        mine. How long does it take for the innovation's positive
        effects to be averaged out so that everyone everywhere
        has the same gain in their lives due to it? What are the implications
        of our choices about how long this averaging should take?
        What is the rhetoric in a market economy about
        innovations, and what is the reality?</i> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>What should determine the length of the work day? The
            volume of output for society? How much is set aside for
            calamities? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The length of the work day should be impacted by how much
    leisure people want, versus how large a consumption budget
    they want, assuming attention to all other social costs and
    benefits. The size and composition of the social product
    should be impacted by people's preferences for consumption
    versus their desires to have time to enjoy it, again,
    assuming attention to all other social costs and benefits. How
    much to set aside for calamities should be impacted by good
    predications as to their likely impact. </p>
    <p>What about under markets? Well, in that case the
    allocation system itself creates a drive for growth that transcends
    the will of any actors. More, a set of actors who is given
    dominant power over outcomes, is also given an interest in
    growth. As a result, in a market system the link between the amount
    of output desired and the amount of leisure desired is
    largely sundered for most people. We will have to work our
    heads off so we want as much as we can have. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a similar, but weaker tendency in a centrally
    planned economy, where certain kinds of innovations and grandiose
    scale of operations help solidify and enlarge the claims on
    power of the dominant coordinator class. </p>
    <p>About calamities, here is something to think about. What
    should be the locus of decision-making, of payment, and of
    receipt of payment when there are accidents, grave illnesses,
    etc.? What is the value being upheld? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How should the ecology, or future generations, or the
            requirements of gender decisions be accounted for by
            a good allocation system? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These, it seems to me, are to be accounted however people
    choose politically to have them accounted for. That is, they
    are not intrinsically economic questions, but, in the first
    place, questions whose answers depend on implementation of
    cultural structures, gender roles, etc., beyond the
    underlying bounds of economic rationality, though impacting
    on it. There could be ecological norms that must be abided.
    Their could be rules about the volume of output that has to
    be devoted to investment for betterment of life in the future.
    Their could be rules about gender balance. And so on. We thus
    want an allocation system that is not only capable of
    operating sensibly economically, but that is able to do so
    even while abiding such extra economic injunctions deriving
    elsewhere in society &#150;just as we want kinship relations,
    community relations, a polity, etc. that is able to function
    compatibly with the dictates and requirements of our
    envisioned economy. This degree of flexibility exists, we will
    see, for parecon. It can also arguably exist for central
    planning. It does not and cannot exist, however, for markets. Staunch
    right-wing defenders of markets are right about this. That
    is, if we claim to want markets because of various virtues we
    find in them, we are inconsistent when we impose constraints upon
    their operations. Why? Because the arguments that convinced us
    markets have certain virtues (which are wrong in any event,
    but if we were marketeers we wouldn't think that) loose all
    their force (even in the eyes of marketeers) once we
    interfere, even minimally, in market operations. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does a plan set out on day zero for the economy,
            need to enunciate? How much detail about what is going
            to transpire by day 365? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a bit tricky, I think, and perhaps a little
    premature. The idea is simple, and then there are just a bunch
    of statistical tricks and other such things that ease the
    task and figuring out what these &#147;tricks&#148; might be
    is the key to answering this question. </p>
    <p>You want a set of aims for everyone in the economy. Thus,
    you need to know people's and groups consumption choices, and
    what each workplace is to produce, by what means, with what
    in puts and outputs. But in needing to know what everybody is
    going to consume, how much detail do we need? Can we extrapolate
    the details, just from knowing certain gross figures and
    certain reliable things about people, or our population in
    particular? Thus can we go from number of shirts wanted, to numbers
    of each size shirt, or type shirt, sufficiently closely so
    that we only need the first piece of data to arrive at all the
    conclusions? What about knowing about nuts, as compared to
    surveying detailed preferences for all kinds of nuts? Is the
    former enough to deduce the latter? And so on. Do we each
    need to predict the likelihood that we will need medicines?
    Or meet new people or have children unexpectedly, etc.? Do we have
    to predict which nights during the year we are going to want to
    go out for dinner? Or what will be the amount of food we wish
    to buy day by day or week by week, for the whole year? Or can
    all these things be accounted for in a gross and average way
    by the system, based on extrapolations from broader stated
    preference of individuals, plus knowledge from past
    experiences, and so on? </p>
    <p>Think about what the workers in a factory creating some
    product need to know&#151;and what the planning process needs
    to discern for them to be able to have that required
    information... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What should be the incentives that promote people
            actually fulfilling their respective roles in the year's
            plan? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, given our values, it seems like this should be a
    degree of material incentive&#151;that is, access to a fair
    share of the social product&#151;and a degree of
    social/personal incentive, that is, the respect or even the
    admiration of one's work mates. For this type of incentive
    system to work, a far cry from the desire to be rich or to
    avoid poverty&#151;it must be that all alternative and contrary
    ways of orienting one's priorities are considerably worse. There
    are, that is, two sides to incentives. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rewarding desirable behavior. And . </li>
        <li>Making undesirable behavior unattractive or
            worthless. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thus, for example, we can reward effort and sacrifice,
    both materially and with respect, and we can reward creativity
    and accomplishment, with respect and emotional responses, and
    we can structure outcomes so that behavior like shirking, or
    stealing, or trying to disproportionately influence outcomes
    yields no gains and only exacts losses for the perpetrator. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In light of all the above, and our overarching
            values, and the aims we have already espoused for production and
            consumption, what do you think ought to be our aims
            for a desirable allocation system? What, when all is
            said and done, should delimit options down to
            outcomes? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This question harks back to the description of allocation
    at the outset of the last lecture, and I would like to recontextualize
    it, to hammer home some of the images/insights. We have, at
    the outset of any economic period, an almost infinite array
    of possible outcomes we might choose for our economy. This great
    diversity doesn't mean all economies offer up all possible
    outcomes. This is quite false. For example, class divided
    economies don't offer classless outcomes. Economies based on
    wage slavery don't offer unalienated outcomes. And so on. </p>
    <p>But any economy offers countless possible outcomes, even
    within the limitations of abiding its biases and reproducing
    its central features. Now, suppose we focus our attention on
    the various processes that delimit from the immense set of
    possible outcomes down to the actual set of outcomes that do in fact
    transpire. We can call the factors that induce this narrowing
    of options all the way to a final choice, the <i>economic
    processor</i>. We can also, however, note that it doesn't
    happen in one immense swoop. Even in the most dictatorial centrally
    planned economy, there are many facets that influence the
    narrowing from all possibilities down to one enacted choice&#151;the
    allocation process, including the operation of many economic
    processors. Suppose we go back even further. We start out
    with all the outcomes that are possible given the laws of
    physics. Then there is, first, a processing of this set of
    options down by the fact that we have a certain level of
    technology, certain economic institutions and roles, etc.
    (This is exceptionally important for evaluating alternative
    economies&#151;that is, there different implications for the
    overall possibility set of options for production and
    consumption.) . </p>
    <p>Anyhow, within a good economy, the upshot of the answers
    above and of our discussion thus far, I think, is that what
    we want is that the processor is to the greatest extent
    possible, the population, pure and simple. The allocation system
    should manifest people's will on outcomes in proportion as
    they are affected by those outcomes. It is human need and
    desire and potential, mediated so that everyone has a fair
    and proportionate say, that should take society from the
    almost infinite possibility set of what to do with its
    economic potential for the year, to what it actually will do.
    And, moreover, the economies institutions should not delimit
    the overall possibility set in any way that limits the extent
    to which we can attain equity, self-management, solidarity,
    diversity, or efficiency. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Summary Results of the First Half of our Lectures</h2>
    <p>Leaving out some the details I would say that so far we
    have covered the following-- . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A methodology for creating useful vision . </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Define our domain of concern, Determine its main component
    elements. Determine what it is, in broad value terms, that we
    want to achieve with our vision for this domain. Examine in
    more detail the main component features, and determine what
    we want for each of them, broadly speaking. Implement our
    aims in institutional designs and structures for the
    component features. Be sure the components that we envision
    fit together. Be sure the whole vision for our domain fits
    with the rest of the domains of society. Move on to issues of implementation, refinement,
    etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clarification of what the economic domain is . </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have highlighted production, consumption, and
    allocation, and we have clarified what each embodies and involves
    in terms of types of roles, processes, information,
    decisions, inputs and outputs, etc., what their relations to
    one another are, etc. Our results have been about 180 degrees
    off from what is typically thought/taught, about economics,
    even by most radicals. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Situating our efforts vis--vis types of economies . </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have created a typology of economies and situated those
    we know about regarding their component features, class
    structure, etc. and the implications of these for human well
    being and development. Again, our views have been at odds
    with generally accepted views, mainstream and radical as
    well. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clarification of our goals broadly, and for each of
            the main parts of the economy . </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have settled on four primary guiding values (some of us
    may have some more we are employing), and we have used these
    and our clarification of what economics is about, etc., to
    elaborate more detailed goals for each of the main aspects of
    any economy, its production, consumption, and allocation institutions.
    All this is more or less unique to us and in large part
    contrary to views held by other economists, etc. </p>
    <p>So, at this point, if this were a traditional course, I
    would expect everybody to be able to write a lucid and insightful
    essay presenting the ideas and claims and logic for each of
    the four above &#147;achievements&#148; of the course to
    date, and either supporting or criticizing our results. That
    would mean you are with us. If you feel you couldn't write
    such an essay, or take such a stance in a discussion, you
    might want to review prior lectures and exchanges or ask some
    questions. If I were giving a test at this point, I would
    likely assume the above level of awareness of what has gone
    on so far as a given, (that is, that everyone could fill out
    the above outline pretty substantially) and instead ask you
    to try to do as much of the above as you could in an essay,
    not for economics, but for, say, gender relations or
    cultural/community relations. Or, as an alternative test
    question choice, I might ask you to defend some system other
    than parecon by way of some set of values other than those we have enumerated,
    showing how the other model (say capitalism) is a perfectly logical
    and sensible one, given the other set of values. </p>
    <p>Either of these essay topics would seem to me to be a good
    exercise in the types of conceptualizing central to thinking
    about vision. But, be that as it may, now we are ready to try
    to actually design some institutional features, first for
    production, then for consumption, and then for allocation. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Production Institutions</h2>
    <p>Well, now we have reached the actual stage of trying to
    design/describe institutional structures that fulfill our aims.
    Think of a workplace. It could be modest, say ten or fifteen
    people, or it could be huge, say 1,000 or even 5,000 people.
    Perhaps a little production unit, or a major university or hospital
    or assembly operation. Within this place, how do we want
    decisions to be made? And what organizational forms will we
    employ to facilitate our preferred decision-making schemes? </p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>Decisions</h3>
    <p>Suppose we think of the workplace as a gigantic process,
    with inputs and outputs, of course. What are the decisions?
    Well, what will be produced, by what means, at what pace,
    with what technologies? What will be the jobs and who will
    fill them? During each day, how will we get our work done? What will
    I do, what will you do, how will we mesh our efforts
    successfully with each other and with others throughout the
    plant? </p>
    <p>Some of the decisions are interactive with the rest of the
    economy&#151;they are part and parcel of the broad level of allocation.
    Some, are more a matter of implementation, organizing the
    workday given its broad aims. We all know from experience
    these latter types of decision, and we can easily conceive of the
    former types, though few of us have probably ever been
    involved in making any of them. </p>
    <p>(If you think in terms of the processor idea re allocation
    you can see that we are on a particular part of the continuum.)
    . </p>
    <p>Now any workplace has some processes and associated
    decisions that involve many people very interactively and
    mutually dependently&#151;for example, how much product, what
    new technology or social organization? And each workplace has
    some processes and decisions that involve a smaller array of people
    most directly&#151;for example how should the personnel
    department or the promotion department organize to accomplish
    its responsibilities&#151;with the determinations usually
    dependent on prior higher level choices as well. And some decisions
    that are narrower still&#151;can I trade responsibilities
    with you today, what order am I going to do my tasks in this
    morning&#151;that are, however, delimited by a whole array of
    prior more encompassing decisions. We also know the general
    menu of decision making methodologies we can employ, I think. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>We can have direct face to face debate followed by
            votes with various rules for determining outcome (authoritative
            decisions, one person one vote, majority rules, you
            need two-thirds, or whatever). </li>
        <li>We can have delegation of authority, either by
            permanent appointment, or recallable representatives,
            or rotated &#147;office holders&#148; or whatever. </li>
        <li>Individuals can be left to decide whatever they want,
            with differences mediated after the fact. </li>
        <li>Bosses can be the deciders and the rest followers. </li>
        <li>Everything can be determined at an overarching level,
            or decisions can be taken at many levels. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>And so the question arises, from among all that is
    possible, what do we want? What ways of making decisions about
    the workplace best implement our values: equity, diversity,
    solidarity, and participatory self management? Or any others
    that you may wish to pose as more relevant or more important?
    And is there only one right answer to this question? Here are
    some thought questions to pursue: . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is economic democracy in the workplace and why
            do we want it? </li>
        <li>Is there any difference between workplace and polity
            that justifies a different decision making attitude regarding
            each? </li>
        <li>What is the difference between utilizing expertise
            and employing hierarchy regarding workplace decisions and
            what attitude do you have to each? </li>
        <li>How should decisions over global workplace issues be
            arrived at and settled on? </li>
        <li>What about implementation decisions concerning the
            work of a team or other group? </li>
        <li>What about how you do your work at your work station,
            or desk, or assembly site, or whatever? </li>
        <li>What would be the arguments against what you have
            proposed, offered by capitalists, offered by coordinators
            (managers), offered by some workers? </li>
        <li>And how do you refute these arguments? </li>
        <li>Suppose you have one person, one vote, and majority
            rule. And full opportunity for discussion. Do you thereby
            automatically have desirable democracy and
            participation? </li>
        <li>If you have a formally desirable structure, might you
            still have, in practice, undemocratic dynamics? Why? What
            could be done about it? </li>
        <li>How much can we sensibly ask from our institutional
            choices? </li>
        <li>What other questions would be useful in provoking
            commentary regarding institutional choices for workplace
            decision-making structures? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>Councils and Job Complexes</h3>
    <p>In implementing our values and aims in the workplace, so
    far we have the idea of decision- making by consensus and/or
    diverse vote-level requirements (50%+, 66%+, or whatever),
    sometimes with all involved actors voting, sometimes by
    representative, all done at various natural levels of involvement&#151;the
    whole workplace council, divisional or section councils, project
    groups and work teams, and individuals. And we have the
    overriding proviso that this structure needs to not only be formally
    democratic in what people are allowed to do&#151;but that the
    actors engaged in the interactions also have to be prepared
    to utilize the possibilities available to them. Thus they must
    all have background, education, work experience and
    knowledge, sufficient for them to utilize their formal rights
    to speak, judge, and vote. </p>
    <p>To accomplish this latter aim clearly has implications for
    schooling and for distribution of information and resources
    generally. We can't have a sector of society with tremendous
    access to information at home and others with little, nor a
    sector with the time and freedom and energy to utilize such
    access, and another sector too exhausted to ever take
    advantage of it. And we certainly can't have a large part of
    the population educated at school in ways that destroys
    initiative and deadens potentials, preparing people, against
    their capacities and inclinations, to endure boredom and embrace
    passivity, while a much smaller sector is taught to feel that
    it not only has the right and the wisdom to decide all for
    itself and for others, but is also given the tools and confidence that
    give this arrogance a high degree of accuracy. </p>
    <p>But, this is not the end of the implications. Much of our
    time is spent on the job. And much of the foundation for on-the-job
    participation is on-the-job empowerment or disempowerment. If
    we divide up work so that some people have job circumstances
    that do nothing to promote skills and talents and to convey
    knowledge requisite to decision making, and that instead tend
    to curtail or totally prevent access to these, or that even
    destroy such inclinations and possibilities&#151;then these
    people will not participate much in decision making regardless
    of formal rights to do so. </p>
    <p>And, similarly, if some people have work situations and
    responsibilities that give them markedly more knowledge and
    skill and talents and energy for decision making, rather than
    squander this asset, it is likely that their wills will in
    almost all instances translate into the will of the whole
    workplace disproportionately to their numbers or to the
    degree that outcomes affect them as compared to other people.
    The above is a powerful reason, we have argued, not to divide
    work into homogenous job complexes, each with a different
    make-up than the rest (which is fine) but each of which is
    also homogenous and of different empowerment impact than the
    rest. To implement this type hierarchy of jobs is, in the
    first place, to violate our self-management values, and in
    the second place it is to produce class divisions, which in
    turn enhance differentials not only of power, but also of circumstance
    and income. </p>
    <p>A second reason to avoid defining jobs in a hierarchical
    manner is that it is unjust. There is no moral excuse for having
    some people occupy less fulfilling (or more unfulfilling,
    depending on the average work quality the economy has attained
    by organizational and technological innovations) work circumstances than
    others. So what is the solution? </p>
    <p>Well, we have argued that it is creation of balanced job
    complexes, one of the central innovations of the economic
    vision called parecon. (Or, perhaps you may think of an
    alternative approach to meeting all these requirements, in response
    to this lecture, or will raise new objections to the aims themselves-.) And
    so at this point the issue becomes, what are balanced job
    complexes, how are they established, how do they change over time,
    how does a person wind up doing one or another, and what are
    the negative implications of having them, if any. </p>
    <p>For purposes of the following questions, I hope people
    will think seriously about the issues at hand, in the abstract
    and also regarding your own work experiences. Balanced job
    complexes means there is no such thing as a traditional
    secretary, though there are secretarial tasks divided into
    job complexes along with other tasks. There is no such thing
    as a janitor. There is a division of labor, able to be far
    more self-consciously crafted to fulfill values and aims than
    now, including productivity and efficiency norms, but this
    division does not allow for certain distributions of tasks, while
    making others perfectly acceptable. </p>
    <p>Few if any of us, I suspect, work at what is an average
    job complex for our workplace much less for the economy as a
    whole. Indeed, few progressive and left projects enact these
    norms, mostly incorporating instead structures virtually
    indistinguishable from those of the companies and corporations
    they oppose... Here are some questions to help push forward
    the discussion. If you ignore them, or fail to produce your
    own different or better questions, or fail to comment, then
    the exercise won't be nearly as worthwhile as it might be, I should
    think. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a balanced job complex? What are the
            arguments for having them? What arguments can you
            raise against having them? </li>
        <li>What is the refutation of arguments against balancing
            job complexes, and which way do you lean? </li>
        <li>How would your job change if your work institution
            were to balance job complexes internally? </li>
        <li>How do you think it would change if complexes were
            then also balanced across all workplace, with the economy
            as it is, other than this change? </li>
        <li>What would be the effect of introducing balanced job
            complexes into your workplace, now? What about as part
            of a national program that included retraining, etc.? </li>
        <li>What would be the implication of having balanced job
            complexes in your workplace for the implementation of
            new technologies and other innovations? </li>
        <li>What is the relationship between having balanced job
            complexes in a good economy, and the process of deciding
            on investments, new technologies, etc. </li>
        <li>Does having balanced job complexes oppress anyone, or
            reduce the well being of anyone, as compared to having
            more traditional job arrangements? </li>
        <li>If you like the idea of job complexes, how would you
            reply to someone saying that they are unfair to very brilliant
            people, or impose too much responsibility on many
            people who won't want it? </li>
        <li>Do you have any idea at all what the organizational
            structure is, what the internal values are, etc. etc.
            of political projects and institutions that you relate
            to, support, etc.? Why do you think you don't,
            assuming that is the case? </li>
        <li>If you find the idea of balanced job complexes
            righteous and valid, or at least plausibly so, I wonder
            if you could hazard a guess as to why they are not a
            widely discussed programmatic aim among leftists... . </li>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this lecture, 7, as in past ones, I would like to begin
    by presenting my answers to questions raised last time. Then
    we will move on to the second consumption discussion. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 6 Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is economic democracy in the workplace and why
            do we want it? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>At a minimum economic democracy would be something like
    one person-one vote on all policy questions, and some form of
    self regulation with oversight on everything else. But given
    our values, economic democracy is something a little more
    subtle. That is, each worker should have a say in workplace decisions
    more or less in proportion as he or she is affected by those decisions.
    How I conduct myself when sweeping, say, or when writing something,
    etc., is going to affect others mostly in terms of whether I
    get the task done, unless I want to sing while I work, or
    something like that, and it bothers others. So, generally,
    but for exceptional disturbing choices, I decide how to carry
    out my personal responsibilities myself, within the bounds of fulfilling
    my responsibilities. It is autocratic, I suppose, but
    acceptably so... </p>
    <p>Likewise, if I work in a small team, we decide our
    internal operations, etc., again within the bounds of
    fulfilling our team assignments. That is, within the bounds
    set by our overarching responsibilities, and the constraint
    that we not disrupt others' activities, etc., we have
    essentially dictatorial say over our group. But, we do not
    have a dictator, but instead divide up the decision-making
    responsibilities within our team democratically. There are,
    of course, many ways this could be done. </p>
    <p>The additional constraint, in both cases, me alone and me
    in a team, is that our choices have to be within the broad
    value norms that guide the economy, and they have to be in
    tune with not having deleterious affects on others (since, if they
    do, those others will gain a say and intervene). </p>
    <p>So what do we have? It seems that workplace democracy
    implies having layers of decision making influence including
    individuals, teams, work groups, maybe sections of the work
    place or divisions, the whole place, and then more broadly,
    the industry. Each of these layers or levels would operate in context of
    decisions at a higher level and in respect of the
    implications for lower levels. We can call the larger units
    councils, the smaller ones teams and individuals. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is there any difference between workplace and polity
            that justifies a different decision making attitude regarding
            each? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't see one, other than the exigencies of the
    particular types of decision. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the difference between utilizing expertise
            and employing hierarchy regarding workplace decisions and
            what attitude do you have to each? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The difference is that in one case we are doing something
    productive with no necessary deleterious moral impact (taking
    account of specialized knowledge or skill) and in the other
    case we are doing something often not productive and in any
    event always engendering deleterious effects (using fixed hierarchies). </p>
    <p>There is a difference between consulting an expert, or
    having an expert examine circumstances and propose options
    with accompanying assessments of implications--and letting
    the expert make decisions. I need someone to tell me about
    the implications of using lead paint. But I can decide for or
    against using it, based on that special information. Same for
    nuclear power. Same for most anything. So in a workplace
    there will frequently be cause for reports and commentary
    from people with special knowledge or who have specially investigated
    a question, but then the decision can be taken in light of
    that information, by all affected. </p>
    <p>Indeed, the principle of paying attention to expert
    knowledge leads inexorably away from depending on experts for
    decision-making. In fact, since I am the world's foremost
    expert on my preferences, you on yours, and since a decision is
    supposed to account for our preferences proportionately, by
    the criteria of paying attention to expert knowledge when it
    is relevant, we must be involved proportionately in decisions
    that need to account for our preferences. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How should decisions over global workplace issues be
            arrived at and settled on? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The word global here implies to me that these are the
    decisions that affect the whole workplace, and everyone in it.
    I should think these would generally be concerns about broad
    policy, to be decided by a vote (with, perhaps, some special
    requirements about what is necessary for a victory--thus 50+%
    or 60% or 75% or unanimous...) of the whole workplace
    council. </p>
    <p>Could some workplaces, or all of them, sometimes
    incorporate delegation of decision making about some matters--yes,
    I don't see why not, if it is consistent with guiding values
    and efficient or otherwise desirable to take this approach. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What about implementation of decisions concerning the
            work of a team or other group? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Save insofar as some choice might have impact on others,
    beyond the obvious issue of getting their job done, I should
    think this would be a matter for the group or team in
    question. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What about how you do your work at your work station,
            or desk, or assembly site, or whatever? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again, save for the impact that some strange choices might
    have on others, it would seem that this decision generally
    rests with me. I might need to coordinate with my work mates
    in some cases, of course, but generally my personal work
    choices within the norms and goals of my job complex, in how to
    fulfill my responsibilities, impact mostly on me. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What would be the arguments against what you have
            proposed, offered by capitalists, offered by coordinators
            (managers), offered by some workers? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't want to answer this too fully, as we will deal
    with these matters more later, or whenever people in class bring
    up worries (which I wish there was more of). But I can
    imagine critics saying (a) people don't have the ability for this
    level of involvement, (b) teaching people would be too expensive
    and draining, (c) people don't want this level of involvement
    and democracy, (d) it would be inefficient lacking the
    orderlyness of more command-based models, (e) the meetings
    would take too long. Indeed these points have all been raised publicly, in
    reviews of parecon presentations, and also in the parecon
    forum here on LBBS. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>And how do you refute these arguments? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think this will emerge in coming sessions&#151;but in
    every case there are two issues: is what we are seeking consistent
    with our guiding values and is the critique therefore of
    those values...in which case we defend them, or are the values
    accepted and the criticism is that we are wrong in thinking
    that our choice of elaborating balanced job complexes is in
    accord with them, in which case we indeed discuss the logic
    and implications of job structures and their implementation. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suppose you have one person, one vote, and majority
            rule. Plus full opportunity for discussion. Do you thereby
            automatically have desirable democracy and
            participation? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>No. Because I only have an equal say over my own
    circumstances as you and everyone else in the workplace, even
    if we are talking about just how I will organize my tasks
    over the course of my work day, and even if the choice has no
    effect on anyone but me. The decision making influence is
    off, and also it makes no sense to discuss such matters at
    length. I don't want to hear anyone else's view, save as a
    kind of advisory or consultation that I may seek, much less
    do I want to have to debate other people about when I get to
    go to the water fountain, or what order I do my tasks in, or
    whatever else, unless it impacts on them or is thought to
    violate some socially agreed norms. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have a formally desirable structure, might you
            still have, in practice, undemocratic dynamics? Why? What
            could be done about it? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By all means. Suppose we have one-person one vote for
    broad encompassing policy decisions that affect everyone more
    or less equally&#151;a perfectly reasonable choice. But
    suppose when we get together to have our session discussing
    these matters a very few people have the information needed to even
    have an opinion, and also have the skills and disposition
    required for developing and arguing for an agenda, and the
    rest of us don't know anything we aren't told, and moreover
    have neither the disposition nor the skills to create or
    evaluate opposed agendas. And suppose the division of the whole group
    into these sectors always comes out the same, with the same
    people in respective positions. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>In the discussion we can say without much doubt that the
    few who have knowledge and skills and disposition to adjudicate,
    create options, evaluate them, and make decisions, will
    dominate. In every vote, as they vote, so too will the rest
    of us. The democracy is only formal because underneath it
    there is a very real hierarchy of influence and power. Of
    course, such a hierarchy will soon act to entrench and reward
    itself, and to institutionalize the imbalance of power even
    more forcefully, on grounds of the deservingness and needs of
    those at the top relative to those at the bottom, but,
    nonetheless one can imagine the hierarchy's presence even in
    a system with formally democratic structures. </p>
    <p>It seems the only thing we can do to ward off this type
    compromise of our decision--making structures is to make sure
    that by both schooling and on-the-job effects everyone is
    empowered sufficiently so that the formal democracy
    inevitably becomes actualized in a truly participatory
    framework. We must avoid having jobs whose character is such
    that people in different jobs are markedly differently empowered
    by them. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How much can we sensibly ask from our institutional
            choices? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Quite a bit, I think. We can demand that they not impose
    modes of behavior, or calculation, or interaction, or divisions
    of power or status or means, contrary to the values we hold.
    And then we can go a step further and demand that they not
    only function consistently with those values and not subvert them,
    but that working within our chosen institutions actually
    promotes personality, awareness, skills, knowledge, etc. and
    interests, that facilitate pursuit of those values. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a balanced job complex? What are the
            arguments for having them? What arguments can you
            raise against having them? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A balanced job complex (BJC) is a combination of tasks
    such that the overall quality of work and overall empowerment
    characteristics of the total job are equilibrated to those of
    other jobs. There is one proviso&#151;which we haven't yet
    spoken much about. If it is OK with work mates, if it fits
    the production requirements of one's firm, etc., one can
    trade a bit (either working longer with more income, or less
    long with less income, or perhaps picking up some extra
    onerous work again, to earn extra income, while someone else
    is doing somewhat less of the onerous work, earning somewhat less
    income). Trades are not permitted that disrupt equilibration
    of empowerment effects. Thus, the full definition of balanced
    job complexes comes out empowerment is balanced among job assignments
    throughout the economy. Quality of work is balanced, with the
    possibility of deviations up or down from the average, offset
    by countervailing income changes. </p>
    <p>The arguments in favor of BJC are that they are the best
    possible choice of how to combine tasks into jobs if we are
    concerned that there be an equitable allocation of desirable
    and not-so-desirable and downright undesirable work effects
    (conditions plus income), and an equitable allocation of empowerment implications
    of jobs for workers doing them to allow and promote truly democratic decision
    making by all. </p>
    <p>The most frequently raised arguments against BJC are: they
    oppress the highly knowledgeable or highly skilled by forcing
    them to spend some time in mundane work; they misutilize
    training and skills by having people waste these attributes
    by working at tasks that don't need their accumulated ability/training;
    they require people to struggle to work at a level they are
    not able to, demanding of people participation and
    involvement beyond their ken; they require too much schooling
    for too many people; they are hard to design and to
    continually update. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the refutation of arguments against balancing
            job complexes, and which way do you lean? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What the hell, I think I will answer these with my true
    unabashed unedited unalloyed (is that a word) sentiments. . </p>
    <ul>
        <li>BJCS oppress the highly knowledgeable or highly
            skilled by forcing them to spend some time in mundane work. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tough. </p>
    <p>That is to say, any society has a certain amount of
    onerous, dangerous, tedious&#151;or otherwise not preferred
    work. Now why the hell should this be disproportionately done
    by some people while others enjoy better work conditions? </p>
    <p>Do we oppress a slave owner by changing to a situation in
    which owning slaves is no longer permitted? We take away an
    advantage and an option, to be sure. But to call this
    oppression reveals much... </p>
    <p>Do we oppress a set of people previously able to work at
    only desirable tasks if we establish the norm that everyone
    has to do their fair share of onerous tasks? We take away an
    advantage and an option, to be sure. Doesn't calling this
    oppression reveal much... </p>
    <p>It is not oppressive, in short, that person a has to do
    their fair share. It is oppressive, instead, whenever person
    b must do a disproportionately great share of something
    undesirable so that person a can do less than a fair share. </p>
    <p>The argument that the person currently avoiding these job
    tasks (by virtue of being a doctor, lawyer, or holding some
    other coordinator like role, or perhaps by being a top level
    professional athlete, etc.) is being oppressed by having
    their advantages taken back to improve the situation of those
    who truly have been oppressed, is rubbish. It wouldn't be
    worthy of discussion, it is so obviously grotesque in its
    assumptions, but for the fact that we live in a society in
    which the grotesque has become enshrined as common sense gospel... </p>
    <p>There will be a time in the future when this type argument
    about BJCS will appear to people just as horrid as arguments
    that abolition oppressed slave owners appears to us now. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>BJCS misutilize great training and skills by having
            people with these wasting their time working at tasks
            that don't need all this ability/training. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>First off, once everybody has training, there is no way to
    avoid that trained people will be sometimes doing things that
    do not require their learned skills, or full talents. So, the
    real question becomes, in some sense, do we have everyone
    develop, or do we develop only enough people so that no resources are
    spent on development that does not, in turn, get utilized at
    full capacity in production. </p>
    <p>Put this way, it makes sense to curtail education,
    training, etc. to the minimum level called for to complete
    desired production, if (a) education, training, etc. is
    onerous and not pleasant in its own right, and (b) if
    education, training, etc., has no benefits that transcend the
    implications for economic output (or, in some economies,
    profit). The underlying assumptions necessary for the complaint
    to even register as remotely sensible are therefore, to me, truly disgusting... </p>
    <p>As a parallel, suppose someone said society should only
    feed people the amount necessary for them to work at the rate
    that their productive role in society (established by some
    elite, no less) requires (which, was, indeed, the notion
    predominant among capitalists before considerable labor
    struggle forced a different approach). With the exception of
    those at the top, the assumption is that people work, eat,
    and do some other irrelevant nonsense of no account, and
    should get no more from society (whether it be food or education
    or leisure, etc.) than is needed to carry out those two
    critical functions. </p>
    <p>But that is only one problem with the complaint. Another
    reply might be: Yeah, sure. Causing, say, 20 percent of the
    population to pick up its fair share of onerous and
    non-empowering work may perhaps utilize their stored up skills,
    training, and talents less than if we didn't require that
    onerous work of them (though this assumes (a) that the people
    in question are utilizing their skills for full workdays and
    work weeks before such a change, which is a big (and in our
    society false assumption), and (b) also ignores the extent to
    which these people are actually currently utilizing these
    stored traits in socially useless or destructive ways that
    are part and parcel of maintaining their advantages in the first
    place). </p>
    <p>But, give them the claim. Give them that these folks, if
    we don't have BJCS, will do only socially valuable work and
    will do it every hour and day they work, with no stretches of
    idleness, long lunches, golf trips, etc. What about the other
    80% or so of the population? Those who would be freed to
    develop their capacities and abilities and to put them to use
    if the 20 percent did their fair share of onerous and not
    empowering work? To take this objection to bjcs as a serious
    argument we have to believe that (a) each person in the 20%
    will be, on average, four times more productive than each person
    in the 80%, plus additional to make up for use of the 20%
    enforcing their own dominance, keeping the rest passive and
    ruled, etc. etc. </p>
    <p>It is utter nonsense and to even think it, it seems to me,
    again reveals underlying attitudes that are not too pretty...and
    that we ought to be uncovering and removing from our
    consciousness. </p>
    <p>But suppose for a minute that the distribution of
    potentials among people, the costs of training, the nature of contemporary
    job tasks, etc., made the claim valid. The 20 percent would
    six times more productive per hour, on average, than the 80
    percent, even with each constituency fully developing its skills
    and capacities. Even with this outrageous assumption, still
    regarding bjcs, for a person with an iota of moral
    sensibility, it wouldn't matter. Because attaining classlessness,
    equity, etc., so much offsets in worth any conceivable difference
    in productivity, were such a difference to actually exist in the
    first place. So, again, the complaint reflects not only a
    jaundiced view about what people in different constituencies
    can and can't do, even under ideal circumstances, it also reflects
    a jaundiced view of what matters in life, it seems to me. </p>
    <p>Finally, the real productivity effect of instituting BCJS,
    would be an immense gain, especially if we are talking about
    the utilization of productive possibilities for creating
    things that are actually of social value. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>BJCS require people to struggle to work at a level
            they are not able to, demanding of people participation and
            involvement beyond their ken . </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I answer this plaint when it is offered by critics of
    parecon, patiently and without rancor, because I suppose I think
    that is civil and tactically right if the goal is to actually
    communicate and not affront people into resistance, but to be
    out front about my real feelings, which is what I am trying
    to do in this answer, I find this complaint almost too
    repulsive to reply to. Yeah, sure. Most people are genetically
    incapable of the immense degree of genius associated with
    making decisions about economic matters, exercising self management,
    assessing diverse information and evidence, in a field of
    their choosing, in a congenial environment, etc. etc. Who
    would this be? This person who would be crushed by the weight
    of having to actually take responsibility for their own life? </p>
    <p>The same person who is a master of NBA strategy and
    statistics on the weekend even though now having to spend 50
    hours a week on a mind-deadening assembly line, perhaps? Or
    the doctor or lawyer who despite immense education and huge
    tracts of time for reading, etc., is self deceptive and ignorant
    enough to believe that the U.S. was in Vietnam to free the Vietnamese
    to live a better life? </p>
    <p>The housewife now raising three kids and dealing with low
    budget shopping and the juggling of countless decisions and
    demands, while fending off all sorts of patriarchal
    incursions and attacks on her dignity and intelligence, or the
    plant manager or engineer who has had endless years of
    schooling and who still has ample time for study but who
    nonetheless thinks blacks are inferior or that technology is
    chosen on purely objective productivity grounds... </p>
    <p>And so on. </p>
    <p>You know, a rather more accurate take on the situation, I
    think, is that in our society, most often, garbage rises...and
    so the real question is whether those now enjoying great
    advantages could ever manage to undo their socialization and
    lunatic value structures and belief systems to function in a humane
    and responsible fashion. I think yes, but this is at least a
    plausible concern... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>BJCS require too much schooling for too many people . </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is another good one. We might reply by asking, what
    is the alternative approach that this person must prefer? We
    have only so many educational resources in any society. What
    should we do with them? Suppose we use the criteria that we
    ought to utilize them where they will have the largest impact on
    output, a criteria that this critic will employ whenever it
    suits him or her. If the product is schooling, meaning
    increased levels of competence and knowledge, then surely
    with the exception of pathological cases, to use the resources
    to advance those who have least ability to teach themselves, or
    least prior learning, would be optimal. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Second, how can one even mouth the idea that society ought
    to give people less schooling or that it is educating too
    many people...supposing that one believes that humans have
    every right to develop and utilize their talents and capacities
    to the fullest, whatever that may turn out to be? Or
    supposing that one believes in equity, democracy, etc. </p>
    <p>In other words, under the surface all these types of
    objections strike me in more or less the same way that I imagine
    analogous questions of an advocate of the abolition of
    slavery, or, say, foot binding, struck them... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>BJCS are hard to design and continually update. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This objection is fair and reasonable, to my thinking. Any
    proposal has to be implementable, to be worth pursuing in any
    detail. If it is simply unworkable, ten regardless of
    virtues, it has to be dumped. Still, bcjs would have to be awfully
    hard to design and maintain and upgrade for them to be a bad idea, given
    the tremendous virtues they have. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless, with even a little tiny bit of thought, it
    seems to me obvious that this complaint too has no basis. OK, it
    is easier to design homogenous job complexes, I suppose. But
    marginally so. Because once you categorize tasks as being
    comparable to one another, and have a bunch of such categories,
    (and this is a prerequisite for having homogenous complexes),
    now creating a balanced job complex is merely a matter of
    taking tasks from various categories instead of taking them
    from only one, while (and this is presumably supposed to be
    the overwhelmingly hard part) being sure (a) they can be handled
    in a smooth and sensible fashion, which is necessary in both
    events, and (b) that the mix you choose is average. </p>
    <p>And as far as maintaining the arrangement once it exists:
    in either case the advent of new tasks or new social arrangements
    means there is a need to redefine things. </p>
    <p>But the critical and oh so obvious point were we not all
    wearing what might be called class or to be nicer familiarity
    blinders, is that with hierarchical job complexes you need a
    vast store of repressive mechanisms to keep those below in
    line, which requires great attention and struggle, perverting relationships
    throughout society, misutilizing resources and energies, etc. Whereas
    with balanced job complexes, maintaining the system requires none of
    this. </p>
    <p>That is, if one is on the wavelength to raise the issue of
    maintainability, if one cannot see that bjcs (once they exist and
    have been in place for a time) are far less difficult to
    maintain, one is, I think, simply blind to the existence of class difference
    and class struggle. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How would your job change if your work institution
            were to balance job complexes internally? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Not at all. Unless, of course, we just decided to
    rearrange, for variety or whatever. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do you think it would change if complexes were
            then also balanced across all workplace, with the economy
            as it is, other than this change? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think I would wind up having to do some onerous or
    tedious work outside, to balance off... On the other hand, given
    the hours I work, there might be some gains as well. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What would be the effect of introducing balanced job
            complexes into your workplace, now? What about as part
            of a national program that included retraining, etc.? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>They are here. But, to be honest, their value is modest
    because (a) we have such a small staff at <i>Z Magazine</i>
    (only 3) and such a minute staff at LBBS/LOLU (only 1). </p>
    <p>On the other hand, after my years at <i>Z</i> and SEP, I
    think I would last about five minutes in a typical workplace. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What would be the implication of having balanced job
            complexes in your workplace for the implementation of
            new technologies and other innovations? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have BJCS. As a result our criteria for changing
    techniques, organization, or getting new software, etc., are
    a comparison of the positive impact of the change on the
    nature of the work we have to do, or the speed with which we can
    do it, or on the quality of it, with the cost of implementing the
    change and any costs re nature of work, speed of it, or
    quality of it... </p>
    <p>The problem is, since most innovations depend on the
    outside world, for example Microsoft, etc., there are limits on
    what our different values can accomplish. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the relationship between having balanced job
            complexes in a good economy, and the process of deciding
            on investments, new technologies, etc.? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because everyone is at a balanced job complex, if there is
    an innovation in some workplace, or industry, or whatever,
    its impact is not confined to that site. Rather, if the
    quality of tasks at that site change for the better, there is
    a tiny overall improvement in average job complex throughout
    society. Everyone who works benefits to that degree. As a
    result everyone has the same interest when assessing possible
    technological or organizational innovations. Implement those
    innovations that have the largest and most desirable effects
    on output per effort and sacrifice, and/or on the quality of
    the societal average job complex. </p>
    <p>It is interesting to try to figure out what this actually
    means in practice, and what a flexible and sane implementation
    of the idea would mean in terms of how changes occur and how
    balancing happens. You might want to pursue that line of
    reasoning... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does having balanced job complexes oppress anyone, or
            reduce the well being of anyone, as compared to having
            more traditional job arrangements? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As with any question like this (replace the phrase
    &#147;having balanced job complexes&#148; with
    &#147;eliminating sexism&#148; or &#147;eliminating
    racism&#148; or whatever else) there are two angles to view
    it from. What we think. And what the person who is in the
    position of losing the advantage is most likely to
    think/feel. </p>
    <p>Regarding the former, I think that the life situation of
    the person who is now free from onerous work may improve somewhat,
    on balance, from the switch that will cause them to have to
    do their share, on the one hand, but free them from a degree
    of guilt, etc., on the other, as well from the other ills associated with
    class division. But I wouldn't want to exaggerate this. A
    person who is now, let us say, a professor at an elite
    school, who earns say $80,000 to $100,000 a year, who has a
    congenial work environment and who has huge recourses at
    their disposal and who has minimal work responsibilities that aren't
    pretty much what the person would most like to be doing with
    their time in any event, really does have something to
    lose--in having to do a fair share of onerous and non-empowering
    work, and in having to have a fair income, etc. And, yes,
    there are gains as well, very real and important ones. But... </p>
    <p>Now, as to what this person is likely to feel and how they
    are likely to react, I think that until there is a massive movement
    from below, and until the prospects of that movement winning
    are evident, those with advantages will give very little
    attention to the benefits that they will garner from change,
    but will focus instead on the disruption of their lives, the
    losses they will suffer, etc. Yes, there will be many welcome
    exceptions. But this seems to me to be the likely general
    reaction... </p>
    <p>And it raises an important strategic issue, which people
    might wish to begin to think about. Suppose, for the sake of
    the point, we think in terms of only working class,
    coordinator class, and capitalist class. Is the best way to improve
    life significantly in the foreseeable future to seek a goal
    that will alienate only capitalists, or one that will also
    alienate many many in the coordinator class, or even aspiring
    to it? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you like the idea of job complexes, how would you
            reply to someone saying that they are unfair to very brilliant
            people, or impose too much responsibility on many
            people who won't want it? Answered above. </li>
        <li>Do you have any idea at all what the organizational
            structure is, what the internal values are, etc. etc.
            of political projects and institutions that you relate
            to, support, etc.? Why do you think you don't,
            assuming that is the case? If you find the idea of
            balanced job complexes righteous and valid, or at
            least plausibly so, I wonder if you could hazard a
            guess as to why they are not a widely discussed
            programmatic aim among leftists... </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I know the structure of those I am involved with, or that
    I have investigated. I believe the structure of most left organizations
    is not common knowledge, not something they make known
    publicly, and discuss and debate, for the obvious reason that
    it is nothing to brag about, and is, instead, in most instances
    little different from the structures that many of their
    verbal flourishes attack as despicable. </p>
    <p>I believe BJCS are not a widely discussed aim among
    leftists because what is widely discussed on the left is that which
    appears in left publications, on left shows, in left
    teach-ins, or is promulgated by highly visible left figures. These, we
    can deduce, are not pushing this notion. I think it is easy
    to figure out why given the backgrounds and social
    circumstances of the people involved... </p>
    <p>. </p>
    <h2>Consumption Institutions </h2>
    <p>I am hell bent on getting you all to participate in
    thinking conceptually. Also, at this point, those who have
    been keeping up should be pretty well prepared to do so, I
    think. As to the rest, there is no time like the present to
    begin getting the most out of the course. So, regarding
    consumption. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>(1) What is an externality of a consumption choice
            you may make, or action you may undertake? (In other words,
            an aspect that affects people beyond the buyer and
            seller.) (2) What does the existence of consumption externalities
            imply about the process of arriving at consumption decisions
            given the desire for efficiency and given the desire
            for self management? </li>
        <li>Are there different levels of consumption
            decision-making unit, as with separate workers, work teams, plants,
            industries, etc. If so, what implications does this
            have for how consumption should be undertaken? </li>
        <li>What determines, should determine, the volume of
            stuff I can consume in a year? </li>
        <li>What do I have to think about to decide what I want
            to consume? </li>
        <li>Can I just determine my preferences, or must they be
            agreed to by others? If so, who? </li>
        <li>Can I consume stuff that is going to hurt others, if
            not, what stops me from doing so? Suppose I am a
            drunk, for example? </li>
        <li>What protects personal rights and privacy of the
            consumer? What allows collective impact? </li>
        <li>How do you react to the following norms: (1) To
            guarantee equity there must be a measure of average
            per capita consumption for individuals, neighborhoods,
            regions, and states, and there must be a way to
            ensure that individuals, neighborhoods, regions, and
            state don't consume above the average amounts unless
            they receive permission from others to do so. Requests
            for goods and services that place an above average burden
            on society's productive potentials may be rejected by
            consumer councils on equity grounds. (2) To guarantee
            the right to privacy and personal control of one's
            purchases, average- and below-average requests must
            not be subject to aggressive oversight, and should
            they want to suffer the losses involved in forsaking the
            benefits of collective consumption goods, individuals
            must be free to act as their own one-person consumption councils. </li>
        <li>Should it be possible to borrow and save? What would
            it mean in practice? </li>
        <li>Should one be able to increase one's consumption
            bundle above the social average? If so, how? </li>
        <li>What should be the relation between collective
            consumption requests and individual ones? </li>
        <li>What about someone who can't work, do they consume?
            At what level? </li>
        <li>What reasons might influence your choice of a local
            area to live, that is, of a local consumption collective
            to become part of? </li>
        <li>Describe what you think might be a sane and orderly
            and sensible routine that a person in a good economy might
            go through to plan their consumption for a year, then
            to update it periodically in light of changed preferences,
            circumstances, expectations, etc. </li>
        <li>Finally, please comment on the following passage from
            Ursula Leguin's The Dispossessed: </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Saemtenevia Prospect was two miles long, and it was
        a solid mass of things to buy, things for sale. Coats,
        dresses, gowns, robes, trousers, breeches, shirts,
        umbrellas, clothes to wear while sleeping, while
        swimming, while playing games, while at an afternoon
        party, while at an evening theatre, while riding horses,
        gardening, receiving guests, boating, dining, hunting--all
        different, all in hundreds of different cuts, styles, colors,
        textures, materials. Perfumes, clocks, lamps, statues, cosmetics,
        candles, pictures, cameras, hassocks, jewels, carpets, toothpicks,
        calendars, a baby's teeth rattle of platinum with a handle
        of rock crystal, an electrical machine to sharpen pencils, a wristwatch
        with diamond numerals, figurines and souvenir and
        kickshaws and mementos and gewgaws and bric-a-brac, everything
        either useless to begin with or ornamented so as to disguise its
        use; acres of luxuries, acres of excrement. After one block,
        Shevek had felt utterly exhausted. He could not look any more.
        He wanted to hide his eyes. But to Shevek the strangest thing
        about the nightmare street was that none of the millions
        of things for sale were made there. They were only sold
        there. Where were the workmen, the miners, the weavers,
        the chemists, the carvers, the dyers, the designers, the
        machinists, where were the hands, the people who made?
        Out of sight, somewhere else. Behind walls. All the
        people in all the shops were either buyers or sellers.
        They had no relation to the things but that of possessions.
        How was he to know what a goods' production entailed? How
        could they expect him to decide if he wanted something?
        The whole experience was totally bewildering. Were his
        hosts in this strange world, the
        &#147;shoppers&#148;&#148; of A-lo, really capable of
        such daily acts of social irresponsibility?</i> </p>

    <p>In this Lecture, 8, as in past ones, I would like to begin
    by presenting my answers to questions raised last time. Then
    we can move on to the allocation institutions discussion. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 7 Questions </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What is an externality of a consumption choice you
            may make, or action you may undertake? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any effect of the choice or action whose consequences are
    felt by other than solely the buyer and/or seller. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does the existence of consumption externalities
            imply about the process of arriving at consumption decisions
            given the desire for efficiency and given the desire
            for self management? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The people affected by outcomes are supposed to be
    proportionately involved in making them. If there is an externality
    to some economic choice, then the decision must be made with
    input from people other than just the buyer and seller. </p>
    <p>If this is not done, then of course there will be no
    participatory self management. But, likewise, if it is not
    done decisions may be made which have harmful effects on
    non-buyers and sellers that are much greater than any positive
    effects buyers or sellers may enjoy. In other words, from the
    broader perspective of all people's well being and
    development, many choices that buyers and sellers make in light
    of only effects on themselves may be less than optimal, or
    even horrible. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are there different levels of consumption decision-
            making unit, as with separate workers, work teams, plants,
            industries, etc.? If so, what implications does this
            have for how consumption should be undertaken? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It seems to me that there is the individual, the smallest
    living unit, the next larger size living unit (perhaps extended
    family or commune, or whatever), the neighborhood, county,
    etc. </p>
    <p>There are certain consumption choices that are primarily
    relevant to a single actor, or some larger collective. The decision
    process needs to reflect this, both in terms of the impact we
    have on choices, and in terms of charging people properly for
    their fair share of costs. </p>
    <p>So, if my family gets a lot of collective goods, or my
    commune, each member is going to be charged a fair share, and
    have less for individual goods. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What determines, should determine, the volume of
            stuff I can consume in a year? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would say the overall social product, and then how much
    above or below the average outlay of effort and sacrifice I
    have contributed to its creation&#151;unless I have some good
    reason why I couldn't contribute, in which case I get the average
    by right, or some compelling reason why I should get more than average,
    in which case, if granted, I get that. </p>
    <p>What do I have to think about to decide what I want to
    consume? </p>
    <p>Certainly my own preferences. But also the effects of my
    choices on other people, both immediately around me, and also
    at a distance, such as the people who will have to produce
    what I seek to consume. Partly this is straight solidarity
    and empathy. Partly it is also self-interest. It is pointless
    for me to say I want some commodity that involves onerous
    work, if I really don't care for it all that much. Why? It
    reduces overall work quality for everyone, myself included,
    to behave in such a way. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can I just determine my preferences, or must they be
            agreed to by others? If so, who? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Of course I determine my preferences. Who the hell else
    would? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can I consume stuff that is going to hurt others, if
            not, what stops me from doing so? Suppose I am a
            drunk, for example. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a very tricky matter. Everybody's will is manifest
    in the prices of items, via the social planning process. </p>
    <p>Likewise, workers have a proportionate say in what they
    will do, etc. </p>
    <p>But a lot of this happens at the level of gross supply and
    demand, and people's individual reactions to it. What might
    be a perfectly sensible order for Vodka, for the country, for
    a region, even for a local neighborhood or commune, could conceal
    a horrible order for some individual. </p>
    <p>What happens? </p>
    <p>Now we have two competing values at stake. Privacy and
    proportionate self management. I have a right to privacy
    regarding my desires, etc. But my community has a right to
    step in when my personal consumption choices are threatening
    the community or some or all of its members. </p>
    <p>Suppose I like manufacturing bombs as a hobby, or, at a
    lesser level, drinking myself into a violent state. </p>
    <p>What Robin and I came up with when we were thinking about
    parecon and asking just these types of questions was that
    individuals could submit their consumption proposals
    anonymously. This way the proposals are seen, and can be
    challenged, yet the person's privacy isn't abridged. More,
    except in the most extreme of cases, though an individual's
    private choices of how to spend their budget can be challenged,
    if can't be abridged. For the latter degree of intervention,
    there would have to be special cause, etc. </p>
    <p>So the answer is kind of mixed. If what I want is
    produced, and available, and I have sufficient budget to
    afford it (at its real price), I can have it. But, my neighbors,
    etc., can also challenge consumption proposals that seem anti-social.
    And, in special cases, even intercede. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What protects personal rights and the privacy of the
            consumer? What allows collective impact? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, with our answer above, this is pretty clear,
    anonymity and freedom to spend up to your budget level as you choose,
    on the one hand, and the right to intercession, on the other. </p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>How do you react to the following norms: To guarantee
            equity there must be a measure of average per capita consumption
            for individuals, neighborhoods, regions, and states,
            and there must be a way to ensure that individuals,
            neighborhoods, regions, and state don't consume above the average
            amounts unless they receive permission from others to
            do so. Requests for goods and services that place an
            above average burden on society's productive
            potentials may be rejected by consumer councils on equity
            grounds. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This seems fair to me, obviously. But let me throw in a
    thought provoking wrinkle. </p>
    <p>Supposing we want equal outcomes, not in some crass
    material sense, but in the sense of equal personal fulfillment
    and development for all. Should everyone have the same
    budget? If I am bigger, I need more food. If I get my fulfillment
    and pleasure from playing violin, and you from playing harmonica, why
    do I have to pay more of my total income for the same outcome (fulfillment
    and pleasure) that you pay less for. </p>
    <p>What do people think about this fly in the ointment? Is
    it, or isn't it. </p>
    <p>To guarantee the right to privacy and personal control of
    one's purchases, average- and below-average requests must not
    be subject to aggressive oversight, and should they want to
    suffer the losses involved in forsaking the benefits of
    collective consumption goods, individuals must be free to act
    as their own one-person consumption councils. </p>
    <p>In other words, as a last resort, you vote with your feet.
    If you don't like parecon, don't take its offerings, don't abide
    its limitations, either in part, or in full. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should it be possible to borrow and save? What would
            it mean in practice? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I can't see any problem with allowing this. To think there
    needs to be equity every minute is a fetish, to my mind, and
    grossly inflexible, whether we are talking about roles or
    income. </p>
    <p>So why shouldn't I be able to spend some of next year's
    income earlier, or to save some for the future, etc.? </p>
    <p>But this does introduce tricky problems. For any durable
    good I would ever buy, of course I would like to buy it now
    rather than later, to get the pleasure of its use for a
    longer time during my life. Well, everybody cannot do this. </p>
    <p>We can't all be working later for our hamburger today, to
    quote the meat eating bozo in <i>Popeye</i>. </p>
    <p>So something to think about is the exact norms and
    mechanisms of saving and borrowing. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Should one be able to increase one's consumption
            bundle above the social average? If so, how? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I exert more effort and give more of myself
    (sacrifice), sure, I ought to be able to receive more of the
    social product back in return. It is hard to see how anyone
    could do this to too great a degree, however. Suppose the average work
    week is 30 hours. Could someone manage to get 30 extra hours of
    labor at balanced job complexes consistently with everybody
    else's plans? Would anyone want this? I don't know, but I
    doubt it would cause any real problems for the system. If it
    would, however, then there would have to be norms about how
    much &#147;overtime&#148; people could work. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What should be the relation between collective
            consumption requests and individual ones? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Seems like the collective consumption requests that I
    benefit from, I in part pay for. Also, it makes little sense
    for me to arrive at individual requests before I know what my
    collective units are getting. It could easily change my situation
    and personal preferences. So it is entwined, in the budget
    sense, and I think the collective request is prior, in the
    planning sense. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What about someone who can't work, do they consume?
            At what level? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, what else, they starve? It seems to me that they get
    an average budget, that they can consume as they wish. </p>
    <p>In fact, the way I like to think of parecon is that
    everyone gets an average budget by right of being a person. </p>
    <p>Everyone also has a responsibility to work an average job
    complex an average length of time. The two things are separate
    at the level of right and responsibility, but linked at the
    level of &#147;amount.&#148; Anyone who wants to can, on top
    of this normal situation, petition for some more income, less
    work, or whatever. </p>
    <p>What determines whether the petition is granted? Partly
    its value and logic. Partly whether the person helps pay for
    its implementation by additional effort and sacrifice. </p>
    <p>This way labor and income are only operationally linked
    for the part that diverges from average... </p>
    <p>Comment on the following passage from Ursula Leguin's <i>The
    Dispossessed</i>&#133; </p>
    <p>What can I say. She understands things that 95 percent of
    professional economists are 100 percent oblivious too. But
    then, so does the average person on the street... Leguin
    does, however, say it better. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What reasons might influence your choice of a local
            area to live, that is, of a local consumption collective
            to become part of? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The personalities of people, of course, but also their
    collective goods preferences. Depending on my preferences I
    might like a group that spends a lot on musical instruments
    and practice rooms, or on an observatory and lab, or on one
    that has various kinds of athletic equipment, and so on... </p>
    <p>In other words, it make sense to choose where one lives on
    a variety of grounds including proximity to work, family and
    friends, climate, etc. etc., but also the collective goods
    preferences of people in various size living groups. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe what you think might be a sane and orderly
            and sensible routine that a person in a good economy might
            go through to plan their consumption for a year, then
            to update it periodically in light of changed preferences,
            circumstances, expectations, etc.? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm going to leave this one, for now. </p>

    <h2>Information and Allocation</h2>
    <p>This time I decided to use a more textual lecture, and to
    make it a slightly adapted version of Chapter Four from the
    book Robin and I wrote published by Princeton University
    Press. The chapter title is <i>Allocation</i>, and it is a statement
    of what participatory allocation is, written for professional economists.
    (There are a couple of related mathematical chapters too, but
    this chapter appears here essentially as it appeared there.)
    I think you will have little problem with the chapter but it
    will help to indicate the difference between a conversational
    lecture, and an effort to present similar content in a more
    precise fashion. These types of &#147;professional&#148;
    presentation actually have little to do with the process of
    conceptualizing vision, or analyses, for that matter. They
    are after the fact. In the rest of the lectures, I try to be
    more true to the kinds of thinking and procedures typical of
    conception, as compared to presentation. But this provides a
    good contrast, I think, and also does manage to present the allocation
    system in a succinct way. So&#133; </p>
    <p>Here we describe an alternative system of allocation,
    called decentralized participatory planning. The system permits
    consumers and workers councils to participate directly in
    formulating a plan and has strong egalitarian properties. Because
    workers and consumers councils propose and revise their own activities
    prior to initiating those activities, the planning process is
    a decentralized, social, iterative procedure. </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We consider specifying this procedure and analyzing
        its welfare theoretic properties our most important contribution
        to developing a libertarian economic vision (along with
        the idea of balanced job complexes, and its implications,
        I think I would add). The idea of &#147;associated
        producers&#148; democratically determining their own plan is
        no more original to us than the vision of workers and consumers
        councils. But whereas many before us have contributed to
        the theory of the internal workings of democratic
        councils, few have attempted to explain, in detail, how
        those councils might jointly settle on a plan. In fact, most
        economists agree no third procedure qualitatively different
        from markets and central planning exists, or, if there is
        another alternative, that it has not been articulated at
        a level permitting meaningful comparison with markets and
        central planning. </p>
        <p>Alec Nove, for example, threw down the gauntlet in
        unequivocal terms: &#147;I feel increasingly ill-disposed
        towards those who...substitute for hard thinking an image
        of a world in which there would be no economic problems
        at all (or where any problems that might arise would be
        handled smoothly by the `associated producers'... In a
        complex industrial economy the interrelation between its
        parts can be based in principle either on freely chosen
        negotiated contracts [i.e. markets], or on a system of
        binding instructions from planning offices [i.e. central
        planning]. There is no third way.&#148; Allen Buchanan posed the
        challenge in a somewhat more agnostic vein: &#147;It is
        impossible to show that a feasible non-market system at
        least approaches the productivity of the market unless
        (1) a rather well-developed theoretical model of the
        non-market system is available, and (2) it is
        demonstrated that a sufficiently productive approximation
        of the ideal system described in the theoretical model is practically possible.
        Unfortunately, [no one] has achieved even the first step--that
        of providing a theoretical model for a non-market system.&#148; </p>
        <p>In this chapter and the next two we present a rebuttal
        to Nove and a direct answer to Buchanan by providing a &#147;rather
        well-developed&#148; theoretical model of a decentralized planning
        procedure and offering a preliminary analysis of its
        efficiency properties as well as arguing that &#147;a
        sufficiently productive approximation of the ideal...system described
        in the theoretical model is practically possible,&#148;
        including description of a number of experiments through
        which other economists might sensibly test this claim. </p>
        <p>Participatory Information and Communication Our
        description of participatory workers and consumers
        councils (in prior chapters) assumed that the necessary
        information about their relations with others would be
        available. But what precisely do workers in a council
        need to know to regulate their production activity
        cognizant of the effects on themselves, other workers,
        and consumers? </p>
        <p>And what must consumers know to formulate their
        consumption requests in light of their own needs as well
        as the needs of other consumers and workers? </p>
        <p>Participatory workers must be able to weigh the gains
        from working less or employing less productive though more
        fulfilling techniques, against the consequent loss of consumer
        well-being. Participatory consumers need to be able to
        weigh the gains of a consumption request against the sacrifices required
        to produce it. Participatory workers must be able to
        distinguish an equitable work load from one that is too
        light or too heavy. And participatory consumers need to
        be able to distinguish reasonable consumption demands from
        ones that are unreasonable or overly modest. Finally, all
        actors must know the true social costs and benefits of
        things they demand or supply, that is, all the non-human
        and human, quantifiable and non-quantifiable consequences of
        their choices, if they are going to participate in
        informed collective self-management. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>First Communicative Tool: Prices</h3>
        <p>Prices providing accurate estimates of the full social
        costs and benefits of inputs and outputs are the most important
        quantitative communicative tools we use. They arise in
        the process of participatory planning and serve as guides
        to proposals and evaluations. And this is an important
        point. </p>
        <p>All too often theoretical economists view
        &#147;efficiency&#148; prices or &#147;shadow&#148; prices
        as quantitative measures that can be found via technical
        procedures. In the literature on central planning, for example,
        shadow prices arise as the solution to the dual of the primal
        planning problem that central planners &#147;solve.&#148;
        And in neoclassical literature on market systems, an
        equilibrium price vector is studied as something implied
        by preferences and technologies taken as givens. While
        these conceptions are useful in some regards, they are misleading
        as well. Real people's preferences arise in social communicative processes.
        Not only do results depend on what those processes are
        like, but the very preferences that lie at the basis of
        the results depend on the processes as well. So, without engaging
        in undue mystification, we should remember that estimates
        of social costs and benefits with any claim to accuracy
        must arise from social, communicative processes. The
        trick is to organize these processes so people have no incentives
        to dissimulate regarding their true desires, and all have
        equal opportunity to manifest their feelings. It is precisely
        because our participatory planning process is different
        from the flawed communicative processes of market and
        centrally planned allocation that the prices to which it
        gives rise will be different as well. </p>
        <p>In any case, prices are &#147;indicative&#148; during
        the planning process in the sense of indicating the best current estimates
        of final valuations. They are not binding but flexible in
        the sense that qualitative information provides important additional
        guidance. And they are not the product of competition or authoritarian
        determinations, but of social consultation and
        compromise. The idea is that qualitative information is
        necessary if quantitative indicators are to be kept as
        accurate as possible. But qualitative information is also necessary to
        develop workers' sensitivity to fellow workers'
        situations and everyone's understanding of the intricate
        tapestry of human relations that determines what we can and cannot
        consume or produce. So both to assure accuracy and to foster
        solidarity we need a continual, social resetting of
        prices in light of updated qualitative information about
        work lives and consumption activity. Thus, the cybernetic
        burden of a participatory allocation procedure is considerably
        greater than for non-participatory economies. </p>
        <p>Not only must a participatory economy generate and
        revise accurate quantitative measures of social costs and benefits
        in light of changing conditions, but it must communicate
        substantial qualitative information about others' conditions
        as well. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Second Communicative Tool: Measures of Work</h3>
        <p>As we explained earlier, job complexes are balanced in
        each workplace, and in plants with above average work conditions
        workers spend time doing more menial tasks elsewhere,
        while in plants with below average work conditions, people
        put time into more interesting pursuits elsewhere. </p>
        <p>For an individual to work more or less than the social
        average in a given period and not disrupt a humane
        balance of work, she or he need only diminish or increase
        her or his hours worked at all tasks in the same
        proportion. Then, each individual could receive from her
        or his workplace an indicator of average labor hours
        expended as an accurate indicator of work contributed. </p>
        <p>Over a sufficient period, whenever a person's
        indicator was high (or low) compared to the social average,
        the individual would have sacrificed more (or less) for
        the social good, and would be entitled to ask for proportionately more
        (or less) consumption in return. </p>
        <p>Unlike what emerges from the Marxist labor theory of
        value: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In our system job complexes are balanced by a
                real social evaluation, and </li>
            <li>Our &#147;hour counts&#148; serve only as
                guidelines for decisions since councils can grant exceptions
                for higher (or lower) consumption requests as conditions
                and needs warrant. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In short, participatory planning can obtain a
        reasonable first estimate of effort expended by counting labor
        hours because people's job complexes have been balanced. </p>
        <p>These estimates can then be revised in light of effort
        intensity ratings by one's work mates. In attempting to
        gain consumption flexibility, only unbalancing job
        complexes is prohibited. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Third Communicative Tool: Qualitative Activity</h3>
        <p>To guard against &#147;reductionist accounting&#148;
        each actor needs access to a list of everything that goes into
        producing goods directly and indirectly, and a description
        of what will be gained from consuming them. This means
        those who produce and consume particular goods must try
        to communicate the qualitative human effects that cannot
        be captured in quantitative indicators. This does not
        entail everyone writing Upton Sinclair length novels
        about their work and living conditions. It does mean
        generating concise accounts that substitute for the fact
        that not everyone can personally experience every circumstance. </p>
        <p>Of course, not every worker and consumer will use all
        this qualitative information in all calculations. But
        over time people will become familiar with the
        &#147;congealed&#148; material, human, and social components
        of products they use just as people are now familiar with the
        products themselves. In this way, everyone can more
        accurately assess the full effects of others' requests in
        a way that enhances solidarity. Both producers and
        consumers must therefore receive not only quantitative
        summaries of overall social costs and benefits, but detailed
        qualitative accounts as well. Only this will ensure that the human/social dimension
        of economic decision making is not lost and guarantee that
        summary price data remains as accurate as possible. </p>

    <h2>Allocation Organization</h2>
    <p>Every workplace and neighborhood consumers' council
    participates in the social, iterative procedure we call participatory
    planning. But besides workplace councils, we also have
    industry councils and regional federations of workers'
    councils. And besides neighborhood consumers ' councils, we also have
    ward, city, county, and state federations of consumers'
    councils as well as a national consumers' council. Moreover,
    in addition to all these councils and federations of
    councils, various facilitation boards assess collective
    proposals and large-scale investment projects, regional and industry
    boards assist workers changing places of employment, and
    household boards help individuals and families find
    membership in living units and neighborhoods. Finally, at
    every level of the economy facilitation boards help units
    revise proposals and search out the least disruptive ways of
    modifying plans in response to unforeseen circumstances. </p>
    <p>In our companion volume, <i>Looking Forward</i>, we
    provide comprehensive descriptions of planning institutions
    and procedures, including hypothetical case studies for
    particular kinds of workplaces and consumers' councils intended
    to illustrate the texture of participatory planning. </p>
    <p>Here we present a summary of results sufficient for
    theoretical purposes. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Participatory Planning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each consumption &#147;actor&#148; proposes a
            consumption plan. </li>
        <li>Individuals make proposals for private goods. </li>
        <li>Neighborhood councils make proposals that include
            approved requests for private goods as well as the neighborhood's
            collective consumption request. Higher level
            federations make proposals that include approved requests
            from member councils as well as the federation's collective consumption
            request. </li>
        <li>Similarly, each production &#147;actor&#148; proposes
            a production plan. Workplaces enumerate the inputs
            they want and outputs they will make available.
            Regional and industry federations aggregate proposals
            and keep track of excess supply and demand. </li>
        <li>Every actor at every level proposes its own plan,
            and, after receiving information regarding other
            actors' proposals and the response of other actors to
            its proposal, each actor makes a new proposal. </li>
        <li>As every actor &#147;bargains&#148; through
            successive &#147;iterations,&#148; the process converges. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Preparing First Proposals</h2>
    <p>The real world always has a &#147;just completed
    year.&#148; If production and consumption of the just completed
    year was recorded, we would have information about last
    year's plan for each actor. If the prices used to calculate social costs,
    benefits, and income last year were recorded, we have a set
    of &#147;indicative prices&#148; that could be used to begin
    this year's estimates as well. By storing last year's full plan
    in a central computer, access to relevant parts including
    indicative prices could be made available to all actors in
    the planning process. Additionally, each unit knows what its
    own proposals were in each iteration last year. </p>
    <p>So, how do workers' and consumers' councils plan. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>They access relevant data from last year. </li>
        <li>They receive information from facilitation boards
            estimating this year's probable changes in prices and income
            in light of existing knowledge of past investment
            decisions and changes in the labor force. </li>
        <li>They receive information from higher level production
            and consumption councils regarding long-term investment
            projects or collective consumption proposals already
            agreed to in previous plans that imply commitments
            for this year. </li>
        <li>By reviewing changes in their own proposals made
            during last year's planning they assess how much they had
            to scale down their consumption desires or their
            plans to improve the quality of work life, and look
            to see what increases in average income and
            improvements in the quality of average work complexes
            are projected this year over last. </li>
        <li>Using last year's final prices as indicators of
            social costs and benefits they develop a proposal for
            the coming year, not only enumerating what they want
            to consume or produce--and implicitly what they think society's total
            output should be--but also providing qualitative
            information about their reasons. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This does not mean units must specify how many units of
    every single good they need down to size, style, and color. </p>
    <p>Goods and services are grouped into classes accordingly as
    they are roughly interchangeable regarding the resources,
    intermediate goods, and labor required to make them. For
    planning purposes we need only request types, even though
    later everyone will pick an exact size, style, and color. Individuals
    present consumption requests to neighborhood councils where
    they are approved or disapproved. Once approved, individual consumption requests
    are summed and added to the neighborhood collective
    consumption request to become the neighborhood consumption
    proposal. These in turn are summed with consumption requests
    from other neighborhoods into ward proposals, which are
    summed along with consumption requests from other wards into city
    proposals. Having the next higher level council review, approve,
    or contest lower level requests until they are ready to be passed
    on saves a great deal of planning time. </p>
    <p>In the same way, a firm's iteration board provides all its
    workers with summaries of last year's production schedule,
    including what was initially proposed, changes made during
    planning iterations, and what was (finally) approved, as well
    as a prediction of this year's requests based on extrapolations
    from new demographic data and the trajectory of last year's iterations.
    Individual workers consider this information, discuss ideas
    for improving the quality of work life, and enter proposals
    which are averaged into the firm's first proposal for
    &#147;inputs&#148; and &#147;outputs.&#148; After some number
    of iterations, firm proposals are discussed, negotiated, and
    decided as a unit rather than each individual making his or
    her own proposal and these being averaged. </p>
    <p>Besides quantitative proposals for each production and
    consumption unit, a qualitative addenda including descriptions
    of changes in circumstances and conditions is also entered
    into the computerized planning system. At any point any
    council can access the data banks of any facilitation board
    and any other council. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Proceeding from One Proposal to Another</h2>
    <p>The first proposals are in. We have all answered how much
    we want to work and consume in light of our own presumably
    over-optimistic assessments of possibilities. </p>
    <p>Do the proposals constitute a plan, or must we have
    another round? To decide, it is only necessary to sum all proposals
    and compare total demand and total supply for every class of
    final good and service, intermediate good, and primary input.
    In a first iteration, where consumers propose in part a &#147;wish list&#148;
    and workers propose substantial improvements in their work
    lives, while some goods may be in excess supply, for most
    goods initial proposals should generate excess demand. In
    other words, initial proposals are not supposed to sum to a
    feasible plan. </p>
    <p>As the next step, every council receives new information
    indicating which goods are in excess supply or demand by what
    percentage, and how its proposal compares to those of other
    relevant units. Most important, iteration boards provide new
    estimates of indicative prices projected to equilibrate supply and
    demand. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>At this point, consumers reassess their requests in light
    of the new prices and most often &#147;shift&#148; their requests
    for goods in excess demand toward goods whose relative prices
    have fallen because they were in excess supply or less in
    excess demand than others. Consumers' councils whose overall requests were
    higher than average would also be under pressure to
    &#147;whittle down&#148; their requests in hopes of winning
    approval. Equity and efficiency emerge simultaneously. The
    need to win approval from other similar councils forces councils
    whose per capita consumption request is significantly above
    the social average to reduce their overall requests. But the
    need to reduce can be alleviated by substituting goods whose
    indicative prices have fallen for those whose prices have risen.
    Attention focuses on the degree to which units diverge from
    current and projected averages, and on whether their reasons
    for doing so are compelling. </p>
    <p>Similarly workers' councils whose ratios of social
    benefits of outputs to social costs of inputs were lower than average
    would come under pressure to increase either efficiency or
    effort, or to explain why the quantitative indicators are
    misleading in their particular case. Before increasing their
    work commitment, workers would try to substitute inputs whose
    indicative prices had fallen for inputs whose indicative
    prices had risen, and substitute outputs whose indicative
    prices had risen for outputs whose indicative prices had fallen. </p>
    <p>Each iteration yields a new set of proposed activities for
    all economic actors. Once summed, these yield new data
    regarding the status of each good and the average consumption
    per person and production &#147;benefit cost ratio&#148; per
    firm. All this allows calculation of new price projections
    and new predictions for average income and work, which in
    turn lead to modifications in proposals until excess demands
    are eliminated and a feasible plan is reached. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Flexible Updating</h2>
    <p>Converging and updating are related because both can
    benefit from algorithms that take advantage of the large scale
    of the planning process. Assume we have settled on a plan for
    the year. Why might we need to update it during the year, and
    how might this be done with least disruption. </p>
    <p>Consumers begin the year with a working plan including how
    much of different kinds of food, clothing, meals at restaurants,
    trips, books, records, and tickets to performances they will
    consume. What if someone wants to substitute one item for a
    slightly different one? Or what if she wants to delete or add
    entries? Or what if she changes her mind and wants to save or
    borrow more than planned? She belongs to a neighborhood
    consumers ' council which in turn belongs to a ward council, a
    city federation, and so on. Some changes will cancel out
    among all the consumers within the neighborhood, others will cancel
    out at the ward level, and so on. As long as adjustments by
    many consumers cancel at some consumption federation level,
    production plans need not change. Indeed, making adjustments
    without disrupting production plans is one function of
    consumer federation boards. </p>
    <p>But what happens if aggregate demand rises for some good?
    Suppose individuals record their consumption on &#147;credit
    card&#148; computers that automatically compare the
    percentage of annual requests &#147;drawn down&#148; with the fraction
    of the year that has passed, taking account of predictable irregularities
    such as birth dates and holidays. </p>
    <p>This data can be processed by planning terminals which
    communicate projected changes to relevant industry councils
    which in turn communicate changes to particular firms. The
    &#147;technology&#148; involved is little different from the
    now common system of computerized store inventories where
    cash register sales are automatically subtracted from
    inventory stocks. In any case, what would then happen is that consumer
    federations, industry councils, and individual work units
    would engage in a dialog to negotiate adjustments. Such dialogues
    may lead to work diminishing in some industries and increasing
    in others, including possible transfers of employees, but
    there need be no more moving about than in other types of
    economies. In any case, the need for workers to change jobs
    or increase or diminish work loads would be a factor considered
    in the dialogue over whether to meet changed demands. </p>
    <p>However, since each firm's activities have implications
    for other firms, if planned matches between supply and demand
    are calculated too closely, any change in demand could
    disrupt the whole economy. For this reason a &#147;taut&#148; plan
    would prove unnecessarily inconvenient since it would require
    excessive debating and moving. To avoid this and to simplify
    updating, the plan agreed to should include some excess
    supply for most goods. A practical knowledge of those
    industries most likely to be affected by non-averaging
    alterations would facilitate this type of &#147;slack
    planning.&#148; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Converging to a Plan</h2>
    <p>A little thought reveals that convergence can be a
    complicated matter. Adjusting indicative prices to reduce excess
    supplies and demands is more complicated in practice than in
    economists' theoretical models with all their convenient
    assumptions. For example, a product in excess demand in one iteration
    could overshoot equilibrium and be in excess supply in the
    next iteration as workers offer to produce more and consumers
    offer to request less in response to a price increase. Worse
    still, considering that each product's status affects the
    status of many others, progress in one industry could disrupt equilibrium
    in another. Theoreticians' solutions to these headaches always assume
    away the troublesome phenomena. Whether the issue is market equilibrium
    and stability or convergence of iterative planning
    procedures, it is well known that convexity and gross
    substitutability assumptions are good aspirin for these
    theoretical headaches. But simplifying assumptions are no aspirin
    at all for practitioners operating in the real world. </p>
    <p>To make our participatory planning procedure more
    efficient, specific economies will incorporate flexible rules that
    facilitate convergence in a reasonable time but do not unduly
    bias outcomes or subvert equity. Procedures can range from
    rote algorithms carried out by computer that take short cuts toward
    equilibrium, to rules that prohibit actors' responses that
    would yield time consuming loops, to adjustments fashioned
    and implemented by specialized workers experienced in
    facilitating convergence when particular situations arise.
    Devising and choosing from among these and other possibilities
    is a practical issue in implementing any actual participatory economy.
    Assuming the procedures chosen do not violate principles
    essential to participatory planning, considerations include </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The extent to which iteration workers could bias
            outcomes </li>
        <li>The extent of reductions in the number of iterations
            required to reach a plan </li>
        <li>The amount of planning time saved through
            compartmentalizing subsets of iterations, and </li>
        <li>How much less onerous to producers and consumers
            their calculations could be made. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>A Typical Planning Process</h2>
    <p>Since the procedure we have described is dramatically
    different from traditional market and central planning allocation,
    it is useful to summarize by describing what a typical
    planning process might look and feel like to its participants. </p>
    <p>The first step is for each individual to think about her
    or his plan for the year. Individuals know they will end up working
    in a balanced job complex, and can expect to consume an
    average consumption bundle unless their work effort is above
    or below normal or special needs dictate otherwise. The first decision
    is whether they want to &#147;save&#148; by working longer or
    consuming less than average, or &#147;borrow&#148; by working
    less or consuming more than average. Facilitation boards
    provide an initial estimate of what average consumption and
    average work loads will be for the year based on last year's
    levels, last year's investments in equipment and training,
    and adjustments that occurred during last year's iterations.
    When you make your first proposal you are not only proposing
    to do specific work and consume specific items, but you are proposing
    a level of work contribution and consumption request for
    yourself, and, implicitly, at least on average, for everyone
    else as well. To be realistic you must coordinate your work
    and consumption proposals, though you need not agree with
    facilitation board growth estimates. </p>
    <p>In other words, what you propose is: &#147;I would like to
    work so much at my job complex and to consume so much broken
    down in the following way.&#148; And this proposal is based
    on last year's experience, your prediction of economic growth,
    and your individual decision about saving and borrowing.
    Everyone makes such a choice, trying to optimize given their
    particular preferences and within the constraint that the
    overall amount consumed must be produced and that
    responsibilities and rewards in this endeavor will be
    distributed equitably. </p>
    <p>After first proposals are summed, new indicative prices
    are calculated and new projections of social averages estimated.
    Note that it would not even be possible to implement most
    initial production proposals since in most firms one person
    in a team may have proposed working more hours than another person
    in the same team, even though they can only work together.
    Moreover, most goods will be in excess demand so the initial
    plan is infeasible as well. </p>
    <p>Again every individual would formulate a new response. </p>
    <p>You compare your proposed work load and proposed
    consumption to the average proposals of others. You might also
    consider more localized averages, for example in your firm or
    industry, and in your council or neighborhood. You certainly
    consider the status of each item you ordered or proposed since
    excess demands and supplies will be reflected in changes in indicative
    prices. </p>
    <p>That is, you will be faced with summaries of the statuses
    of goods as well as new estimates of social opportunity costs
    and benefits. After you consult descriptive explanations for
    what seems odd to you, like large changes in worker
    productivity or consumer choice, and after you consult with
    whomever you like and whatever data you are interested in,
    you then make any desired changes before entering your second
    proposals. </p>
    <p>And, once again, all these new proposals are summed and
    the new information made available for the third iteration. </p>
    <p>So far there have been no rules or limits on workers' or
    consumers' responses. Now, however, there could be a change.
    Instead of being able to change proposals in any direction by
    any amount, limits might be imposed. For example, consumers
    might be prohibited from increasing their demand for certain
    goods beyond some maximum percentage above projected averages
    for the economy. </p>
    <p>Or producers might be prevented from lowering output
    proposals by more than some percent in this and subsequent
    rounds. </p>
    <p>The point is simply that it is possible to impose rules
    limiting changes to specific ranges to keep the status of goods
    from varying excessively from round to round. Any particular
    implementation of participatory planning settles on socially
    desirable and mechanically efficient rules to guide the behavior
    of producers and consumers in different iterations. </p>
    <p>In the third or fourth iteration, proposals might be
    limited to councils instead of individuals. Consumers meet in their
    local neighborhood councils and workers in their workplace
    councils to settle on council-wide proposals so that work
    proposals are no longer abstract unimplimentable averages but consistent
    work plans that could be enacted if inputs requested were
    made available. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note that nothing about our procedures pushes different
    actors to consume the same amounts of different goods. </p>
    <p>Individual consumers and producers can hold pat on
    proposals that are far from average. On the other hand, workplaces
    do feel pressure to measure up to average &#147;benefit cost
    ratios,&#148; and consumers will be pressured to keep their overall
    requests from exceeding average income. Indeed, at this stage production
    councils that persist, after allowance for acknowledged
    different circumstances, in proposals with benefit cost
    ratios below their industry ' s average, might have to
    petition their industry for permission not to be disbanded.
    And, similarly, although again with sensible allowances, local consumers'
    councils with above average proposals might have to petition higher
    federations explaining special circumstances to warrant their
    requests. </p>
    <p>The fifth iteration in our hypothetical procedure might
    deploy still another rule to accelerate planning. This time facilitation
    boards extrapolate from the previous iterations to provide
    five different final plans that could be reached by the
    iterative process. What distinguishes the five plans is that
    each entails slightly different total product, work expended,
    average consumption, and average investment. </p>
    <p>All actors then vote, as units, for one of these five
    feasible plans. Each plan is a consistent whole and implimentable. </p>
    <p>Once one of the five is chosen as the base operating plan,
    units adjust requests in subsequent iterations in conformity
    with the base plan until individual agreements are also
    reached. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>While we must still address important aspects of
    participatory allocation, it is useful to summarize here
    where our argument stands. We have argued earlier that
    hierarchical production and consumption, markets, and central planning are
    individually and in combination incompatible with efficient,
    egalitarian, economies in which people control their own
    lives and enjoy solidarity. We have also presented a
    description of participatory, nonhierarchical production and
    a description of participatory, equitable consumption. In
    this chapter/lecture we have described a planning procedure that
    promotes participation, equity, solidarity, and diversity and
    supports rather than undermines participatory production and
    consumption within units. </p>
    <p>What remains is to demonstrate that a participatory
    economy can yield desirable outcomes efficiently. To do that we
    examine the convergence and efficiency properties of a
    mathematical model of participatory planning in chapter 5,
    and propose various simulation and other social experiments regarding
    its &#147;practical feasibility&#148; in chapter 6. </p>
    <p>[This latter stuff is done mathematically, in the
    technical book, but here we will settle for cogent argument,
    I think.] </p>
    <p>So, for what it is worth, this is what the same type of
    material as the other lectures is like, when written without mathematics,
    but for professional economists. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h1>Questions about Allocation</h1>
    <p>And here are some questions taking off from the material
    presented above. </p>
    <p>&#147;Participatory workers must be able to weigh the
    gains from working less or employing less productive though more
    fulfilling techniques, against the consequent loss of
    consumer well-being. Participatory consumers need to be able
    to weigh the gains of a consumption request against the sacrifices required
    to produce it. Participatory workers must be able to
    distinguish an equitable work load from one that is too light
    or too heavy. And participatory consumers need to be able to distinguish
    reasonable consumption demands from ones that are unreasonable
    or overly modest. Finally, all actors must know the true
    social costs and benefits of things they demand or supply,
    that is, all the non-human and human, quantifiable and
    non-quantifiable consequences of their choices, if they are
    going to participate in informed collective self-management.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is this acceptable? Does this seem like an accurate
            accounting of what is needed to have a good allocation communications
            system? Do you have different ideas for an economy
            you would like? </li>
        <li>What are prices for, in any economy? What do we do
            with them? When are prices useful and worthwhile? What
            attributes make some prices harmful? Why do we call
            our prices &#147;indicative prices&#148; instead of
            simply prices? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;So, without engaging in undue mystification, we
    should remember that estimates of social costs and benefits
    with any claim to accuracy must arise from social,
    communicative processes. The trick is to organize these processes so
    people have no incentives to dissimulate regarding their true desires,
    and all have equal opportunity to manifest their feelings. It
    is precisely because our participatory planning process is
    different from the flawed communicative processes of market
    and centrally planned allocation that the prices to which it
    gives rise will be different as well.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What the hell does the above paragraph mean? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;The idea is that qualitative information is
    necessary if quantitative indicators are to be kept as accurate
    as possible. But qualitative information is also necessary to
    develop workers' sensitivity to fellow workers' situations
    and everyone's understanding of the intricate tapestry of
    human relations that determines what we can and cannot
    consume or produce. So both to assure accuracy and to foster solidarity
    we need a continual, social resetting of prices in light of
    updated qualitative information about work lives and consumption
    activity. Thus, the cybernetic burden of a participatory
    allocation procedure is considerably greater than for
    non-participatory economies. Not only must a participatory economy
    generate and revise accurate quantitative measures of social costs
    and benefits in light of changing conditions, but it must
    communicate substantial qualitative information about others' conditions as
    well.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is different about this view, and the one
            typical of our own society? Is the above view okay
            with you? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;In short, participatory planning can obtain a
    reasonable first estimate of effort expended by counting labor
    hours because people's job complexes have been balanced.
    These estimates can then be revised in light of effort intensity ratings
    by one's work mates. In attempting to gain consumption
    flexibility, only unbalancing job complexes is
    prohibited.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>And what does that mean, in practice? And is it
            acceptable to you? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;To guard against `reductionist accounting' each
    actor needs access to a list of everything that goes into
    producing goods directly and indirectly, and a description of
    what will be gained from consuming them.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why? And under what conditions do we need this? How
            often? What does this information look like and how
            is it to be communicated? What is going on here,
            methodologically, in trying to figure out a vision? </li>
        <li>What is a council? Of what use are they? What kind do
            I propose we have in a good economy? Do you agree or
            not, and why? How diverse can they be in their
            structure? What constraints operate on them? Are councils part
            and parcel of real participation and democracy, or an obstacle
            to it? </li>
        <li>What is a facilitation board? What do they do? Why?
            Are these functions necessary? Is there a better way
            to get them done? What requirements do we need to
            place on institutions that facilitate planning? Who
            would work in them? With what perks and problems? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;Each consumption actor proposes a consumption
    plan.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine. Who are the &#147;actors&#148; and what
            constitutes such a proposed plan? IS there a better
            way to go? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;Similarly, each production actor proposes a
    production plan.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Again, who are the actors, and what constitutes such
            a proposed plan? Does it make sense? </li>
        <li>How do the consumers' first proposals likely compare
            with the producers' first proposals? Why? What would
            we think if what was proposed as output was greater
            than what people said they wanted for input? What is
            to be done about discrepancies? Does participatory planning
            seem like a sensible approach? Would it be better to
            circumvent the hassle via a central planning approach,
            or a market approach? </li>
        <li>What does it mean to say that to start planning for
            this year, workers and consumers councils &#147;access relevant
            data from last year&quot;? Why? How does this help?
            What pitfalls are involved with taking this approach? </li>
        <li>Why do they next &#147;receive information from
            facilitation boards estimating this year's probable changes
            in prices and income in light of existing knowledge
            of past investment decisions and changes in the labor force&#148;?
            Are there problems with this? </li>
        <li>And why do &#147;they receive information from higher
            level production and consumption councils regarding long-term
            investment projects or collective consumption
            proposals already agreed to in previous plans that imply
            commitments for this year&#148;? Also, does this mean
            there is some center making decisions for everybody
            else? </li>
        <li>What are they learning when &#147;by reviewing
            changes in their own proposals made during last year's
            planning they assess how much they had to scale down
            their consumption desires or their plans to improve
            the quality of work life, and look to see what
            increases in average income and improvements in the
            quality of average work complexes are projected this
            year over last&#148;? </li>
        <li>How do the actors develop proposals for the coming
            year? What do they take into account? What calculations
            and judgments do they engage in? </li>
        <li>What degree of detail does a proposal embody? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;In the same way, a firm's iteration board provides
    all its workers with summaries of last year's production schedule,
    including what was initially proposed, changes made during
    planning iterations, and what was (finally) approved, as well
    as a prediction of this year's requests based on extrapolations
    from new demographic data and the trajectory of last year's iterations.
    Individual workers consider this information, discuss ideas
    for improving the quality of work life, and enter proposals
    which are averaged into the firm's first proposal for
    &#147;inputs&#148; and &#147;outputs.&#148; After some number
    of iterations, firm proposals are discussed, negotiated, and
    decided as a unit rather than each individual making his or
    her own proposal and these being averaged. Besides
    quantitative proposals for each production and consumption
    unit, a qualitative addenda including descriptions of changes
    in circumstances and conditions is also entered into the
    computerized planning system. At any point any council can
    access the data banks of any facilitation board and any other
    council.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Either defend or critique this from the point of view
            of some set of values you believe in. Does it
            facilitate the values I have been touting? </li>
        <li>With the first proposals in, how do we know whether
            they constitute a plan or not? </li>
        <li>What is the next step for each actor--consumers,
            producers, and facilitation boards? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;The need to win approval from other similar councils
    forces councils whose per capita consumption request is significantly
    above the social average to reduce their overall requests.
    But the need to reduce can be alleviated by substituting
    goods whose indicative prices have fallen for those whose prices have
    risen. Attention focuses on the degree to which units diverge
    from current and projected averages, and on whether their
    reasons for doing so are compelling.&#148; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Is this good? Why or why not? </li>
        <li>&#147;Similarly workers' councils whose ratios of
            social benefits of outputs to social costs of inputs were
            lower than average would come under pressure to
            increase either efficiency or effort, or to explain
            why the quantitative indicators are misleading in
            their particular case. Before increasing their work
            commitment, workers would try to substitute inputs whose
            indicative prices had fallen for inputs whose
            indicative prices had risen, and substitute outputs
            whose indicative prices had risen for outputs whose
            indicative prices had fallen.&#148; </li>
        <li>What does this mean? Does it seem positive or
            negative to you? </li>
        <li>What is a planning iteration, and explain why parecon
            does or doesn't converge (a) to a plan, (b) to outcomes
            that are desirable? Suppose in practice it seems to
            converge too slowly. What would be your reaction? </li>
        <li>To what extent is society bound by the plan it
            initially establishes? To what extent can final outcomes diverge
            from those planned, for individuals, collectives,
            etc. How does this happen? </li>
        <li>What is the role of slack planning? What kinds of
            things do we know in advance that enable us to be prepared
            for deviations between what people say they want, and
            what, in fact, they likely will want? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&#147;A little thought reveals that convergence can be a
    complicated matter. Adjusting indicative prices to reduce excess
    supplies and demands is more complicated in practice than in
    economists' theoretical models with all their convenient
    assumptions. For example, a product in excess demand in one iteration
    could overshoot equilibrium and be in excess supply in the
    next iteration as workers offer to produce more and consumers
    offer to request less in response to a price increase. Worse
    still, considering that each product's status affects the
    status of many others, progress in one industry could disrupt equilibrium
    in another. Theoreticians' solutions to these headaches always assume
    away the troublesome phenomena. Whether the issue is market equilibrium
    and stability or convergence of iterative planning
    procedures, it is well known that convexity and gross
    substitutability assumptions are good aspirin for these
    theoretical headaches. But simplifying assumptions are no aspirin
    at all for practitioners operating in the real world.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>So what is to be done about this? </li>
        <li>Please summarize in your own words what a typical
            planning process might look and feel like to its participants.
            And please comment on whether you think this is a
            good use of the individual's energies or not, a good
            way to allocate or not? And, if you think not, please
            note if you have any ideas for improvements, or for
            an alternative approach. </li>
        <li>What is the relation between balanced job complexes
            and particpatory planning and remuneration according to
            effort and sacrifice? Are these independent options,
            or do they relate to one another in some deeper way? </li>
        <li>What do you like about parecon? What worries you
            about it? </li>
    </ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this chapter, as usual, I will start by providing some
    answers to previous questions, and then move on. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to (Some of) Lecture 8's Questions</h2>
    <p>I said, last lecture: &#147;Participatory workers must be
    able to weigh the gains from working less or employing less productive
    though more fulfilling techniques, against the consequent
    loss of consumer well- being. Participatory consumers need to
    be able to weigh the gains of a consumption request against the
    sacrifices required to produce it. Participatory workers must
    be able to distinguish an equitable work load from one that
    is too light or too heavy. And participatory consumers need
    to be able to distinguish reasonable consumption demands from
    ones that are unreasonable or overly modest. Finally, all
    actors must know the true social costs and benefits of things they
    demand or supply, that is, all the nonhuman and human,
    quantifiable and non-quantifiable consequences of their choices,
    if they are going to participate in informed collective
    self-management.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is this acceptable? Does this seem like an accurate
            accounting of what is needed to have a good allocation communications
            system? Do you have different ideas for an economy
            you would like? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, it seems to me like an accurate accounting. I have
    few ideas beyond what is in the books... In fact, when I think
    about it I realize that since writing them, while I have
    spent much time answering questions or reacting to confusions and
    criticisms, I have had almost no time to spend thinking about enriching
    the vision, or refining it, or augmenting it. Strange. But
    then why shouldn't others do that, in any event? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are prices for, in any economy? What do we do
            with them? When are prices useful and worthwhile? What
            attributes make some prices harmful? Why do we call
            our prices &#147;indicative prices&#148; instead of
            simply prices? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prices are to provide information to help actors make
    choices as part of the allocation process, it seems to me. We
    register them, and then make our choices in light of
    implications, in part clarified by knowing prices. </p>
    <p>Prices are useful and worthwhile when they help us make
    decisions that truly reflect our desires and capacities and
    accurately account for those of others, and broader
    implications. Prices are better or worse, therefore, to the degree that
    they convey an accurate (if very summary) representation of
    the relative costs and benefits of options. They are less
    useful, the more they misrepresent these, They are harmful
    when they systematically and inexorably misrepresent, particularly
    if always in the same direction, as with the way market
    prices misrepresent externalities, social goods, etc. etc. </p>
    <p>We call our prices indicative to emphasize that they are
    information which we utilize alongside other information, and
    that they are products of a social process designed to
    provide useful information and not a power struggle designed
    to have winners and losers. </p>
    <p>I said, last lecture: &#147;So, without engaging in undue
    mystification, we should remember that estimates of social costs
    and benefits with any claim to accuracy must arise from
    social, communicative processes. The trick is to organize
    these processes so people have no incentives to dissimulate regarding
    their true desires, and all have equal opportunity to
    manifest their feelings. It is precisely because our
    participatory planning process is different from the flawed
    communicative processes of market and centrally planned allocation
    that the prices to which it gives rise will be different as well.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What the hell does the above paragraph mean? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Well, I guess it means what it says. I am not sure I can
    answer this one either...If prices emerge from a process that
    is supposed to allow each actor to express their preferences
    and desires and have these accounted for proportionately as
    the actor is affected, then it is key that the process gives actors
    no reason to misrepresent themselves and provides them every
    means to know their own true interests and feelings. We claim
    parecon has these qualities. If it doesn't, then it needs to
    be corrected, or replaced... </p>
    <p>I also said: &#147;The idea is that qualitative
    information is necessary if quantitative indicators are to be kept
    as accurate as possible. But qualitative information is also
    necessary to develop workers' sensitivity to fellow workers'
    situations and everyone's understanding of the intricate
    tapestry of human relations that determines what we can and
    cannot consume or produce. So both to assure accuracy and to
    foster solidarity we need a continual, social resetting of
    prices in light of updated qualitative information about work
    lives and consumption activity. Thus, the cybernetic burden
    of a participatory allocation procedure is considerably
    greater than for non-participatory economies. Not only must a
    participatory economy generate and revise accurate
    quantitative measures of social costs and benefits in light
    of changing conditions, but it must communicate substantial qualitative information
    about others' conditions as well.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is different about this view, and the one
            typical of our own society? Is the above view okay
            with you? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our society the qualitative information that is passed
    in the allocation process (in market exchanges) has as its purpose
    getting someone to do something regardless of the merit of
    their doing so. Thus we have ads aimed at getting someone to
    buy something, regardless of their need for it. The goal
    isn't helping someone to do what they wish, in light of true
    knowledge, etc. It is getting someone to buy, regardless of
    whether it will help the person, pleasure them, or whatever.
    Thus ads are generally manipulative, full of lies, and so on. </p>
    <p>Notice: In parecon producers never want people to purchase
    what they produce other than if they are really going to
    benefit from it. There is no incentive to want to increase
    sales, per se... </p>
    <p>(Think about book publishers now. What do they care about?
    Number of books sold, or impact of the books? Well, what does
    the best seller list measure...) </p>
    <p>And I said: &#147;In short, participatory planning can
    obtain a reasonable first estimate of effort expended by
    counting labor hours because people's job complexes have been
    balanced. These estimates can then be revised in light of effort
    intensity ratings by one's work mates. In attempting to gain consumption flexibility,
    only unbalancing job complexes is prohibited.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>And what does that mean, in practice? And is it
            acceptable to you? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think what it means in practice is what I describe in
    theory, with a degree of practical flexibility. And yes, it
    is quite OK with me... </p>
    <p>And I said: &#147;To guard against `reductionist
    accounting' each actor needs access to a list of everything that
    goes into producing goods directly and indirectly, and a
    description of what will be gained from consuming them.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why? And under what conditions do we need this? How
            often? What does this information look like and how
            is it to be communicated? What is going on here,
            methodologically, in trying to figure out a vision? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In fact, I think the sentence is overstated. We need to be
    able to do this, and to do it often enough so we are in touch
    with the reality of production and consumption and how it
    works and its broad effects, and the real meaning of the
    numbers we call indicative prices, and so on. But we don't
    need to do it for every item, and all the time. </p>
    <p>It is really a kind of general learning process, on the
    one hand, developing knowledge of the economy, and a procedure
    for checking things out when one's inclinations and prices or
    requests seem out of whack and one wants to know why, in more
    detail. </p>
    <p>I think the info is qualitative, descriptive, and is
    communicated in words by telecommunications, of course. What is
    going on, methodologically, is we are trying to figure out
    what kinds of structural processes, steps, information, etc., must
    be utilized for allocation to have the properties we want for it. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a council? Of what use are they? What kind do
            I propose we have in a good economy? Do you agree or
            not, and why? How diverse can they be in their
            structure? What constraints operate on them? Are councils part
            and parcel of real participation and democracy, or an obstacle
            to it? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A council is a set of relations among a bunch of people.
    They allow bunches of people to make collective decisions
    that are not simply the sum of each person's individual
    decisions. Thus, for example, decisions about workplace organization,
    say, or collective goods consumption. I propose that we have councils
    that are effective means for arriving at group decisions in
    ways compatible with our overarching values--solidarity,
    equity, self management, diversity. There are many different ways
    to attain this, I suspect, and choosing among them may be largely
    a matter of the size and role of the council, of the preferences
    of its members, of the types of decisions under review, etc. Councils are
    an essential ingredient of real democracy, it seems to me. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a facilitation board? What do they do? Why?
            Are these functions necessary? Is there a better way
            to get them done? What requirements do we need to
            place on institutions that facilitate planning? Who
            would work in them? With what perks and problems? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A facilitation board is a workplace whose product is
    information and data useful for people trying to participate in
    the participatory planning process. Therefore, facilitation
    boards amass data and present it in accessible format. I think
    the critical requirement of these institutions is that they
    function within the norms of the economy, consistent with its
    values, etc. One could imagine additional requirements, but I
    doubt any additional ones are necessary because I do not see
    any compelling way for people working in these institutions
    to aggrandize themselves at the expense of others. People would
    work in them who wanted to. The perks and problems, as with any
    other workplace, would be those associated with the tasks
    involved in the work. The workers would have balanced job complexes,
    of course. </p>
    <p>I said &#147;each consumption actor proposes a consumption
    plan.&#148; I also said &#147;Similarly, each production &#147;actor&#148; proposes
    a production plan.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine. Who are the &#147;actors&#148; and what
            constitutes such a proposed plan? Is there a better
            way to go? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consumers and consumer units and councils, and likewise
    producers and producers' units, councils. I like it... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do the consumers' first proposals likely compare
            with the producers' first proposals? Why? What would
            we think if what was proposed as output was greater
            than what people said they wanted for input? What is
            to be done about discrepancies? Does participatory planning
            seem like a sensible approach? Would it be better to
            circumvent the hassle via a central planning approach,
            or a market approach? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consumers first proposals should seek more than producers
    first proposals offer to produce--because both are supposed
    to ask for their ideal preferred options. I would think that
    people were curbing their requests unduly, and exaggerating
    their desires to work unduly, if we had opposite outcomes. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Discrepancies are reduced by way of the allocation
    planning process. That is its purpose. The problem with the central
    planning approach is that even if we assume a benign planner,
    with omniscient insight into what is needed, we still don't
    have people making decisions in proportion as they are
    affected by them. In practice, of course, a central planner
    with disproportionate powers will be neither benign nor
    all-knowing. The problem with the market solution, however
    competitive, is that it arrives at answers by a process that
    is biased in various ways (for example, against public goods,
    etc.) thus yielding bad outcomes, as well as denying
    proportionate say... </p>
    <p>The additional problem is that in practice both these
    modes of allocation produce class division... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does it mean to say that to start planning for
            this year, workers and consumers councils &#147;access relevant
            data from last year&#148;? Why? How does this help?
            What pitfalls are involved with taking this approach? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It means we have knowledge of last year's plan to use as a
    starting point in thinking about what we wish to do this year.
    We can modify in light of changes in technology, population,
    our own tastes, etc. The problem is we could have a mistake
    last year affect this year, and then affect next year, etc. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Why do they next &#147;receive information from
            facilitation boards estimating this year's probable changes
            in prices and income in light of existing knowledge
            of past investment decisions and changes in the labor force&#148;?
            Are there problems with this? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We know our budget from last year. We get info that lets
    us figure out what it would be with the same level of work
    this year... Then we can make intelligent decisions about
    whether we want to work the same level, more, or less. </p>
    <p>And why do &#147;they receive information from higher
    level production and consumption councils regarding long-term
    investment projects or collective consumption proposals
    already agreed to in previous plans that imply commitments
    for this year&#148;? Also, does this mean there is some
    center making decisions for everybody else? </p>
    <p>Part of my income is spent on collective goods. I need to
    know this both because it reduces the amount left to spend on
    individual items, and because the content of the collective
    goods consumption affects what I need/want individually. If I
    have a ball field coming to my neighborhood, or a gym or library,
    it has implications... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are they learning when &#147;by reviewing
            changes in their own proposals made during last year's
            planning they assess how much they had to scale down
            their consumption desires or their plans to improve
            the quality of work life, and look to see what
            increases in average income and improvements in the
            quality of average work complexes are projected this
            year over last&#148;? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>People are learning what is possible, what is desired, and
    how they match up, for others, and for themselves. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do the actors develop proposals for the coming
            year? What do they take into account? What calculations
            and judgments do they engage in? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I figure my desires and tastes against my preference for
    leisure time, against knowledge of changing prices and budgets.
    I create a new proposal for this year by amending/adapting
    and altering last years, I would think. I am calculating what
    my budget is, how much I (everyone) want to work, how much I
    want different possible items, and so on. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What degree of detail does a proposal embody? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a subtle question. Statistics are powerful things.
    Suppose we know the demand for shirts. Can we then calculate
    how many of each size and style, based on past knowledge?
    Suppose we know the demand for nuts, grossly. Can we then
    calculate details? And so on. Much of the detail of daily consumption
    does not need to be arrived at in the global plan. The more
    so as an economy is intentionally structured to reduce the
    need for details... </p>
    <ul>
        <li>With the first proposals in, how do we know whether
            they constitute a plan or not? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Does amount desired match amount proposed to be produced,
    for every good, within an acceptable fudge factor level? </p>
    <p>I said &#147;The need to win approval from other similar
    councils forces councils whose per capita consumption request
    is significantly above the social average to reduce their
    overall requests. But the need to reduce can be alleviated by
    substituting goods whose indicative prices have fallen for
    those whose prices have risen. Attention focuses on the
    degree to which units diverge from current and projected
    averages, and on whether their reasons for doing so are
    compelling.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is this good? Why or why not? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, I think it is precisely what's needed. It is a kind
    of dynamic process, a pressure, that causes all the actors in the
    system to move their proposals toward a stable plan. And yet,
    each is continually guided by ever more accurate information,
    and his or her own preferences. </p>
    <p>And I said: &#147;Similarly workers' councils whose ratios
    of social benefits of outputs to social costs of inputs were lower
    than average would come under pressure to increase either
    efficiency or effort, or to explain why the quantitative
    indicators are misleading in their particular case. Before increasing their
    work commitment, workers would try to substitute inputs whose
    indicative prices had fallen for inputs whose indicative
    prices had risen, and substitute outputs whose indicative
    prices had risen for outputs whose indicative prices had
    fallen.&#148; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What does this mean? Does it seem positive or
            negative to you? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is just an elaborate way to talk about trying to get
    some job done at the least cost. Yes, it seems positive to
    me, given that the quantitative indicators employed account
    for all social affects. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a planning iteration, and explain why parecon
            does or doesn't converge (a) to a plan, (b) to outcomes
            that are desirable? Suppose in practice it seems to
            converge too slowly. What would be your reaction? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An iteration is just a round of &#147;bargaining&#148; or
    negotiating in the planning process. The system converges
    because at each step all actors have information and
    constraints/incentives to move toward convergence. If it is
    too slow, we would need to find ways to speed the process,
    without subverting its virtues. But for me &#147;too
    slow&#148; is relative and I would think a reasonable amount
    of time given to planning economic life would be quite
    acceptable, especially given the reduction in time needed for many
    many tasks thereby eliminated from economic life. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Evaluating Parecon</h2>
    <p>I think this is really not for me to do. And my intention
    when outlining the course was that the class would do this, based
    on methods and lessons learned, and their own inclinations.
    Let me simply provide some minimal guidance. </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><i>Evaluating any economy means describing one's
        criteria of value, and then determining to what extent
        the economy fulfills these. For example, suppose one is most
        concerned about ecological sanity, or equity between
        races, or&#151;well&#151;whatever. Then one assesses the
        economy asking how its dynamics fulfill or deny the
        values in question. </i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Also, one might compare the economy to others, on the same
    axes of valuation. </p>
    <p>If you want to undertake this &#147;assignment&#148; for
    parecon, for example, I think it entails deciding what you
    value, what you want an economy to accomplish, and then
    assessing whether parecon measures up, in general, and compared
    to other economic models, by examining its core institutions
    for production, consumption, and allocation and determining
    their implications vis--vis the values you favor. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Economic Vision in Society</h2>
    <p>If you think about what we did for the economy, this topic
    is actually conceptually just an extension. We thought about
    some basic defining features&#151;production, consumption,
    allocation. We established goals for each but also knew that
    whatever choice we made for any one feature had to be compatible with
    choices for other features. </p>
    <p>Thus, the needs of production and what it provides, have
    to fit the needs of consumption and what it provides, have to
    fit the needs of allocation and what it provides. And this
    has to be true not just for the flow of material goods, say, or
    even labor, but also for types of consciousness, skills,
    values, and so on. You can't have workplace democracy and
    councils and balanced job complexes in each production unit
    if the production units exist in context of a market or
    central planning allocation system that creates class
    division. You can't have participatory planning with
    equitable remuneration if you have workplaces that are
    organized hierarchically, thereby creating class interests. To
    return to an earlier analogy, this is like trying to put
    together a stereo from components and picking speakers and an
    amplifier which are mismatched in that the speakers require
    more power than the amp can deliver, or the amp delivers too
    much power for the speakers to handle. </p>
    <p>The same holds for the defining features of a society. We
    can decide on aims for an economy, but we must also recognize
    that our economy has to intertwine with a kinship sphere,
    cultural sphere, political sphere. And each of these has to
    be at least compatible with the rest. It can't be that one critical
    side of life requires attributes squelched by others, or that
    one produces attributes contrary to others. </p>
    <p>Knowing one sphere, we can't deduce the rest. But we can
    come to some conclusions about attributes other spheres must
    have to be compatible. So, knowing that we want a parecon, we
    can deduce some qualities that other spheres will have to
    have to be compatible with the economy. And the same holds the
    other way, too, if we develop a vision for other spheres of
    social life. </p>
    <p>So here are my questions, as a way to guide, provoke
    conceptualizing on this axis. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are some goals you would like to see attained by
            a revolutionized kinship sphere. What implications would
            this have for an economy, and is parecon compatible? </li>
        <li>What are some goals you would like to see attained by
            a revolutionized cultural sphere. What implications would
            this have for an economy, and is parecon compatible? </li>
        <li>What are some goals you would like to see attained by
            a revolutionized political sphere. What implications would
            this have for an economy, and is parecon compatible? </li>
        <li>Finally, what implications do you think having a
            parecon has for accompanying kinship, cultural, or
            political spheres? </li>
    </ul>

<h2>ShareWorld University and High Schools On Line</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting uses of telecommunications is for education. Though university level courses generally cost upwards 
of $1500, on ShareWorld full ten week courses, with lectures, readings, faculty participation in weekly discussions, etc., average 
only $50 a semester. There are diverse faculty from the sponsoring organizations, from universities, with practical experience, 
etc. Really, a remarkable selection of people. </p>
<p>Here is the window from which one gets information about the online schools. Taking courses is done in closed forums.</p>

<h2>ShareWorld Activism</h2>
<p>There are two primary facilities for promoting online activism on ShareWorld Systems. First, there are 
offerings which allow folks to share information, develop agendas, etc. These include the forums, mailing 
lists, the calendar, etc., tools for altering and updating these, for joining active groups, etc.</p>
<p>There is also, however, a tool specifically geared to using email and fax capabilities to make positions 
widely known and pressure officials. First you choose an area of concern, as in this listing from

<blockquote>
<h2 align=center>From Security To Insecurity State </h2>
<p><em><strong>By Edward S. Herman </strong></em></p>
<p>During the Cold War the United States built an immense national security apparatus, supposedly to counter the 
military threat posed by the Soviet Union, but in fact serving larger goals. Curiously, while the public was 
made anxious about possible war and nuclear incineration, this was a time of relative economic security for the 
population at large. In the post-Cold War years, by contrast, with the military threat no longer credible, 
economic insecurity has increased markedly and we have moved from a security state to an insecurity state. </p>
<p>The security state era was characterized by the development of a tacit social contract between labor and 
capital, the maintenance of high levels of employment under a system of military Keynesianism, and some 
sharing of the gains of technological progress. An important element underlying the relatively peaceful class 
relations was the Cold War and competition with socialist ideas and systems claiming to be socialist. As with 
a non-union company in an economy with significant unionization, where the company management feels 
compelled to treat its workers well to keep unions out, so the leaders of U.S. capitalism felt the need to do the 
same in order to reduce the attractiveness of an alternative model. </p>
<p>With the collapse of the major socialist states and widespread setbacks to social democracy, the material and 
ideological threat of socialism receded. There was no longer a need to compete for the loyalty of workers; the 
vision of an alternative route in which communal interests, equality, and attention to the needs of all citizens 
was the focus, had been at least temporarily removed. Add to this the force and power of a rapidly globalizing 
market system, its political strength and increased ability to constrain social democratic policies, and the 
associated weakening of the labor movement, and the stage was set for the unilateral abrogation of the social 
contract and renewal of open class warfare. Larger and larger circles of workers became subject to 
&#147;reengineering&#148; of the workplace, essentially without defenses; vast numbers were fired, and still larger 
numbers saw their wages and benefits stagnate or decline. Meanwhile, the reengineering elite, owners of 
capital, and banking-security fraternity prospered, and income inequality and polarization increased steadily. 
Welcome to the insecurity state. </p>
<p><strong>Ideological Reengineering </strong></p>
<p>The security state was based on an ideology that focused on the military threat of socialism, as well as the 
inherent economic and political superiority of capitalism. Anticommunism was the centerpiece of security state 
ideology. But socialism had to be seen as inherently aggressive and expansionist; otherwise, how justify arming 
to the teeth, surrounding socialist states with military bases, organizing &#147;contra&#148; armies to attack them (the 
Soviet Union, China, Angola, Cuba, Nicaragua, and others), and engaging in unremitting efforts to destabilize 
each and every one of them? Reams of political and academic propaganda were therefore devoted to proving 
the expansionist tendencies of socialism and the imperative need to &#147;contain&#148; them. (Liberal academic John 
Gaddis explained that the Soviet Union was &#147;perceived&#148; by the West as constituting a &#147;challenge,&#148; which he 
seemed to regard as an adequate justification for the multi-leveled attacks that began with active support of the 
counter-revolutionary White Russian armies and even Western invasion forces.) </p>
<p>Even tiny Nicaragua, under external attack by the U.S. and its proxy forces, was alleged by U.S. officials to be 
pursuing a &#147;revolution without frontiers&#148; (based on a deliberate misreading of a speech by Sandinista minister 
Tomas Borges), and Nicaragua (like Guatemala in 1954) was falsely alleged to be a Moscow proxy and thus 
evidence of Soviet expansionism in action. (This baloney was even disseminated by purported &#147;leftists&#148; like 
Fred Halliday, who, like the Pope in Managua this past February, claimed that the U.S. aggression against 
Nicaragua was really a battle between East and West. Halliday writing in 1989, about Nicaragua among other 
struggles, said &#147;the course of these disputes is to a great extent still formed by East-West rivalry.&#148; The Pope 
said that Nicaragua had been &#147;a shooting gallery of the superpowers,&#148; a lie as only one superpower was 
shooting). These incessant attacks forced the poor and struggling socialist countries to waste resources on arms 
and reinforced their worst political tendencies; but if the West's policies were merely &#147;containing aggression,&#148; 
any systematic effects on socialist development could be (and were) blamed on socialism, not Western 
aggression. </p>
<p>Western ideology and anticommunism also rested on the alleged naturalness and inevitability of the market 
system -- based in turn on humanity's &#147;propensity to truck, barter, and exchange&#148; in Adam Smith's famous 
phrase. Communal systems and especially state-sponsored and state-run activities were unnatural, and when 
heavily used put societies on the &#147;road to serfdom.&#148; (The counter-argument, effectively made by Karl Polanyi 
in <em>The Great Transformation</em>, is that the unnaturalness and destructive consequences of an unconstrained 
market are precisely what has caused welfare states to emerge in country after country, to contain and repair 
free market damage.) </p>
<p>With the collapse of socialism, the ideologists have shifted the emphasis from socialist aggression and gulags 
to the &#147;miracle of the market&#148; (Reagan), although there are periodic dredgings from Soviet archives as 
reminders of socialist crimes and Western leftist naivet&lt;@233&gt;. The ideologues have two advantages in 
scoring these cheap points: only Soviet secret police records are open, not those of the U.S.; and the ideologues 
(Will, Kraut-hammer, Limbaugh, etc.) can pontificate without having to contend with rebuttals. Readers of <em>Z 
Magazine </em>will be interested to know that in one of the rare cases where an establishment ideologue, in this 
case Richard Perle, was induced to participate in an open debate with Noam Chomsky, at Ohio State 
University in 1988, the tape of this encounter reveals that Perle was confuted on virtually every point and left 
speechless. </p>
<p>New World Order ideology rests on an obfuscation of ends and means. That is, while the ultimate objective of 
the economic order is said to be maximizing human happiness and satisfaction -- implicitly for all members of 
society -- this end has become subordinated to the preferred means of achieving it: namely, private markets 
operating virtually without government interference. But these preferred means happen to serve well a tiny 
global elite, so that the devotion to private markets as means is actually a cover for a real but hidden goal. The 
&#147;problem&#148; for the Swiss Guards of politics, media, and academia is how to rationalize and sell policies that 
serve a narrow class interest and fail systematically to accomplish their purported end. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the purr word &#147;freedom&#148; has come to connote, first, and sometimes exclusively, the freedom of 
business to do its thing, or as Steve Forbes expressed it, &#147;the right to spend your money anywhere in the world 
on whatever you wanted.&#148; This is why the editors of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and numerous economists have 
considered fascists and authoritarians like Pinochet and Salinas great statesmen. Of course the apologists argue 
that even if free markets are not producing political freedom now, they will surely do so at some future date; 
but what patience they display at the sometimes very lengthy and murderous cleansing operations of their 
totalitarian-free enterprise friends. How inconsistently they argued that the beauty of NAFTA was that it 
&#147;locked Mexico in&#148; to a free market path that the Mexican people might reject if they had a democratic choice. </p>
<p>But up to this point such issues have been muted. Only a Republican right-wing extremist like Buchanan can 
raise the economic/class issue in a twisted form, be heard, briefly, before he is hustled off the scene, and impel 
the mainstream media to put up multi-part personal interest accounts of the suffering of ordinary citizens. But 
for the dominant institutions and mainstream intellectuals, the answer remains: there is no other option but 
&#147;freedom,&#148; so let us privatize further, shrink the government and get the budget in balance, remove the burden 
of dependency from the backs of the poor, and make life more comfortable for the business community so that it 
will have an incentive to create jobs. </p>
<p><em>Serving the Insecurity State</em> </p>
<p>The economists have played their usual supporting role in backing up the preferences and demands of the 
powerful. It should be noted, of course, that there are quite a few economists who dissent from the mainstream 
consensus, but their voices are only rarely heard in the propaganda system. Their marginalization is aided by 
the fact that the &#147;conservative labyrinth&#148; (John Saloma, <em>Ominous Politics: The New Conservative Labyrinth</em>, 
Hill and Wang, 1984) -- with Olin, the Hoover Institution, and the American Enterprise Institute at the center of 
a network of corporate funded thinktanks -- funds a large number of proper thinking economists, helps get them 
accredited, their books and Op Ed columns published, and their opinions heard in the mainstream media. The 
dominant pundits are part of this network and push its preferred ideas, and the mainstream media accepts the 
labyrinth's &#147;experts&#148; while filtering out dissenting experts and messages. The Economic Policy Institute, which 
produces well researched but left-of-center analyses, is cited much less often by the press than the American 
Enterprise Institute, and is regularly referred to in the <em>New York Times</em> as &#147;labor supported.&#148; The paper's 
reporters never mention that AEI is corporate supported. </p>
<p>The mainstream economists have joined the Swiss Guards for a number of reasons: they are members of the 
elite, so that their alignment with the dominant class -- and against the working class majority -- on issues like 
NAFTA is comprehensible partly on that elemental ground. Class interest may also help explain the mainstream 
complaisance in the face of the sharp increase in inequality and immiseration of very large numbers of people. 
The leading economists are prospering, and, as noted, the conservative labyrinth pays well for cultivating 
sound thoughts, so that on Chicago School Gary Becker's logic -- that everything can be explained by the 
economic motive -- joining the Swiss Guards is a sound investment of personal capital on the part of 
economists. Large numbers also serve as paid consultants to private businesses, helping them invest and deal 
with regulators. These economists are literal employees of the corporate system, as are those working for the 
World Bank and IMF. </p>
<p>The economists also want to be practical, and in the New World Order, with George Soros and the banks ready 
to flee in the face of dreaded &#147;populist&#148; policies, and the dominant political parties unable to serve majority 
interests because of Golden Rule (Ferguson, <em>Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and 
the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems</em>, University of Chicago, 1995), &#147;practical&#148; means doing nothing 
upsetting to the monied interests. The work of liberal Stanford economist Paul Krugman illustrates the 
paralyzing effect of subordination to the practical. In his <em>The Age of Diminished Expectations</em> he states that the 
huge increase in inequality in the Reagan years is the &#147;central fact&#148; and problem of the era, but he makes no 
recommendation to rectify the problem -- the trend toward greater inequality &#147;appears politically out of 
bounds;&#148; the problem of poverty &#147;has basically exhausted the patience of the general public.&#148; In fact, polls 
have consistently shown that a majority of the public would like to do something about income distribution; but 
the golden rulers, whose gains rest heavily on the losses of the population, don't -- and this feeds into the 
media, the political system, and by the route of an alleged political unfeasibility, to this practical economist. </p>
<p>The &#147;natural rate of unemployment&#148; is also a tool of the &#147;practical&#148; economist and servant of the status quo. 
Here again, Krugman takes a position that precludes the economy serving ordinary citizens. In his article &#147;Stay 
on Their Backs,&#148; in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> of February 4, 1996, he poses as a liberal opponent of the 
supply-siders who think growth can be stimulated by cheap money. He rebuts these right-wing populists by 
bringing to bear the &#147;natural rate of unemployment,&#148; which at 5.5-6 percent is alleged to be at its limit, so that 
easy money would create inflation, etc. He even cites another liberal economist, Alan Blinder, as supporting 
this conservative position. The most interesting thing about his piece, however, is that Krugman once again 
surrenders to institutional necessity -- having proven to his own satisfaction that expansionary macro-policy is 
unworkable, he says nothing about how the mass distress endemic to the insecurity state is to be alleviated. By 
inference, this is the best of all possible (i.e., practical) worlds; which is to say, liberal economics is 
completely bankrupt. (Liberal textbooks in economics today regularly give great weight and status to the 
&#147;natural rate,&#148; rarely discuss institutional changes that would permit a low rate of unemployment while 
controlling inflation, and they never dismiss it as a mystical and unverifiable instrument of conservative 
policy.) </p>
<p><strong>The Devolution of Economics </strong></p>
<p>Economics has devolved badly over recent decades. Although the threat of macro-instability on a global scale 
has increased with the globalization of money markets, the enormous scale of speculation and new and 
complicated financial instruments, and the absence of a global central bank, there has been great complaisance 
in mainstream economics, and in Chicago School circles a regression of macro-theory to a belief that Say's 
Law (&#147;supply creates its own demand&#148;) and rational market forces make for inherent stabilizing properties in a 
free market system. Worry about monopoly and market power has diminished, and economists opposing 
concentration and centralization trends have not been audible. On income distribution, liberal economist James 
Tobin explained back in 1966 that &#147;the fire has gone out of this one,&#148; and Krugman agrees in 1992 on grounds 
of practicality. The powerful conservative economists couldn't care less, and some like Harvard's (and Hoover 
Institution's) Robert Barro even put a positive gloss on increasing inequality (&#147;Inequality and Its Charms,&#148; Wall 
Street Journal, Feb. 10, 1993). </p>
<p>The fire has also gone out of economists' concern with negative externalities and public goods, both of which 
are increasingly important in a world of advanced chemistry, technology, pressure on natural resources and 
ecology, and interdependence. The triumphant market does not want these market failures and bases for public 
ownership and regulation to be discussed, so the mainstream media and economists have put this set of issues 
on the back burner as well. </p>

<h1 align=center>Forbes: Capitalist Tool </h1>
<h2 align=center><em><strong>By Bob Harris </strong></em></h2>
<p>This article is written right around Groundhog day, when there are still enough Republicans running for 
President to mount a production of Twelve Angry Men. </p>
<p>They all have two things in common: number one, none of the them look like they've had sex since Beowulf was 
written, and number two, they're all scrambling to raise enough money to buy enough TV ads to convince us to 
forget about number one. </p>
<p>You want to know how much money means to the process? Look who's out of the race already. </p>
<p>Arlen Specter is out, because he has no money. Pete Wilson is out, because he has no money. See a pattern 
here? </p>
<p>Dan Quayle and Colin Powell are also out, claiming their families are more important than their careers. For 
the first time in their lives. In case you never studied Iran-Contra, they're both accomplished liars. Truth is, 
neither one was able to raise enough money to begin a campaign. </p>
<p>Bob Dole has the most corporate PAC money. Guess what? He's the front-runner by a mile. See a pattern here? </p>
<p>Here's the deal: in every election for decades, the candidate in each party with the most money has won the 
nomination. It's that simple. The whole primary thing has become little more than a complex form of nationwide 
focus group testing, in which various issues and slogans are test-marketed by each party for use in the general 
election campaign in the fall. </p>
<p>Pat Buchanan will still be around, if only in that 30 percent pain-in-the-ass frighten-the-moderates fashion that 
makes him the Jesse Jackson of the GOP. But he doesn't have much money, so he'll probably snuff it just before 
the convention and settle for another Leni Reifenstahl keynote speech from hell in which he promises a 
balanced budget, school prayer, and living space in the east. </p>
<p>Bob Dornan will be gone, because Americans don't like to vote for someone who looks like he might bite them. 
And he has no money. </p>
<p>Alan Keyes will still be in the race, because he is not sane. Have you heard this guy talk? Rarely in public life 
do we find a man in such need of stronger medication. But Keyes has no money, so he has no chance. </p>
<p>Dick Lugar will be gone. He has no money. Also his name is too cool for words. </p>
<p>Who's doing the GOP names, anyway? </p>
<p>There's an anti-drug fanatic named Gramm. A guy who wants to trim welfare named Bob Dole. Another whose 
whole career is eternally haunted by his cover-up of a political murder -- Specter. Two &#147;family values&#148; types 
who want to increase the military and kill gun control named Dick Armey and Dick Lugar. There's even a sex 
maniac named Packwood. </p>
<p>So I guess the next Republican president will be some guy named Fuckthepoor. </p>
<p>Or maybe he'll just call himself Steve Forbes. </p>
<p>Americans everywhere are asking: What kind of guy is Steve Forbes? </p>
<p>Well, you already know that he inherited every dollar he ever saw, that he never worked a day of real labor in 
his life, and that he has no firm political views whatsoever beyond a desire to exclude himself from any 
obligation to the public good. </p>
<p>You already know that the Forbes family business is an eponymous investment magazine. And you already 
know that running that magazine is the only job Stevie Boy ever had. So hey, let's look at his magazine -- I've 
got the January 22 issue right here -- and see what we find out. </p>
<p>The cover is a strikingly goofy studio photo of some rich old white guy named Charlie Munger, who it turns out 
knows how to pick stocks and is therefore rich enough to buy up the ocean and charge rent to the fish. Charlie's 
supposed to be standing on a beach -- a lot of wannabe rich folks dream about living free and easy on the 
beach, even as they call people who actually do that &#147;bums&#148; and wouldn't dream of going near them -- but he's 
actually posing on a lump of brown dirt in front of a big picture of a beach. It's really goofy and sort of phony 
looking. </p>
<p>OK, that's a superficial observation, I know. But Steve Forbes is pretty goofy and sort of phony looking 
himself, so we're one-for-one. </p>
<p>The magazine is about 50 percent ad space -- that's pretty normal -- with ads for Fidelity Investments, Godiva 
Chocolates, BMW, and Rolex. Pretty rich stuff. </p>
<p>Well, Steve Forbes is pretty rich. We knew that, but still we're two-for-two. </p>
<p>Tell you what. Let's actually read some of this stuff and see what Little Stevie is really all about. </p>
<p>Page 44: an approving article about how Wal-Mart is driving neighborhood supermarkets out of business. 
That's nice. </p>
<p>Page 66: an article denouncing the American Bar Association as &#147;leftist&#148; and calling for the abolition of the 
Legal Services Corporation, which provides legal help to the poor. </p>
<p>Page 98: a commentary equating the evidence of carcinogenic effects from dioxin, PCBs, power lines, and 
microwave ovens to those of women's underwear. </p>
<p>I swear I didn't make that up. </p>
<p>What else? Let's look at some of the main articles, the big features of this month's issue: &#147;Vagit Alekperov is 
the John D. Rockefeller of modern Russia. With guile, arm-twisting, and barely disguised bribery, he's creating 
a world-class oil company.&#148; </p>
<p>Two things: (1) it's nice to see such an open admission that Rockefeller was a thug, and (2) the scary part is 
that Forbes is openly advocating thuggery. </p>
<p>Here's a two-page ad from the Republic of Indonesia, showing a couple of smiling locals in pricey suits cutting 
a deal on a cell phone. The caption reads: &#147;Think Big... Indonesia...a strong pro-business government and 
culture... Today's Big Opportunity.&#148; </p>
<p>This is the same Indonesia which is cutting down its forests, letting American mining companies cyanide-leach 
entire ecosystems to death, and raping the people of Timor. </p>
<p>&#147;Pro-business.&#148; Hmm. That's one way to put it. </p>
<p>&#147;Will Burma become an Asian tiger?&#148; On page 52 there's a long story about how Burma's such a nifty place to 
invest your money. </p>
<p>This is the same Burma (Myanmar, actually, and it has been for the better part of a decade) which is a closed 
police state and an international human rights pariah. This is the Burma where much of the population and their 
traditional lands are being decimated to make room for a U.S. Oil pipeline, and where dissent is often met with 
immediate violent death. </p>
<p>And Forbes is encouraging investment there. </p>
<p>Gee, it sounds like Steve Forbes is the kind of guy who wouldn't give a shit about anything besides rich folks 
making even more money, no matter how many people get screwed, live in misery, or die as a result. </p>
<p>Is that right? Are we three-for-three? </p>
<p>Let's look at his stand on the issue, singular: the Flat Tax. It's simple. Under Forbes's system, inheritances -- 
like how he got every dime of his money -- will not be taxed. At all. Zip. </p>
<p>Under Forbes's system, capital gains and dividends -- Forbes's income from owning stuff -- will not be taxed. 
At all. Zip, zero, nada. </p>
<p>Under Forbes's system, a rich boy who makes a million a year on his stocks and bonds owes nothing, but his 
workers all pay a full taxload, with no deductions. </p>
<p>That's the plan. The rich get richer. Everyone else suffers. See a pattern here? </p>
<p>We're three-for-three. </p>
<p>To review: Once upon a time, Malcolm Forbes built a publishing fortune by pimping propaganda for pirates, 
polluters, and third-world dictators. Now Little Stevie has the loot and he doesn't want to share. He even wants 
to change all the rules so that everybody else has to share but him, and he's willing to buy the White House to 
do it. </p>
<p>And Steve Forbes is calling himself a populist outsider, a champion of the working man. </p>
<p>Oh. One last prediction. By the time you read this, a few newspaper writers and TV reporters will have figured 
out Little Stevie's hustle. Some of them will point out that his greed is the only issue he's remotely concerned 
about. Some will even gently tell the public that this is a bad thing. And that will be about the extent of the 
outrage. </p>
<p>Steve Forbes and what he represents aren't anything unusual; they're standard operating procedure. Steve 
Forbes can get away with trying to buy the government because he's who the government is for. Clinton and 
Dole are really just hired help. Steve Forbes is the real deal. </p>
<p>Are you tired of political system controlled by the rich? </p>
<p>Vote for Forbes. Eliminate the middle man. </p>

<h1>Course Outline--Consumerism in the U.S. Course</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>Faculty: Juliet Schor</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Greetings to all participants in the course on Consumerism in
the United States today. Welcome. I thought I would begin with a
brief description of what this course will be about, and then I
have a few logistical details.</p>

<p>Some personal history: In 1992 I published a book called The
Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure (New York:
Basic Books). The premise of that book was that working hours
have been rising in the United States since the late 1960s, and
that many Americans are now &quot;overworked&quot; and stressed
out. Instead of the leisure society which was predicted as a
result of automation and mechanization, we have become ever more
enslaved to our jobs. The attendant social consequences are
predictable: families without enough time to be together,
children whose parents aren't around enough, growing unemployment
as work hours are concentrated among fewer and fewer employees, a
decline of sleep, a rise in stress, less time for volunteering
and civic participation, excessive business in daily life,
erosion of community, etc. </p>

<p>In order to understand how this has happened, I developed the
idea of the &quot;work and spend&quot; cycle, and argued that our
nation had become enmeshed in this dynamic. In this course, we
will begin with that idea, focussing mainly on the spending side
of it (after an initial section on work and worktimes). Why are
we such a &quot;spendaholic&quot; nation? What dynamics are at
work? What is the role of advertising in our consumerism?
Television and mass media? What is the impact of social
pressure,i.e., keeping up with the Joneses&quot;? Status-seeking?
Are Americans obsessed with novelty? Where is our consumerism
&quot;coming from&quot;?</p>

<p>We will also look at the consequences of consumerist society--
environmental, cultural, economic, human. We will discuss
alternatives to consumerism, such as simple living, and the
voluntary simplicity movement sspringing up around the country.
We will consider the economic and political obstacles to a less
consumerist society. Is it even possible in capitalism? </p>

<p>I am currently at work on a new book on consumerism (still in
the research phase). I will share my new research with you and
will be interested to get your feedback and reactions. </p>

<p>The format and procedures of the course will be this: Every
weekend I will write a lecture, which will be posted by Sunday
evening at 9 pm EST. The first lecture will come this Sunday. I
will also post readings which relate to the lecture, including
two categories of readings: those which are strongly recommended
and very close to the topic, and those which are slightly less
close, but allow you to pursue the issues further or deeper.
These correspond to the usual classroom distinction between
&quot;required&quot; and &quot;recommended&quot; readings. Of
course, in this session, no reading is required. You can just
read my lectures and follow the class discussion. However, you
will get more out of the course if you also do reading.
Throughout the week, you will be able to raise questions, make
comments, etc. And I will respond to your comments/messages when
I post the next week's lecture. All substantive issues should be
referred to me. All technical questions about communicating
online should go to the ZBBS system operator.</p>

<p>Between now and Sunday, when I return, it would be nice if
those of you who are planning to take the course could
&quot;introduce&quot; yourselves, with a short discussion of who
you are and your interest in the topic of consumerism. </p>

<p>I look forward to &quot;meeting&quot; all of you. Juliet Schor </p>

<H1>Welcome to the Web!</H1>
</CENTER>

<p>The Wilderness Society has its own web site, <a
href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/">WildernessNet</a>,
and its own interactive online telecommunications system called <a
href="http://www.wol.shareworld.com/"">Wilderness
On Line</a>. We hope you will regularly visit the former, and join the
latter. (Just click the names to check out the sites.) Here, however, we
would like to provide some general instructions on using the Web and some guides
to worthy Web destinations.

<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The
Web is simply a
large number of pages of text and graphics that are linked together with
<b>hyperlinks</b>.
Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that
an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link:
<a href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/"">WildernessNet</a>).
And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links.
Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to
follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers,
like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about
clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the
Web.

<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some
links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever you
click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come
back here by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option
on your browser.

<p>If you want to create your own web pages or create your own site, you
need to understand a little about the underlying language of Web design.
Here are some good places to begin:</p>

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>

<p>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in
mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for related
sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new
links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by

<h3>Course Catalog for ...</h3>
<h2>Semester 1: February 1995</h2>
<hr>
<h3>U.S. FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Noam Chomsky &amp; Stephen R. Shalom</strong> </p>
<p>There is a mainstream consensus on U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War which fails in 
one crucial respect: it is utterly false--false as description and false as explanation. This 
course will provide an alternative analysis of U.S. foreign policy since World War II, trying 
to illuminate the actual record and the ways in which policy has been rooted in the structures 
of U.S. society. The examination of the historical patterns should facilitate understanding of 
current-day policies and those we can expect in the future. Topics to be covered will include 
U.S.-Soviet contention, Vietnam, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Middle East, Central 
America, and the end of the Cold War, the Gulf War, Somalia, and Haiti. Readings will be 
provided online. </p>
<hr>
<h3>TIME, WORK, AND MONEY: U.S. CONSUMERISM </h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Juliet Schor</strong> </p>
<p>Consumerism has found fertile ground in the United States: malls are now the main public 
space, commercials saturate our culture, and kids kill for sneakers. Savings rates have been 
falling and millions of American are deeply in debt. In this course we will take a critical 
look at consumerism, trying to understand where it came from, where it's headed, and how 
people are resisting it. </p>
<p>We will explore the various contexts of consumer society: its history; connections to work, 
including the &quot;work and spend&quot; cycle; time use and consumerism; social processes such as 
&quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;; consumption and addiction; the environmental impacts of 
consumerism; the globalization of consumer culture; and anti-consumerist movements. The 
course will draw on economics, sociology, history, and other fields. </p>
<hr>
<h3>CONCEPTUALIZING A BETTER ECONOMY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Michael Albert</strong> </p>
<p>People opposed to exploitation, alienation, ecological degradation and the many other ills 
that characterize contemporary economic life are often asked--OK, so what are you for? This 
course is devoted to developing answers to this question. We will not present a set of 
answers, fait accompli. We will instead together develop the conceptual tools and insights 
prerequisite to developing answers, only later using these to develop and evaluate some 
competing models for what a better economy might be like. Along the way we will develop a 
participatory economic vision and evaluate social democratic as well as market and centrally 
planned post capitalist alternatives. </p>
<hr>
<h3>INTRO TO POLITICAL ECONOMY</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Robin Hahnel</strong> </p>
<p>What is economic activity? Economic efficiency? What types of economic institutions exist 
and what are their effects? What are classes and how do they affect societies and economies? 
How do individual capitalist economies differ: U.S., Swedish, Japanese, French. What are 
the defining features of non-capitalist economies (Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, 
Yugoslavia)? How do markets work? How do we evaluate them? How do they impact on the 
ecology, on people's lives and development? What is going on when the U.S. government 
uses fiscal and monetary policies to influence the economy? What social and economic 
motives are at work in debates about health care, full employment, welfare, etc. and in efforts 
to affect interest rates, employment levels and other economic indices? How do trade and 
foreign investment affect economies? These and other issues having to do with contemporary 
economic life will be our focus. </p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h3>ELECTRONIC ACTIVISM ON THE INTERNET </h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Harel Barzilai</strong></p>
<p>In this course students use the Internet as a tool with which to explore this very medium. We 
explore the Internet as a communication and information resource generally, and as a tool for 
'electronic activism' in particular. Participants learn about email, automated email-servers, 
mailing lists and list-servers, the UseNet (the world's largest bulletin board system) ftp, 
gopher, telnet, the world wide web, and more. Homework exercises (optional, of course) 
allow participants to make this as 'hands-on' an experience as they choose. <br>
<br>
In addition to learning the 'tools of the trade' of electronic activism, we compare and discuss 
their relative advantages and disadvantages for everything from coalition-building to 
electronic leafleting. We also explore the &quot;online culture&quot;, especially on the noncommercial 
and quasi-anarchic UseNet, including how UseNet and the radical &quot;GNU&quot; project have 
provided, online, living proof of the power of cooperative rather than competitive 
economics.<br>
<br>
We conclude by discussing the tremendous potentials, as well as pitfalls, ahead of us on the 
'information super-highway' -- from privatization and commercialization, to the great 
potential of democratizing the airwaves through internet 'virtual broadcasting' radio (and 
eventually TV) stations beaming left/activist programs directly into America's homes. </p>

<h3>A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE U.S.</h3>
<p><strong>Faculty: Howard Zinn</strong> </p>
<p>This course will be based on a reading of Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United 
States, and a dialogue with the author. As Zinn writes in the introductory chapter. &quot;...in that 
inevitable taking of sides which comes from selection and emphasis in history, I prefer to try 
to tell the story of the discovery of America from the viewpoint of the Arawaks, of the 
Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, 
of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish, of the Mexican War as seen by the deserting 
soldiers of Scott's army, of the rise of industrialism as seen by the young women in the 
Lowell textile mills, of the Spanish-American War as seen by the Cubans, the conquest of the 
Philippines as seen by black soldiers on Luzon, the Gilded Age as seen by southern farmers, 
the First World War as seen by socialists, the Second World War as seen by pacifists, the 
New Deal as seen by blacks in Harlem, the postwar American empire as seen by Peons in 
Latin America. </p>

On Line</a>. We hope you will regularly visit the former, and join the
latter. (Just click the names to check out the sites.) Here, however, we
would like to provide some general instructions on using the Web and some guides
to worthy Web destinations.

<p>If you are new to the World Wide Web, <b>don't be intimidated!</b> The
Web is simply a
large number of pages of text and graphics that are linked together with
<b>hyperlinks</b>.
Most browsers (the programs you use to navigate the Web) indicate that
an element of text is a hyperlink by underlining it (as in the link:
<a href="http://www.wildernessnet.shareworld.com/"">WildernessNet</a>).
And many graphic elements (if your browser displays them) are also links.
Graphical browsers, like Netscape and Microsoft Explorer, allow you to
follow links just by clicking on them with the mouse. Text based browsers,
like Lynx, let you follow links using your keyboard. Don't worry about
clicking on links you're not sure of -- you can't cause any harm to the
Web.

<p>Although the easiest way to learn is by doing, here is a list of some
links to starting points for learning more about browsing. Whenever you
click on a link you will go to the associated site. You can always come
back here by using the back up a page option or the Return to Home option
on your browser.

<h2 align=center>Starting Points For Web Surfing</h2>

<p>There are two basic ways to travel the Web. You can have something in
mind that you want to find and use a search engine to look for related
sites and pages. Or you can browse by going to a site with lots of interesting
links and following those that strike your fancy, then continuing to new
links, and so on. Here we give you a start with both these approaches by

<h1 align=center>Interview Discussion &#150; Part 1 </h1>
<p>In January 1993 Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky recorded a series of conversations which were later 
distributed by <i>Z Magazine</i>. Here we present a transcription of some material from the 1993 tapes, 
essentially verbatim, in three parts. Some of the topical material is now historical, of course, but the rest is 
as timely as when first discussed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>You once wrote an essay called &quot;Responsibility and Intellectuals&quot;. Perhaps we could start by talking a 
little bit about that. First of all, what makes a person an intellectual in the first place. What is an 
intellectual?</i> </p>
<p>It's not a term I take all that seriously. Some of the most intellectual people I've met and known in my life 
were very remote from the so-called intellectual professions. Plenty of people who are called intellectual 
workers, who work with their minds, not their, say, hands, are involved in what amounts to clerical work. 
An awful lot of academic scholarship, for example, is basically a kind of clerical work. </p>
<p><i>Suppose we use the word positively.</i> </p>
<p>With a positive connotation I would want to talk about whoever it is who's thinking about things, trying to 
understand things, trying to work things out, maybe trying to articulate and express that understanding to 
others and so on. That's intellectual life. </p>
<p><i>So &quot;things&quot; could be society, it could be quarks ...</i> </p>
<p>It could be music. </p>
<p><i>It could be sports. So basically, arguably, just about everyone.</i> </p>
<p>Except that an awful lot of the activity of most of us is routine, not considered, not directed to problems that 
really do concern us and not based on efforts, maybe even opportunities to gain deeper understanding. </p>
<p><i>So intellectuals have a whole lot of time to do this part of life that we all do some of the time.</i> </p>
<p>There are people who are privileged enough to be able to spend an awful lot of their time and effort on these 
things if they so choose. They rarely do. They often do turn to routine kind of hack work, which is the easy 
way. </p>
<p><i>So supposing a society like ours does give some people the opportunity to spend more time doing 
intellectual work, then I guess that's the context in which we raise the question, What's the responsibility 
of a person like that, a person who is free to have that time?</i> </p>
<p>We can distinguish what we you might call their &quot;task&quot; from their moral responsibility. Their task, that is, the 
reason why social institutions provide them with this time and effort, their task is, say, so that they can 
support power, authority, they can carry out doctrinal management. They can try to ensure that others 
perceive the world in a way which is supportive of existing authority and privilege. That's their task. If they 
stop performing their task, they're likely to be deprived of the opportunities to dedicate themselves to 
intellectual work. On the other hand, their moral responsibility is quite different, in fact, almost the opposite. 
Their moral responsibility is to try to understand the truth, to try to work with others to come to an 
understanding of what the world is like, to try to convey that to other people, help them understand, and lay 
the basis for constructive action. That's their responsibility. But of course there is a conflict. If you pursue 
the responsibility, you're likely to be denied the privileges of exercising the intellectual effort. </p>
<p>It's pretty evident, not hard to understand. If you're a young person, say, in college or in journalism or for that 
matter a fourth grader, and you have too much of an independent mind, meaning you're beginning to fulfill 
your responsibility, there is a whole variety of devices that will try to deflect you from that error and, if you 
can't be controlled, to marginalize and eliminate you some way. In fourth grade you may be a behavior 
problem. In college you may be irresponsible and erratic and not the right kind of student. If you make it to 
the faculty you'll fail in what's sometimes called &quot;collegiality,&quot; getting along with your colleagues. If you're a 
young journalist and you're pursuing stories that the managerial level above you understands, either 
intuitively or explicitly, are not to be pursued, you can be sent off to the police desk and advised that you are 
not thinking through properly and how you don't have proper standards of objectivity and so on. There's a 
range of devices. We live in a free society, so you're not sent to the gas chambers. They don't send the death 
squads after you, as is commonly done in many countries ... you don't have to go very far away to see that, 
say in Mexico. But there nevertheless are quite successful devices to ensure that doctrinal correctness is not 
seriously infringed upon. </p>
<p><i>But certainly intellectuals aren't only journalists, economists, political scientists and the like. That's one 
set in the social sciences. But then there's also hard scientists. There's biologists and physicists and the 
like. There it would seem that there's less of a social control problem, and so maybe you get a different 
kind of behavior. Are the intellectuals in the linguistics department comparable to the intellectuals in the 
economics department?</i> </p>
<p>First of all, there <i>is</i> a social control problem. It's just that we've transcended it. Galileo faced it, for 
example. You go back a couple of centuries in the West and the social control problem was very severe. 
Descartes is alleged to have destroyed the final volume of his treatise on the world, the one that was 
supposed to deal with the human mind, because he learned of the fate of Galileo. That's something like the 
death squads. The Inquisition was doing precisely that. Okay, that's past, in the West, at least. Not 
everywhere. </p>
<p><i>Why is it past? In other words, what is it about a society in the West that enables at least that kind of 
pursuit of knowledge to be free to go wherever it goes, but not in, say, Moslem society?</i> </p>
<p>There are a number of reasons. One of them is just increase in freedom and enlightenment. We've become a 
much freer society than we were in absolutist times. Popular struggles over centuries have enlarged the 
domain of freedom. Intellectuals have often played a role in this, during the Enlightenment, for example, in 
breaking barriers and creating a space for greater freedom of thought. That often took a lot of courage and 
quite a struggle. And it goes on until today. But there are other factors, too. It's utilitarian. It turns out that 
with modern science, especially in the last century or two, the ability to gain deeper understanding of the 
world has interacted critically with modern economic development, modern power. In fact, the course of 
science and the course of military endeavors is very close, way back to Archimedes. Archimedes was after 
all designing devices for military purposes. And military technology and science, their history closely 
interweaves in the modern period, particularly since the mid-nineteenth century. The sciences have actually 
begun to contribute materially to industrial development. So there are utilitarian purposes, but I wouldn't 
overexaggerate them. It's like the kind of result that led to freedom in other domains, like slavery, let's say. 
Or after a hundred and fifty years of American history women were allowed to vote. Things like that. These 
are significant. </p>
<p>Back to the point, especially after the great scientific revelations of the seventeenth century, it got to the point 
where you simply couldn't do science if you were subjected to the doctrinal controls that are quite effective 
outside the hard sciences. You can't do it. You try to be a physicist after Newton spinning off ideological 
fanaticism, and you're just out of the game. Progress was too much. It's striking. You can see it right here in 
Cambridge. I've lived here almost all my adult life. There are two major academic institutions only a couple 
of miles apart. One of them is science and technology based, MIT. The other has sciences of course, but the 
tone of it is basically humanities and social sciences, Harvard. And the atmosphere is radically different. </p>
<p>In fact, there is a funny problem in the natural sciences. That is that there is an internal conflict. The goal, and 
in fact what you're being paid for, to put is crassly, why you're being given the opportunities, is to find out 
the truth about the world. And you can't do that under doctrinal constraints. So there's a tension. On the one 
hand it just <i>has</i> to be free, and it just has to encourage independent thought. On the other hand, people with 
power and authority want it to be constrained. That contradiction is much more striking in the natural 
sciences than it is in the social sciences or humanities. You can tell falsehoods forever there. </p>
<p><i>But that implies that in the social sciences and economics and so on, to be crass, what they're being paid 
for is not to find the truth but something else.</i> </p>
<p>They are performing their role as long as they provide ideological services. To make it simple, take, say, 
modern economic theory, with its sort of free-market ideology. Planners in business and government are not 
going to waste their time following those rules. So the U.S. has a steel industry because it radically violated 
those rules. It was able to recover its steel industry in the last ten years under allegedly free-market doctrine 
by barring all imports from abroad, by destroying labor unions, so you could wipe down wages, and just a 
couple of days ago by slamming tariffs up to over 100% on foreign steel. That's planning. On the other hand, 
the free-market ideology is very useful. It's a weapon against the general population here because it's a 
weapon against social spending. It's a weapon against poor people abroad, saying, You guys have to follow 
these rules. As long as the economists are providing what looks like an intellectual basis for this ideology, 
they're doing their job. You don't have to pay attention to them for actual planning. You can't do that with 
physics. </p>
<p><i>How does it happen? Here we have students who finish undergraduate work and decide they want to be 
an economist. So they go to, let's say, Harvard or MIT or some other school in economics. Presumably 
when they come in they have some notion of doing something that's relevant to society, to making life a 
little better, something like that, at least a reasonable number of them. When they come out, they're 
either going to teach at some small community college or they've learned the correct lesson. But no one 
gets up in front of the class and says, We will henceforth serve the interests of capital.</i> </p>
<p>It happens in a lot of ways. Let me tell you a story I once heard from a black civil rights activist who came 
up to Harvard Law School and was there for a while. This must have been twenty years ago. He once gave a 
talk and said that kids were coming in to Harvard Law School with long hair and backpacks and social 
ideals and they were all going to go into public service, law and change the world. That's the first year. He 
said around April the recruiters come for the summer jobs, the Wall Street firms. Get a cushy summer job 
and make a ton of money. So the students figure, What the heck? I can put on a tie and jacket and shave for 
one day, because I need that money and why shouldn't I have it? So they put on a tie and a jacket for that one 
day and they get the job for the summer. Then they go off for the summer and when they come back in the fall, 
it's ties and jackets and obedience and a shift of ideology. </p>
<p><i>Sometimes it takes two years.</i> </p>
<p>Sometimes it takes two years; that's overdrawing the point. But those factors are very influential. I've fought 
it all my life. It's extremely easy to be sucked into the dominant culture. It's very appealing. And the people 
don't look like bad people. You don't want to sit there and insult them. You try to be friends, and you are. 
You begin to conform, to adapt, to smooth off the harsher edges. Education at a place like Harvard is in fact 
largely geared to that, to a remarkable extent. I was a graduate student there. There was an organization 
called the Society of Fellows, which is a research outfit that selects a couple of people from all fields over 
the year. It was a remarkable opportunity to work. You had all the facilities of Harvard available and 
basically no responsibilities. Your only responsibilities were to show up for a dinner every Monday night 
which was sort of modelled on the Oxford-Cambridge high table. You spent the evening at the dinner with a 
couple of senior faculty members and other distinguished people. The purpose of that was basically 
socialization. You had to learn how to drink port and how to have polite conversations without talking about 
serious topics, but of course indicating that you could talk about serious topics if you were so vulgar as to 
actually do it. There's a whole set of mannerisms. In those days you had to learn how to wear British clothes. 
That was the appropriate affectation. </p>
<p><i>And it's very rare for a person to do all that and not begin to rationalize and think, This is really pretty 
good. Aren't I something for all this? And to begin to be impressed</i>. </p>
<p>It kind of seeps in. They've had, for example, back in the early forties ... in the 1930s of course there was 
pretty big labor strife and labor struggle and it scared the daylights out of the business community because 
labor was actually winning the right to organize and even legislative victories. There were a lot of efforts to 
overcome this. Harvard played its role. It introduced a trade union program which brought in rising young 
people in the labor movement, the guy who looks like he's likely to be the local president next year. They're 
brought to Harvard, they sit in the business school and the dorms. They go through a socialization process. 
They're brought to share some of the values and an understanding of the elite. They're taught, our job is to 
work together. We all are together. There are two lines. One line, for the public, is, we're all together. We're 
all cooperating, joint enterprise, harmony and so on. Of course, meanwhile, business is fighting a vicious 
class struggle on the side, but that's in a different corner of the universe. That effort to socialize and integrate 
union activists, I've never measured its success, but I'm sure it was successful. It's pretty much the way what 
I experienced and saw what a Harvard education. There's much less of that at MIT, naturally, for exactly the 
reason you said: They're not training the people who are going to rule. </p>
<p><i>It reminds me of 180 degrees opposite, when people started to become politicized in the early and 
mid-sixties there was an intellectual component that was trying to understand society. There was a whole 
set of lifestyle acts, ranging from long hair to having a mattress on the floor to various other kinds of 
behavioral traits. Most parents were sophisticated enough to get much more upset about the lifestyle acts 
than about the ideas that were being phrased. Because they had a tremendous tenacity. Once you had a 
community that had these lifestyle ways of behaving and ways of getting along and ways of identifying 
one another and being part of the same thing, you could escape the more mainstream behaviorisms far 
more easily. You could look at the accepted roles as being silly or false or whatever, and it was no longer 
so attractive. That has been absent since about 1970. I don't think the left has had anything much to 
compete with, the sort of general life definitions of the mainstream and the right. So o the left you don't 
have a strong lifestyle and an identity to make it easy to ignore the seductions. What you have is ideals 
but no counteridentity.</i> </p>
<p>That's partly because the alternative lifestyle simply was commercialized and absorbed into the mainstream 
culture, selling clothes and that sort of thing. </p>
<p><i>That was part of it. It was also partly because the alternative lifestyle was never the wonderful lifestyle it 
was cut out to be. Instead of defining something positively, it was defined as the opposite of what is. The 
opposite of something that's horrible isn't always so wonderful. So there were many components of the 
way we lived and acted in the late sixties that were not very well conceived as ways to live and act over a 
long period of time. They worked for a time, but over the longer haul they often just weren't very 
fulfilling.</i> </p>
<p>What you're saying is no doubt true. The thing has been commercialized and cheapened. Still, life's a lot 
easier than it was forty years ago. If I think back to those days, if I look at pictures from the early 1960s, I 
can hardly believe it, how disciplined everything was, how deep the authority structures were just in 
personal relations, the way you looked and talked when you went out with your friends. There's been very 
significant ... I think very good changes as a result of what took place in the 1960s that in turn spread around 
the whole society. Maybe the spread of some of the gains meant that young dissidents couldn't identify 
themselves so easily, but it's in part because the society got better. </p>
<p><i>But it's distracting and sort of disturbing. I mean, it's true, and when I talk to students I try to convey the 
difference between a time when everybody thought that every lawyer was honest and forthright and 
deserved obedience and so on and that doctors were out for nothing except to help humanity, that 
business people cared about consumers, and so on, to a time, now, when people know much more than 
that, to a time, now, when people are sort of passive and laid back. But then it's distracting that with 
those changes you don't have a parallel change in an organized and aware, self-conscious and critically 
aware left. On the one hand we do have a lot of left activists. But we don't have something that is a 
national left.</i> </p>
<p>I agree with you, of course. But it seems to me what's happened, as I try to understand what's happened since 
the sixties, is that there has been among the general population, excluding those who are considered 
responsible intellectuals, meaning the ones filling their tasks, excluding power structures and the 
intellectuals who serve their interests, for the general population, there has been something of almost a 
revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level and so on, and a great improvement. It has taken no 
institutional form at all. On the one hand, the ideological institutions are firmly in the hands of the extremely 
narrow liberal-to-reactionary spectrum, and very tightly controlled. There's no identifiable point of view or 
ways of thinking or by and large even journals outside them, very little. On the other hand, the general 
population has become extremely dissident and has absorbed many of the values that people were struggling 
for in the sixties, and you can see it in just about every area. </p>
<p><i>But the thing that seems to be missing is that then people thought that you could win a change.</i> </p>
<p>I think they <i>did</i> win a change. </p>
<p><i>Yes, but it was in considerable part because they also believed they could, understood they could. But 
now people tend not to believe they can, and so have little incentive to try.</i> </p>
<p>I don't think they've recognized what changes are already achieved. If you take almost any area you think of, 
whether it's race or sex or military intervention, the environment--these are all areas of awareness and 
concern that didn't exist in the early sixties. You didn't even think about them. You just submitted, without 
even knowing that you were submitting. You just accepted. And people don't any more. Take the original sin 
of American history: what happened to the native population. It's a remarkable fact that until the 1960s the 
culture simply couldn't come to terms with it. Not at all. When I grew up, I would go out with my friends and 
we'd play cowboys and Indians and shoot the Indians. Scholarship was the same. Until the 1960s, with very 
rare exceptions, academic scholarship was grossly falsifying the history, suppressing the reality of what 
happened. Even the number of people was radically falsified. As late as 1969, in one of the leading 
diplomatic histories of the United States, the author Thomas Wally could write that after the Revolution &quot;the 
colonists turned to the task of felling trees and Indians.&quot; Nobody could say that now. You couldn't even say 
that in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial. Those are really important changes. </p>
<p><i>But somehow it's as if, in a phrase I once heard, we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. People have 
this perception of accomplishing nothing or very, very little, and begin to get burned out and to retain 
some of the values and commitments but begin to feel that you can no longer really struggle for change 
bcause we're not succeeding. This is a common sentiment. It's certainly a common sentiment among 
people I know, not always voiced, I think, but there. And yet if you look objectively at the thing, like 
you're trying to do now, you see that if you don't have an outrageously inflated view of how fast change 
takes place, then you can understand that change has been dramatic. It isn't so obvious what the 
mechanism is that causes people to be so oblivious to their own effects.</i> </p>
<p>Partly it's that there's nothing in the official culture that's ever going to tell you you succeeded. It's always 
going to tell you you failed. The official view of the sixties is it's a bunch of crazies running around burning 
down universities and making noise because they were hysterics or were afraid to go to Vietnam or 
something. That's the official story. That's what people hear. They may know in their lives and experience 
that that's not what happened. But they don't hear anybody say it, unless they're in activist groups. That 
change is possible, that it has been won, is not the message that the system is pouring into you through 
television and radio and newspapers and books and histories and so on. It's sort of beating into your head 
another story. The other story is you failed, and you should have failed, because you were just a bunch of 
crazies. And it's natural that the official culture should take that view. It does not want people to understand 
that you can make changes. That's the last thing it wants people to understand. So, what the mainstream media 
conveys is that if there have been changes, it's because we, the elites, are so great that we carried through the 
changes. </p>
<p><i>But there's an element of truth in that, though perverse. Of course, short of a revolution any change that 
occurs is going to occur how? Immediately, because an elite makes a decision to enact a change. They're 
going to make the decision because of the pressures of social movements. But they are in a position to 
deny the influence of the movements and claim credit for themselves down the road a ways.</i> </p>
<p>But really, they bowed to pressures. </p>
<p><i>That's right. When you read the histories, they don't talk about the pressures from social movements. 
Instead elites simply talk about their profound wisdom in taking this next step.</i> </p>
<p>We ended slavery because we were such great figures that we decided that we didn't like slavery. </p>
<p><i>And the real cause of it is gone.</i> </p>
<p>Let's say the slave revolts. </p>
<p><i>That's gone</i>. </p>
<p>And sure, we saw that on a not trivial scale in the last thirty years. So this combination of a kind of a, in my 
opinion, really close to revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level has gone on without any 
lasting institutional change. </p>
<p>And the lack of institutional support for the changes in ideas and values allows the official culture to drive 
home its message, which is, you guys are worthless and can't do anything, why don't you just shut up and go 
home? And steadily they undermine the progress. </p>
<p><i>I want to go into some of that when we talk about movements and what should happen. But let's just go 
back to this broad question of intellectuals. What about left intellectuals? If an intellectual is somebody 
who spends time trying to understand, and a social intellectual tries to understand society, what's a left 
intellectual? Are there any?</i> </p>
<p>I've never been very happy about words like &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right,&quot; but let's use it in the conventional sense. One 
of the very few predictions in the social sciences that I know of that ever came true was one of Bakunin's 
over a century ago in which he talked about what the intellectuals were going to be like in modern industrial 
society. He predicted that they would fall into two categories. There would be the left intellectual. They 
would be the ones who would try to rise to power on the backs of mass popular movements, and if they 
could gain power they would then beat the people into submission. </p>
<p><i>Leninism.</i> </p>
<p>Yes, what he was predicting was Leninism. And if the inelletuals find that they can't do that, or that it is too 
dangerous or costly, they'll be the servants of what we would nowadays call state capitalism. He didn't use 
the term. Either of the two intellectuals, he said, will be &quot;beating the people with the people's stick.&quot; That is, 
they will still be presenting themselves as representatives of the people, so they'll hold the people's stick, 
but they'll be beating the people with it. He didn't go on with this, but I think that his analysis has turned out 
to be true. And it follows from his analysis that it would likely be extremely easy to shift from one position 
to the other. It's extremely easy, that is, to undergo what nowadays is called the &quot;God-that-failed&quot; syndrome. 
You start off as basically a Leninist, someone who is going to be part of the Red bureaucracy. You see later 
that power doesn't lie that way, and you very quickly become an ideologist of the right and you devote your 
life to exposing the sins of your former comrades who haven't seen the light and haven't shifted to where 
power really is. In fact, we're seeing it right now in the Soviet Union. The same guys who were Communist 
thugs, Stalinist thugs two years back, are now running banks and enthusiastic free marketeers and praising 
Americans. </p>
<p><i>It doesn't take a long indoctrination period to learn the new style.</i> </p>
<p>And this has been going on for forty years. It's become a kind of a joke. Where does that leave what you 
might call &quot;honest intellectuals&quot;? They're usually outside the system, for good reasons. There is no reason to 
expect institutions of power and domination to tolerate people trying to undermine them. Quite the opposite. 
So therefore you quite typically find the honest and serious intellectuals, people who are commited to, I 
think, enlightenment values, values of truth, freedom, liberty, and justice, there would be major efforts made 
to marginalize them. </p>
<p><i>Who are they?</i> </p>
<p>All the people who have done anything that's ... </p>
<p><i>Who, which people, groups?</i> </p>
<p>Take, say, the SNCC activists. They were serious intellectuals. They made a big change in the world. The 
people of your generation, who did the work that led to the changes we spoke of earlier... work that didn't 
just mean running around the streets waving signs. It also meant thinking about things and figuring out what 
the problems were. Those people made a change. A certain number of them did filter their way into the 
institutions. For example, if you take universities or newspapers or television today, you usually find people 
in there, almost always, who have been through those experiences and have remained true to them. They've 
got to adapt their behavior in various ways to get by. But many of them do it very self-consciously, very 
honestly and even very constructively. So there's a kind of an honest intelligentsia if you like, meaning not 
serving power, either as Red bureaucracy or as state capitalist, commissar equivalents. Such people exist, 
sometimes in the institutions, but most of the time out of them, for almost trivial reasons. The institutions are 
simply not going to welcome serious critics. They're constructed in such a way as to make it difficult or 
impossible for people who are going to undermine those institutions to survive. How could it be otherwise? 
It's just like you're not going to find a militant labor activist as chairman of the board of General Electric. 
How could it be? </p>
<p><i>It seems straightforward to me as well. But we come to the question, are there some left intellectuals who 
rise to a position of relative prominence, so they're visible. SNCC activists are anonymous, in a sense, 
socially anonymous.</i> </p>
<p>They're marginalized, but they're important. Some of them are still around, doing important things. </p>
<p><i>But in a sense it's an activist group who is not highlighted and made publicly visible. And some leaders 
might be.</i> </p>
<p>Like Rosa Luxemburg, say, who got killed. </p>
<p><i>Right. So there's a figure in history who we could say, She's one of the people who I would pick...</i> </p>
<p>She was murdered. That's the point. </p>
<p><i>Typical. This raises the question, Can we only find dead ...?</i> </p>
<p>No. First of all, if you look back through history ... </p>
<p><i>Let's look now.</i> </p>
<p>Now? You find people all over. It's claimed now that there's less of a left intelligentsia than there was thirty 
years ago. I don't believe a word of it. Take a look at the people who they're calling the left, the big thinkers 
of the 1950s. Who were they? They were intelligent people. Ed Wilson is an intelligent person, but a left 
intellectual? Mary McCarthy? A smart person who wrote some nice novels. But not a left intellectual. In 
fact, what you have now is much more serious activists in many more places. I travel all the time and give 
talks all over the place. I've been amazed to go to places throughout the 1980s ... take, say, the Central 
America solidarity movement, which I think is a pretty dramatic development. I don't think there's been 
anything like it in history. I'd go to a church in Kansas or a town in Montana or Wyoming or Anchorage, 
Alaska and find people who knew more about Latin America, certainly, than the CIA, which is not very hard, 
but people in academic departments who've thought about it, who understood things about American policy. </p>
<p>I can't even tell you their names. There are too many of them. Also, I'm not even sure that the word &quot;left&quot; is 
the right word for them. A lot of them were probably Christian conservatives, but they were very radical 
people in my view. Intellectuals who understood and who did a lot. They created a popular movement which 
not only protested U.S. atrocities but actually engaged themselves in the lives of the victims. In the 1960s 
nobody ever dreamt of going off to a Vietnamese village because maybe a white face in the village would 
limit the capacity of the marauders to kill and destroy. That wasn't even an idea in your head. In fact, nobody 
even went to try to report the war from the side of the victims. It was unheard of, save for a few &quot;crazies.&quot; 
But in the eighties it was common. And the people who were doing that are serious left intellectuals, in my 
view. </p>
<p><i>So if a person comes along and says the left intellectual community is gutted, there's very little of it, what 
they must in fact be saying is something like--the number of people who call themselves leftist and who 
are visibly notable is small. Which, of course, in your analysis may well be an indication that there's a 
growing left intellectual community which is, of course, being isolated and not labeled anything publicly 
and not given any public visibility.</i> </p>
<p>That's right. What will be labeled &quot;left&quot; and given publicity is something ugly enough that people can be 
rallied to oppose it. So Stalinism, for example. Books will come out, and are coming out, about the left 
intellectuals in France who were Stalinists. And look at the awful things they did. That kind of left 
intelligentsia is allowed to have publicity and prominence. They give them as much prominence as they can. </p>
<p><i>It's useful.</i> </p>
<p>But if by left you mean people who are struggling for peace and justice and freedom and human rights and so 
on, and for social change and elimination of authority structures, whether it's personal life or institutions or 
whatever, if that's what the left is, there are more of them around than I remember in my lifetime. </p>
<p><i>In coming to this kind of perception of the thing, you have a real advantage, you personally, relatively 
speaking. You personally, as compared to one of those individuals, do have a lot of the visibility and a lot 
of the access that somebody might attribute as the critical ingredient needed to impact on a wide 
audience in our society. These other people feel isolated. They feel relatively uninfluential or unable to 
express their opinions to a wider audience.</i> </p>
<p>Visibility, that's putting the cart before the horse. The reason I have visibility is because there are a lot of 
people around, a lot of groups around, who come and ask me to speak, or because people ask me to write. I 
don't have visibility in the mainstream institutions. </p>
<p><i>But there has to be a distinction between you and those people you mentioned in Omaha or Anchorage or 
wherever who may know more than you, or at least a lot, about Central America and who are never asked 
to speak.</i> </p>
<p>We pick different ways of living our lives. In the early sixties, I was an MIT professor. But when I started 
giving talks about the war or organizing tax resistance or getting involved in the foundation of RESIST, 
national resistance support groups, or being faculty advisor for the Rosa Luxemburg SDS at MIT, I didn't 
have any visibility. There are choices to be made. Some of my close friends who have the same status and 
chance for visibility that I had actually picked a different way and devoted their lives to organizing and 
activism. Louis Kampf and I are old friends. We taught courses together for years at MIT, courses which you 
took years ago. We just went different ways. He devoted himself primarily to real activism and organizing 
and keeping groups and journals functioning and so on. I tried that and I wasn't any good at it. I found that I 
was much better at other things, and that there seemed to be a demand for the other things, so I just went that 
way. That ends up in me being visible. He's visible in other circles than the ones that I'm visible in. But 
those are just different ways of reacting to the same sorts of problems, depending on your personality and 
your particular abilities and the kinds of things you can do and the kinds of things you can't do and so on and 
so forth. The visibility is a surface phenomenon. Visibility is the result of the existence of an active, lively 
left. If what I've been talking about as the left were to disappear, I would no longer be visible. </p>
<p><i>As a political commentator.</i> </p>
<p>Yes, I could still appear in linguistics and philosophy meetings, but I would certainly not be visible as a 
political commentator, because there would be nowhere for me to open my mouth except to my friends. It 
would be back to the early sixties, when I could talk to people in the living room. The reason that it has 
changed is because there are opportunities that in fact call for this kind of participation, so that makes people 
look visible. We mentioned SNCC before. Why did Martin Luther King become visible? Because there were 
SNCC workers down in the South. And he could appear and serve a role for them. </p>
<p><i>It seems to me there is a positive and negative side to that. The positive side you've described: there's a 
political context and it draws people in different ways and people participate. But the negative side 
seems to me to be, you gave the example of Martin Luther King and yourself. There's a need for a 
particular visible organizer or a particular visible speaker and proselytizer of information, a presenter 
of information. But once those slots are filled, then there's a tendency for people to cling to the 
individuals who are filling those slots. For a long period of time, depending on a number of factors, the 
number of slots might not broaden out. Nowadays if a group in Cleveland or in San Francisco or 
wherever wants an antiwar speaker during the Gulf crisis or wants a speaker about foreign policy, very 
few names pop into mind. Whereas I think you're right, there is a much larger circuit of people, 
especially if they had the experience of engaging in those activities, who could fill the bill. That seems to 
me to be not so positive a dynamic.</i> </p>
<p>It's not. It's hard to break through. There are people who we know in fact who are highly qualified to do lots 
of things and are eager to do it but sort of can't pass over that barrier. I don't know exactly what the reason 
for that is, frankly, because all of us had to pass over that barrier at some point. Part of the reason is, the fact 
of the matter is there haven't been a lot of people available. Take, say, the last ten years, when there's been a 
lot of activism, a lot of it having to do with Latin America. There just haven't been a lot of people around 
who were willing to go and give talks. There are plenty of people who are willing to write articles on 
postmodernism and the left this and that or whatever, but not many who are willing to go to a town 
somewhere and give a talk at a meeting. We can name them. </p>
<p><i>Or we can name the ones we know, but it may well be there are a good many more and we can't name 
them. That's the problem.</i> </p>
<p>There are a good many more who would be highly qualified and maybe even would like to do it. The 
question we're asking, and I don't know what the answer is, is how come they don't. First of all, I don't think 
it's all that hard. Take, say, people who weren't known very well, like Holly Sklar, who probably wasn't 
known fifteen years ago. She got plenty of invitations all over the place. She became visible. There are 
others like her. Take my friend Norman Finkelstein on the Middle East. He can get plenty of invitations to 
speak. He's been totally shut out of the institutions, but he's visible if he wants. It can be done. It's not so 
simple. </p>
<p><i>It's somewhat difficult. I do think that there's a dynamic there that closes it off.</i> </p>
<p>The bad dynamic, what you're pointing to, is the &quot;star story. It's standard when a popular movement takes off 
for people to show up and say, OK, I'm your leader. A Eugene McCarthy type, say. Here's a big popular 
movement. Fine. I'm your leader. Give me power. If you can't give me power I'll go home and write poetry 
and talk about baseball. And if you can give me power then I become your leader and now you look up to me 
and you go home and put the power in my hand. That's a familiar dynamic, and Bakunin's Red bureaucracy, 
no matter what its politics are. It could be right wing, it could be left wing. But there's a better dynamic, 
which is that the popular movements continue and strengthen, and where there are people around who, for 
whatever reason or quirk or privilege or whatever it may be, can contribute to them by intellectual activity, 
they do a part of it. That's all. They're not stars. They're not leaders. They're just contributing in the way that 
they know how to contribute. That would be a better structure. But it can tend to degenerate into this other 
very quickly, especially in a culture which is reinforcing their worst tendencies by trying to create an 
imagery of leadership and stars and heroes and so on. </p>

<p><i><tt>Suppose somebody could convince you, at the level of your belief in most things, that 
it's impossible to change the country. Suppose they convinced you that the basic 
institutional structure that we have now is going to be in place for the next two 
hundred years, adapted sure, but the basic structures as they are. Would you behave 
any differently?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Zero.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>You would behave exactly the same way.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>The same way. In fact, you don't even have to make it hypothetical. When I got 
seriously involved in anti-Vietnam War activities, I was a hundred percent convinced 
that absolutely nothing could be done, and there was plenty of reason to believe 
that. I was giving plenty of talks, but they were usually in living rooms to a group 
of neighbors that somebody would get together. They were usually pretty hostile. Or 
in a church where there would be four people including some guy who wandered in 
because he didn't know what to do, and two people who wanted to kill you, and the 
organizer. Into 1965 and 1966, if we wanted to have at MIT an antiwar meeting, we 
would have to find six topics. Let's talk about Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam and the 
price of bread, and maybe we can get an audience that will outnumber the organizers. 
And that went on for a long time. As you well remember, it was impossible to have a 
public meeting in Boston without it being smashed up. It looked impossible.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>If you thought this was going to continue forever, you would still do it. I think it 
would be useful to explain why. </tt></i></p>
<p><tt>A number of quite simple reasons. For one thing, if somebody convinced me, it would 
be because I'm totally irrational. There's no way you could convince anybody of such 
things rationally. We cannot predict the weather two weeks ahead, and we even 
understand why we can't.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>It's a hypothetical question. It gets to motivations. Obviously neither one of us 
believe it, and neither one of us believe you could prove it. You couldn't convince 
anybody rational of it.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>You couldn't say anything convincing about it.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Nevertheless, supposing because a great many people not understanding that point, do 
feel this way or tend to feel this way sometimes and get depressed at moments. The 
question is, in any event, what gets you up each morning to do the things that you 
do? Is it that you think in terms of winning a little ways down the road, or is it 
something else?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>It's hard to introspect, but to the extent that I introspect about it, it's because 
you basically have two choices. One choice is to assume the worst, and then you can 
be guaranteed that it will happen. The other is to assume that there is hope for 
change, and then it's possible that by acting you will help effect change. So you've 
got two choices. One guarantees that the worst will happen. The other leaves open the 
possibility that things might be better. Given those two choices, a rational person 
doesn't hesitate.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>I used to think about this back when I was becoming political, in the mid-sixties. I 
played the hypothetical game a little more fairly than I think you are right now. I 
said to myself, OK, suppose it's haves and have-nots. Not very many haves, a whole 
lot of have-nots. Forever. Which side do you want to be on? And it's not an easy 
question. At the time it was trivial. In the sixties, that was an easy question to 
answer. You wanted to be on the side of the have-nots regardless of prospects. I 
think this had a lot to do with lifestyle and values and who you identify with. The 
other stuff, being a have, just wasn't attractive. Now I think it's a much harder 
question. But that's one kind of motivation that people can have for being radical. 
The other kind of motivation that people can have for being radical is the 
inclination that you're going to win tomorrow or in your lifetime or in a reasonable 
span of time. It seems like the first motivation breeds a different kind of person in 
some sense than the second. They're called purists, morally motivated, ethically 
motivated, and scorned a bit by some of the other types, with some reason. 
Because--and this was the other thing that I began to realize early on--trying to 
make social change isn't like trying to play socialist basketball. In working for 
social change, the score counts. It doesn't do to play well or congenially but lose. 
The combination of both of those motivations--scorning being a have but also 
seriously wanting to win--in one person seems to me to be rather difficult.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>You mentioned two possibilities. One is a description of your own group's experience 
in the sixties. You didn't expect to win a huge victory tomorrow. Some people 
expected we'll go out and strike at Columbia ... And everybody will love each other 
and that's the end of power. We both know perfectly well that plenty of people 
believed that. There were other people who recognized it was going to be a long 
struggle but who were joining with like-minded people who shared their cultural 
values and their lifestyle and everything else. There's also a third type: You've got 
me. I was not part of the cultural scene. I certainly didn't expect a quick victory. 
I kept my old-fashioned bourgeois lifestyle, and I haven't changed it to this day. 
And there are people like that too. If we go on there are many more types of people. 
People can come in a lot of varieties. But it seems to me that it always comes down 
to the individual decision: What am I going to do? Here are my options. Of course, my 
personal options are broader than those of most other people, because I happen to be 
very privileged. But everybody's got some option. You ask yourself, Will I not use 
them at all? In which case I can be sure that suffering will continue and oppression 
will continue and discrimination will continue and get worse. Or will I use whatever 
options I have, try to work with others to change things? In which case things may 
get better. It seems to me that ultimately that's what things come down to, no matter 
who we are. And given those choices, a decent person is only going to go one way. 
That's exactly why society and the official culture doesn't want you to understand 
that you have those choices.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Is that true that a decent person's only going to go one way? I'm remembering a 
friend of mine who was an organizer in the sixties. We went through the antiwar 
movement. Then came a little bit further along and there was a trend toward doing 
community organizing, moving into a neighborhood, trying to organize people in that 
neighborhood. This individual was going to move into a neighborhood in Dorchester, in 
Boston, a working-class area and try and do organizing. He finally decided not to do 
it and somewhat later went back to graduate school and then became a psychiatrist and 
now, I'm sure, has progressive values at some level--I haven't seen him in years and 
years--but is certainly not involved in any significant way in political activity. 
The choice that he made was a very self-conscious one. He looked around him and he 
said, the impact that I personally am going to have is so small because I'm not so 
and so or so and so, he'd name some other people who had prospects of maybe in his 
eyes having more impact, because of whatever set of factors about, so that it simply 
isn't worth giving up what I think I'm giving up.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>I don't know who you mean, but I know plenty of people like that. That person now, 
let's say he's a rich psychiatrist somewhere ...</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>He's probably reasonably well off.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>He's got a lot of options. For example, he's got money.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>This is like a person going to Harvard Law School. The probability that he'll do 
something good with his income after the years of earning it...</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>I agree. But he's simply deciding at some point not to face the options. He's always 
got them. He may decide, Look, I can't make enough of a change myself because I'm not 
good at it or whatever, so I'm just going to do what I like and enrich myself. But 
having done so, you still have plenty of options available. In fact, movement groups 
have existed in part because people who were doing other things were willing to fund 
them. Something as trivial as that. You can go way beyond that, of course, and still 
live your elegant lifestyle and do the work you want. We know people who have divided 
their lives that way. Of course it's extremely easy to say, the heck with it. I'm 
just going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority and do the best I 
can within them. Sure, you can do that. But that's not acting like a decent person. 
You can walk down the street and be hungry. You see a kid eating an ice cream cone 
and you notice there's no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him 
because you're bigger and walk away. You can do that. Probably there are people who 
do. We call them &quot;pathological.&quot; On the other hand, if they do it within existing 
social structures we call them &quot;normal.&quot; But it's just as pathological. It's just the 
pathology of the general society. And people, again, always have choices. We're free 
people. You can decide to accept that pathology, but then do it honestly, at least, 
if you have that grain of honesty to say, I'm going to honestly be pathological. Or 
else try to break out of it somehow.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>But for a lot of people I think it appears that there's an all-or-nothing choice. It 
appears that there's the choice of being normal--pathological as you describe, but a 
normal member of society with its normal benefits and costs and so on, but at least a 
reasonably average or perhaps elite existence that's accepted. Then there seems to be 
another &quot;all&quot; choice, to be a raging revolutionary. The reason why it's so hard for 
many people even just to take a leaflet from a protester, or to give a donation at a 
relatively low level which means nothing financially, which is less money than 
they're going to spend on dinner on Friday night when they go out, or to do some 
other act that is materially trivial, seems to be because there's a psychologically 
really powerful effect. The effect seems to me to be that at some level people know 
that to dissent is right, and at some level people know that to do it somewhat leads 
to doing it still more, so they defensively close the door right at the very 
beginning. They have a very hard time finding a place in that span of possible 
involvement that allows them to be a functioning human being with a degree of 
fulfillment in society and also lets them contribute to dramatically changing 
society.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>You're right. Just giving your contribution of $100 to the Central America support 
center or whatever is a statement that you know that that's the right thing to do. 
Once you've stated it's the right thing to do, how come I'm only doing this limited 
thing since I could do a million times more? It's easier to say, I'm not going to 
face that problem at all. I'm just going to forget it entirely. But that's like 
stealing the ice cream cone from the kid.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>But it says something to the left, or to movements and to organizers. It is at some 
level unreasonable to think that in the absence of hope or in the presence only of 
small hope and not a clear understanding of how one's going to make progress, that 
people are going to shift all the way from being average, normal, everyday folks of 
one type or another over to being political revolutionaries, people who see things in 
political terms. If there's no set of choices in the middle that are comfortable and 
that allow people to operate and to retain some of their lifestyle, then it's not 
likely that too many are going to do anything. You almost have to be religious to 
make the jump.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>But the reality is there's a whole range of choices in the middle.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>But people don't see them.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>And all of us have made them. None of us are saints, at least I'm not. I haven't 
given up my house, my car, I don't live in a hovel. I don't spent 24 hours a day 
working for the benefit of the human race or anything like that. I don't even come 
close. I spend an awful lot of my time and energy ...</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>And you don't feel guilty about whatever else is it that you're doing, linguistics or 
...</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>That's not so clear. But at least I certainly devote an awful lot of my energy and 
activity to things that I just enjoy, like scientific work. I just like it. I do it 
out of pleasure. And everybody else I know ...</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Do you fool yourself into believing that doing that increases your effectiveness as a 
political person?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>No, that's ridiculous. It has no effect on it. And I don't do it for that reason. I 
like it. I mean, I can make up a story ...</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>I think people have a hard time doing this. And that's why a lot of people do nothing 
politically dissident.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>That's true, but if we were to go back to that small class of people who are visible, 
every one of them does this. Every single one.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Almost by definition.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Because you're not going to be effective as a political activist unless you have a 
satisfying life. There may be people who are really saints. I've never heard of one.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>By definition they're not saints, because they're getting so much satisfaction out of 
the political activity, they're not saintly at it.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Not from the political activity. It may be that the political activities themselves 
are so gratifying that's all you want to do, so you throw yourself into that. That's 
a perfectly fine thing to be. It's just that most people have other interests. They 
want to listen to music. They want to take a walk by the ocean. Any human being is 
too rich and complex to be just satisfied with these things. You have to hit some 
kind of a balance. The choices are all there. And I think you've identified precisely 
why it's psychologically difficult for people to recognize that choices are there. 
Because once you recognize that the choices are there, you're always going to be 
faced with the question, why am I not doing more? But that's the reality of life. If 
you're honest, you're always going to be faced with those questions. And there's 
plenty to do. In fact, if you look back over the last period, there's a lot of 
successes to point to. It's amazing how many successes there are if you really think 
about it. Take something which very few people have been interested in. Take the 
issue of East Timor, the massacre. I got involved in that about fifteen years ago. 
People didn't even want to hear about it. Things finally got to the point where the 
U.S. Congress barred military aid to Indonesia. That's a tremendous change. You could 
save hundreds of thousands of lives that way. How many people can look back and say, 
Look, I helped save hundreds of thousands of lives? And that's one tiny issue.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>I'm inclined to think that most of the people who are involved in that effort, 
instead of feeling elated or feeling at least a degree of satisfaction over their 
accomplishment, rather probably view it as a horrendously long campaign with very 
little achieved. It's like looking at the milk glass and saying it's half empty 
instead of half full. Except we see it empty even when it's almost full.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Suppose you're on your deathbed. How many people can look back and say, I've 
contributed to helping ... just one person not get killed?</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>I'm not disagreeing with you. I think you're right, clearly. But there's something 
that causes people, maybe it's something about our culture, to not see it.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>I'm not so convinced of this. The sixties movements, roughly speaking, were almost 
overwhelmingly young people. Young people have a notoriously short perspective. It's 
part of being twenty years old. You don't think what's going to happen tomorrow. I've 
seen it around students, around children, even. I remember myself. You don't think 
what's life going to be like twenty years from now. Your perspective is short. The 
fact that it was a youth movement dominantly had good and bad aspects. One bad aspect 
was this sense that if we don't achieve gains quickly we might as well quit. But of 
course that's not the way changes come. The struggle against slavery, let's say, went 
on forever. The struggle for women's rights has been going on for a century. The 
effort to overcome wage slavery, that's been going on since the beginnings of the 
Industrial Revolution, and we haven't advanced an inch. In fact, we are worse off 
than a hundred years ago in terms of understanding the issues. Well, OK, you just 
keep struggling.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Let's go back to one of the things that you mentioned along the way when you were 
talking about academics and what role they play and what they're doing and what their 
time goes to. You brought up briefly in passing postmodernism and these various 
other--either you can call them insightful forays into knowledge, or fads. I know, 
and probably most people listening know, at least somewhat, about your reaction to 
it. But let's go over it anyway. Where does it come from? Why does a person who has a 
tremendous amount of educational background, knowledge, experience, time to 
spend--spend it on something akin to astrology?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>I don't want to overgeneralize. I think there is important and insightful work done 
in those frameworks. I find it really hard to figure out because I've got to labor to 
try to tease the simple, interesting points out. But there are things there. I think 
we're making progress there. But I think there's a point that's much more general. 
The fact is, it's extremely hard to have good ideas. There are very few of them 
around. If you're in the sciences, you know you can sometimes come up with something 
that's pretty startling and it's usually something that's small in comparison with 
what's known and you're really excited about it. Outside the natural sciences it's 
extremely hard to do even that. There just isn't that much that's complicated that's 
at all understood outside of pretty much the core natural sciences. Everything else 
is either too hard for us to understand or pretty easy.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>So suppose you're making $50,000 a year as a academic in that field?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>You've got to have a reason for your existence. The result is that simple ideas are 
dressed up in extremely complex terminology and frameworks. In part it's just 
careerism, or maybe an effort to build self-respect. Take, say, what's called 
&quot;literary theory.&quot; I don't think there's any such thing as literary theory, any more 
than there's cultural theory.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>And obviously you can read a book and talk about it.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Yeah, if you're reading books and talking about them and getting people to ...</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>You could be very good at that.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>You could be terrific at it. Take, say, Edmund Wilson. He's terrific at it. But he 
doesn't have a literary theory. On the other hand, if you want to be in the same room 
with that physicist over there who's talking about quarks, you better have a 
complicated theory, too, that nobody can understand. He has a theory that nobody can 
understand, so why shouldn't I have a theory that nobody can understand?</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>The interesting thing is that the physicist will write about that theory in a popular 
book and explain it without a whole lot of rigmarole. It won't all be explained, but 
a great deal of it will be.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>A great physicist of the modern period could write a book that you could give to your 
twelve-year-old kid and she'll understand it and learn something from it. In fact, I 
see it myself all the time.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>What's the reason why literary theorists can't do that? Is it because there's nothing 
there?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>That's my assumption. Either there's something there that's so deep that it's a kind 
of qualitative change in human intelligence, or there isn't a lot there. And it's not 
just literary theory. If somebody came along with a theory of history, it would be 
the same. &quot;Theory&quot; would be a sort of truism. Maybe &quot;smart ideas.&quot; Somebody could 
have smart ideas and say, Why don't you look at class struggle? It's interesting. Or, 
Why don't you look at economic factors lying behind the Constitution? Pick your 
topic. Those are interesting smart ideas. But you can say them in monosyllables. And 
it's rare outside the natural sciences to find things that can't be said in 
monosyllables. There are interesting, simple ideas. They're often hard to come up 
with, and they're often extremely hard to work out. Like you want to try to 
understand what actually happened, say, in the modern industrial economy and how it 
developed the way it is. That can take a lot of work. But there isn't going to be 
anything too complex to talk about ... the theory will be extremely thin, if by 
&quot;theory&quot; we mean something with principles which are not obvious when you look at 
them from which you can deduce surprising consequences, check out the consequences, 
and then confirm the principles. You're not going to find anything like that.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>So we can imagine two libraries, a library of literary theory books, postmodernism 
and so on, and another library over here with Marxist/Leninist books in essentially 
the same building.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>I don't understand that either. I read all kinds of things which talk about 
dialectical materialism. I haven't the foggiest idea what it is.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>It's a word like &quot;postmodernism.&quot;</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>To me at least, yes. I've said this occasionally in interviews and I get long letters 
back from people saying, You don't understand. Here's what dialecticalism is.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>And it's incomprehensible again.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Either it's incomprehensible or it's true, but totally obvious. People can be 
tone-deaf, too, they can't hear music. So like maybe I'm tone-deaf about this stuff 
or something. Everything I find in these fields either seems to be interesting but 
pretty obvious, once you see it, maybe you didn't see it, somebody has to point it 
out to you. But once you see it, it's of obvious. Or else the subject is just 
incomprehensible. In other fields it's quite different. If I pick up the latest issue 
of </tt><i><tt>Physics Review</tt></i><tt>, I'm not going to understand one word. But there's two differences. 
First of all, I know perfectly well what I would have to do to get to understand. And 
in some areas, I've even done it, although I'm not particularly good at it. But I can 
do it. The other thing is what you said before: I could ask you to tell me what this 
is about. I can go to some guy in the physics department and say, Tell me, why is 
everybody excited about this stuff? And they can tell it in a way which I can 
understand and adapt it to my level of understanding and also tell me how to go on, 
if I want to. In these other areas, say, dialectical materialism, or postmodern 
literary theory, there's just no way to do either of those two things, which leads me 
to only two conclusions. Either I'm missing a gene, like tone-deafness, which is 
conceivable, or it's a way of disguising maybe interesting ideas in an 
incomprehensible framework for reasons which ultimately turn out to be careerist. I 
don't want to criticize the people for being careerists. It's hard to live in this 
world, and you want to have self-respect. That's understandable and justifiable. And 
it turns out to be true that in most domains if there are hard things to understand, 
they're way beyond us.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Another trend in thinking or in how people approach society and try and understand it 
is the approach that's called &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; which we've both encountered, of 
course. It has gained a great deal of popularity, particularly on the West Coast. I 
wonder not so much in the specific instance of, say, JFK or other conspiracies that 
are discussed, but more broadly in terms of, What's the right way, what's the most 
useful or effective way to try to understand what's going on in society and to 
prepare oneself to interact with it? Is there something about conspiracy theory as 
compared to, what? an approach emphasizing institutions and their implications? 
that's an obstacle, that represents a hindrance on understanding the world to change 
it?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>We want to find out the truth about the way things work. There are doubtless cases in 
which people get together, in fact, every example we find of planning decisions is a 
case where people got together and tried to figure something out and used their power 
or the power that they could draw from to try to achieve a result. If you like, 
that's a conspiracy. So with that definition everything that happens is a conspiracy. 
So if the Board of General Motors gets together and decides what kind of Chrysler, 
Ford, something, to produce next year, that's a conspiracy. Every business decision, 
every editorial decision ...</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Ultimately made by people.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>If my department gets together and decides who to appoint next year, okay, it's a 
conspiracy. That's not interesting. Obviously, all decisions involve people. If the 
word conspiracy is to have any sensible meaning, the question becomes whether there 
are groupings well outside the structure of the major institutions that go around 
them, hijack them, undermine them, pursue other courses without an institutional 
base, and so on.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>So that would be the notion of conspiracy theory. Things happen because these groups 
exist and do them, outside the normal structures of society.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Because these groups or subgroups act outside of the structure of institutional 
power, they are special, and we call them conspiracies. But as I look over history, I 
don't find much of that. There are some cases, like a group of Nazi generals who at 
one point thought of assassinating Hitler. That's a conspiracy. But things like that 
are real blips on the screen, as far as I can see.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Supposing there's some number of them, what do you gain from spending a lot of time 
trying to unearth them and uncover them and understand them?</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>If people want to study the group of generals who decided that it was time to get rid 
of Hitler, that's a fine topic for a monograph, or maybe somebody will write a thesis 
on it. But we're not going to learn anything about the world from it. That will show 
how the people acted in particular circumstances, etc. Fine.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>You say we're not going to learn anything about the world from it. That's true almost 
by definition. The whole idea is that these people act in a sense outside the normal 
functioning of the world, so studying them teaches us about them, but not about 
typical and recurring patterns in history.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>They were acting outside because of unusual circumstances, exactly. And what's more, 
it's only a shade away from the Board of Directors of General Motors sitting down in 
their executive suite and making their regular decisions. It's just a little bit away 
from that because they happened to depart somewhat from the major power structures. 
But we're not learning much about how the world works, in fact, nothing that 
generalizes to the next case. It's going to be historically contingent and specific. 
If you look at modern American history, where these issues have flourished, I think 
such cases are notable by their absence. At least as I read the record, it almost 
never happens. Occasionally you'll find something, like, say, the Reaganites with 
their off-the-shelf subversive and terrorist activities. But that's kind of a fringe 
operation. Probably the reason it got smashed pretty quickly is because the 
institutions are too powerful to tolerate it. Take, say, the CIA, which is considered 
the source of lots of conspiracies. We have a ton of information about them, and as I 
read the information, they're pretty loyal bureaucrats and do what they're told. As 
far as the Pentagon goes, they'll push their interests, and the services will push 
their interests, but in pretty transparent ways.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>So this is systemic, not conspiratorial. You have two arguments. One is, even if it 
exists, even if there are occasional or even frequent conspiracies, examining them is 
going to teach us about that event. Not much about history or the way things work. 
The next claim is, well, there aren't even that many in the first place.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>What they usually are is what you'd find in a big corporation, or in a faculty, or 
any other structure you're in.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>You think it's generally a normal outgrowth of the operations of an institution.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>An institution has a certain structure of power. It has certain resources. It has an 
authority structure. It fits into the general society in certain ways, and if it 
tried to break out of those ways it would be undermined and destroyed. If General 
Motors decided to become a benevolent organization and produce good cars at the 
cheapest rates with the best working conditions, they'd be out of business tomorrow. 
Somebody who isn't doing it would undermine them. There are reasons why institutions 
operate the way they do within a bigger framework. Suppose, say, Clinton, in a dream, 
was really going to behave like the British Labor Party thinks he is, namely the 
revolutionary who is going to bring about a social revolution. In one minute, bond 
prices would start to decline slightly. The interest rate would go up. The economy 
would start to collapse, and that's the end of that program. There are frameworks 
within which things happen.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>That's because he would be operating as a isolated individual with no power base, 
just because he wants to, perhaps with a few allies, a conspiracy running againts the 
grain, and getting nowhere.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>Exactly. And the people who have the power would say, I don't like that, so I'll pull 
my money out of Treasury securities and put it somewhere else. And it goes down and 
you've got a response. In fact, if he doesn't understand it, he could have read a 
front-page article in the </tt><i><tt>Wall Street Journal</tt></i><tt> a couple of weeks ago explaining it in 
simple words, just in case anybody got any ideas. But you don't have to say it. 
Everybody understands it. We have tremendous concentrations of power throughout the 
society in the economy and the political system and the ideological system. They're 
all very interlinked in all kinds of ways, but the degree of power and authority and 
domination is extraordinary. If any renegade group tried to break out of that, they 
would quickly be in trouble and cut off. You can see it happening, right at the top. 
Take, say, Nixon and Watergate. Watergate was just a triviality. In terms of the 
horrifying actions that the government carried out, Watergate isn't even worth 
laughing about. It's a tea party. It's kind of interesting to see what kind of issues 
were raised.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>A teaparty except for one thing, which is that it was aimed at elites.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>It was aimed at elites. He broke out of the normal workings of power. He called 
Thomas Watson of IBM a bad name. He tried to undermine the Democratic Party, which is 
half the business power in the country. Sure, he was called on the carpet and tossed 
out in three seconds. Not because he had violated some moral code. Essentially he was 
not attacked for the atrocities that he carried out. The FBI killed Fred Hampton in 
his administration, a straight Gestapo-style killing. That never came up at 
Watergate. Take the bombing of Cambodia, one of the most dramatic things, this thing 
called the secret bombing of Cambodia, which was &quot;secret&quot; because the press didn't 
talk about what they knew. They killed probably a couple hundred thousand people. 
They devastated a peasant society. It came up, but only in one respect: Did he tell 
Congress about it? In other words, were people with power granted their prerogatives? 
That's the only issue that came up. You can see what happens when somebody even 
marginally breaks out of the system. They're quickly put back in their box, because 
they're servants. Real power lies elsewhere.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>And even there, it's not individuals. General Motors is an institution and the people 
who run it don't have that much power either.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>The head of IBM just got tossed out. Why? They didn't have enough profit last year. 
You either do your job or you're out. Power lies elsewhere. When the American 
corporate system decided the Vietnam War wasn't worth it for them any more, they had 
gotten what they were going to get, they basically told Johnson to go back to Texas. 
He was fired. He was told, You're not going to run. Pull out. Now they have somebody 
else. Within a system that works like this, it would be pretty remarkable if there 
were anything remotely like what the various conspiracy theories conjure up. When you 
look at them, they just collapse, not surprisingly.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>With perhaps one exception: King's assassination.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>It's interesting. That's the one case where we can imagine pretty good reasons why 
somebody would want to kill him. I would not be in the least surprised if there was a 
real conspiracy behind that one, and probably a high-level one.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Assuming it was Hoover, then, the mechanism is there, the means are there, everything 
is available. Nobody would be upset in the government.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>I don't think there's been a lot of inquiry into that one. If there has I'm not aware 
of it. But that's the one very plausible case. You're absolutely right. In the case 
of the one everybody's excited about, Kennedy, nobody has ever come up with a 
plausible reason.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>It's an interesting question. Why do you think when you hear these people who believe 
in the efficacy of looking at conspiracy and trying to understand it, the amount of 
energy that goes into the Kennedy case almost can't even be measured, it's off the 
scale, but the amount of energy that goes into the King case is relatively small.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>It's a pretty dramatic contrast, because the case of the King one is prima facie very 
plausible. The case of the Kennedy one is prima facie extremely implausible. So it is 
a question that you want to ask.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>Perhaps if you have a conspiracy approach to things, the more implausible it is, the 
more outside of the normal grain it is, the more of a conspiracy it is, the more 
attractive it is to you. I don't know.</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>There are things in a way conspiring to make the Kennedy case an attractive topic. 
One is just the glitter of Camelot. The Kennedy administration was in many ways very 
similar to the Reagan administration in power.</tt> </p>
<p><i><tt>The glitter of Camelot is specks of blood...</tt></i> </p>
<p><tt>But the point is that the Kennedy administration did one smart thing. They buttered 
up the intellectual class, as compared with the Reaganites, who just treated them 
with contempt. The result was they got a terrific image. They gave an appearance of 
sharing power that was never real to the kind of people who write books and articles 
and make movies and that sort of thing. The result is that Camelot had a beautiful 
image, lovely imagery, and there's been great efforts to maintain that image. Somehow 
they succeeded in getting a lot of people to believe it. You can go down to the 
South, to a poor, rural, black area and you'll find a picture of Kennedy. In fact, 
Kennedy's role in the civil rights movement was not pretty. But somehow the imagery 
succeeded, even if the reality wasn't there. And it's certainly true that a lot of 
things have gone wrong in the last twenty, twenty-five years. Plenty of things have 
gone wrong, for all sorts of totally independent reasons, which one can talk about. 
The civil rights movement made great achievements, but it never lived up to the hopes 
that many people had invested in it. The antiwar movement made achievements, but it 
didn't end war. Real wages have been declining for twenty years. A lot of things have 
been happening that aren't pretty. And it's easy to fall into the belief that we had 
a hero and we had a wonderful country and we had this guy who was going to lead us to 
a better future ... we had the Messiah and </tt><i><tt>they</tt></i><tt> shot him down and ever since then 
everything's been illegitimate.</tt> </p>

<h1 align=center>Albert /Chomsky (1993)</h1>
<h1 align=center>Interview Discussion &#150; Part 3 </h1>
<p>In January 1993 Michael Albert and Noam Chomsky recorded a series of conversations which were later 
distributed by <i>Z Magazine</i>. Here we present a transcription of some material from the 1993 tapes, 
essentially verbatim, in three parts. </p>
<p><i>I remember when I was organizing in the sixties and also since, thought it is harder to elicit when less 
seems to be at stake, I would frequently encounter a view lying behind people's reticence to act or to 
become part of political movements. The view was basically that human nature is corrupt, egotistical, 
self-centered, anti-social and that as a result of that, society would always be haves and have-nots, 
oppressors and oppressed, hierarchical and so on. I'd often find that in organizing you could get 
agreement on the inhumanity of a particular system or the illegality or injustice of, say, the war or some 
set of policies, more recently, but that people would refrain from becoming active around it because of a 
sense of hopelessness having to do with this view of human nature. It may have been just an excuse, and 
it may be just a last line of defense against becoming active, but still, in order to deal with it you have to 
address the claim. So I'm wondering ...</i> </p>
<p>There is a sense in which the claim is certainly true. There certainly is something ... human nature, that we 
all have. First of all, it is something we don't know much about. Doubtless there is a rich and complex human 
nature, and doubtless it's largely genetically determined, like everything else. But we don't know what it is. 
However, there's enough evidence from history and experience to show that it is certainly at least consistent 
with everything you mentioned. </p>
<p><i>Since we have had the phenomena, of course they can exist alongside human nature. </i></p>
<p>More than that. We know that human nature, and that includes our nature, yours and mine, can easily turn 
people into quite efficient torturers and mass murderers and slave drivers and so on. We know that. You 
don't have to look very far. But what does that mean? Should we therefore not try to stop torture? If we see 
somebody beating a child to death, should we say, well, you know, that's human nature? Which it is, in fact, 
an emergence of behavior based on the combination of human nature and certain pressures and 
circumstances. There are certainly conditions under which people will act like that. But to the extent that the 
statement it true, and there is such an extent, it's just not relevant. Human nature also has the capacity to lead 
to selflessness and cooperation and sacrifice and support and solidarity and lots of other things, too. </p>
<p><i>Is there a sense in which one way of being is more consistent with human fulfillment and development 
and another way of being is somehow contrary to it? Where do values come from?</i> </p>
<p>Where do values come from? That's an interesting question. Any answer that we give is based on extremely 
little understanding, so nothing one says is very serious. But I don't see how it can fail to be true, just from 
the conditions of moral judgment it seems to me that it must be true that moral values are basically rooted in 
our nature. The reason I say that is pretty elementary. Undoubtedly, the way in which we look at things and 
judge them and assess them and so on has a significant and notable cultural factor. But that aside, we are 
certainly capable, and everyone does, of making moral judgments and and assessments and evaluations in 
entirely new situations. We do it all the time. We're constantly coming up with new situations. We may not 
consciously evaluate them, but we certainly are at least tacitly doing it. It's the basis for our choice of action. 
So we're constantly making all kinds of judgments, including moral judgments and esthetic judgments and all 
sorts of others about new things and new situations. Either it's being done just randomly, like you pull 
something out of a hat, which certainly doesn't seem to be true, either introspectively or by observation, or 
else we're doing it on the basis of some moral system that we have in our mind somehow which gives 
answers, or at least partial answers, to a whole range of new situations. Nobody knows what that system is. 
We don't understand it at all. But it seems to be rich and complex enough that it applies to indefinitely many 
new situations. How did it get there? </p>
<p><i>What characterizes a system like this?</i> </p>
<p>Maybe it's an axiomatic system. I'm sure this is false. You could imagine it's like the axioms of number 
theory. It's a bunch of principles from which you can deduce consequences, saying this action is preferable 
to that one. I'm not making that as a serious proposal, but that would be what such a system could look like. 
Or it could be like language. </p>
<p><i>Could you make a serious proposal?</i> </p>
<p>A serious proposal I suspect is more like what we know about language. A lot is known: that there are basic 
fundamental principles that are invariant, sort of fixed in our nature. They hold for all languages. They 
provide the framework for language. They allow a certain limited degree of modification, and that 
modification comes from early experience. When the options of variation are fixed, you have a whole system 
functioning which allows us to do exactly what you and I are doing, namely to say new things, to understand 
new things, to interpret new expressions nobody has ever heard. Qualitatively speaking, that's what the 
system of moral judgment looks like. So it's conceivable that it has a similar kind of basis. But we have to 
find the answer. You can't just guess. You could say the same about ... </p>
<p><i>It can't be simple. It can't be &quot;Thou shalt not kill,&quot; obviously.</i> </p>
<p>No. Because that's not what we decide. We decide much more complex things. So what are they? We have 
good reason to believe that they're there because we can in fact make relatively consistent judgments, 
understood and appreciated by others, sometimes with disagreement, in which case you can have moral 
discourse. And it's under new conditions and facing new problems, and so on. Unless we're angels, it got 
into the organism the same way other complex things did, namely, largely by a genetically determined 
framework which gets marginally modified through the course of probably early experience. That's a moral 
system. How much variation can there be in such moral systems? Without understanding, we don't know. 
How much variation can there be in languages? Without understanding we don't know. </p>
<p><i>By variation, you mean from individual to individual?</i> </p>
<p>Or from culture to culture, and so on. We can make a fair guess that it's not much variation. The reason for 
that is quite elementary. The system appears to be complex and determinate, and there are only two factors 
that can enter into determining it. One is our fixed internal nature, and the other is experience. And we know 
that experience is very impoverished. It doesn't give a lot of direction. Suppose somebody asks, Why do 
children undergo puberty at a certain age? Actually, nobody knows the answer to that, so we're talking about 
a topic that's unknown. But there are only two factors that can enter into it. One is something in pre-puberty 
experience that sets you to undergo puberty, some effect of the environment, say, peer pressure, or somebody 
told you it would be a good idea, or something like that. The other is, you're just designed so that under 
certain conditions and at a certain level of maturation, hormones, this and that, you undergo puberty. 
Everybody assumes the second, without knowing anything. If somebody came along and said they think that 
it's peer pressure that causes puberty because you see other people doing it and you want to be like them, 
without knowing anything you just laugh. The reason you laugh is very simple. The environment is not 
specific enough and rich enough to determine this highly specific change that takes place. That logic holds 
for just about everything in growth and development. That's why people assume without knowledge that an 
embryo will become a chicken or a human depending on its nature, not depending on the nutrition that's fed 
in, though its needs the nutrition. The nutrition doesn't have enough information to cause those highly specific 
changes. And it looks as if things like moral judgment are of that character. </p>
<p><i>As are, you would say, rules of language, perhaps even concepts?</i> </p>
<p>Yeah. For rules of language and for concepts, there's a fair amount of understanding of the matter, especially 
rules of language. In fact, that's the area of human intelligence where there's most understanding. But almost 
everything has more or less the same logic. As I said, it's not different from the logic of embryological 
development. In fact, it's kind of similar to that. I think a reasonable judgment at this point would be that 
things like moral evaluation are similar. Actually contributing to this is the fact that you can have moral 
discourse. Take an issue on which people are really split. Take, say, slavery. If you look at the debate over 
slavery, to a certain extent it wasn't just an intellectual debate, obviously. It was a struggle. But insofar as it 
was an intellectual debate, and it was, partially, there was a certain shared moral ground to it. And in fact 
the slave owner's arguments are not so simple to answer. In fact some of them are valid and have a lot of 
implications, and they were taken seriously by American workers in the late nineteenth century. </p>
<p><i>You take better care of the slave if you own it than ...</i> </p>
<p>Exactly. You take better care of your car if you own it than if you rent it, so you take better care of your 
worker if you own it than if you rent it. So slavery is benevolent. And the free market is morally atrocious. 
Workers who organized into the Knights of Labor and other working-class organizations in the late 
nineteenth century, you look back at the literature and you see a strain running through that says, look, we 
fought to end slavery, not to impose it. </p>
<p><i>So somehow there are these moral principles or something that you understand that you have to appeal 
to even if what you're doing is rather venal.</i> </p>
<p>In fact, I think it's extremely rare for even an SS guard or a torturer or whatever to say, I'm doing this 
because I like to be a son of a bitch. Everybody does bad things in their lives, and if you think back, it's rare 
that you have said, I'm doing it because I feel like it. </p>
<p><i>You reinterpret the components of it so ...</i> </p>
<p>So it fits the moral values that you share with other people. I don't want to suggest that moral values are 
uniform; if you look across cultures you do find some differences. But when you look at different languages 
you also appear to find in fact radical differences. You know they can't be there. Because if the differences 
were really great, it would have been impossible to acquire any of the languages. So therefore they've got to 
be superficial, and the scientific question is, prove what must be true by the logic of the situation. I think the 
same things must be the case for moral judgment, too. Going back to your original point, we can't reasonably 
doubt that moral values are rooted in our nature, I don't think. </p>
<p><i>But if that's true, I've always had to think about it in such a way that for me the image of a human being 
is a creature with certain kinds of needs and desires and potentials and capabilities and that the 
fulfillment of those is social, that the fulfillment of those doesn't entail that one crush another, that one 
be on top of another, that one gain at another's loss and so on. If that's true, and if people have this 
shared set of values, then you have to explain why everything is as corrupt and hierarchical and 
war-laden as it is.</i> </p>
<p>First of all, why not ask another question: how come there is so much sympathy and care and love and 
solidarity? That's also true. </p>
<p><i>That's the reverse. That's the way I answer it all the time.</i> </p>
<p>There's no such thing as, Why is there so much of this and so much of that? There is what there is. What there 
is is doubtless conditioned by the opportunities and choices that are imposed and available in a particular 
social, cultural, and even physical setting. </p>
<p><i>Someone might say, just to clarify what all this means, to truck and barter is human.</i> </p>
<p>Someone can say it, but there's no reason to believe it. </p>
<p><i>Why isn't there any reason to believe it? The person's argument is, Look around. Trucking and bartering 
everywhere.</i> </p>
<p>And you look at peasant societies and they lived for thousands of years without it. Take a look inside a 
family. Do people truck and barter over how much they're going to eat for dinner? Certainly a family is a 
normal social structure. You can't exist without it. And you don't have trucking and bartering in it. If you look 
back at the history of trucking and bartering, say, look at the history of modern capitalism, here we know a 
lot about it. First of all, peasants had to be driven by force and violence into a labor system. They didn't 
want it. Then there were major conscious efforts made to create wants. There's a whole interesting literature 
about want creation. It happened over a long stretch in the evolution of capitalism, but you see it 
encapsulated briefly when slavery was terminated. It's dramatic to look at those cases. </p>
<p><i>You see it all the time on TV.</i> </p>
<p>Creating wants, yes. But I'm talking about conscious discussion of the need to do it. In the early 1830s there 
was a big slave revolt in Jamaica, which was one of the things that led the British to decide to give up 
slavery, that is, it was not paying any more. Within a couple of years they had to go from a slave economy to 
a so-called &quot;free&quot; economy. But they wanted it to remain exactly the same. They understood this. You take a 
look at the parliamentary debates. They're very conscious that they've got to keep it the way it is. The 
masters become the owners. The slaves become the happy workers. We've got to somehow work it out. </p>
<p><i>Distribution of wealth and power, keep it. Slave relation, dump it.</i> </p>
<p>Yes, they wanted everything to remain the same except not formal slavery, and the problem is, how do you 
do it? There's a lot of open land in Jamaica. If you let the slaves go free, they're just going to go out on the 
land and settle and be perfectly happy and they're not going to work for the sugar plantations. How are we 
going to force them to work on the plantation? Two things were decided. This was the period when 
everybody was talking about how marvelous free trade is, the government's not allowed to intervene and you 
can't help people in the Irish famine a decade away and that sort of thing. But in Jamaica it was a little 
different. There they said, we'll use government state force to close off the lands so people can't go to the 
land. And since all these workers don't really want a lot of things, they're just going to satisfy their needs, 
which they can easily do in this tropical climate, we have to create wants. We have to create a set of wants 
so that they desire things which they now don't desire. And the only way they'll be able to achieve those 
desires is by working as wage labor in order to get them. There was conscious discussion and in fact 
extensive efforts made to do exactly what you see on TV: create wants so that people would be driven into a 
wage labor society which they don't want themselves. That pattern is done over and over again through the 
history of capitalism. In fact, what the history of capitalism shows is that throughout people had to be driven 
into situations which are now claimed to be their nature. If the history shows anything, it's that that's not their 
nature. </p>
<p><i>But of course if you erase the history, erase the evidence, and look only at a snapshot of the present, it's 
a consistent hypothesis that maybe it is natural. It becomes a compelling legitimation.</i> </p>
<p>Sure. But again, by that argument, you could justify slavery. Take a snapshot of a slave society, and probably 
under most circumstances most of the slaves not only accept it but want it to stay that way. That's the only 
way they can survive. They look to the master to protect them. They don't want to give that up. Same about 
feudal societies. Same about absolutism. Probably the same about prisons, if you bother to look. </p>
<p><i>So what is it about the society we live under that is at the core of what's wrong? What's got to go?</i> </p>
<p>In my opinion, <i>every</i> form of authority and domination and hierarchy, every authoritarian structure has to 
justify itself. It has no prior justification. It has to prove that it's justified. </p>
<p><i>What kind of authoritarian structure?</i> </p>
<p>Anything. </p>
<p><i>Something where one person has more power than another.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah. Like you stop your three-year-old kid when he's trying to cross the street. That's an authoritarian 
situation. It's got to be justified. Okay, I think in that case you can give a justification for it. The burden of 
proof is on the person exercising the authority, invariably. Most of the time, when you look, these structures 
have no justification. They have no moral justification. They have no justification in the interests of the 
person lower in the hierarchy, or other people, or the environment, or the future, or the society, or anything 
else. They're there in order to preserve certain structures of power and domination that benefit those at the 
top. And every time you find that, it's illegitimate and it should change. And we find it everywhere. We find 
it in all kinds of human relations, crucially in economic relations, which are at the core of how any society 
functions. What's produced, what's consumed, what's distributed, what decision was made. These things help 
set a framework within which everything else happens. And they're completely hierarchic and authoritarian. </p>
<p><i>It's also true that how people live their lives in their homes, how people regard one another, sets a 
framework in which even work is affected. All these things mutually interact with each other and affect 
one another.</i> </p>
<p>And in every one of them that you look at, there are questions about authority and domination that ought to be 
raised constantly, and that very rarely have satisfactory answers. Sometimes they do, I think, but it has to be 
shown. As a matter of fact, you can even ask the same about your relation to animals. The questions can be 
asked there, too, in fact are being asked. </p>
<p><i>You're an animal rights activist?</i> </p>
<p>I think it's a serious question. To what extent do we have a right to torture animals? I think it's a very good 
thing that that question ... </p>
<p><i>Torture?</i> </p>
<p>Experiments are torturing animals, let's say. That's what they are. So to what extent do we have a right to 
torture animals for our own good? I think that's not a trivial question. </p>
<p><i>What about eating?</i> </p>
<p>Same question. </p>
<p><i>Are you a vegetarian?</i> </p>
<p>I'm not, but I think it's a serious question. If you want my guess, my guess would be that ... </p>
<p><i>A hundred years from now everyone will be.</i> </p>
<p>I don't know if it's a hundred years, but it seems to me if history continues--that's not at all obvious, that it 
will--but if society continues to develop without catastrophe on something like the course that you can sort of 
see over time, I wouldn't be in the least surprised if it moves toward vegetarianism and protection of animal 
rights. In fact, what we've seen over the years--and it's hard to be optimistic in the twentieth century, which 
is one of the worst centuries in human history in terms of atrocities and terror and so on--but still, over the 
years, including the twentieth century, there is a widening of the moral realm, bringing in broader and 
broader domains of individuals who are regarded as moral agents. </p>
<p><i>Nothing could be happening to that underlying, wired-in, inate, intrinsic character... That can't be 
changing.</i> </p>
<p>No, but it can get more and more realized. You can get a better and better understanding of it. We're 
self-conscious beings. We're not rocks. And we can get more and more understanding of our own nature, not 
because we read a book about it. The book doesn't have anything to tell you, because nobody knows 
anything. But just through experience, including historical experience, which is part of our own personal 
experience because it's embedded in our culture, which we enter into. </p>
<p><i>So then it's plausible that vegetarians, animal rights advocates and the like are just a couple of steps 
ahead in discerning something about ...</i> </p>
<p>It's possible. I think I'd certainly keep an open mind on that. You can understand how it could be true. It's 
certainly a pretty intelligible idea to us. I think one can see the moral force to it. You don't have to go back 
very far to find gratuitous torture of animals. In Cartesian philosophy, for example, where it was assumed ... 
the Cartesians thought they had proven that humans had minds and everything else in the world was a 
machine. So there's no difference between a cat and a watch, let's say. It's just the cat's a little more 
complicated. You go back to the court in the seventeenth century, and big smart guys who studied all that 
stuff and thought they understood it would as a sport take Lady So-and-So's favorite dog and kick it and beat 
it to death and so on and laugh, saying, this silly lady doesn't understand the latest philosophy, which was 
that it was just like dropping a rock on the floor. That's gratuitous torture of animals. It was regarded as if 
we would ask a question about the torturing of a rock. You can't do it. There's no way to torture a rock. The 
moral sphere has certainly changed in that respect. Gratuitous torture of animals is no longer considered 
quite legitimate. </p>
<p><i>Maybe what's changing is the understanding of what an animal is, rather than some of the underlying 
moral values.</i> </p>
<p>In that case it probably was, because in fact the Cartesian view was a departure from the traditional view, in 
which you didn't torture animals gratuitously. On the other hand, there are cultures like, say, fox hunting, 
aristocratic cultures that have fox hunting as a sport, or say, bear baiting, or things like that, in which there 
actually was gratuitous torture of animals. In fact, it's kind of intriguing to see how we regard this. Take cock 
fighting, in which cocks are trained to tear each other to shreds. Our culture happens to regard that as 
barbaric. On the other hand, we train humans to tear each other to shreds. It's called boxing matches. And 
that's not regarded as barbaric. So there are things we don't permit of cocks that we permit of poor people. 
There are some funny values at work there. </p>
<p><i>It's peculiar. But of course we don't pay the birds, whereas we pay the boxers handsomely. We assume 
that they suffer.</i> </p>
<p>But everybody knows that you don't find people going into professional boxing from wealthy families. That 
tells you something right away. </p>
<p><i>So if authority relations are the things that are suspect, the things that have to be undone, what are the 
institutions that basically embody that? Presumably private ownership.</i> </p>
<p>Private ownership's an obvious one. Patriarchic relations are another. Relations of race discrimination and 
oppression are others. </p>
<p><i>How about the market?</i> </p>
<p>The market itself, just by its very logic, induces oppressive relations very quickly, simply because of the 
inequities it produces. </p>
<p><i>That's where the justice or equity in some sense is the thing that's abrogated by authority, the thing that 
you want to justify.</i> </p>
<p>I think authority and justice are incompatible, except in very rare instances, namely, if the authority can be 
justified. And maybe sometimes it can. Like the case of caring for children. I think there it can be justified. 
Or suppose we had a catastrophe, let's say. Suppose a hurricane swept over this place and a couple of 
people who for some reason happened to have their heads screwed on sort of took control and told us, do 
this, do that, do the other thing. I'd follow them. I wouldn't know what to do. If they seemed to understand 
what has to be done, had presence of mind, some understanding of the situation, I think I would willingly 
grant them the authority to make decisions that I don't feel competent to make, and I'd rather have them make 
them. So I grant them the authority to do it. That's a situation of authority. But we agree to it. </p>
<p><i>Suppose somebody comes along and says that most working people in fact are granting the authority of 
their employers and bosses on the grounds that they don't have the expertise, the knowledge, the skills, 
etc., and they also don't want the burden and the responsibility?</i> </p>
<p>I would ask the same question that we would ask of prisoners. Suppose somebody said the prisoners are 
voluntarily granting the authority to the guards. I'd believe that when it's proven. The burden of proof, again, 
is always on the person who claims that the authority is justified. I think that's a fundamental moral principle. </p>
<p><i>Sure, but if you want to make a counterargument...</i> </p>
<p>It may not be that simple. In fact, it's not that simple. Let's make it realistic. The way things are now, and this 
has been true throughout modern history, people have chosen to go to jail because they can survive. If you're 
starving to death on the outside, freezing to death, there are many cases, and there are cases right now where 
they go out and break a window and say, hey, put me in jail. It looks like he's choosing to be kicked around 
by the warden. </p>
<p><i>Because it's better than another horrible situation.</i> </p>
<p>It's true in a sense. </p>
<p><i>It's also true that people choose to work for employers who will exploit them because there's no other 
option.</i> </p>
<p>You have to look at the range of options that are not only objectively available to them, but that are 
subjectively available. How are they allowed to think? How are they able to think? There are all kinds of 
ways of thinking that are kind of cut off from us, not because we're incapable of them, but there are various 
blockages that have been developed and imposed that keep us from thinking about them. Actually, that's what 
indoctrination is about. And I don't mean somebody giving you lectures. Sitcoms on television, sports that 
you watch. Every aspect of the culture involves some form of expression of what a proper life or a proper 
set of values are, implicitly. That's all indoctrination, and that cuts off opportunities. And often just straight 
violence. If people cannot find what their own values are except through interaction, what's called political 
theory, there's not much theory to it, it's truisms, but one of the traditional ideas of political theory for 
hundreds of years has been that in order to maintain absolute control--what we nowadays call totalitarian 
societies--what you have to do is isolate people. People have to be isolated in order to be controlled. And 
once they're isolated they're easily controlled because they don't even know what they think. You're sitting 
alone in a room and you don't even know what you think. Again, in science, it's a commonplace. You work 
together. There's no other way to work. In order to have ideas or understanding, you have to sort of bounce 
them off other people and see what their reactions are and learn from them. That's the way you even find out 
what your values are, or your interests, or anything else. Keep people isolated and they don't have subjective 
options, even if they have objective ones. And unless those options are opened up, both subjectively and in 
fact concretely, namely you can do something about it without suicide or suffering, then to claim that people 
choose their oppression is completely meaningless. They choose it under conditions where there isn't a 
choice. </p>
<p><i>Suppose somebody said that that kind of observation is taken from on high. Who are you to decide that 
what somebody else is choosing has been constrained? Who are you decide? Once you start doing that ...</i> </p>
<p>It's for them to decide. I agree. I think it's for the people to decide. But the point is the people should be 
given every opportunity to make a considered choice, meaning an opportunity to think through the options 
and so on. For example, I've just been reading a novel by an Egyptian novelist who won the Nobel Prize a 
couple of years ago about life in Cairo, I think it was in the 1920s. The central story is a woman who lives 
under the iron rule of her husband. She's a total slave. In a big tragedy, she gets kicked out for this or that 
infringement. Her life is destroyed because she loved being a slave. She was able to take care of the house, 
and she had her domain in which she was not out of the house, but that's ok, because the husband is the god, 
that sort of thing. You can imagine the rest. Did she choose that? I don't know if it's an accurate depiction of 
some society. But it could be. In fact, I'm sure it is of some societies. Did she choose it? In a sense, yes. Is it 
therefore her nature? In order to know the answer to that question, you have to put that same person in other 
circumstances. </p>
<p><i>People have a remarkable talent for making the best of whatever situation they're in, and that's obviously 
a tremendously advantageous quality. But it's also a quality that leaves you trapped in circumstances 
that are far less desirable than you might otherwise attain.</i> </p>
<p>That's the point of isolation--cut people off from thinking through and perceiving the opportunities that are 
available to them. Leave them only making do with things as they are. </p>
<p><i>So suppose we eliminate these obstacles to human beings being free and liberated and fulfilling 
themselves. What does that mean? What kind of a society is that? Clearly, there's been one label given to 
this--socialism--over the years.But nowadays people claim this failed, that something went wrong.</i> </p>
<p>First of all, I don't know that anything went wrong. We may not be ready for it. But there was a period in 
history when we weren't ready for ending slavery, either. There was a period in human history when 
conditions, including subjective conditions, were such that ending slavery wasn't in the cards. You could 
argue--I don't agree with it--one could argue that conditions are such that we need the degree of hierarchy 
and domination that exists in totalitarian institutions like capitalist enterprises in order to satisfy our needs, 
at least so far in history. </p>
<p><i>With central planning or dictatorship ...</i> </p>
<p>It could be argued. I don't believe a word of it. But the point is somebody would have to argue it. If you look 
at what actually happened, the concentration of force and violence was such as to guarantee certain 
outcomes. Those outcomes destroyed incipient efforts at cooperative worker control, say. There have been 
efforts in that direction for hundreds of years. They regularly get crushed. And they get crushed by force. The 
Bolsheviks are a perfectly good example. In the stages leading up to the Bolshevik revolution, up to October 
1917, there were incipient socialist institutions being developed--workers' councils, things like that. They 
survived to an extent, but not very long. They were pretty much eliminated. You can argue about the 
justification, but the fact is that they were pretty quickly eliminated. Some people want to justify it. The 
standard justification is, Lenin and Trotsky had to do it because of the contingencies of the civil war and 
survival and this and that. </p>
<p><i>There wouldn't have been food otherwise, says the apologis.</i> </p>
<p>Right. That's the only kind of justification that immoral acts can possibly get. That's the only kind of 
justification that authority can ever get. Look, we needed it. It's like my hurricane example. Under dire 
conditions you accept authority. </p>
<p><i>Actually, it's exactly analogous to the hurricane example.</i> </p>
<p>Exactly analogous. The question is, Is it true? There you've got to look at the historical facts. I don't think it's 
true. In fact, I think these structures were dismantled before the ... </p>
<p><i>Yes, they were. But does a Lenin or a Trotsky sincerely feel that they're like the couple of people who are 
running through the streets helping in the hurricane, or are they just aggrandizing their own wealth and 
power and status? Or it is the same thing?</i> </p>
<p>I think it's the same thing. We don't want to be cavalier about it. It's a question of historical fact and what the 
people really were like and what they were thinking, and you've got to find out what the answer is. But my 
feeling is, reading their own writings, that they knew what they were doing and it was understandable and 
they even had a theory behind it. It was both a moral theory and a socio-economic theory. First of all, as 
good orthodox Marxists, they didn't really believe that a socialist revolution was possible in Russia, which 
was just a peasant backwater. So they were carrying out a kind of holding action, waiting for the iron laws 
of history to grind out the revolution in Germany, where it's supposed to come. You know the story better 
than I do. That's what's supposed to happen by historical necessity, so they're going to hold on until it 
happens, and then Russia will be backwarder than it ought to be. Well, it didn't happen in Germany. They 
also thought that in this pre-capitalist society, Russia being a deeply impoverished Third World society, 
basically pre-capitalist, except for little pockets here and there, it was just necessary to beat the people into 
development. They had to be turned into what Trotsky called the &quot;labor army&quot; in order to carry out forced 
development, which would somehow carry them over the early stages of capitalism and industrialization to 
the point where then the iron laws of history would start to work because the master said they were going to. 
So there was a theory behind it, and a moral principle. It's going to be better for them in a while. </p>
<p><i>So these could be understandable and even honest mistakes, or they could be natural outgrowths of a 
worldview which says there are relatively few people who are exceptionally smart and should run the 
show.</i> </p>
<p>That was Bakunin's prediction, about half a century before, that this was exactly what was going to happen. 
He was talking about the Marxists at that time. That was before Lenin was born. His prediction was, the 
nature of the intelligentsia as a formation in modern industrial society is that they can become managers. 
They're not going to become managers because they own capital. They're not going to become managers 
because they've got a lot of guns. They're going to become managers because they can control and organize 
and direct what's called knowledge and so on. </p>
<p><i>Information and skills and access to decision-making.</i> </p>
<p>And he says they're going to become a Red bureaucracy, because that's in their interests. He didn't say that's 
the nature of people. I don't know how much he thought it through. But reading back, we shouldn't say they 
are going to do it because that's the nature of people. It's that the ones who don't do it will be cast by the 
wayside. The ones who do do it will make out. The ones who are worthless and brutal and harsh enough to 
do it, they're the ones who are going to survive in this kind of system. The ones who try to associate 
themselves with popular organizations and to help the people themselves become organized and to serve the 
people and that kind of thing are just not going to survive in these situations of power. </p>
<p><i>Supposing you have a relative advantage on information and knowledge. How do you explain that to 
yourself? It's not too dissimilar from having a great amount of wealth, material wealth. You either have 
that material wealth or knowledge by virtue of somehow being better or by virtue of somehow unjustly 
having more than you deserve. It's a lot easier to assume that it's because you're better.</i> </p>
<p>Why is it &quot;better&quot;? </p>
<p><i>You're in the lead.</i> </p>
<p>But all kinds of people are better at all kinds of things. There are things that I think I'm better at than the guy 
across the street. There are things that the guy across the street's better at than I am. Who's better? </p>
<p><i>You have a healthy view of the situation. There's an unhealthy view of the situation which says, The 
reason why I have three cars and a huge house, etc., is because I am a different kind of human being. I 
am superior. It's like racism, except it doesn't have skin color as its ...</i> </p>
<p>Everyone has some particular distribution of traits. You're better at some things and worse at others. This 
guy is a good violinist. This guy can't hear straight. This guy can fix mechanical things and understand them. 
The other one can't. If it wasn't true, I'd want to commit suicide. Living in a society of clones would be 
worse than death. If everybody was alike it's not like living at all. You should enjoy and appreciate the 
variety. The fact that other people can do things that I can't do is a source of appreciation. I don't feel bad if I 
can't play the violin like somebody else. If I can't solve physics problems like somebody else, fine. It makes 
me happy. You do what you do. Getting back to your point, the particular distribution of traits that I have, 
partly just by nature, partly by the advantages that I've had through life, which were plenty, in the case of the 
guy with three cars, there's a particular collection of traits plus luck. And the traits might be viciousness, 
aggressiveness, willingness to undercut others, and so on, whatever that collection of traits is, they're the 
ones that are valued and supported in particular social arrangements. So the Mafia don has traits which are 
rewarded under particular social situations. Hitler had traits which were rewarded under those social 
situations. That part's true, in that sense. It doesn't mean that they're better. It means that they're better adapted 
to getting ahead under particular conditions. </p>
<p><i>The person in that position can have your understanding of the situation or can have an understanding of 
the situation that it's just basically theft or can understand the situation as a proper reward for 
somebody who is a superior being.</i> </p>
<p>Usually people will pick the last one. </p>
<p><i>Right. That's my point. But once you pick the last one, if you're Lenin or Trotsky or whoever, then the 
understanding of society that you come up with tends to reflect that. So you come up with yourself as a 
central actor, even a savior. You think there's a hurricane coming and I have to save everybody from it, 
when in fact there is no hurricane coming, or, in any event, the only solution is for people to be saving 
themselves, not having their means to do so taken away by you. There was the possibility of real 
democracy and real participation instead. But you see a hurricane because the role of savior is the one 
you want to fill.</i> </p>
<p>And that's where I come back to what I said before. The burden of proof is always on the person who claims 
the right of authority. So if you see a hurricane coming, prove it. If you can convince me that there's a 
hurricane coming, and that you're the person who ought to direct people, okay, maybe so. But you've got to 
prove it. I don't have to disprove it. I don't have to disprove anything. I can just say, You haven't proven it. 
Period. And then I win. </p>
<p><i>And beating you over the head till you agree or holding all the cards and allowing no one to play unless 
they agree, is of course not proving it, it is coercing it...</i> </p>
<p>Yes, and so that's the sense in which the burden of proof is on those who claim the legitimacy of authority. 
And that's true whether it's a factory, a family or any other social arrangement. I think that that burden can 
very rarely be met. It seems to me that part of real education, if we ever allowed such a thing, would be to 
make sure people understand very early on that that's where the burden of proof is. I think you don't have to 
try to teach it to people, however. I think they know it. You have to keep it from being driven out of their 
heads. And it is driven out of their heads. It's driven out of their heads very early on just by the structure of 
the educational system. </p>
<p>Kids who are too independent quickly get into trouble and are kept in line. Again, we don't want to be glib 
about it. Again, the burden of proof is always on whoever it is that claims that the child has to be controlled. 
Maybe the child is being independent and should be encouraged. It's just personal experience. As a kid I 
happened to be lucky enough to be until I was about twelve in an experimental school run on Deweyite lines 
by Temple University which happened to be a very free and open and independent place where they 
encouraged independence and creativity and so on. It was very constructive. It was a shock to me when I got 
into City Academic High School for upward-striving kids who were going to go off to big colleges and 
discovered what authority really is like in educational structures. I never had that before. And it certainly 
requires justification, and I doubt that justification can be given in a great many cases. A lot of even the 
stupidity of education has a social function, namely, preventing independence. You're given some stupid 
assignment in eighth grade, and you'd better obey. </p>
<p><i>I've noticed that the public school system teaches not just obedience but also endurance of boredom, the 
ability to sit and watch the clock and not run out of the room, which of course is exactly the skill that one 
has to have to work in a capitalist firm.</i> </p>
<p>Punctuality. My oldest friend, who happened to emigrate from Eastern Europe when he was fifteen or so, 
once told me that he went to a school in New York for bright kids. One of the things that struck him right off 
in comparison with his earlier education was that if you got a C on an exam, nobody paid any attention. But 
if you came two minutes late, you had to go to the principal's office--meaning you're being trained for 
docility, obedience, punctuality for an assembly line job. </p>
<p><i>I remember even at MIT I was always astounded by the extent to which the education was faculty coming 
in and writing textbooks on the wall and never once talking about the creative aspect of what they do, or 
never literally doing it with you, but rather just reproducing stuff that you could go off and read in any 
event.</i> </p>
<p>It surprises me when you say that. </p>
<p><i>As a undergraduate.</i> </p>
<p>In graduate school it's just not like that at all. In fact, graduate school is kind of like an apprenticeship. 
You're working together. </p>
<p><i>Clearly that's the mode of education that makes some sense. The words are horrible: &quot;master&quot; and 
&quot;apprentice,&quot; but the reality is interesting...</i> </p>
<p>It's because you're learning a craft. Apprenticeship doesn't mean necessarily following orders. You can 
contribute and have your own ideas and learn at the same time. Doing science properly just isn't something 
you can teach. No one knows how to teach it. You just kind of get the idea somehow. It's like learning how to 
ride a bike or build a table. The way you get the idea is by working with people who somehow got the idea. 
You get something from them, and in science certainly you contribute to them. Everybody knows in the 
sciences that an awful lot of good ideas are coming from young people. That's just standard. </p>
<p><i>All your ideas come from students.</i> </p>
<p>It's just not even a question. You just take it for granted. </p>
<p><i>So you get the ideas from the students. Supposing we had a society with no authority, where's the drive? 
Where's the momentum? Where's the pressure to advance and grow? These are questions this discussion 
probably raises for some people.</i> </p>
<p>First of all, the &quot;pressure to advance,&quot; you have to ask exactly what that means. If you mean the pressure to 
produce more, who wants it? Is that necessarily the right thing to do? That's not obvious. In many areas it's 
probably the wrong thing to do. </p>
<p><i>Therefore the criticism that having this degree of freedom will remove that type of pressure isn't 
criticism at all. It's a compliment.</i> </p>
<p>Let's go back to the period when people had to be driven. It's still today. People have to be driven to have 
certain wants. Why? Why not leave them alone so they can just be happy and do other things? The only drive 
there is, ought to be internal. Take a look at kids. They're creative. They explore. They want to find out 
everything, try out new things. Why does a kid walk? </p>
<p><i>They have plenty of energy, curiosity, desire, but they don't want to work themselves to death.</i> </p>
<p>Why does a kid walk? Say you've got a kid who's a year old. He's crawling fine. He can get anywhere across 
the room he likes really fast, so fast his parents run after him to keep him from knocking everything down. 
All of a sudden he gets up and starts walking. He's terrible at walking. He walks one step and falls on his 
face. If he wants to really get somewhere he's going to crawl. So why does the kid start walking? To do new 
things. That's the way we're built. We're built to want to do new things, even if they're not efficient, even if 
they're harmful, even if you get hurt. I don't think that ever stops. You want to explore. You want to press 
your capacities to the limits. You want to appreciate what you can do. The joy of creation is something very 
few people have circumstances to experience much. Artists have it. Craftspeople have it. Scientists have it. 
Most people don't have the opportunity often, in our society. But if you've been lucky enough to have that 
opportunity, you know it's quite an experience. It doesn't have to be discovering Einstein's theory of 
relativity. </p>
<p><i>Your way of expressing it is so different from ... I remember--we won't use names--a physicist at MIT who 
gave a big talk and described the pleasure and the joy of creativity and wished that so many people, 99% 
of the population, who don't have the capacity to experience that and to enjoy that, could have that 
capacity. But since they don't I'll at least try to convey to them the pleasure that I get out of having a new 
idea.</i> </p>
<p>I think that the physicist didn't want to think. Whoever it was knows perfectly well that anyone can have that 
pleasure and that whoever it was had that pleasure many times in his life just by seeing what other people 
have done. </p>
<p><i>You can also have it at many different levels of ...</i> </p>
<p>When you read a proof and finally figure out what it's about, it's exciting. </p>
<p><i>And it could be Pythagorean's theorem ... tenth grade as well as quantum mechanics, or whatever ...</i> </p>
<p>That's exciting. My God, I never understood that before! That's creativity, even if somebody proved it 2,000 
years ago. Every physicist has gone through that plenty of times. You keep being struck by the marvels of 
what you're discovering, and you're discovering it, even though somebody else did it already. And if you can 
add little bits to that here and there, that's exciting. I don't have any reason to believe what that physicist said 
... And I think the same is true of a person who builds a boat. I don't see what's fundamentally any different. </p>
<p><i>It doesn't seem to be any different at all as far as creativity and pleasure of accomplishment, etc., unless 
of course an onus is put on it.</i> </p>
<p>I wish I could do that. I can't. I can't imagine doing it. </p>
<p><i>But there's one sense in which it's different. That is there's a social difference between those kinds of acts 
that can accrue power and the kinds that won't. The skills of building a boat are different than the skills 
of, say, conducting a meeting. Or for that matter being compelling verbally is very different than, say, 
running quickly, at least in most societies.</i> </p>
<p>But the skills to which rewards and power accrue are violence ... </p>
<p><i>I don't mean necessarily in a bad society, I mean even in a good society. In a good society the person who 
can make an argument and express herself well is going to be more influential if that isn't equalized 
somehow. It's relatively equalized. The person who runs fast but has no verbal abilities whatsoever, 
how's the person ...?</i> </p>
<p>I don't think it's true. I've been in situations, and I'm sure you have, when I knew I was presenting the right 
argument, but I couldn't convince anybody. Because they decided to do something else. It happens all the 
time. It happens in personal life, in family arguments, social situations, and so on. Unless the person 
who--maybe some Martian watching this can say, Jones won the argument. But unless Jones has the power to 
implement it, it doesn't make any difference. </p>
<p><i>If you're working with a group or you're in some kind of organization or whatever, a business, whatever 
it might happen to be, and suppose there is a degree of equity and fairness, at least formal, with regard 
to decision-making, and you all sit around and make decisions, and one or two people have knowledge of 
how the whole operation works and have at their fingertips a whole lot of information and facts about 
what's going on and also are very verbal, and some of the other people have productive skills and 
various other skills that are associated with the business, but don't have that information at their 
disposal, there isn't any doubt in my mind who's going to win nine times out of ten.</i> </p>
<p>Win what? </p>
<p><i>Policy decisions.</i> </p>
<p>The policy decisions. And who will win the decisions about how it's actually implemented? The people 
with the productive skills. </p>
<p><i>No. Not necessarily at all.</i> </p>
<p>Why not? They're the ones who are going to do it. In a society with equity. We were assuming a society with 
equity. Nobody has any power. They just have different capacities. </p>
<p><i>One person, one vote.</i> </p>
<p>All right, the person who makes the more convincing argument, assuming rationality, should convince the 
others. But then the person who implements the decisions will do it his or her way. </p>
<p><i>Clearly the situation will be much better if everybody comes to a decision with a degree of confidence 
and skills and so on that's commensurate to participating.</i> </p>
<p>That's what it means by being convinced. If you are convinced that this is the right thing to do, it doesn't make 
any difference whether somebody else had the idea or you had the idea. You're equally convinced. If you're 
not convinced, something went wrong. Then it was a situation of power and not a matter of greater capacity 
to work things out. </p>
<p><i>Take a Yugoslav firm in the market system. The workers appoint a manager. The manager makes a whole 
array of decisions that are the same as a manager would make in the Ford Motor Company. The workers 
in fact agree that the manager's decisions make sense and should be implemented. They can't make the 
decisions themselves, necessarily, because they don't have access to the facts. Still the situation is pretty 
disgusting.</i> </p>
<p>There's a situation where there's a difference of power, and the power translates into access to ... </p>
<p><i>What if the formal power rests with the workers?</i> </p>
<p>There's already a presupposition: the manager had more information and the manager got that because the 
manager had more power. Otherwise the manager wouldn't have had more information. </p>
<p><i>The manager's job is to oversee all this information and put the stuff together.</i> </p>
<p>But if you divide jobs up that way you're imposing relations of power. </p>
<p><i>Exactly. That's what I'm getting at.</i> </p>
<p>But if we extract the power from the situation it won't be true. If everyone has the same access to 
information, it still may turn out that the guy who happens to be the manager comes up with the best idea and 
everybody says, Yeah, that's the best idea. Okay, fine. That's not a problem. We know that it's not going to 
happen consistently. There's one area of human life that I know of which kind of approximates an equitable 
situation. It isn't really equitable, but it approximates one. That's a scientific laboratory, a scientific 
enterprise, where you have a senior professor who won a Nobel Prize and you have an undergraduate 
assistant, a lab technician and so on. If it's really working well, there's a lot of cooperation. And you see it. It 
is not the case that the person with the more publications comes up with all the answers, by no means. If 
they're really working together and trying to achieve something ... </p>
<p><i>Then it's a collective, or something. If you don't have structurally imposed differences in decision making 
power or in access to information needed for developing agendas and positions, fine.</i> </p>
<p>It may be that the guy with the Nobel Prize will often come up with a good idea. Maybe not. In fact, in these 
situations it typically isn't the case. It's often the graduate student. </p>
<p><i>After they've got a Nobel Prize they're already too old.</i> </p>
<p>Probably. Or they're too stuck in their ways. But the senior professor often has a contribution to make that's 
unique: experience, remembering something that somebody did four years ago that nobody else ever heard 
of. There are all kinds of ways in which people contribute to collective decisions. I don't see any reason to 
believe that, say, a decision in a factory is so infinitely more complex than working on an advanced 
scientific problem that you can expect one person to always have the right ideas. That's not going to happen. 
If it happens, it's because of power differences. </p>
<p><i>An imbalance</i> in access to decision making or information or skills critical to it... </p>
<p>And then we're back to where we were: eliminate the power differences, or strive to eliminate them. </p>
<p><i>Let me switch gears a minute. Back to the question of animal rights, the broadening understanding of 
human values and all that. How do you react to the debate around abortion?</i> </p>
<p>I think it's a hard one. I don't think the answers are simple. It's a case where there really are conflicting 
values. Most human situations, the kinds of things we're in all the time, it's very rare that there's a clear and 
simple answer. Sometimes the answers are very murky because we have different values and they just 
conflict. At least our understanding of our own moral values is not like an axiomatic system, where there's an 
answer and not some other answer. There are what appear to be conflicting values which give different 
answers. Maybe because we don't understand them well enough, or maybe they really are in conflict. In this 
case they're straight conflicts. From one point of view, a child up to a point is an organ of the mother's body. 
The mother ought to have the decision what to do. And that's true. From another point of view, the organism 
is a potential human being, and it has rights. And those two things are in conflict. One biologist I know once 
pointed out that you could say the same thing about women washing their hands. If a woman washes her 
hands, lots of cells flake off, and in principle those cells have the genetic instructions for a human being. You 
can imagine a future technology which would take one of them and create a human being from it. He was 
making it as a reductio ad absurdum argument, but because there's an element of truth to it, an element so tiny 
that it makes it a reductio ad absurdum argument, but it's not like saying something about astrology. What he's 
saying is true. </p>
<p><i>There's a related argument I've found tough to deal with. Suppose you have a person who is a surgeon 
who is so skilled she is the only one who can deal with this particular kind of ailment. There's a sudden 
outbreak of the ailment. It only takes five minutes for the person to do what they do, but only they can do 
it. So you could literally have an assembly line because there are so many people struck with this 
ailment, an assembly line of people flowing past this person. So if this person goes to the bathroom or 
goes to eat a meal or goes to do anything, more people are going to die that would have been saved had 
she not done that. What's this person supposed to do?</i> </p>
<p>It's like triage. A person is going to have to make an impossible choice among alternatives. It's easy to 
construct situations like that. That's what they do in philosophy seminars all the time. We don't agree with 
torture. There was an article in <i>Newsweek</i> by a philosopher whose hidden agenda was that you shouldn't 
criticize Israel for torturing Arabs. The argument was like an elementary philosophy seminar. People say 
torture is bad. But is it really bad? Suppose there was a doomsday machine that was about to go off and 
blow up the universe. There was one person who knew how to stop it, but he wasn't telling us how to stop it. 
The only way you would get it out of him was by torturing him. Under those circumstances would torture be 
okay? You say, Okay, under those circumstances. Then, Aha! You're not opposed to torture. Let's move it a 
little bit over. You get into what's called a &quot;slippery slope argument.&quot; You can play this game all the time. 
You can make up situations in which usually conflicting values lead to what would ordinarily be ridiculous 
conclusions under other circumstances. And the trouble is, life often poses such circumstances. You don't 
have to make them up. The abortion issue is one where life is posing those choices. </p>
<p><i>You think that the choice there isn't that it is or isn't a person. You just basically have to admit that it's a 
potential person, it's an actual organ in a sense.</i> </p>
<p>We don't have have a clear conception of what a person is. I think a reasonable proposal is that it changes 
from an organ to a person when it's viable. But that's arguable and it's not very clear when it is. That's why 
this biologist pointed out it could be when the woman was washing her hands, depending on the state of 
technology. But that's life. You're faced with hard decisions of conflicting values. </p>
<p><i>Changing gear again: Take the last thirty years, say, from the New Left to the present, and look at it as a 
span of political activism in the U.S. Leftists seem to do this, as far as I can tell, very infrequently. Try 
and basically say, What lessons are there in that? Is whatever we achieved the most we could have 
achieved? Did the people who were acting, were they doing basically about as well as one could expect, 
or were there horrible failures? Was there some impediment that was being overlooked, some obstacle to 
having greater success that we just didn't think of and we didn't deal with, and had we dealt with that we 
would have done better? In other words, how do you view the period? Certainly people of my generation, 
a great many of them, right now are very frustrated. They're feeling like, Thirty years ago I made this 
choice. It's thirty years later and it hasn't gone where I thought it was going to go.</i> </p>
<p>I think, first of all, where they thought it was going to go was pretty unrealistic. I think if you look at what's 
happened in thirty years, it's a lot better than it was. A lot of this stuff got started during the Vietnam War. At 
the ideological level, all of us who were opposed to the war lost flat out within the mainstream institutions. 
The question now is, have the Vietnamese done enough to compensate us for the crimes that they committed 
against us? In the newspapers or the journals or the books that's the only question you're allowed to discuss. 
If you want to be part of the educated culture, the elite culture, the only question you can pose. I actually have 
been through a lot of the newspapers on this, out of curiosity. Also the POW issue. George Bush gets up and 
says, The Vietnamese should understand that we bear them no permanent grudge. We're not going to make 
them pay for everything they did to us. If they finally come clean and devote their entire lives and every last 
resource they have to searching for the remains of one of those people they viciously blew out of the sky, 
then maybe we'll allow them entry into the civilized world. And there won't be one editorial writer or 
columnist who will either fall on the floor laughing or else say, this guy's worse than the Nazis. Because 
that's the way they all are. The only issue is, Will we forgive them for the crimes they committed against us? 
So at that level, we just lost the whole discussion. On the other hand, let's go to the general population. To 
this day, after twenty-five years of this endless, unremitting propaganda, to which no response is ever 
tolerated, 70% of the population disagrees with the elite culture. That tells you there's a victory at this level. 
If 70% of the population, after all this brainwashing, still says, as late as 1990, the war was fundamentally 
wrong and immoral, not a mistake, something got through. </p>
<p><i>Absolutely. And it tells us that for a period of six, seven years, however many years, the activism that 
people engaged in had a tremendous and long-lasting effect. But it doesn't answer people's concern that 
after thirty years the size of our organizations, the degree of organized dissent, the ability to amass new 
movements when new crises arise, or even, much more important, the ability to have sustained 
movements which are striking at ongoing institutional structures, on these axes there doesn't seem to be 
...</i> </p>
<p>I think that's an inaccurate reading of history. In fact, I think the opposite is the case. The last big such crisis 
was the Gulf War. I just disagree with a lot of my friends on that one, including most activists on the left. 
They regarded what happened as a catastrophe for the left, and as a proof of what you just said. I regard it as 
the opposite. This is the first time in history that I know of that big demonstrations started before a war. Take 
a look at the Vietnam War. After all, Kennedy started bombing South Vietnam in 1961-62. It was years 
before there was significant opposition. </p>
<p><i>That was my impression, too. I was incredulous at the speed at which the movement was able to make 
itself felt, visibly, around the Gulf...</i> </p>
<p>It was unbelievable. The thing that we should remember is, people in power know it. They might not want us 
to know it, but they know it. It's even clear from their own documents, as well as from what they do. The day 
the ground combat started in the Gulf War a very important document leaked. It was sort of buried in the 
papers, and most people missed it. It was the last paragraph of an article on something else. They leaked an 
early Bush administration planning document on Third World intervention. What it said was--and it still 
holds--that in the case of confrontations with much weaker enemies--meaning anyone we're willing to 
fight--we must not only defeat them but we must defeat them decisively and rapidly because anything else 
will undercut political support. That's a tremendous victory for the left. These guys understand that they don't 
have the option of carrying out intervention unless they carry out decisive, rapid victories over totally 
defenseless enemies before anyone notices, after having first demonized them. </p>
<p><i>I agree with you completely about the speed and scale of the response. And yet, it is the case that you 
describe having to argue with most of your friends. I encountered the same situation. It's a remarkable 
fact that we don't seem to be able to perceive, as a movement or as a body of people, our own effectivity.</i> </p>
<p>Of course nobody wants you to see it. In order to perceive it, it's as if you lived in a world where everybody 
told you--television, radio, books, everything else--that the world is flat. It's Winston Smith in <i>1984</i>. He's 
trying to hold on to the truth that two plus two equals four. Everybody says two plus two equals five. He 
remembers inside that two plus two equals four. It's hard to hold on to that truth. Especially when you're 
isolated. </p>
<p><i>So what's the trick?</i> </p>
<p>The trick is not to be isolated. If you're isolated, like Winston Smith, you're sooner or later going to break, as 
he finally broke. That was the point of Orwell's story. That's the whole tradition of totalitarianism: keep 
people isolated and you can get them to believe anything. The genius of American democracy has been to 
tolerate the formal freedoms that have been won through popular struggle but to eliminate any substance from 
them by just isolating people. And people are isolated. They're stuck in front of the tube. There are no 
associations. That's part of the fervor behind getting rid of unions. They're one of the natural means--not the 
only one--by which ordinary people come together. So you've got to destroy them. That's one of the reasons 
why it's very important that we have no real political parties, because people could get together and do stuff. </p>
<p><i>But what it says is that a left which creates a culture and which creates the possibility of actually 
working together, being friends, communicating with one another will be much less susceptible to this 
coercion. When I consider now versus thirty years ago, I have this feeling that's there a fundamental 
change, as atomized as it was then, it's much more so now. People just don't have friends. Nobody has 
people who they trust, who they're friends with, who they interact with on a regular, ongoing basis. Not 
nobody, but there's much less of that there was then.</i> </p>
<p>I'm not so sure there's less of it. I suspect that there's probably more of it, but it's in different circles. So for 
example, take the big movements of the last ... </p>
<p><i>I'm not talking about movements. I'm talking about just normal, everyday life. My parents, my friends, all 
the people I know.</i> </p>
<p>So what about the people in Witness for Peace, for example? They're mostly church-based, and their friends 
and associations are usually through churches, often even fundamentalist churches. But they have real friends 
and associations and work together. </p>
<p><i>That's one of those institutions ...</i> </p>
<p>But these things bring in huge numbers of people. That's why I say I think it's shifted. In fact, it's shifted 
towards different sectors of the population. In fact, they've become a lot more mainstream. During the sixties, 
it was kind of kids at universities who were the ones who had these associations and the political activism 
to a significant extent. There was a lot of that. Not everything, of course, but that was quite a bit of it. It's 
true, there things have in fact declined. But other parts of society have increased and are deepened. </p>
<p><i>The left has never offered it per se. The CP did, once upon a time. But the modern left, from the new left 
to now, has offered rallies and demonstrations. It's offered teach-ins. It's offered talks. But it's never 
offered ...</i> </p>
<p>What do you call the ... what do you think the right name is for these church-based Central America 
solidarity groups? Are they &quot;left&quot;? I would call it left. </p>
<p><i>They are setting a better model, perhaps, than anything that the left has had to offer.</i> </p>
<p>I don't think they're all that separate. A lot of people in them are people who came through sixties 
experiences, which affected everything. They affected the whole culture very broadly. The reason that so 
many things grow out of the churches is that that's the one kind of organic institution that hasn't been 
destroyed. They don't come out of labor unions in the country because we don't have unions. If I give a talk in 
Europe, up till pretty recently, even now, it could often be in a union hall. Not necessarily labor people, but 
just community people. I can't remember ever having done that in the U.S. It's usually a church. That exists. 
That's the one institution that hasn't been destroyed. So that's where things, all the movement offices are in 
the basement of some church. They're around. </p>
<p><i>That's always been true.</i> </p>
<p>Because that's the only thing that's around. But out of that have come other things, people who would not 
regard themselves ... they never read a Marxist-Leninist book in their lives and they don't care. Maybe their 
background is liberation theology. I think that's part of our movement, at least I've always regarded it that 
way. And the same with people who are involved in all sorts of other issues. </p>
<p><i>To what extent would you consider yourself somehow part of the same movement as Marxist-Leninists?</i> </p>
<p>There are personal friendships and contacts, but I don't really feel much empathy with it. For one thing I don't 
understand a lot of it. What I do understand I usually don't like. I don't want to say that I haven't learned 
anything from them or that I don't hold personal relations; in fact I do support all of the groups and will 
continue to as long as they do things I like. But I do feel a certain closeness ... the beliefs of the church-based 
groups are just incomprehensible to me, but I do feel a certain empathy with them that I don't feel with what 
are called official left groups. </p>
<p><i>You'd rather have them at your side, in some sense.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah. Like when I went down to Nicaragua and I lived in the Jesuit house. I was wondering, What the heck 
am I doing here? But that's where I felt at home. </p>
<p><i>They were ethical</i>. </p>
<p>Some sort of shared values. For me personally it was sort of weird, because just out of personal experience, 
aside from having nothing to do with organized religion or anything, I happened to grow up in an area in 
Philadelphia which was Irish and German Catholic, mostly. We were the only Jewish family around. I grew 
up with a visceral fear of Catholics. They're the people who beat you up on your way to school. So I knew 
when they came out of that building down the street, which was the Jesuit school, they were raving 
anti-Semites. So childhood memories took a long time to overcome. </p>
<p><i>As long as we're switching over, we have the church as an institution being a possible place where people 
can talk, develop ideas, develop agendas. But what about the church as an impediment to social change?</i> </p>
<p>That's what it's been through most of its history. What was remarkable in the last thirty, forty, fifty years is a 
radical change in the church, the Catholic Church, and which also showed up in many of the Protestant 
churches. There was a big change. The reason why the U.S. launched this terrorist war in Central America 
was to destroy this. People now talk as if the big enemy is Islamic fundamentalism. But they're forgetting 
something. For the last ten years the big enemy has been the Catholic Church, more of an enemy than Islamic 
fundamentalism. They had to destroy it. When Americas Watch did their wrap-up study on the 1980s, they 
pointed out that it was a decade framed by the murder of the Archbishop in 1980 and the murder of six Jesuit 
intellectuals in 1989. That wasn't accidental. The main target of attack was the church, because it had 
become a part, not entirely, but part of it had become a church devoted to liberation, to the poor. Sectors of 
the church did undertake what they called the preferential option for the poor, and very consciously. They 
recognized that for hundreds of years it had been the church of the rich and the oppressors, who were telling 
the poor, This is your fate. Accept it. A critically important sector of the church changed, important enough 
to include the dominant elements among the Latin American bishops, which set off the atrocities over the last 
ten years, in which the U.S. has vigorously participated. </p>
<p><i>The change is just an accident of history?</i> </p>
<p>I don't know enough about the internal dynamics of it to explain it. </p>
<p><i>What do you think religion is?</i> </p>
<p>Obviously, it means something to people, a lot. It doesn't to me. I don't understand it. I sort of understand it, 
but I can't empathize with it. To me it's just another set of irrational beliefs. You can believe this, you can 
believe that if you want. I don't understand why people should need irrational beliefs. Apparently many 
people seem to find a good deal of fulfillment in it. </p>
<p><i>Including lots of scientists. I was quite struck by that recently, finding all these physicists, chemists, 
biologists ...</i> </p>
<p>Honestly, I'm pretty skeptical when I read that stuff. </p>
<p><i>Some of those interviews are astounding.</i> </p>
<p>I remember once a close associate of Einstein's once told me, as a sort of a semi-joke, Einstein was always 
saying famous things ... </p>
<p><i>He always talks about God.</i> </p>
<p>She told me that when he says God he means &quot;I.&quot; &quot;God doesn't play dice with the cosmos&quot; means &quot;I don't 
believe in this stuff.&quot; When scientists talk about God and this, it reminds me a little bit of when Robert 
Oppenheimer used to talk about Persian poetry. One of the ways in which scientists try to look like, well, ... 
if they're not really civilized beings, the way they try to look like civilized beings is by doing things that they 
think are deep. Like you read Persian poetry or you think about Buddha or something like that. But that's 
always struck me as something of an affectation. It's striking that this kind of talk about God was not true of 
the generation of scientists, say, from Boer, Planck, Max Born and Einstein, the great period of modern 
science. It wasn't true. And there was a level of culture and civilization there that was real, that was not 
duplicated in twentieth-century America. I think this is true of a lot of things. For example, I don't think 
people of that generation would have named their particles &quot;quarks,&quot; trying to show how smart they are 
because they read <i>Finnegan's Wake</i>. They didn't have to show anybody how smart they were. They were 
smart and cultivated and educated. You didn't have to make everybody remember, He read <i>Finnegan's 
Wake</i>. </p>
<p><i>Murray Gell Mann is quite smart.</i> </p>
<p>&quot;Smart&quot; and &quot;cultivated&quot; are not the same thing. And it's not a matter of persons. It's a matter of the whole 
intellectual culture. The intellectual culture of Central Europe. </p>
<p><i>It's also what's supported and what's not.</i> </p>
<p>The intellectual culture of Central Europe out of which a lot of this grew was qualitatively different from that 
of twentieth-century America. </p>
<p><i>I recently read a book by a guy named Steven Weinberg, who's a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, very, 
very brilliant. And it is quite fascinating. The book not only makes difficult ideas accessible, but it's 
written in a very straight-forward way with no pretense. It feels wise, almost elegant in some sense.</i> </p>
<p>I knew him when he was at MIT, and I felt that. </p>
<p><i>A lot of these guys can write that way, which you don't find coming out of the soft sciences. You won't find 
an economist writing a book about economics like that.</i> </p>
<p>That's true. First of all, there's not much to say. But it's certainly true. On the other hand, you were talking 
about the novel ... this turning to divinity, and does the Big Bang tell us something about the creator. I think 
it's fairly recent in science. It's a pretty common thing. A lot of people write popular books about science 
now. They think you have to say that. And they didn't think they to say it forty years ago. And that's a cultural 
change. </p>
<p><i>It is a kind of different dimension, when you're talking forty, fifty years ago and you're talking about 
particles in the lab. Now they're talking about one-trillionth of a second after the whatever it was at the 
beginning.</i> </p>
<p>I don't think in terms of a conceptual revolution it's anything like the early quantum theory. </p>
<p><i>No, it's not</i>. </p>
<p>OK, so why didn't they say it? I think it's because they came from a different intellectual culture, where you 
didn't have to show that you were capable of dealing with the so-called &quot;big ideas,&quot; because you were. </p>
<p><i>That's America.</i> </p>
<p>Yeah, I think that's twentieth-century America, a technological civilization. </p>
<p><i>It's remarkable how religious this country is.</i> </p>
<p>It's unbelievable. It's not just that it's religious ... if you look at the comparative studies, there's a lot of 
comparative studies of religious beliefs. The U.S. is off the chart. It's like a devastated peasant society. </p>
<p><i>If you watch TV and watch sports events where they interview people after they've done an event, 
regarding China you hear jokes about how they used to say, I read Mao and he helped me jump and 
taught me how to do this high jump and I won the Olympic event. But that's also the way the Americans 
sound. Except it's God. The first thing out of their mouth is always, I thank God.</i> </p>
<p>It's shocking, just looking at the studies, which are interesting. I was just looking at one by Andrew Greeley 
which was a cross-cultural study. It turns out that 75% of Americans literally believe in religious miracles, 
for example. You can't find that anywhere else. </p>
<p><i>But what does that mean? Deeper, what does it mean if you go up to somebody on the street and they say, 
I'm one of those 75%? What does that mean?</i> </p>
<p>Either it means that they think they have to say it or they literally believe it. Either way it's the same. It shows 
that there are features of the society which are off the chart with regard to industrial societies. I have a 
feeling that it may be related to the sense ... there are other things which are striking, too. There is an 
increasing sense that nothing is responsive to me. The institutions don't work for me at all. In fact, that figure 
goes higher and higher every year. It's now hitting over two-thirds of the population, which is astonishing. 
83% of the population thinks that the entire economic system is inherently unfair. </p>
<p><i>But the two together ... think that the economic system is unfair, they also think that there's nothing that 
they can do about it.</i> </p>
<p>That's why I think they're connected. </p>
<p><i>Religion is the ...</i> </p>
<p>That's why I say it's like a devastated peasant society. In a society where people feel, I can't do anything, you 
turn to something supernatural. It's happening in Central America right now. The evangelical churches 
coming down with the story, Don't worry about this miserable existence. It doesn't matter anyway. Things 
will be better later. They're gaining considerable success in the wake of murderous destruction of social 
reform movements. </p>
<p><i>There's an element which makes sense. If you live under those conditions, then they're not likely to 
change unless you're trying to eke out the best possible existence you can, this kind of thing.</i> </p>
<p>Maybe. These are phenomena that have been looked at for a long time. Walter Dean Vernon was one of the 
social scientists who looked at it about ten, twelve years ago. He wrote about back to the nineteenth century 
there seemed to be a correlation between the lack of, say, worker organization and other popular 
organization in the U.S. and the lack of political differentiation and political ideal and so on on the one hand 
and the surprising degree of religious commitment on the other. It's possible that they're correlated. If you go 
back, there are other things to look at. The cheriastic elements in the church, millennial movements in the 
church, we're on the verge, the Messiah is coming, or wait till the Messiah, that kind of businesses, did 
regularly arise and was often even stimulated at times of social struggle or the collapse of social struggle. </p>
<p><i>That's oppression.</i> </p>
<p>That kind of thing. A.P. Thompson writes about that in <i>The Making of the English Working Class</i> at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century. It goes right through the nineteenth century in the U.S. Actually, business 
even supported evangelical preachers to try to ... in fact, you see it right now in the Islamic world. Take 
these 415 people who were kicked out of Israel from Hamas. Israel had supported the Islamic fundamentalist 
movement openly, as a counterweight to secular nationalism, which is what really bothered them. They were 
afraid of secular nationalism which would make accommodations, proposals, they would have to deal with 
these issues politically, which they didn't want to do. It got to the point where they were literally shipping 
Islamic fundamentalist young people to break up strikes by secular nationalist students on the West Bank. 
Well, they got what they wanted. Islamic fundamentalists. And it's happening throughout the Arab world, the 
rise of Islamic fundamentalism, which people talk about as this horrible thing which is very perplexing. Part 
of it is a reaction to the failure of secular nationalism. That failure has a number of reasons, one of them 
being Western hostility to it. Sure, you take away people's hopes and they'll turn to something else. </p>
<p><i>Next time we get together, perhaps we should start there, trying to work through what there is to be 
hopeful about, what, in more detail, is the goal we are striving for, what, in more detail, are the 
structures standing between us and that goal, and even, in more detail, what kind of activism and 
organization on our part might overcome those obstacles and attain the sought goals. But, for now, 
Thank you.</i> </p>

Parecon and Responses </i></font></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>In this final lecture I would like to present some of the
    debate that has taken place around the participatory economic
    model. To do this I include an essay Robin Hahnel and I wrote
    in answer to some economist critics. It summarizes a variety
    of weaknesses attributed to parecon, and answers them as best
    we are able to. First, however, we need to briefly address
    the questions raised last chapter. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Answers to Lecture 9 Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What are some goals you would like to see attained by
            a revolutionized kinship sphere. What implications would
            this have for an economy, and is parecon compatible? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>First, how would one approach this question in a
    disciplined fashion? Well, I don't think it is different in
    method from what we have tried to do in the prior lectures.
    One needs to decide basic aims for kinship. Then one needs to
    figure out basic concepts, first what is the kinship sphere,
    then what are its component institutional functions. Next, we
    might evaluate existing models and proposals for kinship
    structures using our values. Ultimately, we have to try to conceive
    new institutions (or choose among existing ones that we like)
    and construct a model for the sphere out of favored options. </p>
    <p>When I think about this, it seems to me that Kinship
    institutions should impose no distinctions on men and women, or
    adults and children, or people of different sexual preference
    that are (a) biologically unnecessary, and (b) contrary to
    full development and fulfillment of all these actors. There
    should be no opposed interests for the groups, or any other
    groups. When I think about kinship roles, I happen to conclude
    that attaining these aims requires, ultimately, an end to the
    nuclear family, an end, in fact, to the whole idea of gender
    defined asymmetrical mothering and fathering&#151;as compared
    to gender neutral parenting. That said, however, one can conceive
    many ways, I think, that people might court, procreate,
    socialize, etc., all consistent with desirable social values
    and outcomes. </p>
    <p>I think the implications, in both directions, are in
    general easy to describe. Each sphere of social life has to
    have no implications for actors that are contrary to basic
    operations in any other sphere. So, the economy cannot demarcate
    among men and women, or any other constituencies, in ways
    that would make kinship institutions inoperable. This would
    certainly happen if the economy enriched men and impoverished
    women, for example. </p>
    <p>In the same way, however, the kinship sphere, and thus
    socialization institutions, etc., have to provide people with
    habits, beliefs, skills, knowledge, and personalities suited
    to participation in a parecon. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are some goals you would like to see attained by
            a revolutionized cultural sphere. What implications would
            this have for an economy, and is parecon compatible? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Following the usual procedure, I find myself favoring
    something I call intercommunalism. The idea is simple enough.
    There is no right culture. The notion that everyone should
    have a correct culture is a cultural nightmare (though
    typically it is the view of many marxists). Instead, there
    ought to be many cultures, which is to say, many cultural
    communities. These may be defined in many ways, including religion,
    geography, various types of taste and preference and belief,
    or whatever. Intercommunalism is a situation in which every
    cultural community is free to pursue its beliefs and customs
    and celebrations, etc., as it likes, and is provided by right
    the space and means to do so, and is protected by right in
    any dispute with any larger cultural community. The large
    gives way, that is, to the small...an intellectually trivial but
    profoundly important practical requirement, I think. </p>
    <p>The economy will, to be compatible, have to treat all
    people identically, whatever their cultural allegiances. More,
    it will have to welcome cultural community caucuses to ensure
    that the culture of workplaces, etc., is not oppressive to
    minority groups. There is nothing in parecon that I can see
    that would disrupt intercommunalism, and much that would
    augment and foster it. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What are some goals you would like to see attained by
            a revolutionized political sphere. What implications would
            this have for an economy, and is parecon compatible? </li>
        <li>Finally, what implications do you think having a
            parecon has for accompanying kinship, cultural, or
            political spheres? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Why Participatory Planning?</h2>
    <p>In the shadow of Soviet turmoil, and very far from the
    public eye, a debate over what is a <i>desirable </i>economy
    has rekindled among those who believe people deserve more
    than capitalism. In the past five years a small torrent of books
    and articles have appeared. <i>Science and Society</i> and
    the <i>Review of Radical Political Economics</i> have both published
    special issues on the debate, <i>Z Magazine</i> has published
    a symposium, Pen-L (a progressive economists' Internet Forum)
    has facilitated spontaneous interchanges by modem, and
    periodic conferences of academics and activists have hosted
    the debate on panels in numerous cities. Participants have
    divided into two schools&#151;proponents of &#147;market socialism&#148;
    versus proponents of democratic or &#147;participatory
    planning&#148;with important differences of opinion within
    both camps. As an active partisan in these discussions, we
    would like to: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Restate our criticisms of market models that have not
            been adequately addressed by marketeers </li>
        <li>Defend participatory planning from frequent
            objections we do not find compelling, and </li>
        <li>Note some serious issues proponents of participatory
            economies must ponder in light of questions that have been
            raised. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Unaddressed Market Liabilities</h2>
    <h3>Markets Are Unfair</h3>
    <p>The distributive maxim implicit in public enterprise
    market economies is `to each according to the social value of his
    or her labor.' However, to the extent that productivity is
    the result of talent (the genetic lottery), education and training
    (frequently at public expense), or the quantity and quality
    of other productive inputs or of luck&#151;rather than
    greater personal effort or sacrifice&#151;payment according
    to productivity is unfair. It rewards people for things beyond
    their control and effort. </p>
    <p>But the inequity of some hard working people receiving
    lower wages and salaries than others who make lesser personal
    sacrifices but are lucky, have more education, are physically
    stronger, or work in better equipped factories, is
    unavoidable in any market economy. In a free market labor is
    paid at best and only roughly according to its marginal
    revenue product, which is the value the individual contributes
    to the product. But this usually differs significantly from
    the effort an individual expends. Moreover, any attempt to
    rectify the difference between what effort justifies and
    people's marginal productivities, <i>necessarily</i> leads to
    gross inefficiencies. Labor costs inevitably form a substantial portion
    of total production costs of most goods and services. In a market
    system, if wages differ from productivities to make them more equitable,
    labor costs, and consequently the entire cost structure of the economy,
    will deviate from true social opportunity costs. Since prices
    play an allocative role in every market model, this implies
    that any attempt to make wages more equitable must lead to significant allocative
    inefficiencies, even in a &#147;market socialist&#148;
    economy. </p>
    <p>Some advocates of &#147;market socialism&#148; recognize
    and admit this liability. &#147;A more just system of economic remuneration
    would arguably link payment solely to differential personal
    effort and personal sacrifice, not to the luck of the genetic
    draw.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 8) And: &#147;Even though our
    proposed system [market socialism] is likely to be more
    egalitarian than capitalism, there will be several departures
    from egalitarian distribution to the extent there are various
    incentive payment schemes for managers and workers.&#148; (Bardhan
    &amp; Roemer, 1992, page 14) And a few advocates of &#147;market socialism&#148;
    admit that the inequity in their system is not necessary for motivational
    efficiency any more than the inequity in capitalism is:
    &#147;In market capitalist economies people are rewarded for productive
    contributions due to the property they own (in the form of
    capital income); such rewards to property ownership not only
    have very unequal distribution consequences, but they are
    generally not necessary to assure deployment of the property
    in production. In `market socialist' economies people are
    rewarded primarily for productive contributions due to their
    own labor. Yet `market socialism,' like capitalism maintains rewards
    to people's natural abilities (in the form of labor income),
    even though such rewards may not really be necessary to
    elicit the deployment of those abilities in production.&#148;
    (Weisskopf 1992, page 8) </p>
    <p>Advocates who admit that &#147;market socialism&#148; is
    inequitable console themselves with the observation that capitalism
    is more inequitable, and the fact that progressive income
    taxes can ameliorate inequities: &#147;While `market socialist'
    systems do not achieve this ideal [payment according to
    effort], they do not depart from it anywhere near as much as
    do capitalist systems. Moreover, to the extent that
    unwarranted returns to a person due to their luck in the
    genetic lottery or in economic circumstances remain, the
    resulting differentials can be diminished by a progressive
    system of income taxation.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 8) </p>
    <p>Of course, the greater inequity of capitalism is not
    disputed by progressive critics of &#147;market socialism.&#148;
    And it is important to also note that advocates of &#147;market
    socialism&#148; conveniently ignore the psychological and
    political obstacles to tax correctives, as well as the
    inefficiency that would accompany such intervention. Isn't it
    likely in a &#147;market socialist&#148; society that the economically advantaged
    would translate their advantages in wealth and leisure into
    disproportionate political power? And isn't it likely their disproportionate
    political power would be used to obstruct tax reforms to correct
    wage and salary inequities? Moreover, besides greater
    economic and political power to defend their advantages,
    opponents of corrective progressive taxation in &#147;market
    socialist&#148; societies would have two powerful arguments
    on their side. First, while progressive taxes on personal
    income do not initially disrupt allocative efficiency, they
    do create dynamic, or motivational inefficiency in a system
    that relies heavily on material incentives&#151;as
    conservative opponents of progressive taxation have correctly pointed out
    in capitalist economies. Second, and more important in our
    view, people inevitably tend to rationalize their behavior.
    The logic of the labor market is: s/he who contributes more
    gets more. When people participate in the labor market they
    must defend their right to a wage on the basis of their contribution.
    The logic of redistribution through progressive taxation contradicts
    this logic. So participation in &#147;market socialist&#148;
    labor markets not only does not lead people to see the
    justice of progressive taxation, it inclines them to accept
    the argument of opponents, which is: &#147;Everyone already
    got what they contributed, so any after-the-fact
    redistribution would be unfair.&#148; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There is a further ethical dilemma in &#147;market
    socialism.&#148; Advocates of social democracy and &#147;market
    socialism&#148; invariably treat education as a fundamental human
    right and champion universal public education as a
    cornerstone needed to guarantee equality of economic
    opportunity and a democratic polity, We agree. But what is
    the sense of permitting individuals to appropriate the benefits
    of greater productivity that comes from education and training&#151;which
    they will in &#147;market socialism&#148;&#151;if the cost of
    that education and training is born at public expense? Market
    logic requires either that individuals bear the expense of
    education from which they reap the benefits in the form of higher
    wages and salaries, or that education at public expense not give
    rise to private benefits. But efficiency precludes the latter
    possibility in &#147;market socialism.&#148; It is therefore
    unclear how social democrats can wrap themselves in the
    mantel of generous universal public education and sing the praises
    of markets as well, without serious inconsistency. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Class Divisions</h3>
    <p>We have claimed on numerous occasions that &#147;markets
    create a social environment in which a class of managers, professionals,
    intellectuals and technicians&#151;who we call
    coordinators&#151;increasingly dominate and ultimately exploit
    ordinary workers.&#148; (Albert and Hahnel, 1992a, page 47)
    And some advocates of &#147;market socialism&#148; even admit
    this is the case. &#147;It is certainly true that under
    `market socialism' there must be some people occupying positions
    of key decision-making responsibility, and in all likelihood
    such people will have higher incomes as well as greater power
    than most of the rest of the population.... There would be
    ample scope for inequalities associated with differential
    skills, talents and responsibilities.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992,
    page 9) </p>
    <p>To quote another advocate of &#147;market socialism&#148;
    speaking more broadly: &#147;If democratic governance is a
    value, it seems reasonable to favor institutions that foster
    the development of people likely to support democratic institutions
    and able to function effectively in a democratic environment.
    Among the traits most students of the subject consider
    essential are the ability to process and communicate complex
    information, to make collective decisions, and the capacity
    to feel empathy and solidarity with others. As we have seen,
    markets may provide a hostile environment for the cultivation
    of these traits. Feelings of solidarity are more likely to
    flourish where economic relationships are ongoing and personal,
    rather than fleeting and anonymous; and where a concern for
    the needs of others is an integral part of the institutions
    governing economic life. The complex decision-making and information
    processing skills required of the modern democratic citizen
    are not likely to be fostered in either markets or in
    workplaces that run from the top down.&#148; (Bowles, 1991, page
    16) Bowles' main point here is that markets are not the
    training grounds for political democracy they are advertised
    to be in the mainstream equation of political democracy with
    free market economics. But the dearth of &#147;complex
    decision-making and information processing skills&#148; as
    well as empathy generated in market economies, and
    particularly the unequal distribution of these traits among participants,
    are precisely what make market systems breeding grounds for
    what we call &#147;coordinator class&#148; dynamics and distinctions. </p>
    <p>As with inequity, the defense mounted by advocates of
    &#147;market socialism&#148; is not to deny that &#147;market socialism&#148; fosters
    class differentiation, but to point out that the class
    inequalities would be less than those in capitalism, and to suggest
    that class differentiation is inevitable in any event.
    &#147;Although a market system could not assure anything close
    to full equality of income and power for all participants,
    neither could any economic system in a complex society. Such
    societies require sophisticated decision-making institutions
    of one kind or another; and there are bound to be great differences
    among people in their ability (or desire) to participate
    effectively in decision-making processes.&#148; (Weisskopf
    1992, page 9) </p>
    <p>While we agree that differential economic power and class
    distinctions are inevitable in &#147;market socialism,&#148;
    we believe specific features of a participatory economy make
    formation of classes unlikely, as we discuss below. Ironically,
    those like Weisskopf who are pessimistic about the possibilities
    of ever eliminating unequal decision making power are also among
    the first to criticize features of a participatory economy
    designed to minimize unequal economic power as infringing on individual
    freedoms. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Antisocial</h3>
    <p>While Bowles concludes his recent discussion of the pros
    and cons of markets with a plea for regulation rather than a
    call for a superior allocative mechanism, and while the
    sentiments he expresses about market's antisocial bias are
    very reminiscent of arguments we have made elsewhere (Albert
    and Hahnel, 1978; 1981, and Hahnel and Albert, Chapter 7,
    1990), we quote him because it is more significant when these
    problems are admitted by a defender of markets than espoused
    by market bashers like ourselves. </p>
    <p>Bowles writes: &#147;Even if market allocations did yield
    pareto-optimal results, and even if the resulting income distribution
    was thought to be fair (two very big `ifs', the market would
    still fail if it supported an undemocratic structure of power
    or if it rewarded greed, opportunism, political passivity,
    and indifference toward others. The central idea here is that
    our evaluation of markets&#151;and with it the concept of
    market failure&#151;must be expanded to include the effects
    of markets on both the structure of power and the process of human
    development.&#148; (Bowles, 1991, page 11) </p>
    <p>And continues: &#147;The beauty of the market, some would
    say, is precisely this: It works well even if people are indifferent
    toward one another. And it does not require complex
    communication or even trust among its participants. But that is
    also the problem. The economy&#151;its markets, workplaces
    and other sites&#151;is a gigantic school. Its rewards
    encourage the development of particular skills and attitudes
    while other potentials lay fallow or atrophy. We learn to
    function in these environments, and in so doing become
    someone we might not have become in a different
    setting.&#148; (Bowles, 1991, page 13) </p>
    <p>And concludes: &#147;By economizing on valuable
    traits&#151;feelings of solidarity with others, the ability
    to empathize, the capacity for complex communication and
    collective decision making, for example&#151;markets are said
    to cope with the scarcity of these worthy traits. But in the
    long run markets contribute to their erosion and even disappearance.
    What looks like a hardheaded adaptation to the infirmity of
    human nature may in fact be part of the problem.&#148; (Bowles,
    1991, page 13) </p>
    <p>Quite simply, We couldn't agree more. We have been playing
    these themes for close to two decades to largely empty
    houses. And we also agree with Weisskopf: &#147;Don't market
    systems systematically undermine efforts to serve the general
    public interests? Markets provide an environment in which people are
    encouraged to find ways to better themselves at the expense
    of others.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 8) And: &#147;To
    transact effectively in markets, people do have to think
    mainly in terms of their own individual (or family) welfare, while
    setting aside consideration for others; markets encourage anonymity, autonomy
    and mobility rather than community, empathy and solidarity.
    `Market socialism' thus admittedly does not provide direct
    support for a culture of community, empathy, and
    solidarity.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 9) </p>
    <p>But Weisskopf offers rebuttal to his own criticism:
    &#147;This line of reasoning is theoretically plausible; yet
    it is not decisive. Rent seeking behavior and self-aggrandizing
    coalitions of one kind or another can and will occur under any
    conceivable system of economic organization that permits some
    people to live better than others. Virtually every system
    will therefore require institutions that limit antisocial behavior.
    The only way in which an economic system of organization per
    se could eradicate the problem would be if that system, by
    virtue of its controls on individual patterns of living,
    precluded any individual from enjoying the gains from
    self-interested behavior. Thus a solution to the problem of
    such behavior could come only at the price of strict limits
    on privacy and freedom of choice&#151;a price that `market
    socialists' are unwilling to pay.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page
    8) [Of course, we deny this convenient
    &#147;impossibility.&#148;] Weisskopf finishes with the usual
    observation that capitalism is much worse, anyway, and a
    prayer that non-economic institutions may save the day:
    &#147;Yet [`market socialism'] surely does provide a less
    hostile environment for the development of empathy and solidarity
    than (market) capitalism.... [And] such [desirable
    personality] characteristics may be fostered in other spheres
    of life even in a market system.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page
    10) </p>
    <p>Let us state again, for the record, that `market
    socialism,' or what we prefer to call public enterprise market economies,
    are more desirable than market capitalism. We have no doubt
    that &#147;to each according to personal contribution&#148;
    is more equitable than &#147;to each according to
    contribution of person and property.&#148; And employee managed
    market economies obviously afford more opportunities for
    self-management than economies in which absentee owners
    manage the laboring capacities of others by means of hired henchmen.
    Moreover, the fact that advocates of &#147;market
    socialism&#148; are on the defensive in their debate with
    defenders of private ownership over the relative efficiency
    of the two systems is... amusing. If employee managed market
    regimes proved stable&#151;that is, if the logic of competition
    and accumulation did not lead to a restoration of private
    ownership&#151;We have no doubt they would prove more
    efficient as well as more equitable than capitalism. The
    motivational advantages of a greater degree of self-management
    in employee managed systems is considerable. And the inefficiency
    and waste caused by the conflict between owners and employees in
    employer managed systems is extensive as well. Moreover,
    claims that private capital markets are best suited to the
    task of weeding out those who are less adept at discovering
    and implementing innovations with the greatest net social
    benefits are preposterous on both logical and historical
    grounds. But this is not our major concern. We happily
    concede that employee managed market economies (what our opponents
    call &#147;market socialism&#148;) are more desirable than
    employer managed market economies, i.e. capitalism. </p>
    <p>But in return for our unqualified support in their debate
    with pro-capitalists, we think it only honest for
    &#147;market socialists&#148; to concede that the superiority of
    &#147;market socialism&#148; over capitalism has no bearing
    on a debate over the relative desirability of &#147;market
    socialism&#148; and democratic or participatory planning.
    Comments to the effect that &#147;market socialism&#148; is
    more fair than capitalism, or more democratic than
    capitalism, or more efficient than capitalism, carry no
    weight in a debate over whether participatory economies or
    &#147;market socialist&#148; economies are more equitable,
    democratic, or efficient. And we also fail to see why it
    should be of any comfort that non-economic institutions may prove
    more supportive of solidarity and democracy than markets.
    Logically it is just as possible that markets undermine
    solidarity and community in other spheres of social life as
    it is that solidaritous dynamics elsewhere will ameliorate
    the antisocial effects of markets. And as far as evidence is concerned,
    our sense of the last 500 years of history, aided by the insights
    of Karl Polanyi and countless anthropological studies, make
    the former hypothesis far more plausible. </p>
    <p>But, is it true, as Weisskopf claims, that &#147;rent
    seeking behavior and self-aggrandizing coalitions of one kind
    or another can and will occur under any conceivable system of
    economic organization&#148; so this problem is not due to markets
    but is a fact of economic life? </p>
    <p>Certainly Homo Economus&#151;who is well represented by
    the law firm of Micro, Neoclassico, and Marketo&#151;can be
    counted on to check out these possibilities in any system
    s/he is put in, including a participatory economy (to be
    discussed below.) But in market economies there are two
    avenues to self-aggrandizement: One is through socially
    beneficial behavior such as discovering and producing goods
    and services that others like rather than dislike, or
    discovering and implementing techniques that lower social
    costs of production. Adam Smith studied the beneficial logic
    of voluntary exchange long ago and dubbed it the
    &#147;invisible hand.&#148; But market economies offer another
    route to self-aggrandizement, namely advancing one's
    interests at the expense of the interests of others. Smith believed,
    erroneously, that competitive market structures and full
    information closed down this second route to
    self-aggrandizement, thereby securing the invisible hand. In
    actual practice, however, while competitive conditions
    diminish opportunities to pursue this route of
    self-advancement by providing others one might disadvantage
    with opportunities for exit, this does not eliminate a multitude
    of opportunities for self-advancement in market economies
    which are socially counter productive. E.K. Hunt pointed to
    externalities as a plentiful source for such opportunities,
    identified externalities as the Achilles heel of market economies
    with respect to efficiency, and dubbed the dynamic whereby markets
    provide incentives for socially counter productive individual advancement the
    &#147;invisible foot&#148; (Hunt and D'Arge, 1973).
    Environmental economists such as Jacobs have used the term
    invisible elbow. We have explained elsewhere why political
    economists should expect externalities to be much more
    prevalent than neoclassical economists admit, and why recognizing
    that people's preferences are endogenous magnifies the
    socially counter productive potentials of Hunt's invisible
    foot and Jacobs' invisible elbow. (Hahnel and Albert,
    Chapters 6 and 7, 1990). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Still, Weisskopf is right that in a system that not only
    relies exclusively on material self-aggrandizement as the means
    of motivating behavior, but aggressively penalizes any and
    all failures to do so, socially counter productive,
    &#147;rent seeking&#148; behavior will occur unless there are &#147;institutions that
    limit antisocial behavior.&#148; But there are two
    insuperable obstacles to erecting adequate corrective
    institutions of this kind in market economies. First, there
    are too many holes in the market system dike. As Hunt demonstrates,
    the solution of creating new markets in the external effects
    is no solution at all and actually compounds the problem. And
    we have demonstrated that any conceivably adequate system of
    incentive compatible mechanisms for dealing with the ubiquitous public
    effects of private actions would transform a market system
    into something bearing little resemblance to a &#147;free
    market&#148; economy. (Hahnel and Albert, 1990, chapter 7)
    Second, any institution that closed down a socially counter
    productive avenue of self-advancement would also undermine
    people's motivation to innovate, invest, and/or work in a
    market economy. </p>
    <p>In short, the &#147;human&#148; logic of market economies
    is very simple: They dangle opportunities for individuals to capture
    rents before people's eyes. If people are permitted to
    capture those rents both inequities and inefficiencies result. But
    if people are prevented from capturing those rents (by well designed &#147;institutions
    that limit antisocial behavior&#148;) there is little reason
    for people to &#147;play the market game.&#148; How can
    &#147;socialist&#148; marketeers pretend to have their cake
    and eat it too? </p>
    <p>But this is not an answer to Weisskopf's argument above.
    He does not deny this dilemma exists in market economies&#151;although
    he does not go out of his way to highlight it either. Instead
    he asserts that this problem exists in &#147;any conceivable
    system of economic organization that permits some people to live better
    than others,&#148; and implies that any system which did not
    permit some people to live better than others is undesirably
    restrictive of &#147;privacy and freedom of choice.&#148; We
    will take up these issues below in the context of a participatory
    economy. But we can state here that participatory economies were
    designed in large part: (1) To reduce to a minimum the possibility
    of socially counter productive self-advancement. (2) To
    prevent some people from &#147;living better&#148; than others unless
    they had undergone greater personal sacrifice (in which case
    you might say they do not live better than others in the overall
    context). And (3) To do all this without any infringement on
    privacy and freedom other than when necessary to prevent a
    greater infringement on the privacy and/or freedom of others. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Inefficiency</h3>
    <p>In the <i>Review of Radical Political Economics</i>
    special issue on &#147;The Future of Socialism&#148; we
    stated the case regarding efficiency politely: &#147;Received wisdom
    not withstanding, markets allocate resources very
    inefficiently.&#148; (Albert and Hahnel, 1992a, page 47) We
    will summarize the reasons here again so &#147;market
    socialist's can explain which of our argument(s) and or assumption(s)
    they dispute. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rather than exceptions, external effects (where
            parties external to a transaction are affected by the transaction)
            are the rule. The prevalence and unevenness of
            external effects means that market prices generally misestimate
            true social costs and benefits leading to a general misallocation
            of resources. (For one source see Hunt 1973.) </li>
        <li>Since people are more interactive with their economic
            institutions than neoclassical theory admits, the biases
            introduced in the terms of availability of different
            goods and services in market economies are magnified
            over time as people learn to adjust to those biases.
            That is, to a considerable degree, to be able to get
            on without constant frustration, we mold our
            preferences to fit the circumstances we find
            ourselves in. (For one source see theorem 6.6 in
            Hahnel and Albert, 1990.) </li>
        <li>Points 1 and 2 combine to imply that free market
            systems do not get prices &#147;right.&#148; In fact,
            they get most prices &#147;wrong,&#148; and get
            important ones wrong by a considerable margin. This
            implies a significant and general misallocation of
            resources in market economies (See theorem 7.2 in Hahnel
            and Albert, 1990)a conclusion directly at odds with
            the view long held by mainstream economists (now
            echoed with no further argument by advocates of
            &#147;market socialism&#148;) that whatever else one may
            like or dislike about markets, at least they yield
            allocative efficiency. But there are further reasons
            for doubting that markets yield allocative efficiency.
            The above criticisms were not the basis for the widespread
            opposition to markets on efficiency grounds among
            socialists and political economists that existed
            until recently. Until recently many critics of capitalism
            argued that: </li>
        <li>Market competition unavoidably leads to oligopoly
            with consequent inefficiencies. And </li>
        <li>inefficient business cycles and sectoral imbalances
            could only be partially alleviated by stabilization policies.
            It is ironic that from the 1930s through the 1970s
            when significant progress was made in the theory and
            practice of stabilization policies and indicative
            planning, political economists held firm to their conviction
            that market disequilibrium was a serious, perhaps
            fatal flaw. But during the late 1980s and early 1990s
            when there has been little if any theoretical or empirical
            work that even purports to shed new light on these
            subjects and the inefficiencies resulting from market
            disequilibria have increased dramatically, a majority
            of political economists have altered their assessment
            substantially. Suddenly, problems that were once
            deemed serious are now considered insignificant on
            the basis of no new evidence! Of course, we are not
            suggesting there are no new reasons for the about
            face. The dramatic, recent increase in the political
            and ideological hegemony of pro-market forces is
            obvious to all, as is the demise of what was widely
            assumed to be the only alternative to market allocations.
            But neither of these changes has any logical bearing
            on the degree to which market allocations are, in fact,
            inefficient due to non-competitive structures and disequilibrium
            dynamics. They have bearing only on ideological
            reasons, or professional reasons, or perhaps, arguably,
            political reasons, for holding views--not on
            evidentiary or analytical reasons for doing so. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Pat Devine poses the challenge to market efficiency based
    on points 4 and 5 as follows: &#147;My overall conclusion is
    that models of `market socialism' represent an attempt to
    square the circle. `Market socialism' is advocated because
    markets are alleged to be efficient in generating information
    and motivating enterprises to act on the basis of that
    information.... However, the British school of &#147;market
    socialism&#148; is understandably reluctant to accept this logic,
    for two basic reasons. First, there is the recognition that
    atomistic decision-making with respect to investment
    necessarily involves market uncertainty.... This is what
    underlies the argument for indicative planning and industrial
    policy as ways of seeking to reduce market uncertainty
    without limiting enterprise independence. Yet, unless enterprise
    independence is limited, market uncertainty cannot be
    overcome. The second reason for reluctance to accept the
    logic of efficiency through the market is the desire to allow
    wider social considerations than those determining enterprise profitability
    to influence enterprise decision-making.... If wider social considerations
    are to be taken into account, either the independence of the enterprise
    to pursue profit maximization must be limited, or the
    enterprise must be constituted in a way that directly
    involves representatives of social interests in the decision-making
    process.&#148; (Devine, 1992, page 76) In our view, Devine is
    right. Enterprise independence and the profit criterion are hallmarks
    of market systems. Moreover, once one admits that efficiency requires
    abandoning these features, it is hard to maintain support for
    the efficiency of market economies since these features are
    the basis for claims to the efficiency of markets in the
    first place! </p>
    <p>Finally, Chris Tilly typifies the understandable, but
    illogical recent turn-about of many political economists:
    &#147;I can recite a list of reasons why capitalist markets
    don't work: They feed boom-and-bust cycles, fail to provide needed goods
    such as clean air, and waste economic resources in ways
    ranging from unemployment to advertising expenditures. But
    before consigning markets to the dust-bin of history,
    consider a friend's visit to a store selling government-subsidized
    goods in revolutionary Nicaragua in 1987. The only goods on
    the shelves were sanitary napkins and Lenin's collected
    works.... Let's face it: We need markets of some kind.
    Markets do not ensure that everybody gets enough rice to
    survive, but they do a good job of matching up needs with
    suppliers in complex modern economies.&#148; (Tilly, 1992,
    page 6) We're sorry, but markets are no better (or worse) at allocating resources efficiently
    in Peru or the United States than they were before the demise
    of communism and the second coming of Monsieur &#147;laissez
    faire&#148; as the world's Savior. </p>

    <h2>Criticisms Of Participatory Economics</h2>
    <p>Participatory economics has been offered as a model for a
    better economic system via a number of books and articles.
    Its defining features are </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Councils of workers and consumers ot various levels
            (factory, industry, neighborhood, region, etc) </li>
        <li>Job complexes in workplaces balanced for empowerment
            and desirability </li>
        <li>Remuneration in accord with effort </li>
        <li>Decision-making by democratic vote with each actor
            and unit having a say proportionate to the degree it
            is affected by decisions, and </li>
        <li>Allocation by a system of institutions and practices
            we call participatory planning. Surprisingly, few if
            any critics have claimed that participatory economics
            is infeasible, i.e. unlikely to work as we say.
            Instead, the focus of criticism has been on whether
            or not it is desirable, i.e. a system people would
            want to live and work in. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>Unfree</h3>
    <p>Critics of participatory economics claim that it
    sacrifices personal freedom to attain other, in their view,
    less important, ends. Weisskopf argues, for example:
    &#147;The issue is how much value we should attach to the opportunity for
    individuals to exercise such libertarian rights as freedom of
    choice, privacy, and the development of one's own specialized
    talents and abilities&#151;as compared to the more
    traditional socialist goals of equity, democracy and
    solidarity.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 21) For Weisskopf, therefore,
    the debate between participatory economies and &#147;market
    socialism&#148; largely reduces to a debate over the relative
    importance of different values. He would have readers believe that
    while participatory economies may better serve
    &#147;traditional socialist goals&#148; like equity, democracy,
    and solidarity, it does so only at the expense of
    &#147;libertarian values&#148; such as individual freedom and
    privacy, which in his view are better served by market
    systems. We find the charge that participatory economies
    sacrifices libertarian values to be entirely without basis,
    deriving from a shallow and indefensible interpretation of
    libertarianism and a biased reading of what composes participatory economics. So,
    for reasons we clarify below, we reject framing the debate as a
    choice between worthy values, and reject Weisskopf's
    conclusion based on that assumption: &#147;Participatory economies
    best serves one set of `high principles,' while &#147;market
    socialism&#148; best serves a different set of equally `high
    principles.' But market socialism is less ambitious, closer
    to what we already have, and therefore more easily
    achievable.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 22) </p>
    <p>But what is a libertarian economy? If people are
    restricted, for example, from buying another human being, is
    an economy thereby made less libertarian? Surely there are
    circumstances that would lead people knowingly and willingly
    to sell themselves into slavery, yet few would refuse to call
    an economy libertarian because slavery was outlawed.
    Likewise, if people are restricted from hiring the services
    of another human being for a wage, is an economy thereby made
    less libertarian? There are familiar circumstances that lead
    people knowingly and willingly to accept what
    &#147;traditional socialists&#148; called &#147;wage
    slavery.&#148; Does this mean that Weisskopf's model of &#147;market socialism,&#148;
    is not libertarian because the employer/employee relation is outlawed?
    To equate libertarianism with freedom of individuals to do whatever
    they please is a shallow interpretation that robs libertarianism of merit
    it richly deserves. </p>
    <p>It is of course a good thing for people to be free to do
    what they please&#151;at least, insofar as what they choose
    to do does not infringe on more important freedoms or rights
    of others. I should not be free to kill you because that would
    be robbing you of a more fundamental freedom to live. I
    should not be free to own you because that robs you of a more
    fundamental freedom to live your own life. I should not be
    free to employ you because that robs you of a more
    fundamental freedom to manage your own laboring capacities. I
    should not be free to bequeath substantial inheritance to my
    children because that robs the children of less wealthy
    parents of their more fundamental right to an equal opportunity in
    life. Presumably, there is little disagreement about any of
    this between advocates of &#147;market socialism&#148; and
    proponents of participatory economies. But are there
    additional fundamental freedoms and rights that others should
    not be free to violate in choosing to do what they please?
    And is one difference between &#147;market socialism&#148;
    and participatory economics that participatory economies unjustifiably
    curtail personal freedoms that markets respect, or that
    markets violate rights participatory economies protect? </p>
    <p>Advocates of participatory economics think everyone should
    have equal opportunity to participate in making economic
    decisions in proportion to the degree they are affected. We
    think, in fact, that this is the only way to interpret what
    &#147;economic freedom&#148; means without having one
    person's freedom conflict with another's, and we call this
    goal economic &#147;self-management.&#148; We think economic self-management,
    in precisely this sense, is a fundamental right, so that
    allowing people freedom to do what they want must not permit
    them to infringe on others' right to self-management. In
    other words, we do not think some people should be free to
    appropriate disproportionate decision making power, leaving
    others with less. In more familiar terms, we do not think
    some should be &#147;free&#148; to oppress others with their
    greater economic power. But we do not think ourselves any
    less libertarian for wanting to outlaw this type of oppression,
    any more than abolitionists thought themselves less libertarian
    for fighting to outlaw slavery. </p>
    <p>Advocates of participatory economics also think
    distributing the burdens and benefits of economic activity
    fairly, or equitably, means people should benefit in
    proportion to their effort, or personal sacrifice. So we
    believe economic justice requires that nobody be
    &#147;free&#148; to appropriate more goods and services than
    warranted by their personal sacrifice. In more familiar
    terms, we do not think some should be &#147;free&#148; to
    exploit others. And, again, we do not think ourselves any
    less libertarian for wanting to outlaw exploitation, anymore
    than progressives thought themselves less libertarian for fighting
    for progressive income taxation in the early Twentieth
    century. </p>
    <p>But does this take all the fun out of freedom? If freedom
    does not include the freedom to oppress and exploit others,
    what is left? Is a &#147;politically correct&#148; economy--ie.
    one free from oppression and exploitation&#151;a drab and regimented
    world, as critics seem to believe? </p>
    <p>We see no reason to think so. People in a participatory
    economy are free to develop and pursue preferences for any
    goods and services they wish. They are free to choose more
    consumption and less leisure, or visa versa. They are free to
    distribute their effort and consumption over their lives
    anyway they want. They are free to apply to work wherever
    they want, free to bid on any job complex at their work place
    they want, and free to organize a new enterprise to produce
    whatever they want, however they want, with whomever they
    want. People are free to educate themselves in any career
    they want and train for any tasks they want. They're just not
    free to do any of these things in ways that oppress or exploit
    others. </p>
    <p>Suppose I'm intellectually gifted, score high on
    standardized tests, do well in my undergraduate studies, am admitted
    to medical school, and follow with a specialty in brain
    surgery. Shouldn't I be free to sell my talents or skills to whomever
    I wish? In a free market economy there would be others willing
    to pay me up to the value of my contribution. But if this is
    permitted, there will be others who receive less than the
    effort, or sacrifice, they incur. There is no way around it: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If some receive more than their efforts warrant,
            others will receive less than their efforts warrant. </li>
        <li>Those who receive less than their efforts warrant do
            so because others receive more than their efforts warrant.
            And </li>
        <li>This means those who receive more than their efforts
            warrant are exploiting those who receive less than their
            efforts warrant. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Or, suppose I'm particularly competent and energetic and
    more than willing to spend all my work time analyzing and
    evaluating different options for my workers' council.
    Shouldn't I be free to work in a job complex where I am engaged
    full time in analytical and decision-making activities? But
    if I am permitted to work at a job complex significantly more
    empowering than others, before long my work mates' formally
    equal opportunities to participate in economic
    self-management will not be effectively equal to mine. </p>
    <p>What appear to be simple desires for &#147;personal
    freedom&#148; are not always so simple. But there is another
    way to see the logic of participatory economics: from the
    bottom up. The first priority is to guarantee economic
    justice for those who have never enjoyed it by making sure
    that people's consumption is commensurate with their sacrifices
    and by making sure that people's work experience equips them
    to participate in economic decision making should they want
    to. And there is also another way to look at talent and
    education. A participatory economy encourages people to use
    their talents. In a participatory economy esteem and social
    recognition for outstanding abilities that create great social
    benefits for others will be very high. The idea is not to keep
    people from using their talent or education. But there is no
    material reward for anything other than effort and sacrifice&#151;since
    to do otherwise would be inequitable. And while those with
    greater talent and education may spend part of their work
    time analyzing complicated consequences, and may have their
    opinions more highly regarded than others because
    historically their opinions have been more accurate, they do
    not get greater decision making <i>authority</i> in a
    participatory economy because this would infringe on the self-management
    rights of others. </p>
    <p>We wish to emphasize that personal freedoms are not
    sacrificed in the interest of solidarity or community in a participatory
    economy. This concern, voiced by advocates of markets, has no
    basis. Only protecting the freedoms of others and the
    dictates of justice limit the freedoms individuals enjoy in a participatory
    economy. And in our view limiting one individual's personal freedom
    or rights because they infringe on the more important
    freedoms or rights of others is perfectly consistent with the
    only kind of libertarianism that can be justified. </p>
    <p>So how do we answer specific criticisms that participatory
    economies are &#147;unfree?&quot; </p>
    <p>For example, &#147;Wouldn't a participatory economic
    system tend to be too intrusive in restricting individuality, privacy,
    and freedom of choice?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 18) And:
    &#147;The more weight one places on... individuality,
    privacy, and freedom of choice... the more skeptical one will
    be about the desirability of participatory socialism.&#148;
    (Weisskopf 1992, page 20) </p>
    <p>In fact, there simply are no restrictions on individuality
    or privacy in participatory economics. Anyone who wishes to
    submit anonymous consumption proposals and avoid feedback
    from neighbors about the content of their consumption
    requests is free to do so. Many people have reasonably good relations
    with their neighbors and would appreciate helpful
    suggestions. But if this is not the case, in a participatory
    economy privacy in consumption is available with no questions
    asked. We see no reason to think that other privacy issues
    are any less tractible in a participatory economy than any other. Regarding
    freedom of choice, as explained above, it is restricted only
    when it infringes on the freedom of choice of others and only
    in ways that distribute decision-making authority in
    proportion to the degree people are affected. </p>
    <p>Weisskopf says: &#147;Freedom of choice&#151;in how to
    live, what to consume, what kind of work to do, how to
    express oneself, how to define one's social identity,
    etc.&#151;is an important value.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page
    19) Exacly. And there is complete freedom of choice in where
    and how to live, what to consume, how to express oneself, and
    how to define one's social identity in a participatory
    economy. Presumptions to the contrary are unfounded. And the restrictions
    on what kind of work people do&#151;that job complexes be
    balanced for empowerment&#151;are only those necessary to
    protect everyone's right to economic self-management. </p>
    <p>And Weisskopf says: &#147;A participatory system is likely
    to require people to justify many of their choices... to some kind
    of collective decision-making body, which in turn is bound to
    limit the extent to which people can really get their choices
    accepted&#151;no matter how democratically decision-making bodies
    are constituted. By enabling individuals to make most choices
    without reference to what others think about their decisions,
    a market system provides much greater freedom of this
    kind.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 19) But, if a participatory
    economy achieves its goal of self-management&#151;which we understand
    can only be approximate&#151;then only people affected by decisions will
    have influence over those decisions, and only to the degree
    they are affected. If life style, social identity, and what
    kinds of goods to consume are decisions that only affect an individual&#151;and
    we agree, for the most part, that they are&#151;then
    individuals will have control over those decisions in a participatory
    economy. But there are many decisions some individuals make
    in a market system that affect other people as well. A participatory
    economy is designed to provide others affected with influence
    proportionate to the magnitude of what are
    &#147;external&#148; effects in a market system. We believe
    this is only seen as intrusive from the perspective of people
    accustomed to a market system where people make decisions
    without reference to the opinion of others even when those
    others are affected by the outcome. True, factory owners are
    used to being &#147;free&#148; to pollute the air in market
    economies and chafe at environmental regulations. Those who
    make decisions that affect others in market systems are used
    to being &#147;free&#148; from the opinions and influence of
    others. But those affected by decisions in a market system
    who have neither voice nor influence just as surely have their
    freedom curtailed. The question is not &#147;free&#148; or
    &#147;unfree&#148; but when unrestricted freedom is legitimate
    and when it is not. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Weisskopf says: &#147;Many people are likely to prefer
    doing more specialized work activities than would be permitted
    under a balanced job-complex requirement which means that
    enforcement of the requirement might well involve implicit or
    explicit coercion.... Apart from their inhibition of personal freedom,
    balanced job complexes designed to avoid specialization seem likely
    to deprive society of the benefits of activities performed
    well only by people who have devoted a disproportionate
    amount of time and effort to them.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992,
    page 20) First of all, balanced job complexes are not designed
    to avoid specialization. They are designed to avoid disparate empowerment
    and desirability. As already explained, this is to protect
    the freedom of those who otherwise would not have equal
    opportunity to participate in economic decision making, and
    to ensure equity. It is designed to prevent oppression and
    class divisions. But it does not curtail specialization as
    usually understood. People will still specialize in brain surgery,
    electrical engineering, high voltage welding, etc. But those
    who perform these specialized tasks if they are more empowering
    than average tasks, will also perform less empowering tasks
    as well. And if these tasks are more desirable than average,
    those who perform them will perform some less desirable tasks
    as well, unless they wish to accept a lower effort rating. We admit
    this does require training more brain surgeons, electrical
    engineers, and welders than if none of these specialists ever
    had to work at any other tasks, assuming, for the sake of
    discussion, that skilled workers didn't use their advantages
    to reduce their work time in any event which imposes the same social
    cost. But this does not mean an end to specialization, nor
    mean that society will be deprived &#147;of the benefits of
    activities performed well only by people who have devoted a
    disproportionate amount of time and effort to them.&#148; </p>
    <p>Weisskopf says: &#147;Critics of participatory socialism
    question whether it can adequately protect the legitimate interests
    of those who hold and wish to act on minority views. True
    democracy requires not only that people have more or less
    equal influence over decisions that affect them to the same degree,
    but that minorities be protected from majority
    decisions&#151;however equally and fairly arrived at&#151;which
    disadvantage them in important ways.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page
    18) But advocates of participatory socialism, such as the
    well known libertarian, Noam Chomsky, are among the first to recognize
    the importance of protecting minority views and rights. This
    is a matter of civil liberties and protection of civil
    liberties. And while we have not written much on this subject&#151;since
    we have no particular expertise in constitutional law, civil rights,
    and civil liberties&#151;we see nothing in the procedures of
    participatory economies that make protection of minority
    views or rights more difficult than their protection in other
    kinds of economies. The only opinion we ever expressed on
    this matter was to argue for the importance of implementing minority
    plans for economic projects along with majority plans,
    whenever possible. We argued this is preferable because it is
    not only desirable for minorities to allow them to pursue
    their ideas, it is better for the majority as well, to have
    contrary opinions tested by their advocates since no majority
    has ever been right all the time. If there is something
    specific in the procedures of participatory economies that
    threatens minority rights and interests we would like very
    much to hear what it is so it can be reexamined and
    corrected. </p>
    <p>Nancy Folbre says: &#147;The tone of <i>Looking Forward</i>
    sometimes reminds me of a parent telling the kids they can't have
    any dessert until they've eaten their spinach. Albert/Hahnel
    sound just as certain that they are right about what's healthy
    and what's not. They are willing to allow the children to
    choose different jobs but not to choose specialization and
    hierarchy. I think many children may feel just as oppressed
    by this rule as by current structures of constraint that
    preserve free choice for the privileged few.... Individuals
    who don't like aspects of their job, specified for them by
    the larger group, may be as likely to shirk as those who feel
    that capitalists or coordinators are in control.&#148; (Folbre,
    1991, page 70) We apologize for our tone if it was condescending.
    We did not feel at all certain we were right about how best
    to pursue economic democracy, equity, and solidarity when we published <i>Looking
    Forward</i> and <i>Participatory Economics</i>. Instead, we
    felt the discussion of what constitutes a desirable economy
    had gotten badly muddled in the context of recent world
    events. We also felt that a degree of professional managerial
    class &#147;skin privilege&#148; had intruded into the
    debate. When working to build a movement dedicated to
    democracy and justice it is critical to examine the possibility
    of convenient &#147;blind spots.&#148; Few engaged in the
    debate over &#147;market socialism&#148; versus participatory
    planning have large amounts of private capital they may be
    tempted to rationalize. There is little need for
    self-scrutiny on that account. But many of us do enjoy
    advantages in human capital, and empowering, desirable job
    complexes. In this context, we wished to clarify some issues
    we find critical and present an alternative to both central
    planning and &#147;market socialism&#148; that was sufficiently
    coherent to permit others to evaluate it seriously. And we
    are gratified that to an extent a serious evaluation has
    occurred. But that does not bind us to agree with all criticisms.
    And not agreeing is not the same as claiming omniscience. </p>
    <p>Yes, we have presented a case against hierarchical
    relations of production, as well as a set of procedures to prevent
    hierarchy from sneaking in the back door after the front door
    is barred. We do not believe we have thereby prohibited
    specialization, but we are aware that some aspects of balanced
    job complexes will not be personally gratifying to those who
    carry them out. On the other hand there are many aspects of
    most people's jobs in capitalist or &#147;market
    socialist&#148; economies that are not gratifying to those
    who must carry them out, which most assuredly does lead to
    shirking. But as long as there are unpleasant tasks&#151;and
    unlike traditional Marxists and modern day high tech utopians,
    we believe this will always be the case&#151;someone will
    have to do them. The difference in a participatory economy is
    not that nobody will ever have to perform a task they
    dislike, but that a valid case can be made that any task in a
    job complex that is not gratifying is there because it would be
    unfair if it were not. How much less shirking would take
    place in an economy where unpleasant tasks are fairly
    distributed, remains to be seen. </p>
    <p>Weisskopf says: &#147;Certain libertarian objectives
    associated with personal freedom of choice can best be
    satisfied only if individuals have the kind of opportunities
    for choice and for exit that a market system alone can
    provide.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 22) The assumption that
    &#147;exit&#148; is more difficult in participatory economies
    than other systems is unfounded. In capitalist economies what
    can workers do who don't like their boss? In public
    enterprise market economies what can you do if you don't like your
    boss or the majority decisions of your work mates? Switching
    work places or starting up a new enterprise is the exit
    option in any economy. In a participatory economy, workers
    are free to leave their workplaces and apply for work in any
    other workplace. And we believe participatory economies'
    iteration facilitation boards would make finding a new, more
    compatible work site easier than even social democratic
    Swedish-style Labor Market Boards. Moreover, convincing an
    industry federation committee of the social usefulness of a
    new enterprise is similar to convincing a bank&#151;whether privately
    or publicly owned&#151;that a new enterprise will prove
    profitable. As for what you do if you come to dislike your
    neighbors&#151;if it gets bad enough you move in a participatory economy,
    just like you do in any other economy. But with your income
    secure, and consumer facilitation boards for assistance,
    again, it should be easier. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Insufficient Incentives</h3>
    <p>When working on the procedures for a participatory economy
    we assumed the primary concern would be with allocational, or
    static efficiency. After all, we were advocating abandoning
    both markets and central planning, which most economists
    presume are the only conceivable ways to determine the social opportunity
    costs of productive resources in order to allocate them
    efficiently. In the words of Sam Bowles: &#147;The debate
    proceeds as if the menu of institutional choices offers just
    two items: command&#151;meaning centralized planning; and competition&#151;meaning
    the neoclassical textbook rendition of the market. Our task,
    one imagines, is to find some judicious combination of these two conceptually
    homogeneous and unproblematic poles.... But the plan versus market
    debate reflects an impoverished view of markets and the
    alternatives to markets, one that thwarts the consideration
    of the essential political and moral issues: namely, the
    manner in which markets shape human development and structure
    the exercise of power. Thus if the economists first
    disability is to ignore the non-economic impacts of economic
    choices, the second is the economist's tendency to assume
    that the alternative to the invisible hand is Big Brother's
    fist.&#148; (Bowles, 1991, page 11-12) So we assumed this was
    the major obstacle&#151;demonstrating that a qualitatively
    new allocation procedure was capable of generating accurate estimates
    of social opportunity costs and thereby able to allocate resources
    efficiently. </p>
    <p>Predictably, those who practice free market ideology as
    their religion and presume that only markets can allocate resources
    efficiently, felt no need to examine the procedures of
    participatory planning or the analysis we offered. But
    surprisingly, among those whose faith is less strong, and who
    examined the procedures of participatory planning, none has
    challenged our claim that, in theory, participatory planning
    will yield socially efficient outcomes under less restrictive
    conditions than market models. Some find participatory planning
    undesirably cumbersome and time consuming, but no one has claimed it
    fails to yield efficient outcomes under the assumptions we
    specified. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, there has been widespread skepticism
    about participatory economies' ability to employ scarce human
    talents and skills efficiently, and to achieve dynamic, or
    motivational efficiency. Would balanced job complexes under
    employ scarce talents and socially costly training? Would
    people be motivated to work sufficiently hard? Would efforts
    be directed toward fulfilling socially desirable needs? Would
    people be sufficiently motivated to pursue education and
    training in socially useful careers and skills? Would individuals
    be sufficiently motivated to search for new innovations?
    Would workers' councils be adequately motivated to pursue and
    implement new innovations? Would participatory economies be
    sufficiently dynamic? </p>
    <p>Folbre argues: &#147;Personal endowments as well as
    preferences differ greatly. Up to a point, specialization
    provides important efficiency gains. A certain level of
    specialization and hierarchy lowers transactions and training
    costs.&#148; (Folbre, 1991, page 70) Indeed, specialization
    does lower training costs. So we agree that requiring those
    whose training is more socially costly than average to also
    perform tasks in areas requiring less training incurs extra social
    costs since it means more people must receive socially costly
    training. But we pointed out that this efficiency loss needs
    to be weighed against efficiency gains from <i>real </i>worker
    self-management, better morale among workers, and greater
    familiarity with the overall work process for all workers. If
    there are still net efficiency losses, which we find
    unlikely, these are the price of making self-management real,
    rather than a hollow sham. </p>
    <p>While hierarchy does lower transaction costs, this does
    not mean that we must tolerate permanent hierarchies. Permanent
    hierarchies subvert self-management and create class
    distinctions. But clearly enforced lines of responsibility
    and authority in workplaces do not require permanent hierarchies. Making
    sure that workers who exercise managerial authority in one
    area are subject to authority from others in other areas
    lowers transaction costs in production just as much as
    permanent hierarchies do, but without creating social
    inequities. </p>
    <p>Alec Nove complains that: &#147;In the absence of a market
    `the supplier is usually designated by the supply plan, and is
    therefore in a position of an absolute monopolist.' The
    supplier therefore can sacrifice quality to meeting quantity goals,
    by which fulfillment is measured. `I can be meaningfully instructed
    to give 50 lectures, but it is not so easy to enforce an
    order that I give good lectures.' How can one measure quality
    except by consumer choice, which negates planned supply, in
    turn negating plan, and which requires a market?&#148; (Mandel,
    1993, page 350 quoting Alec Nove) In fact, in participatory economies
    consumer councils and federations, answerable only to the consumers
    they represent, are the recipients of deliveries. We see no
    reason to believe quality will go uncontested under these
    circumstances. Negotiations over expectations and quality
    between consumer and producer federations rather than between
    individual consumers and suppliers should increase pressure
    on producers to maintain quality. Is it harder for producers
    to hoodwink Ralph Nader consumer protection organizations or
    the average individual citizen? </p>
    <p>Weisskopf says: &#147;Wouldn't it be very wasteful to try
    to allocate labor without an incentive system that rewards individuals
    according to the market-determined value of their work
    contributions?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 16) Well, it is
    true that in participatory economies workers are not
    &#147;paid&#148; according to the social value of their contributions.
    Workers are &#147;paid&#148; according to effort expended on
    the job, because that is what is fair. But the process of
    participatory planning charges workplaces for workers
    according to the value of their laboring capacities in their
    most socially useful and efficient employment. And since
    participatory planning is the procedure for allocating labor
    in a participatory economy, Weisskopf's concern does not apply
    to a participatory economy. Yes, in market economies
    allocating labor efficiently requires paying people
    &#147;according to the market-determined value of their work
    contributions,&#148; which means market systems must pay
    people unfairly. But participatory economies have been
    designed precisely so we can have our cake and eat it too.
    People are compensated fairly&#151;wages based on effort&#151;but
    labor is allocated according to productivity&#151;users are
    charged true social opportunity costs. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Mark Hagar argues: &#147;Because success, even in a
    non-capitalist order, may easily turn on talent, luck, and
    other morally undeserved factors, it is easy for the authors
    to show that equity favors distribution according to effort. My question,
    however, is whether they succeed in showing that distribution according
    to effort achieves efficiency alongside equity.... A society
    seeking optimum production needs to discourage clumsy effort
    and encourage proficient effort so as to avoid waste.
    Otherwise, the less successful have no material incentive to modify
    bungling methods or to seek work where their comparative
    advantage in contribution is greater. For efficiency, one
    must at least reward efforts to improve the success of
    efforts, and rewarding contribution may be the only feasible
    way to do so.&#148; (Hagar, 1991, page 71) </p>
    <p>And Weisskopf adds: &#147;They [Albert &amp; Hahnel]
    propose that the consumption opportunities available to individuals
    be linked to an individual's input into the production
    process&#151;in the form of personal effort made or personal sacrifice
    endured... Albert &amp; Hahnel's proposal would surely lead
    to greater equity in the reward for labor than the
    market-based alternative, but their claim of greater
    efficiency is misguided.... First of all, it is very difficult
    to observe and measure an individual's sacrifice or work
    effort.... Any input-oriented incentive scheme would tend to
    encourage the substitution of quantity for quality of effort.
    Moreover, people would have an interest in understating their
    natural talents and abilities.... Second... [while] it would presumably
    elicit greater work effort and sacrifice on the part of
    individuals, it would do nothing to assure that such effort
    and sacrifice were expended in a desirable way. The social
    good is best served by encouraging activities the results of
    which are highly valued relative to the cost of undertaking
    those activities. In order to motivate people to expend their efforts
    in a desirable way, it is therefore necessary to reward
    activities according to the value of work output rather than
    according to the quantity of work input.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992,
    page 16-17) </p>
    <p>Hagar and Weisskopf make an important point here. It is a
    different point than the previous concern with allocating
    labor to its most productive use. Here the issue is whether
    people who are rewarded for effort and sacrifice will be motivated
    to expend their efforts in socially desirable ways rather
    than clumsily. For example, will they work to produce more,
    rather than better? </p>
    <p>In market economies a single incentive is used to motivate
    both quantity and quality of effort and to direct effort in socially
    desirable ways&#151;material rewards for the value of
    outcome. But rewarding the value of outcome does not just
    reward these three things. It also rewards talent and
    luck&#151;luck in what job one occupies and with what equipment
    and work mates one works, luck in whether applied effort
    yields smaller or greater output, and luck in one's own, or
    someone else's guess about what others find socially useful.
    So market economies do not reward only the things that
    efficiency requires. They reward those things, and other
    things as well. </p>
    <p>Participatory economies use three different incentives to
    reward quantity of effort, proficiency of effort, and socially
    useful application of effort, in slightly different
    proportions. There are material rewards for quantity of effort.
    Proficiency of effort is motivated in enterprises by the
    incentives in participatory planning for enterprises to
    increase the ratio of the social benefit of outputs to the
    social cost of inputs (SC/SB), and within enterprises by the interests
    of coworkers and the supervisory system to motivate
    proficiency in each worker because lack of proficiency in one
    requires greater effort from others. Thus, peer pressure from
    those inside and outside one's workplace is important in motivating
    proficiency. Socially useful application in training and work
    effort is primarily motivated in participatory economies by
    social esteem and recognition. I maximize my chance for social
    esteem if I educate and train myself in areas that are my
    comparative advantage and if I orient my efforts toward
    maximizing the social benefit of what I do. </p>
    <p>But it is important to bear in mind who is doing the
    monitoring, rating, and evaluating in a participatory
    economy. My work mates and I decide how our work will be
    monitored. My workmates judge my efforts. And social recognition
    comes from my workmates, other workers in the same federation, and
    from consumers through their consumer federations. It is easy
    to point out that maximizing effort input is not really what
    we want to motivate. Weisskopf is right that we want to maximize
    the social value that results from a given human effort. But
    when we talked of rewarding effort rather than outcome, we meant
    effort expended proficiently to socially useful ends. And in
    a participatory economy that is the only kind of effort it
    makes any sense for one's fellow workers to try and reward in
    either supervision or effort ratings. Why would my fellow
    work mates give me high effort ratings for taking two hours
    longer to mop rooms because I mopped from the door to the far wall
    and had to mop over my foot prints as I left? Why would my
    fellow workers give me high ratings because I worked four
    hours to copyedit a piece because I didn't use the spell
    checker and grammar checker? We think many of the problems
    Weisskopf and Hagar foresee stem from misconstruing what we meant
    by &#147;effort&#148; and disappear in the context of who is doing
    the judging. </p>
    <p>It is also important to keep in mind who is judging, when
    thinking about measurement problems. Of course there are
    problems measuring effort&#151;just as there are problems
    measuring the value of output and attributing that value to
    different people involved. In a participatory economy effort
    rating committees in different workplaces can put as much or
    as little time into measuring effort as they wish. And they
    can collect whatever information they wish&#151;hours worked,
    indications of output, improvement, comparisons with other
    enterprises, self-evaluation, evaluation of team members,
    etc. Nothing is perfect. To the extent they measure
    inaccurately, there will be inequities in effort ratings. But
    we have a hard time believing those inequities would not be considerably
    less than the inequities built into the normal, successful operations
    of &#147;market socialist&#148; or capitalist economies. </p>
    <p>In participatory economies there are both material and
    social incentives, and both kinds of incentives can be used to
    motivate proficient work effort, socially useful training and
    education, and innovation in product design and production
    technique. But 1) every attempt is made to maximize the use
    of peer pressure and social esteem. And 2) there is
    relatively greater reliance on social incentives to motivate
    socially useful education, training, and innovation, and
    relatively greater reliance on material incentives to
    motivate work effort. The reason for the first choice is
    obvious to any parent who has tried to minimize the use of
    allowances to get children to do their chores. The reasons
    for the second choice are: a) Greater material rewards for
    greater sacrifice is equitable, greater material rewards for
    education or innovation is usually not. b) Contributions that
    comes from innovation and education are usually owed to a
    diffuse network of people rather than a single individual. </p>
    <p>We also believe that while those pursuing education in
    more socially valuable careers could be rewarded with greater
    consumption rights as an incentive, it should seldom be
    necessary to do so since 1) the social and personal cost of the
    training is born by society rather than the individual, 2) it is
    not unusual to like to study what you are good at, and 3)
    chances of earning greater social esteem are better if one
    trains in one's comparative advantage. In any case, if someone
    who would have been an excellent surgeon decides not to
    pursue graduate studies, we have no doubt there will be many other
    talented people who will accept admission to medical school. </p>
    <p>Stimulating innovations is somewhat different. Most
    innovations are the result of cumulative human efforts with a good
    deal of luck involved, and this provides good reason for not
    awarding an individual who puts the finishing touch on a
    cumulative advance with substantial material rewards. That is
    why we think efforts to minimize material rewards for
    innovation are warranted, and why we suggest 1) stimulating
    innovation directly through planned expenditures on R&amp;D
    under the management of consumer as well as producer federations,
    and 2) social esteem and recognition for both individuals and enterprises
    that are particularly innovative. But participatory planning
    can award innovative enterprises with job complexes that are
    more desirable than average and/or with consumption
    allowances that are higher than average for specified periods
    of time. And this can be done without retarding the spread of the
    innovation to other enterprises. If the citizens in a participatory
    economy decided in a democratic dialogue that their economy
    was insufficiently dynamic, material incentives such as these
    could be deployed. We think, however, that very few, if any,
    material rewards for innovation would prove necessary, except
    in early phases of a participatory economy, and we believe there
    are good reasons to work particularly hard to hold them to a minimum. </p>

    <h3>Cybernetic Overload</h3>
    <p>Weisskopf says: &#147;Wouldn't the allocation of resources
    in a complex economy by means of participatory decision-making
    institutions place impossible demands on information
    processing and inordinate demands on people's time?&#148;
    (Weisskopf 1992, page 13) </p>
    <p>And he adds: &#147;The mere listing of [the requirements
    for decision-making in a participatory economy] is enough to generate
    skepticism about whether and how they can possibly be met.
    Even if, in principle, institutions and processes can be
    developed to accomplish the necessary tasks (and Albert &amp;
    Hahnel and Devine have advanced some ingenious ideas to do
    so), one is bound to wonder whether the whole system would
    actually function in practice. Assuming that computer
    technology could be relied upon to process and disseminate
    the enormous amount of information needed to make the system work,
    how would people be persuaded to provide the needed information
    in an unbiased and disinterested manner? And even if all the
    needed information could be accurately compiled, wouldn't
    participatory planning require each individual to dedicate so
    much time, interest and energy to assessing the information
    and participating in decision-making meetings that most
    people would get sick and tired of doing it?&#148; (Weisskopf
    1992, page 14-15) </p>
    <p>In defining participatory economic institutions, we paid
    close attention to the incentives for people to provide needed
    information truthfully. It is in the interest of any person
    who wants to win approval for a consumption request or production
    proposal to provide qualitative information explaining why the quantitative
    estimates based on estimated social opportunity costs fail to account
    for some particular circumstances. As to whether people would
    go overboard and exaggerate needs and disabilities, perhaps
    they will. But such accounts are only testimony others will
    review when deciding if exceptions should be granted, and
    presumably people will learn to evaluate such qualitative
    information with a critical eye. Regarding the quantitative information
    and genesis of our indicative prices, we are familiar with
    the literature on incentive compatibility and believe we have designed an incentive
    compatible mechanism. Participatory planning is completely different
    from central planning where individual producers have
    incentives to hide their true capabilities from planning
    authorities. If anyone thinks otherwise, we would appreciate
    a specific criticism, until which time we can only dismiss
    worries such as &#147;how would people be persuaded to
    provide the needed information in an unbiased and
    disinterested manner&#148; as confusing our system with a
    better known but completely different system. </p>
    <p>Weisskopf wonders: &#147;Isn't the process of democratic
    decision-making sufficiently complex and problematic that it
    should be applied only to a limited range of critical
    decision-making areas?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 15) And adds,
    &#147;Isn't the practice of participatory democracy
    sufficiently difficult, time-consuming and emotionally draining
    that it would in practice have to be limited to a relatively
    small range of decisions?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 15) As
    well as: &#147;These kinds of concerns about the operation of
    democratic decision-making processes should not of course be
    read as a condemnation of democracy.... Rather, such concerns
    suggest that democratic political institutions ought to focus
    on a critical and manageable range of decision-making areas,
    rather than be used for all kinds of economic as well as
    political decisions.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 15-16) </p>
    <p>No. This sounds reasonable, at first listening. And it is
    certainly true that we should devote more decision-making time
    to more important decisions and less to less important ones.
    But people should have decision making input in all decisions
    to the degree they are affected. And people, themselves, should decide
    which decisions are of little importance and therefore those
    on which <i>they</i> do not wish to spend much time. In fact,
    many of the decisions that people care a great deal about are
    ones concerning their own neighborhood and workplace&#151;so
    spending time on these issues is not unwarranted. But excluding
    people from a say over long-term national investment plans is
    also undesirable. In participatory economies people are free
    not to attend meetings, or to call for closure, or leave meetings
    early as they desire. But this is not the same as saying some
    issues are too small to warrant democracy, or that some issues
    are too complex and distant for people to decide for themselves.
    Any time a decision is not worth spending any more time over,
    people are free to call a halt to the debate, vote, and move
    on. But democratic decision making is a process that is more
    likely to occur efficiently and with good result the more it
    is practiced wherever people have an interest. </p>
    <p>Weisskopf asks: &#147;Won't the politicization of all
    kinds of decisions lead to excessive conflict, strife, and
    anger?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 15) Market systems are
    clever at disguising exploitation and oppression. Painful consequences
    often seem to be the result of market competition that none
    can forestall, and we are taught that market competition is
    socially beneficial. In market economies the distribution of
    inequity is largely impersonal, which is an important reason
    the inequities have been tolerated so long. Participatory economies,
    in contrast, make every attempt to make the consequences of individual
    and group choices for others as graphic and plain as possible&#151;because
    otherwise people cannot engage in knowledgeable, collective
    self-management. So, we plead guilty to politicizing economic choices,
    but with cause. If you get a low effort rating you will know
    it is because your fellow workers thought that's all you
    deserved. If your enterprise's proposal is not accepted, you
    will know it is because other workers' councils thought it
    was inefficient or too lazy. If your consumption proposal is rejected,
    you will know your neighbors did not think your work effort rating
    merited consuming that much, or that your special needs
    requests were not compelling. However, we do not believe
    participatory economies will lead to the kind of conflict,
    strife, and anger that plague private enterprise and market
    economies. By providing an open, democratic, efficient, and
    fair procedure for negotiating conflicts of interest, we feel
    participatory planning minimizes the probability of strife
    and anger after the plan has been agreed to. </p>
    <p>Folbre complain: &#147;One perverse incentive could be
    labeled `The Dictatorship of the Sociable.' Some people really
    like meetings. They like to talk, to negotiate, to debate. As
    a result, they often attend meetings enthusiastically, and
    they often prevail at them.&#148; (Folbre, 1991, page 69) And
    Weisskopf adds: &#147;In practice such a system might well
    enable some people to exercise much greater influence over
    decisions than others. Disproportionate influence would not
    arise from disproportionate wealth or income, but from
    disproportionate interest in and aptitude for the relevant
    decision-making processes.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 15) </p>
    <p>We should be frank. Long live the dictatorship of the
    sociable if that is the only alternative to the dictatorship
    of the wealthy or the dictatorship of the better
    educated&#151;which is what capitalism and &#147;market
    socialism&#148; come down to. But isn't it ironic that those
    who worry about the dictatorship of the sociable are the same
    people who find balancing job complexes--which is done
    precisely to guarantee equal opportunity to participate
    effectively for all--unjustifiable infringements on personal freedom?
    The purpose of balancing for empowerment is to prevent the
    economic system from generating unequal endowments of what we
    might call &#147;social capital&#148; that effectively disenfranchises
    significant segments of the workforce. Balancing for empowerment
    is the only way to preclude a &#147;Dictatorship of the
    Educated and Managerial,&#148; who needn't be all that
    sociable! </p>
    <p>Folbre adds: &#147;A related problem is the &#147;Let's
    Not Piss Anybody Off&#148; principle.... Many individuals would
    rather accept some decline in collective efficiency rather
    than risk their social reputation as a nice person. Nobody wants
    to be seen as a hard-ass. So discipline is weak. Individuals
    who fail to do what they promised to do are not sanctioned.
    Individuals who always do what they promise to do are ripped
    off.&#148; (Folbre, 1991, page 69) Enterprises in a
    participatory economy that indulge in this kind of
    &#147;liberalism&#148; will have a difficult time achieving
    an acceptable ratio of social benefits of product to social
    costs of inputs. If the hard-working nice people Folbre is so
    concerned about want to carry their irresponsible workmates,
    they may choose to do so rather than struggling with them.
    But participatory planning and effort ratings are
    &#147;incentive compatible&#148; in the sense that people who engage
    in this kind of liberalism &#147;pay a price.&quot; </p>
    <p>We freely admit that most people would spend more time in
    workplace meetings in a participatory economy than a
    hierarchical one. But this is because most people are
    excluded from workplace decision-making in hierarchical economies.
    And we also freely admit that democratic decision-making
    takes more &#147;meeting time&#148; than autocratic decision-making. [Having
    everyone get vacations, not just a few; or having everyone
    get work breaks, not just a few; or having everyone get weekends
    off, not just a few, also reduces output. In all cases the
    issue is whether the lost output is worth it. In any case, we
    should note that decisions arrived at democratically should take
    less time to enforce than ones arrived at autocratically. </p>
    <p>But, we think critics have failed to appreciate an
    important feature of participatory planning when criticizing
    the amount of &#147;meeting time&#148; our &#147;social,
    iterative planning process&#148; would require. For the most
    part people and their delegated representatives do not meet
    face to fact to discuss and negotiate how to coordinate their
    activities, as critics seem to assume. Instead, individuals
    and councils submit proposals for their own activities,
    receive new estimates of social costs, and summit revised
    proposals. Moreover, rather than have delegates from federations
    meet to hammer out the &#147;end game&#148; of the planning
    process, we proposed that after a number of iterations had
    defined the basic contours of the plan, the professsional
    staffs of iteration facilitation boards would define a few feasible
    plans within those contours for constituents to vote on
    without ever meeting and debating. We also did not propose
    face-to-face meetings where different groups plead their
    cases for consumption or production proposals that did not
    meet normal quantitative standards. Instead we proposed that
    councils submit qualitative information as part of their
    proposals, so that higher level federations could grant
    exceptions should they choose to. And the procedure for
    disapproving proposals is a simple up/down vote of federation
    members, rather than a rancorous meeting. </p>

<blockquote>
    <h3>We are Homo Economus Not Homo Socialis</h3>
    <p>Weisskopf worries: &#147;Wouldn't a participatory economic
    system be viable only if there were a prior transformation of
    people's basic consciousness from one that is individually
    oriented to one that is socially oriented?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992,
    page 17) </p>
    <p>And adds: &#147;In order for mechanisms [of participatory
    economics] to add up to a workable system of motivation which
    could substitute for individual material incentives, there
    would surely have to be a wholesale conversion of human
    behavior patterns from homo economus to what might best be characterized
    as homo socialis&#151;i.e. a person whose very consciousness
    was socially rather than individually oriented.&#148;
    (Weisskopf 1992, page 18) </p>
    <p>He argues: &#147;The first issue is whether and how people
    could be expected to change from homo economus, as we know
    him/her in contemporary capitalist societies, to homo
    socialis, as he/she is depicted in the operation of participatory
    socialist societies.... If people act essentially as homo economus, it
    follows that a significant amount of inequality, hierarchy,
    competition, etc. is a necessary ingredient of an efficient
    economic system.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 21) </p>
    <p>Finally: &#147;To transform homo economus into homo
    socialis would thus involve a massive change in people's mind-sets.
    Such a transformation might conceivably be imposed on a
    society by an authoritarian elite, but it is virtually
    impossible to imagine it being generated by a democratic
    process that respected the current attitudes and preferences
    of the general public.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 21-22) </p>
    <p>Concerns such as these&#151;that a participatory economy
    assumes people are altruists, or that a participatory economy
    requires a different set of human motivations than those
    people have currently, and that there is no way to get from
    here to there&#151;are usually the last line of argument
    against pursuing participatory economics as a political
    project. Weisskopf poses the essential dilemma of <i>all</i> fundamental
    social change well when he asks how fundamental human and
    social change can be compatible with democracy. </p>
    <p>We are under no illusions that a democratic economy cannot
    result from a non-democratic political process. Only a social
    movement committed to democracy and justice in all spheres of
    social life, supported &#147;body and soul&#148; by at least
    a third of the population, and approved of by at least
    another third of the population, could possibly establish a
    participatory economy. That means that a third of the
    population would have to be convinced that they wanted an
    economy that was compatible with homo socialis rather than reproductive
    of homo economus. And it means that the solid beginnings of such
    a system of motivation and reward would have to be well
    established during decades of struggle&#151;which places
    important conditions on the internal dynamics such a movement requires.
    But this is precisely the democratic process that can lead to
    a participatory economy. Those who are sufficiently disgusted
    and or oppressed by the results of the economies of greed to
    struggle for a just economy of cooperation and to engage in
    that struggle respecting the principles they are fighting for will
    establish the &#147;living proof&#148; of the possibility and
    advantages of an economy based on those principles. That is also
    presumably how they could win the approval of another third
    of the population. We always assumed a transition could
    require many decades of blood, sweat, and tears with no
    guarantees. But, for us, that is a better prospect than
    another 500 years of solitude, with present results
    guaranteed. </p>
    <p>But notice that the third of the population that is the
    movement for social change does not impose a participatory economy
    on the rest of the population. Only when there is another
    third that votes along with the diehards to take the plunge,
    would a democratically elected government have a mandate to set
    up a participatory economy. </p>
    <p>But when this occurs, there will still be 33 percent of
    the population who neither believe in nor support many of the
    features of a participatory economy. And there will be more
    than 33 percent who are acclimated only to incentives reproductive
    of homo economus. Moreover, few in the 33 percent who have been
    exposed to different incentives via participation in a
    democratic, equitable movement will have both feet firmly in
    the psychological world of the &#147;new man and woman.&#148;
    But we are under no illusions about this either, which is why
    the features of a participatory economy are designed <i>not to assume</i>
    homo socialis, but to work with people who are homo economus,
    and to help transform most of them, over time, into homo
    socialis. </p>
    <p>Unless we are interested in an economy suited only to
    saints, a participatory economy must have mechanisms that <i>pressure</i>
    people to behave in socially responsible ways. The principle
    mechanism that compels workers' and consumers' councils to
    behave in a socially responsible way is peer pressure. Workers'
    councils must demonstrate that their proposals generate an acceptable
    excess of social benefits over social costs. And consumers' councils
    must demonstrate that the social cost of the goods they
    request is consistent with the work effort ratings of their
    members. Ultimately, if self-imposed social responsibility as
    well as peer pressure fail to yield socially responsible behavior,
    a suitably defined majority of other councils imposes an
    acceptable proposal. The principle mechanism that compels individually
    responsible behavior are effort ratings by one's work mates
    and consumption allocations based on effort ratings, as well
    as need. The logic here is to run the economy in a way that
    ensures that even homo economi will behave as homo socialis.
    The idea is that practice makes perfect, not that any of us
    are, or ever will be, 100% homo socialis. We are not surprised
    that people who are drawn to participatory economies have a
    spasmodic, confessional reaction. As one student put it,
    &#147;I believe that people, myself included, want to, on
    some occasions, think only of themselves.&#148; Participatory economies
    are not unmindful of this aspect of the human condition,
    despite what critics have assumed. </p>
    <p>Incidentally, this is why we cannot accept the olive
    branch from &#147;market socialist's&#148; who are kind enough
    to offer it: &#147;Even if one's ultimate hope is to progress
    to a participatory form of socialist society, a gradual move
    to some form of `market socialism,' which would begin to
    change people's actual socioeconomic environment in a more socialist
    direction, would appear to be a necessary first step in
    achieving a democratic transition.&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page
    22) The problem is that the logic of &#147;market
    socialism&#148; is precisely a socioeconomic environment conducive
    to the reproduction of homo economus and the eradication of
    homo socialis! If people have both potentials, and if the principle
    obstacle to a transition to a participatory economy is a long
    history of reinforcing the former and repressing the latter,
    how can an economy that continues to do just that be an
    important part of a transition strategy? True, things would
    be far easier if it could. But to pretend &#147;market
    socialism&#148; will lead to participatory economics seems
    illogical and utopian to us. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Incapable of International Economic Relations</h3>
    <p>One initial criticism of participatory economies was that
    they could not engage in international economic relations
    with other kinds of economies. In the April 1993 issue of <i>Z
    Magazine</i> we gave some tentative suggestions regarding how participatory
    economies might engage in international economic activities:
    We said &#147;we should not be too disapproving if a group of
    historically distinct participatory economies agreed to: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Trade goods and services at terms that were
            beneficial to all, but more beneficial to countries with
            lower levels of consumption per unit of effort </li>
        <li>Share productive knowledge as quickly as possible
            with compensation awarded in some cases, and </li>
        <li>Share unequal stocks of productive resources over a
            reasonable period of time. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>But even so, this must be arranged through democratic
    discussion and planning based on moral argument and informed
    by serious attempts to re-estimate the external costs and
    benefits of economic activities. Otherwise it would still corrode
    economic democracy and equity, as well as continue to destroy
    the planet at an escalating pace.&#148; If a participatory
    economy engages in trade with hierarchical and exploitative
    economies that have higher levels of consumption per unit of
    effort it need only pursue its own advantage in negotiations
    in order to advance the above principles. On the other hand,
    if a participatory economy engaged in trade with less
    materially advanced hierarchical and exploitative economies,
    equity would require the participatory economy to give its international economic
    partners a majority of the mutual benefits. To do otherwise
    would seriously undermine the values and principles necessary
    to the functioning of a participatory economy. </p>
    <p>While critics have not had time to react to our tentative
    suggestions on this score, we find it comforting that the conclusions
    we came to were consistent with the conclusions of the
    Non-Aligned Movement during the debate over a New
    International Economic Order in the North South debate in the
    late 1970s, as well as more recent recommendations from
    progressive circles in the aftermath of NAFTA and GATT. [See
    Jeremy Brecher, &#147;After NAFTA: Global Village or Global
    Pillage?&#148; (<i>Nation</i>, December 6 1993), and Cavanagh,
    Broad and Weiss, &#147;Global New Deal&#148; (<i>Nation</i>,
    December 27 1993).] One additional complication we see for a
    materially advanced participatory economy is what to do if
    the effects of a generous distribution of the benefits of international
    cooperation to an economy that was internally hierarchical
    and exploitative was counter productive to democratic and egalitarian
    reforms within that economy. Our inclination is that
    representatives of the reform movement within the
    exploitative economy should decide if the participatory
    economy should engage in trade with their economy, and if so, on
    what terms. This is analogous to letting the ANC decide when
    other nations should trade with or invest in South Africa as
    long as it pursues apartheid, and on what terms. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The debate so far has clarified some important issues for
    participatory economics. </p>
    <p>First, in theory, equity does not require balancing job
    complexes for desirability as long as differences in desirability
    of work conditions are counterbalanced by unequal consumption
    offset. In other words, if someone wanted to work a more
    desirable job complex and was willing to consume less in
    order to do so, this could, overall, still be equitable. So
    denying people &#147;freedom&#148; to choose to do this, or
    &#147;freedom&#148; to work at a less desirable job complex
    in return for greater consumption privileges, is not required
    by the dictates of justice or the principles of participatory
    economics. But there are important practical obstacles. Most
    important, whether job complexes are balanced for desirability
    or not, they must be balanced for empowerment to protect self-management.
    In reality, however, there is often a significant correlation
    between empowering and desirable tasks. Second, your work mates
    may not want to work less desirable complexes so that you can
    work a more desirable one. In other words, one would have to
    arrange to suit one's preferences in this regard with work
    mates with compatible preferences. It is therefore possible
    this would be one important difference between different workplaces
    one considered in applying for work: some would have job complexes
    balanced for desirability and others would have job complexes
    that were more and less desirable than average, with
    offsetting effort allotments. Of course, real world social
    and technological conditions could also impinge on the degree
    of flexibility in this area. Even so, we see no reason to ban flexibility
    in theory. The essential issue with respect to equity, as
    compared to empowerment, is only that the <i>overall</i>
    burdens and benefits of work <i>and</i> consumption&#151;which
    is to say economic life as a whole&#151;should be balanced for
    everyone in the economy. </p>
    <p>Second, there are, in fact, some complications that arise
    if we succeed in rewarding sacrifice, or effort, and do not
    materially reward talent. For example, imagine a world with
    capitalist economies, &#147;market socialist&#148; economies,
    and participatory economies all existing side-by-side. If
    there were people in the participatory economy who owned a
    greater than proportionate share of the physically productive
    assets in the economy, there would be an incentive for them
    to emigrate with the capital they own to a capitalist
    economy. But, of course, nobody owns the physically
    productive assets in participatory economies, and trying to
    emigrate with state property would obviously be theft. However,
    there would be particularly talented people in participatory economies,
    as there are in all economies. And there would be people who
    had received substantial amounts of education at social, rather
    than personal expense. And in each of these cases there would
    therefore exist a material incentive to emigrate to
    &#147;market socialist&#148; economies where they would
    receive greater material reward for the contribution their
    talent or education permits them to make. If there is no
    respect and esteem for talent and expertise in the
    participatory economy, if self-management, equity, and solidarity
    are not forthcoming, and if people do not come to see talent
    and socially costly education as a &#147;gift&#148; that
    confers an obligation to benefit less fortunate citizens who
    are engaging in equal or greater sacrifices&#151;then the material
    advantages of emigration may become weighty. We support the &#147;Cuban&#148;
    rather than the &#147;Russian&#148; policy response. The
    Cuban government always said &#147;good riddance to bad
    rubbish&#151;goodbye gusano.&#148; Soviet policy was often to
    restrict emigration of the more highly talented or educated.
    A logical case could be made for requiring people to pay back
    the cost of their greater education that was paid for at
    public expense, but the implication of keeping people
    &#147;captive&#148; who want to leave is unacceptable, in our
    view. In any case, a participatory economy with a strong net
    out migration, or an emigration/immigration pattern that
    produced a strong brain drain, is not a participatory economy
    that deserves to withstand the test of time. We would never
    defend a system that had to put up fences to keep people in.
    But we remain confident that those who would leave to exploit
    their talent or education elsewhere would be more than
    adequately replaced from the pool of talent and education
    remaining. </p>
    <p>We should note, also, that there is an analogous problem
    that could lead to black markets in a participatory. That is,
    in activities without economies of scale, highly talented or
    educated individuals could strike mutually beneficial deals
    with consumers outside the &#147;formal&#148; participatory economy.
    Instead of working in an official workplace where they would
    be paid only according the their effort, they could make the
    product and sell it on the black market for a price under the
    social opportunity cost&#151;the benefit to the
    buyer&#151;but high enough to compensate the producer more
    than they would have received for doing the same work at
    their official work site, since the &#147;market would bear&#148; a
    price reflecting their effort and greater than average talent
    or training. What would minimize this problem&#151;and it is
    a problem because it leads to inequities and undermines the
    system of incentives participatory economies rely on&#151;are
    the considerable economies of scale in production of most
    goods and services, and popular consciousness that would see
    this activity as &#147;cheating&#148; rather than
    &#147;fair.&#148; Also, to the extent that material rewards
    were less important and social rewards more important in
    achieving esteem, such activity by talented and educated
    people would be counterproductive. </p>
    <p>Third, Weisskopf says: &#147;Advocates of participatory
    planning...tend to ignore the myriad problems involved in establishing
    fair and efficient democratic decision-making processes.
    First of all, choice among alternative voting conventions is
    complex and critical: when should decisions be made by simple
    majority, by a super majority, or by consensus? What will
    distinguish constitutionally protected rights from those
    subject to democratic voting?&#148; (Weisskopf 1992, page 15)
    This point is well taken. We have engaged in a degree of hand
    waving regarding the exact procedures for approving and disapproving
    proposals in participatory planning. We continue to believe
    the general principles are correct&#151;that only when
    councils can demonstrate that their proposals are socially beneficial
    and responsible is there reason for others to approve them.
    But no doubt disagreements will arise, and the modern game
    theoretic literature regarding voting coalitions does have contributions to
    make in this area that require further exploration. Moreover,
    as we acknowledged earlier, constitutional rights that
    supersede majority rule are important issues in any society
    and economy, including a participatory economy. We agree that
    more work needs to be done in this area, as well as distinguishing
    between people who feel themselves (and are) affected by a decision another
    would take, but who we may decide have no legitimate right to
    influence the decision. A majority of most American
    communities we lived in would have liked to cut our long hair
    in the late 1960s since it really galled them. But that
    doesn't mean that the principle of self-management gives them the
    right to do it! </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>But as we have said elsewhere: &#147;Ultimately, the
    social process of consciously, democratically, and equitably coordinating
    our interconnected economic activities is fundamentally
    different from the social process of competing against one
    another in the exchange of goods and services. And while both
    `solutions' to the economic problem are feasible, only the
    former is compatible with self-management (decision making
    input in proportion to the degree one is affected by the
    outcome), equity (to each according to personal sacrifice or
    effort), solidarity (concern for the well being of others),
    variety, and efficiency (maximizing the social benefits
    resulting from the use of scarce productive resources), not
    to speak of ecological sustainability.&#148; (Albert and Hahnel,
    1992b, page 131) And that is why we need participatory
    planning, rather than markets. </p>

the Nation Magazine or the Wilderness Society, or another non-profit, periodical, union, or other 
constituency based organization, gets...</p>
<p>&#160;&#160;</p>
<h3>Key Benefits of ShareWorld Systems for clients compared to having only 
a robust web site:</h3>
<dl>
<dd><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="[Bullet]" align=bottom width=14 height=14> Much greater functionality, allowing tighter ties with your constituency, greater gains from 
interactivity, etc.</dd>
<dd><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="[Bullet]" align=bottom width=14 height=14> Increased identification and connection within your community</dd>
<dd><img src="images/bullet.gif" alt="[Bullet]" align=bottom width=14 height=14> A revenue stream to help finance your public site and your other projects, as well</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="Costs to Clients and Client Responsibilities">Costs to Clients and Client Responsibilities</a></h2>
<p>When an organization decides to contract for a ShareWorld online system it does take on some 
responsibility for the resuling facility. While ShareWorld provides all the technical tools and the 
maintanence, tech support, online and phone help, etc., and passes along revenues, the client has 
two primary responsibilities, and a variety of additional options.</p>
<p>First, the client has to agree to help ShareWorld promote the new system by (1) running ads or 
descriptive articles in client literature, (2) including reference to the system in client promotional 
mailings, and (3) providing ShareWorld the client's constituency list for both mailings and phone 
solicitation for the client's new online system. </p>
<p>And second, the client needs to oversee the design and definition of the system, being sure that it fits 
the client's needs and specifications and also to help provide content for the system particularly 
rooted in the client organization's services, agenda, and social involvements. </p>
<p>Beyond this, clients are also free to use ShareWorld Systems to create organizational tools for their 
staff's private use, to participate to greater extents in forums, courses, in other ShareWorld 
offerings, in providing information for the system, and so on.</p>

<h2>ShareWorld Internet</h2>
<p>Of course all ShareWorld on line systems are tightly integrated with the whole internet. Users can easily 
browse the web, use telnet or ftp, and use more sophisticated tools as well. Users with internet accounts 
elsewhere that they wish to maintain can telnet into ShareWorld Systems. Other users can use their 
ShareWorld System account, with Left On Line, say, or Nation On Line, as their internet provider as well 
as for its own unique features. </p>
<p>Here, then, is the typical ShareWorld system menu for using the Internet... (We supply MS. Explorer on 
installation disks, because it is available free and with minor contractual terms. We also provide easy 
download and installation of Netscape, however.)</p>
<p><img src="images/serv014.gif" align=bottom width=513 height=486></p>
<p>And here is a second related window...</p>
<p><img src="images/SWinet8.gif" align=bottom width=544 height=486></p>
<p>Browsing is done with Microsoft Explorer, which ShareWorld provides, or Netscape, which our users 
can easily download. There is no installation complexity...it is all automatic.</p>
<p><img src="images/div.gif" alt="[HRule Image]" align=bottom width=465 height=7> </p>
<h2>What about A Web Site?</h2>
<p>ShareWorld's clients all have web sites, of course, and these both promote and also provide a jumping 
off access point to their more robust On Line Systems. </p>
<p>But even beyond this, users of ShareWorld created online systems have the option to create their own 
personal web sites and to maintain them through such systems -- Wilderness On Line, Nation on Line, Left 
on Line, and so on. Setting up and updating sites is easy, and the sites are housed in our large and very 
fast systems. This facet of our operations is under construction, but should be ready for use in a matter of 
weeks.</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Joining LOL involves no initial fee. When you join you get
    3 free hours or fifteen days, whichever comes first, to
    explore the system and its offerings. At that point, and only
    at that point, we begin charging you the monthly fee. You can
    quit, from online, any time.</p>
    <p>And there is only one monthly fee, simple but inflexible. </p>
    <p>For your membership you pay $8 a month and get unlimited
    access via your web browser (and our plug in modules) to LOL
    options including online articles, search facilities, forums,
    polling, calendars, web guidance, games, email, and so on. </p>
    <p>It doesn't matter how much you use the system, how much
    email you do, how many forum messages you read or write, how
    much you listen to or contribute, or view, within the LOL
    system and the broader ShareWorld community of systems. It is
    $8 a month, period.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>&nbsp;</dt>

</blockquote>

<h2>Join From Online</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>To join from online just navigate to the <a
    href="http://www.lol.shareworld.com/leftonl/lolentry.htm"
    target="_top">Left On Line Vistors</a> page, and from there
    peruse the availabilities, and then, if you decide you want
    to join, select the join option and enter your information.</p>

<h2>ShareWorld E-Mail</h2>
<p>E-Mail is arguably the most important single function on any telecommunications system. ShareWorld offers a number of 
approachs to E-Mail one of which we will describe here. It of course connects to everyone on a given ShareWorld system, such 
as Nation On Line, and to everyone in the whole community of ShareWorld systems, but it also connect seamlessly with all other 
internet addresses.</p>
<p>And the system is robust and functional, including the ability to format messages by font type, size, and color, paragraph and line 
settings, and so on. There is spell checking, file cabinets, etc. And, of course, there is excellent offline capability so that you never 
have to read or write while you are on the phone.</p>
<p>Here, then, are some of the relevant windows from the E-Mail facility. First, the message center window, also used for forums.</p>
<p><img src="images/SWemai1.gif" align=bottom width=636 height=274></p>
<p>Then we have the window that pops up to take addresses, etc.</p>
<p><img src="images/SWemai2.gif" align=bottom width=547 height=440></p>
<p>And the window where one writes a message...</p>

<h2>ShareWorld Community</h2>
<p>One of our priority aims regarding ShareWorld Systems is that they be non-alienating, congenial, 
supportive communities for people to enjoy and benefit from.</p>
<p>This is, in the telecommunications world, a tall order.</p>
<p>Most online systems are replete with impediments to community. On the one hand there is intense 
commercialism. Systems are oriented to make a buck, at any cost and users can feel and see this, and the 
prospects for open and understanding exchange suffers.</p>
<p>Also, however, there are problems that arise from users themselves. Systems are fraught with uncivil 
behavior, flaming, harassment of women, etc.</p>
<p>On ShareWorld systems we eliminate these ills and then some. </p>
<p>There is no crass commercialism. Sponsors can sell things like subscriptions or items they promote, and 
there is even an online mall for shopping -- but only socially responsible businesses are welcome, and, 
more to the point, users have to choose to see these offerings. They are not flaunted at every opportunity.</p>
<p>We incorporate various forums devoted to humor, making friends and learning about one another, etc.</p>
<p>We have a system registry for people to enter information in. You double lick on a user id and see the 
personal information they have entered as their online bio...</p>
<p><img src="images/SWcom23.gif" align=bottom width=524 height=363></p>
<p>We have a facility for developing &quot;pen pal&quot; and &quot;buddy&quot; relationships online.</p>
<p><img src="images/SWcom24.gif" align=bottom width=527 height=503></p>
<p>And, all public exchanges are moderated according to our online rules of operations...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For everyone's safety, no socially illegal actions are permitted, nor will any be tolerated. 
This is a social statement of collective norms of survival for a progressive online system.<br>
<br>
Also, beyond society's limitations, incivility in any form is forbidden on any ShareWorld 
system. This is a moderated system and we intend to ensure that users enjoy a congenial, 
friendly, and respectful environment. In particular, any kind of harassment is forbidden, 
including overt sexism, racism, or classism, of course, but also including any kind of 
demeaning or otherwise hostile disrespect of others. <br>
<br>
Also forbidden is hounding others in any way, even for perfectly respectful ends, such as 
continually emailing or publicly posting messages trying to engage or to continue exchanges 
with folks who have clearly indicated (publicly or privately) their desire to leave an 
exchange.<br>
<br>
Likewise, questioning ideas and claims and offering varied views on matters is of course 
wonderful. But questioning user's private motivations is not.<br>
<br>
Finally, referring in public posts to the views that other people on the system hold without 
incorporating quotes from the people that do in fact make those points, is also frowned upon. <br>
<br>
But, everything not forbidden is welcome. <br>
<br>

Reflections on Human Nature and the Social Order</H2>
<H3>By Noam Chomsky</H3>
<P>In this wide-ranging intellectual tour de force, Noam Chomsky  brings
together his thoughts on topics ranging from language and human nature, to the
Middle East settlement and the role of East Timor in the New World Order. This
is the first collection of his essays in recent years to bring together
questions of philosophy, ethics, and foreign policy, and he includes his first
published remarks on political goals and visions.   </P>
<P>This book will be of great interest to both the general reader who is new to
Chomsky's political and linguistic work, and the avid Chomsky reader who will
discover new writing on current topics. It includes concise essays that explain
Chomsky's philosophical approach to linguistics and offer a short history of the
study of language; describe the role of the &quot;cognitive revolution&quot; in
linguistics; and explore the way scientific questions are asked, answered, and
influenced by dominant ways of thinking.  Essays on the intellectual
responsibilities of writers and on Chomsky's own political goals and visions
provide a bridge from his chapters on human nature to four strong pieces on
issues in international affairs.</P>
<P>Whether he is looking at the Middle East, the relationship of Democracy and
markets in the New World Order, or human rights violations in East Timor,
Chomsky draws links between foreign policy decisions, the state of intellectual
culture, the role of the media, and the potential for free and democratic
societies to understand and counter the heinous acts being committed in their
name. Chomsky's refreshingly clear views of the world and the nature of things
are supported by a wealth of detail.</P>
<P><I>A world renowned linguist and outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy
and the mass media, Noam Chomsky has served as Institute Professor of the
Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT. According to the Arts and
Humanities Citation Index, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any
other living scholar between 1980 and 1992. He has published nine books with
South End Press.</I></P>

Emerging Social Justice Movements in Communities of Color</H2>
<H3>Edited by John Anner</H3>
<P>Beyond Identity Politics: Emerging Social Justice Movements in Communities
of Color provides a long-awaited roadmap to the grassroots social justice
movements of the 1990s and beyond. 
</P>
<P>Rapidly changing urban demographics, downsized government programs, and
economic globalization require new social justice strategies and new organizing
methods that go beyond identity politics. This anthology of new and previously
published essays describes how organizers are building sophisticated, successful
multiracial political organizations in low-income communities and communities of
color. With their vitality, complexity, and fluidity, these new political
formations are, in fact, transcending the politics of identity and redefining
the very meaning of the phrase of &quot;community organizing.&quot;
</P>
<P>Culled from Third Force magazine, which is &quot;charting a new course for
leftist journalism&quot; according to Utne Reader, Beyond Identity Politics
describes a strikingly diverse array of struggles: Korean workers fighting both
Korean business owners and anti-Asian prejudice, Latinos creatively organizing
communities on both sides of the border, a national campaign based in inner
cities combining police accountability with crime prevention, Native Americans
forming a powerful anti-toxics network, artists and community organizers joining
forces to stop violent images of Asian women, and much more.
</P>
<P>According to Third Force editor John Anner, the face of activism in the next
century will be more democratic, more gender-balanced, more gay-positive, more
multi-lingual and more multicultural--effectively fusing the politics of
interest with the politics of identity. In an era when the right wing seems to
be winning all battles, Beyond Identity Politics presents a critical inside look
at progressive victories.
</P>
<P><I>John Anner is editor of Third Force magazine.</I></P>

Women's Poverty in the United States</H2>
<H3>Edited by Diane Dujon and Ann Withorn</H3>
<P>Welfare reform is once again on the national agenda, and as the debate
unfolds, it is very important to keep the needs of women and children, the
fastest growing population of those in poverty, central to the debate. For
Crying Out Loud challenges the ways that the assault on welfare places blame on
women's shoulders, and ultimately judges all women for the failures of the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>This anthology shows that the situation facing poor women continues to
deteriorate and that their concerns are often denied and misunderstood by
politicians, policy makers, and the media. Although many believe that government
expenditures for the poor are running rampant, in reality only one of every
eight dollares of federal entitlement outlays goes to those living in poverty.
In fact, the rich are subsidized by the government at a greater level than the
poor.</P>
<P>For Crying Out Loud, through the multiplicity of voices addresses  the
complex reasons that women find themselves poor, and the richness of their
efforts to transcend their adversity. This collection trys to move the focus of
the debate away form eliminating welfare to eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>The writers in this anthology begin to unsnarl the tangled skeins of women's
poverty and weave a richer tapestry, one that presents a vivid picture of
economic, social, and psychological dimensions of economic deprivation. Neither
a laundry list of woes nor a detached academic survey, For Crying Out Loud
combines powerful personal accounts with systematic analysis to present a broad
view, one that includes single mothers, aging widows, black women, Latinas, and
rural women, in a wide-range lens.
</P>
<P>This collection does more than catalog women's strengths and the
difficulties of poverty: its authors review &quot;traditional solutions&quot; to
women's poverty, such as job programs, welfare, and electoral politics, with an
urge to see beyond them to more fundamental change. For Crying Out Loud brings
together a diverse group of authors, including well-known writers and activists
such as Mimi Abramovitz, Frances Fox Piven, and Marian Kramer. 
</P>
<P><I>Diane Dujon is a longtime welfare rights organizer, writer, and former
welfare recipient. Dujon is an administrator at the College of Public and
Community Service at the University of Massachusetts/ Boston. She has worked on
the National Up and Out of Poverty campaigns and is involved with Boston Jobs
for Peace, the Women's Institute for New Growth and Support, and Survival News.</I></P>

Confronting the Prison Crisis</H2>
<H3>Edited by Elihu Rosenblatt</H3>
<P>Politicians and the mass media have recently ushered in an enormous wave of
fear about violent crime. Meanwhile, the reality of the criminal prosecution
system remains carefully hidden from public understanding by the same
individuals and institutions in big business and government who manufacture
consent and engineer mass culture. 
</P>
<P>This remarkable anthology, edited by the coordinator of the Prison Activist
Resource Center (PARC), takes the discussion of crime out of the realm of false
debate fostered by an increasingly conservative and punitive state, and exposes
the economic and political realities behind the imprisonment of astounding
numbers of the working class, working poor, and people of color. 
</P>
<P>
The popular obsession with crime serves as a smokescreen to divert our attention
and energies from confronting the underlying causes for increasing violence in
our society. Criminal Injustice argues that we must counter the mythology of
crime hype by exposing and educating against the real dangers people face, such
as poverty, police abuse, and domestic violence.
</P>
<P>As thorough as it is insightful, this book examines issues ranging from the
role of prisons in the repression of activists to the health crisis behind bars.
It discusses women in prison, the death penalty, the rise of maximum security
control units, and political prisoners and prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>The contributors are articulate commentators on U.S. social, political, and
economic realities who provide important statistics and cogent analyses which
are accessible to the general reader and essential to scholars and activists.
</P>
<P>Prisons can be seen as a barometer for all that is ill at the core of our
society. Thus, academics in the fields of Sociology, African-American Studies,
or Political Science, as well as organizers working around issues as diverse as
environmental justice, housing, or reproductive rights will find this tremendous
resource indispensable in informing, inspiring, and providing direction for
action.

<H3>By Roy Morrison</H3>
<P>&quot;This book is about building better lives, creating and nurturing
ecological communities; transforming the world...It is the adventure of family,
of pleasure, of rediscovering our lives. Come walk and climb and sit quietly
with me.&quot; -Roy Morrison, from the preface to Ecological Democracy</P>
<P>In this provocative, creative, and relevatory work, Roy Morrison explains in
practical and theoretical terms how to build an ecological democracy. Morrison's
heartening description of community-based democratic social practice offers a
realistic alternative to Newt Gingrich's right-wing nightmares and Bill
Clinton's neo-liberal dreams.</P>
<P>Offering a broad-based critique of industrialism, Morrison explores
currently emerging ecological democracies, such as the Mondragon Cooperative
system in Spain, the Seikatsu Cooperative Clubs in Japan, and Coop Atlantic in
Canada. He outlines a dramatically revitalized participatory democracy--which
includes community control of finances, a social wage, cooperative economies,
demilitarization, and a solar transition--and shows how to get there from here.</P>
<P>Written from the perspective of a longtime peace and antinuclear activist,
Ecological Democracy is an essential book not only for those concerned with
society's industrial crisis, but for those who want to build a just and
sustainable future.</P>
<P><I>Roy Morrison, a longtime peace and antinuclear activist, is the author
of We Build the Road as We Travel: Mondragon, A Cooperative Social System. He
lives in Warner, New Hampshire.</I></P>

<H2>Dangerous Crossroads</H2>
<H3>By the North American Congress on Latin America</H3>
<P>
This book--the first to analyze Haiti after the U.S. occupation--gives us the
background and context we need to understand the ongoing crisis in the current
post-Cold War hot spot. <I>Haiti: Dangerous Crossroad</I>s is a succinct
history and up-to-date analysis of the tragic betrayal of Haitian democracy.
Starting with the 19th century War of Independence, through the Duvalier
dynasty, the election of Aristide, the coup, and the current intervention, this
volume traces Haiti's tireless efforts to bring about democracy--and the equally
tireless efforts of those determined to squash it.</P>
<P><I>Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</I> gathers together the most reliable
information and most comprehensive analysis of Haiti that the U.S. Left has to
offer. The Haitian crisis has its roots in colonial times, came of age in the
era of gun-boat diplomacy, and exemplified Cold War policy. Its denouement today
is paradigmatic of the &quot;new world order.&quot; It is therefore essential
reading not only for those wanting to gain a deeper understanding of Haiti, but
also for anyone trying to grasp the complexities of post Cold War geopolitics.</P>
<P>NACLA is an independent, non-profit research organization founded in 1966.
The bimonthly <I>NACLA Report on the Americas</I> is the most widely read
English-language magazine on Latin America and the Caribbean. The editors of
<I>Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</I> are Mark Fried, Pierre LaRamee, Deidre
McFadyen, and Fred Rosen.</P>

<H1>Chaos or Community </H1>
<HR>
<H2>Seeking Solutions, Not Scapegoats to Bad Economics</H2>
<H3>By Holly Sklar</H3>
<P>Americans are angry and confused about the state of the economy. The choice
is increasingly a dead-end job or no job, whether the economy is &quot;strong&quot;
or in recession. Wages are way down for younger generations. Once thriving
communities are in decline. Like no other book, <I></I> clears up the confusion
and offers urgent solutions. It has a uniquely sweeping grasp of national and
international economic trends, and how their social and political implications
are felt by the person on the street.</P>
<P>Sklar tells how blame for illegitimate economics is deflected with racist
and sexist scapegoating.  The shrinking American middle class is misled into
thinking those below them on the economic ladder are pulling them down. People
who should be working together to transform harmful economic policies are
instead turning on each other. The &quot;War on Poverty&quot; has given way to
the rollback of welfare. Millions of young people are being written off. Instead
of full employment, the United States has full prisons. The military budget
continues waging the Cold War, while needed programs to prevent violence and
invest in people are being sacrificed. Echoing Martin Luther King's eloquent
appeal to choose community over chaos before it's too late, Sklar offers crucial
steps for changing course, protecting livelihoods, and forging true security and
opportunity.</P>
<P>Holly Sklar's previous works include <I>Streets of Hope: The Fall and Rise
of an Urban Neighborhood</I> (co-authored) and
<I>Trilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning for World
Management</I>, the far-reaching book that foretold the New World Order. She is
a columnist for <I>Z</I> Magazine and has contributed to numerous books and
periodicals, including <I>The Nation,</I> the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> and
<I>USA Today</I>.</P>

<H1>Leasing the Ivory Tower</H1>   
<IMG SRC="lease2.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE">
<H2>The Corporate Takeover of Academia</H2>
<H3>By Lawrence C. Soley</H3>
<P>While a few incidents of &quot;political correctness&quot; have received
lavish attention from the mass media, the corporate buyout of academia has gone
nearly unnoticed.  In <I>Leasing the Ivory Tower,</I> Soley exhaustively
documents how corporations, the military, and right-wing foundations have
quietly seized control of our institutions of higher learning. While the news
media have diverted public attention with exaggerated claims of a leftist
takeover of the university, financially strained colleges and universities
working in service of corporations, Soley argues, have dealt a massive betrayal
to the students and taxpayers who pick up the bill. </P>
<P>Award winning writer Lawrence Soley gives the dirty details on campuses
nationwide, including Columbia, Yale, Harvard, MIT, Michigan State, Johns
Hopkins, University of Arizona, Catholic University, Brigham Young, and
University of California. Impassioned, outraged, and meticulously documented,
<I>Leasing the Ivory Tower</I>  exposes the growing corporate threats to the
future of intellectual inquiry and civil society itself.</P>
<P>Lawrence C. Soley has taught at the University of Alabama, University of
Georgia, Penn State, and the City University of New York.  He currently teaches
at Marquette University in Milwaukee.  Soley's previous books include The <I>News
Shapers </I>(Praeger, 1992),<I>
 Radio Warfare</I> (Praeger, 1989), and
<I>Clandestine Radio Broadcasting</I> (Praeger, 1987), which was selected as
one of the &quot;outstanding&quot; books of 1987 by Choice magazine.  With
Village Voice reporter Marc Cooper, Soley received the prestigious Sigma Delta
Chi Award for a Mother Jones article about the small group of &quot;experts&quot;
repeatedly quoted by television news reporters.  In 1993, Soley and former
Marquette University professor Bob Craig received the American Academy of
Advertising's &quot;Best Article Award&quot; for a research report titled &quot;Advertising
Pressures on Newspapers.&quot; </P>

<P><I>Noam Chomsky</I></P>
<P>With chapters on Haiti, Latin America, the new global economic order, the
Third World at home, and much more, this is a powerful treatise on the
not-so-new world order. &quot;Year 501 is another awesome achievement by Noam
Chomsky. It is a devastating array of information about the U.S. role in the
world, placed in the long historical perspective of 500 years that followed the
voyages of Columbus. The result is a wonderful single-volume education in
history and world politics.&quot; &#151;Howard Zinn</P>

<H3><A NAME="rethinkingcamelot">Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietname War, and
U.S. Political Culture</A></H3>
<P><I>Noam Chomsky</I></P>
<P>&quot;This book is a thorough analysis of John F. Kennedy's role in the U.S.
invasion of Vietnam and a probing reflection of the elite political culture that
allowed and encouraged the Cold War. Particularly important is his careful
delineation of the debate over whether Kennedy was about to withdraw from
Vietnam, a decision (some argue) aborted by his assassination in November 1963,
and Chomsky's analysis of the gulf between the general public and policy-making
elites. His larger argument is that Vietnam is just one more phase in the
European conquest that began 501 years ago. &#133; An interesting work not only
for the history it explores, but also as a study of how various individuals and
groups write and interpret history.&quot; &#151;Choice</P>

<P><I>Mab Segrest</I></P>
<P>Against the backdrop of the rampaging Far Right movement of the 1980s,
southern activist Mab Segrest probes the complex intersections of racism,
misogyny, homophobia, and capitalism. In these new essays and narratives that
are grounded in two decades of feminist, gay/lesbian, and anti-racist activism,
she moves from reporting to personal reflection to historical analysis in order
to focus on the primacy of racism in shaping U.S. history and its constant
complication by forces of gender and sexuality.  The book autobiographically
explores the history of  &quot;white&quot; consciousness in the United States,
the Civil Rights Movement, Southern culture,  neo-Nazis and the Klan, and
lesbian-feminism.</P>

Crossroads: The Restructuring of Black Leadership and the 1992 Elections</A></H3>
<P><I>Clarence Lusane</I></P>
<P>Although liberalism still remains the dominant political ideology of the
black leadership elite, new political trends have emerged in the Black community
that challenge and critique the traditional liberalism of the Democratic party
as well as the neo-conservatism of the Republican party. Lusane uses the 1992
elections as a prism to explore Black community leadership and offers a

<P><I>By William W. Sales</I></P>
<P>From Civil Rights to Black Liberation is one of the few books that offers
historical research about the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), a
revolutionary organization founded by Malcolm X and rooted in traditions of
black nationalism, self-determination, and human rights.  The author establishes
the relevance of Malcolm's political legacy for the task of rebuilding the
movement for Black liberation almost thirty years after his assassination. Sales
intelligently argues why he considers Malcolm X more than an icon for
revolutionary African American youth; he asserts that he was a &quot;multi-faceted
thinker and organizer who is worthy of serious study by scholars, activists, and
anyone looking to understand our world today.&quot; &#151;Publishers Weekly</P>

<P><I>Noam Chomsky</I></P>
<P>With chapters on Haiti, Latin America, the new global economic order, the
Third World at home, and much more, this is a powerful treatise on the
not-so-new world order. &quot;Year 501 is another awesome achievement by Noam
Chomsky. It is a devastating array of information about the U.S. role in the
world, placed in the long historical perspective of 500 years that followed the
voyages of Columbus. The result is a wonderful single-volume education in
history and world politics.&quot; &#151;Howard Zinn</P>

<P><I>Noam Chomsky</I></P>
<P>&quot;This book is a thorough analysis of John F. Kennedy's role in the U.S.
invasion of Vietnam and a probing reflection of the elite political culture that
allowed and encouraged the Cold War. Particularly important is his careful
delineation of the debate over whether Kennedy was about to withdraw from
Vietnam, a decision (some argue) aborted by his assassination in November 1963,
and Chomsky's analysis of the gulf between the general public and policy-making
elites. His larger argument is that Vietnam is just one more phase in the
European conquest that began 501 years ago. &#133; An interesting work not only
for the history it explores, but also as a study of how various individuals and
groups write and interpret history.&quot; &#151;Choice</P>

explores the history of  &quot;white&quot; consciousness in the United States,
the Civil Rights Movement, Southern culture,  neo-Nazis and the Klan, and
lesbian-feminism.</P>

<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Chaos or Community?</H1>
<H2>By Holly Sklar</H2>
<P>The American Dream&#151;always an impossible dream for many&#151;is dying a
slow death. As the systemic causes go untreated, a host of local and national
leaders are peddling the snake oil of scapegoating. We don't have to swallow it.
Together, we can find real remedies to our common problems.</P>
<P>Three decades ago, in Where Do We Go From Here, Martin Luther King spoke
prophetically about polarizing national and international trends. He urged us to
choose community over chaos:</P>
<P>&quot;A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring
contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look at
thousands of working people displaced from their jobs with reduced incomes as a
result of automation while the profits of the employers remain intact, and say &quot;This
is not just.</P>
<P>&quot;We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today&#133;We still
have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. This may
well be mankind's last chance to choose between chaos and community.&quot;</P>
<P>In the last three decades, humankind has taken giant steps toward community&#151;and
chaos. The Cold War threat of coannihilation has faded, but many nations are
wracked by internal conflict. The United States grows increasingly disunited.
The ruinous social and economic trends that King warned us about have
intensified. Wealth is not trickling down. It is flooding upward. Real wages for
average workers have plummeted&#151;despite rising productivity. Many corporate
executives make more in a week than their workers make in a year. Unemployment
is high whether the economy is in recession or &quot;recovery.&quot; The &quot;War
on Poverty&quot; has given way to the escalating war on the poor. Once-thriving
communities are in decline.</P>
<P>Economic inequality is now so extreme that the wealthiest 1 percent of
American families have nearly as much as the entire bottom 95 percent. More than
a fifth of all children are living in poverty in this, the world's richest
nation. That's according to the government, which undercounts both poverty and
unemployment. Downward mobility has become the legacy for younger generations.
Neither two incomes, nor college degrees assure that younger families will ever
match their parents' living standards.</P>
<P>For more and more people, a job is not a ticket out of poverty, but into the
ranks of the working poor. Jobs and wages are being downsized in the &quot;leaner,
meaner&quot; world of global corporate restructuring. Corporations are
aggressively automating and shifting operations among cities, states and nations
in a continual search for greater public subsidies and lower-cost labor.
Full-time jobs are becoming scarcer as corporations shape a cheaper, more
disposable workforce of temporary workers, part-timers and other &quot;contingent
workers.&quot;</P>
<P>Workers are increasingly expected to migrate from job to job, at low and
variable wage rates, without paid vacation, much less a pension. How can they
care for themselves and their families, maintain a home, pay for college, save
for retirement, plan a future? How do we build strong communities? What about
the millions of people without jobs? This brand of economics is a prescription
for chaos.</P>
<P>The cycle of unequal opportunity is intensifying. Its beneficiaries often
slander those most systematically undervalued, underpaid, underemployed,
underfinanced, underinsured, underrated and otherwise underserved and undermined&#151;as
undeserving and underclass, impoverished in moral values and lacking the proper
&quot;work ethic.&quot; The angry, shrinking middle class is misled into
thinking that those lower on the economic ladder are pulling them down, when in
reality those on top are rising at the expense of those below. People who should
be working together to transform the economic policies that are hurting them are
instead turning hatefully on each other.</P>
<P>Instead of full employment, the United States has full prisons. It imprisons
Black men at a much higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid. The
military budget continues consuming resources at Cold War levels, while programs
to prevent violence and invest in people, infrastructure and the environment are
sacrificed on the altar of deficit reduction.</P>
<P>
Instead of dedicating itself to equal opportunity for children, society is
living a self-fulfilling prophecy: labeling more children as illegitimate,
expecting more children to fail, and declaring more children the enemy. A
society which sees a great number of its children as hopeless, is a society
without hope for the future.</P>
<P>To realize community over chaos we must revitalize democracy with plain talk
about who really benefits and who loses from government policy. We need vigorous
debate over how to reshape policy in the public interest&#151;not the pseudo
debate of false campaign promises, negative political ads and talk radio
hate-mongering.</P>
<P>Rights and &quot;entitlements&quot; taken for granted today&#151;among them
the eight-hour day, minimum wage, Social Security and the right of workers to
organize and bargain collectively&#151;were obtained in the face of strong
opposition. Many of these achievements are being eroded. Demagoguery is
threatening democracy. To realize community over chaos we must not only protect
old gains, but forge new social, political and economic rights for the 21st
century.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>FBI Secrets Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from FBI Secrets</H1>
<H2>BY M. Wesley Swearingen</H2>
<P>I became a Special Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in
1951. I did not know, when I joined, that I would learn the expertise of
burglary, or that former Director J. Edgar Hoover would instruct agents to
violate extortion and kidnapping laws. I did not know then that FBI agents would
plot assassinations of American citizens and put innocent individuals in jail
just because their skin is black or because they are Native Americans.</P>
<P>I retired in May 1977, completely disillusioned after more than twenty-five
years of service. I suffered through over a year of sleepless nights, countless
nightmares, and tortured conversations with family and friends before I took the
irreversible step of publicly condemning an organization I once had loved and
respected. </P>
<P>Because of the FBI's widespread dishonesty and corruption, by the end of my
tenure there I had lost the ability to distinguish between different levels of
corruption. In the beginning, when I saw new agents being encouraged to cheat on
their examinations, I was shocked. But after twenty years of seeing a whole
bureau cheat on Inspectors' examinations, concoct fictitious informants,
manufacture phony informant reports, and create false statistics, even the most
egregious levels of corruption&#151;when top FBI officials lied to the courts,
the Department of Justice, and to the U.S. Congress&#151;no longer shocked me.
After witnessing twenty years of FBI wrongdoing, I had accepted it as a means to
survive in the bureau. So, when Elmer Pratt, the Los Angeles leader of the Black
Panther Party, was framed for murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1972 as
a target of COINTELPRO, I saw this wrongdoing as about a two on a scale of one
to ten.</P>
<P>Consequently, I did not call the attorney general of the United States or
the judge who was trying the case when I learned Pratt was to be framed and
imprisoned. Many critics have asked me how I could consciously and willingly
violate laws I had sworn to uphold. I was a young overzealous patriot, a real &quot;Yankee
Doodle Dandy&quot; who loved his country. I was a dangerous person to have in
public service because when there appeared to be a threat to our government, I
placed the other agents and myself above the law. We did what we thought was
good for the country. The other agents and I were the epitome of American naval
hero Commodore Stephen Decatur, who said in 1816, &quot;Our country, right or
wrong.&quot; Special Agent Joseph G. Deegan, chief of extremist investigations
at FBI headquarters, said at a special security conference in the Los Angeles
FBI field office in 1977, after his testimony before the Church Committee: &quot;We
are the only ones who know what is good for the country, and we are the only
ones who can do anything about it.&quot; The thought of becoming a
whistle-blower was against everything I had ever believed in. It was the hardest
decision of my life. I reviewed in my mind what I thought might be the reactions
of nearly every friend I ever had, from childhood to my retirement. What would
they think? What would they  say? The answers were always the same. What was
most important to me was what I thought of myself. If I were ever to have any
self-respect, I had to square my experience in the FBI with my conscience and my
country. Eighteen years after my retirement I still ponder my decision to become
a whistle-blower.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Haiti Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</H1>
<H2>
BY NACLA</H2>
<P>Not so long ago, most everyone on the Left agreed that U.S. intervention in
the internal affairs of another country should be opposed a priori. The case of
Haiti shattered that consensus. In the topsy-turvy world of post-Cold War
politics, U.S. troops landed on Haiti's shores in September 1994 to remove a
right-wing military dictatorship and restore a popularly elected leftist priest
to power. What did this intervention mean? Did such an action merit our cautious
support?</P>
<P>The issue divided the Lavalas alliance that voted Father Jean-Bertrand
Aristide into presidential office, and it divided the U.S. Left. At one end of
the spectrum were those who opposed intervention in Haiti in any form, whether
by U.S. troops or UN and Organization of American States (OAS) human rights
monitors. They recalled recent U.S. interventions in Latin America, as well as
the last time the U.S. Marines landed on Haitian shores in 1915 and hunkered
down for a nineteen-year occupation. On the other end were those who thought
only the United States had the clout, not to mention a moral responsibility, to
restore Aristide to office.</P>
<P>A related debate concerned whether the answer to Haiti's crisis lay in the
diplomatic suites of Washington or in the Haitian streets and mountains. Many in
the Haitian popular movement and some sectors of the U.S. Left believed that
only armed struggle or other forms of popular mobilization within Haiti could
break the back of military domination. Others placed their faith in negotiations
and a transition to democracy under U.S. tutelage.</P>
<P>Easy answers to the Haitian crisis have proven elusive. Haitian&#151;and
Latin American&#151;history has taught us not to expect the United States to
ride in on a white horse and altruistically save the day for democracy. Indeed,
the United States has rarely aided a government with a progressive agenda at
odds with U.S. business interests. Even the New York Times has reported on U.S.
support for Haiti's corrupt military rulers over the years. Confusing matters
further, U.S. policymakers seemed at war with themselves during Aristide's years
in exile. On the one hand, the United States said it supported the Haitian
president's return and was a driving force in negotiations to end military rule.
Yet, on the other hand, the U.S. government systematically subverted Aristide
and appeared to favor Lieutenant General Raoul C&eacute;dras, who headed the
September 1991 coup, and his cronies. </P>
<P>In many respects, Haiti is a paradigm of the new potentials and liabilities
of U.S. foreign policy in the 1990s. Without the Soviet Union as a
countervailing superpower, and therefore without anti-communist dogma to neatly
divide the world into friends and enemies, the United States has had to readjust
its ideological compass. While there is substantial continuity within planning
circles concerning the definition of the national interest, U.S. policymakers
now debate where significant U.S. interests lie, and how far the scope of U.S.
military power should reach more vociferously. Even where there is consensus,
new geopolitical strategies, diplomatic tactics and political-ideological
rationales have been brought into play. The crisis in Haiti has forced U.S.
planners to directly confront these issues. </P>
<P>The conservative media tend to depict Haiti as a hopeless quagmire into
which the United States has blindly waded. Anxiously awaiting the pull-out of
U.S. troops in late March 1995, they are primed to explode with righteous wrath
if a single U.S. soldier's life is lost in what one writer has coined &quot;the
immaculate invasion.&quot; By contrast, those in the liberal press typically
applaud the Clinton Adminstration for doing its duty to &quot;restore democracy&quot;
in Haiti. This school of thought empathizes, however, with an occupying force
that does not want to take on difficult tasks&#151;such as disarming the
paramilitary attach&eacute;s&#151;that might endanger the lives of U.S.
soldiers. </P>
<P>Despite their obvious differences, conservatives and liberals share one
premise: they consider the United States to be an unalloyed force for good in
Haiti. Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads&#151;the first book to analyze Haiti after
the U.S. intervention&#151;questions that central assumption by detailing the
role the United States played in creating the crisis it is now trying to
resolve. To counter the mainstream media's characteristic historical amnesia,
this volume places current events within the wider context of twentieth-century
Haitian history. Starting with the nineteenth-century War of Independence,
through the Duvalier dynasty, the election of Aristide, the coup, and the
current intervention, this volume traces the Haitian majority's tireless efforts
to bring about democracy&#151;and the equally tireless efforts of those
determined to squash it. </P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Leasing Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Leasing the Ivory Tower</H1>
<H2>BY Lawrence C. Soley</H2>
<P>Taking their cues from conservative critics, the media have dwelled almost
exclusively on a few stories about political correctness (PC), and in so doing
have missed the real story about academe. The real story is about university
physics and electrical engineering departments being seduced by Pentagon
contracts; molecular biology, biochemistry, and medicine departments being wooed
by drug companies and biotech firms; and university computer science departments
being in bed with Big Blue and a few high-tech chip makers. The story about
universities in the 1980s and 1990s is that they will turn a trick for anybody
with money to invest; and the only ones with money are corporations,
millionaires, and foundations. These investments in universities have
dramatically changed the mission of higher education; they have led universities
to attend to the interests of their well-heeled patrons, rather than those of
students.</P>
<P>The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) typifies in many ways
what has happened to universities in the real world outside anti-PC rhetoric.
Corporations have contracted with the university for research, hired its
professors as consultants, and endowed professorships. Foundations have
established independently operating fiefdoms on the UCLA campus, and tycoons
have become the advisors and namesakes of departments.16 Moreover, several other
universities have gone further than just naming professorships and departments
after millionaires and corporations, as UCLA has. For example, Glassboro State
College in Glassboro, New Jersey changed its name to Rowan College after
receiving $100 million from industrialist Henry M. Rowan, the founder of a
furnace company. Not since the Stalin era in the Soviet Union has a living
individual had a monument of this size named after him.</P>
<P>When donations are made to higher education by corporations, the donors
often receive massive benefits, even when strings aren't attached. In addition
to tax write-offs, corporations get enormous public relations benefits from
their donations. Philip Morris's Miller Brewing Company, for example, donates
$150,000 annually to the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, which provides
scholarships to African-American students. But Miller also spends more than
$300,000 a year to advertise the program and its contributions, and these
advertisements carry the Miller logo.</P>
<P>University administrators claim that such corporate and foundation money is
accepted without strings. But this claim doesn't mean that universities are
independent of their benefactors, according to Cal Bradford, a former fellow at
the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute for Public Policy. Bradford
should know. His contract wasn't extended after he criticized the university's
ties to corporations. The outside funds &quot;determine what universities will
teach and research, what direction the university will take,&quot; Bradford
says. &quot;If universities would decide that they need an endowed chair in
English, and then try to raise the money for it, it would be one thing. But
that's not what happens. Corporate donors decide to fund chairs in areas that
they want research done. Their decisions decide which topics universities
explore and which aren't.&quot;</P>
<P>In some cases, the influence of donors is direct rather than subtle: *At the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the College of Hotel Administration negotiated a
$2 million &quot;gift&quot; from the Japanese-owned ACE Denken Company, which
manufactures slot machines. The arrangement ties the college to ACE Denken in
perpetuity, pending a review every five years. The $2 million donation endowed a
doctoral program in hotel administration. For the gift, university
administrators promised to publish an annual monograph named for ACE on &quot;issues
facing the casino and gaming industry,&quot; to sponsor an annual seminar for
ACE management and their friends on a topic picked by ACE, and to present ACE
with an annual report on developments in gambling technology. The board of
regents of the university initially rejected the deal, calling it a contract,
not a gift. After some negotiations, however, they agreed to the deal with a few
weak restrictions.</P>
<P>*The $100 million gift to Glassboro State College from Henry M. Rowan in
1992 came with political strings explicitly attached. One part of the gift
consisted of $3 million in scholarships for the children of Rowan's employees.
However, the scholarships were only for children of Rowan's nonunion employees.
Rowan stated that he would make scholarships available to employees &quot;who
have worked harmoniously with their company,&quot; not those who &quot;won their
contracts through threats and strikes.&quot;20 Glassboro State College officials
accepted this discriminatory policy, stating that they didn't &quot;have any
problem with an individual giving to defined groups as long as it's not in
opposition to the interests of the institution.&quot; Union officials denounced
the agreement as typical of Rowan's antiunionism.21 Eventually, pressures from
unions, state legislators, and the media, not from the university, forced Rowan
to reverse his antiunion stance and allow scholarships to be given to his union
employees, too. Despite this reversal, Glassboro State's pronouncement indicates
the unprincipled positions that universities are willing to embrace in order to
get their hands on corporate and tycoon money.</P>
<P>
Glassboro State is not an isolated case. Universities are constantly searching
for new funding. One reason university administrators have strongly supported
the emphasis on research and other noninstructional projects at their
institutions&#151;even at the expense of teaching&#151;is that such projects are
perceived to enhance a university's prestige and to have the potential of
bringing in large sums of money. Universities are typically classified as to
whether they are a &quot;research institution,&quot; &quot;liberal arts college&quot;
or another class of university.22 Georgetown, Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, also in
Cambridge), Stanford, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut are classed
as research institutions, and most administrators would like to see their
universities described as being in the same class as these institutions.</P>
<P>In addition to prestige, research can potentially lead to direct economic
benefits. The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980
stimulated a race by universities to secure patents on their research
discoveries, in the belief that the patents might someday be valuable. Between
1986 and 1989, the number of patents issued to universities doubled from 619 to
1,145.23 The number of patents that universities secure, rather than the success
universities have in educating students, is now used as a measure by which
university administrators demonstrate their accomplishments.</P>
<P>Administrators see these patents as a long-run method for generating
revenues, but this has so far proved to be an illusion. Universities typically
have received little money from the research produced in their laboratories.
When universities do get large royalties, they usually come at a very high cost
to the public, as Michigan State University's (MSU) cisplatin patent
demonstrates. MSU received over $60 million in royalties from Bristol-Meyers
during the past decade for its patent on cisplatin, an anti-cancer drug used for
treating bladder, testicular, and ovarian cancers. Bristol-Myers Squibb received
an exclusive license to sell cisplatin (which means that only Bristol-Myers can
produce the drug) even though MSU developed cisplatin with federal funding.26
Bristol-Myers's profits from the drug have been enormous because it has had a
monopoly on production and sales.</P>
<P>Government actions have promoted these increasing ties between business and
universities. Although universities have always pandered to wealthy patrons,
universities' toadyism intensified after President Reagan slashed spending on
domestic programs. Reagan's cuts to student loans and funding for grant-giving
agencies put the pinch on universities. For example, the college work-study
program was cut by 26.5 percent, after adjusting for inflation. At the NIH,
budget cuts resulted in the funding of just 20 percent of highly meritorious
research proposals, as opposed to the 45-55 percent funded before Reagan took
office.</P>
<P>When grants to universities from agencies such as the NIH declined,
universities began looking to the private sector and well-funded Pentagon
programs for money. Today, some academic disciplines have become completely
enslaved to corporations and the Pentagon for research dollars. For example,
$1.8 billion dollars was allocated to university research by the Defense
Department in 1993. &quot;That money accounts for more than 80 percent of all
Federal research funds for electrical engineering, more than 70 percent of those
for materials and metallurgy, and more than 55 percent of those for computer
science,&quot; the New York Times reported.</P>
<P>Two changes in federal laws&#151;the 1980 University and Small Business
Patent Procedures Act (P.L. 96-517), which was supplemented by a 1983 executive
order extending the law to large corporations, and the 1981 Recovery Tax Act
(P.L. 97-34)&#151;also helped cultivate the current relationship between
universities and business. The 1980 law and later executive order allowed
universities to sell patent rights derived from research to corporations, even
if the federal government were the primary funder of the research that led to
the patents. The 1981 law increased corporate tax deductions for &quot;donations&quot;
made to universities.</P>
<P>These laws have made it worthwhile for corporations to get involved with
educational institutions. By sticking some of their dough into universities,
corporations are able to buy the results of university research, even though
much of the research is funded by the federal government. While federal tax
dollars fund about $7 billion worth of research, corporate dollars are used to
buy access to the results of the research&#151;at just a fraction of their
actual cost. This subsidy to corporations has had a positive impact on corporate
bottom lines, particularly in the fields of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.
Corporations have been able to shift part of their research-and-development
costs to universities, thereby increasing corporate profits.</P>

<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads</H1>
<H2>
BY NACLA</H2>
<P>Not so long ago, most everyone on the Left agreed that U.S. intervention in
the internal affairs of another country should be opposed a priori. The case of
Haiti shattered that consensus. In the topsy-turvy world of post-Cold War
politics, U.S. troops landed on Haiti's shores in September 1994 to remove a
right-wing military dictatorship and restore a popularly elected leftist priest
to power. What did this intervention mean? Did such an action merit our cautious
support?</P>
<P>The issue divided the Lavalas alliance that voted Father Jean-Bertrand
Aristide into presidential office, and it divided the U.S. Left. At one end of
the spectrum were those who opposed intervention in Haiti in any form, whether
by U.S. troops or UN and Organization of American States (OAS) human rights
monitors. They recalled recent U.S. interventions in Latin America, as well as
the last time the U.S. Marines landed on Haitian shores in 1915 and hunkered
down for a nineteen-year occupation. On the other end were those who thought
only the United States had the clout, not to mention a moral responsibility, to
restore Aristide to office.</P>
<P>A related debate concerned whether the answer to Haiti's crisis lay in the
diplomatic suites of Washington or in the Haitian streets and mountains. Many in
the Haitian popular movement and some sectors of the U.S. Left believed that
only armed struggle or other forms of popular mobilization within Haiti could
break the back of military domination. Others placed their faith in negotiations
and a transition to democracy under U.S. tutelage.</P>
<P>Easy answers to the Haitian crisis have proven elusive. Haitian&#151;and
Latin American&#151;history has taught us not to expect the United States to
ride in on a white horse and altruistically save the day for democracy. Indeed,
the United States has rarely aided a government with a progressive agenda at
odds with U.S. business interests. Even the New York Times has reported on U.S.
support for Haiti's corrupt military rulers over the years. Confusing matters
further, U.S. policymakers seemed at war with themselves during Aristide's years
in exile. On the one hand, the United States said it supported the Haitian
president's return and was a driving force in negotiations to end military rule.
Yet, on the other hand, the U.S. government systematically subverted Aristide
and appeared to favor Lieutenant General Raoul C&eacute;dras, who headed the
September 1991 coup, and his cronies. </P>
<P>In many respects, Haiti is a paradigm of the new potentials and liabilities
of U.S. foreign policy in the 1990s. Without the Soviet Union as a
countervailing superpower, and therefore without anti-communist dogma to neatly
divide the world into friends and enemies, the United States has had to readjust
its ideological compass. While there is substantial continuity within planning
circles concerning the definition of the national interest, U.S. policymakers
now debate where significant U.S. interests lie, and how far the scope of U.S.
military power should reach more vociferously. Even where there is consensus,
new geopolitical strategies, diplomatic tactics and political-ideological
rationales have been brought into play. The crisis in Haiti has forced U.S.
planners to directly confront these issues. </P>
<P>The conservative media tend to depict Haiti as a hopeless quagmire into
which the United States has blindly waded. Anxiously awaiting the pull-out of
U.S. troops in late March 1995, they are primed to explode with righteous wrath
if a single U.S. soldier's life is lost in what one writer has coined &quot;the
immaculate invasion.&quot; By contrast, those in the liberal press typically
applaud the Clinton Adminstration for doing its duty to &quot;restore democracy&quot;
in Haiti. This school of thought empathizes, however, with an occupying force
that does not want to take on difficult tasks&#151;such as disarming the
paramilitary attach&eacute;s&#151;that might endanger the lives of U.S.
soldiers. </P>
<P>Despite their obvious differences, conservatives and liberals share one
premise: they consider the United States to be an unalloyed force for good in
Haiti. Haiti: Dangerous Crossroads&#151;the first book to analyze Haiti after
the U.S. intervention&#151;questions that central assumption by detailing the
role the United States played in creating the crisis it is now trying to
resolve. To counter the mainstream media's characteristic historical amnesia,
this volume places current events within the wider context of twentieth-century
Haitian history. Starting with the nineteenth-century War of Independence,
through the Duvalier dynasty, the election of Aristide, the coup, and the
current intervention, this volume traces the Haitian majority's tireless efforts
to bring about democracy&#151;and the equally tireless efforts of those
determined to squash it. </P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chaos Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Chaos or Community?</H1>
<H2>By Holly Sklar</H2>
<P>The American Dream&#151;always an impossible dream for many&#151;is dying a
slow death. As the systemic causes go untreated, a host of local and national
leaders are peddling the snake oil of scapegoating. We don't have to swallow it.
Together, we can find real remedies to our common problems.</P>
<P>Three decades ago, in Where Do We Go From Here, Martin Luther King spoke
prophetically about polarizing national and international trends. He urged us to
choose community over chaos:</P>
<P>&quot;A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring
contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look at
thousands of working people displaced from their jobs with reduced incomes as a
result of automation while the profits of the employers remain intact, and say &quot;This
is not just.</P>
<P>&quot;We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today&#133;We still
have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. This may
well be mankind's last chance to choose between chaos and community.&quot;</P>
<P>In the last three decades, humankind has taken giant steps toward community&#151;and
chaos. The Cold War threat of coannihilation has faded, but many nations are
wracked by internal conflict. The United States grows increasingly disunited.
The ruinous social and economic trends that King warned us about have
intensified. Wealth is not trickling down. It is flooding upward. Real wages for
average workers have plummeted&#151;despite rising productivity. Many corporate
executives make more in a week than their workers make in a year. Unemployment
is high whether the economy is in recession or &quot;recovery.&quot; The &quot;War
on Poverty&quot; has given way to the escalating war on the poor. Once-thriving
communities are in decline.</P>
<P>Economic inequality is now so extreme that the wealthiest 1 percent of
American families have nearly as much as the entire bottom 95 percent. More than
a fifth of all children are living in poverty in this, the world's richest
nation. That's according to the government, which undercounts both poverty and
unemployment. Downward mobility has become the legacy for younger generations.
Neither two incomes, nor college degrees assure that younger families will ever
match their parents' living standards.</P>
<P>For more and more people, a job is not a ticket out of poverty, but into the
ranks of the working poor. Jobs and wages are being downsized in the &quot;leaner,
meaner&quot; world of global corporate restructuring. Corporations are
aggressively automating and shifting operations among cities, states and nations
in a continual search for greater public subsidies and lower-cost labor.
Full-time jobs are becoming scarcer as corporations shape a cheaper, more
disposable workforce of temporary workers, part-timers and other &quot;contingent
workers.&quot;</P>
<P>Workers are increasingly expected to migrate from job to job, at low and
variable wage rates, without paid vacation, much less a pension. How can they
care for themselves and their families, maintain a home, pay for college, save
for retirement, plan a future? How do we build strong communities? What about
the millions of people without jobs? This brand of economics is a prescription
for chaos.</P>
<P>The cycle of unequal opportunity is intensifying. Its beneficiaries often
slander those most systematically undervalued, underpaid, underemployed,
underfinanced, underinsured, underrated and otherwise underserved and undermined&#151;as
undeserving and underclass, impoverished in moral values and lacking the proper
&quot;work ethic.&quot; The angry, shrinking middle class is misled into
thinking that those lower on the economic ladder are pulling them down, when in
reality those on top are rising at the expense of those below. People who should
be working together to transform the economic policies that are hurting them are
instead turning hatefully on each other.</P>
<P>Instead of full employment, the United States has full prisons. It imprisons
Black men at a much higher rate than South Africa did under apartheid. The
military budget continues consuming resources at Cold War levels, while programs
to prevent violence and invest in people, infrastructure and the environment are
sacrificed on the altar of deficit reduction.</P>
<P>
Instead of dedicating itself to equal opportunity for children, society is
living a self-fulfilling prophecy: labeling more children as illegitimate,
expecting more children to fail, and declaring more children the enemy. A
society which sees a great number of its children as hopeless, is a society
without hope for the future.</P>
<P>To realize community over chaos we must revitalize democracy with plain talk
about who really benefits and who loses from government policy. We need vigorous
debate over how to reshape policy in the public interest&#151;not the pseudo
debate of false campaign promises, negative political ads and talk radio
hate-mongering.</P>
<P>Rights and &quot;entitlements&quot; taken for granted today&#151;among them
the eight-hour day, minimum wage, Social Security and the right of workers to
organize and bargain collectively&#151;were obtained in the face of strong
opposition. Many of these achievements are being eroded. Demagoguery is
threatening democracy. To realize community over chaos we must not only protect
old gains, but forge new social, political and economic rights for the 21st
century.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Leasing Excerpt</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><H1>A Titillating Excerpt from Leasing the Ivory Tower</H1>
<H2>BY Lawrence C. Soley</H2>
<P>Taking their cues from conservative critics, the media have dwelled almost
exclusively on a few stories about political correctness (PC), and in so doing
have missed the real story about academe. The real story is about university
physics and electrical engineering departments being seduced by Pentagon
contracts; molecular biology, biochemistry, and medicine departments being wooed
by drug companies and biotech firms; and university computer science departments
being in bed with Big Blue and a few high-tech chip makers. The story about
universities in the 1980s and 1990s is that they will turn a trick for anybody
with money to invest; and the only ones with money are corporations,
millionaires, and foundations. These investments in universities have
dramatically changed the mission of higher education; they have led universities
to attend to the interests of their well-heeled patrons, rather than those of
students.</P>
<P>The University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) typifies in many ways
what has happened to universities in the real world outside anti-PC rhetoric.
Corporations have contracted with the university for research, hired its
professors as consultants, and endowed professorships. Foundations have
established independently operating fiefdoms on the UCLA campus, and tycoons
have become the advisors and namesakes of departments.16 Moreover, several other
universities have gone further than just naming professorships and departments
after millionaires and corporations, as UCLA has. For example, Glassboro State
College in Glassboro, New Jersey changed its name to Rowan College after
receiving $100 million from industrialist Henry M. Rowan, the founder of a
furnace company. Not since the Stalin era in the Soviet Union has a living
individual had a monument of this size named after him.</P>
<P>When donations are made to higher education by corporations, the donors
often receive massive benefits, even when strings aren't attached. In addition
to tax write-offs, corporations get enormous public relations benefits from
their donations. Philip Morris's Miller Brewing Company, for example, donates
$150,000 annually to the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, which provides
scholarships to African-American students. But Miller also spends more than
$300,000 a year to advertise the program and its contributions, and these
advertisements carry the Miller logo.</P>
<P>University administrators claim that such corporate and foundation money is
accepted without strings. But this claim doesn't mean that universities are
independent of their benefactors, according to Cal Bradford, a former fellow at
the University of Minnesota's Humphrey Institute for Public Policy. Bradford
should know. His contract wasn't extended after he criticized the university's
ties to corporations. The outside funds &quot;determine what universities will
teach and research, what direction the university will take,&quot; Bradford
says. &quot;If universities would decide that they need an endowed chair in
English, and then try to raise the money for it, it would be one thing. But
that's not what happens. Corporate donors decide to fund chairs in areas that
they want research done. Their decisions decide which topics universities
explore and which aren't.&quot;</P>
<P>In some cases, the influence of donors is direct rather than subtle: *At the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the College of Hotel Administration negotiated a
$2 million &quot;gift&quot; from the Japanese-owned ACE Denken Company, which
manufactures slot machines. The arrangement ties the college to ACE Denken in
perpetuity, pending a review every five years. The $2 million donation endowed a
doctoral program in hotel administration. For the gift, university
administrators promised to publish an annual monograph named for ACE on &quot;issues
facing the casino and gaming industry,&quot; to sponsor an annual seminar for
ACE management and their friends on a topic picked by ACE, and to present ACE
with an annual report on developments in gambling technology. The board of
regents of the university initially rejected the deal, calling it a contract,
not a gift. After some negotiations, however, they agreed to the deal with a few
weak restrictions.</P>
<P>*The $100 million gift to Glassboro State College from Henry M. Rowan in
1992 came with political strings explicitly attached. One part of the gift
consisted of $3 million in scholarships for the children of Rowan's employees.
However, the scholarships were only for children of Rowan's nonunion employees.
Rowan stated that he would make scholarships available to employees &quot;who
have worked harmoniously with their company,&quot; not those who &quot;won their
contracts through threats and strikes.&quot;20 Glassboro State College officials
accepted this discriminatory policy, stating that they didn't &quot;have any
problem with an individual giving to defined groups as long as it's not in
opposition to the interests of the institution.&quot; Union officials denounced
the agreement as typical of Rowan's antiunionism.21 Eventually, pressures from
unions, state legislators, and the media, not from the university, forced Rowan
to reverse his antiunion stance and allow scholarships to be given to his union
employees, too. Despite this reversal, Glassboro State's pronouncement indicates
the unprincipled positions that universities are willing to embrace in order to
get their hands on corporate and tycoon money.</P>
<P>
Glassboro State is not an isolated case. Universities are constantly searching
for new funding. One reason university administrators have strongly supported
the emphasis on research and other noninstructional projects at their
institutions&#151;even at the expense of teaching&#151;is that such projects are
perceived to enhance a university's prestige and to have the potential of
bringing in large sums of money. Universities are typically classified as to
whether they are a &quot;research institution,&quot; &quot;liberal arts college&quot;
or another class of university.22 Georgetown, Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, also in
Cambridge), Stanford, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut are classed
as research institutions, and most administrators would like to see their
universities described as being in the same class as these institutions.</P>
<P>In addition to prestige, research can potentially lead to direct economic
benefits. The University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act of 1980
stimulated a race by universities to secure patents on their research
discoveries, in the belief that the patents might someday be valuable. Between
1986 and 1989, the number of patents issued to universities doubled from 619 to
1,145.23 The number of patents that universities secure, rather than the success
universities have in educating students, is now used as a measure by which
university administrators demonstrate their accomplishments.</P>
<P>Administrators see these patents as a long-run method for generating
revenues, but this has so far proved to be an illusion. Universities typically
have received little money from the research produced in their laboratories.
When universities do get large royalties, they usually come at a very high cost
to the public, as Michigan State University's (MSU) cisplatin patent
demonstrates. MSU received over $60 million in royalties from Bristol-Meyers
during the past decade for its patent on cisplatin, an anti-cancer drug used for
treating bladder, testicular, and ovarian cancers. Bristol-Myers Squibb received
an exclusive license to sell cisplatin (which means that only Bristol-Myers can
produce the drug) even though MSU developed cisplatin with federal funding.26
Bristol-Myers's profits from the drug have been enormous because it has had a
monopoly on production and sales.</P>
<P>Government actions have promoted these increasing ties between business and
universities. Although universities have always pandered to wealthy patrons,
universities' toadyism intensified after President Reagan slashed spending on
domestic programs. Reagan's cuts to student loans and funding for grant-giving
agencies put the pinch on universities. For example, the college work-study
program was cut by 26.5 percent, after adjusting for inflation. At the NIH,
budget cuts resulted in the funding of just 20 percent of highly meritorious
research proposals, as opposed to the 45-55 percent funded before Reagan took
office.</P>
<P>When grants to universities from agencies such as the NIH declined,
universities began looking to the private sector and well-funded Pentagon
programs for money. Today, some academic disciplines have become completely
enslaved to corporations and the Pentagon for research dollars. For example,
$1.8 billion dollars was allocated to university research by the Defense
Department in 1993. &quot;That money accounts for more than 80 percent of all
Federal research funds for electrical engineering, more than 70 percent of those
for materials and metallurgy, and more than 55 percent of those for computer
science,&quot; the New York Times reported.</P>
<P>Two changes in federal laws&#151;the 1980 University and Small Business
Patent Procedures Act (P.L. 96-517), which was supplemented by a 1983 executive
order extending the law to large corporations, and the 1981 Recovery Tax Act
(P.L. 97-34)&#151;also helped cultivate the current relationship between
universities and business. The 1980 law and later executive order allowed
universities to sell patent rights derived from research to corporations, even
if the federal government were the primary funder of the research that led to
the patents. The 1981 law increased corporate tax deductions for &quot;donations&quot;
made to universities.</P>
<P>These laws have made it worthwhile for corporations to get involved with
educational institutions. By sticking some of their dough into universities,
corporations are able to buy the results of university research, even though
much of the research is funded by the federal government. While federal tax
dollars fund about $7 billion worth of research, corporate dollars are used to
buy access to the results of the research&#151;at just a fraction of their
actual cost. This subsidy to corporations has had a positive impact on corporate
bottom lines, particularly in the fields of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals.
Corporations have been able to shift part of their research-and-development
costs to universities, thereby increasing corporate profits.</P>
