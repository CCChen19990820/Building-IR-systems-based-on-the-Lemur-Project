A work of art by Luigi Viprati: an exceptionally sized pipe, fully bird
eyed with gold and silver insertions.  More than 50 cm long, 15 cm high
with a 15 cm pure amber mouthpiece.  Perfectly smokable, it represents
his masterpiece which took him four months to create.

Glad to see the fine quality continuing here!  If you would
like a jpeg of a pipe I had Mark Tinsky make for me last
November, I will be glad to attach it to email. Let me know.
The design is based on a photo Alberto sent me of a SerJac.
We made a few alterations and....voila!

The pipe is a Radice (Radice is the brand of the craftsman that made
pipes for the old Ascorti factory).  Maybe that this pipe and another one
similar will come on to the market in the 'Commercial Area'.

I think we've got a _really_ good issue in store, folks! An unusual
amount of cigar-related submissions this time, and of course plenty on
pipes, too!  So join us now, as we open up the old ammo box, fill a
pre-WWI German porcelain pipe with our favorite AN/UYK blend, and pour
a pint of winter ale...

Halloo fellow pipe smokers.

I've been a subscriber to PD for some time now, but have never submitted.
The reason I write is because I am an 18 year old female pipe smoker (which
is odd, but in Alberta, it's legal) that has recently been asked to work on
Sundays in my fave pipe/cigar bar, Burlington's. Now this is no problem for
me, but I suspect some controversy and discomfort will arise because of my
age, gender and some of the "the boys' club is exclusive" guys that will
come in. If anyone can give me any advice on how I should aproach this
subject, or any tricks and words of wisedom for working in a tobacconists,
it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
Amanda Bouchard

[ I've sent a reply, to the tune of "have some fun and ham it up!"
Any others? -S. ]

<a name="4">Subject: Wholesale vender and product information</a>

I am located in Ketchikan, Alaska, which in Southeast Alaska,
approximately 679 miles north of Seattle, Washington and 235 mile south
of Juneau, Alaska.  I am looking at the possibility of opening a tobacco
and gift shop, which would service the local and surrounding communities
and also the tourist trade.  The tourist trade is the largest industry
in Ketchikan, with approximately 500,000 people coming through our town
during the months of May and September.  We also have tourist by way of
airlines and the Alaska Marine Highway,(State Ferry System).

What I need is contacts to wholesale venders of blended tobaccos, pipes,
cigars, and accessories, plus gifts and novelties.

If this is an area that you may be able to help with, I would greatly
appreciate any help you may be able to give me.  I feel the distance
between us eliminates any competition.

You may reach me at my home address, listed below or through the Email.

Thank you for your time and help.

Sincerely,

From: "John P. Giunta" &lt;????????????????????&gt;
<a name="5">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #230 -- January 10, 1997</a>

Hello Fellow Smokers,

An article of interest to us all appeared in the New York Times 
Medical Science Section on Tuesday, January 14, 1997 entitled, 
"Researchers Investigate (Horrors!) Nicotine's Potential Benefits".

The general theme of the article is that nicotine *may* be beneficial 
in the treatment or prevention of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's 
diseases.

Of course, funding for any research in this direction will be very 
difficult or impossible to get, but it is interesting to see that the 
more we learn, NOTHING in moderation is completely beneficial 
or completely harmful.

Hello Steve,

This digest continues to be one of my favorite cyberhaunts.  Please 
keep up the great work.

I have a section of an electronic bulletin that will be of interest 
to cigar smokers and by osmosis, to pipe smokers as well.

Best to all,

MAGAZINES & JOURNALS

A glance at the winter issue of "Cigar Aficionado":
Smoking academics

Smoking has been officially banished from most college campuses. 
Nonetheless, many academics consider the ivory tower the perfect 
milieu for a good stogy, writes Gene Crume, director of alumni 
affairs at Western Kentucky University. "To a cigar smoker, 
culture means the environment in which one savors a good smoke," 
he writes. "To those on college campuses, culture means 
intellectual discovery, inspirational research, and enriching 
philosophy. In other words, the ability to reflect, ponder, and 
gain insight. What better environment to smoke a cigar." Mr. 
Crume explores that idea with philosophers, anthropologists, and 
even development officers. He quotes academics who wax poetic 
about the fraternal bonding a good smoke can inspire -- the way 
they feel more in tune with a colleague who can appreciate a 
good Davidoff than they do with a professor who simply shares 
their discipline. But others are skeptical about making that 
much of a good smoke. Cigar smoking "is something I like to do 
if I'm doing paperwork, reading, or writing," the Rev. Theodore 
M. Hesburgh, president emeritus of the University of Notre Dame, 
told the writer. "I don't get metaphysical about it." (The 
magazine may be found at your library or newsstand.)

David,

	I saw your request for information in the pipes digest, issue
#230, and thought it would be helpful to you if I emailed you right off
rather than have you wait for the next digest.

	I live near Portland, but buy most of my smoking materials via
mail order.  There are, however, at least two, and maybe four places that
you may want to look into.

The Calabash -- in South Portland, near the Airport.  In the same complex
that STAPLES is in, Jetport Mall or something like that.  Good selection
of cigars, fair selection of pipe tobacco, fair to inconsequential
selection of pipes.  Also brews some good coffee on site.

Leaf and Bean -- In North Windham, in the same shopping complex that
houses the North Windham Post Office.  Good selection of cigars, fair to
inconsequential selection of pipes and pipe tobacco.  Also brews good
coffee.  

Both of the above welcome smokers in the shop and are friendly places to
hang out.  I have spent more time in Leaf and Bean because it is close to
my living quarters. 

Joe's Smoke Shop -- On Congress Street, I don't know the address and
haven't been there in awhile, but this is a smoke/newsstand sort of place.
Good selection of cigars, I don't know what they have for pipes and
related materials.

Seaport Tobacco -- In the Old Port section of Portland, Seaport is a place
that is also "newsstandy", like Joe's, but has a small humidor with
cigars.  Not a great selction the last time I was in, but they do carry
some quality cigars.  I can't recall ever looking for pipes or pipe
tobacco there.

You're going to be VERY disappointed.  Most of the cigar factories in
the DR are in the free trade zone, which means they are intended for
EXPORT.  If you can convince them to give you a factory tour, you
*might* be able to score something, but don't plan on it.....

<a name="11">Subject: Humidifiers</a>

Steve,
First of all my personal thanks to you for doing such a great job with
PD. I look forward to each month's issue and read it top to bottom.

I've noticed some activity recently with regards to humidifiers and
thought I would add my own experiences for what it's worth. Oasis foam
is a nice medium for the H2O/PG solution provided that you use the
proper oasis foam, which is the 'wet' type and not the 'dry' type, the
latter being used for dry arrangements. However, I think people ought to
know that there are some oasis type foams being sold which contain
chemical additives that are designed to prolong the life of fresh floral
arrangements. These chemicals are carcinogenic (according to the package
disclaimer) and impart a chemical taste and smell to the tobacco. I
ruined a box of cigars due to my oversight and I hope this will prevent
a problem for others in the future. Oasis is fine for stationary
humidifiers but I have a problem with their use in travel humidors. I'm
sure everyone knows that the oasis needs to be cut a little smaller than
the container in which it is placed to allow for a larger surface area
to come into contact with the air in the humidor. Well, it seems that
the oasis foam tends to crumble somewhat when it rattles around in a
travel humidor and this eventually ends up in the tobacco. I've tried
using other sponges to lesser degrees of success until I ran across a
new sponge in a drug store. The package had no description of its
composition but it appears to be some sort of high density polyurethane
foam. On the front of the package are the words "Super Clean Suction
Block" and "The King of Suction Blocks." It is about 2.25 x 4.5 x 1.25"
in dimension and is yellow in color. I detected no smell or taste (I
know, it sounds yucky but someone's got to do the dirty work) in the
foam. After a rinse in distilled water and a short drying time, I filled
it with H2O/PG solution and placed it in a humidor to stabilize. I
noticed that after a day it stabilized. Oasis foam tends to stabilize
after 2-3 days in a humidor. "Super Clean" will hold an good amount of
H2O/PG solution. So far after a month of use I have not detected any
taste or smell from the unit or in the tobacco and it has held a proper
70 percent at 70 degrees humidity in my humidor. The only draw backs
have been it's price (about $2 per block) and it's difficulty to cut
with an Exacto knife. I hope this helps.
Keep up the good work.
Miles

<a name="12">Subject: Re: Ammo Can Humidors</a>

&gt; From: Ted Wagner - WSS &lt;????????????????????????????????&gt;

&gt; I have seen mention of a humidor made from a U.S. Army ammunition box.
&gt; However, I have not been able to locate any instructions.  Because I have
&gt; won a hard fought battle to smoke in my den with the door close, I now want
&gt; to _keep_ tobacco on hand.  Does anyone know where to find the instructions
&gt; on making a humidor from a metal ammunition box?

&gt; [ There's been a discussion of "ammo boxidors" on alt.smokers.cigars
&gt; from time to time.  Some are of the opinion that the boxes pick up
&gt; machine oil, which might give an unpleasant taste to the
&gt; tobacco.  Can anyone here comment? -S. ] 

I've bought many surplus 50mm U.S. Army ammo cans for storage in the 
basement, and I can assure you that you DO NOT want to use one as a 
humidor... especially newly manufactured ones.  To be sure, when in good 
shape they are absolutely air tight.

The thick paint the manufacturers use will continue to give off a strong odor 
for many years inside the closed container.  Everything and anything placed 
inside will be prone to absorbing this odor.  Placing your tobacco in 
zip lock bags will not help much.  Polyethylene plastic used to make common 
plastic bags is gas permeable to an extent, so the paint smell WILL find it's 
way in rather quickly.

On the other hand, you might like the OD paint smell and flavor in your 
tobacco!  One might be able to invent a new line of MIL-SPEC pipe tobaccos 
and cigars. 

Best regards,

John

<a name="13">Subject: Ammo Box as a Humidor</a>

On perusing the digest (#230) there was mention by someone who would
like to use an ammo box as a tobacco humidor....which immediately
conjures up a Canadianism: WWT (Whoa, Whoa, Tabernac for the
acronymically challenged).  You see , the purpose of the ammo box is
three fold, with one being to keep the ammo clean (the ammo itself is
still placed in a cardboard box within the box), two being to keep the
ammo dry and three being to preserve the ammo as the constituent
components will degrade with time.  Now, the volleying of lead down
range has never been environmentally sound (not even personally sound
if you are in fact the intended subject of said volley) and neither
are the storeage methods.  Only after they ran out of manufacturers to
provide them with PCB's did the major armament companies stop using
these to prolong the life and keep the ammo dry, and you'll never
guess when they ran out ..... 1990 'ish.  So there's a good chance
that if you acquire an exhorbiantly priced ammo box due to its cache
and rugged good looks, the innards will still be coated with a fine
coating of chemicals you would prefer not to injest, whether in a
solid or gaseous form.  Just ask anyone who has placed food in an ammo
box whether it tastes all right after, and the response will
inevitably be 'no'.  Use the Mason(tm) Jars, not quite as funky, but
much better for you.

JR sells these on occasion with 101 Belinda in them.  I picked one up
about two years ago for 30 bucks (ahhh, for a $20 box of Double
Chateaus......)  Haven't had any problem with it, but Lew told me they
basically ran them through an industrial washer about a zillion times
and then they lined them with spanish cedar.  I've picked up a couple
other ammo boxes at the local base and I'm not entirely convinced I'd
want to try it myself :-)

From: ????????????????????? (Brian Y. Scott)
<a name="15">Subject: Ammo-Box Humidors</a>

Steve,

    I saw a couple of questions in the last PD regarding converted ammo 
boxes as humidors.  I built one of these, and it works pretty well.

    My office cigar humidor is a 7.62 (.30 cal) ammo can.  It came from 
a local surplus store and was in pretty good shape when I got it -- no 
apparent rust or oil.  I washed it out a couple of times with a mixture 
of bleach and mild soap, to kill anything growing in there, then let it 
air out for a few days.

    Then I glued in a liner of 1/4" Spanish Cedar on the bottom and 
sides, and also glued a Spanish Cedar panel to the inside of the lid.  
I added a Credo Rondo humidifier, and that was that.  Total cost was 
maybe 30 - 35 bucks.

    In my office, it works very well.  The ambient humidity there is 
about 30%, but the humidor maintains a constant 70 - 72%.  Because it's 
a sealed box, and doesn't breathe, it needs to be opened regularly.  
This hasn't presented a hardship thus far &lt;g&gt;.

    Maximum capacity of my AmmoDor is about 45 Rothschild-sized cigars, 
or maybe 20 - 25 Double Coronas.  I've been using it for several months 
now, and haven't noticed any untoward odors.  My cigars have stayed in 
great shape.

    On a different note, I just wanted to express my conditional thanks 
for the Pipe Digest -- I really look forward to its appearance in my 
inbox.  Why the "conditional thanks?"  Because you guys have got me 
smoking my pipes again, after a 10-year stint as a cigar-only smoker.  
Thus far, I've been keeping it simple -- Erinmore Mixture in a 
20-year-old Ben Wade bent.  But I know where this is headed -- tobacco 
experimentation, several new pipes, several old pipes, etc.

    BTW, anybody got some plans for a simple homemade pipe rack?  I 
think I'm gonna need another one soon (*sigh*).

Brian

From: "John P. Giunta" &lt;????????????????????&gt;
<a name="16">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #230 -- January 10, 1997</a>

Dear Steve and fellow Pipers,

I wish to offer some thoughts reflecting on Mr. Robert Davis' request 
for thoughts on pipe furniture.

I have a relatively modest collection of 18 or so pipes, about 6 of 
which I smoke with any regularity.  But I like for them all to be 
visible.

All of my pipes are bents, and I tend to choose bowls that are very 
different from each other.  This makes my choice of pipe stands 
almost impossible, for the pipe stands made for the average pipe 
smoker will always have the "dishes" for supporting the bowl of 
the pipe made with the same contour.  Some of my pipes flop over 
or lean to the side in my ready-made rack, making an untidy 
appearance for this ex-soldier.  If there were one need I had, it 
would be for the "dish" that holds the bowl to be DEEPER than is 
commonly cut in the ready-made racks.

Further, some of my pipes have stems that are of different lengths, so
I need for some places in the stand to have a slot in the stem holder
so that I can "lean" a tall pipe into its place, instead of having a
ring where I first have to lower the pipe, THEN insert the bit, THEN
lift the pipe to push the bowl back into its dish.  Tall pipes can't
be lowered very far if the rack is on a table.  Further, some pipes
have thicker shanks than the average pipe rack can accommodate, making
the average hole unusable for some pipes.  Calabash?  Forget it.  It
will have to stand alone on its own rack.

Another thought is in the form of a question:  How far would you like 
for the pipe to drop if you fumble it while replacing it into the 
rack?  On the table, that distance is short.  A wall-hanging pipe 
rack is a risk, but is the way to go if you have churchwardens or 
other longer-than-average-stemmed pipes and you are using a 
ready-made pipe rack.

My conclusion: Have a rack custom made, conferring in person with the
maker and having your pipes there in the shop.  Take measurements,
deciding the order in which you smoke the pipes, the symmetry of the
appearance when the pipes are in place, whether or not you will need
padding in the "dish" for meerchaums, the need for slots rather than
holes --gosh, that's a lot of planning, but for some people,
collecting is a hobby of constant reassessment.

A final note: Steve, you do a thoughtful and efficient job with this
Digest.  You are doing a fine service for all of us on the list.
Please keep it up!!

Many thanks and best wishes to all,
John

I am looking for an antique pipe rack with the following features:
* New when bought, around 1915 (+/- 3 years?) probably from 
a catalog, owner resided in North Dakota, U.S.  Possibly not a 
mass-produced item.
* About 8 inches wide
* Made of wood with 5 or 6 (?) wooden pegs sticking out to 
create holes for pipes to fall through.  This made it seem for 
many years to be a 'tie rack'.
*Poem etched/written into face of rack:
"Oft in the evening twilight
It brings back memories fond
I try to read the smoke wreaths
And think of friendships bond...
My pipe and I."
*Next to poem is a picture (etching/carving/painting?) 
of a man by a fireplace with his pipe, resting in a chair 
with a dog at his feet.  According to the once owner, "he had a 
look on his face that implied he didn't have a care in the world."

If you discover the whereabouts of this pipe rack, more info. 
on it, or know how I can be more successful in my search, 
please contact me ASAP.  The once-owner is aging quickly, 
and he says that he will die happy if he can find it.

Dear Steve and the Gang

Thanks very much for placing me on the distribution list for Pipes Digest.

As I will be leaving my present place of employment on Wednesday 15 January
1996, I will no longer have access to the internet and so it is with much
regret that I ask you to take me off the subscription list.

I have enjoyed the quality of the articles submitted, the banter, the advice
and tips but above all the comaraderie that has been and continues to be
created among we pipe smokers.

I wish you and all members of the Pipes Digest continued success and as soon
as I have access once again to the internet I will be asking to be placed on
the subscription list again.

Until then, to all of you it is my wish that your pipes smoke cool and dry
and may the cloud of pipe smoke above you always have a silver lining.

Smoke peace and bliss.

Yours faithfully

Kevin Ferguson

[ We'll look forward to your return, Kevin! -S. ]

Steve - 

Not that you need further evidence, but in reference to the above
incident, you should know that I also received the pitch from
Mr. Castro, and coincidently, had a note in PD#229, which was
definitely released BEFORE Mr. Castro's note.  It sure ain't no crime,
but he gets a definite 'guilty as charged' from me.

Just thought you'd like to know.

P.S.  Oh, and BTW, for what it's worth, I think you're following exactly the
      right track with these guys.  I seem to be averaging about 1 junk mail
      for every legitimate email message I get.  Maybe if we stomp on 'em now,
      they'll get the hint before it gets out of control.  (Wishful thinking,
      I know, but you're still doing the right thing.)  JTD

Thanks for the outstanding issue of PD!

I can't tell you what a treat this is.  I had been a long-time fan of
Craven Mixture, and to stumble across PD on the Internet, search the

it just shows you that this technology can occasionally be extremely

?????????????????? asked:
&lt;&lt;So here's my question.  What is the different between regular beer and winter
beer.

An example would be Samuel Adams' Lager, compared to Samueal Adams' Winter
Ale.&gt;&gt;  

Well, according to the book _Real Beer and Good Eats_, a winter ale is
described as "amber to dark, often spiced."  Winter lager is described much
the same way.  So, it seems that a Winter Ale is probably going to be a bit
darker than the usual brew, and likely spiced with something.

Here's an empirical description of these interesting beverages as I have
found them over here in the u.k.
They tend to be sweet, if not a bit heavy in taste and feel.
Some of them are too sweet, giving the impression that they are beer
mixed with a sweet wine.
But, the better ones have a hoppier/maltier character, and don't come
over obnoxiously sweet. Typically, the alcohol content is higher than
your typical lagers. Course, we come to the pragmatic differences
between beer and lager. If I have this right, beers are fermented at or
near room temperature, whilst lagers are processed cold. But, I have
seen beers that taste like lagers, and the reverse. I don't know what
these winter ales are, but I think that they are probably, or aught to
be classed as beers. The net result is a hearty brew which if not too
sweet gives real pleasure, and goes well with a good tobacco. This is
just one user's opinion, and probably wrong in the first place. (g&gt;)
I haven't tried the S.A. stuff over here as it's rather hard to find.

to play.

<a name="31">Subject: German Porcelain Pipe Translation Attempt</a>

hi steve. 

i just read the message that is printed on the pipe. wondering about the
number of names that are supposedly mentioned on the pipe. 66 sound quite
a lot! if that number holds true, it will be the complete troop (or
regiment). my friend and i will give it a shot and try to translate the
text on the pipe - - - instead of studying "accounting for intercompany
transactions" (yuk!).

[ Original message deleted. -S. ]

first of all, here is how the original german text ran - at least how we
think it ran. congratulations to anthony for the deciphering work he did
considering the fact that the text on the pipe is probably set in letters
that are outdated since the late thirties!!! even young people here in
germany would have problems with this text...
the text on the back actually states the name of the original owner and
the troop he belonged to. the other text is actually a poem. 
here we go (not abbreviated!):

BACK

"Zum Andenken an meine Dienstreise
bei der 4. Kompanie 2. Oberrhein(isches)
Infanterieregiment Zabern
1901 / 1903"
translation:
"In Reminder of my (official) visit
to the 4th Kompanie 2nd Infantry-Regiement of upper Rhenania
at Zabern 
1901 / 1903"
this translation is a first guess only. we are positive about the
occasion on which this pipe was presented: the owner officially visited
some troop at the troop's base in south-western Germany. Zabern actually
is a small town in what's now called Baden-Wuertemberg (or so we think!).

FRONT
"Reserve General Biemons:
Wer nie sein Brot mit Traenen ass, 
Wer nie bei Vater Philipp sass,
Wer keine Nacht ist durchgebrannt, 
wird auch nicht Reservist genannt.

Halt! Wer da?
Die Reservisten der 4. Companie Linddo
Praesentiert das Gewehr!"
Translation:
"To the General in Reserve (Inactive General):
Who never ate his bread without breaking into tears,
Who never sat with (or: confessed to) Father Philipp,
Who never deserted for a night,
Will not be called a Reservist.

Don't move! Who's there?
The reservists of the 4th Kompanie Linddo
present your guns!"

unfortunately, we could not think of a suitable translation of the word
"Linddo" which we think could be a town (maybe Lindau; also a place in
south-west Germany). we look forward to seeing the original pipe on the
web page. then, it will be easier to come up with a translation.

if we can be of any further help, let us know. i will look around here in
my small college town if i can find some old man who would know about the
troop description (it /$&"$"$)/*-old; it's pre-WWI!).

smoke in peace, 

alex & holger.

From: Anthony Amorteguy &lt;???????????&gt;

Hello Steve,
after enjoying PD for about a year this is my first posting to the 
group.
As I never sent anything to a moderated group before I am not sure if 
I am right in my guess that postings should be sent to the 
moderator's adress and not to ????????????????

[ Administrativa deleted. ??????????????? is fine. -S. ]

But now for the main reason of this posting:
(I will sent a copy of this part to Anthony Amorteguy too.
So please feel free to delete the message in whole or in part if you 
think that it is not of general interest.)

The regimental pipe owned by Anthony Amorteguy seems to be a 
farewell-present to a Reserve Private first class called "Biemons" 
who was in this regiment from 1901 until 1903 .
Pipes like this were common gifts to soldiers of the reserves leaving the 
troops. 
They were usually made of porcelain and they would usually bear the 
names of the other members of the reserves of the particular 
regiment and a few funny and ribald slogans.
While the name and the rank of the former owner seems to be clear 
after reading the details Anthony gave in his posting, I am not sure 
about the town in which the regiment was located. 
The word after "Inf. Reg. No. 99" (Zabern or Labern) _might_ be the 
name of a town but my guess would be that it is the proper name of 
the regiment, for example a former general or so.
Anyway, the German zip-code dictionary does not list any town named 
Zabern or Labern.
The word after "Die Reservisten der 4 Comp" (Linddo) might more 
likely be the name of the town. According to the zip-code there is no town 
called "Linddo" but there is one with a similar name "Lindau". 
Would it be possible that this is the word inscribed in the pipe?
The regiment is called "Oberrheinisches" which means "upper Rhine 
located" so the regiment was probably (but not necessarily) based in the 
upper region of the river Rhine.
I think the town Landau would fit the description but I would have to check 
in an atlas first which I am alas unable to find at the moment.

I have tried to give a translation of the details Anthony sent us:
&lt;The passages in brackets are the original passages.&gt;

Patrick's correct here. There is a large area of woodland & hills right

"wood"). 

&gt; &gt;&gt;Wernie sein Brod mit Thranen a(letters missing)

We argued quite a while whether the verse "Wer nie bei Vater Philipp sass"
refers to having confessed or to a bar/pub called whose proprietor would
have been Vater Philipp. Given the colloquial context of the entire text,
we finally decided in favor of Patrick's version.

<a name="35">Subject: Pipes, Hawaii, and other Miscellany</a>

Happy New Year to one and all,

It's been a little while since I chimed in, so I thought I'd share some   
pleasant smoking moments with all of you.

I guess I'll start out with the pipe I bought myself for Christmas.  I   
had gone up to my favorite pipe shop, Poor Richard's of San Bernardino   
because I needed some pipe cleaners and butane fuel, and that was all   
(yeah, right).  Unfortunately for my credit card balance, they had   
recently gotten in some new stock for Christmas and what to my wondering   
eyes did appear, but the Stanwell '96 Pipe of the Year.  This is a   
sandblasted billiard with a hexagonal shank, silver band, and silver   
plate that says Stanwell 1996.  I usually prefer a smooth pipe, but every   
once in awhile a sandblast just feels right, and this was one of those   
times.  This is a great pipe-a pleasure to smoke, a pleasure to hold, and   
a pleasure to look at.

Shortly thereafter (Thanksgiving week to be exact), my wife and I spent a   
week on Maui.  I was a little unsure about a vacation in Hawaii because   
I'm really not a fun in the sun kind of guy, but my wife has been wanting   
to go, so since it was our 5th wedding anniversary, away we went.  It   
took me all of one day to get real used to the place.  Of course, while I   
was there, I looked in the local phone book to see if there were any   
tobacco shops around, and I did find one.  Sir Wilfred's in Lahaina.   
 Their primary line of business is selling their own blends of the local   
Kona coffee-which my coffee-drinking friends swear by (I don't indulge   
myself-never acquired the taste), but the back third of the store is   
devoted to pipes and cigars.  Not a large selection of either, but surely   
adequate.  In fact, I found some Fuente Hemmingways which I have not been   
able to find anyplace else recently.  Prices were high, but then, prices   
on everything are kind of high in Hawaii.

Christmas was, for me, about as pleasant a time as I could wish for.   
 About 2 years ago, my wife and I undertook to redo my study.  It was a   
jumble of cheap office furniture, particle board storage cubes, and   
stacks of boxes.  It had a fireplace, but no one would want to sit in   
there to enjoy the fire.  Well, we gave away everything, threw out the   
rest, and started from the floor up.  Now it's got an L-shaped computer   
desk in one corner, bookcases full of my favorite reading (lots of   
Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe, and Rumpole of the Bailey) two leather   
recliners and a loveseat in front of the fireplace.  The last touch, my   
wife and I decided to pool our gift money and buy ourselves a gas log.   
 So Christmas and the days following, I spent much time in there warming   
my tootsies, drinking some pretty decent Scotch, and smoking Noel 1994   
(green label), one of Bob Hamlin's limited edition tobaccos.  I don't   
know how I came to be so lucky, but I'm grateful for it.  In every   
edition of the Digest I read the comments of fellows who search high and   
low for a warm, comfortable place to sit and smoke in peace, and here I   
have such a place in my own home.  It's kind of humbling, if you know   
what I mean.

Well, I have no doubt this has gone on long enough, so I end it here.  My   
wish for each and every one of you is that you'll always have plenty of   
tobacco to smoke, a pipe to smoke it in, and a comfortable place to smoke   
in peace.

Hi there,

In the most recent pipe digest, you printed a letter from Marcus Matzick from
Prince Edward Island, Canada and he wanted info on other pipe smokers on PEI.

Well,  I live in Montreal, Quebec, but my FIANCEE lives on PEI and I make
the 12 hour drive about once every other month (ah, the joys of long distance

So, please feel free to pass on my name and e-mail address on to Marcus. I'd

Thanks so much.

Steve, et al,

First off the seemingly obligatory, but nonetheless well deserved, praise
of both the digest and the web page - both represent standards the rest
of the net should try to attain/maintain!

Secondly, I recently had the good fortune to purchase a nice pipe rack and
an ashtray with "hollows" fitted to hold two pipes along with a bunch of 
pipes which I assumed were throw-aways. However, when I got home with my 
loot and inspected the pipes further, I discovered I really liked a couple, 
kind of liked a couple more and was at least curious about the others. 

These pipes were Medico and Thermofilter (the couple I kind of liked)and
Kuske's - the one I *really* like is marked Kuske's on the stem and has a 
script "K" on the bit. It seems to be very nicely built pipe and it's grain
is quite attractive. 

I'd really appreciate any info on these brands - I did find Medico mentioned
using the keyword search of old digests but came up empty on the others.

Oh and if there are suggestions of how to fill all those spots in the rack
and holder, I'd be interested in hearing those too (a word in advance - 
Peterson's and other 3-figure pipes are a touch out of range for me)

Thanks in advance,

R~

  I've been smoking a pipe for about 4 months now, and love it.  My
inquiry today is there a such thing as a bad smoke from a meerschaum, 
I've heard of the debates about cheap briar pipes, but was curious if
a cheap meerschaum would have as good of a quality smoke as a more
expensive meeschaum.  I looked at lighters galore web page and they 
have some meerschaums that are reasonable priced ($25 for a 6inch pipe)
and was thinking about getting one.

Greetings fellow smokers,

I haven't posted in awhile, but i realized that I've been on this mailing
list for over a year now. Time flies when your having fun. I have been a
cigar smoker for three years now and I have tried many types of cigars, and
have  had a few Cubans (when I got lucky enough to  procure them) and love
all the "toys" associated with them.  I have many friends that smoke them and
I have introduced a few people to the art of cigar smoking.

But now, I turn to you. I regularly read the PD and have heard many different
things about pipes, both positive and negative.  Tobacco and the types of
tobacco people prefer......And yes, It's time that I try a pipe. But since
I'm just beginning, I don't know where to start........obviously a pipe. I'm
 not interested in going out and spending a fortune either. I just want the
basics, so whoever out there  is willing to school a brand spanking new pipe
smoker (who has yet to smoke a pipe) I will greatly appreciate the
information  on what to buy...........
thank you very much................
And Steve keep up with the PD, I want to be able to post messages for years
to come.

Dear sir,
  I'm a relative newcomer to the pipe smoking game, and I have a question
which I hope you will answer for me.  The only pipe I've ever owned was a
clay pipe of the 'churchwarden' type, about fourteen inches in length, with
a gentle arch to the stem.  It was passed to me by my grandfather, now long
deceased.
  I've foolishly broken my treasure, and have no way of finding another.  My
local tobacconist (sp?) doesn't stock anything that will answer.  I've
searched the net, but with no relief.  I don't wish to spend a fortune, but
am not afraid of paying for quality.
  One last note...
Being a scotsman (still a Brit subject), I'd like to find a Scot or Irish
brand.  Is this possible?  Any consideration greatly appreciated.

Hi Steve and all other pipe smokers!

I think you do a terrific job with the PD. I love reading each issue.

A number of folks have written in about the types of pipes they
like. I have two questions: Does anyone smoke Carey's Magic Inch
pipes? I've only seen one posting mentioning them. I discovered them
20 years ago, and have enjoyed their cool smoke ever since. Anyone
else out there like them?

Second: I've read a lot in the PD about pipe collecting. I didn't
realize antique or older pipes were collected. I'd like to get
involved in this, but I'm not sure where to start. Any suggestions
regarding books, magazines, associations or home pages?

Finally, I , like many other writers, was accused of wanting to look
"older" or "more studious" when I took up a pipe at the age of 18. But
the fact was, I just liked the aroma, and the pleasure that comes from
handling (and caring for) a really good pipe. Most pipe-smokers I know
are actually far from pretentious.

Again, thanks for the good job, and smoke in peace!

Mark Carroll

[ Don't they still sell the Carey's pipes in Popular Mechanics?  And,
regarding collecting, I'd recommend going to a show or two, and maybe
subscribing to one of the magazines, to get a taste of your personal

Hello, Steve.  

Thanks for doing all of us Digest-ers this great service.  Like
everyone else, I find myself looking forward to each issue of the
Digest that comes across my In box.

I wonder if anyone out there remembers those double-walled porcelain
pipes called Baronite? Years ago Troost offered a line of them in
their tobacco tins.  I would be interested in purchasing one (or more)
if they are still around.  If anyone has information about them, or,
better yet, a few stashed away somewhere, I would appreciate hearing.

Two tobacco questions.  Does any of our fine tobacconists on the Web
sell the Peterson tobaccos?  Again, I would be interested in a
purchase.

And, finally, there is a nice list of famous pipesmokers on the Web,
courtesy of OoOPS.  Does anyone know what tobacco some of them smoked?

In the spirit of give and take: I have found those green soft scrub
cloths from 3M not only good for washing dishes but also for cleaning
and polishing pipe bits.  I recommend using a different one from the
one the wife uses on the dishes; but when used with a little baking
soda paste or non-flavored toothpaste, I find they clean bits quickly
without marring the surface.  If you don't have a buffing wheel, might
try this.

I first visited this store on the 21st of January. Immediately there is
the understated quality of a first rate tobacconist

According to an official sertificate on the wall, Thomas hollingsworth
set up the store, and in december 1843 was appointed tobaconist to his
royal highness prince Albert
The store has been going ever since.
This is the only specialist tobaconist in birmingham at this time.
According to Keith one of their champions, and pipe smoker extraordinary
there are some 160 or so loose tobaccos and most prepackaged blends are
represented.
pipes range from 9.95 for their basket selection which I was very
impressed with, to 800 for a straight-grained savinelli.

I spent best part of an hour, smelling, tasting, and discussing various
blends, and types.
Indeed, I have found their service, and assistance first rate.
Ask for either Paul or Keith.
One of their prime offerings is their "achievement" a blend of 5
tobaccos including Turkish, cured virginia, Cavendish and a strong presence of
Latakia.
They suggest that this is a close approximation for the discontinued
Subrani Mixture.
I heartily recommend this for the resource list.

Dear fellow pipe smokers,

Sorry!  In my last report on a Tokyo pipe smokers' meeting, I gave a
wrong international telephone code for Japan.  It's +81, not +1
(which is for the States).  So, once again,

Kikusui -- Tel: +81-3-3571-0010
Kagaya  -- Tel: +81-3-3352-3689

I don't think it's very likely that someone living outside Japan
will make an international call to these shops, but just in case.
And if you happen to find yourself in Tokyo on a business trip or on
holidays, I'd recommend you visit either or both of these shops.
Everything is probably priced higher over here than at your home,
but since each piece of pipe is unique, you may find "the" pipe
which suits you best, even in the same make/line/shape/finish that
you're looking for.

And I forgot to include the address of Dunhill Tokyo:

Alfred Dunhill, Tokyo Branch
[I'm not very sure about their official name]
Ginza 6-5-13, Chuou-ku
Tokyo, JAPAN
Tel: +81-3-3289-0511

As for our "club" in Tokyo becoming permanent, well, I'm not very
sure.  At the pub, we did talk a lot about naming it ("Tokyo Chimney
Cleaners," "Tokyo Briar Boys," etc...), but in strictly private
opinion of mine, it will be fine enough as long as we can get
together, have a chat and enjoy bowls of tobacco when we feel like
doing it.  So, anyone interested is encouraged to contact me at my
e-mail address.

Hello,
I've been a silent member of PD for about a year now -- silent because I

few discussion groups worth reading.  PD came along just in time to save
me from dismissing the net altogether.

I'm a graduate student in English at UNC Chapel Hill.  Given my interest
in Southern Literature, one would think that I'd be surrounded by pipe
smoking faculty and grad students.  Not so--the images of pipe-smoking
lit folks smacks of the old school, and the only place you're likely to
see a pipe in someone's mouth is on the wall in a Faulkner or Melville
photo.  Gone are the days when one could take his Ph.D. exams while
puffing on a bulldog.  Now the only faculty member I know who smokes a
pipe does so in his office after hours with the window open (and still
doesn't escape nasty memos from admin super-sniffers).  Ah, well.

At any rate, I'm interested in pipes made from wood other than briar.
What's the common wisdom on the best woods and the verdict on smoking
performance?

Thanks.

&gt;perhaps 1/3 of the bowl. You want to have it slightly springy, neither
&gt;loose nor tight. It should be easy to draw through. Use the reamer to
&gt;loosen it if it's too tight.

Could you further explain what I need to do to use the reamer to loosen it
if it's too tight. I know this must sound really naive, but I'm new to pipe
smoking and really love it. I just don't know all the ins and outs. Where
exactly is the reamer used? Do you stick it straight down into the tobacco
in the bowl? or do you run it along the edge of the inside of the bowl?
Thanks for your input.
Rich

[ What I do is stick it down the side, wiggle it around a bit, and
re-tamp. Repeat as necessary until it draws well. -S. ]

First, aromas are a matter of conditioning.  Many remember fondly the
aroma of their father's, grandfather's, etc. pipe.  Where aversion has
been conditioned, it takes reverse conditioning.  You can do a "study"
to link almost anything -- "There are three kinds of lies; lies,
damned lies and statistics.." (I credit this line to Will Rogers.)

     Steve:
     
     I am a subscriber to the Pipes Digest. I am a relatively new pipe 
     smoker, and I particularly enjoy Captain Black (White Pouch).  I 
     noticed that Captain Black has 3 other different color packs.  I was 
     wondering if you knew the differences in taste, aroma, etc. between 
     the 4 Captain Black varieties.
     
     Could you recommend other commercial blends that are similarly mild 
     and as good tasting as Captain Black (White)?
     
     Thanks,

Hi again Steve

Thanks for the (quick!) reply - I'm sure it'll be OK now.

I have one quick question for you if possible:
I'm a student from South-Africa, and seek a nice easily available 
tobacco to smoke.   Which one can you recommend in the Holland House 
and Borkum Riff ranges; and what other tobacco's are usually popular 
with the not-so-professional pipe-smokers or younger smokers?

Thanks a lot
Charl

[ And again, I'll have to defer to the Holland House/Borkum Riff
aficionados on this one, Charl. -S. ]

Greetings Everyone,

I am a beginning pipe smoker.  I would like to know how to produce
smoke rings.  I have poked around the Internet a little, trying to
turn up information on the subject, but to no avail.  Would some of
you accomplished smoke ring blowers please carefully describe how to
do this?

Thank you,
Tim Height

[ The basic idea is to make a perfect O with your lips and give the
smoke a little push with your tongue.  I think that either the
alt.smokers.pipes or alt.smokers.cigars FAQ goes into more detail on
this; both are linked to the PD web page. -S. ]

<h2><center>LIKE THEIR CIGAR COUSINS, PIPES ARE HOT AGAIN</center></h2>

<p> When Joliet attorney Doug Sullivan recently was offered a fat cigar
by a co-worker, he grimaced and shook his head no. Cigars, Sullivan
explained, are passe.

<p> Now when the 32-year-old Sullivan smokes, he lights up a pipe. He is
considerably younger and less wrinkled than the images of venerable pipe
smokers like Sherlock Holmes, Albert Einstein, Mark Twain and Gen. Douglas
MacArthur, and is just the type helping revitalize the pipe industry.

<p> Even as the cigar craze continues to spread, the pipe and tobacco
industry is perking up as well, luring in smokers who want to try
something different and distinct. Meanwhile, those who abandoned the
practice in the no-smoking 1980s are digging out their old pipes,
encouraged by the explosion of cigar-smoking rooms in restaurants
and bars.

<p> Pipe tobacco sales are expected to increase 24.8 percent over the
next year, according to a recent market survey conducted by Raleigh,
N.C.-based Communication Technology.

<p> The research firm also says sales are growing for two of the most
popular types of pipe--briers, made from brierwood and by far the most
popular type, and meerschaums, the second-most popular type. The latter
are made of a white claylike material.

<p> "I just can't get them out fast enough," said Park Forest pipemaker
Clarence Mickels, 59, who has been carving pipes since 1976. "I've got
stores in California and on the East Coast who want pipes, and I'm
putting in 18 hours some days."

<p> Chicago's two largest full-service tobacco stores, Iwan Ries and Up
Down Tobacco, say pipes are having their best year in quite some time.
In Skokie, the Gift and Tobacco Emporium has added a new pipe display
case, though cigars are hogging most of the space.

<p> And while women generally aren't smoking pipes themselves, some are
buying them for their cigar-smoking husbands for Christmas, hoping to
encourage a habit with a less offensive aroma.

<p> "It's not just cigar smokers who are turning to pipes, it's people
trying to quit cigarettes, too," observed Gift and Tobacco Emporium
owner Harry Yablon. "Guys also pick up corncobs just to test them and
then move on to real pipes."

<p> Despite the recent surge, pipe smoking still has a long way to go
before it matches its previous peak of popularity. In 1970, an estimated
52 million pounds of pipe tobacco was sold, compared with 7.5 million
in 1996, according to the Washington D.C.-based Pipe Tobacco Council.
What encourages tobacconists is that the rate of decline is slowing from
year to year and may be bottoming out.

<p> "The feeling among pipe tobacco companies is that as more people
walk into tobacco shops to buy cigars, they smell the aroma, pass the
blending bars and the pipe displays, and they'll start to purchase pipes
and tobacco," said Norman Sharp, president of the Pipe Tobacco Council
and Cigar Association.  "Pipe evenings are taking place for pipe smokers
just as they are for cigar smokers. They're just not as widespread."

<p> The cigar rage really began to take off in 1992, when Marvin Shanken
launched the slick magazine Cigar Aficionado, sending cigar sales soaring.

<p> Movie stars and models such as Matt Dillon, Demi Moore and Linda
Evangelista were shown posing with cigars on the cover, and stogies were
associated with glamor and success.

<p> Like gourmet coffee and microbrewed beer, cigars became popular with
young professionals, who began buying higher-quality brands.

<p> The pipe industry responded by launching the quarterly Pipes and
Tobaccos Magazine last year. Unlike Cigar Aficionado, Pipes and Tobaccos
spotlights a different pipe on its cover each month, addressing the
accessory and act of pipe smoking rather than an image it creates.

<p> "There are a lot more pipe smokers out there than people realize,"
said Pipes and Tobaccos Editor Dayton Matlick. "I've had an outpouring
of people saying, `Thank God, finally something about pipes!'"

<p> The Pipe Tobacco Council estimates that of the 3 million pipe smokers
nationwide, 90 percent are white males and 46 percent graduated from
college.

<p> While doctors make up the largest group of customers at Iwan Ries,
according to owner Charles Levi, the Pipe Tobacco Council says most pipe
smokers are in clerical, sales or technical fields, followed by those
who work in precision crafts and repair.

<p> It makes sense; many pipe smokers love the ritual and careful attention
it takes to smoke a pipe.

<p> Pipes can be hand-carved and personalized, and collectors see them
as wooden sculptures that require upkeep and polishing.

<p> "It's the process and complicated nature of smoking that is so
appealing," said Jeff Price, 36, of Glenview. "It's kind of like making
tea. You have to get the tobacco just right and keep it lit just right.
There's a delicate little balance. It forces you to sit and adopt a
relaxed mind-set."

<p> Not everyone is excited about the resurgence of pipes. The American
Cancer Society reports that pipe and cigar smokers experience overall
mortality rates slightly higher than those of non-smokers, but
substantially lower than cigarette smokers.

<p> A pipe smokes sweeter than a cigar, and although there is a greater
initial investment, pipes can also be more cost-effective in the long run.
But those in the industry say pipes aren't likely to become as popular
as cigars, since they're high-maintenance.

<p> "Guys don't want to keep all that junk with them, the pipe, the tamper,
the pouch," said Mark Nickel, owner of Bull & Bear Ltd. in St. Charles,
where he has seen pipe sales increase 5 percent this year.

<p> "Then you're always relighting it because it goes out. The ashes burn
holes in your pants, and your car has holes in the seat," he said. "Plus
guys would rather remind women of Mel Gibson than their grandfather."

<title>The Wall Street Journal article on pipe smoking</title>

The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition -- December 31, 1996<br>
Fill! Tamp! Light! Relight!<br>
Can the Pipe Shake Its Image?<br>
By SUEIN L. HWANG Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
</center>
<hr>
Jazz wafts through the dimly lit New York bar as black-clad servers work
the crowd with platters of hors d'oeuvres and snifters of Courvoisier
cognac. As the evening wears on, the inevitable haze of smoke fills the
air as groups of well-dressed professionals light up.
<p>
But the smoke isn't coming from cigars, the old-fashioned smokes that
have been embraced by a new generation of young bar-hoppers, and certainly
not from cigarettes. "Welcome to the first renaissance in pipe smoking,"
declares Adam Mazur, publicist for luxury tobacco maker Alfred Dunhill
Ltd.
<p>
In a bid to cash in on the cigar craze, pipe makers are engaged in a
seemingly quixotic bid to make the pipe, longtime geek of the tobacco
world, the next cool smoke. Lacking hefty marketing budgets and expertise,
a smattering of mostly obscure pipe brands are staging offbeat events to
raise public awareness and introduce a new generation to the intricacies
of pipe smoking. Dunhill's seminar, for example, featured an expert
expounding on pipe lore, upkeep and "the finer points of pipe etiquette."
<p>
However, even pipe enthusiasts admit that pitching Hugh Hefner's
favorite prop to the MTV generation has its challenges. Unlike cigars,
where even the most expensive brands top out at $20, pipes require a
serious initial investment, with premium brands running in the hundreds
of dollars. What's more, they are forever going out, require regular
care and cleaning, and must be filled and "tamped" every time a smoker
wants to light up -- no mean feat when holding a drink at a crowded bar.
<p>
But most observers say that the biggest problem pipes must overcome is
their image. "I started smoking a pipe in college, but I stopped because
I looked like a pompous ass," says Norman Perkel, a 28-year-old seller
of office equipment who dropped by Dunhill's pipe event. In his hand:
a large Honduran cigar.
<p>
With no Marlboro-type megabrand dominating the premium pipe market,
customers are scattered among nearly a dozen little-known pipe and
pipe-tobacco makers who are doing their best to manufacture their own
version of a cigar boom.
<p>
Peter Stokkebye International, the world's biggest seller of pipe tobacco,
has about a 6% share of the $80 million U.S. market. This year, the unit
of Sweden's STI SA plans to organize at least 30 Peter Stokkebye evenings
at tobacconist shops around the country. And in August, it launched a
single-malt scotch-flavored pipe tobacco, in homage to the drink most
often associated with premium cigars. "With so much being done for the
new cigar smoker, we thought it was time to do something for the pipe
smoker," explains Peter Stokkebye, grandson of the company's founder.
<p>
Also betting on a pipe renaissance is Swedish Match, one of the biggest
sellers of pipe tobacco in the U.S. According to William G. McClure III,
the Stockholm-based company's chief operating officer, the company
plans to boost its marketing budget and is eyeing some acquisitions and
new products. "We believe there is a future in this business," he says.
<p>
Certainly, there are few products more in need of a make over. According
to the Pipe Tobacco Council, sales of pipe tobacco are expected to
total 7.5 million pounds this year, a sevenfold decline from 1970.
Of the estimated 3 million pipe devotees left in this country, nearly
half of them are over the age of 46.
<p>
"Pipe tobacco has been the most steeply declining segment of the tobacco
industry," explains Norman Sharp, president of the pipe council, which
consists of himself and two assistants in a small Washington office.
"People who smoke pipes are perceived as being older and retired,"
he concedes. "It's something the elderly do."
<p>
But pipe makers insist that the smoke favored by Walter Cronkite, Gen.
Douglas MacArthur and Albert Einstein is poised for a major comeback
with young adults looking for a new way to flout health warnings.
Dunhill executives say sales of their pipes, which cost from $150
to $500 each, grew by double digits last year. Retailers Nat Sherman
International in New York and Georgetown Tobacco in Washington report
sharp sales increases for pipes as well. Sales of premium pipe maker
Savinelli Pipes Inc. in Morrisville, N.C., are up between 15% to 18%
this year. "In the past, we were lucky to get a 2% increase," says E.
Ruben Ysidron, chief executive.
<p>
Mark Grossich, owner of Beekman Bar and Books, the New York bar
that staged Dunhill's seminar, describes pipes as the next step for
trendsetters finished with their cigar phase. "As the cigar market expands
to the point of saturation, it just seemed to me the pipe is a natural
extension of that," he says.  "It offers many of the same pleasures."
<p>
Pipe proponents add that in the long run, pipes are far cheaper than
cigars, and their secondhand smoke smells a lot better. Fans also revel
in the colorful history of the pipe, which originated with the American
Indians and was later introduced to Europe by explorers returning from
the New World.
<p>
Cigar enthusiasts retort that pipes are too tweedy and prissy to compete
with a big, fat Havana. They point out that although cigars also were
saddled with the "old man" image, they were also symbols of good times
and celebration. And cigars' association with Wall Street bigwigs and
industrial moguls gives them a patina of macho power that pipes lack.
<p>
"Pipes were never symbols of power. They're more professorial," says
Charles Gill, defiantly puffing on his cigar during Dunhill's event.

<br>
A rekindled passion for pipe smoking takes hold
</center>
<p>
BYLINE: Cathy Hainer
<p>
Mark Twain. Albert Einstein. Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Pipe smokers
all. But pipes aren't just consigned to history. They're coming
out of tweedy men's clubs and heading into the hottest nightspots.
<p>
"The growing popularity of pipe smoking is coming off the popularity
of cigars," says Mark Grossich, co-owner of Beekman Bar and Books,
a New York City nightclub that recently held its first pipe smoking
night. "But cigars have played out a bit. I feel that the time
is ripe to reintroduce the joys of pipe smoking."
<p>
A sure sign that pipe smoking has re-entered the popular
consciousness:
a new magazine devoted to the subject, Pipes and Tobaccos,
a quarterly magazine out of Raleigh, N.C.
<p>
Editor Dayton Matlick has his own pet theory about why pipes are
smokin' hot. "People are looking for opportunities to smoke less
but to enjoy it more," he says.
<p>
"Cigarette smokers are more Type A personalities. They want a
quick hit. But pipe smokers are more Type B, meaning they're relaxed,
contemplative. Pipe smokers enjoy smoking the same way some people
enjoy meditating."
<p>
However, there's nothing mellow about pipe sales. Matlick reports
a recent survey by industry trade journal Tobacconist predicts
a 19.2% increase in pipe sales over the next two years.
<p>
Although cigars have fueled pipes' popularity, the two are powered
by different tobacco types. "Cigars are basically rolled up leaves,
there's no processing or flavors added, so there won't be as many
differences in the nuance of the smoke," explains Marc Perez,
buyer for 103-year-old tobacco purveyor Alfred Dunhill.
<p>
"Pipe tobacco is finely chopped and processed with essences,
like rum, cherry or vanilla, that create new combinations that
are enjoyable on the palate and through the nose."
<p>
Of course, not everyone will be thrilled by the return of the
professorial pipe -- health advocates, for example. The surgeon
general's office condemns all types of smoking.
<p>
But reporter Larry O'Connor addressed the issue recently in Pipes
and Tobacco by quoting a 1979 surgeon general's report.
<p>
"While cigarette smokers, particularly heavy smokers, have
substantially
higher mortality rates than nonsmokers, pipe smokers were shown
to have only slightly increased mortality rates over nonsmokers,"
O'Connor reports.
<p>
Indeed, at one time, pipes were a sign of vitality and wealth.
There are relief carvings of a Mayan deity smoking a pipe that
date to 1000, Matlick says.
<p>
Modern pipes come in just about every imaginable material: clay,
wood, glass, metal or stone. "Today, the typical tobacconist
carries pipes made of two materials, briar and meerschaum," Matlick
says.
<p>
"Briar is the ball-like growth under the white heath bush that
grows around the Mediterranean sea. Meerschaum (from the German
meaning sea foam) is a mineral, like a soft stone, that comes
primarily from Turkey."
<p>
Because meerschaum is soft, pipe craftsmen carve it into intricate
shapes. "Some pipes resemble faces, or mythological figures,
or dragons. Some have diamonds and jewels carved into them,"
Matlick says.
<p>
Pipes can cost anywhere from $100 to thousands of dollars for
gold-plated or diamond-encrusted types.
<p>
Fancy pipes are a return to a more glamorous era, Grossich says.
"Pipe smokers have always been thought of as a little bit aloof;
think of the university professor or the Hugh Hefner playboy type."
<p>
But, he says, that caricature is changing. "Younger people, in
their late 20s and 30s, are discovering that a nice pipe from
time to time is an enjoyable experience."
<p>
Will women take to pipes as they've taken to cigars? That remains
to be seen, Grossich says. "We've seen a few women smoking pipes,
but not many. But if you look back at the heritage of pipes, women
and pipe smoking goes back all the way to the 1600s. In fact,
some manufacturers used to actually market pipes for women."
<p>
In any case, the pipe phenom has moved past tweedy academics,
Grossich says.
<p>
"The image of the pipe smoker is expanding beyond whether someone
has patches on their elbows or not."

<title>What you need to smoke a pipe</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h1><center>What you need to smoke a pipe</center></h1>
Here is a (hopefully gentle) introduction to the things you'll need to
smoke a pipe.  Several objectives went into the advice given below.
<ol>
<li> The products must be economical.  If you find you don't
	like pipe smoking, there is no reason to spend big money to find out.
<li> The products must be widely available.  Not everyone lives near a
	tobacconist and must start by buying things at local stores.
<li> The products must be durable or cheap.  When one begins at anything, one
	tends to break things.
<li> The products must be easy to use.  Pipe smoking takes some
	practice to get right even under the best circumstances; there is
	no reason to complicate things.
</ol>

<h2>Pipe</h2>
	One thing to keep in mind no matter which type you pick: choose
	you like the look and feel of.  This adds to the enjoyment a great
	deal.

	<h3>Corncob</h3>
	<center>
	<IMG ALT="Corncob Pipe" SRC="beginners/corncob.new.jpg" HEIGHT=152 WIDTH=400>
	</center>
	A long-time favorite first pipe is the corncob.  It fits the
	parameters mentioned above as it is readily available, inexpensive
	(less than $5.00), durable as you can afford to buy more if one
	breaks, and easy to care for.  They are available in most drug
	stores and probably a better buy and a better smoke than a cheap
	briar pipe.

	<h3>Ceramic</h3>
	<center>
	<IMG ALT="Gouda Pipe" SRC="beginners/gtp.new.jpg" HEIGHT=229 WIDTH=400>
	</center>
	My personal favorite first pipe is a double-walled ceramic
	pipe from Gouda Tobacco Pipe.  Does anyone know where to mail
	order these?  I got this one from Thompsons.  There are a number of
	good things about this type of pipe:
	<ul>
	<li>	They are darn near indestructible.
	<li>	You can't scorch the top with your lighter.
	<li>	You can't foul the inside with your tobacco so you can
		try a bunch of different kinds of tobacco and not have
		the any of the tastes linger in your pipe.
	<li>	You get a cool dry smoke due to the double-wall.
	</ul>

	<h3>Briar</h3>
	This is where most people end up, but it might not be the best
	place to start.  There are more things to worry about with this
	type of pipe (for example, read about the cautions when cleaning,
	below), and many more types.  Briar takes more care than the two
	kinds above as you have to worry about keeping the pipe clean and
	breaking it in properly.  Briar pipes also should be rotated,
	so you'll need more than one if you plan on smoking more often
	than once every couple of days.

	Some generic recommendations:
	<ul>
	<li> I would recommend a 'second' pipe (one that doesn't make the cut
	to be best from a manufacturer) as there are some good deals to
	be found in this type.
	
	<li> There are two types of pipe surfaces: smooth and rough.
	The smooth is just as it sounds; the rough can either be
	sandblasted or carved.	Pipes are usually roughened to hide
	imperfections in the wood that could be very noticeable in a
	smooth pipe.  This is not necessarily bad: inexpensive smooth
	pipes can have putty fills to try and cover up these flaws.
	It is said the rough pipes also dissipate heat better.

	<li> There are two types of finishes on most pipes: varnish
	and wax.  Most people recommend that you buy a waxed pipe instead
	of a varnished one as this allows the pipe to 'breathe' better.
	However, I have smoked varnished pipes that are quite nice.

	<li>I would suggest that you purchase a 'bent' pipe instead of a
	'straight' one as this will reduce the possibility of ingesting
	any juices that might accumulate in the bowl.

	<li> Pipes with thick walls smoke better than pipes with thin
	walls, so look for this if you can.
	
	<li> It is generally recognized that paper filters don't do
	anything but get in the way, so look for a pipe that doesn't
	have them.  You can always removed them if you buy a pipe that
	is built for them.

	<li> To make it easier to break in a briar pipe, I recommend
	get a 'pre-carbonized' one for starters.  This greatly reduces
	the number of bowlfulls you must smoke in order to have a good
	tasting pipe.  Another possibility is get a meerschaum-lined
	briar pipe as these require no break-in.

	<li> I recommend getting a Lexan stem instead of vulcanite one.
	They require less care and aren't damaged as easily.
	Vulcanite is always a dark black; Lexan comes in many
	different colors, usually with a swirl pattern.
	</ul>

	(All right, now I'm going to go against a number of things I've
	said and make a recommendation: if you want to buy a briar,
	check out <a href="http://www.mja.net/nml/">Nikos Levin's</a>
	<a href="http://www.mja.net/NML/INTRO.HTM">introductory offer</a>.
	This will get you a good quality 'second' pipe and some good quality
	tobacco (I recommend the Viginia Woods).  They only have straights
	and the stems are vulcanite, they are not pre-carbonized, so it
	goes against what I've already said, but it's a great deal on a
	good pipe and tobacco...  They would make an excellent second
	pipe, if you decide you like pipe smoking, and you can mail
	order them so anyone can get them.)

<h2>Lighter</h2>
	<center>
	<IMG ALT="Lighters" SRC="beginners/lighters.new.jpg" HEIGHT=267 WIDTH=400>
	</center>
	Now that you have your pipe, you'll need some way to light it.
	Here are three methods:
	<ol>
	<li> Wooden matches.  These are the least expensive and
		probably the easiest to use.  Don't use paper matches as they
		taste terrible.  Allow the chemicals to burn off the end of
		the match before bringing it to your pipe.
	<li> Zippo pipe lighter (above right).  These are nice and simple and
		work well outside.  It's recommended that you allow the
		flame to burn for a second or two to remove the
		chemical taste.  Zippos and matches are both kind to
		the rim of briar pipes as they burn cooler than butane
		lighters
	<li> Butane lighters.  The best are the IMCOs as they have an
		angled flame, a window to view the fuel level, and are
		around $10 (above left).
	</ol>

<h2>Pipe Tool</h2>
	<center>
	<IMG ALT="Pipe Tool" SRC="beginners/pipetool.new.jpg" HEIGHT=222 WIDTH=400>
	</center>
	You'll need one of these to lightly tamp the burning tobacco
	from time to time and to loosen the left-over ash at the end.
	This one from Czechoslovakia is a good choice for about $2.00.
	There are also pipe 'nails' that look pretty much like a nail.
	For that matter, a nail with a large head works well too.

<h2>Pipe Cleaners</h2>
	I recommend you get the bristle kind as these are better at
	cleaning the stem.  Get a little brandy to dip your
	cleaner in.  After each smoke, run a brandy-soaked cleaner
	down the stem.  Don't remove the stem from a briar pipe until
	after the wood is completely cool or you will loosen the stem.
	Don't get the alcohol on a waxed briar pipe or you will damage
	the finish.  The alcohol can also remove the shine on a
	vulcanite stem.

<h2>Tobacco</h2>
	This is the first-order effect when it comes to taste; the type
	of pipe and everything else play a minor role in comparison.
	I would suggest you buy what smells good to you; this proves to be
	a good first-order approximation to the taste.	I suggest Captain
	Black Royal (in the royal blue pouch) or Amphora Blue as good
	first tobaccos.	Both are widely available and have mild flavors.
	There are so many kinds of tobacco available that it takes a
	lifetime to try them all (part of the appeal of pipe smoking!)

<h2>Lighting and Smoking</h2>
	Read the excellent <a href="how-to.html">how-to</a> guide on
	how to pack and light.  It takes some practice to keep a bowl
	going for any length of time; relax and have patience...  Most
	often, if the pipe goes out quickly, you've packed the bowl
	too tightly.  Beginners tend to smoke too fast, creating a hot bowl
	and an unpleasant smoke; a point of pipe smoking is to relax and
	enjoy the experience, so slow down if this happens to you.

<h2>Summary</h2>
	For the low-end, first-timer go with:
	<ol>
	<li> a corncob pipe,
	<li> wooden matches,
	<li> some cleaners,
	<li> a pipe tool or nail, and
	<li> Captain Black Royal,
	</ol>
	and walk away for under $15. If you think you're going to like it,
	move up to:
	<ol>
	<li> a ceramic pipe,
	<li> an IMCO pipe lighter,
	<li> some cleaners,
	<li> a pipe tool, and
	<li> Captain Black Royal.
	</ol>
	Swap the ceramic for a meerschaum-lined or pre-carbonized briar,
	and a Zippo for the IMCO if these are more your style.  You'll be
	$40 range for these.

		 ***********************************
		 * Welcome to the pipes mailgroup! *
		 ***********************************

Thanks for subscribing to the Pipes mailgroup! Digests are mailed out
as people submit things. (That varies from once a week to a bit less
often. But, the more you use the group, the more you'll get out of it,
so feel free anytime.)

If you have some unusual information or anecdotes of interest to the
Digest -- about tobacco, shops, books, or anything you think your
fellow pipeists would be interested in knowing -- please drop us a
line. Pipe collectors can use the group to buy, sell, barter, or find
information. Pipe carvers can find out about techniques, sources of
supplies, designs, etc.  People interested in cigars, tobacco
blending, or almost anything related can find compatriots here. If you
have questions to ask or anecdotes to tell, they're more than welcome.

Below are a few administrative points.


If you didn't want to receive the Digest:
-----------------------------------------

We try hard to send the Digest only to people who really want it.
However, occasionally someone makes a mistake. If your subscription is
in error, please mail me at the address below, and we will cancel the
subscription immediately. We apologize if this has happened.


Submissions:
------------

Submissions to the Digest should be emailed to the moderator.
(<a href="mailto:moderator@pipes.org">moderator@pipes.org</a>, or the address you received this from.) The
not-too-demanding preferred format for submissions is:

- Plain ASCII, Unix style (no carriage returns)
- Between 64 and 80 columns wide
- Left justified.

Other policies about submissions are listed below.


What to do if you have problems with the mail or Web:
-----------------------------------------------------

The Digest is sent as a single document in plain ASCII, limited to 80
columns.  It tends to be 50-100K long.  Occasionally, mailers have
trouble with documents of that length.  For obvious reasons, we can't
debug problems at the receiving end, or give advice on how to use your
site's mail reader(s) to read the Digest.

If a copy of the Digest gets torn up in the mail, let us know and
we'll send you another. However, if you're experiencing recurring
problems in reading the Digest, contact your site's postmaster
(variously known as the sysadmin, sysop, guru, etc.)  That's the
person who's most able to help you.

For problems with the Digest's Web site, contact the Webmaster
directly:

  Web site:	Steve Beaty (<a href="mailto:beaty@pipes.org">beaty@pipes.org</a>)


Resources:
----------

The Digest maintains a Resource Guide which contains lists of
smokeshops, mail-order places, clubs, other net resources, etc. Check
there for useful information, and feel free to add your favorite!

There is also a FAQ, a "How To" guide for new pipe smokers, and a
series of excerpts from the book, "101 Ways to Answer the Question,
'Will you Please Put Out that #(!&*!$ Cigar'," (Hague et. al., 1987.)

Back issues and most of the resource material are available on the
World-Wide Web:

	<a href="http://www.pipes.org/">http://www.pipes.org/</a>

or by FTP:

	ftp.netcom.com:brookfld/pipes_digest

Or mail your request to the moderator.

Thanks to Steve Beaty for setting up the Web page!


Cigars, etc.:
-------------

The Digest welcomes discussion of cigars, quality cigarettes, snuff,
Boer war cavalry tactics, etc. In fact, the Pipes Digest gets quite a
lot of cigar discussion (despite the name.) Feel free!


Subscription requests for yourself and friends:
-----------------------------------------------

Subscriptions by nonmembers will be mailed only to the originating
address (or trivial variants thereof). 

Current members of the mailgroup are welcome to request subscriptions
for friends. Nonmembers may only request subscriptions for themselves.


Address changes:
----------------

If your mailing address changes, please let me know, so that I can
continue sending you the Digests. Please send me both your OLD and NEW
addresses when you do this.

If you haven't received the Digest in the past month, please send
me mail, so that I can fix the problem. (If there is a problem;
sometimes, things just get slow.)

To keep the list from getting cluttered with non-working addresses, it
is the Digest's policy to drop subscribers if either (a) their mail
bounces twice in a row, or (b) their mail bounces with a "User
unknown" or equivalent error.  This policy is pretty standard for
mailing lists.


Flame policy:
-------------

One thing I've discovered is that everyone who smokes pipes, does so
for the pleasure and peace it brings. (Ever see a Pipe-enders clinic?)
I'd like everyone to feel as if they can smoke and chat among friends
here, just as if you were at home (or maybe in a more peaceful place :-9.  
So, to that end, antismoking rhetoric will be /dev/nulled, and flames
are to be used only for the purpose of lighting up. 'Nuff said?

So far, we've had few problems in that regard, though. Knock wood!
(Unless it's briar :-)


Advertising, "for-sale" notices, and commercial use policy:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to announce pipes, cigars, or other tobacco-related items or
services for sale or trade in the Digest. Such announcements will be
included in one issue.

Ongoing commercial concerns can be placed in the Resource Guide, and
in one issue of the Digest. However, the Digest is not a commercial
vehicle, and does not permit repeated advertising. 

Special events of interest to the members, such as sales, can also be
announced in the Digest. Please limit the length of these
announcements to 5-10 lines, and the frequency to twice a year or
less.

The Pipes Digest postings are copyrighted by the moderator. The Digest
may be freely distributed for any non-commercial use, as long as the
copyright notice remains intact. Commercial use of any part of the
material in the postings, including the names and email addresses of
the members, for any purpose whatever (including, but not limited to,
unsolicited advertising mailings) is expressly prohibited by the
policy of the Digest. 

Unsolicited advertising is also a violation of generally accepted
Internet etiquette, and of explicit usage rules at most sites.
Violation of this policy will result in removal from the list, and
also in whatever other disciplinary actions the moderator, and the
violator's site administrator, deem appropriate.  

The Digest also reserves the right to deny membership and Resource
Guide listings to any company, person, or organization which engages
in advertising by unsolicited electronic mail, excessive multiple
posting to newsgroups ("spamming"), or other such abusive practices.

In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the moderator will give
the benefit of the doubt to the complainant in such cases.  Please log
all requests for mailings if you maintain a mailing list for your
business.


Harassment:
-----------

Yes, it happens. 

>From time to time, some ignoramus tries to use the Digest to harass an
innocent person.  Usually, this harassment takes the form of a bogus
subscription request, with a nonsmoker as the victim. Other forms of
harassment have been tried; I'd rather not go into that here.

If you have been harassed by a bogus subscription, please mail me at
the address below. You'll be taken off the list immediately. If you
have been harassed in some other way, please keep all relevant mail,
and send me the details.

Anyone who uses the Digest for harassment will be referred to their
local system administrator for appropriate disciplinary action. We
support and actively protect the rights of both members and
nonmembers.


Anonymity:
----------

If you wish to submit an article anonymously, please put a note to
that effect at the start of every article you submit.  However, please
do not not post anything that you would not want to shout from the
rooftops.


Other Issues:
-------------

The moderator reserves the right to reject any articles which he feels
may put him, the poster, other members, or anyone else at legal risk,
or at risk of harassment.

<title>how-to</title>

<pre>
From: Steve Masticola (masticol@cs.rutgers.edu)
Subject: Pipe initialization and maintenance

There's really no big deal to lighting a pipe; it just takes some
practice. First, get yourself a quality pipe and some good tobacco.  I
like Petersons and GBDs; they're usually a good buy. Avoid pipes with
lacquer finishes, or with a lot of "fills" (putty applied to smooth
over surface defects). Rough-surfaced pipes are fine, though, and
usually cost a little less (and smoke cooler).  You should plan on
spending $30-50 for a decent pipe; smoke shops are usually willing to
bargain on price, and often have sales.  Look them over and buy the
one you like best; it's largely a matter of personal preference.

Amphora Regular, or a similar mild non-aromatic or light aromatic
Burley/Virginia blend, would be a reasonable tobak for a beginner.
Keep the package tightly sealed to keep it fresh. Experiment with
tobaccos until you find what you like. It helps to get a tobacco that
your wife or girlfriend likes, so get her input. If she doesn't like
pipes at all, get a new one of those, too. :-)

Also get a package of cleaners, a bottle of pipe sweetner, a LOT of
wooden matches :-), and a pipe tool with tamper, reamer, and scraper.
I have a neat little one made by GBD; it looks like a silhouette of a
pipe, and has wooden sides. It cost me about $12.

Now, to the matter of lighting. Pack the tobacco a bit at a time,
perhaps 1/3 of the bowl. You want to have it slightly springy, neither
loose nor tight. It should be easy to draw through. Use the reamer to
loosen it if it's too tight.

Light a match and hold it horizontally until the match completely
catches fire. Then hold it horizontally over the bowl, puffing and
moving the match in a circular motion over the tobacco until it is
alight. Avoid burning the edge of the bowl when you light up. After a
little while, the tobacco may go out. If so, tamp it down a little and
re-light. If there's a lot of ash in the bowl, empty it out without
knocking the pipe, then tamp and re-light.

You may find the pipe getting a little juicy as you smoke. To avoid
this, try to keep your mouth dry as you smoke, and avoid swallowing.
If it does get juicy, run a cleaner down it to clear it out. However,
don't take the stem off the pipe while it's still hot, as this will
eventually cause the stem to get loose.  (You can, however, take a
military-type push stem off a hot pipe; many Petersons and Savinellis
have this feature.)

Try to puff rhythmically. If the pipe gets too hot, or if your tongue
gets "bitten", slow down, or lay the pipe down and let it cool awhile
if necessary.  If the pipe goes out a lot, speed up. Before too long
you'll find a good rhythm.

Try to smoke your pipe all the way down, as long as it's pleasant.
This helps build up an even layer of "cake" (carbon) inside the bowl.
When you're done, clean all the dottle (ashes and unburned tobacco)
out of the bowl with the reamer. Avoid banging your pipe on the
ashtray, as this can make dents in the pipe. Put a cleaner in the
(cool) pipe until the next time you smoke it, to absorb any leftover
juice and help keep it clean.

"Break-in" refers to the initial carbonization of the bowl.  Many
pipes now come with pre-carbonized bowls and require no break-in. I'd
recommend such a pipe for a beginner.  However, it's desirable to
maintain a 1-2 millimeter layer of cake for a cool, even smoke.

If your pipe smokes sour or gurgles, if there's a lot of goo inside
the stem, or if the cake is very thick, it's time for a cleaning. This
usually will have to be done every 5-10 smokes. First, use the knife
blade of the pipe tool to scrape the cake to the proper thickness.
Then use the reamer to get any heavy goo out of the wood part of the
air hole of the stummel (the wood part of the pipe). Dip a cleaner in
the pipe sweetner, and run it through the stem; repeat with fresh
cleaners until they come out clean. Repeat with the stummel air hole;
be careful not to get any cleaner on the outside of the pipe, as this
harms the finish. After cleaning, let the pipe rest a few hours before
smoking it again, to give the sweetner a chance to dry out.

If you like smoking a pipe, why not get another? Or several? Most pipe
smokers have some kind of a collection, since we like variety, and
because pipes smoke better if they're given time to rest between
smokes. I have about 25, but I've been building my collection for
about 15 years. Make sure you've gotten to know the last pipe before
you buy the next one, so you don't wind up with a lot of new, unsmoked
pipes. It's OK to make mistakes; hardly anyone likes every pipe they
buy.

Lastly, enjoy! Don't smoke if you don't feel like it. It should be a
pleasurable pastime.

Perhaps (undoubtedly!) our other members will have things to add to
this. There are a million ways to smoke a pipe, all of them right. :-)
Let us know how it's going.

Until next time, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

			   Pipes Digest FAQ
	       Revision 1.0 (Last modified 5-April-94)

~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U ~\U

PIPE:   Narrow tube of clay, wood, etc. with bowl at one end for drawing in
smoke of tobacco. - Oxford English Dictionary

PIPE TYPES
----------

BRIAR:  This is the closely-grained burl joint between the stem and roots of
the White Heath, a tree found on the hillsides of mainly Mediterranean
countries. Underground, this burl protects the briar wood, which is tough,
close grained, porous, and nearly impervious to heat. Good briar is hard to
find. The larger shrubs take a long time to mature...and the older the
shrub the better the briar and thus your pipe. The most suitable root may
be 80 to 100 years old, and the finest pipe briar may be from a shrub over
200 years old... aged and mellowed by time. 

MEERSCHAUM: A German word meaning literally, "sea-foam," alluding to the
belief that it was the compressed whitecaps of waves. Meerschaum is a
mineral - hydrous silicate of magnesium - one of the most porous substances
found in nature. Composed of the fossilized shells of tiny sea creatures
that fell to the ocean floor millions of years ago, meerschaum is found in
red clay deposits. Meerschaum deposits of the highest quality are found
only in one place in the world - Eskishehir, in central Turkey.

AFRICAN BLOCK MEERSCHAUM comes from Tanzania, Africa and is usually stained
in varying shades of brown, black and yellow.

MISSOURI MEERSCHAUM: The All-American Corncob pipe. It is a length of
hollowed-out corncob, usually from a special hybrid variety of corn, with
a straight wooden stem and, sometimes, a inexpensive plastic mouthpiece.
Some veteran pipe smokers buy corncobs by the dozens, smoke one until it
burns out or goes sour, then throw it away and light up another. (If a
youngster uses yours to blow soap bubbles, buy another.)

CALABASH: A South African gourd similar to a squash grown specifically for
use in pipes. The shape is determined as the gourd grows by placing small
blocks under the stem, forcing it into a gentle curve. The mature gourd is
cut and dried, then fitted with a cork gasket to receive a meerschaum bowl.
The finished pipe offers one of the coolest, driest smokes available. 
Immortalized by Sherlock Holmes and in Jimmy Durante's signature line - 
"Good night Mrs. Calabash - wherever you are."

CLAY PIPE: Clay or pottery pipes were very popular in England and in Europe
before the discovery of briar. In London coffee houses and clubs,
long-stemmed "Church wardens" and "London Straws" were universally accepted.
The finest clay for pipes is said to be found in Devon, England.

HOOKAH: Also known as a WATER-PIPE or occasionally HUBBLY-BUBBLY. The
Turkish hookah filters the pipe smoke through water (or booz) for
extra coolness. Many styles of hookah exist including those with
multiple mouth pieces so that several may enjoy the tobacco (or
hashish) simultaneously.

The tobacco used in the hookah is usually dried whole leaf, soaked and
crumbled, or canned, mixed with various herbs and flavors. The very moist
tobacco is heaped into the bowl and covered with a small charcoal fire.

OPIUM PIPE: An Oriental water-pipe, normally made of brass with a very tiny
bowl used for smoking opium. Opium pipes are frequently seen with 12 or 18
inch long stems and fancy braiding.

CAST IRON: Normally used to carry natural gas.


PIPE PARTS:
-----------

BOWL: The part of the pipe that holds the tobacco.

HEEL: The base of the inside of the pipe bowl. 

SHANK: The part of the pipe that joins the bowl and the stem.

STEM: The part that connects the shank with the bit. 
Examine it carefully. Its quality, finish and fit will reveal the maker's
carelessness or attention to detail. 

BIT: The part of the pipe stem that fits in the mouth. Also called the
MOUTHPIECE. 

BITE-PROOF STEM: A bit designed with a solid center portion at the mouth to
prevent the "canine" tooth from punching a hole in it as readily as is done
in a standard bit. 

AMBEROID STEM: A fusion of Bakelite and pure amber - usually used with
meerschaum pipes.

BAKELITE STEM: Trade name for a synthetic resin widely used for lacquers
and varnishes and as a plastic.  A common material used for the stem,
especially of mass produced pipes. An alternative to vulcanite.

AMBER: brittle, feels like glass to the teeth - Usually used with
meerschaum pipes.

VULCANITE: A dark-colored variety of India rubber that has been subjected
to vulcanization : also called "hard rubber." A common material used for
the stem, especially of mass produced pipes. 

LUCITE: Trade name for a plastic. A common material used for the stem,
especially of mass produced pipes.  

HORN STEM: Animal horn - often found on inferior meerschaum pipes

BONE STEM: Animal bone - often found on inferior meerschaum pipes


PIPE ACCESSORIES:
-----------------

PIPE CLEANERS: Indispensable - two types - "soft and fluffy" to dry up
moisture or "thin and wiry" to dig out deposits.

LIQUID PIPE CLEANERS: Also called PIPE SWEETENERS, dissolve the gum and tar
while leaving a fresh aroma in the bowl, stem and mouthpiece. Frequently
featured in the "Dennis the Menace" comic strip.

SMOKERS COMPANION: Also called MULTI-PURPOSE PIPE TOOL, a spoon, a pick,
and a tamper in a metal holder. Usually built like a pocket knife, often
accompanied by a "knife blade reamer."

PIPE REAMER: A tool for smoothing out the "cake" and trimming it down to a
desired size. Reamers come in a variety of shapes and functionalities. 

PIPE RACK: A storage place for your pipes. To most enjoy pipe smoking one
needs several pipes to accommodate one's moods and activities.

HUMIDOR: A thing in which to store tobacco. Ideally - cheap and air-tight
(try Tupperware) - one places fresh tobacco in it and once sealed, it will
maintain the tobacco in a smokable consistency indefinitely. A major
alternate use of a humidor is the "re-moistening" of dried out tobacco.
For this action one adds a source of moisture to the tobacco in the humidor
before sealing. 


PIPE TERMS:
-----------

CAKE: A small layer of protective carbon allowed to form and remain in the
bowl of a briar pipe. The cake protects the briar from burning but too much
cake can split the pipe by causing uneven heating of the bowl.

DOTTLE: Unburned tobacco left in the heel of a pipe.
        
TONGUE BITE: Irritation of the tongue, usually caused by smoking
tobacco that is too wet, or by puffing too hard.

MYOB: Acronym for "mind your own business." Suggested rejoinder to
nasty antismokers who bother you for no conceivable reason.


PIPE FINISHES:
--------------

SANDBLAST: A finishing technique which leaves a rough surface.

FILLS: Places where a wood filler has been used to smooth over surface
defects. Generally regarded as lessening the pipe's value.

CARNAUBA WAX: A very hard wax, used to give pipes their finish.

STRAIGHT GRAIN: Refers to the wood grain in the briar.

BIRDSEYES: Small circles in the wood grain.


PIPE STYLES:
------------

APPLE: A pipe with a rounded bowl, in the shape of an apple.

BENT: A curved stem pipe.

BILLIARD: A common shape. Straight stem, slightly rounded vertical
bowl. 

BULLDOG: A pipe with a round bowl and a pointed heel and shank.

CANADIAN: An unbent pipe with a long shank and a straight vertical
bowl.

CHURCHWARDEN: A pipe with an extremely long stem.

DUBLIN: An Irish style, shaped after the clay pipe. Straight shank,
bowl leans forward slightly.

FREEHAND: Also known as DANISH FREEHAND. An asymmetric, one-of-a-kind shape.

OOM PAUL: A large-boweled bent stemmed pipe name for the Boer leader who
smoked this variety.

POKER: A cylindrical bowl and stem, without bend.

PRINCE: A squat, rounded bowl and a stem bent near the mouthpiece.

WOODSTOCK: The same as a DUBLIN with a slightly curved stem.


TOBACCO:
--------

TOBACCO: A member of the plant family "Solanaceae" which also includes
tomato  and potato plants. Around 40 kinds of tobacco exist. 

QUALITY: Tobacco is graded by leaf type and quality. There are five grades -
choice, fine, good, fair, and low. These are set by the tobacco's
uniformity, texture, age, oil, body, coloring,  etc.

NICOTIANA: The botanical name for tobacco after Jean Nicot who introduced
tobacco into Europe around 1560. 

RALEIGH, SIR WALTER: He popularized smoking at Queen Elizabeth's court
around the mid 16th century and was believed to be the first to smoke a
pipe in England. 

TOBAGO: Columbus discovered it in 1498, and according to legend, named it
after the shape of a Carib pipe smoked on the island.


Tobacco Cuts:
------------

FLAKE CUT: Tobacco packaged as large, flat flakes. Must be rubbed
out to separate the flakes.

RIBBON CUT: Tobacco cut into long, thin ribbons, though not as long or
as fine as SHAG.

CUBE CUT: Tobacco chopped into small square pieces.

SHAG: Tobacco which has been shredded very finely. Renowned as the
type of preference for Sherlock Holmes; at that time, shag was
considered an inferior grade.

RUBBING OUT: Separating tobacco pieces prior to smoking, by rubbing in
the palm of the hand. Must be done with FLAKE or PLUG cut tobaccos.

Basic blending tobaccos:
------------------------

VIRGINIA - red / black / lemon / orange / orange-red
The mildest of all blending tobaccos has the highest natural sugar content.
Used in virtually all blends as it is a good burner and aids in lighting.
It imparts a light sweet taste when used in moderation

BRIGHT  - From the Carolinas
BURLEY  - "white Burley" - a natural tobacco taste with a soft character
that will never "bite."

CAVENDISH - Cavendish is a process of curing and a method of cutting
tobacco leaf; the term does not refer to a tobacco, but a type of
manufacturing process. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the
natural sweet taste that is a characteristic of Virginia tobacco. This
process will create a tobacco very light in taste, quite mild and easy to
pack. Black - Traditional Navy Cavendish, aged naturally with dark
Jamaican rum .

"Taste" tobaccos:
-----------------

PERIQUE - From Louisiana
Havana  - From Cuba
Yenidji -

Oriental "spice" tobaccos:

LATAKIA - From Syria/Cyprus (richly smoked and fermented)
Latakia was "discovered" when a bumper crop resulted in surplus, and the
excess tobacco was stored in the rafters.  The  village farmers
traditionally used camel dung (or other dung, I suspect) as a source  of
fuel, and the smoke cured tobacco was revealed the following season.
Today, Latakia is smoked over a smoldering fire of aromatic herbs.  The 
camel no longer has to process the herbs first!

DUBEC   - From Turkey
XANTHI  - From Macedonia
KOMOTINI- From Macedonia
DRAMA   - From Macedonia
SERRES  - From Macedonia
SAMSUN  - From the southern coast of the black seas
IZMIR   - From Western Turkey


CIGARS
------

CIGAR: The Mayans are believed to be the first to put a cigar on the
pedestal it deserves. German philologists translated the Mayan noun
"Zik" for tobacco or smoke, and "zikar" the verb form. Thus the word
"cigar" evolved and was recognized in many ancient drawings and
carvings. A Myan carving dated circa 300A.D. depicts a long tubular
roll of tobacco in the mount of an obviously happy man.

BAND: A paper wrapper around the end of the cigar, originally meant to
protect white gloves from stains. Later used as a form of advertising.

CHURCHILL: A very large cigar, named for Winston Churchill, who
preferred big, expensive Havanas.

CLARO: A "clear" light brown wrapper, free of defects.

CUTTER: A device for clipping the end off a cigar. Some resemble
scissors with curved blades; others look like small guillotines for
making a straight or V-shaped notch. At least one variety looks like a
.44 magnum bullet, which pulls apart to reveal a punch that cuts a
round hole.

MADURO: A variety of cigars made with a dark wrapper.

EMS: European Market Selection

PYRAMID: A cigar shape with a pointed end.

RING GAUGE: Diameter of a cigar, in sixty-fourths of an inch.

SHADE GROWN: Wrapper leaf which has been grown under cotton shades,
for mildness.

TUBO: A cigar which is packaged in a glass or aluminum tube. Also called TUBED.

WRAPPER: The tobacco leaf used for the outer layer of the cigar.

INTERNET PIPES DIGEST CD-ROM PROJECT
CATALOG OF IMAGES

Last Updated: September 11, 1996

General Notes
-------------

All images have been marked with their source reference and catalog
ID.  I've tried to do this in such a way that the marks could be
easily edited out, if you're using the image elsewhere.  As a courtesy
to the providers, please retain the image credits somewhere if you do
so.

Scans have been minimally retouched, only where necessary to remove
extraneous noise.  I thought this was best, to allow interested
members to retouch the images as they saw fit, rather than to rely on
my retouching.  Also, the sheer number of images forbids extensive
retouching work.

All images are in black and white unless otherwise noted. Drawings and
high-contrast photos were scanned as 300 DPI bitmaps. Low-contrast
photographs were scanned as 100 DPI grayscale.

Black and white images are saved as GIFs. Color images are saved as
JPEGs with maximum quality.  This is to assure both portability and
good image quality.

Due to limitations of the GIF format, some images were converted to 72
DPI. This increases their size, but does not lose any information.

This catalog is not a comprehensive listing of all images in the
publications mentioned here.  Some images have been omitted because
they would not likely be of interest or use to the members, or because
they did not print well enough to be scanned.

Contributions are welcome.  Permission of the original source is
required.  Mail me at masticol@scr.siemens.com if you have an image to
contribute.


Notice to Parents
-----------------

Some images might not be suitable for young children.  When in doubt,
please exercise your parental responsibility.


Cataloging System

E = The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris
    Published by Tom Dunn (20-37 120th St., College Point, NY 11356 U.S.A.)

  En = Ephemeris, Book n. (E.g., E1, E2). This is used only when the
  scan is not otherwise in any issue of the Ephemeris.

  E<season><year> = Ephemeris issue. 
  W: winter, S: spring, S: summer, A: autumn, C: Christmas. For issues
  straddling year boundaries, the season and year are for the final
  date. Hopefully no ambiguities result. 

  Page number and index within the page noted next.
  E.g., ES78A11 is the first picture on page 11 of the Winter
  1977-Spring 1978 Ephemeris.

  SECOND-HAND SCIENCE:
  A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF ONE STUDY ON LUNG CANCER AND PASSIVE SMOKING.

  Robert Wagner (robert.wagner@channel1.com)    04/01/94

Summary:

A major study, published in JAMA, reached the conclusion "These results
provide support to the body of evidence linking passive smoking to lung
cancer ..". This analysis shows that the study did NOT properly justify
that conclusion. It does so thru a novel method of applying a test for
statistical significance, despite the fact the raw data were not
revealed in the report.

Introduction:

"Active and Passive Smoking and Pathological Indicators of Lung Cancer
Risk in an Autopsy Study", Trichopoulos et al., JAMA (Journal of the
American Medical Association):268:13:1697 (1992) contains two studies:
one on active smoking, which occupies the majority of the report, and
one on passive smoking. Since the Conclusion, as summarized in the
abstract, deals only with passive smoking, one questions the relevance
of the active study. This analysis deals only with the passive study.

The passive study was done on 30 women who had died from causes other
than lung disorders. Roughly 75% died from cardiovascular diseases and
25% were accident victims. Exact numbers were not given in the report,
nor are they particularly significant to this analysis. All the women
were non-smokers and over 35 years old. 17 were married to husbands who
were ever-smokers, 13 were married to husbands who had never smoked
(based on interviews with surrogates, in most cases the husband
himself). Autopsies measured Epithelial, Possibly Precancerous Lesions
(EPPL) in the subjects' lungs and expressed it on a numeric scale ranging
from 0 to 80+, the mean around 41, SE 5.6 (exact numbers not given).

The study divided the subjects into three groups: <40, 40 thru 60, >60.
It ignored the middle group, whose exact size is unknown. Based on other
data in the report (Table 2) it would appear the middle group comprised
at least 25%, thus the number of subjects (N) is approximately 20-22.

The report gives only three numeric facts about the subjects. One is not
useful for determining significance: the difference in EPPL between
passive and non-smokers is 27.88 (5.64 to 50.13) with a two-tailed P of
.02 (at 95% CI). The other two are:

..Number of subjects is less than 30.
..Odds ratio between passive and non-smokers is 6.

Analysis:

What we have is a classically simple four box matrix familar to
statistics students and certainly to epidemiologists:

                                     Exposed      Not exposed
        Have the disease             a            b
        Do not have the disease      c            d

Note that numbers are assigned to *classifications*. This is
significant. More familiar statistical analyses are presented with
continuous variables and asked to determine correlation between them.
Lacking evidence to the contrary they assume a normal distribution of
samples as well as the measurement error component: standard error (SE).
Based on that they do regression, T tests and other measures of
variance. None of those can be used on classifications.

Odds ratio is not a proper test for relationship, it is a measure of
effect size. First we must first establish that one variable is
dependent on the other: that exposure 'causes' the disease. Then we can
use odds ratio or relative risk to estimate how many individuals in the
population will be affected. Why? Because in any retrospective study
there is danger of a confounding factor which 'causes' both exposure and
disease. A likely confound in this case is socioeconomic status, which I
will analyze in a companion study. Although odds ratio gives a single
score, multiple tests with different randomly selected subjects would
give a range of scores, presumably with a normal distribution. In order
to establish dependence one must show that the spectrum does not cross
unity within the specified confidence interval (CI).

The test we will use is known as the chi square test for independence.
This is how it is computed, using one hypothetical set of data as an
example.

                                     Exposed      Not exposed
        Have the disease             6            1
        Do not have the disease      6            6

The odds ratio is (a/b) / (c/d), simplified to ad/cb. In this case: 36/6
= 6.  The more familiar relative risk (RR) would be (6/12) / (1/7) = 3.5.

To do a chi square test, first we add row and column totals, then use
them to compute the expected number in each cell -- (r * c) / N. For
example cell a is (12 * 7) / 19 = 4.4.

                                     Exposed      Not exposed  Total
                                     O    E       O    E
        Have the disease             6  4.4       1  2.6        7
        Do not have the disease      6  7.6       6  4.4       12
        Total                       12            7            19

Next we compute the difference between observed and expected, square
it, and divide by expected. The sum of the squares of the differences,
in relation to expected, is called x^2 (chi squared).

                             O      E    O - E    (O - E)^2 / E
a Have, exposed              6    4.4    1.6       .58
b Have, not exposed          1    2.6    1.6-      .98
c Do not have, exposed       6    7.6    1.6-      .34
d Do not have, not exposed   6    4.4    1.6       .58
  Total                                    x^2 =  2.48

Compuationally this can be simplified to:
   x2 = (((abs((a*d) - (b*c)))^2)*N) / ((a+b) * (c+d) * (a+c) * (b+d))

Finally we compare x^2 to a threshold obtained from a published table
called "percentage points, chi square distribution". The formula for
computing these values is rather complex and beyond the scope of this
analysis. In this case the value to use is 3.85 (CI=95%, df=1). If x^2
is below that value, we have not demonstrated a statistically
significant relationship between the two variables. In statistical
terminology "we accept the null hypothesis". If x^2 is above that value,
"we reject the null hypothesis" and conclude there is a relationship. In
the example one can see there is no causal connection.

In order to use this analysis on unknown data, I wrote a computer program
which tried all possible integer values in the four boxes, letting N (number
of subjects) range from 4 to 23, identifying those combinations yielding
an odds ratio of 6 (5.9 to 6.1). It found 106 sets meeting this criterion.
*Whatever data the report was based on had to be one of these 106.*
Here is a sample:

   a    b    c    d    N    OR     x^2
   4    2    4   12   22   6.0   3.275
   4    3    2    9   18   6.0   2.921
   4    4    1    6   15   6.0   2.142
   4    4    2   12   22   6.0   3.275
   4    6    1    9   20   6.0   2.400
   5    1    5    6   17   6.0   2.298
   5    3    3   11   22   6.1   3.709
   5    5    1    6   17   6.0   2.298
   6    1    1    1    9   6.0   1.148
   6    1    2    2   11   6.0   1.638

Result: ALL 106 FAILED THE CHI SQUARE TEST (the null hypothesis was
accepted).

The chi square test is an approximation which is usually satisfactory
when the numbers are large. When the counts are small, as they are
in this case, it is better to use Fisher's Exact Test, described
by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1970. The computationally demanding test
is given by the formula:

 P = (a+b)!(c+d)!(a+c)!(b+d)! / (N!a!b!c!d!)

One finds the smallest of the four variables and repeats the calculation
for each value down to zero. The sum of the results is the probability
of the observed deviation from expected. In order to show a
statistically significant dependence between the two variables, i.e. to
reject the null hypothesis, the sum must be less than .05 (CI=95%).
Applying this test to the 106 possible sets where N < 24, all failed
to show even 90% significance. Further, testing ALL possibilities of
N < 30, none of them showed 95% significance.

Conclusion: the data used in the Trichopoulos et al. study shows
no statistically significant relationship between passive smoking and
lung cancer. The study's conclusion is false.

  SECOND-HAND SCIENCE:
  LUNG CANCER AND PASSIVE SMOKING: AN ARTEFACT OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS

  Robert Wagner (robert.wagner@channel1.com)    04/01/94

Summary:

A major study, published in JAMA, reached the conclusion "These results
provide support to the body of evidence linking passive smoking to lung
cancer ..". My companion study showed that a direct, causal, relationship
was not statistically significant. This review hypothesizes that both
are related to a confounding factor: socioeconomic status.

Findings:

I first saw the relationship between socioeconomic (SE) status,
environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and health while reading
Schwartz-Bickenbach et al. The report's authors did not note the
connection.

The study measured cotinine level in infants. Cotinine is a derivative
of nicotine, which is found only in tobacco, thus a reliable measure of
exposure to and absorption of smoke. Findings for newborns was:

                            - Cotinine in infant -
Mother's status    cig/day    range     median
Smokers            < 20       41-430     91
                   >20        28-588    305

Non-smokers        none       0-7         0
 (father smokes)   passive    0-55        0

                  body weight (g)
Mother smokes     3165
Father smokes     3365
No smoke          3570

Body length and head circumference were essentially the same for all
categories.

Note that body weight correlates with parents' smoking status. Was lower
weight 'caused' by smoke? No. Where the father smoked and mother did
not, cotinine in the infant is insignificant. We know that cotinine can
cross the placental barrier because smoking mothers' newborns had it, and
in proportion to dosage. In another chart (not shown) they measured
cotinine in mothers' milk and found essentially the same: smoking
mothers had it in proportion to dosage; non-smoking mothers did not have
it, independent of whether fathers (or other household members) smoked.

How, then, did the father's smoking cause low birth weight?

For a likely answer let us now look at some findings quoted by Adler et al.:

Discussion:

Here we see clear correlations between education/SE status and health,
both physical and mental. We also see a negative correlation with
smoking. *Numerous* other studies have reported similar links between SE
and health. Adler et al. cites about 80. Other studies which we will
look at shortly cite another 50.

Few would argue that education 'causes' better health. Many see society
as a selection process which sorts out individuals who are naturally
'superior' by some measure -- intelligence, social skill, or
psychological well-being -- most likely a combination. In other words,
the same individuals would be as, or nearly as, healthy had they not
been educated or successful.

Others, primarily psychologists such as Adler et al., emphasize a link
with stress. Their thesis is that education and/or higher SE status
reduces psychological stress, depression, hostility and other negative
emotion. They then attempt to show a causal connection between
psychological health and physical health.

Some point to well established links between diet/exercise and health,
then show a correlation between SE status and diet/exercise. I subscribe
to that theory, but implicate other self-care behavior in addition to
diet and exercise. Low SE people make all sorts of bad decisions.
Individually the damages may be too subtle to measure; collectively they
could produce the health effects we see. In the case of cancer, possible
hazards are nutrition, cooking style -- fried food causes cancer
[Erasmus] -- failing to take precautions with chemicals, driving
defective automobiles, occupational exposure to carcinogens and, yes,
smoking.

Low SE people associate with and marry other low SE people. Those
associates smoke more than their high SE counterparts. Statistical tests
find a weak link between ETS and lung cancer. I hypothecate they would
find as strong a link with exposure to bowling, professional wrestling
or supermarket tabloids.

Was there a SE confound in Trichopoulos et al.? The authors say no:

"Adjustment for one or more of the other variables [confounds] ... had
no effect." [1699:col 2:para 2]

"Entering years of schooling and/or occupational groups into
the model did not noticeably affect the regression coefficients, nor was
there a substantial, significant, or suggestive association of EPPL with
any of the occupational groups.." [1699:col 1]

They did not adjust for SE as a covariant because they deemed its effect
insignificant. No regression coefficients are presented to support this,
although they are given for *every one* of the other suspected
confounds: age, gender, urban/rural and smoking habits (which showed no
correlation between EPPL and dosage). Following are EPPL scores by
occupational classification. If there were no correlation between EPPL
and occupation, ideally every classification would read exactly the same
as the overall mean. I added a 'goodness of fit' analysis to test
whether deviations from 50 are significant.

       Occupation        EPPL      SE (std err)  (O-E)^2/E
        Manual labor    55.18    6.23            .54
        Agricultural    54.00   13.15            .32
        Employees       42.53    3.79           1.12
        Commercial etc  40.15    5.96           1.94
        Housekeepers    41.22    5.84           1.54
                                                5.46  vs. 9.49 (df=4, 95%)
       SE status
        High (last 3)   41.66                   1.39
        Low  (first 2)  54.99                    .50
                                                1.89  vs. 3.84 (df=1, 95%)

The analysis says it IS possible for these readings to have come from a
population where every occupation's true mean is the same (had I not
excluded the small (N=5), anomalous (SE=22) Professional class, it would
have failed even this test). But x^2 = 5.46 is certainly not trivial. At
CI=80%, we would have a causal connection. It would be very interesting
to do a regression analysis between EPPL and a continuous variable such
as net worth. Unfortunately the data is not available.

Did the authors simply overlook the possibility of a SE confound?
Let us look at two earlier papers co-written by the report's own authors.

In 1989 Trichopoulos co-authored a paper which concluded that infant
mortality correlates with average income, not with access to doctors nor
hospitals. It goes beyond infant mortality to generalize: "The notion
that SE factors are strong determinants of the health status of the
corresponding populations and that social deprivation causes ill health
is at least a century old; inverse relationships between the SE status
of individuals and their risk of death have been extensively reported in
many studies. ... Other studies ... have shown that ... indices of
medical care ... are also related .. but these associations are usually
weaker, when compared to the former ones." It cites 39 other studies on
the SE confound, which the authors presumably read.

In 1991 Delsedime (a co-author of the JAMA report) co-authored a paper
dealing with survival of cancer patients. It found a correlation between
SE status and survival time. It went beyond cancer to generalize: "The
present report .. suggests the existence of inequalities in health
associated with patient SE status." It is worth noting that F Mollo, the
#2 author of the JAMA report, is mentioned in Acknowledgments. The
report cites 19 other studies on the SE confound.

Since two, or more likely three, of the JAMA authors were keenly aware
of the relationship between SE and health, having *written about its
importance* 3 and 1 years earlier, it seems remarkable that they brushed
it aside in this study. Especially when the numbers show a moderately
strong relationship.

Moreover, these numbers were for the larger (N=206) active study. We
know very little about the demographics of the 30 subjects in the
passive study. It is quite possible there was a bimodal distribution
between the 17 married to smokers and the 13 married to non-smokers.
Bimodal means having two peaks, like a camel. Since all the women had
living husbands, their average age would be less than the full sample.
That they all died before their husband is remarkable. In the full
population this happens only 20% of the time, here we have at least 50%
(30/62). The women were all non-smokers whereas 30% in the full sample
were non-smokers. Only 57% were married to smokers whereas >70% of the
male population (sampled here) were smokers. All of these indications,
taken together, suggest that observations about the larger group are
probably irrelevent to the passive group.

Also, there is a possibility of classification error -- that some of the
non-smokers were actually ex-smokers. It is quite believable that a
grieving husband might lie, forget or not know that his wife had smoked
20 years ago. Is the error not just as likely to apply to unexposed
wives? In this case I believe the errors are biased because low SE
people (smoking husbands) tend to equivocate more frequently than high
SE people. Also because smokers tend to marry other smokers; this is
called concordance bias. I will address these 'subject introduced'
biases in another study.

 "At a meeting of The International Council for Coordinating Cancer
  Research (ICCR) a speaker offered a remarkably candid history of
  the activities of the antismoking movement. He said that in the
  first phase of the movement the antismoking forces presented
  scientific evidence about the health effects of smoking in the
  belief that smokers would be rational and stop smoking. Some did,
  but many did not, so the antismoking movement adopted a second
  strategy: to frighten smokers and make them feel guilty by saying
  that they were stupid, short-sighted, and hedonistic. This
  increased the number of smokers who stopped smoking, but many
  continued to smoke. The third phase involved the "development of
  the ETS evidence" ..."where the attention shifted to an attack on
  smoke." A fourth strategy has been added, a direct attack on the
  "tobacco cartel." The speaker argued that the tobacco companies may
  compete for sales and profits but they act like a cartel in their
  defense against the attacks of the antismoking movement (Daynard
  1991). In these statements the author stated quite openly that the
  evidence on the health effects of ETS was consciously "developed"
  by the antismoking movement."

  Quoted from Bernhardt Lieberman, "What the controversies over the
  health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke tell us about
  the debates between objectivists and social constructionists.",
  available by gopher (veronica) from UManitoba and several other sites.
  This is a first-hand report, Lieberman was at the meeting.

We are now in phases 3 and 4.

Lieberman went on to say:

 "At the American Lung Association-American Thoracic Society 1991
  International Conference a session was held on the topic: Media
  Advocacy for Air Pollution and Tobacco control. The session was
  designed to teach the attendees how to use the media effectively to
  advocate the programs of the association. One speaker advocated the
  use of "creative epidemiology," which he left undefined. The term
  suggests fraud, and is similar to the half-humorous condemnatory
  terms, "creative accounting" and "creative statistics," which
  denote the improper manipulation of numbers. ... it is clear that
  members of the antismoking movement want to construct beliefs about
  the harmfulness of ETS and will use methods many consider
  illegitimate, but which they do not consider to be illegitimate, to
  construct those beliefs."

PN Lee writes in "Lung Cancer and Passive Smoking: Association an
Artefact Due to Misclassification of Smoking Habits", Toxicology
Letters, 35:157-162 (1987):

  1775 subjects were asked about their current use of tobacco products or
  nicotine chewing gum. 1537 provided a sample of saliva for cotinine
  analysis. Of 808 who claimed not to be users of such products, 20 (2.5%)
  had cotinine values above 30 ng/ml, suggesting their self-reports were
  false. In another study, 540 subjects were interviewed on two occasions.
  10% [an average between 7.2% to 12.6%, depending on interpretation] of
  the subjects claiming on one occasion never to have smoked made
  inconsistent statements on the other occasion. A third study showed a
  strong tendency for smokers to marry smokers.

  In the context of passive smoking, misclassification of current or
  ex-smokers as never-smokers, coupled with a tendency for smokers to be
  married to smokers ('concordance'), can create an apparent positive
  effect of passive smoking when no effect exists. This can be seen in
  Table I, where a 5% misclassification rate leads to a spurious excess
  risk of lung cancer in relation to spouse smoking of 44%

                          TABLE 1
   Hypothetical Example of Bias Due to Misclassification of 5% of
   Smoking Subjects as Non-Smokers.

   NS         Total   100  1     100+5=105  1.90

-End of quote -

Of the *numerous* studies, a finding of RR 1.44 is fairly
representative, actually a little high. The two big ones (with highest
power) both found 1.2, as did the EPA's meta-analysis.

Wouldn't it be ironic if they were actually measuring peoples'
propensity to lie rather than the effect of smoke? Ironic isn't the
right word, make that 'fitting'.

The most important thing to note here is that all of the CI's cross
unity, most by a wide margin. The EPA managed to overcome that by
combining them and lowering CI from 95% to 90% (the first time they'd
ever done that). Had they not excluded the two studies they did, even
the meta-analysis would have been inconclusive. The Stockwell study was
certainly a Major one and has the appearance of quality. It was
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, Dept of Health and Human
Services.

As it is, the EPA meta-analysis is just *barely* significant (assuming
one regards RR as a test of significance, which it really isn't).
Most use RR > 1.2 as a rule of thumb to discount unrecognized bias.
Some use 1.5 or even 2.0 because when there IS a connection the ratio
is typically around 6-10 or or more.

In this case, each of the 13 studies failed to show significance on
its own. Even after lowering the CI to 90%, we still have 12/13 failing
to show significance. The solution: combine 11 of them to get
'CIs' which barely squeak over the line (1.04).

Combining studies into a meta-analysis *is* a valid technique, but only
when the studies are similar. Stein denigrated the combination of
heterogeneous studies as a "computational exercise". Fleiss has written
extensively on the criteria for combinability. An excellent in-depth
discussion is in:

Epidemiol:44:2:127-139 (1991).

Let's look at one of the reports the EPA threw out: "Environmental
Tobacco Smoke and Lung Cancer Risk in Nonsmoking Women", Stockwell et
al, J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992;84:18:1417-1421. If finds a 2.4 Odds Ratio
in women who reported > 40 years of exposure in adulthood or > 22 years
in childhood and adolescence. It says "We found no statistically
significant increase in risk associated with exposure to ETS at work or
during social activities." (I believe that one Politically Incorrect
sentence is the reason it was rejected by the EPA). Nor did it find any
correlation in adult exposure less than 40 years. It cites several other
studies including this: "A study of lifetime nonsmoking women in Hong
Kong by Koo et al showed that exposure to ETS was associated with
elevated risk of squamous cell and large-cell carcinomas."

Ok, let's look at "Measurements of Passive Smoking and Estimates of Lung
Cancer Risk Among Non-smoking Chinese Females", Koo et al, Int. J.
Cancer, 1987;39:162-169. It is an interesting read. Contrary to the cite
it concludes "In our analysis of *all* never-smoked cases, the lack of a
dose-response pattern, and an almost consistent drop in RR at the
highest doses of exposure would seem to lead little, or only weak
support for the passive smoking linkage with lung cancer ... the effects
of passive smoking might be so weak that they are easily overshadowed by
other environmental factors such as diet or exposure to inhaled
gaseous/particulate matter from other sources."

Quite a difference from Stockwell's characterization, eh? Typical
findings in the Koo study look like this:

Cig/day by husband:                    Adjusted RR
0                                             1.00
1-10                                          2.33
11-20                                         1.74
21+                                           1.19

By period of life:
No exposure                                   1.00
Childhood only                                2.07
Adulthood only                                1.68
Both childhood and adulthood                  0.64 !

Mean hours of exposure per day (>25 years)
< 1.5                                         1.47
> 1.5                                         1.07

These are not atypical. Other studies have found the same inverse
relationship to dosage.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Let us look at another contradiction. The potentiating effect between
air pollution and smoke wrt lung cancer was first described in a major
paper co-authored by Trichopoulos himself: "A Case-Control Study of Air
Pollution and Tobacco Smoking in Lung Cancer among Women in Athens",
Katsouyanni, Trichopoulos, et al. Preventive Medicine:20:271. It
concluded: "This study indicates that air pollution is probably
unrelated to lung cancer among nonsmokers but .. among smokers air
pollution may have an interactive effect. " It found RR=1.35 for 15
years smoking and 2.23 for 30 years.

That was in 1991. In 1992 Trichopoulos wrote (in the JAMA report) "The
present data cannot substantiate or challenge the notion that air
pollution, of the type and levels present in Athens, is an important
determinant of EPPL .. the results of the present investigation do not
deviate from the "negative" evidence generated by other
pathology-focused studies that have attempted to examine the effect of
general air pollution on lung cancer risk, and *cannot facilitate the
resolution of this important and controversial issue*."

A remarkable tergiversation in only one year's time. :-)

                    HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT SUBCOMMITTEE
                   STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS J. BLILEY, JR.
                                JULY 21, 1993


        Mr. Chairman, I am testifying today in order to report to the 
Subcommittee the results of my extensive investigation of the EPA's handling 
of the controversy surrounding environmental tobacco smoke or "ETS".  As you 
know, in the past the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of this 
Committee has conducted hearings on EPA's abuses of government contracting 
requirements.  So pervasive is the level of abuse that Chairman Dingell has 
characterized EPA's pattern of contract mismanagement as a "cesspool".  EPA's 
Inspector General recently has confirmed that such abuses also have taken 
place in connection with a number of EPA contracts involving ETS, and the O 
and I Subcommittee's own investigation is continuing.

     In addition to various contractual improprieties, however, my own 
investigation suggests that in its consideration of ETS, the Agency has 
deliberately abused and manipulated the scientific data in order to reach a 
predetermined, politically motivated result.  EPA's risk assessment on ETS 
released in January of this year claims that ETS exposure is responsible for 
approximately 3,000 lung cancer cases per year in the United States.  
Analysis of the risk assessment reveals, however, that EPA was able to reach 
that conclusion only by ignoring or discounting major studies, and by 
deviating from generally accepted scientific standards.

     EPA's willingness to distort the science in order to justify its 
classification of ETS as a "Group A" or "known human" carcinogen seems to 
stem from the Agency's determination early on to advocate smoking bans and 
restrictions as a socially desirable goal.  EPA began promoting such policies 
in the mid-to late 1980s, ostensibly as part of its efforts to provide 
information to the public on indoor air quality issues.  The Agency then 
decided to develop the ETS risk assessment to provide a scientific 
justification for smoking bans.  The risk assessment thus was never intended 
to be a neutral review and analysis of the ETS science. Rather, it was 
intended from the start to function as a prop for the Agency's predetermined 
policy.

     Not surprisingly, therefore, the process at every turn has been 
characterized by both scientific and procedural irregularities.  In addition 
to the contracting violations mentioned at the outset, those irregularities 
include conflicts of interest by both Agency staff involved in preparation of 
the risk assessment and the members of the Science Advisory Board panel 
selected to provide a supposedly independent evaluation of the document.  I 
will not itemize each and every one of these improprieties.  Instead, I ask 
consent that a memorandum providing full details of the history of EPA's 
handling of ETS be included in the record.  The memorandum summarizes the 
results thus far of my investigation into the Agency's handling of ETS and is 
based on publicly available documents, extensive correspondence between 
myself and former Administrator Reilly, and interviews conducted by my staff 
with the responsible EPA officials.

     The ETS risk assessment is far from an isolated example of EPA's 
approach to the use of science in policy making.  The Agency's propensity to 
scare the public first and ask scientific questions later is both notorious 
and well-documented.  Alar, dioxin and the removal of asbestos from schools 
are other examples.  In fact, concern that EPA's pursuit of media headlines 
rather than good science was undermining the Agency's credibility caused 
former Administrator Reilly to convene an expert panel in early 1991 to 
assess EPA's use of science.  The expert panel issued a report in March 1992 
entitled "Safeguarding the Future:  Credible Science, Credible Decisions."  
The report states that "[c]urrently, EPA science is of uneven quality and the 
Agency's policies and regulations are frequently perceived as lacking a 
strong scientific foundation."  The expert panel also cautioned EPA, in terms 
that are directly relevant to the Agency's work on ETS, that "science should 
never by adjusted to fit policy, either consciously or unconsciously."  
Unfortunately, in the case of ETS there appears to have been a conscious 
misuse of science and the scientific process to achieve a political agenda 
that could not otherwise be justified.

     EPA betrays its own lack of confidence in its tortured statistics by
refusing to incorporate the results of the ETS-lung cancer study by Brownson
and coworkers.  The Brownson study, one of the largest and best designed
studies ever conducted, was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute.
The study looked at exposure to ETS in a variety of settings, at home, at work
and in social environments.  The study reported no significant association
between ETS and lung cancer among nonsmokers in spousal or work settings or
from childhood.  Even using the highly questionable statistical methods adopted
by EPA in the ETS risk assessment, inclusion of the Brownson study would show
no significant risk of lung cancer from exposure to ETS.

     Evidently, publication of the Brownson study caused no small degree of 
consternation at EPA.  In order to avoid incorporation of the Brownson 
study's results into the risk assessment and invalidating EPA's claim that 
the epidemiology shows a significant risk, EPA rushed to issue the final 
report in early January.  Mr. Chairman, given this sort of behavior, in my 
judgment we must be very cautious about allowing scientific pronouncements 
from EPA to drive public policy decisions.

                        EPA AND ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO
                         SMOKE: SCIENCE OR POLITICS?



I.   INTRODUCTION

                With almost unprecedented fanfare, the Environmental 
Protection Agency ("EPA") released at a news conference on January 7, 1993, 
a risk assessment on tobacco smoke in the air -- often referred to as 
environmental tobacco smoke ("ETS").  According to the EPA risk assessment, 
ETS is a "Group A" or "known human" carcinogen that is responsible each year 
for approximately 3,000 cases of lung cancer among nonsmokers residing in the 
United States.  The risk assessment also claims that ETS is a cause of 
respiratory problems in infants living in homes in which one or both parents 
or some other family member smokes.
                      
                Not surprisingly, the claims contained in EPA's risk 
assessment on ETS generated substantial publicity, with most major 
newspapers, television news program and radio stations devoting substantial 
attention to EPA's conclusions.  The publicity was, in part, a natural and 
expected response to the rather dramatic claims made in the EPA report.  But 
EPA officials and staff, joined by Secretary Sullivan of the Department of 
Health snd Human Services ("HHS"), also left no stone unturned to ensure 
heavy media coverage of the report. The EPA/HHS campaign was seeded by 
periodic "leaks" of drafts of the report, and those leaks were followed with 
a heavily promoted press conference and individual interviews.
           
                The EPA/HHS representatives made clear at their January press 
conference that they hoped that the EPA report would lead to additional 
smoking restrictions by private entities as well as by government at all 
levels.  If the conclusions of the report are valid, that hope is certainly 
understandable.  At the same time, however, if the claims made in the report 
are invalid, as appears to be the case, the likely consequence will be 
additional unjustified harassment of and discrimination against smokers -- a 
consequence that received little attention at the January press conference.
           
                The assumption that often is made is that smoking 
restrictions and other comparable measures are essentially costless.  
Increasingly, that assumption has been shown to be incorrect.  Whether 
measured in terms of the number of people who are fired or are not hired 
because they smoke, by unjustified feelings of guilt among smokers or by the 
erosion of courtesy and tolerance, the campaign against smoking is not the 
no-lose proposition it often is portrayed as being.
           
                In Washington, D.C., for example, which has adopted workplace 
smoking restrictions, the consequences of the ETS controversy are 
unmistakable.  At all hours of the working day, people can be seen, even in 
the middle of winter, huddled near the doorways of office buildings smoking 
cigarettes.  In fact, some employers -- in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere -- 
have gone so far as to require current and prospective employees to submit to 
a urine test, looking for the telltale sign of nicotine.
           
                Over the past several years there has been increasing 
concern about the politicization of science and other problems at EPA.  A 
two-year investigation by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of 
the House Energy and Commerce Committee has uncovered disturbing evidence 
encompassing everything from cronyism in the award of government contracts to 
systematic bias in the collection, review and presentation of scientific 
data.  Instead of evaluating scientific issues objectively and providing 
balanced information to the public, EPA has been found on a number of 
occasions to have manipulated or suppressed data in a manner that has 
resulted in unnecessary alarm and confusion.
           
                Mounting concern about EPA's misuse of science prompted 
former EPA Administrator William Reilly to convene an expert panel in 1991 to 
review EPA's handling of scientific issues and to recommend improvements.  
The expert panel, which was comprised of eminent scientists from leading 
institutions across the country, issued a report in March 1992 entitled 
"Safeguarding the Future: Credible Science, Credible Decisions."  The report 
confirmed that, "[c]urrently, EPA science is of uneven quality, and the 
Agency's policies and regulations are frequently perceived as lacking a 
strong scientific foundation" (p. 4).
 
                The expert panel also cautioned EPA that "science should 
never be adjusted to fit policy, either consciously or unconsciously" 
(p. 38).  Unfortunately, that is precisely what appears to have happened in 
the case of the risk assessment on ETS -- the abuse of science and the 
scientific process to further a political agenda.  However one views 
cigarettes and smoking, EPA's misuse of science and disregard for proper 
legal and scientific procedures should be cause for alarm.  In fact, EPA's 
handling of ETS sets a disturbing precedent for the Agency's consideration of 
future controversial scientific questions, raising questions about EPA's 
ability to separate science from politics in carrying out its mission.
           
                As the editor of "EPA Watch" recently observed in response to 
EPA's release of the ETS report:
 
                It's now open season on whatever contam-
                inant the EPA chooses to label the killer
                contaminant of the week, with the effect
                that once again, Americans are going to be
                stampeded into fearing a substance for
                reasons which upon close inspection are
                scientifically indefensible.(1)

                The discussion that follows describes EPA's activities with 
respect to ETS -- the procedures the Agency has utilized and the problems 
that have infected the process from the beginning.


II.  THE HISTORY OF EPA'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE ETS CONTROVERSY

     A.  Putting EPA's Role Into Context

          In order to understand EPA's role in the ETS controversy, one must 
understand how the "passive smoking" issue emerged in the first place.  
According to Richard Daynard, a well-known antismoking activist, the 
organized movement to eradicate smoking has proceeded in three distinct 
phases.(2)  During the first phase, activists attempted to persuade smokers 
to stop smoking on the ground that smoking was bad for the smoker.  Although 
many smokers did stop smoking for that reason, others continued.  During the 
second phase, activists attempted to make smokers feel guilty about their 
enjoyment of smoking.  Again, however, many individuals continued to smoke.  
The third and current phase, according to Daynard, marked a more fundamental 
strategic shift.  In this phase, the movement began to focus on the 
"development" of "evidence" about ETS.  If people can be persuaded to believe 
that tobacco smoke is harmful to nonsmokers, it becomes easier to persuade 
both private entities and government authorities to restrict or ban smoking.  
According to Stanton Glantz, founder of Californians for Nonsmokers' Rights 
(later christened Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights), the target of such laws 
is the smoker rather than the nonsmoker.  "Although the nonsmokers' rights 
movement concentrates on protecting the nonsmoker rather than on urging the 
smoker to quit for his or her own benefit, [antismoking legislation] reduces 
smoking because it undercuts the social support network for smoking by 
implicitly defining smoking as an antisocial act."(3)
          
                 Neutral and dispassionate scientific inquiry often yields 
inconvenient results from the perspective of the social activist.  So it has 
been for EPA with Alar, PCBs and dioxin, to cite only a few examples.  ETS 
must now be added to the list.
           
                The scientific data simply do not support EPA's 
classification of ETS as a "Group A" carcinogen.  Of the more than 30 
epidemiologic studies of marriage to a smoker and lung cancer among 
nonsmokers, the overwhelming majority report no statistically significant 
association.  The studies focusing on ETS exposure in the workplace also 
generally have not reported a statistically significant increased risk.  The 
most recent and largest U.S. case control study, by Brownson and coworkers, 
confirms the general no-association pattern.(4)  Although the Brownson study 
was published in November 1992, two months before EPA completed its report on 
ETS, the EPA report failed even to cite the Brownson study.  The reason, 
undoubtedly, is that EPA's conclusions on lung cancer could not survive 
inclusion of the Brownson data.
           
                Even without the Brownson data, the classification of ETS as 
a Group A carcinogen required substantial stretching by EPA.  To reach that 
conclusion, the EPA report combined eleven spousal smoking studies from the 
United States in a so-called "meta-analysis."  Of the eleven studies, 
however, ten reported no statistically significant increase in cancer among
nonsmokers purportedly exposed to ETS.  To ensure that the meta-analysis 
would produce the desired results, therefore, EPA had no choice but to 
manipulate the numbers.
           
                Although in the past EPA and the scientific community  have 
used a 95% confidence interval as a means of ensuring that study results did 
not occur by chance, EPA adjusted the confidence interval downward -- to 
90% -- in its report on ETS.  As James Enstrom, an epidemiology professor at 
the University of California, Los Angeles, explained, "[t]hat doubles the 
chance of being wrong."(5)  To put it in lay terms, EPA's statistical 
maneuvering is the equivalent of moving the goal lines at a football game in 
order to score more touchdowns.  The implications of EPA's willingness to 
lower scientific standards in selected cases are profoundly troubling.  As 
Michael Gough of Congress's Office of Technology Assessment has pointed out, 
"[y]ou cannot run science with the government changing the rules all the 
time."(6)
           
                The only claim made in the EPA report for which there is at 
least statistical support is that ETS can affect the respiratory health of 
very young children.  Most of the studies on that issue are so flawed, 
however, that it is premature to conclude that the association is causal in 
nature.  In the final analysis, it must be remembered that epidemiologic 
studies can show only a statistical association.  They cannot prove 
causality.  After all, there is a strong association between increased life 
expectancy and increased consumption ofjunk food in affluent countries but no 
one contends that one is the cause of the other.  In fact, many argue the 
converse.(7)
 
                In light of the weaknesses in the pertinent data, the 
procedures that have been utilized in "developing the case against ETS" take 
on a special significance.  As one of the world's leading epidemiologists, 
Dr. Alvan Feinstein of Yale University Medical School, put it in a recent 
article:
 
                In the investigations of [ETS], * * * the
                various studies are contradictory, some
                going in positive directions and others
                not.  The inconvenient failure of the
                evidence to comply with a prime requisite
                of scientific reasoning for causality,
                however, has not inhibited the causal
                accusations.  The "prosecution" has simply
                ignored the inconvenient results and
                emphasized those that are (in a memorable
                term) "helpful."(8)
          
                A report produced by the Advocacy Institute, a major
antismoking organization, entitled "Media Strategies for Smoking Control: 
Guidelines" (NIH 1989), provides a striking illustration of this strategy.  
Behind every story detailing the "risks" of ETS, the report stated, could be 
found "[a] scientist wise in the way of 'creative epidemiology,' i.e., the 
presentation of data -- both scientifically sound and artful -- so as to 
catch the glint of media attention * * *" (NIH Report at 7).  The report 
describes "creative epidemiology" as follows:
 
                Michael Daube, who coined the term,
                defines creative epidemiology as "the
                ability of the good epidemiologist to
                rework data so that what is essentially
                the same information can be presented in a
                new and interesting form."  Thus creative
                epidemiology marries the science of the
                researcher with the art and creativity of
                the media advocate (id. at 21-22).
          
                Similarly, Jonathan Samet of the University of New Mexico 
recently acknowledged that there is much that we do not know and indeed may 
never know about whether ETS poses a health risk.  Notwithstanding those 
evidentiary deficiencies, however, Dr. Samet made clear that "[i]n the case 
of environmental tobacco smoke, it would be unfortunate if potentially 
irresolvable scientific uncertainties thwarted control."(9)
          
                As a result of this strategy, there is enormous pressure on 
researchers and scientific bodies investigating ETS to come up with the 
"right" conclusion.  The Brownson study, for example, apparently caused 
considerable dismay because it produced the "wrong" results.  Defending his 
decision to publish the study, Dr. Brownson lamented, "I wish our findings 
had gone in the exact pattern the public health community would like * * *.  
But one of the criticisms of medical research is that the only thing findings 
ever show is some kind of health risk.  I feel it's important to publish 
findings, no matter what they show."(10)  Dr. Brownson's eagerness to please 
the public health community is widely shared.  His willingness to release 
data not in accord with the political objectives of that community 
unfortunately is not.
 
                Again, Dr. Feinstein of Yale has offered a revealing insight.  
According to Dr. Feinstein:
 
                [I]n the current fervor of anti-smoking
                evangelism, what young scientists would
                want to risk their career and what older
                scientists would want to risk their
                reputation by doing anything that might be
                construed as support for the "bad guys" of
                the tobacco industry?  What governmental
                agency would fund research in which the
                established "accepted" anti-smoking
                doctrines were threatened by a study
                proposed by someone -- an obviously
                deranged skeptic -- who wanted to do an
                unbiased, objective investigation?
                (p. 304).

In the same article, Dr. Feinstein revealed that he "recently [had] heard an 
authoritative leader in the world of public health epidemiology make the 
following statement:  "Yes, it's rotten science, but it's in a worthy cause.  
It will help us get rid of cigarettes and become a smoke-free society" 
(p. 303).
           
                Because the debate over ETS has been caught up in the larger, 
highly emotional controversy about active smoking, the role of EPA in 
collecting, evaluating and disseminating scientific information about ETS 
becomes even more important. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act 
of 1986 ("SARA") gave EPA the role of "providing information and guidance" to 
the public on indoor air and radon.  42 U.S.C. Sec. 7401 note.  SARA required 
EPA's research agenda to be reviewed by the Agency's independent Science 
Advisory Board ("SAB").  The SAB consists of scientists from outside EPA 
whose role is to assess the factual and theoretical bases for EPA's research 
and reports.  The SAB is supposed to operate as a check on the Agency's use 
of science in the formulation of regulatory policy -- to ensure that 
objective scientific inquiry is not subverted to serve political rather than 
scientific ends.  Unfortunately, the SAB has not operated as intended in the 
case of ETS.  As a result, there has been little or no brake on the 
antismoking proclivities of individual EPA staff members.
        
        B.   Early EPA Staff Initiatives Concerning ETS

                EPA's policy of promoting restrictions on smoking seems to 
have begun with James L. Repace, an "environmental protection specialist" in 
EPA's Indoor Air Division.  In 1980, even before the first major ETS health 
claims appeared in the scientific literature, Repace wrote with A.H. Lowrey 
an article reporting on particulate matter in the air of various environments 
such as bars, restaurants and bingo parlors, without distinguishing whether 
those particulates were from ETS or some other substance or activity.(11)  
The only "office" measurements made by Repace were in an experimental, 
enclosed room in which thirty-two cigarettes were smoked in less than one 
hour, generating ETS levels grossly in excess of those encountered in the 
real world.  Subsequent research has discredited both the methodology and 
concluslons of the 1980 Repace study.(12)  On the basis of these 
observations, however, the article claimed that "indoor air pollution from 
tobacco smoke presents a serious risk to the health of nonsmokers * * * 
[that] deserves as much attention as outdoor air pollution."(13)
           
                A few years later, Repace published (again with A.H. Lowrey) 
an article purporting to show that ETS was riskier than "all regulated 
industrial emissions combined."(14)  This second article by Repace and 
Lowrey, which represented a crude attempt at quantitative risk assessment, 
has been roundly criticized by both government and private sector 
scientists.(15)
           
                Repace's extensive work with political advocacy organizations 
such as the Group Against Smoke Pollution ("GASP") and Action on Smoking and 
Health ("ASH") and his private and professional focus on smoking raise 
questions about Mr. Repace's ability to evaluate indoor air issues in a 
balanced manner.  Since the 1970s, Mr. Repace also has been appearing as a 
paid witness in numerous lawsuits and testifying before various legislative 
bodies to support governmental restrictions on smoking.  Consider in this 
regard Mr. Repace's statements to the press in reaction to the defeat of an 
antismoking legislative proposal in Maryland:
 
                People aren't going to stand for this.
                Now that the facts are clear, you're going
                to start seeing nonsmokers becoming a lot
                more violent.  You're going to see fights
                breaking out all over.  Washington Star,
                April 5, 1980, p. D-l.
          
                Based on my own experiences with Mr. Repace, I do not find 
these accounts surprising.  In 1991, at the invitation of EPA Administrator 
Reilly, my staff interviewed several EPA employees as part of my and the 
Oversight Committee's efforts to gather the facts about EPA's procedures in 
preparing ETS-related documents.  When he presented himself in my office, 
however, Mr. Repace categorically refused to answer any questions.  He was 
accompanied by John Banzhaf, ASH's Executive Director, and Mr. Nantkes of the 
EPA General Counsel's office.  Both were said to be serving as Mr. Repace's 
attorneys.  Within minutes after Mr. Repace left my office, my staff received 
inquiries from the media characterizing my efforts as "intimidation."  

                During the late 1980s, Mr. Repace became the driving force 
behind EPA's push to classify ETS as a "Group A" carcinogen.  He began by 
outlining plans for two reports designed to promote the elimination of ETS.  
Although his plans personally to draft a "handbook" on the subject were not 
realized, Repace assumed primary responsibility for two longterm projects -- 
an "ETS literature compendium" and an "ETS workplace smoking policy guide," 
as well as a smaller project, an "ETS fact sheet."  These projects were meant 
to further the agenda first announced in Repace's 1980 article.
           
                Even as Mr. Repace expanded his activities within the Indoor 
Air Division, he was traveling around the world, at the invitation and 
expense of smoking organizations, to appear at various conferences and media 
events to promote antismoking restrictions.  For example, Mr. Repace traveled 
to New Zealand in l990 to support antismoking legislation in that country.
Press coverage of his activities there was typical of Mr. Repace's media 
appearances, including the identification of Mr. Repace as an EPA employee 
unaccompanied by the required disclaimer that his views did not then reflect 
an official EPA position.
           
                In numerous media interviews, Mr. Repace has made the 
baseless assertion that 50,000 people in the U.S. die each year from exposure 
to ETS and has left the clear impression that these views reflect EPA's 
official position rather than his personal views.  Such demonstrated bias 
would create a serious conflict of interest issue at any regulatory agency, 
apparently with the exception of EPA, most likely leading to the official's 
recusal from further involvement in the issue in question.  In fact, Mr. 
Repace continued to play a key role in the preparation of documents for the 
public that were represented as neutral and dispassionate analyses of the 
facts pertaining to ETS despite the advocacy role he was playing in his 
"private capacity."
 
        C.   How EPA Used Its Role In Indoor Air Research
             To Further An Antismoking Agenda

                1.   The ETS "Fact Sheet"

                In 1989, Repace prompted the Agency's publication of a "Fact 
Sheet" on ETS.  Despite its name, "Indoor Air Facts Number 5" made 
extravagant health claims about ETS, going far beyond the conclusions of the 
1986 reports of the National Academy of Science ("NAS") and Surgeon General 
on the same subject.  For example, it claimed that exposure to ETS was linked 
to heart disease, when both the NAS and Surgeon General had found that the 
available studies did not support that claim.
           
                The "Fact Sheet" also took certain statements in the 1986 
Surgeon General's report out of context in order to claim a consensus that 
"passive smoking significantly increases the risk of lung cancer in adults" 
(p. 1).  Whereas the Surgeon General and NAS reports had emphasized critical 
limitations on their findings of a possible connection between exposure to 
ETS and lung cancer, the "Fact Sheet" ignored those limitations and treated 
the purported relationship as irrefutable.
 
          The "Fact Sheet" also failed to note that even the limited 
conclusions of the Surgeon General and NAS reports had been strongly 
criticized and that other reviewers -- including the World Health 
Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer -- had reached 
different conclusions based upon the same data.  See, e.g., "IARC Monograph 
on the Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans:  Tobacco 
Smoking," vol. 38, p. 308 (1986).  Furthermore, a number of other studies and 
reviews published since 1986 contradicted the findings of the Surgeon General 
and NAS reports with respect to the purported relationship between ETS and 
lung cancer.(16)  None of these was mentioned in the "Fact Sheet."
           
                Finally, the "Fact Sheet" characterized ETS as "a major 
contributor of particulate indoor air pollution" (p. 2) while failing to 
mention the numerous studies showing that inadequate ventilation is the 
single most important cause of indoor air pollution.  Significantly, no SAB 
panel or expert committee ever reviewed the "Fact Sheet's" claims.  Instead, 
the document was distributed freely to the public as if it contained the 
official, carefully considered policy of the U.S. government rather than 
simply the personal opinions of Mr. Repace.
           
                2.   What EPA Doesn't Know
           
                Paradoxically, EPA elsewhere was quite candid in 
acknowledging the gaps in its knowledge about ETS.  EPA's 1987 report to 
Congress, for example, recognized that indoor air quality is not only a 
matter of specific pollution sources but also of the ways in which buildings 
are designed, operated and used.  EPA's indoor air quality program 
purportedly was designed to "address the problem from both perspectives" 
(P. 8).

                In its 1989 report to Congress, EPA indicated that it had 
"moved to establish a research program to remove the scientific 
uncertainties" identified in the 1986 NAS report on ETS (vol. I, p. 42).  In 
the same report EPA acknowledged that "[a]ctual human exposure to many of 
these [indoor air] pollutants is at this time not well understood" (vol. III, 
p. 11).   The 1989 report also emphasized the need for ventilation research, 
noting that the "entire building system is implicated in issues of indoor air 
quality" (vol. III, p. 39) and that much more research is needed concerning 
the numerous variables that determine indoor air quality (id. at 36-39).
           
                At this point, I, among others, expressed concern that there 
appeared to be a contradiction between EPA's conclusions on ETS in the "Fact 
Sheet" and the Agency's recognition elsewhere that there were large gaps in 
its knowledge about ETS.  In response, EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air 
and Radiation, William Rosenberg, denied that there was any scientific doubt.  
In a June 1989 letter to Senator Warner of Virginia, Mr. Rosenberg stated 
that "[t]he evidence, in our view, is conclusive for lung cancer and for
respiratory symptoms in children" and that "ETS has been shown to cause 
cancer and other health effects in healthy nonsmokers."
           
                The "Fact Sheet" and Mr. Rosenberg's letter make clear that 
the Agency had reached firm conclusions concerning ETS without the benefit of 
either SAB review or public comment.  Aside from the question of whether this 
position was scientifically justified, it is unclear why the Agency then 
decided to spend millions of dollars to conduct a formal "risk assessment" on 
ETS for the ostensible purpose of determining whether ETS does indeed pose a 
risk to health.
           
                3.   The ETS Technical Compendium
           
                In November 1989, EPA released a draft ETS "technical 
compendium," the second of the Agency's documents concerning ETS.  Conceived 
originally as a reference document, the compendium consisted of ten (later 
eleven) chapters on a variety of subjects not always directly related to ETS.  
With the exception of a draft chapter on "Exposure Assessment of Passive 
Smoking" by Mr. Repace, the compendium articles were solicited from 
scientists and consultants outside the Agency.
           
                Although ostensibly a collection of scientific information 
about ETS, the first chapter, written by Thomas E. Novotny, claimed, based on 
public opinion polls, that the public increasingly believes that ETS is 
harmful to health and therefore supports smoking restrictions.  But public 
opinion and acceptance of smoking restrictions are obviously irrelevant to 
the scientific and technical issues of whether the restrictions are justified 
in the first place.  In addition, public opinion on scientific issues often 
is shaped by dramatic reporting, not by familiarity with the science itself.  
EPA scientists should have recognized that using public opinion to support a 
scientific hypothesis -- and ultimately, new regulations -- was 
irresponsible.  That is particularly so when individual agency employees had 
played such a pivotal role in forming the very public opinion upon which they 
now were proposing to rely.
           
                In addition to the chapter on trends in public attitudes, the 
compendium contained other articles on active smoking and on economic issues 
surrounding workplace smoking.  The only unifying theme of the compendium is 
that, in the Agency's view, smoking and ETS are "bad."  Like most of the 
Agency's outside contractors on ETS, many chapter authors for the compendium, 
including Stanton Glantz, Jonathan Samet, and, of course, James Repace -- had 
long been active in the antismoking movement.
           
                Although styled (and later defended by the Agency) as a 
scientific reference document, the compendium was in fact designed as an 
advocacy document for smoking restrictions.  The preface to the compendium 
indicated that it was intended to be distributed to scientists, public 
officials, legislators and those in the private sector who are or may be 
concerned about ETS.  The overall purpose was to "provide information 
necessary to allow the public, government agencies, and the building industry 
to make well-informed choices regarding exposure to ETS" (p. 2).  The letter 
accompanying the draft compendium indicated that the compendium was an 
"integral component of [EPA's] ETS strategy," which was to include a separate 
"policy-maker's guide" that in turn would be a simplified version of the 
compendium.
           
                It is hard to see how policymakers could make "well informed" 
choices on the basis of the information contained in the compendium or the 
simplified version known as the "policy guide."  Both the compendium and the 
policy guide were initiated and drafted long before the Agency had prepared a
formal risk assessment on ETS.  By these actions, EPA violated the public 
trust in three ways.  First, EPA conducted an end run around the statute 
creating the SAB review mechanism.  In doing so, it not only threatened the 
integrity of the SAB review process but ran the risk of alarming the public 
for no good reason.  In addition, EPA deliberately permitted policy to drive 
science rather than the other way around.  As the "Fact Sheet" demonstrated, 
EPA started with the restrictive policy it wanted to promote and then worked 
backward to "develop" the scientific conclusions necessary to justify that 
policy.  Finally, even though it has no statutory authority to regulate 
smoking, EPA's Indoor Air Division sought to become the de facto federal ETS 
regulatory authority by using the "Fact Sheet," the compendium, the policy 
guide and the ETS risk assessment to frighten employers and state and local 
regulators into imposing additional restrictions on smoking.
           
                4.   Bias In Preparing The Compendium

                Although still in draft form and not reviewed by the SAB, the 
compendium received widespread media attention.  Robert Axelrad, Director of 
the Indoor Air Division, had asserted unequivocally in a May 8, 1990, letter 
to The Tobacco Institute's counsel that EPA was "not interested in promoting
any media attention to the documents while they are in draft form and will do 
everything possible to assure that they are not construed as EPA policy."  
Notwithstanding Mr. Axelrad's assurances, the compendium was leaked to the 
press and its more sensational claims openly publicized prior to any 
scientific review of the document's contents.  According to a February 1993 
report by the General Accounting Office ("GAO"), EPA staff in April 1991, 
before EPA had completed its own internal review of the document, improperly 
sent a draft of the compendium to several external reviewers, including 
Stanton Glantz.  Glantz, an outspoken antismoking activist since the 1960s, 
immediately proceeded to provide a copy to an Associated Press reporter.  
According to the GAO, Glantz claims that his release of the report was simply 
a "mistake."
           
                Most disturbing was the public dissemination of the chapter 
on cardiovascular disease.  Glantz, one of the authors of that chapter, 
appeared in Boston -- again with James Repace -- at the World Conference on 
Lung Health in late May 1990 and gave both a presentation and news interviews 
on that chapter.  Dr. Glantz used the occasion to repeat and underscore the 
unsupported claim that more than 30,000 nonsmoking Americans die of heart 
disease each year as a result of exposure to ETS.
           
                This activity made a mockery of EPA's procedures for ensuring 
that its policy documents receive a full and fair review before they are 
finalized.  Glantz has a long record of public statements demonstrating his 
commitment to that political agenda, notwithstanding the lack of scientific
support for his claims concerning ETS.  While his training is in mechanical 
engineering rather than medicine or some other relevant discipline, he has 
pontificated on every conceivable smoking-related topic, such as advertising 
and economic issues, about which he plainly can make no claim to professional 
competence.
 
                To cite one example, Dr. Glantz's organization stated in its 
1983 annual report that "irrefutable medical and scientific evidence has 
confirmed what millions of nonsmokers have intuitively known for a long time:  
Tobacco smoke * * * poses a serious health risk for nonsmokers who breathe
secondhand smoke."  Thus, Dr. Glantz's mind was closed on the 
ETS/cardiovascular disease issue three years before the 1986 reports of the 
Surgeon General and National Academy of Sciences both determined that there 
was insufficient evidence to support the claim that exposure to ETS presents 
any increased risk of heart disease.
           
                At an April 1990 antismoking conference in Perth, Australia, 
Glantz made a series of revealing comments.  First, he noted that "it's very 
nice to see that the same ideas that a few of us were advocating in 1983 
which were viewed as so strange, radical and hopeless have now really become 
very mainstream."  A self-described "lunatic" on the issue, Dr. Glantz then 
excoriated the American Cancer Society for its alleged decision to terminate 
an employee for intemperate behavior in connection with a local smoking 
ordinance.  "He [the employee] may be a little impolitic which I of course 
view as a plus.  But you know activists need [to be] rewarded[.] * * * I had 
no objection to all the people who were given awards on the first day [of the 
conference], but I did notice that there was not a single lunatic among 
them * * *."  He further confessed that "[t]he main thing the science has 
done on the issue of ETS, in addition to help people like me pay mortgages, 
is it has legitimized the concerns that people have that they don't like 
cigarette smoke.  And that is a strong emotional force that needs to be 
harnessed and used."  Glantz concluded by stating that "we are all on a roll 
and the bastards are on the run and I urge you to keep chasing them."
           
                I expressed my concern to Mr. Reilly that the selection of 
Dr. Glantz to write part of the ETS compendium was a grave error in judgment.  
Glantz's involvement, coupled with leaks of information and inadequacies in 
the review process, led me to conclude that the Agency's procedures had been 
seriously compromised.
           
                In response, Mr. Reilly assured me that the SAB would be 
given an opportunity to review the technical compendium and that EPA had not 
yet decided whether Glantz's chapter would be included in it.  Ultimately, 
however, the technical compendium was not reviewed by the SAB and Mr. Reilly 
subsequently took the position, contrary to the Agency's prior statements, 
that the compendium was not a basis for the policy guide or risk assessment.
 
                5.   EPA Reneges On Its Pledge To Permit The
                     SAB To Review The Technical Compendium

                Despite Mr. Reilly's repeated oral and written assurances, 
the SAB was never given an opportunity to review the compendium.  In early 
1991, EPA switched course and began to act as if the compendium had never 
been written.  In a letter to me, Mr, Reilly claimed that SAB review of the 
compendium was unnecessary since the compendium had "no direct bearing on 
future agency action."  When he was questioned by the House Commerce 
Committee's Subcommittee on Health and the Environment in April 1991, EPA's 
Deputy Administrator Henry Habicht could only say the compendium was "on a 
separate track."
 
                That the technical compendium got onto "a different track" is 
curious, considering especially that when the SAB finally did review the 
policy guide in December 1990, it requested a "supporting document that 
explicitly states the technical basis for each of [the policy guide's] 
summary statements on the state of scientific knowledge."  As noted above, 
EPA originally intended the policy guide to be a simplified version of the 
compendium.  When I asked Mr. Reilly "[w]hat led the agency to redefine the 
role of the technical compendium," the answer was that the media had 
interpreted its release to the public as EPA endorsement of the draft 
document's content.  As EPA staff had rather disingenuously told the media at 
the time the compendium was leaked, that interpretation was inappropriate.  
The Associated Press reported on May 29, 1991 that --
 
                [m]uch of the controversy over the report
                has focused on the estimate of 37,000
                heart disease deaths attributed to
                secondhand smoke.  That section was
                written by Stanton Glantz and Dr. William
                Parmley of the University of California,
                San Francisco.

                "Thirty-seven thousand may be a figment of
                Stan Glantz's imagination and William
                Parmley's imagination, or it may be a real
                estimate," said Axelrad [Director of EPA's
                Indoor Air Division].

                "Any effort or any attempt to imply any
                kind of endorsement or acceptance by EPA"
                of the death estimates in the technical
                compendium "is at this time totally
                inappropriate," he said.
          
        D.   The ETS "Policy Guide"
          
                In June 1990, EPA released formally the first draft of its 
policy guide, entitled "Environmental Tobacco Smoke:  A Guide to Workplace 
Smoking Policies."  The guide's stated purpose was to provide government and 
private sector decision makers with information on the technical basis for 
controlling exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and to describe a variety 
of technical and policy options for instituting effective smoking 
restrictions.
          
                It has never been clear why EPA prepared and released a risk 
management document like the policy guide and before that, the "Fact Sheet" 
and compendium, in advance of any final scientific assessment of the supposed 
"risk" to be managed.  Ordinarily, an agency concerned with public health 
responds to allegations that a particular substance presents a risk to health 
by conducting a formal analysis of the scientific data called a "risk 
assessment."  This assumes, of course, that the agency has statutory 
authority to regulate that substance.  If the risk assessment justifies the 
conclusion that a significant risk exists, the next step is to develop 
policies or regulations to mitigate that risk.  As the National Academy of 
Sciences/National Research Council has recognized, risk assessment is 
concerned with defining the health effects of exposure to hazards, while risk 
management is the process of selecting the most appropriate policy 
alternative by integrating risk assessment results with engineering data and 
social, economic and political concerns.(17)
           
                Obviously, if the risk from ETS at levels typically 
encountered in the workplace was found to be minimal, there would be no 
justification for recommending, as did the "Fact Sheet" and policy guide, 
that smoking be prohibited except in separately ventilated areas.  Even 
Administrator Reilly recently conceded in a letter to me that "beginning the 
development of an Agency risk assessment after the commencement of work on 
the draft policy guide gave the appearance of the very situation -- i.e., 
policy leading science -- that I am committed to avoid."
           
                Equally troubling is the fact that the guide even went so far 
as to encourage ETS-based lawsuits by employees against their employers.  In 
doing so, the policy guide grossly overstated the legal significance and 
precedential value of the handful of cases favorable to the policy guide's 
viewpoint while understating the significance of the vast majority of others, 
which were not.
           
                The perception that the EPA policy guide on workplace smoking 
crosses the line from information into advocacy is not mine alone.  ICF 
Incorporated, which functioned as the nominal prime contractor for 
preparation of the policy guide, recently provided me with a marked-up copy 
of the guide purporting to reflect ICF's own handwritten editorial comments.  
I discovered that my concerns about the tone and emphasis of the legal 
discussion in the policy guide were shared by ICF's own internal reviewers.  
Marginal comments on this section included such observations as "it seems 
really weird to have a much lengthier discussion on litigation than on the 
effectiveness of various mitigation alternatives" and "this discussion is too 
rah-rah -- this chapter should be more objective in tone."  For reasons that 
have never been explained fully, however, ICF apparently was not asked to 
comment on the draft prior to its public release in June 1990, even though 
ICF supposedly supervised the preparation of this document by its 
subcontractor, the Smoking Policy Institute.  As will be discussed later, 
many questions remain about the Smoking Policy Institute's role in preparing 
the policy guide.
           
                The SAB's eventual review of the scientific conclusions in 
the policy guide was incomplete at best.  Prior to the guide's release, EPA 
had decided to limit the SAB's review to those parts that referred to the 
risk assessment, to ensure that the latter was "properly characterized."  
Since the SAB had not yet seen a risk assessment draft it could approve, one 
must question how it could make sure that the policy guide properly 
characterized it.  Moreover, the policy guide covered a much broader range of 
issues than the risk assessment.  The policy guide had been drafted based on 
the technical compendium, which, as I have explained, EPA has never given to 
the SAB to review, and which makes many more health claims than does the ETS 
risk assessment.  These include unsupported assertions that ETS has been 
shown to cause cardiovascular disease and suggestions that ETS has been 
associated with brain cancer.
           
                Such extravagant claims are at odds with EPA's private 
admissions to other government officials that "[w]e know very little about 
ETS exposure in the workplace, and cannot estimate the relative significance 
of workplace vs. home vs. all other sources of exposure; nor can we clarify 
the significance/role/impact of exposure to other pollutants (e.g., radon and 
other air carcinogens) in addition/conjunction with ETS exposure."(18)  If 
EPA knows "very little" about ETS exposure in the workplace, it is difficult 
to understand why it would decide to issue a workplace policy guide.  EPA 
cannot assert, as it did repeatedly in the policy guide, that only smoking 
bans or separately ventilated smoking lounges are appropriate without 
occupational exposure data.  In the absence of such data, the policy guide's 
recommendations necessarily reflect only the personal preferences of the 
guide's authors.  I expressed these concerns many times in writing to EPA 
Administrator Reilly and received noncommittal replies.
      
        E.   Irregularities In Contract Award Procedures

                The selection of the policy guide's author, Robert Rosner of 
the Smoking Policy Institute ("SPI"), raises further questions about the 
document's objectivity and reliability.  SPI is in the business of 
counselling employers on the implementation of smoking policies and operating 
smoking cessation clinics.  This organization therefore had a vested 
financial interest in conveying the impression in the policy guide that 
employers without smoking policies or cessation programs were at risk of 
lawsuits or worse.
           
                In addition, Mr. Rosner had no technical background in any of 
the areas on which the policy guide purported to reach definitive 
conclusions.(19)  These include the possible health effects of exposure to 
ETS (and other indoor air components), the legal ramifications of workplace 
smoking policies, public attitudes toward smoking, and the claimed economic 
consequences of permitting smoking in the workplace.
           
                Apart from this obvious conflict of interest and lack of 
necessary qualifications, the award of the SPI subcontract appears to have 
violated federal procurement regulations, an impropriety EPA has recognized 
only grudgingly.  As ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Oversight 
and Investigations of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce, I uncovered 
evidence that SPI was improperly sole sourced on the subcontract, and that 
the choice was made by Indoor Air Division officials at EPA rather than by 
the prime contractor, ICF Incorporated.  This abuse of the contracting 
process, as well as the conflict of interest noted above, has been brought to 
the attention of the EPA Inspector General.
           
                Under federal regulations, an agency may not specify the use 
of a certain subcontractor without competitive bidding.  In the case of the 
policy guide, EPA staff first solicited the Smoking Policy Institute for the 
job and then sought to funnel the work through the main contractor, ICF 
Incorporated.  In fact, Robert Axelrad telephoned SPI's Rosner in mid-1988, 
before getting ICF involved, and told Rosner that EPA had $30,000 to spend on 
the project for that fiscal year and also would provide funding the following 
year.  On July 23, 1988, Mr. Axelrad followed up with a bid solicitation 
letter to Mr. Rosner:
 
                The attached stack of material represents
                the current status of the technical manual
                on environmental tobacco smoke which we
                discussed in our telephone conversation on
                the 11th.

                As you will see from a review of this
                material, substantial portions of the
                manuscript are still to be written/
                assigned/edited.  What I am looking for is
                someone who can take the lead role at this
                stage in ensuring that the document is:
                a) conceptually sound; [and] b) a useful
                addition to the body of knowledge
                available on environmental tobacco smoke
                at a reasonable cost.  This would entail
                managing the entire process from this
                point to completion of a camera-ready
                manuscript.

                If you are interested in taking on the
                task, please send me a letter describing:

                1.   The conceptual changes you would
                     make, and a revised outline
                     reflecting your suggested changes;

                2.   A brief description of tasks which
                     you perceive to be necessary to get
                     from here to there; and

                3.   A reasonably detailed all-inclusiue
                     budget for accomplishing the above.

                As I mentioned to you on the phone, I have
                approximately $30K to begin the project
                this fiscal year and am prepared to put
                limited funds into the effort next year.

                An arrangement was made in August 1988 that SPI would be paid 
by making SPI a subcontractor to ICF.(20)  The "justification" memo that ICF 
wrote to support the sole-source subcontract stated that SPI was uniquely 
qualified.  There was no support for that claim, however, nor any indication 
that ICF had made any evaluation of SPI.  The drafts of the policy guide 
written by SPI were not even copied to ICF but went straight to Mr. Axelrad 
at EPA.
           
                The only copy of the policy guide commented upon by ICF was 
the draft released publicly in June 1990.  This raises questions about Mr. 
Reilly's statement to me in March 1992 that "ICF's role was, and is, more 
than simply a conduit for payments to the Smoking Policy Institute.  In 
addition to providing comments on the various drafts prepared, ICF managed
much of the external review process * * *."  The documents from ICF's files 
recently turned over to me suggest that, far from commenting on "various 
drafts," ICF's first opportunity to comment on the policy guide occurred when 
the document was released for public comment.  In sum, ICF file documents 
confirm that its involvement began only after the policy guide was released 
publicly -- and after I had begun to raise questions about the propriety of 
the SPI contract.
           
                The situation with SPI further underscores the fact that a 
risk assessment was crafted to justify a policy that had been adopted long 
before.  The record clearly shows, first, that EPA staff hand-picked SPI to 
prepare documents that would advocate workplace smoking restrictions long 
before any assessment of the science had been completed; second, that EPA 
arranged for SPI to be signed up as a subcontractor to ICF to circumvent 
applicable federal procurement requirements; and finally that, in this way, 
taxpayer funds helped produce what is essentially a marketing and promotion 
aid for SPI's business.
           
                Unfortunately, the SPI contract appears to be but one example 
of a more general pattern of contractual problems at EPA.  In light of 
widespread revelations about EPA's contracting practices, on July 8, 1992, 
Chairman Dingell convened the House Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations to conduct hearings on "The Collapse of Contract 
Management at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."  The majority of the 
hearing was devoted to a number of instances of contractual abuse and 
mismanagement at EPA that had been identified by the GAO and the EPA 
Inspector General.
 
                Whether the problems with the SPI subcontract would have come 
to light absent a congressional investigation is an open question.  The 
replies that I received to my inquiries to Mr. Reilly as late as March 1992 
were less than forthcoming.  In a letter to me dated March 24, 1992, for 
example, Mr. Reilly unequivocally stated that --
 
                [w]e do not agree that the subcontract
                issued to the Smoking Policy Institute
                (SPI) was issued in violation of Federal
                procurement law.  * * *  These contracts
                were competitively awarded in full
                compliance with all Federal contract laws.
                The smoking policy guide was well within
                the scope of the [ongoing EPA/ICF]
                contracts and ICF's selection of the
                Smoking Policy Institute was proper based
                on their determination that the SPI had
                unique or specialized experience in this
                area.
          
Mr. Reilly also stated without qualification that "[t]he Smoking Policy 
Institute was not selected by EPA staff but by ICF," even though Mr. Axelrad 
had told my staff six months earlier that EPA staff had selected SPI.
          
                Even more curiously, at the Oversight hearing on July 8, 
1992, Mr. Reilly repeatedly claimed that he lacked knowledge about how SPI 
was selected, the nature of SPI's supposed "specialized experience," the fact 
that SPI was in the business of promoting workplace smoking restrictions, or
any other information pertinent to the unqualified statements he had made in 
his March 24, 1992, letter to me.  It is impossible to square these oral 
statements with the prior and quite detailed assurances Mr. Reilly had 
provided to me in writing.
 
                Since then, EPA has reversed its earlier public position that 
the SPI contract was awarded properly.  At the July 8 hearing, the Agency's 
own Chief Financial Officer acknowledged that "this might very well be an 
improper contracting practice.  It may be a pass-through and the designating 
of the $30,000 may also be improper."  Mr. Reilly's most recent letter to me 
dated July 31, 1992, attaches a memorandum from Mr. Axelrad to his supervisor 
at EPA, Eileen Claussen.  Mr. Axelrad's memorandum acknowledges that his 
decision to contact SPI outside normal procurement procedures was 
inappropriate and that his recommendation "probably" caused ICF to select SPI 
as the subcontractor.  Mr. Reilly indicated at the July 8 hearing that he had 
requested an investigation by EPA's Inspector General of the apparent 
conflict of interest and other improprieties in the award of the SPI 
contract.  Congressmen Dingell and I made a similar request and asked that 
the Inspector General report his findings to the House Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations.
 
                In March 1993, the Inspector General sent me a letter setting 
forth his findings.  In that letter, the Inspector General states as follows:
 
                We believe the award [of the contracts to SPI]
                was tainted in how it was processed.  First,
                there was no attempt by ICF to seek competi-
                tion.  Second, the actions by an EPA program
                official gave the appearance that he, rather
                than ICF, selected the subcontractor.
                       
The Inspector General also found that "the EPA believed that "it may have 
been 'unauthorized action' under the EPAAR [EPA Acquisition Regulations]."  
The Inspector General also indicated that "the procurement should not have 
proceeded on a non-competitive basis."
                      
                EPA's contracting improprieties in connection with the 
preparation of the four ETS documents are not confined to the policy guide.  
In June 1993, the Inspector General reported to me that similar abuses had 
occurred in connection with several of the ETS risk assessment subcontracts.  
The most egregious of these appears to be the subcontract between ICF, once 
again the prime contractor, and Kenneth G. Brown, Inc., which drafted most of 
the critical sections on lung cancer.  The Inspector General states that in 
the case of the Brown subcontract, "EPA program personnel and ICF simply 
circumvented the contracting officers" altogether, clearly a violation of 
proper procedures.  Like the SPI subcontract, the Brown subcontract also was 
awarded on a non-competitive basis, and the only justification for that 
decision that could be found was an undated and unsigned "sole source 
justification" file memorandum.

        F.   The Science Advisory Board's Review Of
             The Risk Assessment
                       
                The first drafts of the ETS risk assessment and the workplace 
policy guide were released for public comment in June 1990.  At the same 
time, EPA transmitted the drafts to the SAB, requesting formal review.  A 
hearing before a subpanel of the SAB was held in December 1990.  The subpanel 
reported the results of its review to the SAB Executive Committee in April 
1991.  The risk assessment was sent back to EPA with directions that it be 
revised extensively.  After major rewriting, a second draft was released in 
June 1992 and a second SAB hearing was held before essentially the same 
subpanel in July of that year.  Following the SAB's report to the SAB 
Executive Committee in October 1992, the final risk assessment was released 
on January 7, 1993.
           
                At both the public hearings and in written comments, the 
validity of most of the risk assessment's assertions was criticized by a 
number of scientists with expertise in the relevant disciplines.  
Unfortunately, most of these criticisms were ignored for reasons having 
nothing to do with science and everything to do with politics.  Although the 
SAB is supposed to function as an independent and unbiased review body, in 
the case of the ETS risk assessment it became apparent early on that the SAB 
review process itself had become as intensely politicized as the rest of EPA.
           
                1.  How The Panel Was Selected
           
                The EPA Science Advisory Board is intended to serve as an 
independent review body composed of impartial experts from outside the 
Agency.  Its function is to ensure Agency accountability and integrity in the 
use of science.(21)  In addition to the seven standing members of the SAB's 
Indoor Air Quality and Total Human Exposure Committee, the decision was made 
at EPA to select nine scientists to serve in an ad hoc capacity on the panel 
that was to review the draft ETS risk assessment and policy guide.  Because 
they were to review work that had been developed and put forward by Agency 
staff and others with vocal antismoking records, their ability to conduct a 
fully objective critique was essential.  Therefore, at the outset I expressed 
concern to EPA that the selection process be above reproach.  I also urged 
EPA to apply certain -- I thought self-evident -- criteria to ensure 
objectivity.
            
                My suggestions included that (1) the SAB panel be limited to 
recognized authorities with relevant specialties; (2) the members should not 
have participated in the development of the technical compendium, the policy 
guide, or the risk assessment, or have already provided comments on them, 
including serving as EPA contractors or grantees; and (3) they should not 
have become enmeshed in the political controversy surrounding ETS by having 
testified for or against smoking restrictions, or by having been active 
members of groups that had taken a position on the broader issues concerning 
smoking.
 
                EPA squarely rejected the second and third criteria.  In his 
reply to me, Mr. Reilly stated it was EPA's belief that there was merit in 
having individuals who were previously involved, promising that "the extent 
of any prior involvement will be publicly disclosed at the meeting."  In 
fact, that was not fully done.  Regarding activists' filling SAB positions, 
Mr. Reilly also promised that "should technical conditions require the 
presence of such an individual on the panel, he or she would be balanced by 
the presence of an individual who could represent the opposing point of 
view."
           
                Unfortunately, the panel ultimately was not balanced in the 
way Mr. Reilly had suggested.  Not one of the candidates suggested by the 
tobacco industry was even contacted for inclusion on the panel.  In contrast, 
three of six persons suggested by antismoking organizations were chosen, 
including Dr. David Burns.
           
                The selection of Dr. Burns was especially puzzling, given 
that Mr. Reilly had assured me shortly before Dr. Burns' selection that 
"experience has shown that the deliberative process is generally not aided if 
extreme views are represented on the panel itself."  Long before EPA 
appointed him to evaluate the scientific data on ETS, David Burns was 
spending by his own reckoning half of his time in the antismoking movement.  
He had claimed in 1988, for example, that ETS caused 3,000 deaths per year 
(Nonsmoking Ordinance, So Far, Proves To Be No Hazard To Economic Health, Los 
Angeles Times, January 8, 1989, sec. 2, p. 1).  He also had testified in 
several cases in favor of local antismoking measures -- including a 1987 
initiative in Del Mar, California that would have banned smoking outdoors, on 
city sidewalks and in beach areas (UCSD Expert is Smoking's Archenemy, Los 
Angeles Times, August 21, 1989, sec. 2, p. 1).   In addition, Dr. Burns had 
testified in favor of a tobacco advertising ban that a Canadian trial court 
subsequently held to be a violation of the free speech guarantee of the 
Canadian Constitution (RJR-MacDonald  Inc. v. Le Procureur General du Canada, 
No. 500-05009755-883 (Superior Court of Quebec, July 26, 1991)).(22)  In that 
testimony, Dr. Burns stated that --
 
        -    in the two years he worked for the National
             Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, he had
             helped devise programs to discourage smoking;

        -    he had served on the American Cancer Society
             committee responsible for setting policy on
             tobacco issues;

        -    he had served as senior scientific advisor for
             the 1986 Surgeon General's report on ETS and
             regarded that work as part of his antismoking
             efforts;

        -    he is a consultant to plaintiffs' counsel in
             tobacco product liability cases.
          
                In his Canadian testimony, Dr. Burns acknowledged that his 
activities are part of an effort to "see smoking behavior disappear from 
society" (transcript at p. 10470).  He acknowledged that "much of the work 
that [he did] within the university is to teach on * * * the means by which 
tobacco can be controlled within society" (id. at 4964).  Dr. Burns 
demonstrated his dogmatism when he said that there "is no credible scientist" 
who would disagree with his views.  Finally, Dr. Burns made clear that his 
single-minded focus is on promoting and supporting restrictions on the use of 
tobacco in any public place in order to penalize smokers for their decision 
to smoke.
 
        -    [I]n order to modify smoking behavior, one
             needs to look at * * * changing the public
             image of tobacco, changing the locations in
             which tobacco can be used, to create an
             environment in the larger society that actually
             discourages rather than encourages the use of
             this product (id. at 10462).

        -    [T]he key * * * is not simply providing
             the information * * * it's also to change
             the larger environment in which that
             individual functions to make it less
             conducive to using cigarettes and more
             rewarding to not use cigarettes (id. at
             10462-463).

        -    I'm also not particularly inclined to testify
             to issues relating to the benefits, if you
             will, of tobacco or to any of the open
             scientific questions * * * (id. at 4999).

        -    And to the extent that [the Del Mar smoking
             ordinance] changes the image of the cigarette
             smoker and changes the psychological and
             sociologic rewards of cigarette smoking, then
             one -- then it contributes to changing the
             environment in which smoking occurs (id. at
             10514-515).
          
                By his own testimony, therefore, Dr. Burns is incapable of 
even discussing the "open scientific questions" concerning tobacco use, let 
alone evaluating scientific data relevant to those questions in an objective 
manner.  I would add, by the way, that Dr. Burns himself has not conducted or
published any original scientific research on ETS.
                       
                Some at EPA recognized, if belatedly, that Dr. Burns' 
inclusion on the SAB panel would not be appropriate.  In addition to the 
problems previously mentioned, Burns had been involved in reviewing and 
commenting on earlier versions of the risk assessment and could hardly be 
expected to be objective in evaluating a report reflecting his own 
substantial input.  On October 22, 1990, the New York Times reported that SAB 
Staff Director Dr. Donald Barnes had acknowledged that Dr. Burns was not 
suitable for membership because of his demonstrated bias against smoking.  
Imagine my surprise when, only two days after the New York Times story 
appeared, Mr. Reilly informed me that Dr. Burns would be included on the 
panel after all!
                    
                The decision not to include Dr. Burns had been followed 
immediately by claims in the press by antismoking activists that Dr. Burns 
had been dropped because of political pressure from the tobacco industry.  At 
the same time, the press also was reporting that some committee members had 
acted as advisors or peer reviewers for the Council on Indoor Air Research 
("CIAR"), a research organization that receives funding from the tobacco 
industry.  Allegations were made that these committee members were biased as 
a result of their association with CIAR.  In fact, the allegations were 
baseless.  Four of the six people with CIAR associations already were 
standing SAB committee members, and not one had been suggested by the tobacco 
industry.  Regardless of the falseness of the charges, public reporting of 
them placed pressure on the members not to criticize the Agency's drafts lest 
they be seen as "biased" in favor of the tobacco industry.  As one of these 
individuals, SAB panel chairman Dr. Lippmann, candidly admitted to the press, 
"[i]t's not that I'm a tool of industry. I'm a bigger tool of government.  
I've been working for the EPA longer.  I have more to lose by offending the 
EPA than industry."(23)  Another panelist, James Woods, promised the 
Associated Press on November 20, 1990 -- well before the SAB hearing -- that 
"the comments he intends to make on the EPA report will demonstrate that he 
is not biased toward tobacco companies.  'Wait and see what I say at the 
hearing.'"
           
                At this point the process had become so deeply enmeshed in 
controversy that an objective review by the panel was no longer possible.  As 
a consequence, the only responsible course of action would have been to 
reconstitute the panel.  Even the New York Times called for such a move, in
an editorial entitled "Objectivity Up in Smoke."  In response, the EPA simply 
proceeded as if no problem existed.
 
                During my investigation, we learned from both Donald Barnes, 
the SAB staff director, and Robert Flaak, his assistant, that Mr. Flaak 
deliberately went around his boss, Dr. Barnes, to Dr. Lippmann and enlisted 
his support in overruling Dr. Barnes' decision not to invite Dr. Burns to 
join the panel.  It would not be unreasonable in these circumstances for a 
scientist in Dr. Lippmann's position to fear the public consequences of a 
refusal to give in to the demand of the antismoking lobby on this issue.  
There also were suggestions that Dr. Lippmann and Mr. Flaak may have met with 
at least one reporter who had written a series of articles on ETS prior to 
the December 1990 SAB meeting to discuss the press coverage the meeting might 
generate based upon the panel's conclusion.  Many unanswered questions remain 
about Mr. Flaak's behind-the-scenes role in conducting off the-record 
meetings with antismokers and other activities in connection with the panel's 
composition.
           
                There are questions about the objectivity of other SAB panel 
members.  As mentioned earlier, Jonathan Samet of the University of New 
Mexico had stated that uncertainties regarding ETS scientific data should not 
interfere with tobacco control efforts.  Like Burns, Samet also had been 
involved in reviewing earlier drafts of the risk assessment.  Before that, he 
had played a major role in drafting or reviewing portions of the technical 
compendium and policy guide.  In addition, eight of the fifteen panel members 
were themselves responsible for scientific studies relied upon in the first 
or second drafts of the risk assessment -- hardly the type of circumstances 
that ensure independent evaluation.(24)
           
                In response to my written and oral communications of concern 
about these developments, Mr. Reilly blithely assured me that "the panelists 
are well qualified to deal with the technical issues that are being directed 
to them.  To the degree that there are differing scientific views on the
information under review, the SAB process * * * allow[s] for and mandate[s] a 
balanced, open discussion of the issues, with ample opportunity for input 
from and observation by the public."  Of course, all the discussion and 
"input" in the world will not sway a mind already closed on the issue in
question.  Ultimately, moreover, no such discussion was permitted and input 
from the public was sharply limited.
           
                When I pressed Mr. Reilly on these points, he replied with a 
series of non sequiturs.  Stating that "it is not easy to select a panel of 
experts on any 'highly charged emotional and political issue' such as ETS," 
he then asserted without further explanation that the SAB panel would be
capable of providing objective advice and that to delay the process to 
reconstitute the panel would "not serve the public interest."  How the public 
interest was served by EPA's pressing ahead despite the problems that had 
arisen has never been explained.  Interestingly, Mr. Reilly made no attempt 
to deny or refute the specific allegations made against Dr. Burns and other 
panel members.
           
                Equally disturbing, I have learned recently that, as the SAB 
considered the first draft of the risk assessment, Dr. Steven Bayard, the EPA 
staff member with principal responsibility for the document, was providing 
"enthusiastic" support to a grant proposal by Dr. Stanton Glantz and his 
associates in California for a project designed explicitly to discredit any 
scientist who has consulted on the ETS issue for the tobacco industry and 
expressed critical views with regard to the risk assessment.  As discussed 
earlier, Dr. Glantz prepared a chapter of the ETS technical compendium and is 
a well-known and vocal antitobacco activist.  The grant proposal seeks to 
study "[t]he tobacco industry and scientific research."  The purpose of the 
study is to arrive at "[a]n understanding of tobacco industry tactics for 
influencing research on ETS" by identifying whether particular scientists are 
"funded by the tobacco industry."  That Dr. Bayard's January 10, 1991, letter 
in support of that application offered to continue to cooperate actively with 
Glantz and his associates at a time when the risk assessment was still under
SAB review raises questions about the EPA staff's approach to resolving 
legitimate scientific criticisms of their work.  Rather than addressing those 
criticisms on the merits, Dr. Bayard's endorsement of the Glantz proposal 
creates the impression that he is more interested in silencing his critics.
           
                Dr. Bayard's participation in this effort is even more 
alarming given his role in the selection of SAB panelists.  Mr. Reilly 
repeatedly shunted aside bias concerns on the ground that the procedures for 
selecting SAB members are intended to ensure that members "are free from 
legal and perceived conflict-of-interest."  Later on, however, I wrote to EPA 
asking for an explanation of how the ETS panel was being selected.  In 
response, EPA informed me that the candidates were being selected by Dr. 
Bayard, with assistance from Robert Axelrad and James Repace.
           
                2.   The Initial SAB Hearing
           
                Despite Mr. Reilly's promises, the SAB panel meeting on 
December 4-5, 1990, was conducted in a manner that effectively prevented 
scientific viewpoints critical of the two draft ETS documents from being 
given anything resembling a full and fair hearing.  Less than two hours were 
allowed for presentations by scientists critical of the report.  Certain 
attendees who had personally requested time from the Chairman were foreclosed 
from speaking under the agenda that had been formulated.  The input of 
several critical points of view was lost, as well as the opportunity for the 
panel to ask questions and to conduct a dialogue with other scientists.  In 
contrast, twice as much time was given to antismoking organizations.  
Although there certainly was enough time to accommodate all who had asked to 
speak, several scientists who had expressed doubts about the risk assessment 
and policy guide were denied the chance.  No explanation was given for the 
failure to accommodate these speakers or why the SAB hearing was conducted 
with such rigidity.  Most SAB review panels are conducted in an open and 
collegial manner that encourages vigorous discussion of all competing 
scientific viewpoints.
           
                Two of the ETS panel members who agreed to review the report 
did not even attend the first day of the meeting, which was the only time 
reserved for public comment.  Other panel members openly admitted that they 
had not read any of the written submissions.  The panel members did not 
address or acknowledge the many public comments in their written reviews.
           
                No presentations were permitted on the risk assessment 
chapter dealing with the respiratory health of children.  Without providing 
any opportunity for public comment, EPA had transmitted to the SAB a new 
"draft report with a detailed description and analysis of 26 studies" on
childhood exposure to ETS.  Not surprisingly, the document failed to discuss 
any studies that did not support EPA's preferred conclusions.  By inserting 
it at the last moment and preventing public discussion of the topic at the 
hearing, meaningful public scrutiny of the Agency's conclusion was excluded.
           
                The negative perception created by the SAB was heightened by 
the Chairman's summary remarks and statements by him and others to the press 
after the panel adjourned, misleadingly suggesting that the panel had reached 
a "consensus" on the classification of ETS as a human carcinogen.  As the 
transcript of the meeting shows, there was no such "consensus."  Several 
panel members criticized the draft in key respects.  Dr. Jeffrey Kabat, for 
example, repeatedly questioned important aspects of the methodology used in 
the draft as well as its treatment of specific studies before concluding that 
classifying ETS as a Group A carcinogen could be "rash" (II, p. 15).  Dr. 
Kabat stated that "the observations on nonsmokers that have been made so far 
are compatible with either an increased risk from passive smoking or an 
absence of risk or I would say that with a risk that's so small that maybe 
it's not -- you can't measure it with certainty" (ibid).  Others on the panel 
expressed similar reservations about the draft's conclusions.(25)
 
                The advisory panel also did not consider a number of
pertinent studies, including a study by one of its own members, Dr. William 
Blot of the National Cancer Institute.  Dr. Blot had served, along with Dr. 
Wu-Williams, as one of the principal investigators on one of the largest 
studies ever conducted on ETS and lung cancer among nonsmokers.  However, the 
new study was not discussed by the panel, even though the study had been 
accepted for publication in the British Journal of Cancer before the panel 
met.  Amazingly, Dr. Blot himself did not mention the study, which reported 
no health risks from ETS.

                After the panel meeting, Dr. Lippmann held a press conference 
to announce the conclusion that ETS "should be classified as a Class A 
carcinogen."  The impropriety of a supposedly impartial scientific expert 
attempting to frighten the public on the basis of an incomplete and 
unsupported document speaks for itself.  But Dr. Lippmann compounded this
breach by misrepresenting the panel's conclusions concerning the strength of 
the evidence.  Among other remarks, Lippmann stated that "if anything, [the 
evidence] suggests that it is more potent than we had thought" (Evidence 
Shows That Tobacco Smoke Causes Cancer, Head of EPA Panel Says, Bureau of 
National Affairs, Daily Report for Executives, December 7, 1990, p. A8).  
Perhaps realizing that he had gone too far, Lippmann subsequently tried to 
qualify his remarks but succeeded only in being inconsistent.  "[T]his is a 
classic case where the evidence is not all that strong."  Nonetheless, 
Lippmann asserted, the "weight of the evidence" supports the risk 
assessment's conclusions (Passive Smoke A Cause of Cancer, Panel Concludes, 
The Washington Post, December 6, 1990, p. A9).
           
                3.   SAB Executive Committee Meeting, April 1991
           
                Dr. Lippmann presented the SAB panel's report to the SAB's 
Executive Committee meeting in April 1991.  This report was curious for 
several reasons.  First, the SAB concluded that the worldwide epidemiologic 
data on ETS were too weak and inconclusive to support the draft risk 
assessment's conclusion that ETS is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers.  In 
addition, the panel did not endorse the Agency's quantitative lung cancer 
analysis, noting that the "real" number "may be greater or less than the 
number EPA cites."
 
                After concluding that the rationale underlying the EPA 
staff's conclusions about lung cancer could not be sustained, however, the 
SAB could not bring itself to take the logical, if politically unpalatable, 
next step and reject EPA's conclusions regarding ETS and lung cancer among 
nonsmokers.  Instead, the SAB endorsed the conclusion that ETS is a "Group A" 
carcinogen while taking the extraordinary step of urging the EPA staff to 
attempt to "make the case" against ETS based on extrapolation from data 
concerning active smoking.  In essence, the Agency was being encouraged to do 
the science backwards -- to maintain its conclusion while going about the 
task of finding support for it.
           
                Not surprisingly, the SAB report did not acknowledge that EPA 
had largely ignored its own "Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment," 
51 Fed. Reg. 3394 (September 24, 1986), in order to reach its apparently 
predetermined position.  Among many violations of the guidelines, EPA had 
failed to rule out the possibility of bias and other flaws in the ETS studies 
and also had failed to consider animal studies and other non-epidemiologic 
data.
           
                The SAB's report feebly suggested that the panel "had some 
difficulty in applying the 'Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment', as 
they are currently formulated," to the ETS data.  Particular attention was 
given to the report's statement that "[i]f the guidelines for Carcinogen Risk 
Assessment can be used to cast doubt on a finding that inhalation of tobacco 
smoke by humans causes an increased risk of lung cancer, the situation 
suggests a need to revise the guidelines" (SAB Rep. 28).  This prompted one 
member of the SAB Executive Committee to note that it sounded a little like 
saying "if the data doesn't fit the guidelines, the guidelines should be 
changed."  Nevertheless, the Committee accepted the panel's Group A 
designation despite the clear failure of the data to satisfy the Agency's own 
guidelines.
           
                Following the Executive Committee meeting, Dr. Lippmann once 
again spoke to the press about the SAB's conclusions.  This time Dr. 
Lippmann's statements were considerably more restrained than his remarks at 
the December 1990 press conference.  This time he stated that "occasional,
light exposure [to ETS] is not likely to cause any harm" (United Press 
International, April 19, 1991).  Dr. Lippmann also observed that in his view 
the risk due to ETS exposure is "probably much less than you took to get here 
through Washington traffic" (Washington Times, April 19, 1991, p. A-3).  On 
three separate occasions my staff asked Dr. Lippmann, "if one were to apply 
the guidelines as written could you classify ETS as a Class A known human 
carcinogen?" On all three occasions, Dr. Lippmann failed to respond to the 
question.  The next day, however, Dr. Lippmann stated at a meeting outside 
the glare of media attention that if the guidelines were applied strictly 
there was no clear mechanistic basis for calling ETS carcinogenic.
 
                4.   The Second Draft Risk Assessment
           
                EPA staff spent the next year and a half attempting to "make 
a case" against ETS.  The revised risk assessment draft was over 600 pages 
long, finally being issued on the afternoon of June 18, 1992.(26)  
Incredibly, however, EPA gave the public just nine working days to comment on 
it even though the report had doubled in length and a whole new set of flaws 
had been introduced.  Even the Science Advisory Board panel had only until 
July 20 to review the revised draft and consider outside comments before the 
public review meeting.
           
                The second draft risk assessment was even more curious than 
the first.  As an EPA health scientist who contributed to the draft admitted, 
the Agency staff had engaged in some "fancy statistical footwork" in the 
revised risk assessment in order to "fashion [an] indictment" of ETS 
(Science, vol. 257,  p. 607 (July 31, 1992)).  In the prior draft, EPA's 
calculations had showed that the epidemiologic studies based on U.S. 
populations showed no statistically significant association between ETS and 
lung cancer among nonsmokers.  In order to reach a statistically significant
result in the first draft, EPA therefore had included in its calculations all 
of the studies of ETS conducted worldwide to tilt the balance in the favored 
direction.  Both EPA and the SAB rejected out of hand arguments by critics 
that the risk assessment should have considered only the U.S. studies.
           
                When EPA staff was revising the risk assessment, however, it 
was confronted by the Wu-Williams/Blot study, which had been conducted in 
China and reported a statistically significant negative association between 
marriage to a smoker and lung cancer among nonsmokers -- the exposure 
scenario relied upon in the initial risk assessment draft.  Inclusion of the 
Wu-Williams/Blot study in EPA's analysis would have forced EPA to reverse its 
conclusions about ETS and lung cancer.  At the same time, however, EPA had 
obtained preliminary data from a large U.S. study that, with some massaging, 
could be used to support its calculations of risk based exclusively on the 
U.S. studies.
           
                Accordingly, EPA entirely reversed course and decided in the 
second draft to disregard the non-U.S. studies.  Instead, EPA used the U.S. 
studies only.  The Agency also adopted an entirely new standard of 
statistical significance, presumably because the one used in the prior draft 
would not have yielded the desired results, even with the inclusion of the 
new, if incomplete, U.S. study.(27)  Only by manipulating the numbers in a 
manner that violated well-accepted statistical methods was EPA able to claim 
in the second draft a barely significant association in the U.S. studies.
           
                The new draft also relied on the argument suggested by the 
SAB that because active smoking had been associated with increases in risk, 
ETS exposure also must be a risk factor.  The problem with this argument -- 
that ETS is in many respects a very different substance and is encountered at 
far lower levels -- was acknowledged in the revised report.(28)  At the same 
time, however, its significance seemed to escape those responsible for the 
report's conclusions.
 
                Similarly, the second draft risk assessment announced that 
ETS exposure had been established as a cause of respiratory disease in 
children.  The first draft risk assessment had stated that the data were too 
inconclusive to draw an inference of causation.  No new information became
available between the release of the first and second draft risk assessment 
to support this shift in the Agency's position.  Apparently, EPA staff took 
the SAB's earlier suggestion that it consider "strengthening" the report's 
conclusions concerning children as a license to sensationalize further the 
Agency's claims about ETS.
           
                The SAB held public hearings on the revised risk assessment 
on July 21 and 22, 1992, after having denied requests for more time to submit 
public comments on these and other problems.  The panel submitted its report 
approving the second risk assessment in October.  The panel's conclusions
make absolutely clear that it was unconcerned with the scientific soundness 
of the report's underlying rationale.  A brief comparison of the SAB's 
actions following its first and second review of the risk assessment confirms 
that the SAB actually disregarded its earlier findings in order to embrace
the desired conclusion.
 
        -    The SAB concluded in its second review that
             extrapolation from active smoking data could
             not, after all, serve as the sole or predomi-
             nant basis for the conclusion that ETS is a
             Group A carcinogen.

        -    The SAB had concluded in its first review that
             the epidemiologic data were too weak to support
             the inference that exposure to ETS causes lung
             cancer in nonsmokers.  The SAB reversed its
             position in its review of the second draft risk
             assessment once it became clear that active
             smoking data could not provide an alternative
             basis for that conclusion.

        -    The SAB concluded in its review of the first risk
             assessment that all studies of ETS and lung cancer
             conducted worldwide should be included.  In the
             second review, the SAB decided that EPA need only
             include the U.S. studies.  Had the Agency and the
             SAB adhered to their original decision to use all
             ETS studies, the meta-analysis would not have shown
             a statistically significant risk.

        -    The SAB nonetheless concluded that the Agency
             had established that ETS is a Group A carcino-
             gen responsible for approximately 3000 lung
             cancer cases every year in the United States.
             In the first review, the SAB had concluded that
             the data were too uncertain for EPA to attach a
             specific number to the deaths supposedly
             attributable to exposure to ETS.
          
                Put simply, the SAB concluded that ETS is a Group A
carcinogen even though neither of the two rationales advanced by EPA staff to 
justify such classification is scientifically defensible.  The first review 
determined that the spousal smoking studies were too weak to support an 
inference of causation.  The second review concluded that the active smoking 
data could not be used as an alternative ground.  Nonetheless, the SAB 
decided that the total "weight of evidence" supported a Group A 
classification.
          
                Following the SAB's October report, EPA staff rushed to 
revise and release the final risk assessment.  The Agency's haste apparently 
was motivated in part by the impending change in the Administration.  Perhaps 
of even greater concern to EPA, however, was the release of the Brownson 
study discussed above.  The fact that the largest U.S. case-control study 
ever conducted reported no statistically significant association between ETS 
exposure and lung cancer incidence casts further doubt on EPA's claims.  Had 
the Brownson study been included in EPA's analysis, the Agency's calculations 
would not have shown a significant risk from ETS even using the Agency's 
highly suspect statistical methodology.  Rather than face this embarrassment, 
EPA rushed to release the report without considering the Brownson study on 
the pretext that "it had to stop somewhere."(29)
           
                Together, EPA and the SAB have undermined the process by 
which risk assessments ought to be conducted:  first, by ignoring the 
substantial scientific controversy about what the ETS studies actually show; 
and, second, by conducting the forum where that controversy should have been 
thoroughly aired as a mere rubber stamp proceeding.  As a result, EPA's 
preparation and review of the risk assessment have given the appearance of a 
scientific show trial to legitimize a predetermined policy.
 

III. CONCLUSIONS
 
                EPA's handling of ETS is a symptom, albeit a very severe one, 
of larger agency problems.  These problems encompass not only widespread 
abuses in the award and oversight of government contracts but also the 
Agency's general approach to the use of science in policy making.  

                In fact, EPA's risk assessment process as a whole has come 
under fire.  In response, top EPA management moved to revamp internal 
guidelines governing EPA's use of science in risk assessments.  In February 
1992, Deputy Administrator Henry Habicht issued a document providing 
agency-wide guidance on science policy in risk assessment and risk 
characterization.  Mr. Habicht noted that significant information often was 
omitted as assessment documents were passed along in the decision-making 
process, and that "EPA risk assessors and managers need to be completely 
candid about confidence and uncertainties in describing risks and in 
explaining regulatory decisions."
 
                The guidance also drew from principles articulated earlier by 
the Risk Assessment Council in November 1991, such as the following.
 
                For users of the assessment and for
                decision-makers who integrate these
                assessments into regulatory decisions, the
                distinction between risk assessment and
                risk management means refraining from
                influencing the risk description through
                consideration of non-scientific factors --
                e.g., the regulatory outcome -- and from
                attempting to shape the risk assessment to
                avoid statutory constraints, meet
                regulatory objectives, or serve political
                purposes.  Such management considerations
                are often legitimate considerations for
                the overall regulatory decision * * * but
                they have no role in estimating or
                describing risk.(30)
          
In other words, science should drive policy, not the other way around.
          
                In addition to the new risk assessment guidance, as I 
mentioned at the outset, the EPA Administrator also had convened an expert 
panel to assess EPA's use of science, which issued an important report in 
March 1992 entitled "Safeguarding the Future:  Credible Science, Credible 
Decisions."  The report confirmed that "[c]urrently, EPA science is of uneven 
quality, and the Agency's policies and regulations are frequently perceived 
as lacking a strong scientific foundation" (p. 4).
          
                The expert panel also cautioned EPA, in terms that are 
directly relevant to the Agency's work on ETS, that "science should never be 
adjusted to fit policy, either consciously or unconsciously" (p. 38).  
Unfortunately, in the case of ETS there appears to have been a conscious use 
of science and the scientific process to achieve a political agenda that 
could not otherwise be justified.  

                While we should applaud the promised willingness of EPA to 
clean house and revise its methods, we also must question why that was not 
done in the case of the ETS risk assessment.  In his February 1992 policy 
memorandum, the Deputy Administrator wrote, "we do not expect risk assessment 
documents that are close to completion to be rewritten" (p. 5).  It is 
difficult to understand why, after acknowledging serious deficiencies in 
EPA's use of science, the Agency would refuse to correct the flaws in risk 
assessment projects then under way.  Similarly, EPA repeatedly has refused to 
respond to requests that it reevaluate its handling of the ETS controversy in 
general and the risk assessment in particular in light of the recommendations 
contained in "Credible Science."  This refusal raises questions about EPA's 
ability and desire to implement fully the reforms urged by "Credible 
Science."
           
                It also is deeply disturbing that Administrator Reilly, who 
professed to be "proud" of "Credible Science," did not choose to abide by its 
recommendations in his own statements about the ETS risk assessment.  As 
noted, continuing the pattern of media hype and sensationalism that has 
marked every aspect of EPA's consideration of ETS, Administrator Reilly and 
HHS Secretary Sullivan held a joint press conference on January 7, 1993, 
announcing the finalization of the risk assessment.  The press conference 
proceeded as though the "Credible Science" report and recommendations did not 
exist.
           
                One of the important conclusions of "Credible Science" is 
that EPA has done a poor job in communicating with the public about the 
uncertainties in its determinations.  In addition, the Agency's own guidance 
document emphasizes the importance of explaining fully scientific 
uncertainties in describing risks.  At the January 1993 ETS press conference,
however, the Administrator conveyed the clear impression that there is no 
uncertainty whatsoever so far as ETS is concerned --  that the risk 
assessment has shown "conclusively" that ETS exposure is responsible for 
approximately 3,000 cases of lung cancer among U.S. nonsmokers each year and 
specific numbers of respiratory problems among children.(31)  The 
Administrator also made the ridiculous statement that "the risks associated 
with environmental tobacco smoke are at least an order of magnitude greater 
than they are for virtually any chemical or risk that EPA regulates."(32)  
Among other things, that statement cannot possibly be reconciled with Dr. 
Lippmann's earlier statement that the risk supposedly associated with ETS is 
less than the risk of a single trip through Washington traffic.
           
                Finally, the Administrator disingenuously claimed that "[m]y 
philosophy is, first do the scientific analysis, and only then build the 
policy, determine the priority and devise the strategy based on a firm 
scientific foundation.  With this report we have laid the firm foundation 
upon which policy can now be built."(33)  The fact that EPA released, several 
years ago, a "Fact Sheet" and a draft policy guide recommending smoking bans 
and restrictions renders the Administrator's statement misleading at best.

                Some may argue that applying a double standard to ETS is 
justifiable, or at least understandable, on the ground that the target of 
EPA's action is tobacco smoking.  Regardless of one's personal beliefs about 
smoking, however, the spectacle of a huge, well-funded government bureaucracy 
with enormous power engaged in the deliberate manipulation of the public is 
profoundly disturbing.
 
                Further, if policy decisions are not based on sound science, 
the integrity of both the political and the scientific processes suffers.  As 
Dr. Feinstein has pointed out --
 
                [t]he "bad guys" * * * are not always
                right, but if they are denied a fair and
                proper scientific hearing, neither society
                nor science will benefit.  Society is
                entitled to make political decisions based
                on advocacy.  The scientific basis for
                those decisions however, should depend not
                on political advocacy, but on scholar-
                ship -- no matter how it is produced or by
                whom (p. 305).
          
                These concerns are not limited to ETS.  The suspicion that 
too many scientists and government officials are using "scare of the month" 
tactics to generate media attention and mobilize public opinion in support of 
personal political agendas has fueled widespread public cynicism.  At some 
point, people simply stop paying attention.  As the public television program 
"Technopolitics" noted in its June 11, 1991, program on the first draft of 
the ETS risk assessment --
 
                [t]he question remains whether the public
                health scare now being created through
                leaked draft documents and emotional
                public appeals is real, or is the anti-
                smoking movement merely using bad science
                to organize the nonsmoking majority
                against the smoking minority?

                The record of the EPA is not reassuring.
                On one environmental concern after
                another, from Alar apples to acid rain to
                dioxin, the EPA has first put out alarming
                information and then backed off.  Critics
                charge that the EPA is more interested in
                being politically correct than scientifi-
                cally accurate.
          
                In essence, EPA has declared war on smokers.  Because of 
EPA's pursuit of sensational headlines at the expense of objective scientific 
evaluation, some smokers have lost their jobs and many employers are 
practicing overt discrimination in hiring and promotion based solely on 
whether a person smokes.  People who think that such interference is unlikely 
to go beyond smoking should be warned:  a report last year on the television 
show "20/20" indicated that moderate social drinking off the job and 
participation in employer-defined "dangerous activities" also have become 
targets of workplace discrimination policies.  Can a government-sponsored 
"technical compendium" or "policy guide" on those subjects be far behind?

                EPA's mandate to clean up the nation's air, water, and waste 
enjoys public support.  But conduct by the Agency like its handling of ETS 
will continue to undermine that support unless the Agency decides to get 
serious about implementing the recommendations of "Credible Science."  If 
EPA's leaders will not step up to the task of reforming from within, it will 
become necessary for Congress to do the job for them.

(6)     Ibid.  In addition to these deficiencies, classification of ETS as a 
        Group A carcinogen cannot be reconciled with EPA's own "Guidelines 
        for Carcinogen Risk Assessment."  The Scientific Advisory Board that 
        reviewed the risk assessment acknowledged that the document did not 
        adhere to the Agency's guidelines, but dismissed such concerns with 
        the suggestion that the guidelines simply be changed.  The report 
        also selectively uses data that support its conclusions while 
        omitting evidence that does not.  For example, the report completely 
        ignores workplace and male exposure data, which do not show any 
        association between exposure to ETS and lung cancer.

        Such treatment by both EPA and the SAB is unprecedented.  No other 
        substance has been classified as a Group A carcinogen in the face of 
        a clear majority of epidemiologic studies showing no statistically 
        significant association or on an assumed similarity with another 
        substance.  Other substances that have been considered for 
        classification as known or probable human carcinogens, including 
        electromagnetic fields and diesel exhaust, have been accompanied by 
        considerably stronger evidence of carcinogenicity in both human and 
        animal studies than ETS. Comparing those risk assessments to the ETS 
        report only reinforces the view that the report is intended to 
        support a policy decision to restrict ETS exposure and not to assess 
        risk objectively.

(7)     The risk assessment does not address the data concerning ETS exposure 
        and cardiovascular disease.  Two earlier documents prepared by EPA 
        staff, however, an ETS "technical compendium" and a related 
        "workplace policy guide," asserted that ETS exposure is a cause of 
        cardiovascular disease.  In fact, exposure to ETS has not been proven 
        to cause or exacerbate cardiovascular disease among nonsmokers.  In 
        1986, the U.S. Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences 
        reviewed the data and concluded that there was insufficient evidence 
        even of an association between ETS and cardiovascular disease.  U.S. 
        Surgeon General, "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking," 
        U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (1986); National 
        Research Council, "Environmental Tobacco Smoke:  Measuring Exposures 
        and Assessing Health Effects" (1986).  No studies have been published 
        since 1986 that would alter their conclusions.

(18)    This statement was contained in an undated background summary of the 
        risk assessment entitled "Findings in a Nutshell," prepared by EPA 
        sometime in mid-l991.  The summary was given to the Occupational 
        Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency that has 
        authority to regulate indoor air quality in the workplace.

(19)    According to his resume, Mr. Rosner has a bachelor of science degree 
        in occupational therapy and a master's degree in business

        restaurant manager, recruitment coordinator of Big Brothers/Big 
        Sisters of Tacoma, radio announcer, founder of an organization "to 
        tackle Seattle's rising crime rate" and as Executive Director of the 
        Smoking Policy Institute.  Nothing in Mr. Rosner's education or 
        professional background suggests that he is "uniquely" qualified to 
        assess the "technical and scientific literature on tobacco smoke 
        exposure and health impacts," as was claimed in an undated memorandum 
        purporting to justify the award of the policy guide subcontract to 
        SPI on a sole-source basis.

(20)    A June 1991 Report by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and 
        Investigations identifies ICF as one of EPA's ten largest 
        contractors, with active contracts having a potential total value of 
        more than $300 million.  The Report notes that audits of ICF's work, 
        performed for EPA by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, had found 
        "numerous problems," including instances in which ICF billed EPA for 
        subcontractor charges before ICF had paid the subcontractors 
        (Report, p. 25).  Apparently, EPA also has made it a practice to use 
        ICF as a vehicle to provide subcontracts to consultants selected by 
        EPA.  As indicated earlier, EPA's cozy relationship with its 
        contractors and negligent management practices in connection with 
        contracting procedures have been the subject of an ongoing 
        investigation by the Oversight Subcommittee.

(24)    Drs. Benowitz, Blot, Eatough, Hammond, Kabat, Lebowitz, Samet and 
        Weiss had been responsible for scientific studies concerning ETS 
        cited in the first or second drafts of the risk assessment.

(25)    Dr. Rockette, for example, observed that "there is this issue of the 
        bias and potentially the systematic bias which the meta-analysis will 
        not control for * * *.  [Y]ou are dealing with an estimate of risk 
        [of] about thirty percent * * *.  [M]ost epidemiologists, if they did 
        a single study where they got a thirty percent risk, even if it 
        [were] statistically significant, [would] not be very excited about 
        it" (II, p. 19).  Even Dr. Samet concluded that "the [lung cancer] 
        chapter falls far short of doing an adequate job of hazard 
        identification and needs to go much further, in light of the Agency's 
        guidelines on hazard identification * * *" (II, p. 30).
 
        With respect to the quantitative risk estimates, the panel voiced 
        even stronger doubts.  Dr. Wesolowski stated that he thought "what 
        we're hearing is that we are a little bit weak on exposure, to say 
        the least, and there's going to be a need for a lot of research" (II, 
        p. 82).  Dr. Blot agreed, noting that "we're less sure than the 
        chapter presents as to the actual numbers of lung cancer deaths that 
        are due to environmental tobacco smoke * * * " (II, p. 87).  He also 
        felt that the inclusion of ex-smokers in the draft's risk estimates 
        was "really poorly justified" (II, p. 94).  Dr. Laties, one of the 
        few panelists who actually had read the public comments, strongly 
        recommended that a Japanese study by Dr. Hirayama be dropped based on 
        what he characterized as "devastating" criticism by Dr. Kilpatrick, 
        one of the outside scientists who had reviewed and commented on the 
        draft (II, p. 99).  EPA's risk estimates in the first draft depended 
        heavily on this early, extremely controversial study.

(26)    The second draft revealed for the first time that the authors of 
        several of the chapters had acted as subcontractors to ICF 
        Incorporated.  As noted earlier, the EPA Inspector General has 
        concluded that all of those subcontracts were awarded non-
        competitively and that at least two violated federal contracting 
        procedures.  In addition, as with the technical compendium and 
        policy guide, some of the people who contributed to the revised ETS 
        risk assessment are vocal antismoking activists.  Judson Wells, who 
        contributed an important appendix to the revised risk assessment on 
        smoker misclassification rates, is a retired chemist who now devotes
        most if not all of his time to doing volunteer work for the American 
        Lung Association on the ETS issue.  Wells' claims about 
        misclassification rates were of vital importance to the lung cancer 
        conclusions of the revised risk assessment.

(27)    Specifically, the revised risk assessment used a 90% confidence 
        interval to judge statistical significance even though (1) a 95% 
        confidence interval had been utilized in all of the underlying 
        studies, (2) a 95% confidence interval is the more accepted measure 
        and (3) EPA had not previously utilized a 90% standard in any 
        previous risk assessment.  EPA has never attempted to explain this 
        departure from previous and accepted scientific practice.  One 
        commentator noted that "[t]o get scientifically valid data, there are 
        very strict rules and requirements on how and when you can apply 
        meta-analysis, and virtually all of them were violated in the EPA 
        analysis."  Investors' Business Daily, supra note 1.

(28)    The draft report stated, for example, that "[t]his assumption 
        [comparing MS and ETS to calculate lung cancer risks] may not be 
        tenable, * * * as MS and SS differ in the relative composition of 
        carcinogens and other components identified in tobacco smoke and in 
        their physicochemical properties in general * * *" (p. 6-6).  The 
        draft report also acknowledged that "[t]he concentration of smoke 
        components inhaled by subjects exposed to ETS is small compared with 
        that from active smoking. * * * Breathing patterns for inhalation of 
        mainstream smoke and ETS differ considerably * * *.  There are also 
        important differences in the physicochemical properties of ETS and MS 
        (see chapter 3).  These have been extensively reviewed earlier by the 
        National Research Council * * * and the Surgeon General * * *"  
        (pp. 7-2; 7-3).

(29)    As noted, EPA "stopped" in a most curious place.  It fully 
        incorporates data from a still incomplete study by Elizabeth Fontham 
        and coworker while ignoring the much larger, complete and fully 
        reported Brownson study -- which had been funded in part by NCI.  In 
        addition to having several years to run, Dr. Fontham and her group 
        have not yet published any data on ETS/lung cancer confounding 
        factors.

The Sociology of Prohibition <br>
or <br>
The History of the Non-Medical Use of Drugs in the United States <br>
by Charles Whitebread
</center>

A Speech to the California Judges Association 1995 annual
conference
<p>
This session is going to be about the history of the
non-medical use of drugs. Let me say that, because this is
going to be a story, that I think will interest you quite a
bit.  The topic is the history of the non-medical use of drugs
and I think you ought to know what my credentials are for
talking about this topic.  As you may know, before I taught at
the University of Southern California, I taught at the
University of Virginia for fifteen years, from 1968 to 1981.
In that time period, the very first major piece that I wrote
was a piece entitled, "The Forbidden Fruit and the Tree of
Knowledge - The Legal History of marijuana in the United
States."  I wrote it with Professor Richard Bonnie, still
of the faculty of the University of Virginia. It was
published in the Virginia Law Review in October of 1970 and I
must say that our piece was the Virginia Law Review in October
of 1970.  The piece was 450 pages long.  It got a ton of
national attention because no one had ever done the legal
history of marijuana before. As a result of that, Professor
Bonnie was named the Deputy Director of the National
Commission on marijuana and Drug Abuse and I was a consultant
to that commission.
<p>
As a result of Richard's two year executive directorship of
the National Commission in 1971 and 1972 he and I were given
access to both the open and the closed files of what was then
called the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, what had
historically been called the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and
what today is called the Drug Enforcement Agency. Based upon
our access to those files, both open and closed, we wrote a
book called "The marijuana Conviction- The Legal History of
Drugs in the United States" and that book went through six
printings at the University of Virginia press before being
sold out primarily in sales to my friends at the FBI over the
years.  It is based upon that work that I bring you this story.
<p>
If you are interested in the non-medical use of drugs in this
country, the time to go back to is 1900, and in some ways the
most important thing I am going to say to you guys I will say
first.  That is, that in 1900 there were far more people
addicted to drugs in this country than there are today.
Depending upon whose judgment, or whose assessment, you accept
there were between two and five percent of the entire adult
population of the United States addicted to drugs in 1900.
<p>
Now, there were two principal causes of this dramatic level of
drug addiction at the turn of the century.  The first cause
was the use of morphine and its various derivatives in
legitimate medical operations.  You know as late as 1900
particularly in areas where medical resources were scarce it
was not at all uncommon for you to say, let's say you would
have appendicitis, you would go into the hospital, and you
would get morphine as a pain killer during the operation, you
would be given morphine further after the operation and you
would come out of the hospital with no appendix but addicted
to morphine.
<p>
  The use of morphine in battlefield operations during the
Civil War was so extensive that, by 1880, so many Union
veterans were addicted to morphine that the popular press
referred to morphinism as the "soldier's disease". Now I will
say, being from Virginia as I am, that the Confederate veterans
didn't have any problems about being addicted to morphine
because the South was too poor to have any, and therefore
battlefield operations on the Confederate Army were simply
done by chopping off the relevant limb while they drank a
little whiskey.  But the Northern troops heavily found
themselves, as the result of battlefield operations and the
use of morphine, addicted to morphine.
<p>
Now, the other fact that I think that is so interesting about
drug addiction at the turn of the century, as opposed to today
is who the addicts were, because they were the exact opposite
of who you would think most likely to be an addict today.  If
I were to ask you in terms of statistical groups who is most
likely to be involved with drugs today, you would say a young
person, a male, who lives in the city and who may be a
minority group member.  That is the exact opposite of who was
most likely to be addicted to drugs at the turn of the century.
<p>
In terms of statistical groups, who was most likely to be
addicted to drugs at the turn of the century?  A rural
living, middle-aged white woman. The use of morphine in
medical operations does not explain the much higher incidence
of drug addiction among women.  What does is the second cause
of the high level of addiction at the turn of the century -
the growth and development of what we now call the "patent
medicine" industry.
<p>
I think some of you, maybe from watching Westerns on TV if
nothing else are aware that, again, as late as 1900, in areas,
particularly rural areas where medical resources were scarce,
it was typical for itinerant salesmen, not themselves doctors,
to cruise around the countryside offering potions and elixirs
of all sorts advertised in the most flamboyant kinds of terms.
"Doctor Smith's Oil, Good for What Ails You," or "Doctor
Smith's Oil, Good for Man or Beast."
<p>
Well, what the purveyors of these medicines did not tell their
purchasers, was that later, when these patent medicines were
tested, many of them proved to be up to fifty percent morphine
by volume.
<p>
Now, what that meant, as I have always thought, was the
most significant thing about the high morphine content in
patent medicines was it meant they tended to live up to their
advertising. Because no matter what is wrong with you, or your
beast, you are going to feel a whole lot better after a couple
of slugs of an elixir that is fifty percent morphine.  So
there was this tendency to think "Wow!  This stuff works."
Down you could go to the general store and get more of it and
it could be sold to you directly over the counter. Now, for
reasons that we weren't able to full research, but for
reasons, I think, probably associated with the role of women
rural societies then patent medicines were much more appealing
to women than  to men and account for the much higher
incidence of drug addiction in 1900 among women than among men.
<p>
If you want to see a relatively current portrayal of a woman
addicted to patent medicine you might think of Eugene
O'Neil's play "A Long Day's Journey Into Night."  The mother
figure there, the one that was played by Katherine Hepburn in
the movies was addicted to patent medicines. In any event, the
use of morphine in medical operations and the sale of patent
medicines accounted for a dramatic level of addiction.  Again,
between two and five percent of the entire adult population of
the United States was addicted to drugs as late as 1900.
<p>
Now if my first point is that there was a lot more addiction
in 1900 than there is today and that the people who were
addicted are quite a different group than the group we would
be thinking of today,  my next point would be that if you look
at drug addiction in 1900, what's the number one way in which
it is different than drug addiction today? Answer:  Almost all
addiction at the turn of the century was accidental.
<p>
People became involved with drugs they did not know that they
were taking, that they did not know the impact of.  The first
point, then, is that there was more drug addiction than there
is now and most of it was accidental. Then the single law
which has done the most in this country to reduce the level of
drug addiction is none of the criminal laws we have ever
passed. The single law that reduced drug addiction the most
was the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act.
<p>
The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 did three things:
<p>
1). It created the Food and Drug Administration in Washington
that must approve all foods and drugs meant for human
consumption.  The very first impact of that was that the
patent medicines were not approved for human consumption once
they were tested.
<p>
2)  The Pure Food and Drug Act said that certain drugs could
only be sold on prescription.
<p>
3)  The Pure Food and Drug Act, (and you know, this is still
true today, go look in your medicine chest) requires that any
drug that can be potentially habit-forming say so on it's
label.  "Warning - May be habit forming." The labeling
requirements, the prescription requirements, and the refusal
to approve the patent medicines basically put the patent
medicine business out of business and reduced that dramatic
source of accidental addiction.  The Pure Food and Drug Act
of 1906, not a criminal law, did more to reduce the level of
addiction than any other single statute we have passed in all
of the times from then to now.
<p>
The very first criminal law at the Federal level in this
country to criminalize the non-medical use of drugs  came in
1914.  It was called the Harrison Act and there are only three
things about the Harrison Act that we need to focus on today.
<p>
Number one is the date.  Did you hear the date, 1914?  Some of
you may have come this morning thinking that we have used the
criminal law to deal with the non-medical use of drugs since
the beginning of the Republic or something.  That is not true.
The entire experiment of using the criminal sanction to deal
with the non-medical use of drugs really began in this country
in 1914 with the Harrison Act.
<p>
The second interesting thing about the Harrison Act was the
drugs to which it applied, because it applied to almost none
of the drugs we would be concerned about today.  The Harrison
Act applied to opium, morphine and its various derivatives,
and the derivatives of the coca leaf like cocaine.  No mention
anywhere there of amphetamines, barbiturates, marijuana,
hashish, hallucinogenic drugs of any kind.  The Harrison Act
applied only to opium, morphine and its various derivatives
and derivatives of the coca leaf like cocaine.
<p>
The third and most interesting thing for you all as judges
about the Harrison Act was its structure,  because the
structure of this law was very peculiar and became the model
for every single piece of Federal legislation from 1914 right
straight through 1969. And what was that model?
<p>
It was called the Harrison Tax Act. You know, the drafters of
the Harrison Act said very clearly on the floor of Congress
what it was they wanted to achieve. They had two goals.  They
wanted to regulate the medical use of these drugs and they
wanted to criminalize the non-medical use of these drugs.
They had one problem.  Look at the date - 1914. 1914 was
probably the high water mark of the constitutional doctrine we
today call "states' rights" and, therefore, it was widely
thought Congress did not have the power, number one, to
regulate a particular profession, and number two, that
Congress did not have the power to pass what was, and is still
known, as a general criminal law.  That's why there were so
few Federal Crimes until very recently.
<p>
In the face of possible Constitutional opposition to what they
wanted to do, the people in Congress who supported the Harrison
Act came up with a novel idea. That is, they would masquerade
this whole thing as though it were a tax. To show you how it
worked, can I use some hypothetical figures to show you how
this alleged tax worked?
<p>
There were two taxes.  The first (and again, these figures
aren't accurate but they will do to show the idea) tax was
paid by doctors.  It was a dollar a year and the doctors,
in exchange for paying that one dollar tax, got a stamp from
the Government that allowed them to prescribe these drugs for
their patients so long as they followed the regulations in the
statute.  Do you see that by the payment of that one dollar
tax, we have the doctors regulated? The doctors have to follow
the regulations in the statute. And there was a second tax.
(and again, these are hypothetical figures but they will show
you how it worked.) was a tax of a thousand dollars of every
single non-medical exchange of every one of these drugs.
Well, since nobody was going to pay a thousand dollars in tax
to exchange something which, in 1914, even in large quantities
was worth about five dollars, the second tax wasn't a tax
either, it was a criminal prohibition. Now just to be sure you
guys understand this, and I am sure you do, but just to make
sure, let's say that in 1915 somebody was found, let's say,
in possession of an ounce of cocaine out here on the street.
What would be the Federal crime?  Not possession of cocaine,
or possession of a controlled substance. What was the crime?
Tax evasion.
<p>
And do you see what a wicked web that is going to be?  As a
quick preview, where then are we going to put the law
enforcement arm for the criminalization of drugs for over
forty years - in what department? The Treasury Department.
Why, we are just out there collecting taxes and I will
show you how that works in a minute.
<p>
If you understand that taxing scheme then you understand why
the national marijuana prohibition of 1937 was called the
marijuana Tax Act. But before we get to that next big piece
of Federal legislation, the marijuana prohibition of 1937,
I would like to take a little detour, if I may, into an
analysis of the early state marijuana laws passed in this
country from 1915 to 1937.
<p>
Let me pause to tell you this.  When Professor Bonnie and I
set out to try, to track the legal history of marijuana in
this country, we were shocked that nobody had ever done that
work before. And, secondly, the few people who had even
conjectured about it went back to the 1937 Federal Act and
said "Well, there's the beginning of it."  No.  If you go back
to 1937, that fails to take account of the fact that, in the
period from 1915 to 1937, some 27 states passed criminal laws
against the use of marijuana.  What Professor Bonnie and I did
was, unique to our work, to go back to the legislative records
in those states and back to the newspapers in the state
capitols at the time these laws were passed to try to find out
what motivated these 27 states to enact criminal laws against
the use of marijuana.  What we found was that the 27 states
divided into three groups by explanation.
<p>
The first group of states to have marijuana laws in that part
of the century were Rocky Mountain and southwestern states.
By that, I mean Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana.  You
didn't have to go anywhere but to the legislative records to
find out what had motivated those marijuana laws. The only
thing you need to know to understand the early marijuana
laws in the southwest and Rocky Mountain areas of this country
is to know, that in the period just after 1914, into all of
those areas was a substantial migration of Mexicans.  They had
come across the border in search of better economic
conditions, they worked heavily as rural laborers, beet field
workers, cotton pickers, things of that sort.  And with them,
they had brought marijuana.
<p>
Basically, none of the white people in these states knew
anything about marijuana, and I make a distinction between
white people and Mexicans to reflect a distinction that any
legislator in one of these states at the time would have made.
And all you had to do to find out what motivated the marijuana
laws in the Rocky mountain and southwestern states was to go to
the legislative records themselves. Probably the best single
statement was the statement of a proponent of Texas first
marijuana law.  He said on the floor of the Texas Senate, and I
quote, "All Mexicans are crazy, and this stuff (referring to
marijuana) is what makes them crazy."  Or, as the proponent of
Montana's first marijuana law said, (and imagine this on the
floor of the state legislature) and I quote, "Give one of
these Mexican beet field workers a couple of puffs on a
marijuana cigarette and he thinks he is in the bullring at
Barcelona."
<p>
Well, there is was, you didn't have to look another foot as
you went from state to state right on the floor of the state
legislature.  And so what was the genesis for the early state
marijuana laws in the Rocky Mountain and southwestern areas of
this country? It wasn't hostility to the drug, it was
hostility to the newly arrived Mexican community that used it.
<p>
A second group  of states that had criminal laws against the
use of marijuana were in the Northeast, Connecticut, Rhode
Island, New York - had one and then repealed it and then had
one again - New Jersey.  Well, clearly no hypothesis about
Mexican immigration will explain the genesis of those laws
because, as you know, the Northeast has never had, still
doesn't really, any substantial Mexican-American population.
So we had to dig a little deeper to find the genesis of those
laws.  We had to go not only to the legislative records but to
the newspapers in the state capitols at the time these laws
were passed and what we found, in the early marijuana laws
in the Northeast, we labeled the "fear of substitution."  If
I may, let me paraphrase an editorial from the New York Times
in 1919 so we will get exactly the flavor of this fear of
substitution.
<p>
The New York Times in an editorial in 1919 said, "No one here
in  New York uses this drug marijuana.  We have only just
heard about it from down in the Southwest," and here comes the
substitution.  "But," said the New York Times, "we had better
prohibit its use before it gets here.  Otherwise" - here's the
substitution concept - "all the heroin and hard narcotics
addicts cut off from their drug by the Harrison Act and all
the alcohol drinkers cut off from their drug by 1919 alcohol
Prohibition will substitute this new and unknown drug
marijuana for the drugs they used to use."
<p>
Well, from state to state, on the theory that this newly
encountered drug marijuana would be substituted by the hard
narcotics addicts or by the alcohol drinkers for their
previous drug that had been prohibited, state to state this
fear of substitution carried, and that accounted for 26 of the
27 states - that is, either the anti-Mexican sentiment in the
Southwest and Rocky Mountain areas or fear of substitution in
the Northeast. That accounted for 26 of the 27 states, and
there was only one state left over. It was the most important
state for us because it was the first state ever to enact a
criminal law against the use of marijuana and it was the state
of Utah.
<p>
Now, if you have been hearing this story and you have been
playing along with me,  you think "Oh, wait a minute,
Whitebread, Utah fits exactly with Colorado, Montana, - it
must have been the Mexicans."
<p>
Well, that's what I thought at first. But we went and did a
careful study of the actual immigration pattern and found, to
our surprise, that Utah didn't have then, and doesn't have
now, a really substantial Mexican-American population. So it
had to be something else.
<p>
Come on folks, if it had to be something else, what do you
think it might have been? Are you thinking what I was
thinking - that it must have had something to do with the
single thing which makes Utah unique in American history
- its association with the  Mormon church.
<p>
With help from some people in Salt Lake City, associated with
the Mormon Church and the Mormon National Tabernacle in
Washington - with their help and a lot of work we found out
what the genesis was of the first marijuana law in this
country.  Yes, it was directly connected to the history of
Utah and Mormonism and it went like this.
<p>
I think that a lot of you know that, in its earliest days, the
Mormon church permitted its male members to have more than one
wife - polygamy.  Do you all know that in 1876, in a case
called Reynolds against the United States, the United States
Supreme Court said that Mormons were free to believe what
they wanted, but they were not free to practice polygamy in
this country. Well, who do you think enforced that ruling of
the Supreme Court in 1876? At the end of the line, who
enforces all rulings of the Supreme Court?  Answer: the state
and local police.  And who were they in Utah then?  All
Mormons, and so nothing happened for many years.  Those who
wanted to live polygamously continued to do so.
<p>
In 1910, the Mormon Church in synod in Salt Lake City decreed
polygamy to be a religious mistake and it was banned as a
matter of the Mormon religion. Once that happened, there was
a crackdown on people who wanted to live in what they called
"the traditional way."  So, just after 1910, a fairly large
number of Mormons left the state of Utah, and indeed left the
United States altogether and moved into northwest Mexico.
They wrote a lot about what they wanted to accomplish in
Mexico.  They wanted to set up communities where they were
basically going to convert the Indians, the Mexicans, and
what they referred to as "the heathen" in the neighborhood
to Mormonism.   By 1914, they had had very little luck with
the heathen, but our research shows now beyond question that
the heathen had a little luck with them. What happened
apparently - now some of you who may be members of the
church, you know that there are still substantial Mormon
communities in northwest Mexico - was that, by and large
most of the Mormons were not happy there, the religion had
not done well there, they didn't feel comfortable there, they
wanted to go back to Utah where there friends were and after
1914 did.
<p>
And with them, the Indians had given them marijuana.  Now once
you get somebody back in Utah with the marijuana it all
becomes very easy, doesn't it?  You know that the Mormon
Church has always been opposed to the use of euphoriants of
any kind.  So, somebody saw them with the marijuana, and in
August of 1915 the Church, meeting again in synod in Salt
Lake City decreed the use of marijuana contrary to the Mormon
religion and then - and this is how things were in Utah in
those days - in October of 1915, the state legislature met and
enacted every religious prohibition as a criminal law and we
had the first criminal law in this country's history against
the use of marijuana.
<p>
That digression into the early state marijuana laws aside, we
will now get back on the Federal track, the year is 1937 and
we get the national marijuana prohibition - the marijuana Tax
Act.
<p>
Now, first again, does everybody see the date, 1937?  You may
have thought that we have had a national marijuana prohibition
for a very long time. Frankly, we haven't.
<p>
The marijuana prohibition is part and parcel of that era which
is now being rejected rather generally - the New Deal era in
Washington in the late 30s.
<p>
Number two, you know, don't you, that whenever Congress is
going to pass a law, they hold hearings.  And you have seen
these hearings.  The hearings can be extremely voluminous,
they go on and on, they have days and days of hearings.  Well,
may I say, that the hearings on the national marijuana
prohibition were very brief indeed.  The hearings on the
national marijuana prohibition lasted one hour, on each of
two mornings and since the hearings were so brief I can tell
you almost exactly what was said to support the national
marijuana prohibition.
<p>
Now, in doing this one at the FBI Academy, I didn't tell them
this story, but I am going to tell you this story. You want to
know how brief the hearings were on the national marijuana
prohibition?
<p>
When we asked at the Library of Congress for a copy of the
hearings, to the shock of the Library of Congress, none could
be found.  We went "What?"  It took them four months to
finally honor our request because - are you ready for this? -
the hearings were so brief that the volume had slid down inside
the side shelf of the bookcase and was so thin it had slid
right down to the bottom inside the bookshelf. That's how brief
they were.
<p>
Are you ready for this?  They had to break the bookshelf open
because it had slid down inside.  There were three bodies of
testimony at the hearings on the national marijuana
prohibition.
<p>
The first testimony came from Commissioner Harry Anslinger,
the newly named Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of
Narcotics. Now, I think some of you know that in the late 20s
and early 30s in this country there were two Federal police
agencies created, the FBI and the FBN - the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
<p>
In our book, I talk at great length about how different the
history of these two organizations really are.
<p>
But, the two organizations, the FBI and the FBN had some
surface similarities and one of them was that a single
individual headed each of them for a very long time.  In
the case of the FBI, it was J. Edgar Hoover, and in the case
of the FBN it was Harry Anslinger, who was the Commissioner
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930 until 1962.
<p>
Commissioner Anslinger gave the Government testimony and I
will quote him directly.  By the way, he was not working
from a text that he had written. He was working from a text
that had been written for him by a District Attorney in New
Orleans, a guy named Stanley.  Reading directly from Mr.
Stanley's work, Commissioner Anslinger told the Congressmen
at the hearings, and I quote, "marijuana is an addictive drug
which produces in  its users insanity, criminality, and
death."  That was the Government testimony to support the
marijuana prohibition from the Commissioner.
<p>
The next body of testimony - remember all of this took a total
of two hours -- uh ..  You understand what the idea was, don't
you?  The idea was to prohibit the cultivation of hemp in
America.  You all know, because there has been some initiative
here in California that hemp has other uses than its
euphoriant use.  For one, hemp has always been used to make
rope. Number two, the resins of the hemp plant are used as
bases for paints and varnishes. And, finally, the seeds of the
hemp plant are widely used in bird seed. Since these
industries were going to be affected the next body of
testimony came from the industrial spokesmen who represented
these industries. The first person was the rope guy.  The
rope guy told a fascinating story - it really is fascinating
- the growth of a hemp to make rope was a principle cash crop
right where I am from, Northern Virginia and Southern Maryland
at the time of the Revolutionary War. But, said the rope guy,
by about 1820 it got cheaper to import the hemp we needed to
make rope from the Far East and so now in 1937 we don't grow
any more hemp to make rope in this country - it isn't needed
anymore.
<p>
If you heard that story, there are two things about it that I
found fascinating.  Number one, it explains the long-standing
rumor that our forefathers had something to do with marijuana.
Yes, they did - they grew it.  Hemp was the principal crop at
Mount Vernon.  It was a secondary crop at Monticello.  Now, of
course, in our research we did not find any evidence that any
of our forefathers had used the hemp plant for euphoriant
purposes, but they did grow it.
<p>
The second part of that story that, to me is even more
interesting is - did you see the date again - 1937?  What did
the rope guy say?  We can get all the hemp we need to make
rope from the Far East, we don't grow it hear anymore because
we don't need to.
<p>
Five years later, 1942, we are cut off from our sources of
hemp in the Far East.  We need a lot of hemp to outfit our
ships for World War II, rope for the ships, and therefore,
the Federal Government, as some of you know, went into the
business of growing hemp on gigantic farms throughout the
Midwest and the South to make rope to outfit the ships for
World War II.
<p>
So, even to this day, if you are from the Midwest you will
always meet the people who say, "Gosh, hemp grows all along
the railroad tracks."  Well, it does.  Why?  Because these
huge farms existed all during World War II.
<p>
But, the rope people didn't care.  The paint and varnish
people said "We can use something else." And, of the
industrial spokesmen, only the birdseed people balked.  The
birdseed people were the ones who balked and the birdseed
person was asked, "Couldn't you use some other seed?"
<p>
These are all, by the way, direct quotes from the hearings.
The answer the birdseed guy gave was, "No, Congressman, we
couldn't.  We have never found another seed that makes a birds
coat so lustrous or makes them sing so much."
<p>
So, on the ground that the birdseed people needed it - did you
know that the birdseed people both got and kept an exemption
from the marijuana Tax Act right through this very day for
so-called "denatured seeds"?
<p>
In any event, there was Anslinger's testimony, there was the
industrial testimony - there was only one body of testimony
left at these brief hearings and it was medical.  There were
two pieces of medical evidence introduced with regard to the
marijuana prohibition.
<p>
The first came from a pharmacologist at Temple University who
claimed that he had injected the active ingredient in
marijuana into the brains of 300 dogs, and two of those dogs
had died.  When asked by the Congressmen, and I quote,
"Doctor, did you choose dogs for the similarity of their
reactions to that of humans?"  The answer of the
pharmacologist was, "I wouldn't know, I am not a dog psychologist."
<p>
Well, the active ingredient in marijuana was first synthesized
in a laboratory in Holland after World War II.  So what it was
this pharmacologist injected into these dogs we will never
know, but it almost certainly was not the active ingredient in
marijuana.
<p>
The other piece of medical testimony came from a man named Dr.
William C. Woodward.  Dr. Woodward was both a lawyer and a
doctor and he was Chief Counsel to the American Medical
Association.  Dr. Woodward came to testify at the behest of
the American Medical Association saying, and I quote, "The
American Medical Association knows of no evidence that
marijuana is a dangerous drug."
<p>
What's amazing is not whether that's true or not.  What's
amazing is what the Congressmen then said to him.
Immediately upon his saying, and I quote again, "The American
Medical Association knows of no evidence that marijuana is a
dangerous drug.," one of the Congressmen said, "Doctor, if you
can't say something good about what we are trying to do, why
don't you go home?"
<p>
That's an exact quote.  The next Congressman said, "Doctor, if
you haven't got something better to say than that, we are sick
of hearing you." Now, the interesting question for us is not
about the medical evidence.  The most fascinating question is:
why was this legal counsel to the most prestigious group of
doctors in the United States treated in such a high-handed
way? And the answer makes a principle thesis of my work - and
that is - you've seen it, you've been living it the last ten
years.  The history of drugs in this country perfectly mirrors
the history of this country.
<p>
So look at the date - 1937 - what's going on in this country?
Well, a lot of things, but the number one thing was that, in
1936, President Franklin Roosevelt was reelected in the
largest landslide election in this country's history till
then. He brought with him two Democrats for every Republican,
all, or almost all of them pledged to that package of economic
and social reform legislation we today call the New Deal.
<p>
And, did you know that the American Medical Association, from
1932, straight through 1937, had systematically opposed every
single piece of New Deal legislation. So that, by 1937, this
committee, heavily made up of New Deal Democrats is simply
sick of hearing them: "Doctor, if you can't say something good
about what we are trying to do, why don't you go home?"
<p>
So, over the objection of the American Medical Association,
the bill passed out of committee and on to the floor of
Congress.  Now, some of you may think that the debate on the
floor of Congress was more extensive on the marijuana
prohibition. It wasn't. It lasted one minute and thirty-two
seconds by my count and, as such, I will give it to you
verbatim.
<p>
The entire debate on the national marijuana  prohibition was
as follows - and, by the  way, if you had grown up in
Washington, DC as I had you would appreciate this date.  Are
you ready?  The bill was brought on to the floor of the House
of Representatives - there never was any Senate debate on it
not one word - 5:45 Friday afternoon, August 20.  Now, in
pre-air-conditioning Washington, who was on the floor of the
House?  Who was on the floor of the House? Not very many people.
<p>
Speaker Sam Rayburn called for the bill to be passed on
"tellers."  Does everyone know "tellers"?  Did you know that
for the vast bulk of legislation in this country, there is not
a recorded vote.  It is simply, more people walk past this
point than walk past that point and it passes - it's called
"tellers."  They were getting ready to pass this thing on
tellers without discussion and without a recorded vote when
one of the few Republicans left in Congress, a guy from
upstate New York, stood up and asked two questions, which
constituted the entire debate on the national marijuana
prohibition. "Mr. Speaker, what is this bill about?"
<p>
To which Speaker Rayburn replied, "I don't know. It has
something to do with a thing called marijuana.  I think it's a
narcotic of some kind."
<p>
Undaunted, the guy from Upstate New York asked a second
question, which was as important to the Republicans as it was
unimportant to the Democrats. "Mr. Speaker, does the American
Medical Association support this bill?" In one of the most
remarkable things I have ever found in any research, a guy who
was on the committee, and who later went on to become a Supreme
Court Justice, stood up and - do you remember? The AMA guy was
named William C. Woodward - a member of the committee who had
supported the bill leaped to his feet and he said, "Their
Doctor Wentworth came down here. They support this bill 100
percent."  It wasn't true, but it was good enough for the
Republicans. They sat down and the bill passed on tellers,
without a recorded vote.
<p>
In the Senate there never was any debate or a recorded vote,
and the bill went to President Roosevelt's desk and he signed
it and we had the national marijuana prohibition.
<p>
Now, the next step in our story is the period from 1938 to
1951. I have three stories to tell you about 1938 to 1951.
<p>
The first of them.  Immediately after the passage of the
national marijuana prohibition, Commissioner Anslinger
decided to hold a conference of all the people who knew
something about marijuana - a big national conference.  He
invited forty-two people to this conference.  As part our
research for the book, we found the exact transcript of this
conference.  Ready?
<p>
The first morning of the conference of the forty-two people
that Commissioner Anslinger invited to talk about marijuana,
39 of them got up and said some version of "Gee, Commissioner
Anslinger, I don't know why you asked me to this conference,
I don't know anything about marijuana." That left three people.
Dr. Woodward and his assistant - you know what they thought.
<p>
That left one person - the pharmacologist from Temple
University - the guy with the dogs.
<p>
And what do you think happened as a result of that
conference?  Commissioner Anslinger named the pharmacologist
from Temple University the Official Expert of the Federal
Bureau of Narcotics about marijuana, a position the guy held
until 1962.  Now, the irony of trying to find out what the
drug did after it had been prohibited - finding out that only
one person agrees with you - and naming him the Official
Expert, speaks for itself.
<p>
The next story from this time period was a particular favorite
of the police groups to whom I spoke at the FBI Academy,
because it is a law enforcement story.
<p>
After national marijuana prohibition was passed, Commissioner
Anslinger found out, or got reports, that certain people were
violating the national marijuana prohibition and using
marijuana and, unfortunately for them, they fell into an
identifiable occupational group.  Who were flouting the
marijuana prohibition?  Jazz musicians.  And so, in 1947,
Commissioner Anslinger sent out a letter, I quote it
verbatim, "Dear Agent So-and-so, Please prepare all cases in
your jurisdiction involving musicians in violation of the
marijuana laws. We will have a great national round-up arrest
of all such persons on a single day.  I will let you know what
day."
<p>
That letter went out on, I think, October 24, 1947.  The
responses by the resident agents were all in the file.  My
favorite - at the bottom line, there wasn't a single resident
agent who didn't have reservations about this idea - came from
the Hollywood agent.  This is the exact letter of the FBN
agent in charge in Hollywood.
<p>
"Dear Commissioner Anslinger,
I have your letter of October 24.  Please be advised that the
musical community here in Hollywood are unionized and very
tight we have been unable to get an informant inside it.
So, at the present time, we have no cases involving musicians
in violation of the marijuana laws."
<p>
For the next year and a half, Commissioner Anslinger got those
kinds of letters.  He  never acknowledged any of the problems
that the agents said they were having with this idea and always
wrote them back the same letter.
<p>
"Dear Agent so-and-so,
Glad to hear you are working hard to give effect to my
directive of October 24, 1947.  We will (and he always
underlined the word 'will') have a great national round-up
arrest of musicians in violation of the marijuana laws all
on a single day.  Don't worry, I will let you know what day."
<p>
This went on - and, of course, you know that some jazz
musicians were, in fact, arrested in the late 40's - this all
went on until it ended just the way it began - with something
that Anslinger said.   I don't see anybody in here really old
enough to appreciate this point, but Commissioner Anslinger
was testifying before a Senate Committee in 1948.  He was
saying, "I need more agents."  And, of course, the Senators
asked him why.
<p>
"Because there are people out there violating the marijuana
laws." Well, you know what the Senators asked - "Who?"
<p>
And in a moment that every Government employee should avoid
like the plague, Anslinger first said, "Musicians."  But then
he looked up at that Senate committee and he gave them a
little piece of his heart and said the single line which
provoked the most response in this country's history about the
non-medical use of drugs. Anslinger said, "And I don't mean
good musicians, I mean jazz musicians."
<p>
Friends, there is no way to tell you what a torrent ensued.
Within 24 hours, 76 newspaper editorials slammed him,
including special editions the then booming trade press of the
jazz music industry.  With three days, the Department of the
Treasury had received fifteen thousand letters.  bunches
of them were still in bags when I got there - never been
opened at all. I opened a few. Here was a typical one, and it
was darling.
<p>
"Dear Commissioner Anslinger,
<p>
   I applaud your efforts to rid America of the scourge of
narcotics addiction.  If you are as ill-informed about that
as you are about music, however, you will never succeed."
<p>
One of the things that we had access to that really was fun
was the Commissioner's own appointment book for all of his
years. And, five days after he says "I don't mean good
musicians, I mean jazz musicians," there is a notation: 10 AM
- appointment with the Secretary of the Treasury."  Well, I
don't know what happened at that appointment, but from that
appointment on, no mention is ever made again of the great
national round-up arrest of musicians in violation of the
marijuana laws all on a single day, much to the delight of
the agents who never had any heart for it in the first place.
<p>
The final story from this period is my favorite story from
this period, by far, and, again, there is simply nobody here
who is really old enough to appreciate this story.   You know,
if you talk to your parents - that's the generation we really
need to talk to - people who were adults during the late 30's
and 40's.  And you talk to them about marijuana in particular
you would be amazed at the amazing reputation that marijuana
has among the generation ahead of you as to what it does to
its users.
<p>
In the late 30's and early 40's marijuana was routinely
referred to as "the killer drug," "the assassin of youth."
You all know "reefer madness," right?  Where did these
extraordinary stories that circulated in this country about
what marijuana would do to its users come from?
<p>
The conventional wisdom is that Anslinger put them over on
Americans in his effort to compete with Hoover for
empire-building, etc.  I have to say, in some fairness, that
one of the things that our research did, in some sense, was
to rehabilitate Commissioner Anslinger. Yes, there was some
of that but, basically, it wasn't just that Anslinger was
trying to dupe people.
<p>
The terrific reputation that marijuana got in the late '30s
and early '40s stemmed from something Anslinger had said.
Does everybody remember what Anslinger said about the drug?
"Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users
insanity, criminality, and death."
<p>
Well, this time the magic word - come along lawyers out there,
where's the magic word?  -  Insanity. Marijuana use, said the
government, would produce insanity.
<p>
And, sure enough, in the late '30s and early '40s, in five
really flamboyant murder trials, the defendant's sole defense
was that he - or, in the most famous of them, she - was not
guilty by reason of insanity for having used marijuana prior
to the commission of the crime.
<p>
All right, it's time to take you guys back to class here.  If
you are going to put on an insanity defense, what do you need?
You need two things, don't you?  Number one, you need an
Expert Witness.
<p>
Where, oh where, in this story, are we going to find an expert
witness? Here it comes - sure enough - the guy from Temple
University - the guy with the dogs. I promise you, you are not
going to believe this.
<p>
In the most famous of these trials, what happened was two
women jumped on a Newark, New Jersey bus and shot and killed
and robbed the bus driver. They put on the marijuana insanity
defense.  The defense called the pharmacologist, and of
course, you know how to do this now, you put the expert on,
you say "Doctor, did you do all of this experimentation and
so on?"   You qualify your expert.  "Did you write all about
it?"  "Yes, and I did the dogs" and now he is an expert.  Now
you ask him what?   You ask the doctor "What have you done
with the drug?" And he said, and I quote, "I've experimented
with the dogs, I have written something about it and" - are
you ready - "I have used the drug myself."
<p>
What do you ask him next?  "Doctor, when you used the drug,
what happened?" With all the press present at this flamboyant
murder trial in Newark New Jersey, in 1938, the pharmacologist
said, and I quote, in response to the question "When you used
the drug, what happened?," his exact response was:
"After two puffs on a marijuana cigarette, I was turned into a
bat."
<p>
He wasn't done yet.  He testified that he flew around the
room for fifteen minutes and then found himself at the bottom
of a two-hundred-foot high ink well Well, friends, that sells
a lot of papers. What do you think the Newark Star Ledger
headlines the next day, October 12, 1938?  "Killer Drug Turns
Doctor to Bat!"
<p>
What else do we need to put on an insanity defense?  We need
the defendant's testimony - himself or herself.  OK, you put
defendant on the stand, what do you ask?  "What happened on
the night of  .  ."
<p>
"Oh, I used marijuana."
<p>
"And then what happened?"
<p>
And, if the defendant wants to get off, what is he or she
going to say?  "It made me crazy."
<p>
You know what the women testified?  In Newark they testified,
and I quote, "After two puffs on a marijuana cigarette my
incisor teeth grew six inches long and dripped with blood."
<p>
This was the craziest business you ever saw.  Every one of
these so-called marijuana insanity defenses were successful.
<p>
The one in New York was just outlandish.  Two police officers
were shot and killed in cold blood.  The defendant puts on the
marijuana insanity defense and, in that case, there was never
even any testimony that the defendant had even used marijuana.
The testimony in the New York case was that, from the time the
bag of marijuana came into his room it gave off "homicidal
vibrations," so he started killing dogs, cats, and ultimately
two police officers.
<p>
Commissioner Anslinger, sitting in Washington, seeing these
marijuana insanity defenses, one after another successful,
he writes to the pharmacologist from Temple University and
says, "If you don't stop testifying for the defense in these
matters, we are going to revoke your status as the Official
Expert of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics."  He didn't want
to lose his status, so he stopped testifying, nobody else
would testify that marijuana had turned them into a bat,
and so these insanity defenses were over but not before
marijuana had gotten quite a reputation, indeed.
<p>
The next step - and now we are going to move very quickly
here - in 1951. We get a whole new drug law called the Boggs
Act and it is important to us for only two reasons.
<p>
Number one, it reflects what I am going to call the formula
for drug legislation in this country.  Here is the formula.
The formula really is always the same, think about it in our
lifetime.
<p>
The formula is that someone, and by the way, that someone is
usually the media, perceive an increase in drug use.  What's
the answer?  The answer in the history of this country is
always the same - a new criminal law with harsher penalties
in every single offense category.
<p>
Where did the perception come from this time? Well, if you
have ever seen movies from this time period like High School
Confidential, the perception was that kids in high school
were starting to use drugs.  What's the answer? The answer is
always the same.  The Boggs Act of 1951 quadrupled the
penalties in every single offense category and, by the way,
the Boggs Act had a whole new rationale for the marijuana
prohibition.
<p>
Do you remember the old rationale - that marijuana was an
addictive drug which caused in its users insanity,
criminality, and death?   Just before Anslinger was to testify
on the Boggs Act, the doctor who ran for the Government the
Lexington, Kentucky narcotics rehabilitation clinic testified
ahead of Anslinger and testified that the medical community
knew that marijuana wasn't an addictive drug,.  It doesn't
produce death, or insanity, and instead of producing
criminality, it probably produces passivity, said the doctor.
<p>
Who was the next witness?  Anslinger.  And, if you see, that
the rug had been pulled out from under everything he had said
in the 1937 hearings to support the marijuana prohibition.
In what I call a really slick Federal shuffle - Anslinger, you
know, had been bitten bad enough by what he said, he didn't
want that again - he said, the doctor is right, marijuana - he
always believed, by the way, that there was something in
marijuana which produced criminality - is not an addictive
drug, it doesn't produce insanity or death but it is "the
certain first step on the road to heroin addiction."  And the
notion that marijuana was the stepping stone to heroin became,
in 1951, the sole rationale for the national marijuana
prohibition. It was the first time that marijuana was lumped
with all the other drugs and not treated separately,  and we
multiply the penalties in every offense category.
<p>
By the way,  I told you that the history of drug legislation
reflects the history of the country.  1951, what's going on?
The Korean War, the Cold War.  It didn't take the press a
minute to see this perceived use in drug use among high school
kids our "foreign enemies," using drugs to subvert the
American young.  In our book, we have ten or fifteen great
political cartoons.  My favorite is a guy with a big Fu Man
Chu (mustache) labeled "Oriental Communism."  He has a big
needle marked "Dope" and he has the American kids lying
down - "Free World" it is marked. There it was - that our
foreign enemies were going to use drugs to subvert the
American young. What did we do?  We passed a new law that
increased the penalties in every offense category by a factor
of four.
<p>
Well, now once you buy it, the ball is going to roll like
crazy.  
<p>
1956, we get another new drug law, called the Daniel Act,
named for Senator Price Daniel of Texas.  It is important to
us for only two reasons.  One, it perfectly reflects the
formula again.  What is the formula? Somebody perceives and
increase in drug use in this country and the answer is always
a new criminal law with harsher penalties in every offense
category.
<p>
Where did the perception in 1956 come from that there was an
increase in drug use?  Answer:  Anybody remember 1956?  In
1956, we had the first set ever of televised Senate hearings.
And whose hearings were they?  They were the hearings of
Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee about organized crime in
America. 
<p>
These hearings, which everybody watched on their little sets
showed two things that we all know today, but it sure made
their socks roll up and down then.  Number one, there is
organized crime in America and number two, it makes all its
money selling drugs. There it was, that was all the perception
we needed.  We passed the Daniel Act which  increased the
penalties in every offense category, that had just been
increased times four - times eight. With the passage of each
of these acts, the states passed little Boggs acts, and little
Daniel acts, so that in the period 1958 to 1969, in the
Commonwealth of Virginia, and Virginia was typical, the most
heavily penalized crime in the Commonwealth was possession of
marijuana, or any other drug.
<p>
It led to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years, no
part of which you were eligible for parole or probation, and
as to no part of it were you eligible for a suspended sentence.
<p>
Just to show you where it was, in the same time period first
degree murder in  Virginia had a mandatory minimum sentence
of fifteen years. Rape, a mandatory minimum sentence of ten
years.  Possession of marijuana - not to mention sales of
marijuana with its mandatory minimum of forty years -
mandatory minimum of twenty years.
<p>
That  is the situation in 1969 when we have a new drug law,
the first one in this country's history that does not follow
the formula.  It is the 1969 Dangerous Substances Act.  For he
first time in this country's history, we have a perception of
an increase in drug use during the Sixties, but instead of
raising the penalties, we lower them.  And, further, in the
Dangerous Substances Act of 1969, for the first time we
finally abandon the so-called "taxing" mythology.
<p>
In the 1969 Act, what the Federal law does is, it takes all
the drugs we know - if you can't fill in this next blank, you
are in trouble - except two - which two?  Which two are never
going to be mentioned?  Nicotine and alcohol. But, other than
nicotine and alcohol - every other drug.
<p>
By the way, I tried this with the FBI for twenty years and
they wouldn't listen, and you won't listen either but, I am
going to try.  If you are going to go out and talk about drugs
and whatever you are going to do with drugs, will you please
discard the entirely antiquated and erroneous word
"narcotics."  Narcotics are drugs that put people to sleep.
Almost all of the drugs that we are interested in today don't
do that.
<p>
So, in 1969, the Dangerous Substances Act gave up the effort
to define what are narcotic drugs.  What the 1969 act did, and
what most state laws still do, is to classify all drugs except
nicotine and alcohol by two criteria. What is the drug's
medical use?  And, what is the drug's potential for abuse?
<p>
We put all the drugs, by those two criteria, in schedules, and
then we tie the penalties for possession, possession with
intent  to sell, sale, and sale to a minor to the schedule of
the drug in question.  Now, again, I am no good at this
anymore, I have not kept up with the drug laws, I don't know
who is in what schedule, and many states have abandoned the
schedule but, to give you a flavor of it:  The first schedule,
Schedule One Drugs were drugs that had little or no medical
use and a high potential for abuse. What's going to go in
there?  LSD, marijuana, hashish, they are all in Schedule One
- little or no medical use and a high potential for abuse.
<p>
Then you get some medical use, high potential for abuse - what
do you want there?  Barbiturates, amphetamines,.
<p>
Then we are going to get what?  High medical use and high
potential for abuse. Morphine, codeine.  Codeine is the best
one because codeine is in almost every single prescription
cough medicine and it is addictive as can be. Then you go on
down and get the antibiotics - high medical use, almost no
potential for abuse, and there you are.
<p>
Once you schedule your drugs, you then tie the penalties for
the drugs to the schedule and then, because in 1969 they
wanted to reduce the marijuana penalties they had to deal with
marijuana separately and did so.
<p>
But the 1969 act important for two reasons again:  One, we
abandoned the taxing mythology and; two, it was the first law
in this country's history that, instead of raising the
penalties in every offense category, lowered them. Well, then
you know what happened.  We get the War on Drugs.  You know how
it all went down.  We got perceptions in the 80s that there
was an increase in drug use, a great dramatic decision to
declare war on drugs and, predominantly, war on drug users.
<p>
What I want to say to you is this, and this is where I think
some of you are going to be a little surprised.  You know as
much about that process as I do.  You watched it.  You saw how
we had one law after another, raising the penalties so that as
late as 1990, thirty percent of the minority group population
of the City of Baltimore who are male and between 20 and 29 are
under court supervision for drugs. Thirty percent, that's the
number you are looking for.
<p>
The War on Drugs, a very interesting war, because why?  It was
cheap to fight. It was cheap to fight at first - why?  You
heard me in the "Recent Decisions" talk.  What was last year's
big moment, and the year before?  The change in cheap and easy
forfeiture.  Criminal forfeiture was used to make this a
costless war.  That is, easy forfeiture from those who were
caught allowed us to pay for the war in that way.  I think we
are going to have some real questions about whether people
want to pay for the war on drugs through their taxes because
now the Court has made forfeiture much, much more difficult
in their overall concern for property rights.
<p>
But here is what I think may surprise some of you.  You guys
know as much about the War on Drugs as I do.  I didn't come
hear to talk, or to harangue, or to give you any opinions on
that point.  I think it speaks for itself. It is a failure and
I think it will be judged as a failure.  What I wanted to
bring you instead was, instead of talking about that that
everybody is talking about - and you guys will ultimately
resolve it and you guys are the ones who are seeing all the
drug cases, day in and day out, and always will, until this
changes.  But, what I thought I could bring you was the
part of the story you hadn't heard - how we got to where we
were when the War on Drugs was declared.
<p>
  And one other thing I want to do with you this morning, and
that's this - I want to say one thing.  To tell you the real
truth, my interest isn't in drugs, or in the criminalization
of drugs although I think we should abolish the criminal
penalties for drugs, and deal with it as the Europeans do in a
medical way, but who cares?  That's an opinion.
<p>
What interests me though, isn't drugs.  What interests me is
that larger issue, and the reason that I wrote the piece, and
the reason they were my tenure pieces, I am interested in a
much larger issue, and that is  the idea of Prohibition - the
use of criminal law to criminalize conduct that a large number
of us seem to want to engage in.
<p>
And, for my purposes, - now, Professor Bonnie went on to be
associated with NIDA and with all kinds of drug-related
organizations and continues to be interested in the drug
laws - I am not.  My interest is in criminal prohibitions and,
for my purposes, as a criminal law scholar, we could have
used any prohibition - alcohol prohibition, the prohibition
against gambling that exists still in many states. How about
the prohibition in England from 1840 to 1880 against the
drinking of gin?  Not drinking, just gin - got it?  We could
have used any of these prohibitions.  We didn't. We chose the
marijuana  prohibition because the story had never been told -
and it is an amazing story.
<p>
We could have used any of these prohibitions.  We could have
used the alcohol prohibition.  The reason we didn't is
because so much good stuff has been written about it.  And are
you aware of this?  That every single - you know how
fashionable it is to think that scholars can never agree? -
Don't you believe that - Every single person who has ever
written seriously about the national alcohol prohibition
agrees on why it collapsed.  Why?
<p>
Because it violated that iron law of Prohibitions.  What is
the iron law of Prohibitions?  Prohibitions are always enacted
by US, to govern the conduct of THEM.  Do you have me?  Take
the alcohol prohibition. Every single person who has ever
written about it agrees on why it collapsed.
<p>
Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who
were not themselves, opposed to drinking.  Do you have me?
What?  The right answer to that one is Huh?  Want to hear it
again?
<p>
Large numbers of people supported the idea of prohibition who
were not themselves, opposed to drinking.  Want to see it?
<p>
Let me give you an example, 1919.  You are a Republican in
upstate New York. Whether you drink, or you don't, you are
for the alcohol prohibition because it will close the
licensed saloons in the City of New York which you view to
be the corrupt patronage and power base of the Democratic
Party  in New York.  So almost every Republican in New York
was in favor of national alcohol prohibition.  And, as soon
as it passed, what do you think they said?  "Well, what do
you know?  Success.  Let's have a drink."  That's what they
thought, "let's have a drink."  "Let's drink to this."  A
great success, you see.
<p>
Do you understand me?  Huge numbers of people in this country
were in favor of national alcohol prohibition who were not
themselves opposed to drinking. I just want to go back to the
prohibition against the drinking of gin. How could a country
prohibit just the drinking of gin, not the drinking of
anything else for forty years?  Answer:  The rich people drank
whiskey and the poor people drank what? - gin.  Do you see it?
<p>
Let's try the gambling prohibition.  You know when I came to
Virginia, this was a very lively issue, the gambling
prohibition.  By the way, I think it's a lively issue in
California.  Are you ready for it?
<p>
Have you ever seen the rhetoric that goes around the gambling
prohibition? You know what it is.  Look, we have had a good
time.  We have been together yesterday, we have been together
today, I have known a lot of you guys for ages.  How about
after the talk, we have a minute or two, let's go on up to
your room and we will play a little nickel, dime, quarter
poker.  Want to play some poker this afternoon?  Why not?
It's a nice thing to do.
<p>
Would we be outraged if the California State Police came
barreling through the door and arrested us for violation of
California's prohibition on gambling?  Of course we would.
Because, who is not supposed to gamble?  Oh, you know who
is not supposed to gamble - them poor people, that's who.
My God, they will spend the milk money.  They don't know
how to control it. They can't handle it.  But us?  We know
what we are doing.
<p>
That's it.  Every criminal prohibition has that same touch to
it, doesn't it?  It is enacted by US and it always regulates
the conduct of THEM.  And so, if you understand that is the
name of the game, you don't have to ask me, or any of the
other people which prohibitions will be abolished and which
ones won't  because you will always know.  The iron law of
prohibitions - all of them - is that they are passed by an
identifiable US to control the conduct of an identifiable THEM.
<p>
And a prohibition is absolutely done for when it does what?
Comes back and bothers US.  If, at any time, in any way, that
prohibition comes back and bothers us, we will get rid of it
for sure, every doggone time.  Look at the alcohol prohibition
if you want a quick example.  As long as it is only THEM - you
know, them criminals, them crazy people, them young people,
them minority group members - we are fine.  But any
prohibition that comes back and bothers US is done for.
<p>
Let's just try the marijuana prohibition as a quick one.  Who
do you think was arrested 650,000 strong two years ago for
violation of the marijuana laws?  Do you think it was all
minority group members?  Nope.  It was not. It was some very
identifiable children of US - children of the middle class.
You don't have to answer my opinion.  No prohibition will
stand - ever - when it comes back and penalizes our children -
the children of US who enacted it.  And in fact, do you have
any real doubt about that?  Do you know what a fabulous
sociological study we will be if we become the first society
in the history of the world to penalize the sons and daughters
of the wealthy class?  Unheard of.
<p>
And so, yeah, we will continue the War on Drugs for a while
until everybody sees its patent bankruptcy.  But, let me say
that I am not confident that good sense will prevail.  Why?
Because we love this idea of prohibition. We really do.  We
love it in this country.  And so I will tell you what I
predict.  You will always know which ones are going out and
which ones are coming in.  And, can't you see the one coming
right over the hill?  Well, folks, we are going to have a new
prohibition because we love this idea that we can solve
difficult medical, economic, and social problems by the simple
enactment of a criminal law.  We adore this, and of course,
you judges work it out, we have solved our problem.  Do you
have it?  Our problem is over with the enactment of the law.
You and the cops work it out, but we have solved our problem.
<p>
Here comes the new one?  What's it going to be?  No, it won't
be guns, this one starts easy.  This one is the Surgeon
General has what? - Determined - not "we want a little more
checking it out," not "we need a few more studies,"  not
"reasonable people disagree" - "The Surgeon General has
determined that the smoking of cigarettes will kill you."
<p>
Now,  all you need, and here is my formula, for a new
prohibition every time is what?  We need an intractable,
difficult, social, economic, or medical problem.  But that is
not enough.  There has to be another thing.  It has to divide
by class - by social or economic class, between US and THEM.
And so, here it comes.
<p>
You know the Federal Government has been spending a lot of
money since 1968 trying to persuade us not to smoke. And,
indeed, the absolute numbers on smoking have declined very
little.  But, you know who has quit smoking, don't you?  In
gigantic numbers?  The college-educated, that's who.  The
college-educated, that's who doesn't smoke.  Who are they?
Tomorrow's what? Movers and kickers, that's who.
Tomorrow's movers and kickers don't smoke. Who does smoke?
Oh, you know who smokes out of all proportion to their numbers
in the society - it is the people standing in your criminal
courtrooms, that's who.  Who are they? Tomorrow's moved and
kicked, that's who.
<p>
And, there it is friends, once it divides between the movers
and kickers and the moved and kicked it is all over and it
will be all over very shortly.
<p>
It starts with "You know, they shouldn't smoke, they are
killing themselves."  Then it turns, as it has - you see the
ads out here - "They shouldn't smoke, they are killing us."
And pretty soon, that class division will happen, we will have
the legislatures full of tomorrow's movers and kickers and
they are going to say just what they are going to say any time
now.  "You know, this has just gotta stop, and we got an
answer for it."  We are going to have a criminal statute that
forbids the manufacture, sale, or possession of tobacco
cigarettes, or tobacco products period.
<p>
You know that the cigarette companies are expecting it.  What
have they been doing?  They have been shifting all of their
operations out of the United States and diversifying like crazy.
Where are they going to sell their cigarettes?  In China,
that's where.  And they are already moving, because they see
it and I see it.
<p>
Ready?  What are we going to have?  You know what we are going
to have.  One day - when's it gonna happen, ten years,
fifteen?  - some legislator will get up and, just as though it
had never been said before, "You know we gotta solve this
smoking problem and I got a solution - a criminal prohibition
against the manufacture, sale, or possession of tobacco
cigarettes."  And then you know what happens.  Then everybody
who did want a cigarette here today, if there is anyone here
who smokes, you are going to have to hide in the bathroom.
And cigarettes are no longer going to be three dollars a
pack, they are going to be three dollars a piece.  And who's
going to sell them to you?  Who will always sell them to you?
The people who will sell you anything - organized crime.
You got the concept, we will go through the whole darn thing
again because I am telling you this country is hooked on the
notion of prohibition.
<p>
Let me conclude, and again this is my prediction  - I will
tell you I don't think it is subject to opinion.  Just look at
it.  Just take a look at what has happened now and what will
happen.  I will tell you how inexorable it is. If we get
together here in the year 2005, I will bet you that it is as
likely as not that the possession of marijuana may not be
criminal in this state.  But the manufacture, sale, and
possession of tobacco will be, and why?  Because we love this
idea of prohibitions, we can't live without them. They are our
very favorite thing because we know how to solve difficult,
social, economic, and medical problems - a new criminal law
with harsher penalties in every category for everybody.

Here are some excerpts of a Surgeon General's report.  The pages were
scanned and Optical Character Recognition was used to extract the
text.  I put the tables in HTML form.  Any errors were probably
introduced by me.

<hr>

Public Health Service. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
Smoking and health: report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon
General of the Public Health Service. Washington, DC: US Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare, Public Health Service, 1964; DHHS
publication no.(PHS)64-1103.

<hr>

...  For fixed amount of smoking, the mortality ratios (with one exception)
exhibit consistent and rather striking increase as the age at which
smoking was started decreases.  This increase appear in all smoking
groups of Table 8.  For men who started smoking cigarettes under the
age of 20, the over-all death rate was about twice that for
non-smokers, whereas for theme who did not start until they were over
25 the death rate was only about 35 percent higher.
<p>
MORTALITY RATIO BY DURATION OF SMOKING 
<p> 
Three studies have some data available on the number of years during
which the subjects had smoked.  The comparison of mortality ratios for
different lengths of time smoked is of interest in relation to two
questions raised by Dorn (6) in an earlier analysis of the U.S.
veterans' data.  Is there a minimum period of use during which no
effect on the death rate is noticeable?  Is there a maximum period
after which no increase in the relative death rate is perceptible?
For current cigarette smokers the results (Table 9) are not clear-cut.
In the U.S. veterans study, men smoking for less than 15 years had
death rates about the same as non-smokers. There is a rise of about 50
percent in the mortality ratio for those who had smoked 15-35 years,
with a further rise for those smoking longer than 35 years.  The study
of men in nine states shows a rise from under 25 years to 25-34 years
duration, but no further rise thereafter.  In the Canadian study the
mortality ratio with cigarette smokers is just as high for durations
less than 15 years as for durations of 15-29 years, though there is a
rise (to 1.73) for smokers of cigarettes only who have been smoking
more than 30 years.

Thus, all three studies show some increase in the mortality ratios
with longer duration of smoking, but the pattern is irregular.  In a
further breakdown of the data by amount smoked, Hammond and Horn (10)
found no trend with duration for men smoking more than a pack a day,
but the other two studies show an upward trend for this group of
smokers For cigar smokers the only groups showing an increase in death
rates over non-smokers are those smoking for the longest period (Table
9).  The increases of 12 percent for the 35 years or over group in the
U.S. study and of 31 percent for the 30 years or over group in the
Canadian study are both statistically significant.
<p>
For pipe smokers no trend with duration of smoking is discernible.
The two figures which stand out (1.34 in the U.S. study and 1.36 in
the Canadian study) are both based on relatively small numbers of
death.
<p>
INHALATION OF SMOKE 
<p>
In two of the studies the subjects were questioned as to whether they
inhaled.  In the study of men in 25 states each subject was asked to
place himself in one of the four classes: do not inhale, inhale
slightly, inhale moderately, inhale deeply. In the Canadian veterans
study the subject simply classified himself as an inhaler or
non-inhaler.
<p>
For current smokers of cigarettes only in the U.S. study, 6 percent of
the subjects stated that they did not inhale, 14 percent inhaled
slightly, 56 percent moderately and 24 percent deeply.  In the
Canadian study 11 percent classified themselves as non-inhalers. 
<p>
Since inhalation practices may vary with the amount smoked, the
results for cigarette smokers (Table 10) are given separately for
different amounts.  For the men in 25 states an increase in the degree
of inhaling for a fixed amount of smoking is in general accompanied by
an increase in the mortality ratio.  The relation of inhalation to
mortality appears quite marked: for instance, non-inhalers who smoke
20-39 cigarettes daily have mortality ratios no higher than moderate
or deep inhalers who smoke 1-9 cigarettes daily.  With the very heavy
smokers (40+ ) the Figures in Table 10 suggest that the mortality
ratio may remain the same for non-, slight, and moderate inhalers  The
ratios of 2.05 (non-) and 1.97 (slight) are, however, based on only 26
and 41 deaths, respectively.

<p>
Looking along the rows of the U.S. veterans study it will be seem that
for each degree of inhalation the mortality ratio increased with the
amount smoked.  Ipsen and Pfaelser (14) have shown that the logarithms
of the 16 death rates at age 61 (approximately the average age) can be
adequately...  
<p>
Ex-Cigar and Pipe Smokers
<p>
Mortality ratios for smokers of cigars only and pipes only who had 
stopped smoking prior to the date of entry are given in Table 14, 
the corresponding ratios for current smokers being included for 
comparison.  
<p>
For ex-cigar smokers the mortality ratios are higher than those for
non-smokers and higher than those for current smokers in all four
studies presented.  The same is true for ex-pipe smokers with the
exception of the Canadian study.
<p>
The interpretation of this result is not clear to us.  According to
Hammond and Horn (10) and Dorn (6), the explanation may be that a
substantial number of cigar and pipe smokers give up because they
become ill:  some date from cigarette smokers that support this
explanation have recently been analyzed by Hammon (12).  Further
analysis of the U.S. veterans data indicates that mortality ratios
run highest in ex-smokers who smoked heavily and for a long time.

EVALUATION OF SOURCES OF DATA 
<p>
The Study Populations 
<p>
Various reasons dictated the particular choices made of the seven
study populations, considerations of feasibility playing an important
role. None of the populations was designed, in particular, to be
representative of the U.S. male population. Any answer to the question
"to what general populations of men can the results be applied?",
must involve an element of unverifiable judgment. However, three of
the studies have populations with widespread geographic distribution
within the United States, as do the British and Canadian studies
within their respective countries. Taken as a whole, the seven
populations offer a substantial breadth of sampling of the type of men
and environmental exposures to be found in North America and Britain,
as well as providing some variation in methodological approach,
although the basic plan was similar in all studies. 
<p>
The seven studies differ considerably in size. They vary also in the
extent to which they are free from methodological weakness. The
studies of men in nine states and men in 25 States, for instance,
suffer from the difficulties that the populations studied are hard to
define, that the smokers and non-smokers were recruited by a large
number of volunteer workers, and that completeness in the reporting of
deaths was bard to achieve, since this depends on report from the
volunteers. On the other hand these studies have the advantage of
being large and of having a broad geographic representation of the
U.S. male population, while the second study is the only one that
attempts to investigate many other relevant variables in which smokers
and non-smokers may differ. In the California occupational study the
focus of interest is occupational differences in lung cancer
mortality, smoking history being recorded primarily in order to be
able to adjust comparisons among different occupational groups for
differences in amount smoked. In the analysis we have not attempted to
rate the studies as to over-all quality or to assign differential
weights to their results, except that in the smaller studies it is
recognized that mortality ratios ere subject to larger sampling
errors. Our attitude is to attach importance only to results that
appear to be generally confirmed by the studies. 
<p>
Some idea of the relative death rates in these studies as compared
with the 1960 white male population of the United States is given in
Table 15, which shows the age-adjusted death rates for ages 35 and
over, using the age distribution of the U.S. white male population
as a standard. (The choice of 1960 for the comparison is arbitrary,
but the white male rate changed little between 1955 and 1960.) 
<p>
In all studies the death rates for non-smokers are markedly below
those of U.S. white males in 1960. Even the smokers of one pack of
cigarettes or more daily have death rates that average slightly below
the U.S. white male figure. To some extent this is to be expected,
since hospitalized and other seriously ill persons are not recruited
in such studies. The sizes of the differences appear, however,
surprising for the studies with United States population. Hammond
and Horn (10), in a special investigation on this question,
concluded that the discrepancy in their study was due to the screening
out of sick persons in recruiting plus probably a selection toward
men of higher economic levels. They point out that their death rates
are substantially above those for males who had held ordinary life
insurance policies for from...

From a brochure entitled "Why buy Meerschaum" - C.A.O Meerschaums - 1985
                                                1-800-BEST CAO (?still valid?)
<h3><center>WHY BUY MEERSCHAUM?</center></h3>

Simply put, because it affords a unique smoking experience. Meerschaum is
the most flavorful and beautiful pipe you can own. Meerschaum - one on the
most porous substances found in nature - acts as a filter,  absorbs tobacco
tars and nicotine, and yields a most satisfying smoke. Meerschaum smokes
cool and dry with a flavor unrivaled by another pipe. As it ages,
meerschaum colors a rich honey-brown, improving both in appearance and
taste.
<p>
Meerschaum Pipes - with a minimum of proper care - will last for a
lifetime. They will not burn out as briars do.
<p>
A CAO meerschaum is an investment in smoking pleasure
<p>
<h3><center>ENJOY THE ARISTOCRAT OF PIPES.</center></h3>
<p>
As beautiful as meerschaum is to the eye, its true beauty must be
experienced.
<p>
A meerschaum is made to smoke.
<p>
Hold it. Enjoy its light weight and silky feel, its distinctive taste, its
ripening to a mellow golden-brown.
<p>
Justly deserving its reputation as the "aristocrat" of pipes, the
meerschaum is not meant for the connoisseur alone. All pipe smokers can
appreciate the unique pleasure of meerschaum.

<h3><center>MEERSCHAUM - A GIFT FROM THE SEA.</center></h3>

"Meerschaum" is a German word meaning literally, "sea-foam," alluding to
the belief that it was the compressed whitecaps of waves. Meerschaum is a
mineral - hydrous silicate of magnesium - of organic origin. Composed of
the fossilized shells of tiny sea creatures that fell to the ocean floor
millions of years ago, meerschaum is found in red clay deposits. The
average size of the meerschaum blocks extracted from the clay is about the
size of a grapefruit.

<h3><center>THE JEWEL OF ESKISHEHIR</center></h3>

Meerschaum deposits of the highest quality are found only in one place in
the world - in the small city of Eskishehir in central turkey. And here the
deposits are confined to an are of only 4 square miles. 
<p>
Mined with hand tools, and by men trained in this singular family
tradition, meerschaum is excavated at depths ranging from 200 to 300 feet.
The miners wash the raw meerschaum lumps and sort them into 5 categories
according to quality. Each of these 5 categories is further divided into 12
qualities according to size, color porosity and homogeneity of the
mineral." 
<p>
"The BLOCK-MEERSCHAUM - not to be confused with pressed meerschaum - is
shipped to the manufacturer. And only the purest 10% of this block
meerschaum is judged suitable for CAO pipes.

<h3><center>CRAFTING THE WORLD'S FINEST PIPES</center></h3>

Nearly 300 years ago, the first meerschaum pipe was carved by hand. And
today, these unique pipes are still carved by hand.
<p>
The carver, a craftsman of unique ability and long experience, examines
each piece of meerschaum, calculating the lines of cleavage along which it
should be split.The split block-meerschaum is soaked in water for 15-30
minutes until the material achieves a cheese-like consistency. 
<p>
Working with the softened material, the carver determines the rough shape
of the pipe before the bowl and draft hole are bored. Like all fine
hand-crafted articles, no two meerschaums are alike.
<p>
The carved meerschaum goes into a kiln at high temperature, a process that
removes all moisture from the mineral. The shank is threaded and fitted
with a stem.
<p>
After meticulous polishing with the finest grade abrasives, the meerschaum
is ready for waxing. Though there are many different wax formulas, beeswax
alone yields the rich coloring associated with the finest Meerschaums.
Melted and then bleached, the beeswax is ready to receive the pipe itself.
The subtle differences in color and tone among CAO pipes are intentional,
achieve ed by careful dipping of the pipes a specific number of times.
<p>
Finally, the slightest imperfection detected in the finished pipe means
that it cannot wear the CAO name. The quality of each CAO meerschaum is
thus insured.

<h3><center>SOME DO'S AND DON'TS FOR CAO MEERSCHAUM SMOKERS.</center></h3>

DON'T be afraid to handle or hold your meerschaum with clean hands.
Remember, you purchased a meerschaum primarily for your smoking pleasure.
The "Added" pleasure you derive from a meerschaum is watching it color as
you smoke it. 
<p>
The conventional wisdom on this topic is that handling a meerschaum while
warm removes the beeswax coating on the pipe, which highlights its
coloring. While this is true, only the purist - the smoker far more
concerned with the look of his pipe than his own smoking pleasure - need
worry about it. Besides, you can replace the wax coating removed by
handling very simply with CAO's Meerschaum Antiquing Compound.
<p>
DO take care when removing the stem of your CAO meerschaum by pulling it
and twisting it CLOCKWISE while supporting the shank with the fingers.
Replace the stem by pushing it and twisting it CLOCKWISE also. A little
care here will be repaid through a lifetime of smoking pleasure.
<p>
DON'T tap your CAO meerschaum against a hard surface. If you tap it in your
palm, be sure to support the shank firmly with your hand. This is sound
advice for briar pipe smokers also.
<p>
DON'T worry about "breaking in" your CAO meerschaum. Meerschaum pipes,
unlike briars, do not burn and hence need not be protected by a carbon
"cake" inside the bowl.
<p>
DO clean the cake or reside inside the bowl of you meerschaum. Use a
sharp-edged, blunt-ended tool. Avoid digging into the heel of the pipe when
cleaning the graft hole by not allowing the pipe cleaner to extend too far
into the bowl. [The meerschaum is WET and SOFT in the heel immediately
after a smoke. - whm.]
<p>
Smoke your favorite blend in your CAO meerschaum. Each pipe will color
differently. However this process depend on how often you smoke, not on
what tobacco you smoke.
<p>
Your CAO meerschaum dealer will be pleased to answer any further questions
you may have about our pipes. Be suer to ask about CAO's complete line of
meerschaum accessories.
<p>
Remember also who smokes CAO meerschaums: presidents, statesmen, doctors
and businessmen - people in all professions, all lines of work - and you.

From: Elliott Evans 
Subject: Zippo lighters

Now, I don't mean to resurrect the debate about whether or
not zippos are good for lighting your smoke; most of us have
heard both sides of the debate (Works great! Tastes funny!)
and have already made our decisions.

I was in my local tobacconist perusing the 1996 Zippo catalog,
and happened to flip to the pages where they describe the
process of ordering your own *custom imprinted* lighters.
Various methods of etching, engraving, and enameling exist,
and the minimum order for any design is just fifty lighters.

So I had the idea that maybe some members of the list would
be interested in going in together on such an order. I don't
yet know how much each lighter would cost, or what the design
would be, but if there's enough interest, I could look into it.

My first idea for a design is based on the signature file of
the digest, and would be printed in bright green on a black
lighter to give that "computer monitor" feeling.

	 )            )
	(  Internet  (
	 ) Pipes      )
	(  Mailgroup (
	 )            )
	 U/~ (_{@}___||

For those of you who are thinking "here's somebody trying to make a
quick buck," I would be offering the lighters on a cost recovery basis,
charging only enough to cover the imprinting fees, lighters, shipping,
and suchlike. My figures would be public and easily checkable.

With the thousands of people on this list maybe fifty will be
interested.  If you're interested, please send *me* (not the list) a
note saying so at "eeyore+@cmu.edu".

<h2><a name="1.">1. The Alt.Smokers.Pipe FAQ.</a></h2>

<h3><a name="1.1">1.1  Introduction.</a></h3>
     This is the Alt.Smokers.Pipe Frequently Asked Questions
Document. It is intended to provide some general guidelines
to the group and some general guidelines to the Fine Art of
Pipe Smoking. Please do keep in mind that pipe smoking is
indeed an art and not a science. So the suggestions here are
just that, your mileage may vary.

     Maintainers Note: The information herein is either the
collective wisdom of the group, or the contributions of some
key individuals. I can only take credit for transcribing the
wisdom!

     Where possible attributions have been duly noted. The
FAQ Maintainer will keep editing down to a minimum and only
to either a) trim inclusions down for brevity or b) correct
typos or make clarifications.


<h3><a name="1.2">1.2  Posting guidelines</a></h3>
     You are welcome to post on Alt.Smokers.Pipe. We
strongly recommend that you read the News.*, or at least
scan them briefly, for generally accepted "Netiquette"
guidelines. (the do's and don'ts of posting on the 'net in
general.) Beyond that, anything related to pipe smoking is
welcome. That includes, but is not limited to, discussions
on merits of  pipes and pipe manufacturers, tobaccos and
tobacco manufacturers and tobacco suppliers, pipe related
esoterica, pipe related paraphernalia etc.

     In view of the last,. we would ask that posts be
limited only to  TOBACCO (legal) smoking. Other smoking
substances gave their own groups and venues and we would
encourage you to go there for discussion of these.

     Commercial advertising is strongly discouraged on the
'net in general and in this group specifically. However,
posts of an informative nature do not fall in this category.
For example, "Outfit 'a' is having a sale on Tobacco 'b'"
or "Tobacconist 'c' has pipes 'd' in stoke at price $ x.xx".
So long as they are only periodical and would be of special
interest to the group, those posts are most welcome.

|Please do not  binary files to this group.  No Jpegs, Gifs, etc.
|the members of ASP have decided that binary are not appopriate for this |group.  But you may post pointers to your binary files.  This decision was |made after long debate and a vote.  Please observe it.
        
  Political Discussions are tolerated on the group, so long as they
relate directly to Pipe smoking, and Pipe smoking issues.

<h3><a name="1.3">1.3  Layout of the FAQ</a></h3>
     In this it's first iteration,  the FAQ is broken down
into three parts. What you are reading is the first part. It
relates directly to Pipe Smoking. The second part relates to
Pipes and Tobaccos. The third relates to Pipe and Cigar
related stuff. The last two parts are culled from the Pipe
and Cigar Mailing list maintained by Steve Masticola.


<h2><a name="2.">2.   Beginning Pipe Smoking.</a></h2>

<h3><a name="2.1">2.1  How Do I select my first pipe?</a></h3>
     The flip answer to this is: "Pick one you like!"
     The more complete answer is that Pipe choice is no less
difficult than any other major life altering decision.:)


<h4><a name="2.1.1">2.1.1     General</a></h4>
     Choose a pipe that seems to fit your personality and
style. Your first pipe should be moderately priced on the
off chance that you don't like it.

  From: <a href="mailto:cboldt@earth">cboldt@earth</a> (Chuck Seyboldt)
   Shape   On picking a pipe, I had the experience that a
          straight pipe was more difficult to hold between the
          teeth.  My preference to a bent pipe was made a strong
          preference after repeatedly getting full tastes of "tar-
          water" from straight pipes that I inadvertently inclined
          before pipe-cleaning.

<h4><a name="2.1.2">2.1.2     Material</a></h4>
     Pick a briar pipe. Other materials are great, but
either take some getting used to (e.g. Clay and corncob) or
take some special care (e.g. Meerschaum)


<h4><a name="2.1.3">2.1.3     Filters</a></h4>
     Avoid filtering systems. This is a general rule, some
filtering systems do not alter the taste of the tobacco, but
most do. You should not be inhaling the smoke, so a filter
is superfluous. The major drawback to filtering systems is
that they tend to affect the taste of the tobacco if not
kept religiously clean.


<h4><a name="2.1.4">2.1.4     Seconds</a></h4>
     A "Second" pipe is one that has some kind of flaw. You
can some excellent pipes at a reduced rate because they have
surface flaws, (fills in the briar, mars of the finish,
imperfect carving etc.) that do not affect the smoke at all.
For your first pipe, the appearance of the pipe is not near
as important as the shape and size of the pipe.

  Getting a cheaper pipe allows you to experiment without
worrying too much about the cash investment.


<h4><a name="2.1.5">2.1.5     Size</a></h4>
     The thicker the walls of the pipe the cooler the smoke,
because of the larger surface area for cooling. Also more
wood there is in contact with the burning tobacco results in
greater moisture absorption. The flip side of this is that a
larger pipe is generally harder to keep lit and may hold too
much tobacco for an uninitiated smoker to comfortably
finish.


<h3><a name="2.2">2.2  How Do I select my first tobacco?</a></h3>
     This is another one that lends itself to the flip
answer in section 2.1


<h4><a name="2.2.1">2.2.1     General.</a></h4>
     Most beginning smokers will tend to go for an
"Aromatic" tobacco while those converting from cigars or
cigarettes will prefer an "English" or  "Natural" Tobacco.


<h4><a name="2.2.2">2.2.2     Drugstore Tobacco</a></h4>
     Connoisseurs of fine tobacco stay away from most
commercially available, or "drugstore" tobaccos. Primarily
because of the way those tobaccos are treated before getting
to the consumer. The main problem being the additives added
to the tobacco for preservation and "taste enhancement".
They tend to alter the way a tobacco smokes, generally not
for the better.

  Some Drugstore tobaccos which are not as bad as others are
Captain Black, Amphora, Prince Albert. These tend to be
less heavily altered than their counterparts.


<h4><a name="2.2.3">2.2.3     Aromatics</a></h4>
     A good aromatic tobacco is lightly cased or topped with
a natural flavoring. The better ones do not include any
additives at all. The caution is that Aromatics tend to be
moister tobaccos, which results in a hotter smoke. This can
be remedied with care in the preparation of the tobacco and
the pack of the pipe. (See sections 2.3 and 2.4).

  Aromatics tend to be a sweeter (almost candy-like
according to some) smoke.


<h4><a name="2.2.4">2.2.4     English</a></h4>
     The definition of an English tobacco varies widely from
tobacconist to tobacconist. Generally the label is applied
to tobaccos which include Latakia or Perique in various
amounts.

     English tobaccos tend to be a drier (in the same way
that a dry wine is dry) smoke.


<h4><a name="2.2.5">2.2.5     Naturals</a></h4>
     As the name implies these are unadulterated tobaccos.
The primary Naturals are Virginia, Burleys, Latakias,
Periques. The tastes vary but are generally a "cleaner"
smoke.


<h4><a name="2.2.6">2.2.6     Nicotine Content</a></h4>
     From: <a href="mailto:glp@netcom.com">glp@netcom.com</a> (Gregory Pease)
     Pipe tobaccos indeed contain nicotine, in varying
          amounts.  Looking at four common "families" might be
          enlightening.  Burleys, grown in the tobacco belt of North
          America, contain the highest percentage of nicotine of any
          tobacco produced, at about 3% by weight after curing and
          adjusted for moisture content.  This is followed by
          Virginias, which are about 2% nicotine, Maryland tobaccos at
          about 1.25% and finally Turkish at just over 1%.  Curing
          does affect the total nicotine content in the final product,
          but not [to] the same extent as it affects other qualities,
          most notably sugar content and pH.  Burleys have virtually
          no sugar (dextrose), while Virginias and Turkish leaf both
          contain significant sugar.  It is largely the pH which
          determines the "mellowness" of the tobacco as it is smoked,
          with more alkaline tobaccos tending toward greater "bite"
          and "host smoking" than the more acidic. Turkish and
          Virginias are slightly more acidic than Burleys, while
          Maryland is quite alkaline, relatively, and is therefore
          only used as a condiment tobacco, and never as a base.

         As to the relative intake of nicotine from pipes as
          compared with cigarettes, pipes *generally* provide
          less nicotine per gram, largely owing to the fact
          that pipe smokers rarely inhale, so nicotine
          absorption is mostly transcutaneous through the
          tissues of the mouth. Pipe smokers do not tend
          toward addiction as cigarette smokers do.


<h3><a name="2.3">2.3  How do I know If my tobacco is in good shape?</a></h3>
     As mentioned above, the moisture content of a tobacco
affects how it smokes and tastes. Here are a couple of ways
of finding out how yours is doing. At the ideal moistness, a
tobacco smokes dry and clean and leaves a white ash residue.
It can be smoked all the way to the bottom of the bowl
without ill effects. (pun intended)

<h4><a name="2.3.1">2.3.1     Tobacco Storage.</a></h4>

     From: <a href="mailto:clewis@psl.nmsu.edu">clewis@psl.nmsu.edu</a> (Craig Lewis)
     There are any number of different ways to store a
          pound.  I have 2 large, well-sealing ceramic jars (rubber
          gasket and screw-down lid), but these were a bit expensive.
          The storage jars with a gasket and a lever-based sealing lid
          should work well, and they're fairly inexpensive.  They also
          come in  several different sizes.  A combination of Ziploc
          bags and a Tupperware  container should also work fairly
          well;  I prefer to get all the excess air  out of the Ziploc
          bag first.


<h4><a name="2.3.2">2.3.2     The pinch test.</a></h4>
     Take a pinch of your tobacco and squeeze it tight for a
couple of seconds. Drop it on a paper towel. If it
immediately starts "unraveling", your tobacco is in perfect
shape. If it stays in a tight clump, it is too wet. If it
has crumbled to dust it is too dry.


<h4><a name="2.3.3">2.3.3     Drying it out.</a></h4>
     If your tobacco is too moist the best bet is to lay out
a small amount of it on a paper towel. Monitor it closely.
When it reaches the right consistency, Smoke It! The danger
here is to over-dry and end up with a very hot smoke. (see
item 2.9).


<h4><a name="2.3.4">2.3.4     Re-Moistening it.</a></h4>
     If your tobacco has dried out, if it hasn't been
sitting around too long, it is possible to revive it. (There
is point a point beyond which no amount of re-moistening is
going to restore the flavor of a tobacco. But that time span
is generally measured in years.)

     Method 1: The "organic" method. Put a moistening agent,
e.g. a slice of apple, or a strip of orange peel or a slice
of  bread or a slice of potato in with your tobacco.
Preferably there should be a permeable barrier between them
and the tobacco (for instance a sheet of paper towel.)
Monitor the setup closely. Don't let the tobacco get too wet
and Do NOT leave the moistening agent in there too long: It
will grow mold!

     Method 2: The "Hygrometer" method. I know this is not
an accurate name for it, but that's the best I could come
up. This is where you put in a small amount of water in a
small container which you put into your humidor. For
instance an airline sized booze bottle with a cotton wick.
The idea is that the moisture will remain in balance in the
humidor.


<h3><a name="2.4">2.4  Breaking in a pipe.</a></h3>
     Note The following only apply to Briar pipes.
Meerschaum, clay and corn cobs (are there any other
materials?) do NOT need a breaking in period.


<h4><a name="2.4.1">2.4.1     The objective: A cake.</a></h4>
     The objective of a break in period is to build up a
cake around the inside of the bowl.  A cake is the charred
residue tobacco leaves behind. An ideal cake is about the
thickness of a US Penny (1 cent)
     From: <a href="mailto:cboldt@earth">cboldt@earth</a> (Chuck Seyboldt)
        A penny is about 1.3 mm thick, a dime is about 1.1 mm thick. 
        Each is a little less than a sixteenth of an inch.

      If the cake is too thick, it may end up cracking the bowl
because of the pressure. (See section 2.8.4)

     From: <a href="mailto:skizyx@io.com">skizyx@io.com</a> (Jan ilauem-arluth Tomaszewski kailin-er)
     Actually, the breaking in process is to protect your
          briar. The coating  of carbon acts as a heat shield so you
          don't burn a hole in a naturally  combustible substance:
          wood (even though briar is remarkably resistant to fire, it
          *will* burn if there is no carbon layer and you smoke too
          fast.


<h4><a name="2.4.2">2.4.2     The honey coating method.</a></h4>
     New briar pipes can sometimes benefit from a coating of
honey prior to the first smoke. This encourages the charring
around the bowl. Take a small amount of honey and mix it
with a couple of drops of water. You want a fairly thin
paste. Coat inside of bowl with paste. Do not get it on the
outside. (Just messy...)


<h4><a name="2.4.3">2.4.3     Slow smoke-in</a></h4>
     On first getting a pipe, it is advisable to smoke it in
slowly and not rush the break in period. One method is to
only fill the pipe a third full for the first several
smokes, then a half full for several more, then all the way
full. In all instances, smoke the pipe all the way to the
bottom. (See section 2.3 and 2.5 for some recommendations on
how to achieve this.)

     Note: Some have said that recent developments in pipe
making result in the briar not being as "green", so that a
pipe can filled all the way from the first smoke and does
not need to be honey coated.


<h3><a name="2.5">2.5  How Do I pack my first pipe?</a></h3>
     Tobacco packing is a key element in a good smoke. An
ideal pack offers resistance to the draw. The ideal
resistance is a matter of preference, but generally if it is
about the same as sipping a drink through a straw it is
about right.


<h4><a name="2.5.1">2.5.1     The three layer pack.</a></h4>
     The objective of the three layer pack is to end up with
three layers of tobacco in the pipe. The bottom most layer
will be the loosest, the middle one a bit tighter, the top
one the tightest. One way to achieve this is to just drop
the tobacco in for the bottom layer. Drop the tobacco in and
tamp it down for the middle layer, drop the tobacco in and
tamp it down a lot for the top layer. When all done the
tobacco should fell "springy" to the touch. If it has no
give at all, it's packed too tight. If a touch leaves an
indentation, it is packed too loosely.


<h4><a name="2.5.2">2.5.2     The swirl method</a></h4>
     Take a handful of tobacco, make sure that it is loose
and as stem free as possible. Hold the tobacco in one hand,
with the hand relaxed enough that the palm forms a shallow
crucible. Hold the pipe in the other hand. Put the pipe,
bowl opening down, over the palm of your tobacco hand and,
putting very slight downward pressure, rotate the bowl in a
counterclockwise direction. You will find that the tobacco
will "rise" into the bowl. You may want to experiment with
tamping and swirling alternatively to get the perfect pack.
This method tends to work best with non cases tobaccos.


<h3><a name="2.6">2.6  How do I light my first pipe?</a></h3>

<h4><a name="2.6.1">2.6.1     Match light.</a></h4>
     The tobacco connoisseur's ideal lighting means is a
wooden match, although regular matches work just as well.
Light the match and hold it for a second or two while the
sulfur burns out. Bring the match to the tobacco surface
and, while puffing gently, move the match around the tobacco
in a slow even circle. (See section 2.7)


<h4><a name="2.6.2">2.6.2     Lighter light</a></h4>
     Lighting a pipe with a lighter is exactly the same as
lighting with a match inasmuch as it takes a slow circular
motion to get the tobacco evenly lit. The big caution with
lighters is to keep them as far away from the pipe surfaces
as possible to avoid possible charring of the bowl. Ideally
a pipe lighter is a better bet than a regular lighter,
because their flame tends to be directed downwards allowing
for more control.


<h3><a name="2.7">2.7  How do I keep my first pipe lit?</a></h3>
     If your pipe is well broken in (see 2.4) and your
tobacco is in good condition  (see 2.3) it is not
unreasonable to expect a bowl-full to stay lit all the way
through. On the other hand, it is not unusual to have to re-
light a couple of times, specially towards the bottom of the
bowl. Remember that the name of the game is allowing the
burning tobacco to "breathe".


<h4><a name="2.7.1">2.7.1     The charring light.</a></h4>
     The best bet for keeping a pipe lit is to get it lit
right the first time. The objective is to have an even ember
of burning tobacco throughout the whole smoke. One way of
doing this is to char the top of the tobacco. When you first
light up (see 2.6) allow the first light to die out after a
couple of puffs. Tamp it down to a smooth flat surface then
re-light.


<h4><a name="2.7.2">2.7.2     Tamping.</a></h4>
     While smoking, ash residue will form at the top of the
bowl. This residue will insulate the actually burning
tobacco from oxygen. So it is advisable to keep it tamped
down so that there is a minimal layer of it on top of the
tobacco. The main reason to tamp down the ash, instead of
emptying it out, is that it promotes a nice even cake. (See
section 2.4).


<h4><a name="2.7.3">2.7.3     Smoking pace.</a></h4>
     The pace at which you smoke is as important a factor as
any other factor. Pace is the rhythm at which you take puffs
from your tobacco. With experimentation you will achieve the
perfect pace for you. The idea is to keep the tobacco lit
and hot enough that you are enjoying the smoke. Too slow and
the tobacco will keep going out. Too fast and you will
probably burn your tongue and not enjoy the smoke all that
much.


<h3><a name="2.8">2.8  How do I clean my pipe?</a></h3>
     "Cleanliness is next to Godliness. This particularly
true of pipes." Because all kinds of residues are left
behind when tobacco burns, it is critical to the enjoyment
of pipe smoking that the pipe be kept clean at all times.
Note: There is a fine line between clean and sterile. You
are not aiming for sterile!

     CAUTION: Never Ever, Ever, take a stem out of a pipe
while it is still hot. Allow it to cool for at least an hour
before attempting to remove it. Removing a stem from a pipe
while it is still hot can result in either a broken stem, or
a cracked tenon!


<h4><a name="2.8.1">2.8.1     Cleaning during smokes.</a></h4>
     While smoking, it is considered good practice to
periodically run a pipe cleaner through the stem. Do not
force the cleaner, simply rotating it as if inserting a
screw will generally do the trick.  This is a particularly
tricky procedure with bent pipes, but with practice and
patience it is achievable.


<h4><a name="2.8.2">2.8.2     Cleaning between smokes.</a></h4>
     When done with a bowl-full, if you have smoked the
tobacco all the way through and are smoking under ideal
conditions (see all sections above), you will have ended up
with a light white ashy residue which you can simply scoop
out of the bowl. (Note: If you can do this consistently,
nominate yourself for the pipe smokers hall of fame!) The
idea is to leave no tobacco, or tobacco residues in the bowl
when it is not being smoked. This allows the pipe to air dry
completely and will result in a sweeter smoke in the long
run. Clean out the stem thoroughly with a pipe cleaner.
(Read Caution above). Put the pipe up in a pipe rack. (Note:
There are two schools of thought on storing the pipe, one is
to leave a pipe cleaner in the stem to absorb as much gunk
as possible. The second is to leave the stem clear, allowing
for air drying of all components.)


<h4><a name="2.8.3">2.8.3     Cleaning periodically.</a></h4>
     Periodically you may want to clean out the stem and
bowl (interior only !) with an alcohol based cleaner.
Recommendations for the cleaning solution vary from
Isopropyl Alcohol all the way to Jack Daniels. There are
also commercially available pipe sweeteners. Your choice
should be made based on what kind of taste you want left in
your pipe... Regardless of the choice, the method is always
the same: Dip a pipe cleaner in the solution and run it
through the stem. Repeat until the cleaner comes out clean.
Pour some of the solution in the bowl and let sit overnight.
Be very very careful not to get any on the finish! Note: It
is not recommended to clean the bowl out this way with
Meerschaum pipes.

  From: <a href="mailto:cboldt@earth">cboldt@earth</a> (Chuck Seyboldt)
   Cleaning solutions .. I would avoid the mention of
          isopropyl alcohol, or strongly discourage its use.
          [Instead use] grain alcohol (NOT wood alcohol) as a
          cleaning agent.

     From: <a href="mailto:glp@netcom.com">glp@netcom.com</a> (Gregory Pease)
     With a pipe cleaner in the shank and drafthole of the
          pipe,  fill the bowl with salt, and *moisten* it with grain
          spirits.  The alcohol will dissolve the tar, and the salt
          will draw it out of the cake/wood.  After about 24-hours,
          dump the now dry, but very ugly salt, and let the pipe air
          out for a few days.  Be sure not to get alcohol on the
          finish, as it will also dissolve wax and some dyes.  It can
          also leach sulphur from the vulcanite of the stem, and
          increase discolouration there.


<h5><a name="2.8.3.1">2.8.3.1   Calabash Cleaning</a></h5>
     From: <a href="mailto:msftman@aol.com">msftman@aol.com</a> (MSFTMAN)( Steve Banks)
     Remove the bowl and stem from the gourd and set that
          aside. Find a nice bowl or glass that will allow you to
          stand the gourd "up" in. Fill the gourd with regular table
          salt or Kosher salt. Then pour some grain alcohol like vodka
          (I use isopropyl alcohol) in the gourd until all of the salt
          is saturated "a mushy mixture." Let this mixture sit for at
          least 24 hours. The salt draws all of the impurities out of
          the gourds walls. Scoop out all of the salt (it'll be pretty
          dry by then) shake the pipe a little to get more salt out.
          Then pour a little more spirits in the bowl and swish it
          around. Pour it out via the stem hole. Take a rag and twist
          it in and down through the gourd until it looks pretty dry
          and clean inside also making sure that you wipe the "cork"
          gaskets very well (you don't want these to swell.) Let it
          air dry for about two days.

         To harden the bowl, turn the bowl upside down and
          take a lighter or match to the black deposits
          clinging to the bottom of the bowl until they light
          by themselves. This hardens the meerschaum and
          helps prevent its deterioration by running cleaners
          through the bowls bottom hole and or reaming.

     From: <a href="mailto:mikhail@onramp.net">mikhail@onramp.net</a> (Sami Mikhail)|
     Do NOT replace the bowl back into the gourd after filling it 
      with the salt/alcohol mixture. The bowl WILL crack,irreparably.
         

<h4><a name="2.8.4">2.8.4     Drastic cleaning measures.</a></h4>
     If the cake in the bowl gets too thick, or if the pipe
starts to taste bitter, or draw unevenly etc. it is time for
cleaning measures. If you have the time and the money, the
best bet is to let a reputable tobacconist do the cleaning
for you. If you want to do it yourself, use extreme caution.


<h5><a name="2.8.4.1">2.8.4.1   Reaming.</a></h5>
     Using a good quality reamer, thin the cake out
gradually. The best approach is to take off thin even layers
from the top of the bowl, all the way to the bottom and
repeat until the cake is the desired thickness. Do not
scrape it all of, because you will have to break the pipe in
again and you may damage the walls of the pipe. Note: Be
particularly careful with Meerschaum bowls as the walls are
very very soft.


<h5><a name="2.8.4.2">2.8.4.2   Alcohol Purifying.</a></h5>
     This is best left to a professional, but the idea is to
run alcohol heated just below (or is it just above) it's
boiling point through the stem and out the bowl.


<h5><a name="2.8.4.3">2.8.4.3   Bleach washing.</a></h5>
     If a stem is very yellow or very bitter tasting, it
might benefit from a soaking in a mildly concentrated bleach
and water solution overnight. Then it can be rubbed out with
olive oil for a dark finish.


<h5><a name="2.8.4.4">2.8.4.4   Stem polishing.</a></h5>
     Another approach to clean a stem is to use a very fine
polishing compound and a buffing wheel to achieve the
desired finish. The dangers of this method are burned out or
broken stems.


<h3><a name="2.9">2.9  Why does my pipe not stay lit?</a></h3>
     The primary causes for a pipe not staying lit are:
        1.   Tobacco too moist: See 2.3
        2.   Pipe not broken in correctly: See 2.4
        3.   Smoking "ritual" is off: see 2.7


<h3><a name="2.10">2.10 Why is my tongue charred?</a></h3>
     The primary causes of  tongue charring are:
        1.   Tobacco too moist or too dry: See 2.3
        2.   Smoking too fast: see 2.7.3

<h3><a name="2.11">2.11 Why is my pipe gurgling?</a></h3>
     The primary causes of a gurgling pipe are:
        1.   Tobacco too moist: See 2.3
        2.   Saliva in the pipe: One of the side effects of smoking
  is a natural tendency for the mouth to salivate. The saliva
  has one of three places to go: Down the stem into the bowl,
  it is swallowed, it is spit out. It is generally best to do
  one of the last two and keep the mouth as dry as possible
  during the smoke to avoid gurgling.
        3.   Some tobaccos, primarily aromatics, tend to leave more
  liquid residue than others. The only help for those is to
  keep the pipe clean during the smoke,  see 2.8.1

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1  Taking care of loose Stems.</a></h3>
     From: <a href="mailto:markeh@netcom.com">markeh@netcom.com</a> (MarkH)
     [A]fter heating the tenon (the end of the stem that
          goes into the briar), lightly push the end of the tenon into
          a solid object (like the edge of a table or tile
          drainboard). This expands the tenon evenly in all
          directions, without making it out of round.  BE CAREFUL - a
          little goes a long way. I supplied heat from my pipe lighter
          - constantly moving the stem over the flame to not scorch
          it, but hot water would probably work just as well. If the
          tenon is really hot, some of the vulcanite might stain
          whatever you push into.

         You can't tell if you have been successful until
          the stem cools to room temperature. When its hot,
          it will fit snug (or too snug - and break the pipe)
          even if you do nothing.  Better to heat/cool/try
          through a few cycles than to overdo it, as you will
          then have to sand down the tenon and start all
          over.

    From: <a href="mailto:BUBBAMIKE@delphi.com">BUBBAMIKE@delphi.com</a>
     If [the stem is] Lucite try coating the end with some
          clear nail polish and then sanding to fit.

     (Ed. note:  the original 3-year matured was truely a 3 year
      matured red virginia with NO fruit essence!:  I know, since
      I have sampled tins of the original blend dated as far back
      as 1949!!.  It is beyond my comprehension that Dunhill would
      take a marvelous old blend like 3-year matured and add
      fruit essence to it  :-(    )

     a company named "Savoury's, Ltd.  There were 5 or so different
     Baby's Bottom blends back in the 1950's and 1960's )



                         Dunhill "White Spot"
                       ________________________
     A fairly Full bodied smoke that has 35% Latakia, with added
     Red Virginia and Turkish.  A VERY ENGLISH blend!

    (Ed. comment:  I believe this is a resurrection of an older
     Dunhill blend, also named "White Spot" )


 ******
 ( Ed. Note:  This is only a partial listing.  Dunhill in London still
   produce other blends.  Many are tinned.  Dunhill will also make up blends
   for a customer under the "My Mixture" label.
   (I believe a version of YE OLDE SYGNE" is still produced))


   Note further:  I am NOT in any way associated with Dunhill of London.
   This editor has merely sampled many of these blends in both their old
   versions, and these newer examples.

<p>Plantation Evening, #416, and Pirate Kake, #970P, continue to go off
the charts. The reception for these two blends has been amazing and

be ready to introduce for several months.

OK; Tobacco Road, Shelby, NC; Burning Desires, Cincinnati, OH; and Onix

<body>
<h1>101 ways to respond when someone asks you to put your cigar out</h1>
<ol>
<li> "Is it the smoke that bothers you, or the sight of someone enjoying himself?"
<li> (The Response Literal:) "Put out _this_ cigar? Seems kind of silly, but sure. Now wait a sec while I light another..."
<li> (The Response Coy:) "I'd love to, but I'm afraid you'd think I'm easy."
<li> (The Response Ingenuous:) "What a coincidence! You're the third person to ask me tha---oh, it's _you_ again."
<li> (The Response Juvenile:) "Who died and made you the Fun Patrol?"
<li> (The Response Existential:) "What does it matter?"
<li> (The Response Newlywed:) "Gosh, darling, our first fight. And just think, we'll be able to repeat it every time I light up."
<li> (The Response Recidivist:) "My parole officer says it steadies my nerves."
<li> (The Lie Direct:) "I'm not smoking."
<li> (The Lie Circimstantial:) "Were I smoking, your request, however rude, might be worthy of reply."
<li> (The Retort Courteous, to female jerk:) "My cigar is beautifully made, gives pleasure, and is silent. You, madam, posess two of these virtues."
<li> (The Countercheck Quarrelsome:) "If I do, sir, upon whom shall we blame the stink?" [Or madam.]
<li> (The Quip Modest, to female jerk:) "Madam, your advances are untimely and unexpected, but not unwelcome. Perhaps after I've finished this cigar."
<li> (The Reproof Valiant, to male jerk:) "Sir, we are both blowing smoke, but I at least have the courtesy to be smoking a fine cigar."
<li> (Among Yuppies:) "It depends. How much do you make?"
<li> (Among Trivial Pursuers:) "Wait! Don't tell me! `Put out that #(!&!$ cigar!' Bogey. _Casablanca_. 1943. And Ingrid Bergman replies, `Why do I only get that from guys who are lousy in bed?'"
<li> "No one said anything about my cigar when I was raising the flag on Iwo Jima." [Or liberating Kuwait City.]
<li> (Among Wassailers:) "No, and all God's blessings this holiday season."
<li> (The Charles Bronson:) "Any other last requests?"
<li> (The Emily Post:) "I've often wondered which is ruder: smoking a cigar or interrupting a total stranger?"
<li> (The Clint Eastwood:) "Think of me as a grenade. This cigar is my pin.  I might be a dud of a grenade. Well, punk, do you feel lucky today? Is he a dud or a live grenade? Go ahead, pull my pin."
<li> (The Tom Paine:) "No, but I'll defend to the death your right to ask me."
<li> (The Randy Newman:) "Your growth is already stunted; don't worry about mine."
<li> "Let me know if there's anything _you_ enjoy. I'll come around and ask _you_ to stop."
<li> (At a singles bar:) "I can't. I'm researching a novel."
<li> (At a singles bar; Some Like It Haughty:) "What a great icebreaker! I applaud your moxie. If I were of your class, I would never dream of approaching someone like me."
<li> (At a singles bar; the Fool's Bluff:) "I'm an artist. My medium is smoke."
<li> (At a singles bar; the Cut Indirect:) "Doctors say people with sensitive noses are sexually repressed. Kiss me."
<li> (At a singles bar, for a female jerk:) "I'm sorry. I mistook you for a woman in her prime."
<li> (At a singles bar, for a male jerk:) "I'm sorry. I mistook you for a straight."
<li> "If I can't smoke near lowlife like you, where can I smoke?"
<li> (At a class reunion:) "Does the smoke bother your nose job?"
<li> (At the wheel:) "No problem. I don't need a cigar to keep me awake...  not at night... zz-zz-zzzzzz..."
<li> (At a house party:) "I see our host invited all kinds."
<li> (At a barbecue:) "I'm just doing this to keep bugs away. Guess it isn't working."
<li> (At a wrestling match:) "Why? Is it interfering with your enjoyment of mindless violence?" [Also suitable for football, hockey, or most TV.]
<li> "If I do, what will it leave you to whine about?"
<li> (The Team Player's Move:) "I'd like to help you out. It's just that you caught me at a bad time---I'm smoking a cigar right now."
<li> (The Backhand Return:) "God, I admire people who aren't afraid to be disliked."
<li> (The Pensive Parry:)  [pause to savor your cigar] "Every time I light up, somebody asks me that."
<li> (The Sympathy Play:) "Don't you know I only have a week to live? Who put you up to this?"
<li> (The Sicilian Gambit:) "Sure, I'll put it out. Vinnie --- remember that face."
<li> (The Appeal to Simple Justice:) "You're the third person to ask me that. And if I said yes now, it wouldn't be fair to the others."
<li> (The NRA Recoil:) "If cigars are outlawed, only outlaws will have cigars."
<li> (The Civil Servant Squelch:) "I'm only authorized to light 'em, not put 'em out. You need a GS-17. Besides, I'm on my lunch break."
<li> (The Diner's Club:) "Put out that food. I'm trying to smoke."
<li> (The Postprandial Cordial:) "Oops, I don't have an ashtray. Would you pass me your plate?"

<li> "I'll bet you're looking forward to martial law."
<li> (When in Moscow; the Red Scare:) "Give me your name and the names of all who feel this way."
<li> (The California Turn-down:) "I hear you. I know where you're coming from. I just can't get behind it."
<li> (The Hell's Kitchen Kiss-off:) "What difference does it make? You'll still be ugly."
<li> "You must have a lot to think about."
<li> (To a wealthy snob:) "Why? Are you waiting around for the butt?"
<li> (To a health nut:) "I'll have you know this cigar is natural, organic, and without artificial ingredients, which is more than I can say for your Gore-tex shorts, granola breath!"
<li> (To a lawyer:) "I hope you're not singling me out. You get paid good money to torment people." [Also works with doctors and dentists.]
<li> (To a flashy dresser:) "Sure, if you'll turn down the volume on your jacket."
<li> (To a four-year-old:) "Make me."
<li> (To a pretty woman:) "Yes, but that can not extinguish the fire in (a) my heart. (b) your eyes. (c) your hair."
<li> (To an indignant young thing:) "I like a filly with spirit."
<li> (To a feminist:) "You've got the wrong guy. I'm neither your father nor all men."
<li> (To a dog owner:) "Certainly. [to dog:] Gimme paw."
<li> (To a dog-walker in the park:) "Sure. Say, there's something on the bottom of my shoe. Could you kind of flick it off for me?"
<li> (To a foreigner:) [Point to your watch and say loudly] "It's three twenty-five!"
<li> (To a gum-chewer) "I'd like to, but unlike you, I can't stick my oral fixation under a table."

<li> "Can I see some ID?"
<li> (The Phil Donahue smarm-out:) [loudly] "Thank you for sharing. Let's open it up. [using cigar as microphone] How does the rest of the restaurant feel? Help me out here!" [This can backfire!]
<li> (At a nice four-star French restaurant:) [loudly] "Hey, buddy! If you don't have any money, you should have thought of that before you ordered!"

<li> (At the deli:) [loudly] "No, I won't sign your petition to pardon Nazi war criminals!"

Which do you prefer?  Straight-stem or bent?  Personally, I'd say bent
because the moment arm is shorter, i.e. doesn't feel as heavy, but that
doesn't matter if you're going to hold the pipe in your hand most of the time.

	Also, do you hold the pipe by the stem or the bowl? 
	You're supposed to hold it from the stem so as not to let
your own oils discolour the bowl, but then again... ahh...well.

	What's your favorite blend?

From: ????????@????.???????.??? (Steve)

Well, most of my pipes are bent, but I have some straight ones too,
including a nice bulldog from a French maker called Gefapip, a
Canadian by GBD, and an I-don't-know-what-it-is by Savinelli. (It's
small and has a roughly cylindrical bowl and a stem with a bulge near
the shank.) I was in the local Tinder Box admiring a beautiful bent
black GBD today, so my taste hasn't changed that much.

I had thought the same thing about moment arms, too, but just bought a
lot of bent pipes because I thought they looked cool. (Aesthetics, not
heat transfer :-). Actually it's true. If you've ever smoked an Oom
Paul, you'll probably notice that it's a lot easier to hold between
your teeth than a straight or even a half-bent pipe.

I've never heard that about skin oil discoloring the bowl; actually I
thought the opposite was true. Briar pipes, unless they have a really
rough surface, are coated with carnauba wax (a very hard wax; I don't
know from whence it comes.) Finger oils wouldn't matter very much on a
wax surface. Besides, I think it's a little silly to hold a pipe by
the stem unless the bowl is _very_ hot.

Meerschaums, of course, are a different story. They're very delicate,
and acquire coloration as they're smoked. What actually gets colored
is a thin layer of beeswax on top of the meerschaum. Your fingers can
stick to this wax coating and strip it off. Result: a thumbprint on
the finish.

Favorite blend? I don't know; you got one? (I'm serious; I'm looking
to experiment.) When I was in my teens and early twenties, I used to
smoke Amphora just about always. Later I abandoned that for an
English-style blend made by Harry Tint in Philadelphia (which, BTW, is
an excellent shop). Then, for about three years, I've been smoking
"Bean's Special Blend" (yes, by L.L. Bean, the same folks that brought
you Bean's Maine Hunting Shoe and Bean's Sony CD Player.) They've
discontinued that, and I'm at the bottom of my last can. Yesterday, on
Elias Mazur's example (Elias is the co-founder of the newsgroup, and
has taken much flame for trying to establish rec.pipes), I went out
and bought a can of Black Sobranie 759. Delicious! I haven't had
Latakia in ages (I remembered it from _one_ can of some Dunhill
mixture I bought for myself when I was an undergrad.) At the Tinder
Box today, I bought a couple of pouches of some of the store's
"English-style" tobacco; they smell nice, but I've only smoked the
"Sherlock's Choice" (not that that means anything to someone not
living in this part of New Jersey, probably.)

In any case, I don't think I'm going to spend several years with one
blend anymore. I'd like to learn blending and maybe blend my own; is
there anyone out there who has done this? Also, if you like "English"
(non-aromatic) tobacco, I'd appreciate hearing your preferences.
Thanks! 

Yr. obd't. servant,
- Steve (????????@????.???????.???)

(BTW, also, thanks for the quote, Maverick... please send yours in, if
you have a favorite!)

Hi.

First I would like to welcome you all again to the pipes mailgroup. I
fell particularly happy for the creation of the mailgroup, considering
the quantity of flames I got by trying to start the rec.pipes
newsgroup. I am sure that in a near future we will have enough traffic
to justify a newsgroup, moderated, of course. I would also like to
thank Steve Masticol for bringing my idea of a pipes newsgroup into
life.

Well, I am an EE graduate student from Brazil (great excuse for
grammar errors :-) ), in Syracuse University, and I've been in the US
for two and half years. I started smoking pipe about 9 years ago. My
collection is small (13), but is steadily growing. My collection is
divided half bent and half straight stem, mostly because it was
difficult to buy good pipes back in my hometown in Brazil, so I could
not be very picky. My first pipe was a BBB straight stem billiard
style, that my father bought in 1960 and smoked only a couple of
times, in a unsuccesful attempt to quit cigarette smoking. I don't
know if it is for sentimental reasons or for the quality, but it's
still my favorite pipe. Nowdays, I buy most of my pipes bent stems,
like Steve, for aesthetic reasons. I have GBD's, Petersen, Savinelli,
Barling (very good). I also have a nice calabash, Sherlock Holmes
style, with a meerschaum bowl. It is a cool smoke, and the bowl is
turning into a beautiful deep yellow color.

Yesterday I just bought a beatiful bent stem pipe from a italian pipe
maker, Aldo Vilani. I bought in a pipe shop in Utica, Pipes Unlimited,
that I learned about from the The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris. It is a
very nice pipe shop, and the owner, a pipe smoker/collector/expert, Mr
Bob Smith, is a very nice person, very polite, and is always there to
have a chat about pipes. He is the kind of tabaconnist that one wishes
to deal with. He explains about the pipes, the makers, the history of
the maker, new trends, and does NOT try to 'sell' you any pipe. He
lets you choose the one that better suits you. When he saw that I kind
of fell for one pipe, he gave me a great deal on it. I recommend it to
anyone living Upstate New York, or coming this way. If someone is
interested in the address, let me know.


With tobacco blends my story is also related to the fact that few
good tobaccos could be purchased in my hometown. I used to smoke
Amphora's as well, when I could find it. Sometimes my father would
travel to the US or Europe, and would bring me some good tobacco. Now
I only smoke English blends. I can't say that I have a favorite, but
mixtures of Virginia with Latakia specially attracts me. I like some
Dunhill blends, as well as the Balkan Sobraine. I'm glad Steve enjoyed
my suggestion of Balkan Sobraine. I just bought the 759 Balkan today.
I once mix the Half-and-Half with pure Latakia, and the result was
excellent. I really enjoy this home made mixture. I will try new
mixtures soon.

Well, after writing all this about my pipes and blends, there is only
one way to go: drink a nice tea and smoke my new pipe.


              "Give a man a pipe he can smoke,
              Give a man a book he can read,
              And his home is bright with a calm delight,
              Though the room be poor indeed."

                                 Alfred Dunhill ( The Pipe Book )

Have you all a good and relaxing smoke.

<a name="1">Subject: An unscheduled mailing</a>

Well, I'd planned on mailing only once every week or so, but there
have been so many letters coming in that I thought it would be nice to
go ahead and let some out of the mailbag, and get some good threads
going. (Perhaps in the context of pipes, it should be "wisps"? :-)

I'd also like to thank Elias Mazur, the co-founder of the pipes
mailgroup, for suggesting the idea in the first place and having the
courage to put it on the net. Without Elias, it probably wouldn't have
happened, and I'd have never learned about Balkan Sobranie. Elias
apparently got rather harsh treatment from the newsgroups he posted
to; I don't know whether I'm getting flamed or not, because I'm taking
the precaution of not reading the groups I posted to! :-) (Seriously,
I've only gotten a couple of nasty letters, but given Gene Spafford's
dictum to crosspost rather than post separately, I think I'm within
net.etiquette; and you can't argue with the results!)

In any case, thanks to all for joining, and I hope you enjoy the
mailgroup as much as I'm enjoying putting it together. I hope you'll
join me in lighting a bowl of your favorite blend.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Introduction</a>

I am an x pipe smoker who really misses the enjoyment of the pipe.
The reasons I am not currently endulging are many and in future
letters I will probably discuss them.  Suffice it to say that I
*really* enjoyed my pipe and whenever I get a whiff of a good tobacco
the urge is really strong to start again.  

I am not a pipe or tobacco expert and only own a couple of not really
very distinguished pipes.  But that is, at present, irrelevent. 

I look forward to reading about pipes and discussing them with others
on this list (as time permits).  I especially look forward to learning
more pipe lore, tobacco lore, etc.

<a name="3">Subject:  Pipes always...</a>


Hi Steve,

Half-and-Half, if I recall correctly, is half burley and half
virginia. They are pure tobacco. When I was in Brazil I got a big can,
and used to smoke it often, straight. I must confess that although it
was a pleasurable smoke, certainly wasn't superb. I felt that there
was something missing. When I got here I bought another can and kept
smoking straight. One day I visited a pipe store here at Syracuse, and
bought pure Latakia. The person at the store told me it was very
strong and I should mix with a lighter tobacco. That's when I had the
idea of mixing them. Most of English blend follow the same principle.
In Hacker's book there is a good description of most common tobaccos
and what are they properties, such as how hot it burns. I will
summarize them and will pass to the mailgroup.

I don't know if I mentioned, but I tried recently a Dunhill mixture
called 'Elizabethan Mixture'. I never saw it before and decided to
try. It is very good. It has a bit of Perique, which is a Lousiana
tobacco that adds a zesty taste to it. I think it is worth a try.

Good smokes.

Elias.

[ Always! -S.]

<a name="4">Subject: Heel Cake</a>

One of the reasons I'm glad to see this mailgroup is that I may finally
get an answer to a question that's tormented me for years!  My problem
is (snif!) ... I can't seem to develop a good heelcake!  The sides of
the bowl seem to break in just fine, but the heel never seems to follow
suit.  It always seems to get too damp down there.  I've tried different
tobaccos, smoking slowly, smoking more quickly, cleaning less often, more
often, burning match after match even after nothing down there seems to
light, and still it stays slick &amp; clean!  Any suggestions?

By the bye, I would have to be classified as a light smoker.  Not only
do I not smoke every day, I don't even smoke every week!  But I love
a good pipe, with a glass of Armagnac, Calvados, Port, or Barleywine,
in the evening.  I incline toward bent stems and aromatic tobaccos,
and would some day like to own a good long-stem "churchwarden" pipe.

I have been working with wood for a long time now.  In fact,  I learned
about this mailgroup from the posting in rec.woodworking.  I would like
to begin making my own pipes, but I don't know where to begin.  Is there
a good reference source?  How about supplies?  I have access to people
who travel to Northern Italy quite a bit.  I understand that Italy has
a lot of pipe blanks,  does anyone know where I can find them?

[There's a company in Chicago called Pimo's that sells briars, stems,
tools, etc. for pipemaking. I'll dig out the reference, if no one else
in pipe-land has it {it's about 100 miles away, in my parents'
cellar}. I've tried it myself, and even bought a flex-shaft to work
with; pipe carving is a hard skill to acquire. Can anyone help Norm

		Pipes Digest #4 [March 11, 1989]

Dear pipe people,

Well, things are rolling in the mailgroup! Our ranks have grown to 22
members, and new people are still joining every day from all around
the country. (BTW, did my original posting have world distribution? I
tried, but I'm not sure I made it...)

I've had a thought for something you might want to try; this seems
like a perfect place to swap pipes. There are two ways we could
organize such a thing: either direct (person-to-person) or a "mystery
pipe" swap; I'd be willing to organize the latter, as long as people
send postage along with a pipe to swap. Person-to-person swaps are, of
course, fine any time.  Are y'all interested?

Speaking of which, I'm interested in finding a hose pipe of some kind.
I've seen them in shops, and had always thought it would be good to
set one on the desk and puff away while working. If anyone has one,
I'll trade for a pipe of comparable value, or cash.

Well, it's time to dig out the Persian slipper for a bowl of shag, and
edit the remainder of this week's letters. Hope to hear from you soon.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Hi,
	I'm Ami Silberman, a graduate student in Computer Science at the
University of Illinois.  I've been a pipe smoker for about 6 years.
Currently, I use about three pipes, one is an old Dr. Grabow, which I use
for highly resinated tobaccos, one is a reproduction 19th century English
clay pipe (you can get them for a couple of bucks, they are made from 
copies of the original molds), and a very unusual Meershaum Bulldog which
I bought used.  (Used pipes are often a very good bargain.)  My tastes
in tobaccos run toward the unflavored, although I do appreciate a little
vannilla or almond, especially in cavendish.  I like Black Cavindish straight,
mixed burly and cavendish, and also blends with Latakia.  I usually alternate
or tobaccos, so I am unlikely to have more than one pipeful of the same blend
in any given day. (Currently I'm working on about 10 different bags of
tobacco.)

I occasionally smoke a cigar, and somewhat more often smoke
ciggaretes.  I've tried Davidhoff's (too dry), Royal Dragoons (by
Simon Artz, Cairo, very yummy), various clove types, and several other
Turkish types.  I had a Galois once, and thought it was the French
equivelent to a Camel.  I think I'll go home and review some
tobaccos...

One thing I would like to see in this mailing list is a review of various
comercial blends, as well as house blends.  Most pipe shops carry various semi-
standard blends, i in addition, they are willing to make custom blends.
We can pass on "recipies" in this way.

Did you know that Aleister Crowley used to smoke straight perrouque (I may have
missed the spelling, it's that really pungent fermented stuff.)

[A number of good ideas, Ami! I checked out the Lahaska, PA flea
market for pipes today; alas. I was disappointed. What would you like
to see in the reviews? We can kick the idea around a little more; is
there anyone who'd like to review their favorite blend [or warn us
about one :-9 ? -S.]

&gt;us about yourself by return mail? We'd like to hear about your

I'm a gradual student in computer science and I've been smoking a pipe
off and on for almost ten years now.  I started in earnest when I was a
freshman in college.  There is a tobacconist across the street from the
frosh dorms, and I imagine that at some point or other about half the
males wander over and buy a pipe and some tobacco and try to acquire
the habit.  In my case it stuck.  The name of the place is Leavitt and
Pierce, and they are affiliated with J.P. Erlich in Boston.  Both are
very fine tobacconists, and L&amp;P has a one-third-off-everything-in-the-
store sale every year around the end of March.  

I have a number of pipes, but most of them are Erlich's house brand.
These range in quality (and price) from el cheapo (which smoke okay, but
don't look too great) to medium priced/quality (in the $50-60 range).
They have some very nice pipes as well, but I never felt like dropping
that much money on a pipe.  I prefer bent stems since there's very
little worse (for me) than a mouthful of pipe juice.  I don't know what
you'd call my favorite design, but it looks something like: ~\V i.e.  the
stem is bent, but not very rounded, and the bowl has a distinctly
pointed bottom.  Sort of something you'd expect a teenage wizard-in-
training to smoke :-).

In addition, I have a beautiful meerschaum, straight-stemmed Canadian
style pipe that my father gave me for Christmas about 5 or 6 years ago
that is turning interesting shades of caramel in various places.  That is
definitely the coolest smoking pipe I have.  I have the obligatory
calabash for solving crimes (got it for about $25 during one of the
one-third off sales).  And I got a church warden from L&amp;P sometime back
there, which is cool smoking pipe, but tends to really collect
condensation and can be a bitch to clean.  All in all I have about a
dozen pipes.

My favorite tobacco is cherry cavendish; in fact, it's all I smoke.  I
guess I'm sort of conservative on this, and after I read a few more
recommendations here, I'll probably try some others.  Besides really
liking the taste, I stick with the CC for two reasons.  First, I've
never had a complaint about the smell from smokers or non-smokers.
Second, back when I did experiment with various flavors, if I found one
I didn't like it seemed like it took forever to get my pipe to forget
it.  I've tried to find good CC locally, but I finally gave up, and now
I just send off to Boston for it.

Patience, friend.  Try putting less tobacco in the bowl and packing it a
little looser.  To fill a pipe, I was taught to loosely fill the bowl
and pack lightly, then loosely fill the bowl again and pack medium, then
loosely fill the bowl one more time and pack firmly.  This gives a nice
firm pack but leaves air space down at the bottom.  To break in a new
pipe, just do the first two steps.  In my experience, if you use less
tobacco and pack it less firmly, you'll get down to the bottom of the
pipe more quickly with less moisture.  Be careful not to let it burn too
hot though.  Another thing to try is to gently dig up and stir the
bottom when it won't light and try again.

^recreational smoking, such as cigars and gourmet ciggarettes?

Gee, I wish I didn't like cigarettes so much.  To keep myself from
smoking them, I only smoke one brand, John Player Specials (not to be
confused with Phillip Morris's Players, or Player Rough Cuts) and
they're not available in the US.

Back when I was in  college, we got some Balkan Sobranie cigarette
tobacco and hand rolled some cigarettes that were marvelous.  I haven't
seen the cigarette tobacco since.  Anybody seen it lately?

&gt;So, to that end, antismoking rhetoric will be /dev/nulled, and flames
&gt;are to be used only for the purpose of lighting up. 'Nuff said?

This is sort of anti-pipe, but I got a kick out of it, and what the
hell: we're all friends here, right?  I was watching the show Night
Court, and there was a blind man walking around the commissary talking
about how his other senses were more acute to compensate for his
blindness.  "For instance," he said, "I can tell that there are four
people sitting at this table.  Two of you are having tea, one of you is
having coffee, and..." he takes a sniff as he walks toward John
Laraquette who is rather vigorously lighting his pipe "...one of you is
cremating a cat."

Martin, I had the same problem for many years. But recently a light appeared
at the end of the tunnel (no politics :-) ). My personal problem was that I
didn't smoke the whole tobacco in the bowl. In the book of Richard Hacker
(Steve, please repost my message about the book), he indicates that a bowl
of tobacco should be smoked untill the last possible puff, because the pipe
tobacco doesn't loose its flavour, like others do. He also suggests that a
fine coating of honey on the inside of the bowl helps the development of a
uniform cake on new pipes. I suggest that you trim your uneven cakes, using
a pipe rimmer, and rub a 'very thin' coating of honey around the inside of
the bowl, covering the heels and side walls.  I did this with my older pipes
and worked just fine. If you never trimmed your pipe bowls before, let me
know. I did many times and could help with some hints.

Good luck !

that your hard-working moderator is less than totally diligent. It's
true, just don't let it be said! :-9 If this isn't the letter you
meant, let me know and I'll try to dig it out of my mailbox. -S.]

    About the Hacker's book, I bought it in Lake Placid. They have an
excellent pipe shop called 'With Pipes and Books'. It is worthy to
spend a weekend in Lake Placid just to visit the shop, and of course,
buy a new pipe. Besides the Adirondack region is really beautiful. I
have the address at home and will send you later on a separate
message. I am sure you can mail order it from them. I truly recommend
the book. It is fun reading, and full of valuable information about
pipe smoking. From the book I got the address of Peter Dunn who runs
the Cotterie of Pipe Smokers and is the editor of the Ephemeris. I
sent him a letter and he sent me a copy of the Ephemeris. I will send
his address along with the pipe shop in Lake Placid.

[Both the book and the shop sound worthwhile. Do others have tales of
their favorite tobacco shops? (I've been looking for a good one in
central NJ, without much luck so far.) -S.]

Hi! I thought I'd start off by passing some addresses to you:

	Tom Dunn
	The Universal Coterie of Pipe Smokers
	20-37 120th St.
	College Point, NY 11356

Tom puts out a witty and informative newsletter called "The Pipe
Smoker's Ephemeris" on an irregular basis, and in general acts as a
focal point for pipe smokers, Sherlockians, hobbits, and others of
similar persuasion. The newsletter is free (he sent it to me for
years, no questions asked!), but a donation would be nice. TPSE/TUCOPS
is the largest and most worthwhile group of pipe aficionados I know.

	International Association of Pipe Smokers' Clubs
	17 Midline Road
	Ballston Lake, NY 12019

Honestly, I don't know how active the IAPSC is; I tried to contact
the local chapter for Philadelphia while I lived there, and never got
an answer. You may have better luck, though; it's worth a stamp.

	Pipe Collectors International, Inc.
	6172 Airways Blvd.
	Box 22085
	Chattanooga, TN 37422

I have just learned of this group, and wrote to them last week; I'll
let you know the results. Also look for a mini-review of one of the
popular tobacco blends, as soon as I decide on one (probably by
stochastic processes, aka random guess :-9

Smoke in peace,

Steve, please edit this and send it across the mailing list.  Thanks!

Hi there, everybody.  I just got my first pipe (an English "rum
cake"), and so far the only tobacco I've smoked has been "Mystique",
which I believe is the tobacconist's own blend.  Could anyone post or
e-mail to me the names of several mild, sweet tobaccos that would be
available in a pipe shop?  I'm still new at this and don't know where
to start.  Thanks.

[Personally, I like non-aromatic tobaccos the best, but I might
mention a couple of suggestions. When I started smoking, I used
Amphora Mild Aromatic, a cavendish mixture. It _is_ mild, as long as
you smoke slowly, but most tobaccos don't stay mild if you're puffing
furiously!  You might also check out Captain Black or Borkum Riff,
which are both strongly aromatic. Someone mentioned Cherry Cavendish
(not sure if this is the brand name!) a while back, too.

By the way, congratulations on your new pipe! Hope you both become
good friends. -S.]

Status: R


Dear pipe smokers fellows:

After smoking a bowl of Dunhill Night Cap in a recently acquired italian pipe,
there was nothing left for me to do except to sit by the terminal and give a
small contribution to our mailgroup.

In a recent mail exchange with Steve, and after noticing the interest of some
of the members of the group about different types of tobaccos and their
properties, I am sending a brief glossary of the most common types of tobaccos
available. Most of the information was taken from the book of Richard Hacker,
The Ultimate Pipe Book, but I'll try to give my own impressions about the
tobaccos I've tried myself.

Virginia: grown mostly in North and South Carolina (not in Virginia as one
might expect), it is a commonly bright yellow tobacco, being that the reason
why they are referred to as 'Bright', although dark Virginia does exist.
Bright Virginia has a pleasantly sweet, woodsy taste, making it very popular
in blended tobaccos. Used in moderation provides a superb flavor to almost any
blend. Be careful, though, for too much Virginia will tend to burn 'hot'. I
know of two blends of pure Virginia: one is the Dunhill Virginia blend, which
is more of an English oriented taste, for obvious reasons (it is a Dunhill),
and the other is the MacBaren Virginia #1, which I just bought a tin can last
week. It is a long matured tobacco, with a very distinctive and original
taste.

Burley:  
light yellowish green to yellow-brown in color, it is a extremely light
tobacco. It has almost no taste itself, but absorbs the flavorings added to
aromatic tobacco. Very popular for that reason. MacBaren has a blend called
Burley; I haven't tried, but will soon.

Latakia: grown in northern Syria, this oriental tobacco is usually very
expensive. It is dark brown, almost black in color.  Latakia produces a very
rich, heavy taste, and is usually found in most quality English mixtures
(which I favor unconditionally). I usually buy pure Latakia to mix with other
tobaccos, like Half-and-Half, which is half Virginia and half Burley. I liked
the mixture and hope that some pipe smokers fellows will try it too.

Perique: 
very rare, slow burning, strong-tasting, it is only grown in a small area of
Louisiana. It is the opposite of Burley. Should never be smoked by itself, or
we will probably loose one member of our mailgroup. When mixed with skills, it
produces a very distinctive taste. Dunhill has one mixture called 'Elizabethan
Mixture', which contains a bit of perique. I've tried it and encourage those
who like English mixtures, or those willing to try, to do so.

Maryland:
grown in Maryland, it is of rich brown color, and is used with the same
purpose as of Burley. I never tried this kind of tobacco. If someone did,
please let us know about it.

Turkish:
it is a broad classification of a variety of tobaccos that are actually grown
in Greece. It is of good quality and burns evenly.  They are rarely used in
pipes, but can be found in some of the more exotic blends. I once bought a
blend called Turkish from a store in Boston at Harvard square (I forgot the
name, but it is a quite famous pipe store), and really enjoyed it.  I think I
will have to plan a trip to Boston to get more of that superb blend.

Cavendish: a generic term for tobacco that have been flavored with some kind
of external flavor, such as sugar, maple or rum, and then heated and pressed
in recurring cycles. There are a dozen different types of Cavendish. I don't
know much about the history of Cavendish, but (please correct me if I'm
wrong), Cavendish was an English admiral that during his trips used to mix his
tobacco with rum in the ship.  The best Cavendish in my opinion is the dutch
blend Amphora red pouch (there is also blue and green cans and pouch). I have
tried a number of different Cavendish, but lately I've been favoring English
blends.

Well, I hope that this will help some of our pipe smokers fellows in the
group. I have been smoking pipe for over 7 years and the suggestion I have as
long as tobacco is concerned is: try them. This is the best way of really
knowing about them. And if you don't like one particular blend, try it again
years from now. You might be surprise.

Have all a pleasant and peaceful smoke. (with good tobacco, of course)

If anyone here is near Princeton, I'd recommend that you stop in at John
David, Ltd. in the Quakerbridge Mall. It's not just a run-of-the-mall
smokeshop; John and his son know their tobacco (which I admit I'm a bit
ignorant about, but people like Elias and Bill are educating me!) and are
almost embarrasingly helpful. 

John turned me on to African, which he had used as the major component of an
English blend. (I think there was also some Virginia and just a small shade
of Latakia.) African has a "naturally sweet" taste - I didn't know what that
meant, and asked. Later, as I was walking around the mall puffing away on my
full-bent Peterson, I discovered that there was a sweet taste to the smoke;
not overpowering, but present. Quite nice, after some of the heavy blends
I'd been smoking for the past couple of weeks. (I also noticed that I was
being "given the eye" by some rather attractive young ladies, which was also
pleasant! Perhaps many women still do enjoy the smell of a pipe. :-9

Also this week, I got a reply from Pipe Collectors International, and sent
away for a year's subscription. They publish a bimonthly tabloid newsletter,
and sponsor a convention and some local swap meets. The $15/year they charge
certainly seems reasonable; I'll let you know how the newsletter is, and
post their cover letter in a later Pipes Digest. Until next time, then,

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

In Digest #6, Elias Mazur gives an excellent rundown of various sorts
of tobaccos:

&gt;Burley:  
&gt;light yellowish green to yellow-brown in color, it is a extremely light
&gt;tobacco. It has almost no taste itself, but absorbs the flavorings added to
&gt;aromatic tobacco. Very popular for that reason. 

I take it, then, that most Cavendishes are Burley ?

&gt;Latakia: grown in northern Syria, this oriental tobacco is usually very
&gt;expensive. It is dark brown, almost black in color.  Latakia produces a very
&gt;rich, heavy taste, and is usually found in most quality English mixtures
&gt;(which I favor unconditionally). I usually buy pure Latakia to mix with other
&gt;tobaccos, like Half-and-Half, which is half Virginia and half Burley. I liked
&gt;the mixture and hope that some pipe smokers fellows will try it too.

Latakia also produces a rather, er, um, "distinctive" aroma. 8-)  (I'm
politely trying to say "It stinks !" 8-)

Which brings up an issue: how important is the aroma of a tobacco to you ?
I can't really smell the tobacco when I'm smoking it, anyway, though I
would presume the aroma figures into the taste, somewhat.  If I put down
the pipe and leave the room, and return in a few minutes, though, I can
get a whiff.

I place a lot of emphasis on aroma, though, because I don't want to offend
others, particularly non-smokers.  Back in the before-time, when you could
actually walk around a store while smoking, I received more compliments
than complaints by a factor of at least 3:1.  People who won't tolerate
cigar or cigarette smoke will often be glad to let you smoke a pipe; *if*
it doesn't smell like you're burning field mice.  Of course, my job is made
easier in that I really enjoy vanilla cavendishes, while finding English-
style tobaccoes much less pleasant.   I must confess, though, to never
having tried Latakia; actually, I might, now that I'm living alone 8-)

I would suspect those with families are even more concerned about this.

[Nowwaitaminute! I _like_ Latakia! It wasn't even an acquired taste; I liked
it the first time I smoked it. Even if it does smell like incinerated
rodents and induce the neighbors to call the Fire Department. :-9  -S.]

<a name="3">Subject: a new smoking experience</a>

I've just had a unique smoking experience, mango cavendish.
Yes, mango, that ever popular tropical fruit.  I wasn't to supprised at
the taste, considering that it was recommended by my tobaconist, but I
was suprised at its existence.  Pat (proprieter of Jon's Pipe Shop, 
Champaign Illinois) studied under a real master of the craft who specialized
in exotic cavendish's.  Pat still buys from that company today, but with
its late owner's death, the quality has declined somewhat.  The mango
was one of his last products.  Its cut down with something else (probably
vanilla cavendish), and is somewhat lighter than black cavendish, but
not by much.  The taste is delicious, somewhat tart, subtly fruity,
sweet without being cloying.  The experience was the closest I've had
with a flavored tobacco to actually eating the genuine article, it had
the same lightness of taste yet solidity of substance that a real mango
has.

[This sounded so tasty that I wrote to Ami and got Pat's address; he's
sending me some of the mango by mail. I'll let you know how it is. -S.]

<a name="1">Subject: The arrival of the mango</a>

The mango cavendish arrived last week, and I've been smoking it on and
off for about a week. Pat, the proprietor of the pipe shop, didn't
seem in the least surprised to be getting letters from strangers a
thousand miles away asking for strange blends. In fact, he sent me a
rather nice letter on his blending beliefs (which reminds me, I gotta
pay him!! :-9

In any case, the mango cavendish has a pleasant aroma and does,
indeed, taste like a real mango. Because it's cavendish, it burns a
little hot (at least I find that cavendish usually smokes hot). It's
also probably best to smoke this in the first pipe of the day, when
your palate is clear.

Also this week, I found myself with some tobacco and without a pipe,
so I invested in a corncob to keep in the car. The first smoke was,
surprisingly, quite hot! So here's a question: who knows about the
care and feeding of corncobs? Will they always smoke hot?

I hope to hear from y'all soon. Until next time, smoke in peace.

~\U Steve.

I have a new topic, matches.  What are your favorite matches for pipe
smoking?  I prefer Swan Vestas, they are nice wooden matches which end
up costing about 25 cents for a box of 50.  The proper match is very
importants.

<a name="3">Subject: New (old) pipes.</a>

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

     I`m happy to share with you the acquisition of 2 pipes for my collection.
One is a brand new italian pipe from the same pipe maker I got a pipe about 2
months ago. His name is Aldo Velani, and the pipe is really beautiful. It is a
large full bent with a nice straight grain. It was given to me as a birthday
gift by my girlfriend (of course I chose it :-). The other is my first
pre-owned pipe. Is is a Barling made in Denmark by Ole Larsen, from the
transition period of the Barling history. It is straight stem, with mixed
grains. It smokes so cool and smooth, that I could not believe. Maybe that's
the biggest advantage of buying pre-owned pipes: they are great to smoke,
given the wood is old and dry.

    Well, now I'll sit down and smoke one of them (hard decision :-). I'm
preparing a summary of types of grains in pipes, and what we should look for
when buying a new pipe. It will be here soon.

    Smoke in peace. ~\U

    Elias Mazur.

I don't know any trick for tightening stems, but I can suggest that you
contact a good pipe store owner, who can fix your stems, or even put on a new
one. I know of a pipe shop in Utica (I mentioned in previous mails), whose
owner, Mr Bob Smith, is an expert on the subject. He has a large quantity of
new stems, and the know-how. Every time I go to his pipe shop, I take a pipe
with me, so that he can clean the stem. It looks like new !  Anyway, I'm going
to pass you his address and phone number, and you can contact him. I'm sure
you'll be pleased to do business with him.

&gt;Based on the news from this group I have tried a more English style

&gt;When I know I will make a better statement,  but so far I am enjoying it
&gt;more than the sweetened brands.

Deja vu !  Just yesterday, I went to the TB (the only pipe store in
East Columbus open on Sundays...) to try some latakia.  I turned my
nose up at Sherlock's, and picked Connoisseur, which sits right next
to it.

I got two ounces and promised myself not to make a decision until I'd
smoked it all  (to make sure the my pipe cake picks up the full flavor,
after years of smoking flavored cavendish), but my initial impression is
underwhelming.  There is a certain plain, woodsy flavor, which is
pleasant, but that's offset by the smell, which is certainly no crowd
pleaser.  We'll give it a while, yet.

You need to sand down the stem a little, then it should fit fine.  If not,
sand off a little more.

Some stems are too far gone to be recovered, I'm told, so you may find
after a few sandings that the stem literally falls out of the pipe.  In
that case, you'll need a replacment stem.

8-)  8-)   sorry, couldn't resist.

A couple of my hard rubber stems, and one lucite, did the same thing,
giving me to presume that the pipe itself has expanded, as opposed to
the stem loosening.  Anyway, my quick fix (which has been in place for
a year or two now 8-)  was to wrap a small bit of thin paper around the
tip of the stem, to act as a shim.  Experiment with the exact thickness you
need, but one turn is usually sufficient.  Scotch tape works even better,
so long as you carfully clean the stem first.

My greatest pipe repair to date was on a favorite old deep bend (the sort
that bumps your chin as you smoke).  Managed to drop this one, splitting
the pipe neck in half and breaking off the top half:


	-----------
       /           \    /\
      |            |   / x\
      |            |  xxx  /
      |            \_/    /
      \                  /
        \_______________/
where everyinging above and to the left of the x's was broken off.  As the
pipe was a fine smoker, I refused to give up so easily.   I put the too
half back in place (it fitted perfectly, no chips were lost), and
tightly wound that broken area of the neck with wire.  Then, I placed
a bit of heat-shrink tubing over the wire wrap, and with a heat gun,
shrunk it tightly into place.

Sure, it looks funny, but by God, it's held up for over 2 years now !

<a name="2">Subject: Tightening a stem.</a>

When I first started smoking a pipe I was  fortunate  to  find  a
person  in a pipe shop who helped me a great deal and would spend
a lot of time answering my questions.  As much as  "Phil  of  the
Bay  Area"  hates malls, the Bruyere Shoppe at the local mall was
the best store going.  Anyway, back to the  reason  for  posting.
As  a  newcommer  to pipe smoking I tended to smoke the pipe fast
and hot (still do sometimes, but I'm  working  on  it)  and  this
would  cause the shank to expand compressing the stem.  If it did
not crack the shank eventually, the stem  would  get  loose.  The
gentleman  that  I  spoke  of  showed me how to fix this with the
statement, "The first time I'll show you  for  free,  after  that
there  is  a  charge".  This  works  for  the  vulcanized, black,
bowling ball style stems, I don't know about the acrylic.

What he did was to cram as many pipe cleaners into  the  stem  as
would  fit.  Usually  two,  but  I've found that three are needed
sometimes and in other stems only one.  Once  the  pipe  cleaners
are  in  place  and positioned so that they are right against the
opening in the tenon, you take a match or lighter and heat up the
tenon.  This makes the tenon soft.  Be sure not to hold the flame
so that it touches the stem as this might start the stem burning.

When the tenon of the stem is hot  and  becomes  soft,  push  the
tenon  against  the  side of a counter or another flat surface at
the same time keeping the tenon as perpendicular to  the  surface
as  possible.  This  will cause the tenon to bulge just a little,
the pipe cleaners keep the hole open.  As you use this  technique
often, you learn just how much pressure you  can  use  to  get  a
tight fit without giving up much tenon length.  When the stem has
cooled so that it is no longer soft, remove the pipe cleaners and
sand  the tenon down, a little at a time, checking the fit to the
pipe.  To sand, wrap the sandpaper (about 120  grit)  around  the
tenon and turn the stem so that you are removing material  evenly
around  the  tenon.  When  the  tenon  just  fits into the shank,
remove it and cover the tenon surface with  graphite  by  rubbing
with  pencil  lead (this allows the tenon to slide into the shank
easier).

You can do this three or four times, and then it is time to buy a
new stem.

<a name="3">Subject: Cobs and Clays</a>

As several folks have pointed out, corncob and clay pipes are entertaining
bargains.  Both of them start out porous enough that they need little or
no breakin, both are light and easy to carry, both are easy to break or
char, and both are cheap enough so you don't care.

I find the cobs best for pocket pipes to smoke at outdoor sports, on safe spots
on trails (e. g. big rocks), and general casual al fresco adventures.  I
haven't had a clay for a long time and would probably reserve one for St.
Paddy's day.

(Other excellent outdoor smokes include Connecticutt Valley cigars. These
are all-tobacco with fine wrappers and a fairly heavy taste. Judges Cave
is one brand.  I tend to think of them as "cigars ordinaire", the rolled
equivalent of a decent jug red.)

Re: With Pipe and Book

I've received a few back issues of "The Pipe Smoker's Ephemeris" from
Tom Dunn, one of which mentioned a store in Lake Placid, NY called,
"With Pipe and Book." They carry a variety of pipe books, including
some which are rather difficult to find, and which I've wished for for
years (Carl Ehwa's book on pipes and tobaccos, Ben Rappaport's book on
collecting, several Dunhill books, and about 50 or 60 more!) Their
address, for those who are also curious, is:

	With Pipe and Book
	Breck &amp; Julia Turner, Proprietors
	91 Main St.
	Lake Placid, NY 12946

The store's name comes from a poem which they print in their pamphlet,
and which I quote here, for those who hack at close of day.

With Pipe and Book at close of day,
Oh what is sweeter, mortal, say?
It matters not what book on knee,
Old Izaak or the Odyssey,
It matters not meerschaum or clay.

And though one's eyes will dream astray,
And lips forget to sue or sway,
It is "enough to merely be"
	With Pipe and Book.

What though our modern skies be gray,
As bards aver, I will not pray
For "soothing Death" to succor me,
But ask this much, O Fate, of thee,
A little longer yet to stay
	With Pipe and Book.

<a name="1">Subject: Reviving Old Tobacco</a>

A few days ago, thinking I'd run out of my usual tobacco (the Tinder Box's
"Sherlock's Choice" blend, a terrible name for a delightful smoke), I 
opened the jar where I keep the dog-ends of tobaccos I've either lost
interest in or simply didn't like.  In the jar I found some Sir Walter
Raleigh, some Prince Albert (yes, in a can), and a couple of other
Tinder Box blends, Skilling and Philosopher, both 7-10 years old and
DRY, but offering more promise than their drug store alternatives.

The Skilling bag contained just enough to recharge my pouch, and the
Philosopher bag rather more.  So, I moistened a humidifier button with
Cognac, and dropped it in the pouch with the Skilling.  I'd never
previously tried anything but water as a humidifier, but I was amazed
by the results -- that ancient tobacco is actually very good, now!

Have I stumbled on something that pipe smokers have known for years?

Puffers wishing to try a range of British-style tobaccoes might try the ones
sold under the "Rattray's" brand. (They're actually Scottish.  No offense
meant to anyone involved in _that_ eternal debate. :-))

They range from very heavy, almost chewy-tasting, Latakia-loaded
blends (Rattray's Black Mallory) to tasty midweights (Rattray's
Red Rapparee) to plain Virginia blends (No. 7;  Accountant's Mixture).

My favorites are the No. 7 and the Red Rapparee, which I may be spelling
wrong.  It's fun telling people I'm smoking "Rrrratrray's Rrrred
Rrrrapparrree," too.  The Accountant's mixture is good, too, but
almost like smoking "Lawyer's Mixture" as far as name appeal goes. :-)

[Aside on aromatics: On tobacco choices, of course, chacun a son gout
asolutement.  But whenever I smoke a heavily dosed aromatic, I think
of the high school chemistry demo where the teacher burns sugar by
pouring acid on it, releasing great clouds of steam and piles of
graphite.  I keep imagining that's what's going on in my pipe.

On the other hand, smoking Latakia blends is often a solitary 
pleasure. De gustibus, to drag in yet another language.]

Dear Pipefriends,

This week is a rather signifigant one in a few ways! First, I've finished
all the things one must endure to extract a Master's in computer science
from the State University of New Jersey (a place with many things to be
circumspect about, but which did NOT incorrectly verify cold fusion!) Which
leads to a question: would you have any recommendations on a "reward pipe"
for making it all the way through? I've got somewhere in the neighborhood of
$50 to play with, though I'm not bound to this amount.

More importantly here, I'm very relieved about one thing. I'm about to lose
a roommate whose first reaction when I lit my pipe was to whine, "Are you
*smoking*?" Thereafter, he sprayed the hall with ozone-depleting chemicals
each time I lit up, regardless of how careful I was that my smoke did not
impinge upon his twitching nostrils. I shan't mourn his passing, for this
and other reasons. (Fellow hedonists, have you any advice on how to deal
with similar ninnies in the future? I'm [ugh] sure I'll need it.)

The top story in the pipe news: I've received four books from "With Pipe and
Book", a tobacconist and book dealer in upstate New York on which Elias and
I have both commented. One of the books I purchased is, of course, Richard
Hacker's "Ultimate Pipe Book", a witty and informative tome well worth the
$18.95 or so. I wrote Mr.  Hacker directly, by the way, and was informed
that there will be a new edition, fully revised, appearing in September.
Those who are in need of Christmas presents might take note!

Also in the box from Lake Placid were Carl Ehwa's "Book of Pipes and
Tobaccos" and Ben Rappaport's "Complete Guide to Collecting Antique Pipes."
I haven't had time to completely absorb either of these volumes yet, but
rest assured I shall. Ehwa's book has an excellent section on tobacco
culture.

Last is Mary Dunhill's "Our Family Business", her insider's view of the
Dunhill firm and how its founding family built it. The book is candid in the
extreme about the Dunhills' family life, which at times appears to have been
most unhappy; not too much hard information on pipe crafting or the modern
firm's operations. A worthwhile read, though I'd recommend against buying it
outright.

A note to the Bay Area and New England members! "The Ultimate Pipe Book"
lists a couple of pipe-related restaurants:

- Pipe Dream Restaurant
  Rte. 32 and Ademac Rd.
  W. Willington, Ct. 06729
  "Their briar-inspired desserts will light-up your tastebuds."
  [Briar-inspired desserts??? -S.]

- S. Holmes, Esq.
  "221B Baker Street"
  Holiday Inn, Union Square
  Sutter at Powell Streets
  San Francisco, CA
  "A lifesized diorama of Holmes' sitting room and individually reserved
  calabashes for regular patrons make this drinking saloon a Sherlockian's
  delight."

(Keen's English Chop House in NYC used to operate on a similar principle -
they reserved a clay pipe for all their regulars. News from the New York
Pipe Club (Sailorman Jack, 212-288-3832) is that they don't allow smoking in
their dining room! :-( But if anyone can check out the "Pipe Dream" or
"221B", the group would greatly appreciate the effort, I'm sure!)

Well, that's about it for this time. Please write in if you've any wisdom to
share, and until next time, may your bowls be dry and your smoke rings round.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Well, I've heard of people using chunks cut from apples as humidifier
buttons;  I was told that neither this nor potatos was a good idea, 
though; they tend to mold quickly, and take your tobacco with them,
I guess.

But cognac ?   I can understand flavoring tobacco with an aromatic
alcohol, but does it have to be *French* ?  8-)

I've had several bizarre roommates in this regard.  For example, when I was
living in the dorms, I requested a "smoking" room (the OSU Residence and
Dining halls tried to accommodate smoking/non-smoking preferences), but
ended up with one roommate who didn't smoke and, in fact, really disliked 
the smell of smoke  (and I only smoked nicely aromatic stuff, too).  I
gather that some people just can't stand tobacco aroma, regardless of
flavoring.  We compromised;  I kept smoking, and he put up with it. 8-)
I never felt guilty, either;  in exchange, I didn't complain about
*his* smoking (of a certain, er, "hard-to-find" tobacco substitute).  I
did once comment to him that his grass would probably smoke smoother if
he kept it in a humidor... 8-)


After that, I moved in with roommates who I'd checked before and liked the
smell of my pipe.  We actually had a quasi-smoking policy;  my pipe was
OK, but no cigarettes allowed.


Finally, I moved in with a friend I'd known for years.   A week after
moving in, he made the comment that he like me more than he disliked my
pipe, but would I please not smoke in the living room ?  Grrr...  I
did avoid it, to an extent, but if I had a lit pipe and needed to go there,
I didn't worry about it.

Some people are funny that way.  One friend told me after several years
that my smoking gave him headaches;  if he'd told me in the first place, 
I'd have gladly not smoked around him.  When it used to be possible to
walk through a store with a lit pipe, three times as many people used to
compliment me on the smell of my pipe as would complain about it;  of
course, that doesn't count the people who stand upwind from you at a 
bus stop and make those silly little coughing noises 8-)

Congratulations, Steve!!

You might consider buying a "Brebbia" brand pipe.  These are Italian jobbies,
and apparently very popular and respected over there.  They're at about the
same quality level as Bari pipes, which is to say very good.  But they've
been widely distributed (at least around here) for only the last year or so,
they don't have a famous name yet, and you could probably find a decent one
in your price rance.

They have some interesting shapes, to me anyway. They tend to alter traditional
contours just enough to add interest without being gaudy.  Their trademark is
a diagonal slash of briar on the stem -- quite nice.

Remember that most manufacturers sell different "quality ranges" of pipes.
They often don't know which range a pipe will be in until it's finished --
the last stroke of sandpaper on a bowl can reveal a damaging flaw.

So the same production line will yield a perfect pipe with fine grain ($200),
one with good grain and a few nicks ($100), and one with one or more filled-in
flaws ($50).  It's clear where the cost-effective end of this curve is.

Pipes that don't turn out well at all are often sold under lesser names.
Ehrlich's in Boston used to have big bins of "Boston Briars" for a
dollar or two.  These were factory seconds of who knows what and were
great deals. I still have a couple.

Anent Martin Lodahl's experience: one great thing about tobacco is that is
just doesn't spoil (outside freaky cases, like mildew).  Old weed can 
almost always be resuscitated by a few hours or days in a humid environment.
I've never tried wakening up the flavor with booze but it sounds great.
Cigars with the puffing end dipped in Remy Martin --- yum!

[Cigar aside -- old cigars get crumbly.  If a cigar in a store makes
crackly noises as you roll it gently between your fingers, don't buy
it.  If one you've already bought does, take it _out_ of the cellophane
and leave it in your humididor for a few days.  It will be fine.]

A big, maduro Partagas sounds like a great present for oneself, too.

Thanks for the help, Bill and Phil! (To answer Bill's question, I'm going
for a Ph.D [Ph.Ool. though I may be!])

Last week, I did a little exploring of the tobacco shops in North Jersey,
and got some good news after a fairly long trek. 

I first checked out "Mr. Pipe" at Woodbridge Plaza. Not too impressive. It's
a small mall pipe store which seems to be in business mostly to sell
cigarettes and lottery tickets (a common practice among local smokeshops).
They haven't paid much attention to making a fussy, dallying pipe shopper
(such as myself) feel at home. They had some quality pipes for sale, but
these were mostly either far behind the counter or in a display case in
front of the cash register, where I seemed sure to be trampled by
lottery-ticket buyers. I didn't stay long.

The next day I went to "John David" in Quaker Bridge Mall, a store I've
described here before. The owner was attentive, but his stock seemed devoid
of middle-of-the-line pipes (I wanted one without fills, though I was willing
to tolerate some surface defects) and didn't seem to digress beyond basic
shapes I already had. Conversation:

ME:	Do you have any freehands?
OWNER:	Well, _all_ our pipes are freehands, except for maybe the cheap
	ones which are made by machine. This Dunhill is a freehand, this
	Upshall is a freehand... But for fifty bucks, you're not going to
	get a freehand pipe without fills.
ME:	I meant Danish freehands.
OWNER:	Oh, you're looking for something _wild_. I don't have any Danish
	freehands on hand; they don't sell. But I can order one. Here, let
	me show you the catalog. (Shows me a picture of a spectacularly 
	garish Preben Holm.) 
ME:	That's a bit _too_ wild for me.
OWNER:	Well, there are some Petersons over here. Petersons are always a
	good buy. [I agree, but...]
ME:	But I already have two Petersons. I don't need another one.
OWNER:	Not wild enough? Okay, but believe me, for fifty bucks you're not
	going to get a pipe without fills.
ME:	(Suddenly realizing that he was, after all, operating his shop in
	close proximity to Princeton) I'll just look on my own.

Nothing particularly caught my eye there, so I moved on.

The last place I visited was, of course, where I hit the jackpot.  Oddly
enough, this was a "Tinder Box" recently moved from Brunswick Square Mall to
a storefront on Route 18. The move, IMHO, was the kiss of death - no foot
traffic, difficult to see the store from the road, even harder to get into
or out of the parking lot, and no lottery concession for months! Rush hour
was already pressing at 4 P.M., but I decided to chance a visit.

The attendant (a youth who didn't appear too savvy about pipes - he asked me
if I was interested in a "messerschaum") immediately offered me a 50 percent
discount on any pipe on the shelf. I decided to taste (or at least observe)
his wares, and spent about half an hour having him move pipes into and out
of his display case. (His setup was like "Mr. Pipe", but I was the only
customer in the store while I was there.) I finally narrowed my selection
down to an Italian "Mauro Armellini" quarter-bent cone with a spherical top
(something like a briar Calabash) and a Danish "Bjarne" full-bent pot with a
narrow mouth on the bowl. Both had bite-proof Lucite stems; although I saw
some diminishingly small sand pits and crevices, neither had any apparent
fills. The total price with the discount was $87.50, but the youth offered
them both for $75, no tax, and with some tobacco thrown in! I accepted, and
received a double reward and a pouch of "Sherlock's." I'd heartily recommend
that New Jersey smokers check this place out - before they get the lotto
machine!

After about three pipefuls, the "Armellini" and I are good friends. (And how
nice to be able to smoke at home, without "Felix Unger" and his spraycan! :-)
The "Bjarne" remains unsmoked; perhaps I'll open a good book and get
acquainted with her tonight. One of these days I'll go procure a Partagas,
though I'm not a frequent cigar smoker. 

Until next time, pipefriends,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Well, aren't you ?   Most people would kill for one !

The youth of today may have forgotten that time in 1940, the Blitz,
when the dreaded Messerchaums ruled the skies over Britain.  These
deadly German fighter pipes were the scourge of the Royal Pipe Force,
and left ashes wherever they went.   The Germans had something of a
technological advantage, of course; fueled by high-octane Turkish tobaccos,
the Messerschaums smoked faster than the more traditional English Spitfires,
and packed a tremendous bite; as a drawback, this fuel made the Messer's
easier to light.

Of course, the tides were finally turned by the arrival of the Americans;
our Pipe-38 (Lighter) , P-47 (Thunderburl), and P-51 (Mouthsting)
were more than a match for for anything the Germans could carve.  The few
remaining Messerschaums are real collectors' items, though I've heard
they're difficult to smoke in a tailwind.

<a name="3">Subject: Messerschaums</a>

In the last Pipes Digest, someone noted that the clerk at a local Tinder
Box offered to sell him a "messerschaum."  I'm astounded that any
pipe afficianado would turn one down !

Maybe kids today are too young to remember back to those frightening days
of 1940, when the dreaded Messerschaums ruled the skies over Britain. A
failing of our educational system, no doubt...

For those unfamiliar, the Messerschaum was Germany's premier fighting pipe
in the early years of WWII.  Its light construction and excellent cooling
properties enabled it to smoke high-octane Turkish tobaccos, which
generally burned too hot for the more conventional English briars.  The
result was a fast-smoking pipe, highly maneuverable, but dangerously easy
to light.  Despite the latter failing, it was clearly superior to the older
British fighting pipes.

The only possible English counter was to increase the Latakia content
of their tobaccos, and to smoke these high-test mixtures in the aptly-named
Spitfire which, while nearly the equal of the German pipe, was extremely
uncomfortable to smoke; pilots had to have periodic time off to recover
from 3rd degree tongue burns.  Doggedly, though, the Royal Aromatics Force
fought off the Pipewaffe, until America's entry into the war added
thousands of modern pipes to the British arsenal.  The Germans were finally
beaten when the bombing of the Rumanian tobacco fields near Ploesti
deprived them of their powerful fuel, forcing them to use lower grades
of homegrown, poorly aged and blended.o

Truly, though, that  dark time, when Britain alone stood in the face of
the Nazi blitz, was British smokers' Finest Hour.

Well, I did, anyway - "Bean's Mixture", from L. L. Bean himself! In fact,
for a long time this was my favorite smoke. Bean's no longer sells it, and I
have only a small sample left. I heard somewhere (here? the Ephemeris?)
about a tobacconist who can duplicate any blend, given a sample; I'll have
to get on the stick and re-locate this shop.

In general, though, I'd tend to prefer natural or light-aromatic tobacco.
Scanning through "The Ultimate Pipe Book", a mixture of Virginia (for
flavor) and long-cut Burley and/or Maryland might be nice. Perhaps you could
get all three and run an experiment!


		And now for something completely different...


Thanks to Bill for his, as usual, insightful comments on the Messerschaum
fighter pipes. Bill, unfortunately you forgot to mention the Messerschaum
ME-262, the world's first jet pipe. 

The ME-262, produced toward the end of the war, had a top speed of an
astonishing 400 bowls per hour and could blow rings around any fighter pipe
then on the Allies' drawing boards. Due to the high G(unk) loads, pilots of
the ME-262 had to tape their tongues to keep from blacking out in the fierce
fire of battle. The ME-262 had nothing to fear from Allied fighterpipes;
dozens of American B-29 Smokerfortress bomber pipes never made it back to
their home racks when they encountered the Messerschaum jets.

Fortunately for the Allies, Nazi dictator Adolph Bitler decreed that the
ME-262 would be used as a bomber rather than a fighter. The tiny two ounces
of Perique explosive that the Messerschaum jets could carry in their
bomb-bowls was no threat to the Allied Forces. Soon after Bitler's fateful
decision, Allied high-altitude daylight precision smoking stemmed ME-262
production, and shortages of high-nicotine Latakia fuel from Ploesti spelled
its final demise.

Now, really...

From the _Ephemeris_, kind of with permission, a bit about pipe smoking in
the Battle of Britain.

"I flew many missions as wingman to the group commander, Col. Henry Spicer,
a daring pilot with bristling mustaches, who loved to dogfight and could
care less about personal risks. Spicer smoked a big briar pipe, and on the
return home, he always dropped down to below 12,000 feet, unhooked his
oxygen mask, and had himself a smoke. As his wingman, I dropped down with
him right over Paris. German flak guns began pounding at us, but I could see
Spicer in his cockpit tamping his tobacco and lighting his Zippo. We were
practically over the rooftops when the tracers flashed by my canopy. I spoke
into my mike: 'Christ, Colonel Spicer, we're gonna get shot down.' I saw him
chuckle through a cloud of pipe smoke. 'Relax, laddie,' he replied. 'Those
bastards couldn't hit a billboard.' Colonel Spicer was later shot down by a
burst of white flak near the French coast, after he had descended to 12,000
feet to light that damned pipe. He bailed out over the channel, but the
Germans picked him up."

- From _Yeager_, by General Chuck Yeager and Leo Janos.


Also see _Reach for the Sky_ by Paul Brickhill, about Wing Commander Douglas
Bader, the legendary legless British ace. Bader also liked to smoke his pipe
in the cockpit, but had different ideas about what was dangerous - he smoked
while he was on oxygen, a serious fire hazard. Like Spicer, Bader was also
shot down and captured by the Germans (and attempted escape twice, despite
having no legs!) Conclusive proof - pipe smokers have character!


Enough war stories! Please send me something peaceful! Until next time,

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

Well the first pipe has been carved and is almost sanded to a smooth
luster.  It is not like most pipes that I have ever seen.  Since I
do not own a lathe it has straight lines instead of curved.  If you
imagine a cube and cut a small amount from the four corners to make
an uneven octagon you may imagine what this pipe looks like.  I cheated
with this one where the tobacco hole and the shank were already machined
for me.  I have two more completely blank briars awaiting my saw and file.
Does anyone have comments on pipes with straight lines rather than curved?

<a name="3">Subject: Pipe carving; OTJ enjoyment</a>

Thanks for the note, Norm! I've seen pipes with bowls shaped like octagonal
prisms from time to time, but this seems to be a relatively unexplored form
compared to free-form or lathe-made designs. IMHO, there are two basic
requirements for any pipe design: it should be pleasant to smoke and to hold
in the hand (and in the mouth if its bowl is reasonably sized.)  Beyond
that, anything that pleases is OK! (Wish there were a way we could all see
your efforts, Norm!)

Most designs seem to be going for interesting visual forms, but some try for
kinesthetically pleasant pipes (how's that for a $0.65 word!) I have a Ben
Wade "Hand Pipe", which is a large Danish free-form with at least three
comfortable grip positions designed in. Not too good for driving (it's large
and heavy, and I tend to clamp the pipe in my mouth so I have both hands
free for gestures 8-), but very pleasant to smoke when reading or talking.

Sometimes I've wondered why no one gets into making regular polyhedral or
geodesic designs. It would probably take quite a lot of skill with a bandsaw
or sander to do something like that, but I believe you'd get a satisfying
and unusual design if you could do it. Maybe I'll try it when I have access
to a good wood shop.

				---

Second topic: I was wondering how many of the pipefolk on the net are still
allowed to light up on the job? Are there still places where a pipe is OK as
a stimulus to thought? Have you had problems with coworkers, and if so how
have you resolved them? Perhaps there are still places that are tolerant
enough to allow their employees to puff at work (as long as they're not
smoking Buffalo Chip Aromatic!) If you have any tales to tell, good or ill,
please let us know. And tune in next time, same pipe-time, same
pipe-channel!

<a name="2">Subject: Congratulations, help and of course, pipes...</a>

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

   I would like to apologize for not being active in our group for
such a long time.  These past weeks have been pretty busy, and crazy, but
thanks to the peace of mind that my pipes always provide me, I didn't
get any serious stress.  Well, I would like to congratulate my friend
Steve (a little late of course) for the completion of the degree, and
wish him good luck in his persuit for his Ph.D. I'm sure that your new
pipes will help you through those long nights of research and writing the
dissertation. I hope we could all meet and celebrate, with our
favorite pipes along. (Maybe I just planted a seed for the future
meeting of our pipe group. Ideas ???).

I am also finishing my Master's degree, and will be defending my
thesis two weeks from today. Of course I was going to buy myself a new
pipe as the graduation gift 'after' the defense, but yesterday I saw a
beautiful Ben-Wade free-hand with an oustanding straight grain and did
not resist. I bought it, and in a few minutes will be lighting my new
friend for the first time.

My graduation, although something long awaited for, poses a serious
threat on my participation in our pipe group; unlike my friend Steve,
I am not going to continue towards the PhD, and therefore implies that
I have to find a job. I've been looking for a while, but with no
success. Last week I had a couple of interviews, but nothing yet.  The
problem is that if I don't find a job I'll probably go back to Brazil,
which means I won't be able to communicate anymore with the group.
For all these reasons I am asking the group for some help.  If someone
knows of a position for software engineering in the graphics/image
processing field, or any area that requires C programming or
assembler, and would like to have a pipe smoker fellow to puff a nice
bowl of the favorite tobacco with, I would really appreciate any
contacts you might have. Please contact me if you need my resume.


Smoke in peace. ~\U

Elias Mazur.

<a name="3">Subject: Carving</a>

There was an article in Better Homes and Garden's Wood magazine
about a year ago on pipe carving.  From my recollection of the
article the rounded bowls were not made using a lathe, but just
carefully carved in that shape.

The magazine only comes out quarterly, so you ought to be able
to dig up a copy.

<a name="4">Subject: Smoking at Work and Eating Out</a>

I could probably get away with an occasional pipe on the job, but I
don't bother.  I haven't smoked at work for six years or so
and don't miss it.  Since this is balmy Northern California,
I do occasionally nip out to the courtyard with some reading material
and a pipe or cigar.  There's no phone, nobody grouses, and I learn something
or plan something.  This would be less satisfactory, I think, in
Minnesota in January or Houston in August.

I also usually choose to eat in no-smoking sections.
Eating good food, smoking good tobacco, riding my bicycle, and 
having sex are all great pleasures, but some of them don't mix.
Food and tobacco seem to cancel each other's pleasures out.

Smoking between courses is barbaric.
I've never even tried sex on a bicycle.

<a name="5">Subject: Where to Smoke, and Suffering Sphincters</a>

Most of the time I'm pretty polite about not smoking around people who
find it unpleasant.  The only places that are universally OK are my own
turf (house and car), an occasional bar, and outdoors.  At other people's
homes, I'll light up only on the porch or deck unless I'm specifically invited
to smoke indoors.

These policies have for the most part avoided any hassles about when and
where I smoke.  Every so often, though, things get annoying.

Last March, I was waiting for a later plane at the Pheonix airport.  I
had an hour to kill, plenty to read, and a $3 Partagas cigar.  I care-
fully found the designated smoking area, found a chair distant from
most other smokers (I don't care for cigarette smoke, though I'm far from
being a Nazi about it), at lit up.

A party of five or so came up and stood _directly_under_the_"Designated_
Smoking_Section"_sign_.  They were complaining about the temperature, about
the late plane, about this, about that, and about my smoking.  Not directly
to me. You know. Gagging noises, "This SMOKE is AWFUL," and so forth.  These
clowns came to the one area in the entire lobby specifically set aside for
my hobby and started howling.  They could have moved twenty yards in
any direction and found a no-smoking spot.  But they preferred to @#$% and
moan.

I thought of confronting them, but I was in too good a mood.  I leaned back
and puffed harder.  I made smoke rings.  They got madder and went away.

IMHO,it's good for the psyche and the blood pressure to assume that you
will run into three or four (ahem) sphincters a day.  That way when you bump
into one, you just cross him off that day's list.  On good days, you still
have one or two left over.  That was the first time I had worked my way through
my whole day's ration before noon.

<a name="6">Subject: A meeting proposal, and some rejoinders</a>

Elias, congratulations on your new Ben Wade and good luck on your Master's
defense (may the one help the other!) Also, good luck in your search for a
job. I'm sure we all hope you'll be able to stay on the net. Ladies and
gentlemen, if you have some job info for our esteemed founder, please let
him know.  (I will!)

Also, to follow up on Elias's suggestion, I'd like to propose a meeting at
the New York Pipe Club for their next meeting (the first Tuesday in July,
which would be the 4th --- no, that can't be right, I'll have to call.) I'll
let you know the details the next Digest.

Phil's notes about smoking etiquette pretty much parallel my opinions.
Before I went to grad school (when I worked for a living :-), I used to nip
out to the car at lunchtime for a briar and a book. When the car got too
hot, I found a grassy, secluded spot near the plant which was ideal for such
things ( except for some random poison ivy, which I never quite wanted to
try to smoke 8-O ) Not to belabor the point, but the airport scene you
described makes me think that there should be a statement of good manners
for both smokers and nonsmokers. I may concoct one, if someone else hasn't
already written it!

Working at the computer seems like the perfect occasion to smoke, so I often
light up when I'm at home. It helps me to concentrate quite a bit, besides
giving me something to chew on, other than junk food (or a good, meaty
problem!) But that's my own space, and I do without at school or work.

An update on Rick Shoopak's question about summer blends: I just got a
brochure about some blends from Robert McConnell in London. The firm has
been around for 150 years, and are "hand-blended, stem-free, and
glycol-free." They recently became available in the U.S. after some absence.
If you can find a shop that sells them, the "Maduro Superb" and "Special
London Fine Cut" look like what I'd want for a summer smoke - mild, but
tasty. (I'll be looking too!) 

If you'd like to get a copy of McConnell's brochure, send a self-addressed
stamped envelope to:

	W. N. Powers and Co.	(Ref: Summer '87 - Spring '88 _Ephemeris_).
	14026 Leadwell St.
	Van Nuys, CA 91405

Finally, a comment on Phil's note on smoking proximate to eating - it works
both ways, according to Gayl Liebman, also in the last _Ephemeris_. Here's
what she's got to say:

[Regarding a brochure from "Tobacco Express", Box 25773, Lexington, KY 40524]

"... I have also gained insight as well into the role digestion plays on
smoking, proving one is never too old to learn something new. It took the
form of learning which tobaccos to smoke when, depending on one's diet. For
example, if one has eaten foods of a spicey nature (such as chili, garlic,
onions) within the last 24-72 hours one's palate and taste buds will be
seriously affected by those foods which in turn will affect the taste of
certain tobaccos as well. The impact of the above information upon my
smoking has been phenomenal! Thanks to this consideration, I now know which
tobaccos to avoid after eating Italian or Mexican food, etc., and have
enhanced my enjoyment immensely. I no longer judge a new blend hastily, but
rather weigh its characteristics against whatever foods I ingested recently
then wait before trying it again. This has saved countless time and tobacco
and resulted in more enjoyment on my part."

Wish I had that booklet; I've mailed Tobacco Express, but no answer yet.
Soon, I hope! I also hope to hear from y'all soon, too. Until next time,

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Algerian briar</a>

I have enjoyed this list and the expertise of its contributers.  I
don't usually have much to add, but I thought I would share my latest
acquisition. 

I was back up in my old stomping grounds, and couldn't resist
returning to Leavitt and Peirce to see what how my favorite
tobacconist was doing.  ('Scuse me while I load and light up :-) I
know there are better tobacconists, better pipes, and better tobaccos,
and I guess I'm a little young to be so set in my ways, but there it
is.  I got another of my favorite shape (~\V) David P. Ehrlic pipes
and some of my beloved cherry cavendish.  The pipe is a fairly tight
bird's eye on both sides with horizontal grain on the front and back
of the bowl.  Although there is a nick or two in the pipe, I cannot
find any fills.  The pipe is of Algerian briar, which the guy behind
the counter told me is almost extinct and is a harder wood than your
average briar (and thus takes longer to break in).  I smiled
ignorantly and appreciatively and paid my $25.  From my first
impressions, this pipe seems to smoke fairly cool.  What do the
members of this list know about this wood?

On smoking at work and other public places.  I'm a grad student, and
my one-fifth of a hole is too small and poorly ventilated for pipe
smoking.  I wouldn't inflict that much smoke on myself, much less on
my office mates.

While at Logan airport last Friday, I noticed one woman (non-smoker)
giving me dirty looks as I sat in the midst of the cigarette smokers.
I just put on my walkthing and ignored her.

In general, my rule is to treat the non-smoker's request in the spirit
it's given.  If they say "Would you please put your pipe out?"  I'll
reply "Certainly, I'm sorry if I was annoying you with it."  If they
say "Put that smelly, disgusting thing out!"  I'll comply, but I'll
probably mutter something like "Your mouthwash ain't making it."  I
definitely like the idea of just writing it off to your quota of
assholes for the day.

Keep the book,
brad

Amusing marketing ploy of the week:  Sherman's is now selling their
cigarettes in small boxes that say "I &lt;heart&gt; Harvard Square" -- six
for $2, such a deal! :-)

<a name="3">Subject: Get-together and a review system</a>

Dear pipe people,

At Elias Mazur's urging, I'll be journeying into the Wicked City to
attend the July meeting of the NEW YORK PIPE CLUB! Yes, I eventually
did get around to calling Sailorman Jack and ascertaining that they
were still happening, generally on the first Tuesday of every month.
In July, though, the first Tuesday happens to be July 4, and the risk
of igniting fireworks while lighting up is just too extreme. So it'll
be held as follows:

WHEN:		Tuesday, July 11, 6:00 P.M.
WHERE:		La Bonne Soupe, 48 W. 55th St., New York.
HOWMUCH:	$2.00 plus Dutch treat dinner.
WHATTOBRING:	Anything you'd like to smoke or trade, any burning
		pipe questions, and any friends	who are also
		interested in coming.
WHATTOEXPECT:	Dunno; I've never been! But there are a lot of people
		there that know a lot about pipes, so expect to learn
		some stuff and have a good pipe with some congenial
		fellow smokers.

Hope to see you there! If you'd like to get together to check out some
pipe shops in NYC beforehand, let me know and I'll carve an itinerary.
Also, there is a lot of pipe club activity in other parts of the
country; if you'd like further information, why not write in?

				~\U

Second thing: Rick Hacker says, in _The Ultimate Pipe Book_, that he
keeps a small notebook with comments about tobaccos he's tried.
Following in his footsteps (magnifying glass in hand and calabash in
mouth), I'm playing around with a reviewing system for tobacco, and
would like to share it with you and get your comments and suggestions
(and hopefully your further reviews!). It's been fun to try to review
tobacco; I've gone through Hacker's and Ehwa's books, and have learned
a fair amount about how Toback is grown, processed, and blended, as
well as what makes a mixture good. (It's often a matter of body
chemistry, so your pleasure may vary!)

I've also had fun smoking new kinds of tobacco and paying careful
attention to their qualities. You can really get into tasting the
tobacco, finding out what you enjoy about it (and what you don't),
trying to describe it in writing, and just taking time to pay
attention to the small things. (And who knows - maybe you'll find the
Perfect Blend!) Try it -- you'll like it!

I'm not presenting this system as The Perfect One; it's really a list
of things to pay attention to. So feel free to use it, suggest
changes, or throw it in the /dev/null. For me, it's a nice thing to
do, and it seems to work!

Dunhill "Royal Yacht" Mixture
-----------------------------
Type:		English.
Cut:		Long.
Strength:	Mild.
Flavoring:	None.
Package:	Vaccuum-sealed tin.
Price:		$0.75 for "trial size" (0.35 oz.).
Rating:		** 1/2.

Date: June 23, 1989. I bought this at the Highland Park tobacco shop, with a
few other samples.  It may have been on the shelf a while; there is no date
code. I smoked it in a small, straight Savinelli which I cleaned well
recently. My tounge was slightly burnt from smoking a few hours previously.
I had not eaten spicy food for about a day before.

It lights easily, burns steadily and cool. I think there is a bit of Turkish
in it. Not wet at all. A bit harsh on the upper palate when blown through
the nose. Mouth watered slightly at first. Core burns to a white ash,
charcoal around the edges. Later taste was quite good, Turkish comes
through. Base is probably Burley. Ash buildup put it out a couple of times.
No bite to speak of; it actually helped form a coat on my tongue and
cancelled the previous bite slightly. A half bowl lasted about 30 minutes.
Moderate nicotine buzz afterward.

I'd recommend it as a summer or morning smoke, or possibly for a beginning
pipe smoker who is used to Turkish cigarettes. Good with a small bowl.
Should probably retry with a fresher sample on a fresher tongue.

[ And I will! But until then... ]

Hope to see you at the NYPC on July 13 if you can make it! If not, why
not sit back with a bowl of your fave smoke and write it up? Until
next we meet, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

Our Benevolent Sponsor offers:

&gt;I'm playing around with a reviewing system for tobacco, and
&gt;would like to share it with you and get your comments and suggestions
&gt;
&gt;		STEVE'S PATENTED TOBACCO REVIEW SYSTEM
&gt;		--------------------------------------
&gt;Ratings:
&gt;	**** Outstanding; I'll make this a regular for sure.
&gt;	***  Very good; a nice "rotation" smoke.
&gt;	**   OK, once in a while.
&gt;	*    Not very good.

You're obviously a die-hard pipe smoker;  I'd have included :
             Even makes bad fertilizer
        ^- zero stars


&gt;Other things to note:
&gt;---------------------
&gt;
&gt;[ I've been writing a paragraph or two about the tobacco, and trying
&gt;to note these things. Sometimes, I succeed! ]
&gt;
&gt;- Burning characteristics: time, number of relights, ash produced.

I guess I'm not very good a pipe smoking; at least, not very efficient.
I smoke mostly dark cavendishes, which are relatively tough to keep going
in the first place; and I suspect my tamping technique leaves much to be
desired.  In any case, I tend to have to light frequently.  Of course,
a light Virginia will require fewer lights, even for me.  

In any case, I might suggest that a more useful measure is 
"Ease of Burning", (easy, moderate, difficult, use napalm), which would,
of course, be relative to the individual smoker.




Now, on another matter:

&gt; A bit harsh on the upper palate when blown through the nose. 
&gt;Moderate nicotine buzz afterward.

How many pipe smokers actually inhale the stuff ?  My dad taught me
that pipe smoke isn't to be inhaled, but rather drawn into the mouth and 
puffed out.  Likewise, cigars.

Seems as though most pipe smokers I know agree, but I've met a few
(mostly ex-cigarette smokers) who inhale to the lungs.  I can recall trying
it a few times when I was young and foolish; my old cavendish produced
quite a rush this way,  and got me wondering what exactly went into
flavoring the tobacco, and what it turned into when burned... I stopped
inhaling right away 8-)

Not trying to condemn anyone, of course; whatever floats your boat.


Finally, speaking of cigars; thanks to whoever it was that mentioned
Partagas cigars a few issues back.   I was killing time at a local smoke
shop, and, in between trying a couple bowls of new tobacco blends, noticed
their humidor.   Idly looking, I espied a box of Partagas cigars, and
a chime went off in my head.  I bought one and smoked it on the spot, while
getting something of an education in the ways of the cigar from the 
shopowner.

I must say, I enjoyed the smoke  !  A subtly different sensation from the
pipe, neither better nor worse; just different.  Having previously smoked
cigars on a college budget (i.e., A&amp;C's or Dutch Masters 8-(  ) I had
written them off as an uncouth, and rather Freudian, habit; needless to
say, I've seen the light, and now enjoy the occasional Partagas or
Plieades.  Thanks for tip !


From: Bill Thacker &lt;cbema!wbt&gt;
<a name="3">Subject: Cigars</a>

Having read good things about Partagas cigars in this group, I tried
one, and thoroughly enjoyed it; enough so that it has kindled a 
general interest in cigars.  While they're not strictly in keeping
with a "Pipe Digest", I doubt our Most Munificent and Benevolent
List Maintainer would object to a bit of banter concerning these
stogiceous delights.  And so:

I truly enjoy the finer cigars I've tried; Partagas, Plieades,
and a couple other brands.  But they're just too danged expensive
for my tobacco budget; for the price of one of these, I can get two
ounces of my favorite pipeweed, which lasts much longer.  What I
need is I, guess, a good, fifty-cent cigar.  Any suggestions ?

<a name="4">Subject: Tamping, inhaling, "Pipe Smoker..." newsletter, etc.</a>

Our Most Prolific Contributor has trouble with tamping? Incredible, in this
day and age!

Seriously, though, I've learned a few things that help in this regard. You
want the pipe to draw about as hard as a good cigar (that is, with some
small resistance), and the tobacco should be packed at the same density all
the way down the bowl.

Sometimes, the tobacco leaves may lock together, especially in long-cut
tobacco (like Cavendish). To unlock them, gently pull them apart as you fill
the bowl. Try filling in stages - in each stage, fill the bowl loosely to
the top, then compress the tobacco until it's springy. When the bowl is
full, compress again until you get the proper draw.

When lighting, first char the surface, then tamp down and char it again. The
first charring helps more of the tobacco catch a light. [Hacker84]

(It also helps to be writing for the Pipes Digest while smoking! :-)

I had a little off-line conversation with Bill about blowing smoke through
the nose; some others may be curious. I don't inhale (except on rare
occasions when I want a little, legal rush! :-), though I have known pipe
smokers who did - their lungs kind of creaked after awhile. Exhaling through
the nose without inhaling smoke is kind of like swallowing while breathing
air out through your nose. I hope those who want to learn to do it will
persevere!

Lastly, I finally got a-hold-of the "Pipe Smoker and Tobacciana Trader"
newsletter from Pipe Collectors International (P.O. Box 22085, 6172 Airways
Blvd., Chattanooga, TN 37422). I think its appeal is more for the collector
than the recreational pipe smoker - they sponsor conventions, run ads for
pipemakers and specialty tobaccos, and have a small classified section.
Unfortunately, they've just changed from 6 issues per year to four per year
(still at $15 - v.7 n.1 was a 28-page B&amp;W tabloid), due to financial
pressures. It might be worth checking it out for a year, especially for the
collectors or carvers in the group!

Speaking of which, I hope to meet some of you folks in New York next Tuesday
(see above)! Until then, keep your bowls warm and glowing.

I *had* to respond to this.  Reading this prompted instant memories of
my grandfather (lo these many years ago) putting his tobacco
(Granger?) into his hand and rolling it between his palms to grind it
into a finer texture.  Then dumping it into the pipe using his hand as
a funnel.  It was an extremely dry tobacco as I recall.  I can't
imagine rolling the tobaccos I smoke in my hands before smoking it.

And since I am writing:
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; I had a little off-line conversation with Bill about blowing smoke through
  &gt;&gt; the nose; some others may be curious. I don't inhale (except on rare
  &gt;&gt; occasions when I want a little, legal rush! :-), though I have known pipe

  &gt;&gt; the nose without inhaling smoke is kind of like swallowing while breathing
  &gt;&gt; air out through your nose. I hope those who want to learn to do it will
  &gt;&gt; persevere!
  &gt;&gt; 

I don't inhale either, or exhale through my nose.  I still get the
occasional buzz.

In my introductory posting (many months ago) I mentioned that I was no
longer an active pipe smoker.  And I said that I might discuss the
reasons later.  Well, reading this list has tempted me to try my pipe
again and the old reasons have cropped up so maybe some has some
suggestions.  

First ( and I don't expect any help here) my wife hates it.  I don't
smoke at home, but she know when I am because she can smell it on my
breath ( and taste it occasionally:-).  She is also very sensitive to
smoke in general.  If I have been at a meeting (and not currently
smoking my pipe) she knows whether someone in the room had smoked a
cigarette by the smell on my clothes when I get home several hours later.

Secondly, it makes my throat hurt.  Maybe not enough to keep me from
smoking, but enough to be distracting.

Thirdly, I am a singer and the sore throat doesn't help.  I am not a
professional, understand, but the hobbies can conflict. 

Forthly, I don't think there are any pipe shops at all in Lafayette,
Indiana!  I am reduced to smoking Captain Black, Borkum Riff and the
like.  To be premeditated enough to actually order tobacco from a mail
order house would certainly tip off my wife that her opinion is little
thought of (:-).

Cheers,
Steve Holmes

[ Hope our members can help Mr. Holmes see his way through this conundrum! -S.

<a name="3">Subject: Cigar chemistry, cigar prices, and turning briar</a>

&gt;How many pipe smokers actually inhale the stuff ?  My dad taught me
&gt;that pipe smoke isn't to be inhaled, but rather drawn into the mouth and 
&gt;puffed out.  Likewise, cigars.

I certainly don't.  My experience is like yours -- most pipe inhalers are
cigarette smokers trying to hurt themselves less.
There even may be a chemical reason for not inhaling pipes and cigars,
though the reference is long gone and I might be totally off base:
It seems that cigarette tobacco is so cured that the smoke tends to be slightly
acidic.  When it gets to the acid environment of the mouth, it finds nothing
to react quickly with, so you body can't get the "benefits" till it gets to
your lungs.  Pipe and cigar smoke is somewhat basic, so....


&gt;I truly enjoy the finer cigars I've tried; Partagas, Plieades,
&gt;and a couple other brands.  But they're just too danged expensive
&gt;for my tobacco budget....

Um.  I agree they're a luxury and only smoke one or two a week.  But even
here, where the tax has just shot way up, a Partagas costs a bit under $4.00.
Look what else you get get around here for $4.00:

	From one to two martinis in a bar, depending on whether it's a fancy
	bar with small drinks or a down-to-earth one with big ones.

	Four Its-Its(tm) chocolate-covered oatmeal-cookie ice cream sandwiches.

	Two-thirds of the admission to a movie.

Put in perspective with other luxuries, it's not bad.  And unless you smoke
the hell out of it, it'll last an hour and a half or so.


On pipe manufacture:

I had a nice chat with Jim Andre' about lathes and pipemaking.  Jim, whom
I've mentioned before, makes pipes and sell them at:

	Andre''s Pipe Gallery
	127 West Main St.
	Los Gatos, CA

About half the pipes he makes are turned.  The others are freehand.  The
difference between "hand cut" turned pipes and the others is that the
mass-production pipes use automatic lathes, like key-making machines, to
chomp out pipe after pipe.  The hand-made ones may use templates, but the 
maker will alter the shape to his mood and the nature of the wood.

He does not use fill.  If he finds a little hole, he leaves it;  if he finds
a big one, he changes the shape of the pipe or does some carving.  (I have
a very good Andre' with LOTS of carving -- it doesn't imply poor quality.)
We agreed that old fill always turned color a a different rate than the rest
of the wood and that bad old fill sometimes fall out entirely.

One of the hazards of hand-turning pipes is of course that nasty stem whomping
around and around. If you hit it with a tool, you're likely to ruin the pipe
by knocking it off entirely.  If you let it clobber your hand, it can ruin
your whole day.

Andre' is worth a visit if you're in Silicon Valley.  Los Gatos has nice res-
taurants, too.

From: ????????@?????.???????.??? (Steve Masticola)
<a name="4">Subject: The first-ever Pipenet Rendezvous</a>

On Tuesday, July 11, it finally happened. In fact, a couple of "its" finally
happened.

I met Elias Mazur. The man who threw out the first bowl. The man who took
the flame for his beliefs. The man who set the Pipes Mailgroup alight.

OK, enough smelly puns (probably too much Latakia :-). Elias and I met to
explore the New York pipe scene, and smoke a few bowls with the members of
the New York Pipe Club.

Elias was in New York for a few days, mainly to visit relatives and go on a
few interviews there and in North Jersey. We rendezvoused at Penn Station,
and recognized each other after a bit of indecision (is this the right guy?)
We had about an hour and a half before the meeting, so we visited the
Connoisseur Pipe Shop at 51 W. 46th Street. He'd been there before, and liked
their handmade pipes and "Turkish Blend" tobacco, so I convinced him to humor
me and walk the nine or so blocks there.

The Connoisseur shop is tiny. It's also very good. The owner, Mr. Edward
Frederick Burak, designs all the pipes that the store sells; they also
custom-blend their own tobacco. There were no ceramic German beer steins or
lottery machines in evidence. It's a _serious_ pipeshop.

Mr. Burak wasn't in, but the salesman who was there was knowledgable and
helpful (in a New York-y kind of way, i.e., with vague disdain :-). We
admired the freehands behind the counter and in a glass cabinet at the front
of the store, but neither of us had plans to spend $250 for a pipe that day.
(If you've ever been in grad school, you know why not.) I decided on a
purchase - a huge bent rough-carved pipe ("NOT sandblast! Sandblasting shocks
the wood!" declared the salesman) and four ounces of their Turkish Black
tobacco, which he and Elias had both endorsed. ("What kind of tobacco do you
usually smoke?" "Well, lately I've been smoking some Sherlock's Choice from
the Tinder Box..."  "TINDER Box? Bah!" The salestype was assuredly not too
shy to express an opinion.) The three or four pipes I'd brought were
neglected for the rest of the evening, in favor of The Pipe That Burned
Manhattan And Parts of the Bronx.

Elias and I had hoped to also see Pipeworks and Wilke on 55th Street, but by
the time we got there the store had closed. We contented ourselves with a
short look through the window, then sallied forth to La Bonne Soupe to
negotiate the provendor of some souply comestibles. And, of course, to smoke
some good pipes and have some good conversation.

We asked where the Pipe Club meeting was ("Upstairs - you CAN'T miss 'em!"),
and up we went, following our noses. Steve Shoopak, also from Rutgers, had
been in the city all day, and he greeted us as we entered the dining room.
About fifteen people were there, smoking, trading, and talking pipes with
gusto. 

Steve, Elias, and I picked out a table to one side of the general hubbub and
ordered dinner. The food was excellent, and very reasonable. A few times
during dinner, one of the club members would come over and ask us if we had
any pipes to trade; unfortunately, none of us had (Steve, sadly, hadn't even
brought his own pipe; it had been temporarily, but irretrievably, buried in
the course of moving!) One gentleman was intent on selling his copy of
Richard Hacker's "Ultimate Pipe Video", and made a point of offering it to
all comers. (I'd like to see it someday, but have no plans to actually own
it.)

After dinner, Elias and I finally lit up, he with a small, beautiful briar
with brass inlays (which was admired by all), I with my new Connoisseur.
Sailorman Jack, the president of the club, eventually came in, welcomed us
warmly, and introduced us to the other members. We scouted around the dinner
tables, smoking, investigating the pipes on display, and exchanging views
with the members. Elias came across a nice buy: a small, straight-grain
Comoy that he picked up for a song; I, meanwhile, bought the Pipe Club's
handsome T-shirt (another copy of which was later given to the
long-suffering waitress!) 

We eventually drifted back over to our original tables, and joined the
Sailorman and a varying cast of other members in a wide-ranging conversation.
We talked of history, politics, plays, the ethics of the warrior, the nature
of college education, and of course pipes. Time flew; Elias and I shifted
from the Turkish Black to Balkan Sobranie, by way of a home-blended vanilla
mixture I accepted from another member. My pipe and I began to know and
trust each other, as did the old and the new members of the Club. My
friends, if you ever can an evening smoking your pipe and conversing with
intelligent fellows over good wine and beer, please by all means do so
without hesitation. It was a time of great quality.

Gradually, bowls burned low and members drifted into the night; soon it was
time to find our way home. Elias and I parted at the subway, vowing to
return to the Pipe Club next month if we could find a way. As I waited for
the returning train, I finished the last puffs from the Connoisseur's huge
bowl, and became aware of the glance of a pretty young lady, presumably also
biding her time for a train. Alas, I could do no more than to return it in
kind; the station, unlike the Club, does not encourage strangers to become
friends.

<a name="2">Subject: Cigars Ordinaire</a>

Someone was asking about 50-cent cigars the other week.  I can't 
honestly recommend any,  but have a suggestion to repeat.

You have to remember that Partagas and Pleiades and H. Upmann and
Montecruz and the like are the creme de la creme, the vintage wines of
the puffing world. (I even saw some cigars this weekend with a Rothschild
brand.  $7.10.  Gulp.)  These are for special occasions, for me, anyway.

For a good, solid, cigar, look to all-tobacco ones from the Connecticut
Valley.  One good brand is Breva ($.80 this morning), another is Judges
Cave.  Now these are to the Partagas as jug red is to fine Burgundy,
but they're honest cigars.

The words to watch out for on cigar boxes are "Predominantly tobacco
with non-tobacco materials added."  They mean that the cigar is a brown
paper tube stuffed with chopped tobacco, perhaps wrapped with paper
made from tobacco leavings.  These cigars, my friends, are stinky fat
cigarettes.

For other less expensive smokes, try some of the European dry-cured
cigars.  They're different, but good.  Let me strain my spelling skill
and suggest Schimmelpennick.

But there's a reason those Partagas cost so much.  Sigh.

[I know, I know, I got off pipes completely.  I'm planning to be at 
SIGGRAPH in Boston at the end of the month.  I'll bring my pipes, and
maybe revisit Ehrlich's.  Will anyone else be there?]		~

<a name="5">Subject: NYPC on August 1, matches, etc.</a>

Well, as anyone who saw the last posting knows, a few of us got together at
the New York Pipe Club's monthly meeting and had a really enjoyable time. If
you're in the NYC area on Tuesday, August 1, why not plan on dropping in for
some soup, a good smoke, and some interesting and friendly chatter? The event
will occur at La Bonne Soupe, 48 W. 55th St., at 6:00 P.M. This time I'll
try to leave enough time to check out the Wilke shop, also on 55th St. Hope
to see you there!

Ami Silberman asked, awhile ago, about matches for pipe smoking, and
recommended Swan Vestas. Well, after 3 or 4 boxes, I really have to say that
I like Diamond Safety Matches (the kind in the pocket-size boxes) better,
because they're both longer and less expensive. My only gripes with Diamonds
are that they're _hard_ to find (finally tracked them down at an Acme
supermarket in Flemington!), and they are a bit hard to keep lit initially,
especially in a breeze (though I think Vestas have the same problem). For
those who are coming to NYPC, La Bonne Soupe _gives away_ some very good
quality wooden matches!

Oh, yes - one fellow at last month's soiree' offered me some tobacco, which
I accepted. When I scratched a match to light it, he retorted, "Forget that
stuff!" and produced a lighter, which I accepted out of politeness. I have
to say that I'm philosophically opposed to lighters - they burn the lip of
the bowl if they're up too high or if you're lighting a fresh pipe. Also,
there's something much more aesthetically pleasing about lighting a pipe
with a match (they don't hiss, for one thing!) But to each his own.

The _ne plus ultra_ of pipe smoking is, of course, to pick up a coal from a
wood fire and use that to light your pipe - you taste the wood and tobacco
smoke, and it just feels so comforting. (Make sure to use tongs, or it
won't! :-)

We've been adding a few new members here and there - always glad for a
bigger audience, and some new voices and new info! Speaking of which, Tom
Dunn promises us a mention in the next _Ephemeris_, so we should hopefully
see some more people aboard soon through those channels. In the meantime,
pleasant living to you all!

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

&gt; Ami Silberman asked, awhile ago, about matches for pipe smoking, and
&gt; recommended Swan Vestas. Well, after 3 or 4 boxes, I really have to say that
&gt; I like Diamond Safety Matches (the kind in the pocket-size boxes) better,
&gt; because they're both longer and less expensive. My only gripes with Diamonds
&gt; are that they're _hard_ to find (finally tracked them down at an Acme
&gt; supermarket in Flemington!), and they are a bit hard to keep lit initially,
&gt; especially in a breeze (though I think Vestas have the same problem).

For outdoors, it's awful hard to beat a simple Bic Butane lighter.  I
normally use a somewhat classy lighter (i.e., it cost more than ten
bucks), but for whatever reason, the Bics are simply easier to keep lit.
(I figure it must be the little metal screen around the nozzle).  Too,
you don't feel bad if you lose one.

&gt; Oh, yes - one fellow at last month's soiree' offered me some tobacco, which
&gt; I accepted. When I scratched a match to light it, he retorted, "Forget that
&gt; stuff!" and produced a lighter, which I accepted out of politeness. I have
&gt; to say that I'm philosophically opposed to lighters - they burn the lip of
&gt; the bowl if they're up too high or if you're lighting a fresh pipe.

True.  If I'm sitting around the house smoking, esp. a new pipe, I'll
reach for a match.  Too, my best pipes don't leave my apartment, for fear
of having them lost or banged up.  Anything I walk around with, I'm willing
to light with butane.


&gt;Also,
&gt; there's something much more aesthetically pleasing about lighting a pipe
&gt; with a match (they don't hiss, for one thing!) 

Ah, but let's see you blow out the match and then stick it back in your
pocket 8-)
 
&gt; The _ne plus ultra_ of pipe smoking is, of course, to pick up a coal from a
&gt; wood fire and use that to light your pipe - you taste the wood and tobacco
&gt; smoke, and it just feels so comforting. (Make sure to use tongs, or it
&gt; won't! :-)

Anybody tried those cedar sticks some cigar smokers use ?

Alternately, the true die-hard (or those, like myself, in fits of
desparation) can light his pipe using his car's cigarette lighter.  No
chemical tastes there !

<a name="3">Subject: Pipe stands, accidents, and longevity</a>

As it happens, I've had a couple of accidents this week. The first was to
my cherished old Ben Wade "Hand Pipe."

I'd inherited a pipe stand from a friend whose father hadn't used it for
years, and who had in fact given up pipes :-( The stand may have been the
reason... In any case, it's sitting on top of my credenza, and the Ben Wade
(a large freehand with at least four different comfortable hand positions
built in) was on the end, precariously poised above empty space.

Well, Friday, the inevitable happened. The pipe took a swan dive off the
stand and landed stem-first on top of my desk. End of stem. Searching
through my back issues of P.D., I located the "Pipes Unlimited" address that
Elias had posted, and will be sending the pipe to Utica, NY for repairs. By
the time it gets back, I may even be able to smoke again...

Because, the very day after the pipe broke, I had an accident on my bicycle.
Crashed the sucker into a car. My fine old Raleigh Gran Sport was totalled,
as was my helmet (thank G*d it was on!), and I have chips out of four teeth
and a very sore neck. So I haven't been smoking since, for fear of damaging
the stem or my teeth. Sigh.

But I have been looking up a reference about pipe smoking and longevity,
which might be of interest... Apparently, pipe smokers live about exactly as
long as those who don't indulge (according to "The Health Consequences of
Smoking," published by the US. Department of Health, Education and Welfare
in 1973). There are other rumors out that pipe smokers may actually live up
to 18 months _longer_ than nonsmokers! (Maybe the Latakia fumigates the
germs...) I'll post as I learn more.

In any case, this represents conclusive proof that bicycling is a greater
health risk than pipe smoking (though I wish I hadn't been an experimental
subject!) After all, most people are tolerant enough of pipes that they're
not going to try to run you over just for smoking - I hope!

Anyway, please light up for me in my involuntary abstinence, and we hope to
hear from you soon.

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #20 - July 31, 1989</a>

I've just located your bboard from Pittsburgh, and I thought I'd give a little
free advice on those members who are interested in getting Cigars less
expensively --

While I'm a haphazard pipe smoker at best, I've been smoking cigars fairly
regularly for the past ten years.  Since, for most of that time, I've been on a
student budget, I've become pretty adept at finding good quality smokes at
decent prices.

Most "name" cigars that you can purchase are really just "names." Pleides and
the top line Dunhill cigars, in my opinion, are two of the most overrated and
overpriced cigars that can be bought (As are the Davidoffs -- which I haven't
seen recently, which may be a good sign . . . ).

Most imported cigars that are sold in the US come from factories in
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Canary Islands, and Honduras. The
strength or body of the smoke is determined by its place of origin
(with the order listed above as a rough indicator strenth -- Jamacian
cigars being the mildest), the color of the wrapper (with strength
increasing with the darkness of the wrapper, from the acrid green
claro wrapper through the medium brown wrapper called EMS or English
Market Selection to the nutty, sweetish, dark brown maduro), and the
size of the cigar (a function of diameter, or ring gauge, rather then
of length -- the ring gauge, of course, determining the volume of
smoke inhaled).

Factories produce cigars and then sell them to the different companies
whose name you see on the box.  Unfortunately for the factories, and
fortunately for you, production and the companies' demands do not
always coincide.  Overrun cigars, or seconds cigars (which may or may
not be an indication of quality -- cigars can be rejected for aethetic
reasons such as color) are sold, by most reputable tobacconists, as
"bundle" cigars, noted by their place of origin ( e.g., Dominican
bundles, and so on).  In all my meanderings, these cigars are usually
half the price of their named doubles, ranging in price from, say .75
to 2.00.  (Unfortunately, the .50 imported cigar is probably as rare
as the kiwi bird).

The largest retailer of cigars in America, incidently, bypasses all
this buys his cigars directly from the factories and then sells them
very inexpensively through mail order.  His name is JR Rothman, and
his #is 1-800-JR-CIGAR (catchy, eh?).  His "alternative" cigars are
probably the best buy around.

While I enjoy a Partagas now and again, and could happily survive on a diet of_
__Excalibur I _cigars, I am content with usually smoking bundled cigars.   I
hope this information helps the club members who take up a cigar, the way I
occassionally enjoy a pipe of tobacco.

<a name="2">Subject: Pipes notes</a>

I've been rather disconcerted  lately  about  the  lack  of  news
comming  across  the _PIPES_ newsletter.  In order to be fair, I
guess it is like wanting to get mail from somebody.  If you don't
write  you  won't  receive.  So,  with that in mind I will add my
notes about pipe wanderings.

My creation is complete!!!  I finally found the right kind of wax
to  put on my pipe in order finish the wood.  I have been smoking
this pipe exclusively for the last couple of  days  in  order  to
break  it  in.  Of course it's the best smoking pipe that I have,
hard to be disappointed in a pipe you built yourself.  I  am  now
looking  around  for  a  small lathe (Used!) in order to turn the
next briar that I have.  Maybe if I get good enough I  can  offer
pipes for sale.

I made a visit to Andre's Pipe Shop in Los Gatos CA.  Even toting
along  the  wife and family (normally a mistake when going into a
smoke shop) I had a very good time.  The shop is  very  low  key,
and  not  too big (more like a wide hallway).  The person working
the counter was very friendly ( a lost art out here  in  CA)  and
wanted  know  where  I had heard about the shop.  My reference to
this news group impressed him and he was fascinated by  how  many
ways news could get around these days.  I asked him about Andre's
pipes and he pointed to the case closest to him and said that  it
was  open.  I  examined most of the pipes and they were very good
and very honest.  I  could  not  find  any  fills  and  this  was
confirmed  by the salesman saying that only a few pipes were ever
filled, the  pits  (few  and  small)  were  left  in.  They  were
arranged  in  the cabinet by price; value pipes on the bottom and
collector's pipes on the top.  I could afford to  buy  one  about
half  way  up.  The  next  pipe that I buy will be an Andre, I am
pretty sure.

I went to a smoke shop in San  Jose  called  _Smokers  Paradise_.
This  is  a  good  shop,  their  top  of  the line pipes are just
beautiful (anybody got a spare $200 to let  a  poor  pipe  smoker
realize his dream?).  The only problem with the shop is that they
cover the full range of smoking, and I  mean  FULL  range.  So  I
don't care for the "Head Shop" section of the store.  While I was
there I bought an old  edition  of  a  publication  called  _Pipe
Smoker_.  This  is  the  quarterly(?)  newsletter  of  PCI, _Pipe
Smokers International_.  I have read this 12 page  magazine  from
cover to cover and enjoyed each article.  They had just had a big
convention in St.  Louis (this was in 1985).  Do any of you  know
if  this  organization  still  exists?  I  am tempted to become a
member just for the newsletter, but  they  offer  other  services
like club pipes and conventions.

Well that's all for now, but I think there is a  pipe  convention
here  locally  in  the  S.F.  Bay Area (are you ready for another
trip Steve?) I will write if I can find out about the convention.

[Norm, thanks for your comments, and congratulations on your new
creation! What shape did you carve? It's not too likely I can get to
S. F. for the convention, but I hope you'll make it, and that we'll
meet in person sometime!  Read on for some further, hopefully relevant
musings on your letter. -S.]

<a name="3">Subject: Participatory pipeocracy</a>

Well, once again it's time to fill a favorite pipe (this time, a large
Peterson), and edit the digest. This time, I'll say a few things about
the mailgroup itself, in response to Norm's letter.

When I started the group, the volume of messages behaved somewhat
predictably - a lot of things got posted at first, and then the talk
burned down a bit. I never expected a huge volume of messages, for a
variety of reasons. 

First off, we're a small group (about 20-30 members, not counting the
digest echo into arpanet). It's not likely to get huge; I forget the
percentage of people who smoke pipes, but it's something like 5%, and
far fewer of us make a hobby out of pipes. We're never going to have
the volume of soc.singles (not that we should!)

Second, my tactic in putting out the letter has been to accumulate
mailings until Sunday, and (assuming someone's submitted something),
to send them out then. That way, those of us who have Real (tm) Jobs
will have something to look forward to on Monday mornings, before we
have to really get down to business! Does anyone have comments on
whether this encourages people to send things in? (Or whether you like
it in general.)

Also, the only way you have new things to say is if you learn new
things! If it's been ages since you tried any new blends of tobacco,
why not go pick up a sample and let us know what you think? You might
find something you really enjoy; at worst, you can save the rest of us
from being subjected to Old Anthracite :-)

You can also pick up a lot of information talking to others; that's
what the group is for. I'd also urge you to get in touch with a pipe
club, or go to some swap meets. It's also rewarding to sit down, light
up, and swap opinions with a friend, old or new! And you'll have some
new stories to bring back to us. I hope you'll try it!

We'd love to hear from you! And we promise no flame, except as applied
to your favorite smoke. :-)

				~\U

OK, now on to some other things... Norm, the address for the Pipe
Smoker tabloid is:

	Pipe Collectors International
	P. O. Box 22085
	6172 Airways Blvd.
	Chattanooga, TN 37422

For $15, they'll send you one year's worth (i.e., four issues); they
also have some members-only offers on pipes, and those look like an
excellent value! They could use your support, I'm sure!

The last issue mentions some upcoming pipe conventions, but none in
the Bay Area specifically. But here's what's still coming up. All of
these meets have hotel and table space available (yr. obd't. servant
is a bit too lazy to retype them all! :-)

<a name="2">Subject: Volume of articles</a>

Our Most Aromatic Highness writes:

&gt; I never expected a huge volume of messages, for a variety of reasons. 
&gt; 
&gt; First off, we're a small group (about 20-30 members, not counting the
&gt; digest echo into arpanet). It's not likely to get huge; I forget the
&gt; percentage of people who smoke pipes, but it's something like 5%, and
&gt; far fewer of us make a hobby out of pipes. We're never going to have
&gt; the volume of soc.singles (not that we should!)

A good point;  and I would suggest that even some of "us" aren't
quite true hobbyists. Myself, for example.

As an analogy, consider wine.  Many people drink it; a fraction of
those really bother to learn about what they're drinking, enough to
know a few good vintages, possibly build up a small wine cellar, know
what wines to serve when, etc.  To translate this into pipe terms, I'd
say, would include knowledge of technical matters (for example, how
pipes are made; hand- vs. machine-carved,  pits and fills, finishes, etc.),
tobacco lore (how it's grown, cured, flavored, blended), history, etc. 
On that basis, I personally don't qualify as a "hobbyist", though
I'm slowly becoming one, thanks largely to this group.

BTW, I do enjoy receiving the digests on Mondays.  Anything is better than
getting down to work that morning... 8-)




<a name="3">Subject:   Tobacco Roots</a>


There's one area of smoking I *do* know something about, and that's
tobacco growing.  Now, I don't know a *lot*, but I'll bet others in
this group can fill in the gaps.

My grandparents used to raise a bit of tobacco on their southwestern Ohio
farm, so this is mostly from youthful experience (I helped them from
the time I was about 9 years old until I went off to college).  They grew
Seed Leaf, a variety of tobacco used mostly for cigars, so take that as
a caveat; there are differences in how the various tobaccos are grown,
and I have experience only with this sort.

Tobacco growing is highly regulated, to maintain price control.  This means
that each grower has a "base", a certain acreage he is allowed to grow.
Each farmer grows as much as his base will allow, because it is a very
high-value crop.   It is also extremely complicated and labor-intensive.

Because each square foot of the base acreage is so valuable, great pains are
taken to ensure complete utilization.   The tobacco growing season begins
in early spring, when seedbeds are turned up.   A seedbed is a small plot
of land where the seeds will be planted and nurtured, until the "sprouts"
are large enough to transplant into the fields.  Young tobacco is slow-
growing and fragile; left on its own in a harsh world, it will suffer huge
"infant mortality" to insects, and to weeds which grow more quickly and
steal its sunlight and nutrients.

So the tobacco beds are spaded to up-end and us loosen the soil.  Next,
large metal pans (about 6 feet long and three to four wide (the width of
the beds) are inverted over the turned soil; into these pans is piped live
steam.  The purpose is to sterilize the soil; it is about to be heavily
fertilzed and pampered, which is weed heaven.

Steaming itself is rather amazing.  The steamer my grandpa hired each year
had an old Ford truck with the bed removed, and a small locomotive steam
engine fitted.  It looked like something out of the 1800's.  In fact, the
whistle was still fitted, and at the end of the job, he'd let go with a
long blast  (and sometimes he'd even let us kids pull the rope ! 8-)

Once the beds are steamed, 6" high wooden frames are erected around them.
The beds are fertilzed, then seeded; then a tent of thin canvas is 
stretched over them, to keep out insects and airborne seed (The
canvas is thin enough to allow sunlight in).  The beds are then watered 
daily and fertilized several times a week, until the plants have grown 
to a height of about six inches.  This period is sort of tricky;  too 
much fertilzer can "burn" the plants (the fertilizer is ammonia-based,
so too much of it can increase the alkalinity of the soil too far), and
too much water can lead to rot and mildew.

A word on seed.   My grandfather always saved seed from the previous year's
crop, and I gathered that this was the norm.   A gentleman at a local
smoke shop told me that tobacco quickly adapts to its locality.  His
example was the vaunted Cuban Seed Leaf, so coveted by cigar smokers.  He
claimed that, while seed could be taken from Cuba to other
locations, such as Honduras, and would grow Cuban-quality plants the first
year, the seed produced by those plants would be adapted to the
new environment, and produce a very different crop the next year.  I
don't understand this, genetically, but I suppose the differences
between the two tobaccos are small enough to make it believable.

In any case, tobacco seed is apparently quite valuable;  so much so,
in fact, the my grandfather carefully protected his, to such an extent
that I've never seen any !

My, how I do go on !   I can see this is going to run into quite a bit more
than I'd expected, so I think I'll break it into several installments.
We'll let our seedlings grow for a week, and next time, we'll discuss
tobacco setting.

<a name="4">Subject: Pipes_digest - misc. matters</a>

I have enjoyed the pipes_digest very much.  Reading the comments it seems
that I have been smoking a pipe for a very long time, that is, in
compairson to the times mentioned - I have been doing so almost 30
years.  My first was a prop for a production of a play as a Senior in
High School!!

But I do have a question:  Does anyone know of a pipe shop in Columbus,
Ohio?  I believe that it was on Gay Street.  I had dealings with them
almost a decade ago.  The were very big on GBD pipes - their exclusive
was a hourglass shape - which I have enjoyed for over 15 years.  I
wonder if they are still in business - I have lost the name and
address.  I could not at the time afford most of their offerings, but
did splurge on the hour-glass.  I have bought a few of the "cheapee" or
rejects from Connoisseur and have been satisfied.  Anyone remember
when they also sold coffee and tea in addition to pipes and tobacco?

	Lastly, an earlier message mentioned that an archive server
was running.  I have tried twice with no response.  Any additional
information?  Perhaps you could resend the address and indicate the
contents?

<a name="5">Subject: Boston stores; age of college students; power tools; related matters</a>

At SIGGRAPH this year I had the chance to check out some Boston smoking
haunts from my youth and am pleased to say they are doing fine.  
They include David P. Ehrlich's, L. J. Peretti, and Leavitt and Pearce.
Note that there are no cute business names.  Note that none of them are
in (my pet peeve) malls.  Note that all three of them
were founded before anyone we ever knew was born.*

Peretti's (Park Circle, at the juncture of the Common and the Public Garden)
is the most traditional in one sense -- it makes no particular attempt to
look old.  It just is.  The selection of tobaccos is complete and includes
many straight tobaccos for blending.  The pipes are varied and reasonable.

Ehrlich's (Tremont Street, between Scollay Square (now Government Center)
and Park Street, next to Erich Fuchs, a fine hobby store) is a little glitz-
ier, with fancy wood and such about.  The owner said that they had trouble
insuring their wonderful collection of old meerschaum, and that is had moved
to "the Tobacco Museum in Nashville."  I'd certainly like to hear more
about that place.

Anyway, I picked up one of their seconds ($12.95) for old time's sake, and
some tobacco, and some cigars of a new brand.  It was a good visit.

Like most tobacco stores, Ehrlich's has had to branch out a bit.  But 
instead of beer steins or statues of sailors, they decided to stock a
few fine wines.  Good for them.

(Smoker's Paradise is, as Norm says, a trifle weird. It has carried
"branching out" about as far as is possible.  The tobacco side
of the store includes very small and exotic-looking pipes, not to mention
Fat Freddy comics.  The other side is a lock shop with ton-sized safes
lying around.  If you have more than a few dozen old Dunhills, you might
need one :-))

Ehrlich's sister store, Leavitt and Pierce in Harvard Square, has changed
even less.  (College students have gotten young, though...)  For many
years _their_ sideline was board games, mostly chess.  They still have
lots of chess stuff, but have acquired a fine stock of go paraphernalia
and literature as well.  It was a good visit.

----

Norm, it was good to hear that you finished your pipe and that you liked
Andre's.  Good luck with finding a used lathe.  Unfortunately, things like
that don't seem to come on the used market until they're all beat up or
their owner dies.  The Unimat(tm) system seems to be of a good size
for pipes, and includes an indexing jig that you could use for the kind
of faceted pipes you described earlier.  With all the right pieces, it
would spend up most of a grand, though.  You can buy lotsa pipes for that.

The one pipe store in Soquel, whose name slips my mind, has a meerschaum
carving kit for sale, though.  You might explore that as a next project.

(Soquel is one town south of Santa Cruz, on the coast 40 miles over the
hill from Silicon Valley.  A nice place to visit, but not worth the haul
just for that store.)

---
*Well, they were founded a long time ago.  I was born in 1944.  My neighbor
at one house, a Mrs. Corcoran, was born in 1855 and lived till 1952.  I
received a watch from her as a posthumous birthday present.  Anyway, Mrs.
Corcoran may have antedated one or more of these stores.

___
I've used up my alloted time without even mentioning my new pipe.
Not the Ehrlich cheapie, which is giving good service, but the other one.
Wait for next time.  Smoke safely; the drought is everywhere.
Keep those contributions coming.

[ Thanks for all the good info - I've got to look into the Boston pipe
  scene at some point! Looking forward to hearing about your "other" new
  acquisition. -S. ]

(hum the Main Title from Star Wars as you read this)


                    When last we left our 
                 intrepid young plants, they 
              were safe and snug in their beds, 
          awaiting  that brave new dawn that would 
      see them standing  in the broad  expanse of the 
   Back Forty.  But  Darth Nature still holds a few cards,
and  you shouldn't  count your  tobacco until  it's smoking...


[insert dazzling special effects here]


Okay, the time has come.  Our tobacco plants are shoosting up out of the
ground, eager to live free.  Over the next week or two, we'll be
transplanting them into the field.

In preparation, the soil in the field is first tilled; plowed, then disked
repeatedly and levelled, to provide a soft, flat bed for the tender young
plants.  This is done the morning of the planting, for maximum effect.

The tobacco beds are heavily watered, section by section, to loosen the
soil so that the sprouts can be plucked out, roots and all, without damage.
Enough plants are "pulled" for the day's transplanting; over the planting
season, each section will be pulled two or three times; after the first
picking, the remaining plants grow more rapidly.  Plants are perfect for
tranplanting when about 6" or more high. 

The pulled plants are kept in wooden boxes, metal washpans, etc, and packed
rather tightly to retain moisture during the day.   They are kept in the
shade, to keep them cool; if they wilt, they become harde to handle.

While the tobacco is pulled, (which, someone, seems to be mostly women's
work, and a fine place to pick up gossip 8-)  the menfolk prepare the
equipment.  The water wagon (a wagon mounting a large water tank) is
filled, a trailer is loaded with fertilier, insecticide, and herbicide,
and the transplanter is greased and checked. By the time this is done, it's
11:00 and time for dinner.  In the afternoon, this curious armada drives 
out to the field and sets up shop.  

The transplanter is a curious affair. It's a small, two-wheeled trailer,
towed behind a tractor.  On it are two rearward-facing seats for the
"setters" (so called because they "set" the tobacco); between them is a
vertically-looped conveyer belt which bears a number of rubber "fingers."
As the planter moves along, this chain-driven belt moves through a guide
which closes the fingers, in which the setters have placed a plant.  The
plant is carried down inside a small plow, which has created a shallow
trench; as the plant's roots reach the trench, a dose of
insecticide-bearing water (from a tank on the rear of the planter) is 
dropped in.  Fertilizer (from a front-mounted hopper) has already been laid
alongside the trench.

As the fingers reach the bottom of their travel and begin to open, two
wheels roll past, gently squeezing the soil around the plant.  Finally,
a herbicide mixture is sprayed along the row of plants.

This is a necessarily slow process; the setters can only feed plants so
fast.  (In fact, they occasionally miss one or more, so that a small boy
(yours truly, for several years 8-) rides the water barrel with a peg
and a handful of plants, ready to jump down and fill in any missed spots).
An afternoon's work sees two or three acres set.

Two-row planters, requiring four setters, exist, and there are legends of
4-row monsters 8-)

The next step is to wait for a rain a week or so later.  After the rain,
while the ground is still muddy, barefooted workers (another good job
for small boys who've recently read Huck Finn) walk the fields, looking for
gaps where plants have failed to survive the shock of transplanting.
They carry a few plants and a wooden peg, and reset these missing spots.

The plants are now largely on their own now for most of the growing
season; all that is done is to cultivate them about once every two or three
weeks.  A small tractor with a set of "cultivators" (shallow plows,
designed to cut just below the soil surface) drives along each row,
uprooting the weeds growing between the row.  During the earliest part of
the season, while the plants are still small enough to be shaded by weeds,
workers even manually hoe between the plants, where the cultivators can't
reach.

Next week:  Flowers, Topping, and the Sucker Menace

Michael J. Lavery asks:

&gt; But I do have a question:  Does anyone know of a pipe shop in Columbus,
&gt; Ohio?  I believe that it was on Gay Street.

I know of several, but none on Gay.  Perhaps you're thinking of Smoker's
Haven, on High Street just south of Gay ?  17 S. High Street, 
(614) 221-4555.

<a name="3">Subject: How Old Is This Pipe?</a>

Atop the bookshelf next to my Smoking Chair is an old pipe, that's
been in my family a lot longer than I have.  My understanding has
always been that it belonged to my great-grandfather (a Civil War
veteran), which would make it a century or so old, but an article I
recently saw in passing has caused me to wonder if it isn't much
older.

The bowl is porcelein, long and graceful, with a hinged &amp; vented cap
of what I take to be brass.  The bowl is decorated with a painting
(not, apparently, a decal) of a stag.  There is a joint below the
bowl that is also porcelein, and forms an acute angle, so the stem
points straight up when the bowl is upright.  The stem is of
unpeeled (cherry?) wood, about 10 inchel long, with a
flexible-appearing section of some woven fabric about 2 cm in
length.  Over that is a round, bent mouthpiece.  The bowl was
cracked many (50+) years ago, but the pipe was apparently felt to be
too valuable to discard.  Obviously, I don't smoke it, but the
residue in the bowl indicates it has been smoked, though probably
not in living memory.

The article I saw had a drawing of an identical pipe, which it
labeled a mid-17th century design!  Can it be that my ancestor
bought it as an antique?  Is there a kind and erudite reader of this
group who can shed some light on this?

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

After a long and painful process, only alleviated by my relaxing
moments enjoyed with my pipes, I finally got a job. This means that I
will be able to keep in touch with the group and enjoy reading our now
famous pipe digest.

My new job is located in Madison, NJ, which means that I will be able
to take advantage of the many pipe stores in NYC and also able to
attend the meetings of the NY Pipe Club. Before starting the job I
will travel to Brazil to visit my family. I will spend 3 to 4 weeks
there.

Since I haven't been very active lately,( reason: the famous 'moving
adventure') I will try to catch up on some topics discussed here in
the past pipe digests. I followed the discussion about cigars and I
would like to give a suggestion to those of you that, like me, enjoy a
good cigar once in a while. There is a very good cigar, hard to find,
made in Brazil, more specificly in Bahia, the state in Brazil where I
come from. It is definitely worth a try.  It is called Suerdick and
I'm sure that many of you have seen and tried it before. It is a very
good cigar and considered world wide as one of the best. The reason
behind its quality is the climate of the region where they grow the
tobacco. The climate is very similar to the one in Cuba, and that's
why Mr. Suerdick started his plantation in that area some time ago.
They have a wide variety of types of cigars, but I am not very
familiar with it. Since I am going to be there, I will buy a fairly
large number of them, considering that the price is something like 20%
of the price here in the USA and is always easy to find. I will give
more details of these cigars when I come back from Brazil.

Back to pipes, I can say that I finally came to fully appreciate
free-hand pipes. I got an excellent deal the last time I went to Mr
Bob Smith's store in Utica, and bought my second free-hand. Very good
pipe! The advantage of the free-hand is that they are usually made
from the very top of the briar root, which is the best part of the
wood and gives a beautiful straight grain. This provides a very cool
smoke. I am sure that soon I will add another one to my collection.

Well, I will be back from Brazil by the end of September. Until then,
I wish you all a cool and pleasant smoke till the last puff of your
pipe. 

Smoke in peace.

- Elias Mazur.

Well, folks, my neck is almost healed, I'm still fighting it out with the
health insurance, and I'm going to try once more to visit the New York Pipe
Club's meeting this Tuesday. It's at the usual place (La Bonne Soupe, 48 W.
55th St.) at 6 PM. Please let me know if you'd like to come along or
rendezvous up there - there are bargains, good food, and good fellowship to
be had!

I learned something surprising this weekend, while stuck in a traffic jam on
Route 30, east of Lancaster, PA. Along the side of the road, a group of ten
or so Amish farmers were harvesting a fine-looking crop of Pennsylvania
tobacco. (Didn't even know they grew tabak in PA - nor even what it was
until my friend identified it for me!) They were, of course, using two
horses and a buckboard as their only machinery, and seemed a bit shy about
being gawked at by the "English". Quite a few of the barns in the area are
built for tobacco curing - they have narrow, high vertical boards which can
be moved around to control airflow.

Also in the Something New Every Day Dept: Sailorman Jack, of the New York
Pipe Club, writes that used pipe cleaners can be re-used to initially clean
a pipe, following up with fresh cleaners. Claims Joe Tannenbaum of NYPC:
"The pipe doesn't know the difference." Sailorman claims to have reduced his
pipe cleaner consumption by 75% - while getting his pipes just as clean.
(NYPC Newsletter, August 1989).

I'll probably be getting very busy after the next meeting, and don't know
how many more of them I can make in the next few months. So, I hope some of
the Greater New York (i.e., Entire East Coast, according to NYC :-) crowd
can attend and join me for a pipe or two. Until next time, then, hope I can
hear from you on the mailgroup, and as always,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

From: Bill Thacker &lt;cbema!wbt&gt;
<a name="2">Subject:   Tobacco Roots III - The Growing Menace</a>
 
After the first few critical weeks, the tobacco plants become
very hardy.  They are, by nature, large and bushy, so they tend to
shade out any weeds which would compete; and there are not many
predators that care to eat any but the youngest plants.

One of those that do exist, though, is the tobacco worm
(eatimus cavendish); a large (1/2"x2") green caterpillar.  These are not a
major threat, as they don't eat much, but they are worth controlling for
Seed Leaf growers because they cut holes in the leaves, rendering them
unusable for cigar wrapping.  Spray insecticides are sufficient, and only
one application, after the initial planting, is needed.

Another threat, particularly later in the season, is hail;  a heavy
hailstorm can ruin the leaves, greatly reducing the crop's worth.

The next thing that needs attention comes near the end of the growing
season (about 4 months), as the plants mature.  To reproduce, the plants
(which by now are large bushes; about 4 feet tall and 3 feet across) send
up tall spikes, which will produce pink flowers.

The reproductive cycle, though, saps the plant's energy away from the
leaves, much as intact genitals will sap a bull's strength away from
meat development.  Therefore,  just as the rancher "steers" his bull
calves,  the grower will walk the fields, snapping off (sorry for the
imagery 8-) the spikes from all but a half-dozen (in my grandpa's case) 
plants, which will be allowed to produce the next year's seed.  

The plant, though, doesn't give up so easily.  Deprived of its family
jewels, it will produce small, stickly (high tar content, I suppose) 
buds near the severed stalk.  These "suckers" serve no useful purpose, but
divert energy, so they, too must be snapped off.  Typically, the flowering
and suckering operations will take place at three to five day intervals over
about 2-3 weeks; some plants will flower later than others.

We're now into August, and the plants are mature.   When the weather is
right (that is, dry and hot), and early in the morning, the plants are cut.
This is usually done by hand at Grandpa's; you walk along the row, bending
the plants over with the left hand to expose the base of the stalk (by now,
about an inch in diameter and very woody; about like ginger root, for those
Chinese cooks out there), while the right hand swings a cutting tool,
either a machete or an axe-like cutter.   The plants are left to lie on
their sides for several hours, until early afternoon; and only a few acres
are cut each day (that is, you only cut what you can take in).

The hot, dry weather is important; as it lies, the tobacco wilts from the
heat.  This greatly facilitates later handling, as "crisp" plants are far
more fragile.

Now comes the *really* labor-intensive part 8-)  A large field crew, fueled
by a typically-large farm dinner, goes out to the field.  A wagon is driven
alongside of the newly-cut tobacco, bearing a supply of "laths", strips of
wood (hickory is preferred, but oak is common) about 1/4"x1"x48" long on
the front, plus a couple of water jugs and a bucket of hard candy for the
workers.  About 4 spudders will walk, each covering two rows of tobacco;
they carry a hollow-backed steel spearpoint, or spud, which is placed on one end
of the lath, while the other is stuck against the ground.   The spudder
picks up a tobacco plant with one hand, and sits it on the spud point
(a task requiring a bit of deftness; the plants are a bit heavy to handly
one-handed, so you have to *swing* the stalk upward in an arc so that it
lands on the spud) about 4-6" below the cut end of the stalk.  Then, the
other hand is brought up to drive the plant onto the spud, and thus, 
the lath.  Plants are spudded 6-10 inches apart, depending on size.  When
the lath is full, the spudder hands it back to his/her "carrier", who
hands the spudder an empty lath, and takes the full one to the wagon, 
handing it up to the "stacker", who stacks it flat.  A stack of tobacco
one lath deep is called a "rick", and 3 ricks fill a wagon.

The laden wagon is then swapped for an empty one, and taken to to
tobacco shed, a tall barn with beam rafters spaced about 40" apart, just
right for suspending the laths.  In the shed, one worker unloads the wagon,
handing the full laths to another man standing in the rafters.  Depending
on the height of the barn, and horizontal distance from the wagon, the
lath may be passed several times before it is "hung".   The barn is hot and
dusty, which, along with the extra hazard or working in the rafters, earns
the shed crew bonus pay.  (I've never seen anyone fall from the beams,
though).  They then load fresh laths onto the wagon and return it to the
field crew.

A full crew for a typical day's work at Grandpa's would then be a field
tractor driver, a stacker, 4 spudders, 4 carriers, and a half-dozen
hangers, one of whom also drives a tractor; about 16 people all told.
It took about 6-8 such days over a two-week period to bring in all of
Grandpa's tobacco, weather permitting.

As has been mentioned, the tobacco shed has slats in the sideboards which
can be opened to vary air flow.  It will hang for several months until
it has cured.  What started as a succulent, green plant ends as a dried,
shriveled corpse; the leaves have the leather-brown look and paper-thin,
tough texture familiar to cigar smokers.

We're almost done now, but I'll taunt you with the exciting conclusion.
Stay tuned to this digest next week, same tobac-time, same tobac-channel.

<a name="3">Subject: A couple of questions.</a>

I am very happy to see the amount of interesting traffic  in  our
small  mail  circle.  I  really  enjoy  the article about growing
tobacco (keep 'em comming).  I am  afraid  that  I,  like  Steve,
wouldn't know a tobacco plant from beans.  But I do love to smoke
the stuff in my pipes.  Which leads me to my first question.

When I first light my pipe is the best time to  enjoy  the  aroma
and  taste  of the tobacco.  When I get down to the bottom of the
bowl, a lot of the flavor is gone and I seem to be sucking ashes.
Is  there  a  good  way  to  smoke the tobacco all the way to the
bottom (got to get that heel cake established)  and  still  enjoy
the tobacco as if it were first lit?

My second question I hesitate to bring up because my  foolishness
might  have  cost me a  valuable possesion.  We have a local flea
market here which is on the parking lot of a  college  campus. It
is  held only once a month so there is still a pretty good mix of
household treasures along with the commercial junk.  While I  was
there  I kept my eye out for pipes.  I happened along a pipe that
was a cross between a freehand and a more standard pipe.  By this
I  mean that the bowlwas a freehand cube and the shank was square
flaring out towards the fitting end.  The stem  was  one  of  the
freehand  variety,  turned  and  not motised into the shank.  The
pipe was a Ben Wade and he was asking $25.

In the standard tradition of the flea market society,  I  offered
him  $15  for his pipe.  This guy was a non-conformist.  He stuck
to his original $25 price.  I left  and  went  around  the  whole
place.  A couple hours later, as I was leaving, I returned to his
booth and found that all his other pipes had been sold,  but  the
Ben  Wade  was still there.  I gave it one more pitch and offered
$20.  He still held on to his price, and  my  wife,  who  doesn't
smoke, was indifferent to the transaction.  I left in disgrace of
not having accomplished barganing skills (with the right person I
might  normally have gotten them to give me the pipe 8-&gt;).  Did I
miss a golden opportunity?

Smokin' the same old pipes in CA.

From: Steve Masticola (????????@?????.???????.???)
<a name="4">Subject: Norm's questions</a>

I'm also glad we've been having some more activity here! I'll
contribute my share by answering Norm's questions (tho I might be
totally off base, in which case I'm sure someone will set me aright
(alight? :-)

Well, I almost never have the problem of the flavor being gone at the
bottom of a pipe - in fact, usually the reverse is true for me! (The
tobacco sometimes gets juicy and kind of rank.) 

But the fact that you're getting a lot of ash at the end implies that
you might be leaving the tobacco loose at the bottom of the bowl. Try
packing the bowl a little more firmly at the bottom and see if that
doesn't help.

Another possibility is that the tobacco has dried out and crumbled
into dust, as it often will when being bounced around in a pouch. The
only cure for that is to get some new!

Regarding the used Ben Wade, offhand it doesn't sound like you passed
up an outstandingly valuable pipe. Ben Wades retail in the range of
about $50 (or used to when I was buying a lot of pipes) - actually, I
think they're the brand name Stanwell uses to market their seconds.

Regardless of who made it or how much it originally cost, you can
approach used pipes as a collector or as a casual smoker. If I were
being casual about it, I'd look for a good deal the same way I would
if I were buying a new pipe (check fills, sand pits, grain appearance)
and look for damage (broken stem, cracks in the wood, burns around the
tobacco hole, scuffs, stains, spots, etc). A stem can be replaced (and
this would be a good bargaining point), but damage to the bowl is
harder to undo invisibly. Basically, don't buy a used pipe unless
you'd feel good doing so!

This reminds me of a rack of pipes I saw at a flea market a month or
two ago. These disabled veterans qualified as some of the most pitiful
specimens of pipedom - complete with house paint stains, burns
_through_ the bowls, cracks in shanks and stems, and every kind of
defect imaginable except living fleas. The price was marked at $35 for
an ugly rack full of unsmokable pipes. I looked at them, hoping for an
errant Dunhill, but they remained totally nondescript under close
scrutiny.  The owner, seeing what he took to be my interest, offered
to come down to $30. He may well remain their owner to this day. :-)

Of course, someone who's a serious collector will have to do a lot
more research about brand history - this gets into stuff like pre-
versus post- transition Barlings, Sasieni one-, four-, and eight-dots,
and like arcana about which I claim no expertise. Ben Rappaport wrote
a "Guide to Collecting Antique Pipes", which is still in print; this,
plus Hacker's book, are a start. But for noncollectors, I still
believe the rule is to buy what you'd like to smoke. That way, when
you buy, you'll...

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

		Pipes Digest #26 - Sept. 19, 1989


From: Bill Thacker &lt;cbema!wbt&gt;
<a name="2">Subject:   Tobacco Roots IV - From Root to Cheroot</a>

My memory of dates starts to fade on me... but in about November,
the hanging tobacco is cured.  Most of the water is dessicated away,
though the leaves should not be brittle.  At this point is is ready to
be "stripped" of its leaves.

Adjoining one of Grandpa's  tobacco sheds was the strip house; a
cement-block lean-to, with a wood-burning stove and ringed with benches.
Being cold weather, the stove was a necessity, of course.  Stripping
was "woman's work", which here, as on most farms, meant that everyone
helped, but the women kept at it when the men had other things to do 8-)

The laths of tobacco are brought down from the shed a few at a time; about
a day's worth.  The stalks are removed from the laths (the latter being
stored in a rack until the next season) and taken into the strip house.
There, the leaves are stripped off by hand into "hands", hand-sized
bunches.  Care is taken to keep the leaves flat, so they don't crease.
The leaves are sorted as they're stripped; damaged, worm-eaten, or overly-
dry leaves are segregated into the "trash" pile, the rest are carefully
packed into the baler.

The baler is a simple wooden box, about 4 feet long, a foot and a half
wide, and 2 feet or so deep.  The short ends are removable.  Three lengths
of twine string are laid in the baler, equally spaced along the length
of the box, with the ends handing over the long sides, then heavy brown paper
is laid over the strings to line the box.   The hands of tobacco are then 
laid in the box, their long direction parallel to the box's.  When the
baler is full, a top is placed on it; this has clamps attaching to
the bottom and levers to tighten it down, compressing the tobacco leaves.
The bale is "pressed" for about half an hour, then the top is removed, the
paper folded over, and the strings tied tight.  The sideboards are then
removed, and out comes a bale of tobacco, wrapped in paper and belted with
three strings.   This is stored in the shed.

When enough trash has been accumulated, it, too, is baled, and stored
separately.

The empty stalks are thrown in a manure spreaader and used as fertilizer.
They don't make great fertilizer, but you've got to do *something* with
them....

After that, the tobacco bales are trucked to a distributor.  As I
understand it (no personal experience here), some of them are then
opened for grading, and they are then auctioned to manufacturers.  The
quality leaves are used for wrapping cigars, while the poorer ones, 
including the trash, are ground for filler or pulped for juice for
the worst grade cigars.

That, then, is the story of Ohio-grown seed leaf.   There are, of course,
a number of other methods.  For example, in parts of New England it is
common to erect cheesecloth tents over the tobacco in the field, to
produce "shade-grown" tobacco.   Burley is a completely different beast;
for starts, it's much taller, six feet or so, and it requires a longer
growing season than Ohio provides.  I'm told Burley is stripped in the
field, with the leaves themselves being spudded onto laths for hanging.

As you've seen, tobacco is a very labor-intensive crop, not readily
suitable for automation.  Each leaf is valuable;  I can't say how much
is paid per pound of leaf, but I do know that Grandpa's two dozen or
so acres was his biggest cash crop.  Still, I would hazard that the
increase in minimum wages since my childhood has probably taken a big
bite out of that profit margin, which perhaps explains why I don't see much
tobacco being grown in tht area today.  Grandpa gave it up about 7 years
or so ago.

		Pipes Digest #27 - October 1, 1989

From: Steve Masticola (????????@?????.???????.???)
<a name="2">Subject: This ought to get a reaction...</a>

I'm taking the liberty of reprinting the following from the October
newsletter of the New York Pipe Club, without immediate comment.

			    --==ooo==--

			"Say Yes To Pipes"

Join me in striking a blow against the sheep-like, anti-smoking
puritans. Pipe smoking is good for the smoker and good for society.
From my perspective, virulent anti-smokers are perverts who are not
interested in health (a subject about which they know nothing.)
Rather, the motivation of the anti-smoker is the exercise of power
over others. Since racial and religious prejudice is unfashionable,
these poor souls have their raison d'etre in railing against smokers.
Yielding to the inappropriate complaints of the power-seeking
anti-smokers merely encourages them. Are there three or four (or more)
club members who will join me in having dinner at a well-known
restaurant which has a pipe motif and yet frowns on smoking? As the
dinner begins, all of us would light up (in the smoking section, of
course). If the restaurant officials ask us to stop smoking, we would
refuse. At this restaurant, I anticipate that dinner would cost
approximately $25 to $30 per person. Phone me if you think you might
like to participate. [212-288-3832 - SPM.] We'll discuss details over
the phone.

[ Sailorman Jack is probably referring to Kean's English Chop House, a
NYC eatery which has adopted a no-smoking policy, despite its decor
(thousands of clay pipes, which formerly belonged to "members" of
Kean's). - SPM.]

<a name="2">Subject: What else do people (legally) put in pipes?</a>

There have, of course, been pipes in the world for a long time;
probably since before the Neolithic Revolution. But tobacco smoking,
unless I am seriously misinformed, was restricted to the Americas
until the period of European colonization.

Now, in this period of waning tobacco use, I wonder what other herbs
might prove interesting (though I don't want to be *too* surprised!)
to throw in a pipe; for instance, my father always said that they tried
smoking tea leaves and corn silk when they were kids.  Any ideas,
folklore, personal experience? I remember seeing, briefly, something
called (roughly) "Herbal Smokes" in a tobacconist's once upon a time.
What about additives? I saw something called "Deer's Tongue (or was it
foot?) in that same shop; that was an herb, my good man Len explained,
put in for flavoring.

Coffee grounds, BTW, should be right out, IMHO.

Not garbled.  A combination of Earthquake and being away from Unix for a
couple of weeks.  My system was acting funny yesterday and I entered mail
for the pipe message by accident.  I sent you the mail without realizing
what I had done until it was too late.  

On the pipe side,  I was in Italy on business 2 weeks ago and was looking
around for pipes.  There were a lot of beutiful samples there,  but not
that good a deal on price.  Does one of our group know what cities produce
pipes?

Status: R


We are all doing pretty good.  I haven't seen people around so shaken
up about an earthquake before.  We ride out 2 or 3 a year,  but they
never do this kind of damage.  Anyway,  none of my pipes got hurt.  One
casualty of the quake though may be Andre's pipe shop.  It is in downtown
Los Gatos and if it didn't fall down from the quake,  it might go under due
to lack of business.  People are staying away from where the more serious
problems occurred so merchants who are open aren't getting much patronage.

Hmmm, and what have *we* been smoking in our pipe, eh ?

8-)

And now for the real purpose:

I got a thing in the mail from some mail-order cigar company;
Thompson,or Thomas, or something like that.  I've seen and discarded
them before I started smoking stogies, but this time it caught my eye.

Basically, they offer a trial package of 40-odd cigars, in an assortment of
styles, for about ten bucks.  Images of a 25-cent cigar aside, does anyone
have any experience with these folks ?  None of their products seem to
be "whole leaf"; i.e., they use chopped filling, but I seem to recall
reading that they are all tobacco, no paper filling.

&gt; to throw in a pipe; for instance, my father always said that they
&gt; tried smoking tea leaves and corn silk when they were kids.

I've tried both, again when I was a kid. Corn silk burns very hot; tea
leaves are just nasty (at least the ones in tea bags are - never tried
the loose variety.) I've also heard of people trying to get high by
smoking catnip. It apparently takes a large amount to feel any buzz
and is a very unpleasant smoke.

Cigarettes with clove or incense used to be popular in the 60s,
probably to cover the aroma of other types of burning vegetation. :-)
Never tried these; has anyone else?

I think that almost everyone who now smokes a pipe probably tried
"non-tobacco materials", as they say on the El Productos, when they
were kids. Which brings up another topic: how did y'all start smoking
a pipe? I'll go first.

I started pretty young. The first time I remember having a pipe in my
mouth was when I was about five. (No, it wasn't loaded at the time!)
There had been a cartoon on featuring a little character who had a
pipe from which issued not smoke, but _pies_ (got the pun?) Being an
imitative kid, I grabbed my father's dime-store straight bulldog and
put a piece of pie in it to see if I could repeat the feat. I don't
remember getting spanked for it :-)

Around 8 or so, I read "Tom Sawyer" and, again in imitation, started
trying to make my own.  I'd use corncobs, or a piece of 2x4, drilled
out with a spade bit and saber-sawed into a rough cylinder, with a
milkweed stem. I'd then get something to smoke in it (tea, loose
cigarette tobacco, and even sometimes "Old Briar" raided from my
father's pouch), and go out to a convenient woods and attempt to
smoke. The taste must have been phenomenally awful!

At about that time, a neighbor kid told me that he smoked his father's
pipes all the time. I believed him until I asked to watch him. He just
mumbled about not knowing when he was going to smoke. (My guess was it
wouldn't be for the next several years.) But until then, I was
properly envious!

I bought a pipe ostensibly for my dad's birthday when I was 13, but of
course I really wanted it for my own use. With some trepidation, I
announced this to my mom, who advised me to get my father's old pipe
and smoke it (expecting me to fall over coughing, no doubt!) Well, I
did so, nervously and without enjoying it much, but without obvious
ill effects (except much embarrassment!) Later, I kind of wished the
whole thing had never happened, and didn't smoke again for some time.
The new pipe was delivered to my dad, but I think he knew what was up.
:-) But I must admit I'm still a bit embarrassed to smoke around other
people, especially my folks.

My first "proper" pipe followed me at 15, and smoked it through the
final years of high school and my first time at college. I still have
it - like Brad Blumenthal's, it's shaped like ~\V, a typical teenage
wizard-in-training pipe. :-) (On the downside, it smokes hot and has a
thin shank which has now acquired a crack.) Though I don't smoke it
very much anymore, it remains my oldest friend among the briars.

Now that I'm all grown up (physically, anyway!) and may eventually
start a family, I sometimes wonder how I'll deal with them about
smoking. I'd want to avoid a double standard ("I can smoke but you
shouldn't!"), and I'd also want them to avoid cigarettes! So, if they
just had to smoke, I'd try to steer them toward a pipe (girls, too,
though I'd clue them in on the realities about being thought "wierd".
Personally, I don't think pipes are inherently masculine, and have
thought that the few female pipe smokers I've seen have brought it off
rather well. But this is digressing...)

Until they got to be of age, I think it would be proper to say,
"Smoking is really for grown-ups only, but I'd rather have you smoking
here with us than sneaking around. So, if you want to smoke, just come
and ask me to borrow one of my pipes. But it's to be pipes only, and
only in the house, and you've got to ask." (That is, unless I marry a
woman who smokes cigarettes, in which case, "pipes only" is going to
be tougher on the integrity.)

But all this is down the road. Do any of you have children? If so, how
do you deal (or plan to deal) with them about smoking? Please
follow-up if you can.

Until next time, then,

					Smoke in peace,

					~\U Steve.

		 Pipes Digest #30 - November 11, 1989

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
<a name="2">Subject: Clays and churchwardens, Italian pipes</a>

Greetings, gang! This 30th issue marks yet another "decade" in the
history of the pipes mailgroup, and I'm glad to see that we're still
generating some good discussions - and new members. Welcome to
Christopher M. Polk (???@??????.??.??????.???), who describes himself
as an "avid pipe smoker". Glad to have you aboard, Christopher!

And now, accompanied by a GBD bulldog and some John David's "African
Blend", I'll try to answer Norm's question about Italian pipemakers.
Of course, Savinelli, located im Milan, is probably the largest
Italian supplier to the U.S. market. Running through the pipe library,
here are some others of note. Where possible, I've put in locations or
contact addresses.

Arminelli:	Cucciago
Ascorti:
Baldo Baldi:	Contact GEMPI, PO Box 12521, Charleston, SC 29412
Becker:		Via della Panetteria 49 Rome
Bonfiglioli:	Via Piella 8/A, 40126 Bologna
Caminetto:	
Capitello:	Call Marble Arch, Ltd., 516-561-8555
Castello:	Cantu
Cesare:
Il Ceppo:	Call 800-523-1641
Sir Jacopo:
Lorenzo:
Paronelli:	Via del Chiostro, 5 - 20126 Gavvirate
Radice:		Brianza province (near Milan and Torino) - Marble Arch, Ltd.
Savinelli:	Milan
Talamona:	Call 800-292-CLUB

Caminetto, Ascorti, and Radice have some history in common ("Pipe
Smoker", July 1987 - let me know if you want a copy of the article.)
There's also a briar sawmill you might want to visit in Sassetta (Jan
'87). 

You might also want to visit Claudio Rebecchi's "Tobacco Museum" (P.O.
Box 5, 41100 Modena 10, Italy) - good photos in the July 1989 "Pipe
Smoker".

And furthermore, Italy has several active pipe clubs you might write
to:

Amici Della Pipa, Casella Postale 01734, Roma Eur
Dirieffe Pipe Club, Davide Piva, Via. G. di Vittorio, 7/b, 30170 
	Mestre, Venezia
Extra-Extra, Corso Vittorio Emanuele 37/B, 20122 Milano
Fortunato, Casella Postale 10374 Roma
La Pipa (contact J.M. Alberto Paronelli, above)
Museo Italiano Della Pipa, Via Della Chiostro 5, 21026 Gavirate (Varese)
Smoking, Via della Colonna Antonina, 35, 00186 Roma

(Gee, Italy seems to be _overrun_ with pipe makers! I guess it's a
cottage industry there, even though most of them distribute through
sole sources [which is why there are so many "Contact so-and-so's" in
the addresses]. Further information or corrections are welcome. Good
hunting, Norm!)

			     --==ooo==--

And now, a few questions of my own:

- Where the heck can I find a quality churchwarden these days? No one
seems to be making them anymore! Does anyone out there smoke one? They
look like fun, even if you do have to use extra-extra-long cleaners!

- Does anyone own a clay pipe? I just got a catalog from Lepeltier
(Box 61, East Fairfield, VT 05448) - they make a line of double-walled
clays that have about the same shape as briar pipes, and which they
purport to smoke cooler. At $15, it's a fairly cheap experiment, but
your comments would be appreciated!

Now, I really should finish the GBD and get cracking for my Ph.D exam.
Hope to hear from y'all (Southern - NJ equivalent, "yous" :-) soon! In
the meantime, keep the home briars burning.

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

From: ?????????@?????.??.???

Just a few notes I've accumulated over the past few weeks:
___
Andre's Pipe Gallery in Los Gatos was, as Norm speculated, closed by the
earthquake.  Its building is red-tagged, meaning that for the time being
people aren't allowed.  There's a strong preservationist feeling in L. G.,
though, and the building might be restored.

Locals should be aware that most of Los Gatos in open for business and could
use your support.
___
As long as I'm on quaky ground, I should mention the late lamented Union
Cigar store, formerly of Santa Cruz.  It was around since early this century.
At the front it had magazines on the left and tobacco on the right.  Deep
in the back was a section dealing in fishing tackle, including high-quality
custom-made rods.  One charming feature was an open gas jet at the front,
to light your cigars at.

Four or five years ago, the fire-insurance boys shut down the gas flame.
About two years ago, the store closed.  Last month, its building was destroyed
by the earthquake.  Sic transit gloria mundi.

___
During the 60's, I smoked some eucalyptus a few times.  The idea was to
smooth out the smoking qualities of some (ahem) other stuff that was popular
in those days.  

Didn't work, though.  Imagine smoking Vapo-Rub.  Imagine smoking Vapo-Rub while
in a giggly mood anyway.  Imagine giggling away all that expensive smoke...

___
Most of us, particularly when stoking our pipes from plastic bags, have been
teased about the possibility of our using non-tobacco products. ("No wonder
you look so happy," etc.)

According to the San Francisco Examiner, a bailiff in Sacramento wasn't kidding
last September.  When passing lawyer stubbed out his Honduras Repeater cigar,
the cop got suspicious and told the judge that the attorney was smoking weed.

Further study of the butt exonerated the barrister.  Last I heard, he
was asking for a mistrial.

___ 
I have tried Thompson cigars.  The cheapos are just that.  They also
have decent long-filler cigars for reasonable prices.

Their service is excellent.  I sent some cigars back; the refund was prompt and
included postage.


__
Till next time,

&gt; Welcome to

I used to smoke an Avid, but I gave it up for a Ben Wade.  Welcome aboard,

&gt; - Where the heck can I find a quality churchwarden these days? No one

&gt; look like fun, even if you do have to use extra-extra-long cleaners!

They are fun, though don't expect to do any walking around.  I have a
churchwarden made by a local pipesmith, T.M. West.  Haven't been to his
shop since he moved to a high-class mall downtown, but I can call and
furnish an address if you want to mail order one.  I can vouch that Tim's
pipes are (at least, *were*) of good quality, so you wouldn't be taking
a big risk.

Mighty nice for watching Star Trek or reading a book; the pipe bowl
rests in my lap, and is just right for cradling in the palm of my
hand without having to raise my arm 8-)
 
Thanks for the info about Thompson's.  I think I'll order their trial
pack and give'em to people I don't like, then order some long leaf stuff
for myself 8-)

				- later-


&gt; Thanks for the info about Tim West; I have his address (like Sherwin Williams,
&gt; I cover the world!) How much, if I might inquire, did it set you back?
&gt; Did you get one with a smooth or a rough surface?

I bought it, oh, 6 years ago; I think I paid $35 at the time.  The
churchwardens I've seen have all been relatively inexpensive; I guess
because they tend to be small-bowled pipes, and so require less briar.

Mine has a smooth surface;  I detest rough (sandblasted) surfaces, though
I can tolerate rough-carved surfaces.   I'd rather have a smooth surface
with a few pits and fills...  (my churchwarden, BTW, had neither that I
could detect.

I bought my first Tim West pipe when he ran his shop out of a little
place called Monkey's Retreat; it featured a comic/underground magazine
store, a "head shop", and Tim's pipe store in the back.  It was very close
to Ohio State, and I bought a curved-stem apple from him in 1980.  It's
still my favorite pipe, despite the fact that a large chip was broken off
the bowl rim after I dropped it.  (I took it in to have it re-stemmed,
(not at Tim's), and the shopkeeper suggested it was a waste of money on
such a damaged pipe.  "Just *do* it," I told him. 8-)

		 Pipes Digest #32 - December 24, 1989

Today is a lot of different days - the day before Christmas (or X-mess
for us Grinches), the 2^5 issue of the Digest, and the day we welcome
a new member, Bart (or Pestilence (I print 'em as they come in,
folks!)), who's also new to the pipe. I'll get out my Ben Wade and
join you in a smoke, B/P!

Bill, thanks for the words on Tim West. I've written him a letter
asking for a price quote - so far no reply, but I said not to hurry,
so that's not surprising. In the meantime, I discovered that both
Peterson and Savinelli make churchwardens, and have found a source for
the Sav's for about $30. Not bad! I have to take issue about smooth
vs. rough surfaces, though... I have an oversized carved-surface bent
I bought from Connoisseur in NYC, and it's now one of my favorite
pipes. Rough surfaces make it possible to afford good quality briar,
sans fills. The textures can be interesting (though I admit birds-eye
is pretty), and the pipe acquires a patina as it is smoked and
handled. However, I'm still too proud to buy a pipe which has been
lacquered. Never have owned a sandblast, so I can't comment on my
prejudices owing to not having any. :-)

As some of you may know, "Pipe Smoker and Tobacciana Trader" folded
last month - bought by the Old Virginia Tobacco Company (publishers of
"Smoker's Pipeline.") People are being encouraged to convert their
subscriptions, and they've sent out a preliminary issue of S.P. Can't
say I'm thrilled with what I've seen (they seem to aim at collectors,
especially those into buying perfect pipes at $250 and then leaving
them on the shelf! Talk about conspicuous consumption!) But I'll
suspend judgment until I see their full Xmas issue, which should be
coming out in early January (!).

Also, I must admit that I sometimes read one of the "alt" newsgroups
associated with hedonistic use of "certain substances." I have noticed
a lot of surprising (and I think hypocritical) anti-tobacco arguments
there, along the lines of "&lt;Substance&gt; killed 3000 people last year,
cigarettes killed 300,000, so we should legalize &lt;substance&gt; and
outlaw tobacco." Yes, tobacco is a d**g, but cigarettes are not the
only way to use it. Cigarettes are to pipes as guzzling beer is to
sipping fine wine - and are a dangerous and highly addictive form at
that. To conclude this missive, I don't mind if those guys have their
favorite herbs legal, just so mine is too. Like anything else with
some danger potential, it's all in how you handle it - if you can
enjoy a cigarette every now and then without getting addicted, I'll
light up my pipe and join you.

If any of you read this before Christmas, please let me know - I'm
just curious. And if you do, I hope you'll find a good friend on
Christmas day, and join him or her under the tree for a pipeful of
your best.

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Re:  Requesting membership to pipes.</a>

Well, to be honest, I haven't been into pipe smoking very long (and probably
by many standards, I have started yet).  In the middle of this summer, I was
walking around a drug store near where I live, and I  saw about 15 different
kinds of pipes.  Seeing as I was almost always completely broke at the time,
there was only 1 pipe I could buy: (yes, I know you guys are probably laughing
already but...) a Dr. Grabow corn-cob pipe and some Borkum Riff cherry
blend tobacco. :-)  I didn't even get a tamper until last week (either when
I had the money, I couldn't find one, or when I was broke, I couldn't).

Anyway, even this li'l corn-cob (told to me to be a good beginner's pipe) does
give me sufficient smoking pleasure, so when I heard about this newsgroup, I
jumped on the chance to join so I could find out the best that I can get (yep,
finally got a job).  I love spending time walking around the nearest pipe
shop (a "Tinder Box" at a nearby mall).

Well, that's about all I can think of at the time.  That and I'm very happy
to be in this little group (little? no idea how big).

Later, all . . .

Hello,
	Sorry it's so close to the holidays, but I just wanted to ask
whether the group has been dwindling, or has my address been lost in the
network somewhere (has happened before, alas).
	Anyway, sorry to bother you.  Happy smoking!

Later,

[ Bart - Congratulations on your admission to the Order of the
Smoldering Bowl (Corncob Coterie)! Plagarize away, too - whatever
lights yer baccy. Readership hasn't gone down - I only remove people
when they request it or when their mail repeatedly bounces and I can't
contact them. Talkership, however, has declined some recently. There's
only one cure for that, though... to put in yer own two scents (make
one of mine Latakia and the other Virginia :-), as you've just done.
Thanks! -S. ]

Well, to settle your curiosity, I received the digest at 4:43pm on x-mess-eve.
(yup, I'm a Grinch too :-)

Also, perfect timing for the Digest too!  Right on my birthday!  Thanx!

Well, talk to ya sometime... Happy smoking!
~\U - Bart

ps. Got my friend an "Omega"-style pipe for x-mess, and he loves it!  We may
have another member soon. . .

[ To which I replied: "What's an Omega?" And he said... ]

Thanx.

It's a Dr. Grabow "Omega" pipe.  At least that's what the box called it.
To me, it looked like a standard, bent-style, Sherlock Holmes pipe. :-)

I take it Dr. Grabow is not the company I should be learning all my pipe
trivia and information from, eh?

&gt; I take it Dr. Grabow is not the company I should be learning all my pipe

Hey, as long as you like to smoke it, it's fine. But if it has a lacquer
or paint outer finish, you'd probably be better off with a good "second"
from your local pipe shop. The cost shouldn't be all that much different.
If there's lacquer inside the bowl, don't even smoke the thing (yeech!
I can't really believe there are people who do things like that to an
innocent briar, but it's a fact that there are!)

Also, there's a shop in NYC called the "Connoisseur" that sells good-quality
pipes in the $30-40 range. These are either carved or smooth; the smooth
ones may show some surface flaws. Also, another shop called "With Pipe
and Book" in upstate NY has a nice assortment of pipes in the $25 range.
I'm away from the addresses, but if you're interested let me know and I'll
mail them to you. Both places take mail orders and put out catalogs.

Lastly, don't knock Dr. Grabow out of hand (unless you have a cork knocker :-)
Kaywoodies used to be thought of as a "drugstore" pipe, now the old ones
are collector's items.

Y'know, this reminds me of my college days.  As I mentioned, Tim West
used to share a store with, among other things, a "head shop", so that,
while perusing his fine briars, I also discovered a wide variety of
"alternative", er, utensils.

Among these were, of course, "bongs" (bhangs), those little water pipes
with tiny bowls suitable for only the most powerful smokes... latakia,
I presume 8-)  These, in turn, made me think of a full-sized Indian 
hooka, the floor-model water pipe with, I think, a generous sized bowl,
intended for tobacco.

Has anyone ever smoked pipe tobacco from any of these, or other, water
pipes ?  There would seem to be certain advantages, portability not
being among them.

Well, no comment on the cherry blend, but there's nothing wrong with a
corncob !   Best smoke this side of $20 !  Never smoked a Grabow cob
(or *any* Grabow, for that matter; if I want something filtered, I drink
beer 8-) , but a $3 Missouri Meerschaum is tough to beat.

In addition to being a fine smoke for the money, a corncob has several
other advantages.  It's light; it cools quickly between smokes; and if
it falls out of your pocket somewhere on the back forty, it's no big deal.

It just doesn't go well with a 3-piece suit... 8-)

<a name="2">Subject: Flea market relic or gimick!</a>

I was at one of our local flea markets yesterday (nope, not a single Ben Wade
in the lot).  I happened on a guy who was getting rid of some of his pipe
smoking things.  One item caught my eye.  It was a pipe pump.  Anyone ever
hear of this thing before?  It lets you clamp the stummel up against a device
that looks something like a small bicycle pump.  Then you pump your pipe and
(as the add claims) you have a cleaner and fresher pipe "just like new".

Anybody know about this thing?

Again, I'm gonna apologize for asking what are probably silly questions, but
I'm new to this and the terminology is somewhat confusing.  What is a
"cork knocker"?

I just got a catalogue from Connoisseur and With Pipe and Book, thanx for
the addresses, Steve!  Now's the fun-time which I spend alot of time (and
most probably cash :-) to find my preferences.

&gt; Well, no comment on the cherry blend, but there's nothing wrong with a
&gt; corncob !   Best smoke this side of $20 !

May I ask you a question? (well, you can't answer now, so I'll ask anyway :-)
Is there a time which you should replace the ol' corncob?  The taste I'm
getting towards the bottom of the bowl is really starting to get strange
even tho' I clean the pipe and change the filter often.  Again, sorry for
asking what is quite probably a silly question, but hey, what can I say?

Later all,

  wondering])

bottom of an ashtray to hit a pipe against to knock out the ashes; (b)

<a name="4">Subject: Back again...</a>

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

  Sorry for being away from our mailgroup for such a long time. As you
probably remember I just moved from a quite academic life into a
pretty hectic professional life. No complaints, except lack of time to
write to the mailgroup.

  Before I started my new job, I went to Brazil for what I consider a
well deserved one-month vacation/visit to my family. It was very
relaxing. Yes I did bring some very nice cigars, but unfortunately
Brazil is still far from having good pipe tobacco.

  Now let's talk about what is really important: pipes. Since I got
back from Brazil I have added some good pipes to my collection, that
seems to be growing steadly. The first one was my first carved pipe.
It is an Armellini, curved stem. I found it in a mall pipe store, and
I was amazed to see Armellini there, and even better, with a very nice
price. In another mall (I moved to NJ and I only see malls...), I
found a pipe store with good pipes but well over priced. They were
having a sale though, with some very nice Danish pipes made by a man
called Preben Holm, who according to the salesman, which seemed to
know a pretty good deal about pipes, passed away just a few months
ago. I bought two of his pipes, one carved and one smooth surface with
a very nice grain.

   Just a few days ago I went to NYC for a demo of the product our
company represent and decided to go to the pipe shop by the restaurant
'La Bonne Soup' where the NYC pipe club meet every month. As walked
into the pipe shop I bumped into Mr. Sailorman Jack, responsible for
the NYC club. We had a very pleasant conversation while I looked for a
pipe, and the sales person in the shop gave me some of his personal
tobacco mixture, an English blend on Latakia, Perique, Virginia and
some cigar leafs. Very strong but very interesting. The store is
located on the 55th street, between 5th and 6th Ave. I ended up buying
a very large pipe made by an American pipe maker, whose name I can't
remember now.

    I found a very intersting piece of pipe culture that I would like
to share with the group. One of my work colleagues is very interested
in the Sherlocke Holmes literature, and as we were talking about it
the other day he mentioned he had a annotated book about Sherlock
Holmes, which he brought the next day. I was browsing through the book
and found this very interesting note about a passage in the case 'The
Gloria Scott':

    "'Then he lit his pipe'. In his scholarly monograph on Holmes and
Tobacco ("No Fire Without Smoke"), Mr John L. Hicks has written that:
"No one can seriously doubt that the Master preferred a pipe to cigars
and cigarettes. He smokes a pipe in thirty-five of the sixty cases in
the Canon, probably does in three others and in still another talks
about his pipe without, as far as the reader knows, actually lighting
it. He smokes nothing but a pipe in twenty-nine.[...] Briar, clay and
cherrywood are ... the only ones mentioned in the Sacred Writings...
Most admirers of Sherlock Holmes have believed that his favorite pipe
was made of clay, ... but evidence supports the theory that Holmes
liked a briar pipe better than any other kind.
     It will be noted that neither Holmes nor Watson ever mentioned a
pipe with a curved stem; indeed, Mr. John Dickinson Carr has stated
that the curved pipe was unknown in England until the time of the
Boer War (1889). Why, then has the curved pipe - a calabash or a
meerschaum for example- become a Holmesian trademark? Because Gilette,
in playing the role of Holmes, found it difficult to speak his lines
with a straight pipe between his lips."


  Well, I'm happy I finally found some time to write to the mailgroup
again. I will try to keep it up.

  Smoke in peace. ~\U

&gt;Is there a time which you should replace the ol' corncob?  The taste I'm
&gt;getting towards the bottom of the bowl is really starting to get strange
&gt;even tho' I clean the pipe and change the filter often.

Strange, how ? Like burnt corncob ?  (Does it taste like you left the
cornbread in the oven too long ?)  If so, you're just burning the cob at
the bottom, which might mean you didn't smoke your first few bowls all
the way down, and still haven't caked the bowl.

I replace mine when it becomes black and unattractive (rarely), or
more frequently, when I've chewed up the stem so badly it's no longer
smokeable, or even more frequently, when I lose it.

&gt;Again, sorry for
&gt;asking what is quite probably a silly question, but hey, what can I say?

Sorry, you only got permission to ask *one* question.  It would be against
my contract, therefore, to tell you what you can say.

<a name="3">Subject: Meerschaum musings and churchwarden chewings</a>

A friend of mine just gave me an antique meerschaum (by Hayim Pinhas
of Istanbul, if that means anything to anyone), which looks like it's
of 40s or 50s vintage, not smoked too much. It's a nice-looking pipe,
but I'd like to make sure that the pipe is thoroughly clean before I
smoke it. Does anyone here know how to disinfect a meerschaum? I
understand that hot alcohol is used for briars, but shudder at what
that would do to the beeswax (which is what causes the meerschaum to
acquire its color.) Ben Rapaport's "Guide to Collecting Antique Pipes"
gives some hints on cleaning, but nothing really on germ killing. (Of
course, I could just load it up with some Pipeworks "Churchill"
mixture, which is sufficient to eradicate all life downwind :-)

Also in the news this week, I'd mailed Tim West several weeks ago,
asking for a price quote and a paper design for a churchwarden, as
(hopefully) a reward for passing my Ph.D. exam in February. It looks
beautiful - a half-bent Danish-style stem, chopped mouth and shank,
oversize bowl, and several choices of stain (or lack thereof). A goal
worth working for!

And, yes, I've been enjoying a pipe while I study, which occupies most
of my time now. Nothing like a nice bowl of John David's "JD 24" to
make the data flow analysis go better. And it's a good thing I've got
a good collection of briars built up - just hope the tobak (and the
stems) hold out until exam time! Until then (or until the next
mailing),

	Hi.

	please include me in the mailgroup, and let me start off by asking
	any overseas members if they know of a source for Mullingar's
	Tobaccos? They used to be available in the US in the early '70's,
	and I especially enjoyed "Knockbrack". I wrote various overseas
	distributors, and the company itself, but no one could help me.
	Has anyone seen this? As I recall, it might be Scottish.

	Another (lost) source of enjoyment were S.S. Pierce pipes. Several
	of my favorite pipes were from that company. They all broke in nicely
	and mellowed with age. Many far more expensive pipes I've bought over
	the years have disappointed.

	I'll chat more later.

[ I've given my library a cursory look for Mullingar's, but I'll give
it a more thorough look a little later.  Welcome to the group, Brent! -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Puffing in Pursuit of a Ph.D.</a>

After many hours, many books, and many bowls of baccy, I managed to
pass my Ph.D. exam this week. Immense sigh of relief! I may actually
make it to the degree one of these days... (scuze me while I light up,
cause it ain't right to put the mailing together while I'm not
smoking!) As many of you who are also students surely know, a good
pipe helps improve concentration and attentiveness. Don't know why
this is, but I guess it works! :-)

As a reward, I'd promised myself a new pipe, of course. At Bill
Thacker's suggestion, I'd written to Tim West, a carver, around
December, and sent him a rough sketch of a "wizard pipe". Actually,
it's a large churchwarden with an egg-shaped bowl and a carved
push-fit (military) stem, rough top and saddle (where the stem fits),
and red/black stain finish. Tim's also going to include a shorter
Peterson-bit stem for travelling use. All this for about $65,
estimated He predicted it'd take him two or three weeks to carve - I
can't wait!

On related topics, on the front page of today's Central NJ "Home
News", is an article about a "smokers' rights" bill sponsored by
Assemblyman Willie Brown, D-Essex, which prevents employers from
discriminating against smokers when hiring or firing personnel. The
Senate sponsor, Francis McManimon, found it "offensive that the
companies might try to fire somebody just because he smoked on his
time off." (I agree!)

The article, like most such in the Home News, is basically
anti-smoking, and insinuates that Brown is sponsoring the bill due to
RJR contributions.  (Well, maybe just a little... :-) But it might
just be time to look up and write to a few legislators, so that yet
another of our rights doesn't get taken away. Remember, folks (with
apologies to Rick Hacker):

     O N L Y   O U T L A W S   W I L L   S M O K E   P I P E S !

But for now, enjoy! And, as always,

The reason is simple; insurance companies give them lower insurance
rates if they don't hire smokers, because they'll pay statistically
less benefits.

I wish people would distinguish between cigarette smokers and pipe/cigar
smokers in measures like this !

Re: Sublets, insurance, civil rights, and of course pipes...

I'm still checking the mailbox anxiously, Bill, but no package from
Columbus yet. In the meantime, I bought a nice little bent from an
Israeli company named Alpha last week - cost was $10 on a 50%-off
sale. It looks fine - has some Dremel work on the bowl which probably
hides sand pits, but no visible fills, and it's an interesting shape
(stem meets bowl about 1/3 of the way up.) So there still are bargains
to be had. (I got it at John David's in Quaker Bridge Mall, if anyone
in NJ wants to catch the sale.)

Also to our NJ population: I'm looking for a summer sublet near
Rutgers (but not in high-crime areas) where both I and my pipes would
feel welcome. If you have any leads, please let me know! (I 'm clean,
pay rent regularly, and don't live with a stereo, pet, or child :-)

Regarding the insurance question: I think you're absolutely right. And
in the future, we may expect to see companies performing pee tests for
nicotine, if they're not doing so already (gaah! more civil rights
down the tubes!) On the other hand, I read somewhere (think it was the
Ephemeris) that cigar and pipe smokers are still considered nonsmokers
for insurance purposes. But should it matter? Some people can smoke
cigarettes occasionally, without getting nastily hooked, and I don't
think they should have to pay the insurance either.

By the way, I heard a report on NPR (of all places!) about this
phenomenon. There seem to be two types of cigarette smokers - those
who smoke on certain fixed occasions (like after dinner), and those
who basically smoke "while they're awake." If anyone else heard the
report, I'd appreciate details. In either case, I'd venture to say
that very few cigar and pipe smokers are in the second category.

If you've heard any news on pipe smoking and legislation to
decriminalize it :-), please write in! Until next time, (which should
be sooner to this time than this time was to the last),

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

Got this little program a few days back that I thought you would possibly
be interested in...

Dunno if you have access to an Apple // or not, but the program is called
PICTOSAGA.  It's about Mr. Pictograph, who gets tired of just representing
numbers in charts for "people too stupid to read bar graphs," so he goes
out into the world to try and find out what it's all about.
Along the way, he meets the man whom you sent us the ascii picture of a
while back (Rev. Somethingorother from the Church of the Subgenius) and the
Rev. gives Mr. Pictograph a pipe.  Well, this pipe ends up being a great
help for Mr. P. as he encounters all kinds of nasty situations.

It was written years and years ago, but it's still very cute and the pipe-
will-conquer-all references is what I thought you'd get a smirk out of. If
you, or anyone else on the list for that matter, use or have access to an
Apple // (][+ and up), I'd be happy to pack it and send it out.

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
<a name="3">Subject: The Churchwarden Cometh</a>

Well, the Timwest Original finally arrived last week, and we've been
getting acquainted a little bit. As advertised, it's half-bent, with
an egg-shaped bowl and chopped lip and shank, and about twelve inches
of stem. There's a noticeable divot on the front of the bowl, but no
other surface flaws, and Tim didn't charge full price due to the
divot. The workmanship is generally good, though there are some minor
nits to pick (vise marks on the stem, and what may or may not be a
light point in the stain.)

I'm discovering some general facts about life with churchwardens, and
with this one in particular. First, you have to have a hand free to
smoke; the leverage on the teeth is just too much for hands-off
operation. Of course, you can just let the bowl rest on your chest (as
I'm doing now). Second, you _have_ to maintain a dry mouth, or that
long stem gets a case of gurgles. Churchwarden pipe cleaners are
available (Tim sold me a bundle for $1), though standard cleaners
miiiight just make it if you use one from either end of the stem.
Peculiar to this pipe is its large (7/8") bowl, so any smoke costs
about 1/4 ounce of tobacco. Of course, a bowl lasts over an hour,
which is great for reading! Tim didn't pre-carbonize the bowl, so it's
getting "broken in" in the old-fashioned way. All in all, an
interesting "specialty piece."

Also in the local news: I bought a small bent for my roommate, on the
theory that it was in my best interest to have another pipe smoker in
the apartment (crafty ;-) Actually, he wanted to try a pipe and seems
to enjoy it. Which brings up a point - if someone you know likes the
smell of a pipe, or is trying to get off cigs, why not do them a favor
and buy them a starter briar?  They'll appreciate it, and you'll be
helping the cause of pipedom from a grass-roots level.

Until next time, folks,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

&gt; 
&gt; Dunno if you have access to an Apple // or not, but the program is called
&gt; PICTOSAGA.  It's about Mr. Pictograph, who gets tired of just representing
&gt; numbers in charts for "people too stupid to read bar graphs," so he goes
&gt; out into the world to try and find out what it's all about.
&gt; Along the way, he meets the man whom you sent us the ascii picture of a
&gt; while back (Rev. Somethingorother from the Church of the Subgenius) and the
&gt; Rev. gives Mr. Pictograph a pipe.  Well, this pipe ends up being a great
&gt; help for Mr. P. as he encounters all kinds of nasty situations.

Yes, the Ascii picture is of J.R. "Bob" Dodds, founder of the Church of
Subgenius.  "Bob" (whose name is always quoted thusly) is the ultimate
Earthly avatar of Slack.  He is Slack incarnate.  In his mouth is held
"the true Pipe", in which he smokes "frop" to achieve his most Slackful
states.  He is destined to save Earth from the Xists, so that we may
all be re-united with our Yeti ancestry and become Overmen.

If the above sounds intriguing, you might want to pick up "The Book Of
Subgenius".  Ten smackeroos at better (if less tasteful) bookstores
near you 8-)

&gt; 
&gt; I'm discovering some general facts about life with churchwardens, and
&gt; with this one in particular. [...]

&gt; you _have_ to maintain a dry mouth, or that
&gt; long stem gets a case of gurgles. Churchwarden pipe cleaners are
&gt; available (Tim sold me a bundle for $1), though standard cleaners
&gt; miiiight just make it if you use one from either end of the stem.

You'll find that this leads to the buildup of a plug in the middle of the
stem, as pipe residue (aka "gunk") gets pushed inwards from both ends.

		    Pipes Digest #40 - May 5, 1990

From: Norm Carpenter &lt;????@??????.???.????????.???&gt;
<a name="2">Subject: hello,  pipecraft is the topic.</a>

Any pipe makers out there?  I've been dabbling at it for a little while now
(In between the honey-dos and what-nots).  I borrowed a miniature machine
lathe from my father that works pretty well.  Thanks to Steve I was able
to get the supplies and a convience tool (a tool that helps to make the
mortise and tenon for the stem) from PIMO inc.  I have made one pipe from
the handy dandy kit (We drilled the holes and fitted the stem for you).
This is rather boxy and not too pretty,  but I love it cause it is my first
pipe made by me.  I destroyed a briar block (please don't cry, we all need
to learn on something) cutting the stem on the lathe,  but the second block
turned (pardon the pun) out well.  I still need to clear the wood from the 
areas where the lathe can't get,  around the base of the shank and bowl.

Briar is a very hard wood and this task seems time consuming.   Anybody got
some good ideas?

Norm

[ Good going, Norm! Personally, I'd try a flex-shaft with a wood rasp
bit. Does anyone else have any help for Norm? -S. ]

[ Welcome, and excuse me while I light a GBD Canadian to contemplate
your question...that's more like it... :-) Of course, when you smoke
cigarettes, you're also smoking paper. There are also chemical
additives in cigarette tobacco to make it burn more evenly. Pipe
tobacco, on the other hand, typically contains flavorings and such.
In "The Ultimate Pipe Book", Richard Hacker mentions that "in the
United States... pipe tobacco is normally treated with chemical
additives such as diethylene glycol, sugar, glucose, and molasses as
agents to keep the tobacco moist and sweet smelling. These tobacco
additives are not allowed in Great Britain." Additionally, "casings",
or flavorings, are added.  Hacker gives "... chocolate, honey, rum,
cherry, apple, peach, banana, coffee, liquor, and a host of other
flavorings" as possible additives. From the health standpoint, it
seems you're best off smoking a pipe with unflavored English tobacco.
Additionally, pipes are, IMHO, more fun, more pleasant to nonsmokers,
and held in better regard than cigarettes. Let us know what you
decide! -S. ]

Dear Steve Masticola:
	I have been a pipe smoker for about two years now and enjoy it
very much.  I have a small assortment of pipes and am expanding my collection
almost constantly.  I also like to try out new and different blends of 
tobbaccos and keep a list of where I bought them, name, and characteristics.
I would like the chance to share my experiences with other and gain from
them their own experiences that may help inhance my own pipe-smoking pleasure.
	Thank you for your consideration.

[ Tom, I'm having trouble reaching your address. If any of our members
at UIUC could help out and forward this to horizon, I'd appreciate it.
If you have a chance to stop in at Jon's Pipe Shop (509 E. Green St.,
Champaign, IL), I've heard excellent reviews from all quarters, and
Jon is most gracious and accomodating. Hope I can stop in there this
summer myself! In any case, welcome, and we hope to hear more from
you! - S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: Pipes vs. Cigarettes</a>

?????@????.????.??? enquires:

&gt; BTW do you know what is healther smokeing camel filters or a pipe and not
&gt; inhaling.  (I currently smoke camels).
 
Camels are known to be quite carcinogenic, of course, when burned.
Plus, they almost always carry syphilis and other nasties.  If you
must smoke a desert animal, go with a Dromedary, they're cleaner.

As for cigarettes vs. pipes... I've always heard that pipes were much
safer so long as you don't inhale the smoke.  That avoids the two
biggest dangers associated with cigarette smoking, lung cancer and
heart disease.  (And I'll add that pregnant mothers could probably
safely smoke pipes, as well)

Past that, considerations of which smoke is more harmful are purely
secondary.  It might be safer to smoke cigarettes than a pipe if you
inhale neither, but not many people do that. After all, why smoke
w/out inhaling if not for the taste ?


And our Most Referential Sponsor, Steve Masticol, cites:

&gt; In "The Ultimate Pipe Book", Richard Hacker mentions that "in the
&gt; United States... pipe tobacco is normally treated with chemical
&gt; additives such as diethylene glycol, sugar, glucose, and molasses as
&gt; agents to keep the tobacco moist and sweet smelling. These tobacco
&gt; additives are not allowed in Great Britain." Additionally, "casings",
&gt; or flavorings, are added.  Hacker gives "... chocolate, honey, rum,
&gt; cherry, apple, peach, banana, coffee, liquor, and a host of other
&gt; flavorings" as possible additives. 

The British are such snobs about such things.  The implication is
that while we Yanks are perverting nature by adding such artificial
nasties as sugar, glucose, and molasses, it's perfectly fine to 
toss in flavorings of chocolate (mostly sugar), honey, fruit, and
distilled spirits.  

Of course, the Germans got even with them.  Beer drinkers are well aware
of the German Rhineheitsgebot, a law which requires that beer may be only
be produced using barley, hops, water, and yeast, a requirement met by
very few British (or American) beers.  And so it happened that when a
British embassy in Germany tried to import a quantity of Guinness for
a party, the German customs officials refused to admit it, claiming
that "we're not sure what it is, but it certainly isn't beer."

It was after all the English who introduced tobacco to the western
world, and as such we can be *snobbish* about these things.  Most of the decent
pipe tobacco available in England is imported from the Netherlands, although
there are many specialist shops catering for the needs of the more
discerning smoker.

&gt; Of course, the Germans got even with them.  Beer drinkers are well aware
&gt; of the German Rhineheitsgebot, a law which requires that beer may be only

&gt; that "we're not sure what it is, but it certainly isn't beer."
&gt; 
 
The problem here is one of semantics.  While the americans associated beer
with some cold fizzy liquid, we English mean ALE.  Lager is the usual term
used in the UK for what the Germans refer to as beer (and they even drink it
chilled).  For your information, Guinness is a *stout* and not a *beer*
and it is not brewed in the UK, but in the Irish Republic (Eire).  This
would explain why the germans correctly identified that it was certainly not
beer,
it was not even ale.

Respectfully,

Andrew J. Chipperfield.

		 Pipes Digest #45 - September 2, 1990

From: Andy Chipperfield &lt;????@????.??????.??.??&gt;
<a name="2">Subject: Re: pipes vs cigarettes</a>

Just a short note about my recent experiences of pipe smoking vs cigarettes.

Having been a cigarette smoker for about 7 years, catching colds every 
year, and having to put up with continual price rises (a pack of 20
Benson and Hedges costs 180 pence (sterling)(nearly $3 US)), I decided 
to try to give up the cigarettes and just smoke pipes. 
(for comparison a 25g pack of Clan tobacco cost around 135 pence)

Some observations:

- people who have never before complained about smoking have now done so.
- I am now unable to smoke during the day at work.
- the follow on effect from above is that by the time I get home to my
pipe (which is very difficult to light in a car in moving traffic),
I am so desperate for a smoke that I dont enjoy it.

The net result is that now I get little or no enjoyment out of my 
pipe smoking.  I have lapsed back into smoking cigarettes during 
the day and the situation with the pipe is beggining to improve.

The question:

Has anybody else come across this prejudice of pipes, or suffered
in the same way when trying not to smoke cigarettes?

Keep on puffing,

Andy Chipperfield.

[ I smoke my pipe in the car all the time, Andy - the key is doing the
critical operations at stoplights. Hope some of our other readers can
comment on their experiences regarding pipe vs. cigarette smoking at
work... - S. ]

Re: A new pipe magazine; a pleasant English tobacco

Well, summer is over and the real "pipe season" is soon to begin. Here
at Pipes Newsgroup Plaza (sorry, Tom &amp; Ray :-), we have a couple of
pleasant news items to report, over a small Peterson loaded with John
David's "African", and a glass of iced tea. Join us now, as we write:

Last week, I received a copy of "The Compleat Smoker", a new quarterly
magazine for the pipe and cigar lover. It looks much more professional
than the (now defunct) "Pipe Smoker and Tobacciana Trader" - all
articles are well-written and the photography is good.  Feature
articles include:

	"Of Shanks and Stems - The Bridge between Smoker and Tobacco"
	"The Thinking Man's Pipe: The Peterson Story"
	"Tobacco and the Tsar"
	"Wrapping it Up: Judging a Cigar by its Cover"
	"The Quest for Briar"
	"Are we Looking through the Surgeon General's Smoke Screen?"
	"The Charring Light"

The cover painting by Anisa Nedzelnyitskaya is also most attractive!
Tom Dunn, Rick Hacker, and Ben Rappaport have all lent endorsements to
the mag. Write for a copy, or a 1-year subscription ($17.50) to:

	The Compleat Smoker
	P.O. Box 7036
	Evanston, IL 60201

I did - and your editor is never (well... hardly ever :-) wrong!

Also, I've recently picked up a couple of cans of "After Hours", a
mild English tobacco by Lane Ltd. Very nice smoke, tasty and no tongue
bite. The price ($7 for a 4 oz. tin) is a bit off-putting, but you
might manage to find it discounted as I did (but not at the same
store, since I bought out their stock). 

In the same sale, I got a 2-oz. can of Robert McConnell's "Red
Virginia Superb", which I found a bit harsh. Oh well, you can't win
'em all!

Until next time,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

&gt; Subject: Re: pipes vs cigarettes
&gt; 
&gt; - people who have never before complained about smoking have now done so.

I'm unfamiliar with the blend you're referring to, but in general, I find
that people who object to pipe smoke do so for one of two reasons:

a) They object to all smoke, either because of allergies, health concerns,
	or general contrariness
b) You're smoking something that smells bad.

I smoke a deep, dark cavendish; very moist, very aromatic.  It smells
good.  For every complaint I get (either a) or b) above) I average about
three compliments.

Most smokers seem to abandon the aromatics for English blends; I've tried
them from time to time, and have never cared for them.  I did observe,
though, that when flirting with these tobaccos I started getting comments
from friends and aquaintances of the sort "Say, did you change tobaccos ?"
As these were invariably accompanied by frowns, I took it that the change
was not appreciated 8-)

&gt; - I am now unable to smoke during the day at work.

While IMHO even the worst-smelling pipeweed is twice better than 
cigarette smoke, the smell of the pipe is much more pervasive.   I 
suppose this is why pipes (and cigars) are not allowed on airplanes,
even when cigarettes are permitted.  Again, a change to a more pleasant-
smelling tobac might solve this problem.

&gt; - the follow on effect from above is that by the time I get home to my
&gt; pipe (which is very difficult to light in a car in moving traffic),
&gt; I am so desperate for a smoke that I dont enjoy it.

Do you inhale the smoke, or just "mouth" it ?   I smoke fairly heavily,
but not at work.  While I especially miss the taste right after lunch,
I never find myself desperate for a smoke.  In fact, I have at times gone
"cold turkey" for as long as a week (nothing like taking a business trip
and forgetting to bring your briar!) with no adverse affects; had I been
at all desperate, I could easily have picked up a corncob at any
drugstore.

As for the car, you have two choices:  

a) use cruise control and steer with your knees (this is quite do-able
on highways, for instance)

b) fill and light before you pull out of your parking space.

If you use a lighter, as opposed to matches, one-handed lighting in the
car is no trouble.

&gt; Has anybody else come across this prejudice of pipes

The only prejudice I've noticed about pipes is that people classify
you as an intellectual (unless you're smoking a cob, in which case,
you're a hillbilly 8-)   I can live with that 8-)

   Hello,
   I am Hoang. I just know about this group and subscribe it right away.
I have been smoking for a long time, but I just found the enjoyment of
pipe smoking. Here, I found this group.
   I really want make cigarette to my own taste. As a newcomer, I would like 
to ask if any of you could help me by pointing me to the right place to find
the techniques to make cigarette, tobacco blending, ... (books, brochure or
whatever is useful)

   Thanks in advance,

   Hoang

information on rolling one's own? - S. ]

I've, err...well, I quit smoking. ;-)   I've got ulcer problems,
and while the pipe-smoking is psychologically relaxing, the tobacco
induces acid secretions that aren't very good for me.  So as much as
I've enjoyed it, I've given it up.  I've packed everything away in
case I want to take it up again in 5 or 10 years...but for now, it's
probably better for me to refrain from my favorite vice. ;-)

BTW, having gone through (1) quitting smoking and (2) cutting out caffeine,
I can say that (2) is *much* harder.  I still get headaches from not
having enough caffeine!

Thanks, and pleasant smoking!
Rich

[ Rich won't be getting this mail, of course, but it was a nice
letter, so I decided to put it in anyway. Perhaps one of our other
members could comment about pipe smoking, stomach trouble, and ways to
insure that the twain never meet? Hope we can hear from you again
someday, Rich! -S. ]

Re: A few pipeish notes

The holiday season has come, and for most of us has gone. Like some
lucky individuals, it left a few pipes in its wake...

While at the local Tinder Box, I bought a $1 special ("Imported Briar"
[as opposed to the domestic kind, which doesn't grow here anyway :-],
large router marks in an unsuccessful attempt to hide splits in the
grain). It's a small billiard shape, something I haven't posessed
before, and it's working out well. At the price, I don't care too
much... :-) While at a restaurant, I persuaded my friend Diane (an
inveterate cigarette smoker) to try a puff - reaction: "This is
_nice_!" Next trip to the pipe shop, I'll try to find another dollar
special for her too! My parents also got me a nice rough-surface
Peterson. I really like them - you can chomp down and not worry about
the stem too much.

Also, we got into the _Ephemeris_! (Although Tom spelled the mail
address slightly wrong, anyone with net experience should be able to
figure it out.) I'm _still_ waiting to get issue #2 of _The Compleat
Smoker_, and will write to the publisher before the postage goes up
again. Has anyone else heard from these people?

On the down side, it seems that two of my present roommates are moving
out, and at least one of the guys moving in seems to be an antismoker.
I've decided that next year I'm going to actively hunt for fellow pipe
smokers to dorm with. Any input from the Rutgers contingent would be
most welcome!

In the meantime, hope you enjoyed Christmas, preferably with the stump
of a pipe held tight in your teeth, and the smoke encircling your head
like a wreath... :-) Until next time,

					Smoke in peace,
					~\U Steve.

From: ????????????@??????.??????.??? (Elias Mazur)
<a name="2">Subject: I'm still alive...</a>


Hello everybody,

   After a veeryy loong period away from the pipe mailgroup, due to unstable
computer accounts, I'm happily back.  I've kept up with the pipe digests by
logging into my previous account, but since it was a long distance call away
from me, I barely had time to read the message without going bankrupt.
Remember, I have to buy pipes too :-).

  Anyway, I am happy that the group that I had the honor to have started along
with Steve is well, alive and smoking (hopefully a nice English blend - no
flames, I'm not smoking now :-) . Hopefully now I will be able to be more
active in the mailgroup, since apparently I got a fairly stable account in one
of our clients.

  In this past year that I was absent of the group, I have acquired a number
of pipes, which of course would take a long time to list them and talk about
all of them now.  The one I would like to mention is a full bent pipe bought
at the Connoisseur (remember Steve) in NYC.  It is a very nice pipe with a
bird's eye grain.  I mentioned this pipe because the person in the pipe store
(the same one when me and Steve were there almost two years ago) told me that
the shape, a full bent, was named after a South African general who wanted a
pipe that would be easy to hold in the mouth while giving orders in the battle
field, and whose name I have forgot (unfortunately !!!).  Anyway, if someone
knows more about it, please share with us.  I will try to find out more about
it myself.  It was also my X-mas pipe, since part of the money to purchase the
pipe came from a gift certificate given to me. It would be nice to hear from
everybody about any X-mas pipes bought and/or received as X-mas presents.

  Inspired by the shape of this pipe, together with the fact that I am working
in a workstation running X windows, I have created a nice bitmap to be used as
the root cursor.  I am sending the file with the bitmap and instructions to
Steve and if someone has a workstation with X windows, send Steve mail and he
can send to you .  Sorry Steve, I don't want to give more you work, but I
figured would be easier in terms of e-mail addressing to contact you.  Anyway,
I hope those of you who got X windows will enjoy the nice pipe cursor.

  Continuing with my catching up of old pipe digests, I remember recently a
message in which we had the sad note of Rich Kulawiec, who unfortunately had to
quit (aarrgghh !! what a terrible word...) smoking his pipe.  He says in his
message that he had ulcer and had to quit (aarrrgghh !!!).  When I begun to
smoke pipes and really started to enjoy it fully, I got concerned about the
possibility of an ulcer over a long period of time.  The solution I found for
myself was to drink milk on a VERY regular basis.  I like milk a lot, so I had
no problem.  I usually drink a glass of milk after my night pipe at home.  It
may be a little empirical, but it also may work.

  Finally I want to thank Steve for keeping up with the pipes digest which,
like a pipe itself, gives all of us a moment of tranquility.

- Elias Mazur

[ Good to have you back, Elias! I believe the general's name was Oom
  Paul; I have one of his pipes too (from Savinelli). Can I forward
  your posting to Rich? -S. ]

Instructions:

  1) save the first bitmap in a file called 'bigpipe'
  2) save the second bitmap in a file called 'bigpipeMask'
  3) give the command:

     xsetroot -cursor bigpipe bigpipeMask -fg black -bg brown

  4) enjoy the pipe...

		 Pipes Digest #49 - February 3, 1991


From: ????@??????.???.????????.??? (Norm Carpenter)

Hello,

How has everybody been?  I did not get a new pipe for xmax but I did get
a very nice xmas present from my brother-in-law.  He went to a couple of 
different tobacco stores and bought about 5 different blends.  Put them
all in a box along with some matches.  It was great.  I don't smoke too
much (in California anything that smokes is considered evil) but about
one or two bowls a day makes me happy.  I currently have all the tobacco
still in plastic bags and in the refrigerator.  Is this a good place to keep
it or should I put it someplace else?

I currently have one pipe that I use almost exclusively.  I know this is not
a good idea.  But I just enjoy smoking this pipe more than others.  I'll
look around for some specials (the budget currently does not allow for
classics).  Till next mail,  keep in touch.

Norm

I've worked in computers for a few years now,  but I still can't believe
how these things work.  The message you just sent to 13 seconds to get 
here.  From NY!  anyhow,  add my latest to the next digest.  I,  like
Elias,  look as much forward to the pipes digest as a new pipe.  It
really kicks my day of great to see the masticol header in my mail box.
Keep up the good work.  

Norm

[ Glad to provide the service, Norm, and we're always glad to hear

of politicking in the next entry... -S. ]

Re: Soapbox mode ON!

Many of the readers in other states may have heard of Jim Florio, the
governor of New Jersey who became spectacularly unpopular after
raising the state sales tax last year. I was willing to forgive him
this; it seems right to pay for what we get from government. However,
I won't forgive what he did this week. He vetoed a piece of
legislation which would have prohibited discrimination against hiring
those who choose to smoke in our own homes. That means us, folks.

We have to face the fact that we're losing ground against the
antismokers. I'm not talking about the people who are uncomfortable
around tobacco; many are, and I'm perfectly willing to be polite. I'm
speaking of our self-appointed moral guardians who don't want anyone
smoking. Anything. Ever.

Now, I'm no great fan of the cigarette companies either; they've done
a lot of things that are morally shoddy, and that's a fact. But I
firmly believe that, as an adult, I am capable of taking care of my
own health and my own morality. Florio and his ilk say that we am not
our own best moral guardians. They say that some company should have
the power to regulate what we may do on our own time and in our own
homes. I regard this as a profoundly un-American attitude.

Like many of you, I choose to smoke a pipe. We must also, it seems,
choose to defend our right to do so without harassment. This I will
do, and I encourage others to join me. Even if you don't live in New
Jersey, antismoking discrimination is on the rise and will affect you
too, sooner or later. We must defend our rights or lose them.

For those who would like them, here are some smokers' rights groups
listed in the _Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris_. I'll be writing to some of
these and will let you know the results.

Grass-roots groups:

	American Smokers' Alliance

	Nashville, TN 37203
	
	Smokers Unite

	Canada

	American Pipe and Accessory League
	Cano Ozgener, President
	4121 Hillsboro Road
	Suite 209
	Nashville, TN 37215

Industry sponsored groups:

	P.O. Box 453
	Winston-Salem, NC 27102

	Smoker's Advocate - National Edition
	A service of Philip Morris U.S.A.
	P.O. Box 96599

	Smokers' Caucus
	A service of Philip Morris U.S.A.

Also, write for a 56 page manual on public issues and protecting your rights:

	Consumer Affairs Department
	Philip Morris U.S.A.
	120 Park Avenue
	New York, NY 10017


However you choose to do so, I hope you'll help, so that we can
continue to

<a name="2">Subject: Re:  PIPES DIGEST REQUEST</a>

 Thanks.  I don't want to see the list go political, and would hate to be
the agent of that change, so please use your judgement.  I might rather that
you simply say:

  David Chesler (now ???????@?????.???.???) replies that he is ambivalent
about the failure of the New Jersey anti-discrimination for smokers act
to pass.  On the one hand he dislikes Big Tobacco and believes addicted
cigarette smokers do use a disproportionate amount of health care and
sick days; on the other hand he doesn't like Big Brother coming into
his house (but also doesn't want Big Brother in his private employment
contract either) and finds pipe smokers to face worse discrimination,
for less reason, than cigarette smokers.

  - David

[ Note to the perplexed: I received some correspondence from David and
asked him if I could post it. This was his reply. I'd agree with it in
some points, the main one being that I'd rather not see the mailgroup
get involved in political harangues (and probably shouldn't have
encouraged such discussions in the first place). For more pipely
activities, read on. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Clay Pipes?</a>

I'm glad to see the Digest alive and kicking, again.

Question, to the world at large:  I've just acquired a couple of
clay pipes, one with a long stem, and one short.  Is there anything
I should be particularly aware of, before smoking them?  Do they
break-in as briars do?  Should I do anything special?

I have a couple of pipes with ceramic bowls, but I've never tried
smoking either of them.  One has an incredibly elaborate carved
ebony stem, more than a meter in length, with mother-of-pearl inlays
and a flexible tube connecting bit to stem.  It's Danish, and my
father acquired it because it was like the pipes he remembers old
men smoking during his childhood in turn-of-the-century Denmark. 
The other belonged to my great-grandfather, is apparently American,
and has a ceramic joint that connects the ceramic bowl to the
unpeeled stem.  It, too has a flexible connection to the bit.

The new pipes are much simpler, and strongly resemble illustrations
I've seen in 18th- and early 19th-century publications.  Any help
would be appreciated.

Hi! 
I have a question for you pipe smokers.  How old were you when you
started smoking a pipe?  Did you start smoking a pipe, or did you
switch from cigarettes or cigars?  
I don't smoke right now, but have always been curious to try smoking 

a pipe...so I am curious how others got started.  THanks -- will

[ I'll answer briefly Will - hope some others will too. I remember
sneaking off to the woods to smoke a homemade pipe at the ripe old age
of eight; bought my first "real" pipe at age 15. Still have it; don't
smoke it much these days. Never cared much for cig*s.

If you're curious about pipes, why not go to a tobacconist and ask for
a good-quality starter set? Ask him or her (or us) to give you some
pointers about how to smoke your pipe for better enjoyment. Most of us
really like it! - S. ]

From: ????@??????.???.????????.??? (Norm Carpenter)
<a name="2">Subject: When I started</a>


I started smoking in college.  There is something about a pipe that lends
itself to a quiet and relaxing moment which is just what I needed from time
to time during the college days.  I stopped for a few years when my daughter
was born but went back to the pipe.  I usually smoke only one or two bowls 
a day and if I try two in a row I can start to get dizzy after all these
years.  I'll go for a few days without a pipe (which actually makes the next
light *very* enjoyable).  If you know someone who smokes a pipe then you should
get together with him to light.  You can ask questions and discuss preferences.
As with anything worthwhile it takes a little practice to get the most pleasure
from your pipe.  Knowing the right feel of the load,  how to light,  keeping
an even burn,  and good pipe maintenance are all a part of enjoying your pipe.

Well enough is enough,  I sound like an ad for RJR.  Hope you get as much or
more pleasure from your pipe as I did from mine.  Steve,  I still have my
first 'real' pipe (not bought from the drug store) and I keep it in the 
office of emergency situations. 

P.S.  Does anybody know the situation with Andre's pipe shop.  I visited
him once and meant to go back and buy a pipe while he was there crafting
but I never did.  The shop I believe was destroyed during the '89 quake
and I would like to know if he started up again?

	Steve, a while back there was an issue dealing with the
availability and location of "strike-anywhere" matches.  Where might I
find them? 

	Also, to the pipes in general: What's the "life-span" of tobacco?

Oh, a propos (french for man -k :-), what are the opinions of the group co
concerning &gt;hand-rolled&lt; cigarettes?

					-rick.

[ Sorry, Rick, but I really don't think those matches are made
anymore! (Other members, please correct me if I'm wrong.) As for the
"life-span" of tobacco, it can be re-humidified if it dries out - just
place a moist wad of paper towel on top, and mix it around carefully
(so as not to crumble it into dust!) every 12 hours or so. Repeat
until it's properly moist, but not too wet - about like when it came
new. I've revived some "sale" tabak that way. I'll let other members
answer about the hand rolled cigs, having no opinion myself. -S. ]

In answer to will thomas' question (Mr. Moderator: please summarize this
for me, do y'all want to hear all the details of all the stories?) about
when I first smoked a pipe:
 Within a few weeks of starting college, age 17, I bought a cheap pipe and
some tobacco at the local tobacconist, and tried to learn how to smoke it.
I eventually bought some pipe-smokers' guidebook, and acquired a few Dr.
Grabow's.  My roommates were not too happy (especially the asthmatic) because
we were in that dorm because we were non-smokers (well I wasn't one when I
filled out the rooming form!).  We adopted some compromise after he stuck
my pipe in the freezer.  (Another roommate figured "smoke?" meant tobacco,
and since he only smoked marijuana answered "no", leading to all sorts of
goings-on.)
 My father gave me my first cigarette at about age 5, and as he predicted
I wasn't particularly curious through my teens, and never really picked
up habitually cigarette smoking.  I stayed up the night before a final
my first term in college, studying and chain-smoking Carlton's, then
overslept and gave up both of those habits, although I still smoke a
Turkish Special every few months, particularly in bars and clubs, and
will bum a cigarette during times of high stress.  (I currently only
smoke pipes on ocassion, usually outdoor things like football games and
hikes.)
 BTW my father had "always" owned a pipe, and every few years at my
mother's urging grew a beard, lit up a bowl, and posed for a picture,
but he is basically a non-smoker.

"Strike anywhere match" = Ohio Blue Tip.  I haven't looked, but I'm sure
as recently as five years ago I saw them at a supermarket.  I prefere
a butane lighter.

Hand-rolled cigarettes:
  Rolling is as much fun, and more mysterious, than filling a pipe. 
Georgopolous (NYC) sells tobaccos for that purpose as well.  Personally
I never got the hang of it.  Hand-rolled cigarettes are supposed to cost
half as much as store-bought (I think I read this on a bag in a drug
store) but you smoke so little that the tobacco gets stale [*] then it
doesn't matter either way.
  Many folks will assume a hand-rolled cigarette is a joint.

[*] Lifespan:
  Water is only one factor, the aromatic oils will also evaporate, probably
more so with flavored tobaccos (rum, whiskey, mango, cherry, etc).  I have
an inexpensive humidor jar (looks like a small glass cookie-jar with a clay
piece in the top I fill with water when I think of it.)  There are also
metal cases with that porous clay in it to put in a pouch.  I think I read
that pouches preserve the tobacco much more poorly than do jars, and should
not be used for long-term storage.  For me if I have any tobacco left after
a year or so I toss it - gives a good excuse to visit the tobacconist :-)
  Pipo (the Turkish State Monopoly's pipe brand) is imported nearly dry in
steel cans that rust.  It has to be humidified before smoking.
  What do freezers do to tobacco?  I bought a second pack of cigarettes that
I won't smoke for a while, and hermetically sealed it in cellophane
and aluminum foil, and put it in the deep freeze.  I haven't defrosted it yet.
Was this a smart move?

Thanks for the quick response!

I got my first pipe with $3.49 the first year I was in the US
as a graduate student.  The pipe was to be my company for the
long hours of study.  There were not many smokers around, so
I did not really appreciate pipe smoking that much.

We, my wife and I, came back to Taiwan three and half years ago
to teach.  I somke pipes occasionally and joined the pipe club
here in Taipei.  We gather about every other month in a JAPANESE
resturant and have Japanese food while puffing.  But it was not until
some three weeks ago when I finished reading Hacker's THE book
that I started to appreciate the meaning and pleasure of pipe
smoking.  In addition to TPSE, I also asked for a few other
publications about pipes.
Currently I own about 20 pipes, most of which were bought in
the US.  None are expensive; the most expensive one cost me $30.
However, I am in the process of acquiring a few pipes of better
quality and would very much like to have the input from you and
the others.

Really glad to get in touch with you.  I shall smoke in peace!

<a name="3">Subject: Here am I...</a>

Hello there!

This is my little introduction of myself. I'll also take the
opportunity to ask the rest of you a couple of beginner's
questions.

The first pipe I bought (which is still the only I've owned) was a
straight stemmed, simple one (I think the model is called apple or
billiards...). That was in 1987, when I was 20. I didn't smoke it
until a month later when I and my wife (then fiancee) were in London.
In London I bought 50 grammes of Old London Sweet Cut at G. Smith &amp;
Sons at Charing Cross Road in a round metal box.  I smoked that
tobacco during our stay in London, but then my smoking habits were
about nonexistent until this January (I bought a small pouch of Borkum
Riff in '88, but it got so old and dry and I didn't get it moist
again...).  So, in the middle of January this year I went to a local
tobacconist and bought a pouch of Borkum Riff, which I smoked
contently during the month it lasted (I'm very modest in my smoking
habit). The Borkum Riff didn't last longer than to the end of
February, so this Saturday I bought my next tobacco experience: Mac
Baren's Plumcake. During the few days I've smoked this tobacco (which
I find most inspiring, by the way) I've started to considered buying
another pipe, and perhaps an additional brand of tobacco... or two.
This is the state-of-my-pipe-hobby.

Now, the questions. When I bought that first tobacco in G. Smith &amp;
Sons in London I also found a small pamphlet published by the
Pipesmoker's Council (UK). It's from that little pamphlet that I've
gathered all I know about tobacco and pipe smoking (I even read about
how to light the pipe! which now is quite easy... but then it
wasn't!). Well, I realize there must be loads of books published on
the subject of pipe smoking and tobaccoes. What I need to know is
which ones are good and which publisher published them.

Secondly, I've read about a tobacco described as "rum-soaked perique".
Do any of you listers know of a brand even remotely similiar to this
description?

Hope any of you can answer both or one of my questions! Post here or
to me directly (depending on the tradition of the list).

Best,
/andreas

Sorry that this reply is so late, but things is a bit hectic this a' ways. :)

Well, the Ohio Blue Tip Matches still are being made.  Just got some not
even 2 weeks ago.  I don't know what exactly to do if your local stores
aren't stocking them.  The most I can give you is the address:

Universal Match Corp.
Kenner, LA  70062-7096

Also, as for my story...  Well, there's not really anything really interesting
to tell.  I've seen a very small number of people smoking pipes who seemed
quite happy with it (being not only a "habit," but a hobby also.)  So, when
I had a couple o' extra bucks in my pocket, I bought a Dr. Grabow corn-cob &amp;
a pack of cherry tobacco (can't remember the brand offhand.)  I liked it alot.
A lot of friends of mine saw I was having fun and couldn't stand it so they
went out and bought their own.  Now there's a small pack of younger persons
running around this small town of mine all clad in demin and leather and
whatnot with nice (not expensive, but nice nonetheless) pipes hanging out
of their maws.  An interesting picture, at least in my mind.  Well, I continue
to smoke a pipe because, as most others have stated, it lends itself well
to quiet contemplation or a relaxing moment (and this is most welcome while
in the middle of a compiler design class. :)  I only own two pipes (a replace-
ment corn cob, and a Grabow Grand Duke.)  When some money starts coming my
way, no doubt I'll be purchasing more &amp; more.

Well, I suppose that's all I have to say.  Thanx for the time to say it.

From: ????????@????????.??????

Steve,

Thanks for the interesting mess.  Now I got a problem for you.
Two days ago I was using a quality Castello and managed to have
the mouthpiece broken.  I learned from the expensive lesson that one should
never try to pull out the mouthpiece while smoking a pipe.
I am in the process of finding a place to have it repaired.  There
is no repair shop here in Taiwan.  I would like to send it to the US for
repair.  I know both Levin Pipes and Connoisseur Pipe Shop do repair
works but have no idea which one is more reliable.  Would your give me
some advice on this matter, provided that this won't cause too much
trouble for you.  I thank you in advance.

                                            Sean 5/3/91

[ No trouble at all, Sean; always glad to create an interesting mess!
I've never used either Levin or Connoisseur for repairs; the last few
I've had done have been from:

	Pipes Unlimited
	19 Auburn Ave.
	Utica, NY 13501

Stem repairs run about $8.50. Elias uses this shop as well; I've had
quite good results with them. -S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: To Humidify?</a>

As a dedicated, very-low-volume pipe smoker, I struggle almost
constantly with drying tobacco.  I would love to hear from the
Company At Large their successful strategies for rehumidifying good
tobacco gone dry, and for keeping it at it proper degree of
moistness.  Thanks, all ...

From: ????????@????????.??????

Steve,

Thank you so much for the info.  I have sent the Castello and an
Alfa for repair.

A few pieces of information that may be of interest to you and the
members out there.

The Pipe Club of Taiwan, Taipei Division just had another meeting
a few days ago.  It was again in a Japanese resturant.  Some ten
members showed up, some with their spouses.  Considering the wrestling
in our Congress and the street demonstrations which you might have
seen in the SPORTS section of your evening news, the turn-out rate was
OK.  We wined and dined for a couple of hours, then an informal contest
was held.  The winner kept his pipe lit for about 89 minutes, a
respectable record.  The Chairperson made it a goal to be at least
the second runner-up in the next International Pipe Smoking Contest.
(Our club sent a delegation to Japan last year and finished 4th.)

A few grad students here asked me where to buy a pipe and get
started.  I have yet to asked them whether it is because they
like me or it is because they like the smell of pipe tobacco I brought
with me into the classroom that they want to join the world of mature
men.  I gave each of them a beginner's pipe of sort (below $10 ea.)
and some tobacco.  Judging from the way they carry themselves (and their
pipes), I guess other grad students will come to be before long.
The prudent thing for me to do, I gather, is to make available free
order lists of companies like LePeltier, Levin...instead of free pipes.

Speaking of LePeltier, I have to add one more note.  I mail-ordered
clay pipes from him for a couple of times and found out that we have
a mutual friend here in Taiwan.  The world is quite small after all.

Fianlly, do you have any idea about the ingrediants of the sweeterners?
It is fairly difficult and therefore expensive to get sweeterners here.
I wonder if it is just a pipe dream to get a chemical supplies store
to put up a bottle of homemade sweeterner?


                                          Sean
                                          5/11/91

[ Thanks for the update, Sean! I believe sweeteners mostly have an
alcohol base, but don't know what else they put into them.  A little
150-proof rum might work quite well. :-) -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: trip to NewMexico</a>

Hello,
since I am on the list for about one year and just booked my 1st
trip to leave europe heading for NewMexico in June, it might be 
interesting to ask some questions:

  Does anyone know about interesting sites for  "pipe smokers"
  in or around NewMexico ?
  I will have a car for 1 week of spare time time from Albuquerque.

  Of course I would like to get a useful souvenir.
  I am thinking of a pipe from the local Indians: 
  Do they have any pipe tradition ?
  Of course I would like to have a fully useable pipe, not just
  a tourist's dummy.
  What do I have to pay attention to when buying a pipe or tobaco ?
  Is it maybe dangerous for an average european organism to use
  a certain tobaco or else products in NewMexico ?
  also with respect to the climate.

  What is the climate in NewMexico of June ?

  I need some US american vocabulary concerning pipes.
  "pipe smoker", f.i. is literally from german.
  Meanwhile I know about the different use of 'pipe'.
  Perhaps s.o. could tell me a few expressions by describing 
  a tobaco pipe in its parts, and the words one needs when talking
  about pipe smoking. F.i. what do you call the 'white fog' produced
  when smoking: fog, smoke, smog, steam or .... ?

Finnally some personal data, so you know who is asking:
In December I graduated in Radio-astrophysics in Bonn, FRG.
In January I was 27 yrs.
Since March I study/work for a Ph.D. in Radio-Astronomy, what will
last some 3 years.
Last month I bought a handmade pipe (after a Stanwell model) from my 
local dealer, with respect to my graduation. (A very common way to
justify a new pipe if considering the mail to this list :-)
Now I am looking forward to check Columbus' hypothesis about
disks and balls in space (never been out of europe).
And I like this $15.- tobacos (per 50gr.) which I cant afford  :(

Best wishes from Bonn, FRG

Martin

[ Wow, that's a lot of questions, Martin! I'll answer a few: (a) yes,
there are several Indian pipe ceremonies (don't know much about them);
(b) whether you like them :-); (c) depends on whether it's the variety
known as "Mexican laughing tobacco", which can cause serious
incarceration :-) :-) ; (d) if the European organism wants to use the
climate to cure a case of dry skin, forget it :-) :-) :-) (e) hot, I'd
think, but I've never been there; (f) how about: bowl, shank, stem,
bit, ferrule, tenon, keel, mainsail, yardarm :-)^4 (f) "smoke" will do
in most cases - an exception is "fallout" for when you light yp a bowl

Steve,

   Due to the short time between now and my trip (my fault, I kept postponing
such an important message...), I would appreciate if you could forward this
message to the group as soon as possible.

-----

Hello,

  I have a request for the group.  I will be going to South of Germany, more
precisely a town called Germisch about one hour south of Munich, for a
conference, and then will be spending a few days in Vienna, by the end of this
week.  If any of you out there in Europe have any suggestions or pointers to
good pipe shops in the area, I would appreciate to learn about it.  Sorry for
the short notice, but things have been pretty hectic at my work.

  Hope to hear from you guys in Europe.  I just read the message from Martin in
Bonn, Germany.

   Anyway, I will report any pipe exciting adventure in Europe to the group.

- Elias

[ I was out of town on vacation, but here it is! Sorry, I can't help
you out myself, but perhaps some of our European members could. Were
it Denmark, I'd send you to Larsen's in Copenhagen. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: A&amp;M Gazette, DC pipe show</a>

I've wanted for some time to pass on word of the Agricultural and
Mechanical Gazette, published by Neil Murray (47758 Hickory, Apt.
22305, Wixom, MI 43893 - a bit heavy on the 5-digit numbers, I'll
admit! :-) Neil gave us a mention in his April '91 issue - perhaps
some of our new subscribers found out about the group through this
tome! For only a few dollars a year, this enjoyable bimonthly pub
(possibly the most frequent in pipedom) offers a good list of pipe
club activities, shows and swap meets, and their unique "Dirigible
Pirates" serial, which is better read than described! Send Neil a
letter for all the facts.

Also, in the Spring 1991 issue of the Compleat Smoker, we learn of the
Pipe Collectors' International Convention and Pipe Show at the Crystal
Gateway Marriott, Arlington, VA. The show goes on from May 24-26.
Would go if I could, but my car has other plans - something to do with
its brakes :-( Hope this isn't too late to let some of you know!

Just returned from a trip to California, and was astonished by the
level of smoker-bashing there. The restaurants and hotels that permit
smoking are apparently required by law to display a fairly obnoxious
sign to the effect that if you patronize the place, you'll succumb
immediately to the effects of the evil weed. Personally, I'm no great
supporter of smoking in restaurants, but those bits of state-enforced
propaganda made me appreciate the relative freedom of NJ a little more
(than seemed possible :-) Wherever you are, I hope you'll continue to

			Smoke in peace,

<a name="2">Subject: Re:  Pipes Digest #57 - May 24, 1991</a>

To Elias
sorry to use this way but Elias' path looked somewhat strange to me.

In 1986 I was in Augsburg (west of Munich) for a day and decided to
buy me a second pipe. Since my 1st pipe was a present, I never had 
seriously spent time in a pipe shop before. I found s.th. what occured
to me as a pipe store and up to now its still the biggest pipe shop
I have seen. There I got an introduction on pipes which lasted about
 one hour. The only other thing I remember from this shop:
 this introduction was given by a woman. (Before that I never saw a
 woman 'handling' a pipe and since I remember only one more; WHY IS
 this so ?)
As far as I remember from this day the shop was near the eastern
end of the inner cities foot-passengers zone. There are two main
lanes of shops with some places inbetween. The lanes going east-west
but slightly bowed to the south. I recall the shop at the southern
bow about 100 meters from the eastern end.

Err, hope you dont get lost with this description.
And (since it was my 1st and therefor impressive visit of a pipe shop)
you might only find a small kiosk  :)
In the end I came out of the shop with my 2nd pipe:
  Stanwell No. 11 ,  black and 'sand beamed'
It's still my favoured one.

However, I wish you a nice stay in  Garmisch 
				     ^
and there is still  'my' shop in Bonn; AVOID any shop in the foot passenger
zone here ! But as I see you are not passing here. 

regards
Martin

[ Martin, I'm having trouble getting through to Elias too. Neither his
old address (?????@?????.???.???.???) nor his new one

Steve,

When were you in CA?  And you didn't even call :-&lt;  You are very right about
the anti-smoking atmosphere here.  We have a larger portion of yuppies here
and most of them expect to live forever so anything that reduces that goal
is a threat and is treated most harshly.  Oh well,  live and let live.  It
is kind of funny that most of them jog, and jogging in this smog filled
area for 20 min. is equivalent of 2 pack of cigarretes.  Go figure, for sure.

Take care,

Norm

		   Pipes Digest #59 - June 29, 1991

<a name="2">Subject: From Cigarettes to Pipes</a>


It's nice to see the pipes group going so well.  I have a question regarding
the new member Tim and his plan to change one smoking medium for another.  I
understood that smoking a pipe was healthier than cigarettes because pipe 
smokers rarely inhaled the smoke.  It normally just drifts in the mouth.  But
cigarette smokers who convert to pipes face even greater risk because they
continue to inhale and recieve a condensed version of the smoke and more of
it.  Can anybody set me straight?

<a name="3">Subject: Advice on first-time pipe buy</a>

&gt; From: ????@??????.??? (Tim Szeliga)
&gt; Subject: First Time
&gt; 
&gt; Steve - 
&gt; Around Father's Day I had a mental image of
&gt; myself sitting in the glider on the front
&gt; porch, tamping my pipe, fiddling with the 
&gt; stem and otherwise accheiving oral, 
&gt; manual, mental and lungal gratification,
&gt; all at once.

Did you happen to notice a blue Chevy van about this time ?  That's our
"Recruitmobile," and it drives all over the country projecting those
feelings with a patented new thought-control device.  I'm curious to see if
the invisibility screen is functioning.  8-)

&gt; I would like advice before I waslk into 
&gt; the tabaconist's.  What is a good starter pipe?
&gt; What is a good blend?  What sort of price range
&gt; should I pay, both for pipe and tobacco?

Well, there are different schools of pipe smoking.  The Highbrow School will
first inform you (politely, but pointedly) that the correct spelling is
"tobacconist's."  They will then, in their own scholarly way, proceed to
teach you about cognac, single-malt scotch, the steeplechase, and yachting,
until they eventually get around to suggesting a $75 briar and a proper
English tobacco blend.  The Lowbrow School will send you to the drug store
for a Doctor Grabow and a pouch of Cap'n Black.
 
Myself, I'd suggest you buy whatever pipe strikes your fancy.  You'll
probably want something in around the $30 price range, but that's
adjustable to your budget; you can get pipes with small cosmetic blemishes
for even less, and they're often excellent smokers.  I'd opine that a
simple shape would be a good starter; perhaps a straight-shanked,
rounded-bowl (the classic "dad" pipe, ala' the Appleton's or J.R. "Bob"
Dodds.)  But if a deep curve really fires your spirit, then go for it!

A few simple things to look for:

  - Wall thickness.  You want a uniform thickness, and the thicker the
better.  If it's too thin, the smoke will be hot; local thin places (for
instance, on a square-carved bowl) will become "hot spots," bad for the
pipe and often uncomfortable.  If the wall thickness tapers down toward the
top, that's OK.  Also check the bottom; stick a finger all the way in the
bowl, and gage the thickness with your thumb under the bowl.  You may not
be able to judge this well from day one, but you'll pick it up with
practice; look at some of the more expensive pipes for a "standard."

  - Hole drill.  Make sure the shank hole has been drilled properly.
If it meets the bowl more than about a 16th of an inch above the bottom,
it will be difficult to smoke the pipe all the way down; and therefore,
hard to build up the important heel cake.

  - Stem fit.  Make sure the stem isn't too tight to remove, or so loose
that it slips out easily.  

  - Blemishes.  I advise you don't worry about them.  Their effect on taste
is minor, if any, and your "walking-around" pipe is going to take some
abuse, anyway.  Someday you may want a beautiful "dress" pipe for those
formal occasions (the rare ones that still allow smoking).

  - Grain.  Another one not to worry about.  I've heard people argue
"straight grain conducts heat better", while others say, "curly grain means
dense wood and a cooler smoke."  My favorite pipes have either style, so
I'm a skeptic on the importance of grain.  I can vouch that you can get a
great smoke with either sort.

  - Stem material.  I'm a chewer; rubber stems last me about 3 days of
smoking before they're ruined, so the harder Lucite stems are a must.
Lucito is also more expensive, and can be hard to find on inexpensive
pipes.  You might use this as a tie-breaker.

  - Buy a corncob.  By all means, spend the money on a briar; but toss in
an extra three bucks for a Missouri Meerschaum corncob pipe.  Sure, you'll
look like a hick, but it might just smoke better than your briar.  It'll
also give you something to smoke on off days (you should let a briar rest
for a day after a day's smoking).  Cobs also make great outdoors pipes...
"Dang, my pipe fell out of my mouth and under the lawn mower!  Honey,
throw me another corncob and a match, will you ?" 


Tobacco.  Get one ounce of whatever 3-5 tobaccos smell good to you.  They
won't taste like they smell, but there's a correlation.  English blends,
for example, have an aroma that makes me think of hand-carved hardwood and
fine leather; sure enough, they taste like sawdust and burnt horse.  8-)
Seriously, though... get an ounce of whatever looks interesting.  Then
smoke the whole ounce (or as much of it as you can stand) before switching
to another blend.  The cake in a pipe takes on the flavor of the tobacco,
and it takes at least half an ounce to get the cake settled in so you get
the true flavor.  There's another advantage to having a corncob for your
second pipe - you can be trying a different blend in each pipe.

Also, be sure and ask your wife how she likes each blend; she can enjoy
your pipe almost as much as you do if you account for this, and I've been
surprised at how two blends with similar tastes can have markedly different
smells.  Also be aware that what you smell when you smoke is very different
than how others smell it.  For proof, after smoking for a while, leave the
room (and the pipe) and get some fresh air.  Come back a few minutes later
and take a whiff.

Finally, don't be afraid to tell the tobacconist you're new.  He can
provide lots of other tips on loading, tamping, lighting, etc.

And enjoy!

re: tim's note
I started with a corncob and just got what ever a good cheap blend was (b
bascially just ask for a good mild cheap one) and found after tring 3 or 4 b
blends that I enjoyed them all (except maybe mild burley).  As far price goes
I got 2 oz. of tobaco and all the riggings for the pipe and the pipe it self
for around $10.  I whould suggest that you start with something cheap so you
don't have to worry about losing or damaging it also to see if you like it.

<a name="5">Subject: Welcomes, tips and pipes...</a>

Hello everybody,

I am happy to see that the group continues to grow.  Let's hope that
we will keep adding fellow pipe smokers from all over the world and
continue to exchange information, or simply chat about pipes.  Steve,
I think it might be a good idea if you have some free time between a
Cavendish and a Balkan Sobraine, to put together a list of all the
members of the group with a brief description such as State, city,
country, etc.  And maybe in the near future we may even begin to talk
about a possible Pipe Mailgroup meeting ?? (thoughts??).

Well, again welcome to the new members.

Tim, I think it is a great idea to give up cigaretes (arghhhh!!!!) and
join the civilized world of relaxed pipe smokers.  I did it myself
about 12 years ago and definetely do not regret.  The first steps may
a little ardous.  It takes some time to fully enjoy a pipe, which I
think is very positive.  You learn how to better smoke your pipe(s)
and you grow with accostumed to them.  The first recomendation I have
for you is to buy the book from Steve Hacker "The Ultimate Book of
Pipes" - Steve if the title is wrong, please correct me. I don't have
the book with me and it is 5:30 pm :-).  It is a great book about
pipes and very fun to read.  It gives a lot of general info for the
beginner.  Steve, could you send Tim the address where to order the
book?  If you want to buy a pipe to smoke while you read it, here goes
some general tips:

- Buy a pipe in the unexpensive range, but not from drugstores.  Ask the person
at a good pipe shop to show some pipes.  Never rush to buy a pipe; take your
time.

- Buy a smooth tobacco. Some aromatic cavendish. English tobaccos are heavy for
the beginner, although after a while those will be the only ones you want to
smoke (OK - I know this is MY VERY OWN opinion :-) just kidding. I like
aromatics every once in a while )

- Buy a pipe companion (a small instrument to push the tobacco down the bowl as
you smoke it)

- Buy pipe cleaners

- Fill the bowl sparingly the first 3 to 4 times, increasing the amount on the
next smoke.  Do not pack the tobacco tight the first time. You have to be able
to smoke it smoothly. If you make any effort to puff, it is no good. Do it
again.

- You should not spend more than $20 in this first visit, although you
can spend a lot more if you want.

- Do not over do it.  Smoking pipe is a pleasure not a habit.

- Have fun

 Let us know about your first experiences with a pipe. Do not give up.
With little time you will be enjoying a pipe and have a great time
just like the rest of us :-)


Martin, thanks for your info about pipe shops in Munich, but
unfortunately I only received your mail after my return.  Anyway I
only spent one day in Munich and didn't have much time there.  I saw a
few pipe shops in Vienna but they were way overpriced, so I decided to
hold on for now.

- Elias

[ Good to hear back from you, Elias! I like the idea of an address
list, and of a possible meeting. However, I don't have everyone's
physical address. How about this: if the members send me mail with
this info, I'll put them on the list? More on this later. -S. ]

Hi all,
I just returned from NewMexico to Bonn (180 ft MSL), and after living
one week around 4500ft and the second around 7000 ft  I verbally feel
depressed now.
The second week I explored the northwest of NM and southwest of Colorado
(abbrev. ?). By the stereotypes of nomade indians living in tents, I was 
all but prepared to see the pueblo-cities build 1000 yrs ago in that area.
By all these impressions I totally forgot about my pipes (also due to the thin
air) and about my plans to look for indian pipes.
Now I wait for the slides being developed to see where I was :-)

From: ??????@????.?????.??? (David Chesler, Contractor)
<a name="3">Subject: First pipe (corncob), smell vs. taste, Smoke-Con</a>

 I second the advice on corncob pipes.  Being proud of my working class 
background even though a graduate of an Elite Eastern School(tm) I generally 
try not to look too hoity-toity, which a young man with a briar pipe does.  
Most people are reminded of Gen. MacArthur when they see me smoking a corncob,
but it tastes fine, is much less expensive, and I don't mind knocking one
around.
 It is indeed unfortunate that smoke in the mouth doesn't taste the same 
as smoke in the air (if it did, I'd smoke Marlboro.)  
 I disagree that one need smoke many bowls to learn taste.  For a first
pass, and for an uneducated palate, a single bowl can teach a lot,
especially when trying grossly different flavors.  My tobacconist
was happy to let me take a sample bowl out of the jar.
 
 For my $0.02, my taste has run towards blends called "Mango Cavendish",
or pure Turkish.  The commercial blends (Cap'n Black, Sail) have always
been either too weak-tasting, or have an unpleasant bite.  Cherry flavors
smell sweet, but taste like Life Savers.

 There has been an unfortunate anti-pipe trend in the press lately:
A medical study showed increased mouth cancer for pipes and smokeless
tobacco (I guess we knew this), Dear Abby said it gives bad breath, and
just yesterday Ann Landers had a letter from about a habitual pipe smoker
who denies he is addicted.  She said he's fooling only himself.
 
 I'm always interested in mailing list meetings.  I live in Woburn, Mass,
10 miles north of Boston.  First choice would be to descend on Leavitt
and Pierce in Cambridge, or David P. Erhlich in Boston.  Second choice, 
and probably more central (especially since Our Moderator is in New Jersey) 
would be the Georgopolu factory in lower Manhattan.  Last time I was there 
(about 7 years ago) it was a small, five story building, complete with old 
cigarette rolling machines, headquarters for this three-generation family
importing business, tucked away behind Chase Manhattan Plaza in the financial 
district.

		   Pipes Digest #61 - July 18, 1991


From: ????@??????.??? (Tim Szeliga)
<a name="2">Subject: PIPE ML</a>

Thanks for the suggestions about starting pipesmoking.
I resisted the temptation to rush out to Walgreens or House o'Pipes.
While on vacation in the Adirondacs, I rediscovered a shop in Lake Placid 
I first visited on my honeymoon, "With Pipe and Book".  It is, appropriately
enough, a combination tobacconist and high-quality used book store.  There was 
walk-in humidor for cigars and 22 blends of pipe tobacco on the shelf.

Breck Turner, the proprietor, was kind enough to show me the basics,
set me up with a bent stem and curved lucite briar pipe and a couple ounces
of his store's Cavendish blend.  He took the time to discuss the difference
between aromatic and english; Latakia, Burley and Cavendish; which drugstore
plastic pouch brands are best in an emergency ("Hardly matters; they'll all
be stale anyway."); tamping and relighting.  All this, singlehanded, on the 
Fourth of July weekend in a tourist town.  

They had twenty $30 natural briar pipes to choose from, as well as some gnarly
pipes, Meerschaums, novelty, Rip van Winkle clay pipes.  They do mail-order.
Here comes the plug:

 With Pipe and Book
Breck and Julia Turner, prop.
91 Main Street
Lake Placid, NY  12946

George Bernard Shaw.

<a name="2">Subject: Pipe Con</a>

 Haven't seen a pipe digest in a few weeks (#61, 7/18).  Anyway, if there 
is further discussion of the PipeCon, I'll be out of work and idle from 
August 12 until August 23 (this has only one weekend, Aug 17-18) and I'll 
be in Chicago and San Francisco Aug 24 - Sept 5, so I could come to the 
greater NY area for a PipeCon Aug 17-18 (or mid-week), or Sept 7-8.

  - David Chesler (??????@?????.???)

[ Would others be interested in a get-together in the NY area at
either of those times? Mail me if so. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Agriculture, Mechanics, and the Dirigible Pirates</a>

Well, the story goes like this. Norm Carpenter was in NYC on business
for a couple of days, so I met him for dinner and a pipe at La Bonne
Soupe. (It wasn't the night the NY Pipe Club meets, so we had to do
the smoking outside of the restaurant, along with a little
exploration.) For some reason or another, I mentioned a slightly
strange-of-center bimonthly pipe lore magazine called "The
Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette", in which the Internet Pipes
Mailgroup has been listed for the last two issues. It's edited by Neil
Murray, and well worth the price of $15/year for club and convention
news, as well as the, er, "different" Dirigible Pirates stories.

Norm asked me, quite reasonably, why a pipe journal would have a name
like "The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette." Rather than
paraphrase, I'll repeat the whole story, from Vol. 2 Issue 4, December
1990, p. 2.

"Many of our readers have written in asking questions. Questions such
as, "Where is the 'Great North Woods?', 'Who are these Dirigible
Pirates?', and 'What does it all really mean?'

"Various explanations have been offered from time to time, both by the
informed and also by the uninformed. At long last, this is an attempt
to set the record straight. Consider it a sort of Christmas present,
from us, to you.

"The story of the Dirigible Pirates, which has been accepted by most
people as a work of fiction, is in fact an historical account of
future events. That is to say, when the future becomes the past, and
the present becomes irrelevant, the story of our Pirates will become
an accepted part of our cultural and historical baggage. Suffice it to
say that when the Clean Air Police grab our society by the throat,
wrenching our pipes from between our clenched teeth, a few brave men
and women will take refuge in a place which will become known as, 'The
Great North Woods.' Anticipating their (the Pirates') need for a camp
newsletter, _The Agricultural and Mechanical Literary Gazette_ was
founded -- well in advance of their actual need! (The word 'Literary'
was eventually dropped from the title for reasons which are no longer
of interest - and we can't remember anyway.) As the title implies, the
objective of the _Gazette_ is to inform and entertain the readers
since anything of interest to a Dirigible Pirate - being folks of
simple needs - can be categorized as either agricultural or
mechanical. We initially envisioned that the _Gazette_ would be packed
with informative articles about pipes, tobaccos, the social news of
our cohort, the historical chronicle of the pirates, the husbandry of
small cereal grains and their conversion through fermentation into a
more transportable form, horticulture, the repairs of old pipe
friends, practical machine tools and material sciences. Much of this
has been accomplished and much remains ahead of us.

"And, finally, what does it all mean? We don't know. If we did, maybe
we would be writing for the _Harvard Business Review_ instead."

[ Editor's note: So how does the dang dirigible come into this? ]

In any case, Neil asks me to drop him a note about how the mailgroup
is going, and promises to include it in the next issue. Here's how I'd
describe it.

"Our membership is now over forty (in number, not age :-), and
includes folks from four continents. Unless I'm mistaken, all our
members are of the male persuasion, though women would by no means be
discouraged from joining in, except by the social bias currently
prevailing about who should be permitted to smoke a pipe. We seem to
average about one mailing every three or four weeks; they go out
whenever someone has something to contribute. There are, I am certain,
a few dyed-in-the-wool collectors in our ranks, though most of us are
just ordinary aficionados.

"I started the group two years ago when I heard of the efforts of
Elias Mazur to found a pipe newsgroup. A newsgroup is a different
beast than a mailgroup is. Anyone can read a newsgroup, and a vote
must be taken to create one. Elias called for the vote to found the
newsgroup, but was soundly shouted down by the antismokers on the net,
who are legion. (See my comments on 'flaming' below.) Hearing of this
only by chance, I contacted Elias and founded the mailgroup. Sixty-two
mailings later, we are still here, tapping and puffing happily away.

"One of the more heartening things I see happens when a new member
asks advice on how to become a pipe smoker. The old hands rally to aid
the neophyte, who, if lucky, may even make sense of all the
conflicting approaches suggested ('Buy a corncob!' 'Buy a Dunhill
ODA!' 'Use a lighter!' 'Use kitchen matches!' 'Use flint and steel!')
Some members use the mailgroup to ask about the origin of a peculiar
pipe they own, and some have gotten suggestions for pipe maintenance,
shops in cities to which they'll be traveling, etc. In this way, we
fill a niche that the pipe clubs and conventions miss.

"One thing I should explain is the term 'flaming,' which, in the world
of computer networks, means invective or insult. To avoid this, I
restrict the circulation of the mailgroup to its members only (though
anyone can become a member), and edit out flames. To date, I have not
received even one; we use flames only to light up.  :-)

"In short, we're healthy, reasonably active, and always looking for
new friends and things of tobacconicular interest. If you have access
to the Internet, please drop us a line!

"P.S. Netters use typography for their own purposes. The symbol :-) is
called a 'smiley'; turn it sideways and you'll see why. We've also
developed the symbol ~\U to represent a pipe."

If anyone has anything to add, subtract, or differentiate here, please
let me know and I'll pass the result along to Neil. I'd especially
like to know if anyone heard of the mailgroup either through the
_Gazette_ or _The Pipe Smokers' Ephemeris_.  For those of you
interested in The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette, the address is:

	The Agricultural and Mechanical Gazette
	c/o Neil Murray
	47758 Hickory, Apt. 22305
	Wixom, MI 48393

And finally, I'll light up my old "Beehive" pot shape, the one with
the slight bend that sits on my desk imploring me to smoke it some
more, and wish you,

			Smoke in peace,
			~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: A Greeting To All</a>


Greetings to all my fellow pipe smokers!

I am Robert Whitehead (most call me Bob), and I am a technical
writer for Intergraph, the largest computer-aided design firm in the
United States.

I started smoking a pipe when I was a freshman at Samford University
in Birmingham, Alabama.  This was back around 1978 or so, and being
young and stupid, I picked up a Dr. Grabow and some Borkum Riff Rum
that had been sitting on the shelf at KMart for about eight months. 
Needless to say, I failed to be terribly impressed.

At the time, I was working at an ice cream store in the nearby mall.
One night, after I had just gotten off work (and gotten paid), I
wandered into The Tinder Box and met Skip Elliott, the proprietor's
son and assistant manager.  I struck up a converstion and admitted
that I was not impressed with pipes, having had such a poor
experience with the Grabow &amp; Riff combination.

Skip, a graduate of the Tinder Box training course, offered to set
me straight.  He explained all about the origin of pipes and pipe
smoking (having some impressive texts to help), demonstrated the
proper method to pack and light a pipe, and offered to sell me an
inexpensive meerschaum-lined briar pipe and some good rum-flavored
tobacco.

The rest is, as they say, pipe history.

I've had my little briar for about thirteen years now; it keeps
company with three other lined briars, a straight Danish briar, a
small meerschaum, a meerschaum-capped Calabash, and my latest
acquisition:  a straight-stemmed, detachable German Schwarzvalder
(Black Forest) pipe that I brough home with me from Wiesbaden just
two weeks ago.

I prefer rum tobaccos (as that is my favorit spirit), but I am also
fond of the Trade Winds / Black Satin / Captain Black genre with
vanilla.  I also fondly remember The Tinder Box blend called V.S.O.P
(with cognac).

My first question:  has anyone dealt with Carey's Smokeshop?  I
recently received their catalog in the mail, and I'm interested in
trying the Grandma's Apple Pie blend.  If it smells and tastes as
good as its namesake, I'll be a fan for life; if it isn't, I'll be
sorely disappointed.

In my next missive:  How I converted my roommate in college from a
cigarette chain-smoker to a pipe smoker.

All the Best!

<a name="2">Subject: Has anybody seen John Cotton's #1 or #1&amp;2 ?</a>

Greetings, fellow puffers.

I have a question about a brand of tobacco that I greatly enjoyed 
years ago: John Cotton's.  I used to be about to find Cotton's #1
(a mild English) and #1&amp;2 Medium (a medium English) in smokeshops
everywhere, but I haven't seen it in years.  Does anyone know of
a store that still carries this stuff?  Or has it gone out of
production?  

It's one of my all-time favorites.  The #1 was an especially delightful 
after-breakfast tobacco.

<a name="3">Subject: The Conversion Factor</a>

The Conversion Factor
(or How I Got My Roommate To Give Up Cigarettes)

During my freshman year of college, I moved into the dorm with a
cigarette chainsmoker named Carl Michael Allen.  (Only guy with
three first names I ever met!)

Carl could never understand why I smoked a pipe.  "Why bother?" he'd
ask.  "Look at all the trouble you have to go through for a smoke. 
You gotta have the pipe; you gotta have matches; you gotta have a
pipe nail, a dottle pick, a pipe rag, a tobacco pouch, and so forth.
I can have a smoke any time I want, and all I need is a lighter. 
Besides, if you run out of tobacco, you have to wait for the tobacco
shop to open; I can go to the streetcorner and drop $1.25 into the
cigarette machine for my favorite brand!"

Of course, I rallied my defenses quickly.  "Sure, Carl, smoking a
pipe is a little more trouble, but I think it's worth it.  In the
first place, not everyone can stand the smell of cigarette smoke. 
That's because cigarettes contain stale, dry tobacco that's been
impregnated with phosphorous to keep it burning.  You set a lit
cigarette down in an ashtray, it burns itself to the end of the
filter; that's tantamount to a tear gas grenade.  But how many times
have you heard someone say, 'I love the smell of a pipe; it's so
much nicer than cigarettes'?

"Another good thing about pipes:  as you smoke a pipe, it gets
better and better as it breaks in.  There's no challenge to smoking
cigarettes, and it takes no skill at all to light up.  Pipes make
you work for the burn, but the rewards are worth ten times the
effort.

"Pipe tobacco (that you get fresh from the tobacconists, not the
smunge you get at KMart) is pure, except for the flavorings that are
put in some blends.  Even the flavors are pure:  vanilla, rum,
cognac, cherry, apple, and so forth.  Since the tobacco is pure, it
won't sustain a burn:  you have to keep smoking a pipe, or it'll go
out.  Saves on tobacco if it doesn't keep burning."

Soon, Carl began to see the light.  I even loaded my favorite pipe
with my favorite blend and let him smoke it.  With his first puff,
he was sold; he'd never had such a smooth smoke from a Marlboro!

To complete the conversion, I splurged and bought him a coachman's
pipe with the extra stem lengthener, a pipe nail, and two ounces of
The Tinder Box's V.S.O.P. blend.  I showed him how to break in the
briar, how to pack, how to light, all the time knowing how my Dad
must have felt when he taught me how to shoot.  I felt part of
Tradition.

Soon, Carl and his pipe were inseperable.  I'd come back to the room
between classes and find him stretched out on his bed, his pipe bowl
nestled on his chest, his eyes closed and a look of sheer angelic
bliss plastered on his puss.  Occasionally, he'd open one eye and
cuss me, tongue firmly in cheek, for getting him started on pipes.

"I can't get through the day without coming back to the room, lying
down, and smoking this damned thing!" he wailed.  "Beats driving
everyone else out of the room with those coffin nails you *used* to
smoke," I retorted.  "You got that right," Carl finally admitted.

Christmas rolled around.  Carl had cast longing looks at my
meerschaum-capped Calabash pipe I had bought and with which I had
fallen in love, so before he left for his hometown of Drasco,
Arkansas, I purchased an identical pipe for him.  Needless to say,
Carl was stunned when he unwrapped the pipe and pouch of Aalborg
tobacco he'd found on his desk.

I guess you could say my roommate and I were good friends from then
on.

Time passed; Carl completed his studies and was graduated from
Samford as a summa cum laude Accounting student.  I left Samford and
went on to Auburn to carry on the tradition, then went to Air Force
Basic Training in April of 1980.

I haven't heard from Carl Michael Allen since 1979; I understand he
is a bank accountant in Little Rock, Arkansas.  If anyone on the
list is from the Little Rock area, and perhaps know of Carl's
whereabouts, please pass along my regards.

And, in the words of our esteemed moderator,

Smoke in peace!

<a name="4">Subject: Renting &amp; puffing</a>

From time to time, I scan the ``Rentals to Share'' ads in the
newspapers, and see a lot of ads for nonsmokers only. Now, I have
nothing against those folks, but I'd certainly appreciate knowing when
I was welcome in a place, as well as when I was unwelcome (as one
poster ad made clear with the suffix, "This means YOU, butthead!" How
bigoted! How unkind!)

Therefore, I'd like you to think about the following. If you have an
apartment for rent, or to share, why not advertise it as ``Pipe smoker
welcome'' ? What could be frendlier, and more in keeping with the
spirit of camraderie among pipe people?

And, after your tenant moves in, you will be secure in the knowledge
that he or she will be quiet, clean, and timely with the rent payments
(as all pipe smokers are :-) Knowing this, you can relax and

						Smoke in peace,

<a name="2">Subject: Stem repair from the Golden State</a>

I had the fortunate experience to be within a hundred miles of our
dedicated moderator Steve recently when I was called to NY City rather
briskly on business.  With a suit bag in hand,  ready for the drive to
the airport, I decided to sit down at the system and drop a quick email
note for Steve letting him know that I was going to be on the East
Coast.  I suggested a possible meeting, signed off, and headed East.

Later,  when I had been working at the trouble spot for a day,  I
arrived at my hotel room to find a message from Steve.  I quickly
called him and we agreed to meet for dinner the next day.  Elias was
supposed to join us but he had a prior obligation somewhere else.

During our discussion at dinner the topic of loose stems came up.  I
had told Steve that the tobacco shop owner where I first bought my pipe
had taught me a quick fix for a loose stem.  Steve suggested that I
send this out over the mailgroup.  Not a bad suggestion, so here it
is...

I have a problem of having the stems on my pipe becomming loose over
time.  I think this happens because I get a lot of moisture in my
pipe.  (No, I don't remove the stem while the pipe is hot!)  Anyhow,
when I was a beginner I took my first pipe back to the shop and showed
the guy my problem.  I expected a repair job, but he smiled at me and
said, "I'll show you this once, after that you're on your own."

here is a picture:  (please disregard the lousy Ansii art)

He took my pipe and removed the stem.  He grabbed the thickest pipe cleaner
he had and inserted it into the mouth end of the pipe until it just appeared
at the other end.  Then he lit a match and held it under the stem for a few
seconds (maybe five or so).  The flame never touched the tenon on the stem,
but it did melt the rubber.  After this he quickly pushed the stem against the
counter being careful to hold the stem so that the tenon was as perpendicular
to the counter as possible.  This caused the tenon to bulge a little.

After waiting a few minutes to allow the stem to cool, he grabbed a piece of
sandpaper and started to bring the tenon back down to a size that would fit
the mortise.  When he got close he kept testing the tenon by inserting it
into the mortise.  He cautioned "Never try to force the tenon in,  let it
fit snug, but easy to insert.  Otherwise you'll only end up with a cracked
shank."  (I didn't listen very well because after a year I did crack the
shank on one of my favorite pipes,  but it was repairable with a metel band.)

Once he got the tenon to fit snug, he removed it from the shank and rubbed 
the entire tenon surface with a pencil.  This provided a lubricant (graphite)
and allowed the snug tenon/mortise to fit together nicely.  His last comment
was,  "This 'quick fix' is good for about three times,  after that you are
going to need a new stem."

I would'nt try this method for the first time on your most favorite pipe, but
it does beat sending them in to get repaired.

Re: Article reprint from Utne Reader

For those who don't know of it, "The Utne Reader" is sort of a liberal
(or progressive, if you're afraid to use The L Word) version of
"Reader's Digest". I'll post the following short article, which
appeared under the "Civil Liberties" section of the May issue, without
further comment.

		Is The Anti-Smoking Movement Elitist?

In the last few years, as the evidence has mounted on the dangers of
smoking and passive smoke, it has begun to seem that even smokers
themselves were against the nasty habit. (For a particularly agonized
smoker's apologia, see "The Sun" [Feb. 1991].)

But now a new smokers' champion has appeared in (where else?) the
libertarian journal "Reason" (Feb. 1991). While not denying the health
dangers of smoking, author Jacob Sullum suggests that the anti-smoking
movement is "profoundly paternalistic. It does not trust people to
make their own choices about smoking - neither whether to do it nor
whether to tolerate it."

By banning cigarette advertising under the guise of calling it
commercial speech, we are compromising all freedom of speech, he
argues, since with enough effort we could classify almost anything as
commercial speech. Also, Sullum points out, it smacks of elitism for
certain groups (i.e., smug, educated, white upper-middle-class types)
to object to the cigarette niche marketing aimed at other, supposedly
more vulnerable groups such as young working-class women and blacks.
By doing so, Sullum argues, one group is essentially proclaiming
itself as superior to other groups that it has deemed incapable -
unlike itself - of standing up to advertising pitches.

Finally, and perhaps most controversially, he questions the supposed
irrefutable dangers of passive smoking, pointing out that most studies
on secondary smoke (and there have been relatively few) relate to
long-term exposure in the home, yet these studies are used to justify
jaws banning smoking in public places and businesses.

Don't know about you, but it kind of makes me want to vote Libertarian
next time :-) Perhaps, unlike the Republicrats, they have some
interest in letting us,

<a name="2">Subject: Aromatic vs. What?</a>

Greetings, fellow pipe-o-philes (or whatever we're called);

Ever since I started smoking a pipe (circa 1978), I've never
understood aromatics.

The way I've always thought of it, an aromatic is a tobacco that
smells great (lit or unlit), but doesn't have much taste.  To my way
of thinking, that's sort of a social tobacco; something you can
smoke at a party and not worry about choking everyone out of the
room.

Well, if that's the case, what do you call a blend that tastes
great, but maybe doesn't have much in the aroma department?

I ask this because I just got my new Carey's Smokeshop catalog, and
I'm dying to try some of the flavored blends, but some of the
aromatics sound great, too.  Does anyone out there buy from Carey's?

While I'm on the subject, does anyone smoke an Aerosphere pipe?  How
do you like it?

&gt; [ Aerosphere? Never heard of it... tell us more! I'm sure we'd like

Well, an Aerosphere pipe has a small brass dingus with a hole in it
on the side of the stem.  It is supposed to draw a metered amount of
air into the stem each time you draw on the pipe.  This is supposed
to cool down the smoke and help the tar and nicotine precipitate
out.

Once you finish the pipe, the hole allows the precipitated tar,
nicotine, and other fluids to evaporate out.

The prices for Aerosphere pipes seem reasonable enough; I just
wondered if anyone out there had tried one.

About Carey's Smokeshop:  they stock a good variety of blends,
pipes, cigars, pipe tool and accessories.  They also have a tobacco
club, which gives you all sorts of discounts and first chances at
sales events.  If you smoke at least three pounds per year, it is a
good deal.

<a name="2">Subject: Mixing pipes and cigars</a>

Greetings, fellow pipesmokers;

Back 'way long years ago, when I was in my Senior year of college, I
had a professor who did something I've never seen done before or
since with a pipe:

He smoked a cigar in it!

He'd take his cigar and light it, then put it butt-first into his
pipe and smoke it.

I can only surmise that he smoked nothing _but_ cigars in this pipe.
I can imagine what smoking a cigar in an already-broken-in pipe
might do to the flavor of the pipe; I'm sure it would destroy the
carbon cake.

Now, in addition to my pipes, I occasionally enjoy a good cigar.  I
often buy several cigars fresh, then store them in the freezer until
I'm ready to indulge.  Not long ago, I bought a high-bowled
Meerschaum-lined pipe with which I am not terribly pleased, and I
don't smoke it much.  Well, an idea has struck me:  I'm considering
trying what my old Prof did and smoking a cigar in this
less-than-satisfactory pipe, hoping that the Meerschaum lining will
temper the cigar smoke as it does my regular blend.

Has anyone else had any experience with this technique?  How did you
enjoy it?  If I start doing this regularly, should I use this pipe
for nothing else.

<a name="2">Subject: Re: Mixing pipes and cigars</a>

Hello everyone,

Robert Whitehead writes:

&gt;Back 'way long years ago, when I was in my Senior year of college, I
&gt;had a professor who did something I've never seen done before or
&gt;since with a pipe:
&gt;
&gt;He smoked a cigar in it!

Before taking up a pipe, I would infrequently enjoy a cigar. I switched
to a pipe under the influence of a roomate who insisted that I would
enjoy it more. It was much like the scenario that Robert described in
digest #64. My only regret was that I waited so long. Even though I prefer
the pipe, every once and I while I still smoke a cigar.

I often toyed with the idea of trying a cigar in a pipe but my idea was
to first shread the tobacco from the cigar into something like pipe 
tobacco. I had never thought of just sticking the cigar directly into
the pipe. This seems like an interesting idea. Sort of like combining
both worlds. 

Expecting that the taste would be a little strange if using a pipe
which had already been broken in, at least until the cake had acclimated
itself. I found a pipe which I was not particularly fond of and being 
somewhat curious, tried it.

It worked quite well although looked somewhat strange. It would
probably be something you would not do in public but could enjoy in the
comfort of your own home. Next time, it would be possible to smoke the
cigar normally, and when it got a bit shorter insert it into the pipe.
This would be possible since it seemed to take longer to smoke the
cigar using the pipe. You could treat the cigar as a pre-packed pipe.
Overall, once getting past the cake acclimation period it was an
enjoyable experience. You would probably not want to use the pipe for
anything else since the cigar would be overpowering to any other pipe
blend.

I am wondering if anyone else has tried this and if so, what their 
reaction was.

<a name="2">Subject: Pre-packed pipes</a>

John Kaczala writes, concerining my article about mixing pipes and cigars:

&gt; You could treat the cigar as a pre-packed pipe.

I have often wondered if tobacco processors had ever considered
compressing a measured amount into a cylinder, then vacuum-sealing
the pouches.  This would allow you to simply take a "plug" (for lack
of a better word), drop it in your bowl, then cut it up and re-tamp
it with your favorite pipe tool.

Here are some questions I would ask:

1. Does vacuum-sealing tobacco cause the moisture to boil out,
leaving the tobacco dry?

2. Would there be problems with determining a standard size for the
plugs?  (Sounds like we're smoking Zoysia sod, folks....;-)

3. Would you want each individual plug sealed like so:

<a name="2">Subject: Review of two great blends</a>

Greetings, fellow pipe lovers;

Many of you may remember my postings about Carey's SmokeShop, and
the questions I have asked about the blends they carry.  Well,
recently I found a smokeshop in my hometown that carries the same
Danish blends that Carey's packages.  So, today I present a reivew
of two of them:  Cinnamon and Raisin, and Cocoa Creme.

Cinnamon and Raisin
===================

The first thing you notice about this blend is that the aroma of
cinnamon does not leap out of the pouch and assault your nasal
passages, nor is the raisin scent overpoweringly sweet.  In fact,
you'd probably have a hard time telling just _what_ in the Sam Hill
was in the blend in the first place.

Cinnamon and Raisin is a mildly aromatic blend; not thick and
cloying like some fruit-flavored tobaccos (most notably cherry
blends), C&amp;R tends to be somewhat sharp in its unlit state, but
quickly mellows when burning.  This blend is definitely for
those people who like to take their time with a pipe, for smoking it
too fast will result in a very unpleasant tongue bite.  It also
tends to burn a bit hotter than other similar blends.

Because of its propensity for hot burns, I recommend C&amp;R for a long
pipe, such as a meerschaum-capped Calabash or a Churchwarden's
long-stem.  Strangely enough, a short-stemmed corncob pipe also does
well; I think it must be the excellent heat-radiating properties of
the cob.  Clay pipe smokers should stay away from this one.

C&amp;R is very pleasant indoors.  Many people have asked me what blend
I was smoking and where they could get it.  Very good for after
dinner, especially with a brandy or some other restorative drink. 
Not good for straight rum drinkers, as the cinnamon bite can be
amplified by the rum.

Cocoa Creme
===========

Ever had chocolate satin pie in a fancy restaurant?  It's one of my
favorites, and CC reminds me very much of how such a confection just
sort of sashays across your tongue.

CC is pure joy to smoke; an excellent blend for novices or for
breaking in a new pipe.  With its light, smooth aroma, CC is a blend
to enjoy all day.  It simply refuses to bite or burn (unless you smoke
like a Hoover).

&gt;From its name, you'd expect that CC would have a pronounced
chocolate nose or taste.  Not true!  CC has a very mild cocoa aroma
when unlit that quickly goes away while burning.  The flavor has
just a *hint* of chocolate tempered with vanilla, and an
oh-so-smooth and creamy texture in the mouth.

I realize I'm waxing poetic about CC, but I can't get over how very
*good* this blend is!  I had almost given up my pipes altogether
because I couldn't find a blend that I could be happy with.  Then I
found CC and fell in love with my pipes all over again.

Happy Puffing!

<a name="3">Subject: A Christmas calabash</a>

Greetings, pipe fans,

Hope y'all had a good Holiday! (Some of us may still be having one
around April or so, or trying to recover...)

This Christmas, I splurged on a Nording for myself. It's approximately
a "briar Calabash" shape, fairly large, with a full-bent stem and a
chopped top. Beautiful pipe, smokes nice and cool, and I haven't yet
found the first fill in it. I inaugurated it the right way, on
Christmas night, in front of a fireplace, with a bowlful of Balkan
Sobranie 759.

One of the things I found out, in connection with the Nording, is that
it is possible to negotiate price, even in a mall pipe shop, even just
before the holidays! I had seen the pipe in a display case in the John
David shop, and the store owner, noticing my interest, opened the
cabinet and let me have a closer look. I looked, agreed it was a nice
pipe, but thought the $70 pricetag was too much. "I'll wait until it's
on sale," I declared.

"You want a sale? We'll have a sale! I'll let it go for $60. How about
that?"

"Mmmm, nah, it's still a little too rich for my blood." He resumed
filling my tobacco order. I then had an inspiration.

"Now, for $50, I think I could buy it," said I.

"Wait a minute." He began rummaging around for a calculator. "I think
I can give you about 20 percent off. That'd bring it down to about
$55. How about that?"

"Sold," I replied, and handed over the plastic fantastic. The Nording
was mine. And, perhaps, part of what makes it so enjoyable is the
memory of this small, but satisfying, negotiation.

Whether or not you got a Christmas pipe this year, I wish you and
yours a happy "holiday from the Holidays." And, until next time,

	Smoke in peace,
	~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Harsh Re-Start</a>


Dear fellow Pipers,

  I have only recently started smoking my pipe again after a long respite.
I went to the TinderBox and got some Golden Cavendish -- the problem
is that the smoke is a lot harsher than I remember from a few years ago.

I have been smoking out of my old pipe -- a fairly small pocket pipe
  that was once broken in and well used (during college).

My questions are --
  -- does my pipe need to get re-broken in?
  -- is there a milder blend I could get here in health concious So. CA?
  -- should I dump this little pipe and get a large one ?
       (would it give a milder smoke?)
  -- does a person's taste in smoking materials change with years?

James aka ????????@??.???????.???

[ I don't think the pipe needs to get broken in again, nor do you need
a new one (though it never hurts to have several and rotate them).
Check the tobak - if it's too dry, it can smoke harshly (as I'm
finding out right at this moment :-) Also, you may be smoking a bit
too hard, or the pipe might not be clean. 

As for taste in tobaccos, I know mine has changed. When I was 17 or
so, I used to smoke Amphora Blue exclusively; I'm now much more into
Englishoid blends.

Thanks for the note, James, and let us know how it goes! I hope one of
our other members will be able to suggest some things I've missed. -S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: Pipe stories and personalized bitmap pipe cursor.</a>

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

Very happy to see the group alive and smoking.  I've had this piece of one of
the Sherlock Holmes' adventures sitting in my desk, and I've been meaning to
post it for a while now.  Well, better late than never.

(note: comments in brackets are obviously mine..)

-----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;From the "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"

(story begins ... mystery prevails ... the game is afoot)
(then, after collecting the clues...)

"He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue
dressing-gown, and then wandered around the room collecting pillows
from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs.  With these he
constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself
cross legged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid
out in front of him.  In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting
there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly
upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
silent, motionless with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline
features.  So he sat as I dropped off the sleep, and so he sat when a
sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found the summer sun
shining into the apartment.  The pipe was still between his lips, the
smoke still curled upward and the room was full of dense tobacco haze,
but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the
previous night."

(morning... mystery is solved ...)
(the police detective to Mr. Holmes...)

"I am sure Mr. Holmes that we are very much indebted for your having
cleared the matter up."

"I reached this one", said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows
and consuming an ounce of shag.  I think, Watson, that if we drive to
Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

--------------------------------------------------------


Really enjoyable story.  I don't remember at this moment what is the
title of the story.  It is a short story in the collection of "The
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes".  I will look it up if someone wishes
to read it.  I personally recommend reading them all.

Question to the group:

Has anybody ever solved a mystery, ever found a great solution for a
complex or mundane problem "...by sitting upon five pillows and
consuming an ounce of shag" ? .. Let us know.

For the new (and old members) of the group that have a GUI type of
workstation (X, Motif, twm,...): some time ago I posted a bitmap that
I designed of a nice Oom Paul pipe (deep bent).  I looks very nice and
I use it as my X windows cursor.  I am re-posting it again:

Instructions:
------------

1) extract the first bitmap (between `cut mark 1' and `cut mark 2') and save it
in a file. Call it "bigpipe".

2) do the same for the bitmap mask (between `cut mark 2' and `cut mark end');
save it in the file "bigpipeMask".

3) to make the pipe your customized, personalized cursor, type in the system
prompt of an xterm:

xsetroot -cursor &lt;path&gt;/bigpipe &lt;path&gt;/bigpipeMask -bg brown -fg black

where &lt;path&gt; is the full path to the directory where "bigpipe" and "bigpipeMask"
are located.

4) move the cusor to the root window and be delighted.

5) you may want to put it in your .xinitrc so it is executed every time you
start X.

The hot-spot (the place where the click of the mouse takes effect) in
on the bit of the pipe.

I have a color monitor, so I don't know how it looks on a monochrome monitor.

It looks nicer on a solid root window background color.  I use:

xsetroot -solid grey46

Feel free to send me mail if you have problems with it. Actually, if
you do have problems, just sit down and smoke a nice and relaxing
pipe.  The answer will come to you as the blue smoke curls over your
head :-)~\U

Here it goes...

[ Thanks for the "bit" map, Elias, and good to hear from you! (Other
readers: the mail to sandoz is kind of flaky; if your mail to Elias
bounces, try again.) Personally, I've had a few good thoughts
materialize out of the smoke of my pipe, but I've never consumed a
whole ounce of shag, or even anything else less scorching, at one
sitting. Even with the aid of five pillows.  My tongue aches at the
very thought! :-O~ -S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: 9th Annual PCCA Convention and Pipe Show</a>

I got a flyer from The Compleat Smoker a few weeks ago, announcing the
ninth annual Convention and Pipe Show, June 5-7, at the Gateway
Marriott in Arlington, VA. They'll have "over 130 tables of pipes,
tobacco, cigars, related books, and catalogs hosted by private
collectors, retail dealers, importers, and industry trade
representatives," and a number of special events. It looks like a good
show, and the price is right too: FREE. I'm planning on spending a day
there, probably Sunday the 7th.  Is anyone else interested in getting
together there or driving down?

The convention schedule is, roughly:

Friday, June 7:
- Reception, hosted by Levin Pipes and PCCA

Saturday, June 8:
- Coffee courtesy McClleland Tobacco
- Show floor open 10 AM - 5 PM
- Judging for show awards Saturday afternoon
- Buffet dinner banquet ($35 for that)
- Open smoker reception 9 PM - 1 AM

Sunday, June 9:
- Coffee courtesy _The Compleat Smoker_ magazine
- Show floor open 9 AM.
- Award announcement 11 AM.
- Pipe smoking contest at 1 PM. Over $5000 in prizes, including a
  Collector Radice pipe valued at $840 and a Savinelli briar finished
  18 pipe display cabinet valued at $700. Each contestant gets a new
  pipe, and the entrance is free!

The Crystal Gateway Marriott is at 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway,
Arlington, VA 22202, or call (800) 228-9290 (from inside Virginia,
(703) 920-3230). 

Please let me know if you're interested in carpooling, and hope to see
you there! Until next time, then, may every puff be cool, and may your
favorite place to light up be always smoke-friendly.

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

Dear fellow pipe smokers:

I will be going to Chicago to work for 2 weeks on July, 13th.  Since I
will be staying over the weekend, it would be nice to tour around some
of the pipe shops in the area.  If anyone has recommendations on pipe
shops in the great Chicago area I would appreciate to hear about it.

And if anyone who lives in the area would like to get together to have
a nice pipe conversation over dinner, just let me know...

Smoke in peace,

Elias Mazur ~\U

[ You might want to look up the Up Down Tobacco Shop; I think that's
in Chicago. Any other recos for Elias? -S. ]

Dear pipers,

In early August I'll be in Princeton, NJ at a summer seminar for two
weeks. I thought it might be a good opportunity to try some American
tobaccos, and perhaps buy an American pipe or two.

My question to you all: are there any good tobacconists around
Princeton, NJ?

Thank you for any tips!

Elias reminded me that I needed to send a note to you guys.  I'll be in 
Cape Cod on Thursday and wonder if anyone knows about some tobacco/pipe
shops I should visit in New Fallmouth or Boston?  I am running low on
tobacco and might just have to stop smoking for a day or two to wait
until I get to a new unexplored shop there.  I'm brining my wife along,
so I probably won't be able to buy a new pipe ;-) but I can have fun
looking.

 I'm always interested in mailing list meetings.  I live in Woburn, Mass,
10 miles north of Boston.  First choice would be to descend on Leavitt
and Pierce in Cambridge, or David P. Erhlich in Boston.  Second choice, 
and probably more central (especially since Our Moderator is in New Jersey)

Hi there,
happens that I go to Sydney via Honkong in about 2 weeks from now.
As I have only some 8 hrs for shopping in Honkong, I would highly
appreciate any suggestions about pipes and shops there (no, I dont
mean the opium pipes) before I go there.
In Sydney I'll have some more time, roughly 6 months working there.
But for I was told that smoking is frowned upon down there and
"out-of-date" as one said, there might be kinda subculture there, who knows.
So maybe one of you knows some 'under-cover addresses' there ?

regards
Martin

 Seacost tobacconists:
  Princeton:
   There was a suitably academic tobaco shop in Princeton Boro a few years
ago; things being the way they are it's probably still there.  Not being
a wearer of the Orange and Black myself (and my Princetonian sibling
being more interested in driving between Elm Street and the E-Quad) my 
directions are a little off, but Princeton Boro is a nice place to walk anyway:

   There is a short street "west" of Nassau Street (that is, the opposite
side from the campus).  In the quarter-mile stretch between the Post
Office (which might have been called Prospect Square, opposite about
the level of Nassau Hall) and the Boro Police Station (opposite the
U-Store) that's about where the shop was.  And maybe the street is
two blocks west of Nassau Street.

 Boston:
  As I've often repeated, the must-see is Leavitt and Pierce, south of
Harvard Yard, Mass Ave, Cambridge (MBTA Red Line to Harvard).  In downtown
Boston, near the Freedom Trail and Quincy Market/Faneul Hall is David
P. Ehrlich (top of Tremont St, near MBTA Green Line Govt Center [once
Scollay Sq] but near enough to Red/Green Park Street.)


 I've just come back from a weekend on the South Shore/Near Cape/Buzzard's
Bay area :-), but I don't know of any tobacconists in that area.  I did
start to break in a new briar pipe my fiancee bought me for my birthday
(OK, a Dr. Grabow, but it's my first briar since I realized corn cobs
suited my level-of-care better) on the shores of White Island Pond,
Wareham,  and we dined in two restaurants that tolerated pipe-smoking
(awfully close to our non-smoking table) so this may be a pipe-friendly
region.

  This new pipe, and a new bag of "Tropic Cavendish" were purchased
from a gentleman with a tracheotomy (not the best advertisement for our
vice) at the Tobacconist, Ltd, a mall chain store in Nashua, NH.  They 
used to carry a blend called "Mango Cavendish", which was similarly to 
a blend of the same name Ehrlich used to make.  The salesman said this 
was similar, but it was much less sweet and more bitter.
 
 My late grandfather-in-law (the reason my fiancee likes men with pipes)
used to smoke something called "Perkins #51 mixture".  I'll be looking for
it around here, but any pointers would be appreciated.  Its secondary
smoke (what's the word for the aroma that everybody gets to enjoy?)
is apparently similar to Mango Cavendish, so it might please both me
and my fiancee.

                                 a direct, if not permanent, position)

[ I believe that the Princeton tobacco shop has since closed, but it
bears checking out. Thanks! -S. ]

Emerson's house, and was a stones throw from Walden Pond.  But I did not 
get to one !#@%!$#^!$ pipe shop.  The worst part is that we parked near

There used to be a little nice pipe store in Princeton but I can't
remember the name or street name (*sigh*, the mind is going :).  It's
on a street parallel to the Nassau St.  And I believe you go down the
street opposite the main Princeton Univ. entrance and then make the
first right.  Hopefully you can find it with those directions :)

From: Steve Masticola (????????@??.???????.???)
<a name="3">Subject: Pipe initialization and maintenance</a>

There's really no big deal to lighting a pipe; it just takes some
practice. First, get yourself a quality pipe and some good tobacco.  I
like Petersons and GBDs; they're usually a good buy. Avoid pipes with
lacquer finishes, or with a lot of "fills" (putty applied to smooth
over surface defects). Rough-surfaced pipes are fine, though, and
usually cost a little less (and smoke cooler).  You should plan on
spending $30-50 for a decent pipe; smoke shops are usually willing to
bargain on price, and often have sales.  Look them over and buy the
one you like best; it's largely a matter of personal preference.

Amphora Regular, or a similar mild non-aromatic or light aromatic
Burley/Virginia blend, would be a reasonable tobak for a beginner.
Keep the package tightly sealed to keep it fresh. Experiment with
tobaccos until you find what you like. It helps to get a tobacco that
your wife or girlfriend likes, so get her input. If she doesn't like
pipes at all, get a new one of those, too. :-)

Also get a package of cleaners, a bottle of pipe sweetner, a LOT of
wooden matches :-), and a pipe tool with tamper, reamer, and scraper.
I have a neat little one made by GBD; it looks like a silhouette of a
pipe, and has wooden sides. It cost me about $12.

Now, to the matter of lighting. Pack the tobacco a bit at a time,
perhaps 1/3 of the bowl. You want to have it slightly springy, neither
loose nor tight. It should be easy to draw through. Use the reamer to
loosen it if it's too tight.

Light a match and hold it horizontally until the match completely
catches fire. Then hold it horizontally over the bowl, puffing and
moving the match in a circular motion over the tobacco until it is
alight. Avoid burning the edge of the bowl when you light up. After a
little while, the tobacco may go out. If so, tamp it down a little and
re-light. If there's a lot of ash in the bowl, empty it out without
knocking the pipe, then tamp and re-light.

You may find the pipe getting a little juicy as you smoke. To avoid
this, try to keep your mouth dry as you smoke, and avoid swallowing.
If it does get juicy, run a cleaner down it to clear it out. However,
don't take the stem off the pipe while it's still hot, as this will
eventually cause the stem to get loose.  (You can, however, take a
military-type push stem off a hot pipe; many Petersons and Savinellis
have this feature.)

Try to puff rhythmically. If the pipe gets too hot, or if your tongue
gets "bitten", slow down, or lay the pipe down and let it cool awhile
if necessary.  If the pipe goes out a lot, speed up. Before too long
you'll find a good rhythm.

Try to smoke your pipe all the way down, as long as it's pleasant.
This helps build up an even layer of "cake" (carbon) inside the bowl.
When you're done, clean all the dottle (ashes and unburned tobacco)
out of the bowl with the reamer. Avoid banging your pipe on the
ashtray, as this can make dents in the pipe. Put a cleaner in the
(cool) pipe until the next time you smoke it, to absorb any leftover
juice and help keep it clean.

"Break-in" refers to the initial carbonization of the bowl.  Many
pipes now come with pre-carbonized bowls and require no break-in. I'd
recommend such a pipe for a beginner.  However, it's desirable to
maintain a 1-2 millimeter layer of cake for a cool, even smoke.

If your pipe smokes sour or gurgles, if there's a lot of goo inside
the stem, or if the cake is very thick, it's time for a cleaning. This
usually will have to be done every 5-10 smokes. First, use the knife
blade of the pipe tool to scrape the cake to the proper thickness.
Then use the reamer to get any heavy goo out of the wood part of the
air hole of the stummel (the wood part of the pipe). Dip a cleaner in
the pipe sweetner, and run it through the stem; repeat with fresh
cleaners until they come out clean. Repeat with the stummel air hole;
be careful not to get any cleaner on the outside of the pipe, as this
harms the finish. After cleaning, let the pipe rest a few hours before
smoking it again, to give the sweetner a chance to dry out.

If you like smoking a pipe, why not get another? Or several? Most pipe
smokers have some kind of a collection, since we like variety, and
because pipes smoke better if they're given time to rest between
smokes. I have about 25, but I've been building my collection for
about 15 years. Make sure you've gotten to know the last pipe before
you buy the next one, so you don't wind up with a lot of new, unsmoked
pipes. It's OK to make mistakes; hardly anyone likes every pipe they
buy.

Lastly, enjoy! Don't smoke if you don't feel like it. It should be a
pleasurable pastime.

Perhaps (undoubtedly!) our other members will have things to add to
this. There are a million ways to smoke a pipe, all of them right. :-)
Let us know how it's going.

Until next time, then,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

the corner of Spring and Witherspoon, one block away from Nassau).

Hello All,
 
I was wondering if people could recommend pipe tobacco.  I'd like something 
mild and preferably aromatic and distributed nationally as opposed to local 
tobacconist custom blends.

[ Note to readers: This message was sent out unmoderated due to a bug
in the mail system. The bug has since been fixed; please let me know

More to the point, I just tried a pouch of "Sail Natural," and liked
it a lot. No bite at all, so it's a good beginner's blend! -S. ]

Although my taste for tobacco today is located on the other side of
the spectrum from you (very strong, non-aromatic English tobacco), I
used to smoke a lot of aromatic and mild tobacco in the beginning of
my pipe smoking career.  At that time I lived in Brazil where it was
very hard to get custom made tobacco and sometimes hard to find even
the more commercial types.  For this reason I used to smoke more
commercial blends. Well, here goes a summary of what I remember (it's
been a while :-)...

- I personally enjoyed (and still smoke it sometimes) the Amphora. It
is a Dutch Cavendish tobacco.  It has 4 different types identified by
the color of the pouch (red, brown, green and blue).  The strength
determines the types. Based on your message you might want to check
the extra mild.

- Another one I used to smoke often was the Borkum Riff.  They have
several types (I remember a whiskey Cavendish that I liked).  They
have a very good Black Cavendish which is very good and aromatic, but
maybe a little stronger. Give it a try.

- A very good one that you may like is the Captain Black.  It is very
aromatic and mild.

- Another one that I remember trying was Sail. It is OK.

I know there are many other blends out there.  Given that the price of
one pouch is usually on the lower side, I would suggest trying several
types to see which one fits your taste better.

****IMPORTANT: do not discard a tobacco immediately if you didn't like
it.  Sometimes the moment is not right for that specific tobacco, or
maybe you will develop a taste for it after a few smokes.  It is the
old trial and error that makes life (and pipes) so rewarding.

Also you may want to call some tobacconists that ship anywhere in the
US.  I know one in NYC (I actually just bought a pipe there today)
that ships tobacco and pipes anywhere.  They have a very good
selection of tobacco.  If you want to give it a try, call him.  He is
very helpful and can indicate a custom blend from his shop that suites
your taste.  Here it is:

	Connoisseur Pipe Shop
	1285 Ave. of the Americas
	New York, NY

	tel:  (212) 247-6054

ask for Ed Burak. He is the owner and maker of the pipes.

By the way, since I am talking about Connoisseur pipes, I would
suggest to anyone who is interested, to give him a call anyway and ask
him to send some literature on his pipes and tobacco blends.  He has a
nice set with the design of his pipes, prices and tobacco.  It is well
worth the call.

Smoke in peace,

- Elias

[ As always, thanks, Elias! -S. ]

Hi -
  I thought I'd finally get around to introducing muself, and maybe stir up
some discussion at the same time.
I've been smoking a pipe for about 6 years now, and I really enjoy it.  I also
go for cigars now and then (ballgames, in particular...).  I gravitate towards
aromatic Cavendish mostly.  I've been smoking a blend from Sir Timothy's in
Chicago area (used to live there and got hooked on it!) called Tipperary (sp?),
though I recently have started trying others again.  I spent last weekend in
Gatlinburg, TN, and visited "The Gatlinburlier Tobacconist".  They have a
pretty smooth blend called CAEDS Cove Cavendish that I sampled.  Haven't
decided which I like better yet.
The Gatlinburlier also had an interesting selection of pipes carved by a local
guy (Weber?) with some intricate faces - old man of the sea type, I guess.  I
wanted (needed?) one, but couldn't cough up the $200 for them.
On another topic, I would like to try my hand at carving my own brian pipes. 
Any tips would be appreciated, as well as sources for briar and stems.
   Later -
     Brian
      ????????@????.???

[ Thanks for the note, Brian! I've heard of Gatlin-Burlier, but
haven't had a chance to visit yet. Sounds fun! Let us know how your
search for the Perfect Blend progresses. -S. ]

<a name="2">Subject: Pipe material sources.</a>

Hello,

I've finaly got something worthwhile to write about.  Brian requested some
information about pipe making and sources.  I've made two pipes so far.  One
that was more or less pre-turned for me (shank and stem fitted, but the bowl
had not been worked) and one from scratch (just out of a hunk of dried 
plant root - briar).  I'm smoking the one I made from scratch now, trying
to put a decent cake in the bowl.  The supplies I got from Pimo, Inc.  The
address is:

			Pimo, Inc.
			P.O. Box 482
			Skokie, IL  60077

			(708) 470-0640

They sell an introductory pipe making book "Pimo's guide to Pipe-Crafting
at home".  Really good book  about some pipe history and where briar 
comes from (after that story you might want to rush out and buy a couple
of pipes before they are all gone), and a must if you are starting from
scratch.

They sell the Plateaux (Blocks of cured briar) and other materials for a 
complete pipe maker.  One of the best tools is the tenon turning tool which
fits tenon and stem together exactly.  A drill press is a good thing to
have.  For the scratch pipe I used, drill press,  table saw, very small
hobby type metal lathe, files, sandpaper et. al.

Haven't tried carving images into a pipe.  For drilling the bowl, I took
a 3/4" spade bit and ground it into a tapered shape.  This worked better
than I had hoped.

Good luck with your project and let us know how it turns out.

Norm

[ Thanks for the word, Norm! I've still got 1 or 2 plateaux from
Pimo's that I hope to turn into pipes someday, when I'm wealthy enough
to have some shop space :-) -S. ]

Hi -
   I have a couple of pipes where the stem is loose in the shank (one
that will actually fall apart!)  Admittedly, these are not expensive
pipes, but I've grown accustomed to them and like them.  Is there some
way to tighten these up?
   On another note, I have a meerschaum pipe that I've been smoking
about once a week for over a year now - when will it start to
color?????  I'm smoking an aromatic cavendish in it.
   Last question - I will be spending about a week in downtown Detroit
(lucky me!) for a trade show soon.  Are there any great pipe shops I
should visit?  I'll actually be staying in Windsor, Ontario.  Any
leads would be appreciated!
   Thanks for the info!

      ?????.??????@????.???

[ Sorry, Brian, only one question allowed per letter! (Just kidding
:-) I'll repost an article about loose stems which was on the
newsgroup earlier. Re the meerschaum, I don't have any personal
experience (don't like meerschaums because they're so delicate), but
I've heard they may take months to color. Last, I don't know how close
this is to Detroit, but you might want to check out:

<a name="5">Subject: Stem repair from the Golden State</a>
[ Reposted from pipes#65, September 14, 1991. -S. ]

I had the fortunate experience to be within a hundred miles of our
dedicated moderator Steve recently when I was called to NY City rather
briskly on business.  With a suit bag in hand,  ready for the drive to
the airport, I decided to sit down at the system and drop a quick email
note for Steve letting him know that I was going to be on the East
Coast.  I suggested a possible meeting, signed off, and headed East.

Later,  when I had been working at the trouble spot for a day,  I
arrived at my hotel room to find a message from Steve.  I quickly
called him and we agreed to meet for dinner the next day.  Elias was
supposed to join us but he had a prior obligation somewhere else.

During our discussion at dinner the topic of loose stems came up.  I
had told Steve that the tobacco shop owner where I first bought my pipe
had taught me a quick fix for a loose stem.  Steve suggested that I
send this out over the mailgroup.  Not a bad suggestion, so here it
is...

I have a problem of having the stems on my pipe becomming loose over
time.  I think this happens because I get a lot of moisture in my
pipe.  (No, I don't remove the stem while the pipe is hot!)  Anyhow,
when I was a beginner I took my first pipe back to the shop and showed
the guy my problem.  I expected a repair job, but he smiled at me and
said, "I'll show you this once, after that you're on your own."

For those of you who don't know or don't care about the names of pipe parts,
here is a picture:  (please disregard the lousy Ansii art)

                                  _____________
                    _________    /   _________/
                   (         )  /   /     ^------------Stem
                   (         ) /\  /         _____          _______
    Bowl --------&gt; (         )/  \/         {     |        |       }
                    (        /   /          { -----      ---       }
                     (__________/ ^         { ----- &lt;    ---       }
                                  |         {_____| |   ^  |_______}  
                                  |                 |   |
                      Shank ------+      Mortise ---+   +--- Tenon

He took my pipe and removed the stem.  He grabbed the thickest pipe cleaner
he had and inserted it into the mouth end of the pipe until it just appeared
at the other end.  Then he lit a match and held it under the stem for a few
seconds (maybe five or so).  The flame never touched the tenon on the stem,
but it did melt the rubber.  After this he quickly pushed the stem against the
counter being careful to hold the stem so that the tenon was as perpendicular
to the counter as possible.  This caused the tenon to bulge a little.

After waiting a few minutes to allow the stem to cool, he grabbed a piece of
sandpaper and started to bring the tenon back down to a size that would fit
the mortise.  When he got close he kept testing the tenon by inserting it
into the mortise.  He cautioned "Never try to force the tenon in,  let it
fit snug, but easy to insert.  Otherwise you'll only end up with a cracked
shank."  (I didn't listen very well because after a year I did crack the
shank on one of my favorite pipes,  but it was repairable with a metel band.)

Once he got the tenon to fit snug, he removed it from the shank and rubbed 
the entire tenon surface with a pencil.  This provided a lubricant (graphite)
and allowed the snug tenon/mortise to fit together nicely.  His last comment
was,  "This 'quick fix' is good for about three times,  after that you are
going to need a new stem."

I would'nt try this method for the first time on your most favorite pipe, but
it does beat sending them in to get repaired.  

[ Thanks for the words from "This Old Pipe", Norm! -S. ]

<a name="6">Subject: Pipes Digest: any collectors out there?</a>

Are there any collectors of rare or collectible pipes out there?
I don't have the time or money to make it to any of the pipe
collectors' shows held around the country, but I would like to
get in touch with anybody in the Pipes Digest mailing list who is
into collecting.  I am, in a small way.

One pipe that I've been on the lookout for is one of the Peterson
Mark Twain collectors' series.  (I'm interested in the "firsts"
in the series, not the "seconds".)  This series came out about
nine years ago.

I've been very impressed by Peterson's Sherlock Holmes series,
both in term of smoking quality and craftsmanship.  That's why
I'd like to add one of the Mark Twains to my collection; I figure
they did as good a job with the Mark Twains as they have with the
Sherlock Holmes.  Does anyone know of a Mark Twain "first" available 
for sale or swap?

Are there any other Peterson smokers/collectors out there?  I've
owned and smoked all the top-shelf brands of pipes, including Dunhills 
and Charatans, but Peterson is still my all-around favorite in terms 
of smokability.  And the Sherlock Holmes series is a cut above even
the standard Peterson.  The Peterson "system" pipes, with the
cavity in the shank to absorb moisture (the innovation that
attracted Mark Twain to the Peterson pipe) smoke great, but I've
also had good luck with the non-System pipes, such as the Kildare.

[ I love Petersons, and have a Mark Twain that I got at a show in
Washington in August. Might I suggest you try Levin Pipes
International? They sell a lot of collectable pipes, and every so
often send out photos of their stock. They also have an "on approval"
ordering policy, which I find very attractive for mail order. Their
address is:

	Levin Pipes International
	RFD 1 Box 565
	West Hill Road

I'm also planning to buy one of the Sherlock Holmes pipes as a present

Hello all of you,

This is my first mail over this list. I heard that there was not much
going on but I still hope that people can help me with some question.
But first the following, I am a cigar smoker (so not a pipe smoker),
but I hope that this is no problem for you. I really enjoy sitting
relaxed and smoke a cigar for an hour.  The most important of this, is
that you can not do anything else!

Furthermore I run an Fidonet BBS (2:500/278) in the Netherlands about
wine, beer, liqour, chees, pipe and cigars. I started 1/2/92 and the
most active part is beer. I even wrote to all cigar-associations in
the Netherlands (and there much, because of our past), and these
people never took the keyboard to look at my BBS:-( This is of course
a real pity:-(. I hope to get on this list a better sounding board.

I am looking for methods how you can taste a cigar in a structured way
(I know some books about wine tasting). I am looking for terms which
can be used to describe the tate of the smoke in a simple way (not to
simple, but simple enough to distinquish a cigar/pipe by its
describtion).

Does somebody have such a structured way of tasting cigars (or pipes)?
The method is the most important and the used terms.

Furthermore do people know about other distributions lists /digest
which handle a good smoke!

All the best,

Victor

[ I'm finally out of words of wisdom, Victor, but perhaps our other
Gentle Readers can help! There is a BBS in the US called the Briar
Patch, which has a (somewhat inactive) pipes thread. The thread is run
by Neil Murray, the same fellow who publishes the Agricultural and
Mechanical Gazette.  I don't think they're on Fidonet, but if you'd
like to call them, it's (313) 340-0814. -S. ]

It's nice to see so much activity on Pipes Digest.  I have a
reaction to Brian Morgan's question about coloring meerschaum
pipes, which is also an opportunity for me to give a plug for
English-type tobacco blends.  :-)

I read in a Tinder Box brochure years ago that blends containing
Latakia (i.e., most English types) tend to color meerschaums more
quickly.  I've never done a side-by-side comparison, but I've had
a meerschaum for two years that I rarely smoke (maybe 2 or 3
times a month), but it's still on the way toward being nicely 
colored.  You might want to try an English type to see if it
speeds up the coloration.  Dunhill Standard Mild or Medium, and
Rattray's Professional Mixture are mild, and not a whole lot
stronger than your aromatic cavendish.  Also, the combination of
latakia and the distinctive patina that meerschaum imparts to the
smoke is a unique (and I think delicious) taste experience.

OK, enough of my etitist Anglophilic ranting. 

Steve, thanks for the address of Levin Pipes International.  I'll
drop them a line.

I believe that Barclay, my local tobacconist, has a few of the 
Sherlock Holmes series still in stock.  Their address is:

	Barclay Pipe and Tobacco
	1677 West Lane Avenue M-12
	Columbus, Ohio 43221
	(614) 486-4243

First of all, I would like to say thanks to Steve for allowing me the
opportunity to become a member of the group. I have had a love affair
with the pipe ever since my navy days. I own Petersons, Butz-Choquins,
a Savinelli, Pioneer Calabashes, clays (broke all of them), and of course
a handcrafted meerschaum. As for as Tobacco goes, I am still looking for
the Holy Grail, but I have discovered that I have a soft spot for anything
with a fair share of Latakia in the mixture. Around my house, you will
find dozens of empty tins of the various English blends. Enough of this.

There was a Gentleman, who left a note inquiring as to how long it will
take a meerschaum to stain. There is no easy answer. I have given up on
my Calabashes. After years of smoking they seem no worst for the wear,
but on the otherhand my meerschaum is coming along nicely. The shank and
the top of the bowl have in a few weeks turned a nice brown. If I may I
would like to pass along a few hints. These hints are not mine but come from
the "The Ultimate Pipe Book" by Richard Carleton Hacker.
1. Do not allow any cake to form inside the bowl. Any cake will only
   impede the coloring process.
2. As you smoke your pipe blow the smoke on the pipe. Mr. Hacker claims
   this will speed up the process.
Also, I suspect not all meerschaum is equal. If after a few months the pipe
shows no signs of behaving,you may have something other than quality
meerschaum. I hope this is not the case.

		 Pipes Digest #84 - November 7, 1992

For once, we don't have any new members between postings! But we're up
to 59 members now - not an all-time high, but pretty darn good, IMHO!
Which brings me to the following (fanfare please)...

ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE:	(don't that look official? Even officious? :-) 
--------------------

IF your email address changes, and you'd like to keep on receiving the
Digest, please let me know your new address! I've been able to track
down a few members who've moved, but this has been the exception
rather than the rule. If someone's mail starts bouncing, I have no
choice but to drop them from the mailgroup.

And now, after that heavy Latakia-like note, let's lighten up (and
light up) with Martin and Douglas!

Fellow Fumeurs,

In recent months I find my interests turning more in the direction
of fine cigars, but I've been sadly unmethodical in exploring the
field.  I've discovered that my tastes do appear to have a
definition:  relatively short (6.5" or less), fat (48 ring or
greater), mild but aromatic (usually Dominican), hand-rolled, with a
preference for a Maduro wrapper.  The stinging intensity of a
smuggled Cuban "Cohiba" I smoked a couple of months ago did not
please me.  Can anyone suggest a cigar that I might like, within
that range?  How about one outside of that range, and what are its
characteristics?  Further, in one of the mail order catalogs I saw a
reference to a "bullseye cutter".  I normally use a guillotine, and
have seen piercers and vee-cutters, but this is apparently something
different from any of those.  How does it work?  Thanks ...

Hi Steve,
 
I was wondering if any of the members of this mailgroup live in Southeastern
Michigan (where I live.)

[ Can't say, Stefan; the only info I keep on members is in the form of
email addresses and past submissions. This is for the protection of
the members, just in case the government criminalizes posession of
tobacco :-) Anyone else here from Michigan?  -S. ]

Hello Martin,

Ik hope I can help you.

&gt;In recent months I find my interests turning more in the direction
&gt;of fine cigars, but I've been sadly unmethodical in exploring the
&gt;field.  

It is rather difficult indeed, I am also trying to find THE cigar. But it
seems that the FIRST cigar I smoked is still the best! When I was in San Jose,
there was an excellent bookshop/cigarshop which sells a lot of cigars (I think
some 50 brands). All coming from Dominicans, Cannary isles, Mexico, etc. But
non from Cuba (is that not allowed in US?) and not from Holland!

I am coming from the Netherlands, so my first cigar was also a Dutch one
(Balmoral), and as I said above this is still the one I prefer. I am still
searching of course for better ones, but Cubans and all other 'puros' lack
something, they are quiet flat in there smell/flovour/taste. And furthermore
I think they are quiet heavy. From most Cuban cigars I become sick :-( (Cuesta
Rey, Quintero [this is the best Cuban until now], Romeo y Julieta, H. Upmann).

So I would recommend you of course a Dutch cigar. The best coronas, in my
opinion are: Justis van Maurik, Balmoral, Schimmelpenninck, De Huifkar (in
that order).  German cigar are quiet heavy in my opinion and Spanish cigar are
not so bad (although they are quiet 'puros').

But I am still open for other ideas of course! So let me know your chooses!

Furthermore: do you have ideas how to describe the smell/taste of
cigars/pipes. It is all smokey;-), but that does not make a difference. In
wine one has a lot of describing terms, but the only ones I know for cigars
is: Java, cuban, etc. tates/smells, but that does not say enough! I hope we
could get some swapping of ideas also on this matter.  

&gt;I've discovered that my tastes do appear to have a
&gt;definition:  relatively short (6.5" or less), fat (48 ring or
&gt;greater), mild but aromatic (usually Dominican), hand-rolled, with a

Most of the above mentioned Dutch cigars are some 12 cm (some 5 "), corona
type (12 mm, 1/2"), mild and hand role (not all). They are made from at least
some 5 tabaccos (havana, brasil, java, sumatra, etc.). What is the meaning of
48 ring???

&gt;preference for a Maduro wrapper.  

This is difficult for me, I do not have any reference on this colours. I read
about it in a book, but what the color is, I do not know. Do you have some
colored flyer about cigar colors? If so let me know, I will forward my
snail-mail address.

All the best,
Victor

[ Thanks for the update, Victor! BTW, I understand that there are some
books on cigars, and even a "Cigar Connoisseur" magazine. Can other
members shed some light on cigar descriptives? -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: re: Pipes Digest #84 - November 7, 1992</a>

Steve,

As regards Martin Lodahl's request for maduro cigar
recommendations....  Arturo Fuentes makes a good maduro 
Rothschilds in that size range, rather ostentatiously wrapped 
in a slice of cedar wood.  La Unica also makes a (much cheaper)
maduro in about that size.

If you're really into maduro cigars, I'd highly recommend
Macanudo maduros and Royal Jamaica maduros.  I don't think they
conform to your size &amp; shape preferences, but they are excellent
cigars.  They have the characteristic maduro flavor, but are
milder than other maduros.  Kind of expensive, though.  I can
only afford these once in a while.

As for Roug Mayo's request for high-Latakia English blends....
Dunhill Nightcap is pretty heavy in Latakia, I seem to recall.
Balkan Sobranie No. 759 (the black label) also has a lot of
Latakia.  So does Rattray's Black Mallory, but it's so strong
that I can't finish a bowl of it.

If you try some of these, I'd recommend them as an evening smoke.  
These are 'way too strong for the morning, at least for me.  I
usually smoke medium blends like Rattray's Professional during
the day, and smoke the heavier blends once in a while, in the 
evening.  But some people can handle the heavier blends better 
than I can.

While we're on the subject of tobacco, has anybody else tried the
Esoterica Tobbaciana blends, recently imported from England?
They're a few more dollars than average English blends but worth
it in my book.  My favorite is Pembroke, a medium-to-full latakia
blend flavored with a little cognac.  Yumyumyum.  Margate is a
heavy blend, with a lot of latakia.

[ Thanks for your update, Steve! Hope that you or some of our other
readers can point us toward a source of the Esoterica, for the

<a name="2">Subject: Re: Pipes Digest #85 - November 14, 1992</a>
 
In Pipes Digest #85, Victor Reijs offered some excellent suggestions
on cigars, asking:

&gt; non from Cuba (is that not allowed in US?) and not from Holland!

Cuban cigars have been forbidden, alas, in the U.S.A. for some 30
years now.  They do find their way in, usually smuggled in from
Canada.

&gt; 	... Cubans and all other 'puros' lack
&gt; something, they are quiet flat in there smell/flovour/taste. And furthermore
&gt; I think they are quiet heavy. From most Cuban cigars I become sick :-( 

My experience exactly.  

&gt; &gt;I've discovered that my tastes do appear to have a
&gt; &gt;definition:  relatively short (6.5" or less), fat (48 ring or
&gt; &gt;greater) ...
&gt; 
&gt; 	... What is the meaning of 48 ring???

Cigar makers use the same measure of the diameter of the cigar that
jewelers use for finger rings.  "48 ring" = 48/64 of an inch, or
3/4", or ~18mm.

&gt; &gt;preference for a Maduro wrapper.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is difficult for me, I do not have any reference on this colours. I read
&gt; about it in a book, but what the color is, I do not know. Do you have some
&gt; colored flyer about cigar colors? If so let me know, I will forward my
&gt; snail-mail address.

I don't have such a thing, but I have a description in words.  What
follows is what I've gathered from an article written by Lew
Rothmann in the summer catalog of the JR Tobacco Company:

*  Claro claro, claro, jade, Cambridge, Candela, American Market
Selection (AMS):  All these mean a light green wrapper, once favored
by the American market.

*  Claro, Natural, English Market Selection (EMS), Oxford Cafe,
English Claro, Rare Corojo, Spanish Claro:  A light brown wrapper. 
As you can see, imaginative marketing has led to more than a little
confusion.

*  Colorado Claro, Natural, EMS, Oxford, Cafe, Spanish Claro,
Rosado:  Brown wrapper.

*  Colorado, Natural, EMS, Oxford, Cafe, Spanish Claro, Rosado:  The
next degree darker brown, presumably.

*  Colorado Maduro, EMS, Maduro:  Dark brown wrapper.

*  Maduro, Spanish Market Selection (SMS):  Nearly black wrapper.

*  Oscuro, Maduro Maduro, Extra Oscuro:  Absolutely black wrapper.

Which all goes to show that if you see a cigar in a catalog with
what's described as a "Natural wrapper", they haven't really told
you much that you can use.

And Steve Houser suggested:

&gt; As regards Martin Lodahl's request for maduro cigar
&gt; recommendations....  Arturo Fuentes makes a good maduro 
&gt; Rothschilds in that size range, rather ostentatiously wrapped 
&gt; in a slice of cedar wood.  La Unica also makes a (much cheaper)
&gt; maduro in about that size.

I've never been disappointed in an Arturo Fuentes, though sometimes
surprised at the price.  I'll give the La Unica a try, too.

&gt; If you're really into maduro cigars, I'd highly recommend
&gt; Macanudo maduros and Royal Jamaica maduros.  I don't think they
&gt; conform to your size &amp; shape preferences, but they are excellent
&gt; cigars.  They have the characteristic maduro flavor, but are
&gt; milder than other maduros.  Kind of expensive, though.  I can
&gt; only afford these once in a while.

My cigar club has bought both, and they are indeed fine cigars.
I'm not sure that we'll be buying more, though, as the rest of the
group seems headed in a double-claro to EMS sort of direction, while
I'm going more EMS to Maduro.

Thanks, all!

(Us Californians are pretty clever people).  Fun place to go.  Never heard

Hello all of you,

Thanks Steve for your reference to Cigar Connoisseur'. Do you have
more information on this one (price, where to get it, etc.). I have
the idea that there are not many books on cigars (there are more in
pipes;-).
The books I have are:
The book of the Havana cigar, B. Innes, 1983, Orbis Publishing,
London, ISBN 0-85613-546-1
Zigarren-Brevier oder Was raucht der Connaisseur, Z. Davidoff, 1991,
Mohndruck, Guetersloh, ISBN 3-7014-0751-7

(the real prices are not known, because I bought both at second hand
bookshops)

The last book is, I think, originaly in French, but perhaps there is
also an English version.

Both books handle Havana cigars, I never have found a book about
Brazil or Dutch cigars. I am thinking of trying to get together some
people in the Netherlands to print a book (in the style of present
wine quide books [incl. some 'touristic' info]).

If people know about others cigar books, please let me know (if possible
some indication of the price).

All the best,

Victor

[ Victor, all the information I have about the magazine is that the
name of the publisher is Marvin R. Shanken, who also publishes "Wine
Spectator." (There's an article about him, and "Cigar Connoisseur," in
the September 21 issue of _Newsweek_; that's how I found out.)  But if
you call up the information desk at your local library, they might be
able to help.  Please let us know if you find out, and thanks for the
book references! -S. ]

Hello! As requested in the opening letter here's a brief explanation of myself
and why I am interested in the discussion here.

I am a 38 year old white male, born and raised in New Jersey but living in San
Francisco since 1980. I did a stint as a tobacconist while completing a degree
in History back in the late 70's. I worked for Wally Frank in their retail
store in Paramus, NJ. My involvement with pipes and cigars has dwindled since
then, especially after I became involved in judging homebrewed beers and needed
to preserve my palate. Nevertheless I have always appreciated the craft and
maintain my pipe collection, imbibing on the rare occasion. My tobacco of
choice is Rattrays Red Rap. I find it mixes well with a dram of Prime Malt in
the late evening.

Hello all of you,

Here is the address of that cigar shop (and I though I have seen that
also pipes, and pipe tabacco): it is Downtown Tabacco &amp; News, 70 East
Santa Clara St, San Jose, CA 95113, (408)295-2277.

The cigars I bought there were:
A. Fuente, De cassio Teides, Te-am, Juan Lopez, Costa Rey. He had much
more. And I had the bad-luck that I only wrote the names down when
being home (and some of my cigars were stolen in the plane, so :-()

If someone is going to visit this shop, do the greetings to mister
Louis Chendler, I had a nice talk with about cigars, and offer him
some Dutch cigars (which he liked very much:-).

A disclamer, I have no commerciel binding to the above mentioned
shop;-)

All the best,

Victor

[ Thanx, Victor! -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Hello and Loose Bits</a>

Hello all, from one of the new guys on the list.

Perhaps one of you briar-wise persons out there can shed some light on
a curiosity with one of my pipes.

But first a little background.  I have been smoking pipes on and off
for the past 30 years (I started when I three! I wish!!!).  I am
recently coming off one of the 'off' times.  It's been about 8 years
since I was regularly smoking my pipes.  Throughout those 8 years the
pipes have been boxed away in the basement.

Upon unpacking them, I picked up one of my favorites to give it a 
gentle caress and, the bit falls out!  I couldn't figure out for
the life of me why it should have become so loose.

The bit is nylon (I think that's the material they are made of???),
a nice, iridesent variegation of creams and browns.  It was in 
good shape, so I hated the thought of having to have a new one 
made for the pipe.

So I decided to put a little of my analytical prowess to work.
(always a dangerous proposition!!)  I figured when wood gets wet,
it swells.  Perhaps if I soaked the stem of pipe, it would also
swell, thereby making a tighter fit for the bit.  So, at the
risk of ruining the finish, I stuck the stem in water for about
a day.

Returning with great expectations, I stuck the bit into the pipe
and it was as loose as ever.  At that point I pretty much
resolved myself to having a new stem made.  However, a few days
later I came back to the pipe and lo and behold, the bit was as
snug as ever.

Now I would have figured that the stem would have swelled while
it was sitting 'in' the water but, that was not the case - it
was not until the stem was 'out' of the water for a few days
did the swelling take place.

So, back to the reason of this post - is this normal for briar?
Also, it seems strange that only one pipe out of the bunch
turned up loose.

Well enough rambling for now....
Once again, a smokey hello to all...

[ First off, thanks for your post! Second off, please excuse me, but
I'm mildly horrified. ((8-O Water is what causes the stems to become
loose in the first place.  Taking a pipe apart when it's hot and
getting goo up the shank is bad enough news, but you _really_
shouldn't soak a pipe in water!

There are two more orthodox ways to deal with loose stems - have a pro
make a new one, or expand the old stem with heat. Your stem material
sounds like acrylic, which is fairly common. And I've run into repair
people who claim to be able to duplicate any stem. Contact:

I'll send you a back article on stem repair from Norm, if you'd rather
go the second route. -S. ]

Howdy, I'm new here.  I figure I'll lurk more than I submit -- at least
for the time being, but there was a suggestion that I let the order know
what I'm about ...

I'm another one of those homebrew fiends that wandered over.  I'm 24
yrs old, currently work in Pierre, SD -- I hope to end up in a REAL
city in the next year or so.  I smoked a pipe off and on for about 4 
years ending this past spring.  I put it away for a while, and I've
irrationally let a woman's views on tobacco influence me into not enjoying
the occasional recreational bowl or two.  (Support is welcome :-)

I'm not too knowledgeable about things -- I guess I know I like vanilla
in my tobacco, and I'll accept any advice on what to look for in a reasonably
priced pipe.

That's all -- I'm glad to be here!

<a name="2">Subject: East Lansing pipe shop</a>

	I was in East Lansing, Michigan, today and had the opportunity to
visit Campbell's Smoke Shop, a small, pipe-specialty shop, but which
offers cigars and cigarettes as well.  Someone on this list asked if
there were any Michigan members, and this is my response.
	Campbell's is in Block One of M.A.C Avenue, just off Grand River
Avenue, which goes by the Michigan State campus.  It offers about 30
types of tobacco, and has 200-300 pipes for sale.  According to a
brochure I picked up the pipes are made by Savinelli, Peterson,
Stanwell, CAO, Clairmont and Wiley.  They also offer Savinelli
Seconds, and Savinelli makes pipes to the specifications of the shop.
They handle mail orders as well.  (The zip code is 48823 if you want
to write to them.)
	There seem to be few pipe shops in Michigan.  This is the only
one I've been to, and so I have no way to judge it.  It's a heck of a
step up from supermarkets, though.  All of the employees are always
friendly and helpful, and willing to answer questions.  They seem
knowledgeable to me.  It's a nice place.

Hello Michael and others,

You did an excellent experient. and the results are
indead what one could expect. Wood is becoming bigger
while nylon is becoming smaller, when wet (if you are
sometimes camping, one can also see this after a wet
day, the nylon tents will be nicely tight, while the
cottons are miserable looking;-).

If this experiment is oke for the pipe, I do not
know;-)

Related to this (or not related, I do not know), is
the following:
While smoking a cigars it sometimes happens that the
sucking on the cigar becomes more difficult. I say
becomes, because in the beginning it sucks normal and
and after the difficult part it again becomes normal.
I can not say when the difficult part will happen!

I really do not know what reason there is, why this
happens (does it have to do will heat, way of
manifacturing the cigar, wetness, ...). Because a
pipe is even more handmade, does one also experience
this kind of things while smoking a pipe???

All the best,

Victor

[ Sounds like the same thing as pipes, Victor; little bits of tobacco
getting stuck, then coming free. -S. ]

<a name="5">Subject: re. loose stems</a>

Well after being properly and thoroughly chastised by our moderator
for the soaking the shank (I even used the right word this time) of
my pipe in water, I PROMise - I'll never do THAT again!  Seriously
though, I never realized that it was water/moisture that caused 
the stem to become loose.  As I postulated in my orginal post, it
seems the shank should swell as it became damp.  I suppose what's
going is that the inside diameter of the shank is actually enlarging
rather decreasing as it swells - I guess that makes sense.

At any rate, thanks for straighting me out Steve.

ps  Please send a copy of your 'generic how-to article' - I think
    I might need it!  Thanks-

<a name="6">Subject: Pipe making video</a>

Just got a video on how to make a pipe, from an outfit called HTV in
Dover, Delaware. The video is _very_ homebrew, but at least somewhat
informative; I learned some things I didn't know before, such as how
to clean tripoli off a buffing wheel.

The guy who made the video is a garage woodcarver, certainly no Norm
Abram, though he did OK with the tools he had. I guess the video was
worth it, since I was inspired to read the Pimo's book more closely
afterward. :-)

Ah, well, for the days when I have a real home and a workshop, instead
of a dorm room. Coming soon, I hope! Each day brings us a little
closer. So, until the next time,

Steve,

This isn't really related to pipes (as far as I know), but your
mentioning the upcoming completion of your thesis has me
wondering what you're getting your degree in.  

I'm interested in this kind of stuff because I've been feeling a
sweet nostalgia for graduate school.  We live right next to Ohio
State University, and my wife has gone back to complete her BA.
Since you're still in the middle of the fray, you could probably
cure my nostaliga with a dose of reality.  :-)

Hello Steve,

Could told in the last pipes digest that the effect of difficult
sucking of a cigar could be compaired to what happens in a pipe, when
something obstructs the pipe. But I do not understand how you can
compare this in a cigar? I do not see how tabacco could do that, or is
the tabacco wronbgly roled so that there is at some place to much
tabacco, and when this tabocco gets hot, it enlarges, could that be
the reason??? Are there people who have some scientific explanation?

All the best,

Victor

[ It might swell as it gets wet, or a piece of tobacco might break off
and get lodged in some part of the cigar. That's my opinion, as a
non-expert; anyone have any more informed ideas? -S. ]

&gt; Subject: obstruction in cigar
&gt; 
&gt; Could told in the last pipes digest that the effect of difficult
&gt; sucking of a cigar could be compaired to what happens in a pipe, when
&gt; something obstructs the pipe. But I do not understand how you can
&gt; compare this in a cigar? 

&gt; Are there people who have some scientific explanation?

Yes, but let me give my answer first.
 
The most common cause of cigar blockage (constipanatella, as the ancient 
Romans termed it) is nothing more complicated than that some overworked 
Honduran cigar maker has carelessly rolled a live tobacco worm (actually,
a caterpillar, but I'm sticking with the vernacular) into the cigar.  For
those who've never seen one, an adult tobacco worm is about a half inch 
(12.7mm) around and one to two inches long, shaded in a putrid green.  
They're the only terrestrial life form that can survive eating tobacco (try
it yourself if you don't believe me) and they look about like you'd expect
something that lives on tobacco to look like.  

Anyway, the adults are so big that they're hard to miss; usually it's just
little caterpillars that get rolled up.  Mostly they get squished; after a
month or two the juices get soaked up by the cigar.  The dessicated husk
that remains doesn't prevent smoking the cigar, although a slightly pungent
or putrid flavor may remain.

Sometimes the tobacco worm survives the trauma of being rolled up.  If it
does, it finds itself in tobacco worm heaven, and usually responds by
eating a cavity into the cigar.  If you like your cigars fresh, then a
blocked stogie probably indicates the presence of a live, near-adult worm.
That's the better of your two options.

Given time, the caterpillar will mature, spin a coccoon, and change into
a butterfly.  They're actually quite lovely, marked with purple and gold
and scarlet, but it hardly matters because you're only going to see it for
a couple of seconds as it shoots from the end of your lit cigar, bursts
into flames, and falls lifeless to the floor, leaving a trail of acrid
smoke.

Anyway, I don't mean to sound alarmist.  This rarely happens; heck, I've
only seen it a couple of times myself, and it's not really *that* gross
once you get used to it.

Enjoy! 8-)

<a name="3">Subject: no subject (file transmission)</a>

In regards to a previous request for information about pipe shops
in Michigan, and in response to John Perry's input about
Campbell's Smoke Shop in particular.

I know of three shops in Michigan:

There is a shop in the mall in Battle Creek which has a variety
of blends, as well as a decent collection of pipes, especially
carved meershaum ones. I've purchased a couple of pipes there,
including a decent meershaum job, though I've really come to the
conclusion that meershaum is just too darn soft to make a day to
day pipe out of.  Battle Creek is a smallish town, and you can't
miss the Mall if you drive down I94.  The mall is just South of
the express way.

The second shop I know of is in the ground floor of the Fisher
building next door to General Motors headquarters in downtown
Detroit. This shop also sells small snack items (gum, candybars,
etc.) and is really a cigar shop, not a pipe shop. Not having
been there in a couple of years I can't recall if they even sell
house blends of pipe tobacco.  The cigar collection on the other
hand is decent.

Third there is Campbell's Smoke Shop in East Lansing. Campbell's
is a nice place with a polite staff. (I detest snobbish store
clerks) I recently went in with a friend and we both bought new
Savanelli pipes there, as well as a few varieties of tobbaco. I
particularly like blend #2 (a full English blend, though a bit
harsh), blend #16 (English and American tobaccos), and blend #23
(a nice flavorful blend that has almost no bite). I also
purchased a half dozen cigars, relying upon the advise of the
shopkeeper.  Though decent, I've come to the conclusion that I'm
just not a cigar smoker, I'm a pipe man.

I've smoked a pipe for about ten years, but have only recently
moved beyond the standard store bought 'Dr. Grabow' pipes. I'm
truly amazed at how much better a quality pipe draws and stays
lit. Speaking of staying lit, I've come to the conclusion that
the bigger the bowl the better. I have a new pipe with a bowl
that has roughly the volume of 1 1/2 golf balls, and it is a far
more pleasant smoke than any previous pipe I've had.

I'd like to close with a couple of conversations starters, refering
back to a couple of my comments above:

	1)  What is the general opinion of meershaum pipes?

	2)  Big bowls vs. little bowls.

[ Thanks for the word, Robert! Regarding your questions, I personally
don't like meerschaums, because of the delicacy you mentioned, and
also because the bits are too hard and don't chomp very well. I also
prefer big versus little bowls at different times, depending on my
mood. However, as they say in the TV editorials, we welcome opposing
viewpoints... -S. ]

From: Gary
<a name="4">Subject:  Question #1</a>

My question revolves around the matter of opinions.  I have learned the pipe
smoking trade through the fairly traditional blue collar manner.  By this, I
mean that I learned upon "Dr. Garbow" pipes and "Sir Walter Raleigh Pipe
Tobacco".  I still use both predominately, and learned the "art" from the
similar experiences of my father and grandfather.  My questions are...

1)  What is the impression that the "elite" have of the Dr. Garbow line?
Is there an inherent loss of quality as compared with more pricey pipes?  Or,
perhaps is the value only that of greater "artistry" in the more
expensive pipes?

2)  Sir Walter Raliegh is an inexpensive tobacco that seems to be
different from "gourmet" brands mainly in the cut.  In SWR the cut
is like that of small squares, while the "gourmet" brands usually
have a more shag-rug apperance.  SWR seems to need less "tending" to than the
gourmet blends and seems heavier.  What are your impressions in comparing the
SWR brand with others?

[ Welcome to the group, Gary! I don't remember trying SWR (except in
ham radio .... ..), but it sounds like a "cube cut" tobak. Nothing
wrong with that, in and of itself. -S. ]

Thanks for the dose of reality.  I'd forgotten how much of a pain

<a name="4">Subject: Another Michigan pipe shop</a>

	I've found another Michigan pipe shop.  Between Rob Sweet and I,
we're going to make Michigan a Mecca for pipe smokers.  (-:

	In downtown Ann Arbor, there's a small row of shops known as
Nickel's Arcade, and there is found the Maison Edwards Tobaconist.
It's a pleasant little place, but with an excellent selection of
pipes, about 40 different kinds of tobacco, and a very friendly and
highly knowledgeable staff.  They also have a shelf of pre-owned
pipes, and they do repairs on pipes as well.
	I was there on Christmas Eve, picking out a last-minute present
for my brother, and I was a little surprised they were open.  I asked
for advice on both a pipe and a tobacco, and got a thorough
explanation of both.  I could have spent much more time there, but
unfortunately was in a bit of a hurry.
	The proprietor explained something I've never understood: why do
some pipes cost $20 and others cost several hundred?  He told me it
was a choice of wood, which I'd figured.  Further, though, he told me,
the better pipes are made from the denser wood near the center of the
tree, and the best come from the smoothest grained wood.  "Seconds"
are made from wood with knots in it, or from softer wood.  He showed
me the grains of some different pipes, and told me of pipes he'd seen
with holes burned through the side where a knot was present.
	I'll be back there, soon I hope.

I really enjoyed the story about the tobacco worm in the cigar that was told
in the 90th issue.

If you have the time, I (and perhaps others (unless you have already talked
about it)), would be interested in hearing more about the "tobacco tea"
experiment.

From: Steve Masticola (???????????????????????)
<a name="6">Subject: Tea, or another way _not_ to enjoy tobak...</a>

At Gary's request, here's a report on the infamous Tobacco Tea
experiment. Warning: the following passage should be read only by
those with strong stomachs or lots of Pepto-Bismol...

When I was a freshman in college, I occasionally conducted strange
science experiments, mostly motivated by boredom. F'r instance, there
was the time I used an undershirt as a lampshade, nearly causing the
firetrucks to investigate... or tried to see how many pipes I could
keep alight at once (three)... Harmless, but wierd.

In any case, one dull night I looked at my coffeepot, then at a pouch
of Amphora, and a light bulb went on. (Fortunately, the T-shirt was
nowhere in evidence.) So I disemboweled a teabag, filled it with
tobak, stapled it back together, soaked it in boiling water, and
attempted to partake.

Ever gotten pipe juice on your tongue? That just about describes the
effect.  I believe I might have gotten two swallows down; I was
pretty, ah, ill for an hour or so afterward. I would not recommend the
practice.

On the other hand, when I was a little kid (talking 8-10 years old,
now, when tobacco was difficult and dangerous to obtain :-), I would
sometimes turn the tables, and smoke some tea in a pipe. (That's
Orange Pekoe, not what you're thinking. :) It wasn't a particularly
good smoke, but at least it didn't give me the spins. Did anyone else
ever do this, I wonder?

Moral of the story: _Drink_ the tea, _smoke_ the tobacco. Don't get
mixed up on this point! But, whatever you do,

				Smoke in peace,
				~\U Steve.

<a name="2">Subject: Smoke Shops</a>

Since I grew up in the Boston area, I'm surprised that 
nobody has mentioned those bastions of pipe smoking:

David P. Ehrlich (Downtown Boston)

Leavitt &amp; Pierce (Harvard Square, affiliated with Ehrlich)

Peretti's  (Boston area. Two (?) stores.)

They have/had a very good mail order service. At least
they did the last time I checked. I used to know all
of Ehrlich's blends, and they seem to have a blend for
just about any taste, from mild cavendish and flavored
cavendish to burley to virginias and turkish and english
styles. I don't quite know what's in their "D.P.E.", 
but there seems to be a little bit of everything, and it
is a good smoke for people who want more than a
burley or cavendish. I used to buy blending tobaccos,
and experimented with burley and virginia bases with
some turkish or latakia or perique. Unless you're a
real dedicated pipe smoker it's easier to stick with
"known" blends. There's nothing as smooth as the
Dunhill or Balkan Sobranie blends, though some of the
"house" blends are quite nice, and a lot less expensive.
I used to like Ehrhich's "Number 68" blend a lot. (medium
English blend)

I wonder if people in the Boston area are subscribing to 
this group. Let me know if any are. I don't have the addresses
for the companies mentioned above, but I can look them up
in my files. I just moved from one side of the Bay to the
other, and I have to update my mail order catalog addresses.
I woudn't publish the commentary above since it's based on
non-recent recollections. O.K. to include it if you get
some info from Boston. I just got a job at U.C. Berkeley
( no, Berkeley hasn't banned outdoor smoking, (yet)) and
I am looking into the local scene. Still haven't found any
better than the mail order places, but it's hard to sample
from 3000 miles away. Unless you order a sampler, memory 
has to suffice. Whelan's is just off campus. I'll have to
sample their wares someday. Until then, I'll work on that
Sobranie.

<a name="3">Subject: EPA antismoker ruling</a>

Well, here we go again.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week classified
"environmental tobacco smoke" as a class 1 carcinogen, in the same
class as radon and asbesdos. This from the same government that
classifies marijuana as a schedule A narcotic (along with heroin and
crack), and once classified ketchup as a vegetable.

Now, I'm not in favor of making other folks uncomfortable, and do not
generally smoke where it would be objectionable to anybody. But the
EPA's risk assessment is faulty, and they know it. The only thing it
proves is that the EPA does not like smokers. Unfortunately, a lot of
people are going to believe it, and we can expect another wave of
tobacco-bashing and further restrictions.

In order to prevent some of that, I'm passing along the following
information. They show that most people voluntarily expose themselves
to risks a lot worse than smoke, every day of their lives. Please
circulate it wherever you feel it would do some good. And, at least
until the Government outlaws it,

not disgusted, by the huge effort and resources that have been and are
being devoted to try and distinguish between 'a very low cancer risk'
and 'no' cancer risk, from ETS.

having got their priorities wrong and thereby delayed progress toward
solving much more serious problems."

Steve,

I would like you to email me a copy of your article on pipe smokers being
healthier than non-pipe smokers.  I just want to know for my own benifit.
I don't get on the soap box one way or the other on this issue.  I do
believe that secondary smoke is probably harmful to others (as well as myself)
and therefore choose not to smoke indoors (especially in my house with my
kids around).  At home, I usually reserve my smoking for the garage 
(actually a wood shop, a car has never lived there since I bought the house).
Commute times are my other most enjoyable smoking time.  I just wish I could
offer some same sort of environment control on other forms of air pollution
such as car exhaust.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could limit the exhaust to
the confines of the street?  Anyway,  send the article along if you will.

I hope the dissertation and all your fun are going well.  I fear for the
day when you will have to join the rest of us.

Norm

[ Thanks for the note, Norm, and 'scuze me if I've been getting a bit
too soapboxy lately. We pipe smokers should demonstrate that we are
considerate as we enjoy, and you do that amply well. Degree's going
fine; expect to defend in April. -S. ]

Hello to all members of the pipes mailgroup !

Since I am new to this mailgroup, I will give you some information
about me and my interests in pipes and pipe smoking.

I Ave read about the Internet pipes mailgroup in the Pipe SmokerAs
Ephemeris, which I ordered after the reading of Rich Hackers excellent
"Ultimate Pipe Book". I am a graduate student at the Institute of
Theoretical Chemistry of the University of Tuebingen in Germany. In
our group, we are interested in the interactions of proteins with
water, and especially, the protein folding process.

I am a pipe smoker since I finished school, about ten years ago. I own
about 30 pipes of different manufacturers (Stanwell, Savinelli,
Brebbia, Peterson, Dunhill, ...). My favorite tobaccos are: Dunhill My
Mixture 965, CrownAs Achievement and Balkan Sobranie Smoking Mixture,
but because my wife doesnAt like their strong smell, I smoke LarsenAs
Premium pipe tobacco at home, and I am always looking for an english
mixture with a danish smell (suggestions are welcome !).

In recent years, I started to build a small collection of books about
pipe smoking, tobacco and related themes. Up to now I have only german
books, but I have contacted Ben Rapaport (Antiquarian Tobacciana) to
complete my collection with foreign language books.

I am also a member of the local pipe smokers club, the "Stuttgarter
Pfeifenfreunde B79". Our meetings take place every second friday in
the month.  If someone wants to join our meetings, feel free to
contact me.

ItBs an exciting experience to communicate with pipe smokers all over
the world. Please let me know, if somebody is more interested in
whatBs going on in the pipe smoking area in Germany.

Keep on smoking !

Cheerio Thomas.

[ Sounds great, Thomas! Hope some of our European and other members
will look up the Stuttgarter Pfeifenfreunde B79 (is that '79?) when in
the area.  -S. ]

From: NEIL MURRAY (no Internet address)
<a name="3">Subject: Dr. Grabow and Medico Pipes</a>

One frequent question which I noticed in the Internet pipes mailgroup
postings has to do with Dr. Grabow pipes.  Now, this may come as a shock to
those who only buy Savenilli Signatures, but Medico and Grabow do sell a
fairly decent pipe.  I know, you are thinking to yourself, "Oh no, I just
blew a $1000 note and I could have bought a Medico and a new used car."  If
one shops selectively, there are good quality Medico and Grabow pipes which
if properly broken in will taste just as good as a pipe made in Italy,
France, England, or Denmark.  I have a variety of moderately expensive pipes
in my collection, nothing outrageous, but fair stuff, and I still think that
one of the best pipes that I used to own was a filtered Medico which I had
while i was in the Air Force.  A college student or person in the service
should not waste their limited funds on a questionably expensive pipe.
Another alternative is Wiley Pipes of Florida, they make a good pipe for a
reasonable price.  All for now, i got to go,
       Neil

[ I found this on the Briar Patch BBS (313-340-0814), and copied it
here, given the interest people have in Dr. Grabows. -S. ]

&gt; Now, this may come as a shock to
&gt; those who only buy Savenilli Signatures, but Medico and Grabow do sell a
&gt; fairly decent pipe.  

I should say so!  There'll be no bad-mouthing Dr. Grabows in this list, not
if I have anything to say about it.  A Dr. Grabow pipe saved the life of 
one of my ancestors.  

It was my great-uncle, Zachariah Thacker.  Uncle Zack was an impetuous
young man, so when American announced its entry into the World War (which
is what they called World War I at the time; obviously, WWII hadn't
happened yet.  If it had, then it wouldn't have been WWII, eh?) he
immediately volunteered.

I'd love to tell you the whole story about how he managed to pass the
medical despite the fact that a childhood accident with a threshing machine
had left his left leg some four inches shorter than his right.  But this
is the Pipe Digest, so I'll stick to the point, which is that just before
he shipped out his fiance' presented him with a Dr. Grabow filter-stem and
two ounces of Tinder Box Anniversary blend(*).  She teased that the horrid
cherry stench ought to chase those perfume-drenched French girls away from
him. 8-)

	(*) It's a little-known fact that The Tinder Box hasn't produced its 
	Anniversary blend since 1909.  There were bumper crops of tobacco
	and cherries that year, so they mixed up "a batch," and have been
	selling it ever since.  

As you might imagine, Uncle Zack was none too fond of mechanical equipment.
It was therefore inevitable that he would be assigned to the newly-formed
Tank Corps,   After a few weeks of training, he was given the job of
driving one of the new French-built Renault FT-17's, a two-man light tank
carrying a small cannon.  Of course at this point in the war there were no
Americans with tank experience, so the Army decided that, for their first
battle, the new tankers should be accompanied by veteran French tank
soldiers.  My uncle was paired up with Lt. Jacques Aulantirn, who knew the
Renault inside and out, in addition to being a skilled tank commander and 
a clever tactician.  Unfortunately, Jacques spoke no English, and Uncle
Zack knew no French.

Still, they learned to communicate after a fashion, and soon gained a
reputation as the best tank crew in the unit.  It sort of happened by
accident; Uncle Zack's short left foot kept slipping off the left clutch 
when the tank would hit a bump, so the tank would swerve to the right.  His
tank would thus zig-zag across rough ground; the rest of the unit though 
this was a carefully-practiced evasive maneuver!  

Finally, the day came when Uncle Zack's unit was sent forward to help
press the attack on Soissons. Just before noon my uncle's unit rolled 
forward into the attack.  At first, progress was good, but soon the German
artillery began to take a toll on Uncle Zack's battalion; by two o'clock only
a third of the tanks were still advancing.  It was at that point that fate
stepped in.  

The French decided to support the attack with gas shells, hoping to catch
the Germans unprepared.  An inopportune change in the wind brought that gas
back toward the Allied lines, and the tanks drove straight into it.
Jacques saw the cloud and knew what it meant; he immediately shouted
"Gasse!" to Uncle Zack and began frantically donning his gas mask.

Battle is chaos, and for inexperienced soldiers, it's an exercise in
confusion.  Who can blame Uncle Zack, then, for assuming that Jacques meant
for him to "hit the gas"?  With the accelerator set wide open, Uncle Zack
careened headlong (with an occasional jolt to the right) into that fog of
death.

The first whiff of gas told my uncle he'd made a mistake, but he thought
quickly.  He knew he'd never be able to put on his gas mask in time; he had
only a few seconds to act.  Instead, he pulled out his Dr. Grabow, which
he'd already packed with tobacco in anticipation of a victory smoke after
the battle.  Clamping it fiercely between his teeth, he breathed in through
the pipe!  And as luck would have it, the combination of the heavy chemical
content of the Anniversary blend and the filter in the pipe stem
counteracted the deadly gas. Uncle Zack made it through, shaken but
alive, with the pipe jutting proudly from his mouth!

Needless to say, he kept that Dr. Grabow handy for the rest of the war;
indeed, it was his constant companion until his untimely death in a freak
sewing machine accident.  They buried that pipe with him.  They had to, 
really, because it was stitched to his hand.

I dunno... I have this image of pipe smoking linked to telling stories; a
bunch of guys sitting around a fireplace, smoking pipes and drinking
&lt;beverage of choice&gt;, reminiscing about bygone days and swapping tall
tales.  The digest gets kind of dry when we just talk about smoking, and
this is my way of livening it up a bit.  (I keep hoping that it'll catch on
with other people...)


I realize these stories get a bit long sometimes, and maybe I'm the only
person who thinks they're amusing.  If I get out of control, just let me

Your readers may be interested to know that Iwan Ries in Chicago
incorporates a pipe museum in its store. Some beautiful examples of 18th
Century hand-carved meerchaums among others there.
 
I'm a writer/editor by profession and definitely enjoy Bill Thacker's

Hello Steve,

I am quiet interested in having the back issues. I joining at number
81, so if it is possible I would like to have all earlier messages (or
is that a problem).

Furthermore, is it not possible to have a ftp server somewhere? Is it
not possible to join that ftp server with for instance the
sierra.stanfort.edu (used by HBD-digest)?

Thanks for sending the back issues.

All the best en keep up the good work!

Victor

[ No problem with the back issues, Victor! Actually, setting up an FTP
area would be slightly problematic, and I'm happy to mail out the back
issues as I get requests for them. -S. ]

       There is now an area in Files which contains more of the popular
Internet  pipe mail.  This area is called the Pipe file area.
       The next issue of the A&amp;M Gazette will go out some time in late
February or early March.  I have a pile of photographs from the Los Angles
pipe show which was held in October.  I will use as many of them as
possible.
       The michigan regional pipe smoking contest will be in mid-march.
As soon as the date is pinned down, I will post a note.  All pipe smokers
are welcome to participate.

       Steve, thanks for the disk.  As you can see  we are getting them
loaded into the bbs.
       One of the folks asked about pipe shops in michigan.  Of course,
Paul's Pipe shop is probably the largest and best in michigan, if not the
country.  I travel the country on business and trust me, not many compare.
The next shop, nearly as good, is Humidor 1 in Southfield, mi.  It is a
suburb of Detroit.  Good selection of tobacco, cigars, and in excess of
10,000 pipes in inventory.......of course Paul probably has twenty times
that number.  I just bought a pre-transition Peterson system pipe 307 from
Humidor 1, a great pipe.  He probably has a hundred peterson's alone.
       Anyway, thanks for the disk.
       Take care,

<a name="6">Subject: My Pipe Story</a>

Steve,

Not to let Bill's family take all the pipe heroics in this mail list,
I just wanted to offer my own special story to the pipe group.  Just
to underline the importance of keeping that pipe with you at all times.

Norm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You know guys,

Bill Thacker's story about his great-unclebeing saved by his trusty Dr.
Grabow pipe reminds me of our family story about my great great
Uncle Randolph of the Yukon.

Randolph was one of the first people to try and settle the Alaska
territory.  He would often roam around the wilderness for months
mapping out the region, just his dog sled and him.  It is a little
known fact that the well known sledding command 'MUSH' was attributed
to Randolph.  When driving the sled,  he was unable to smoke his pipe
(needing both hands free at all times for the job of driving).  He
still needed nicotine in his system though,  so he opted to chew
tobacco whenever working the sled.  One day as he left the trading post
he started his team after putting an unusually large plug of tobacco in
his mouth.  When he shouted to his dogs to 'MOVE IT' he mangled the
words so bad because of the plug,  it came out 'MOOOOSHT'.  The other
sled drivers saw with great wonder how Randolph's team pulled with such
force that they all soon began to use the same command.  After a
while,  'MUSH' was the common command to use for starting a sled team.

Anyway,  it was on one cold winter day that Randolf was in the extreme
North of the territory.  It had been so cold that he had not seen
another living thing (besides his sled dogs) for days.  He was running
low on rations and was heartbroken over the thought of having to skin
and eat one of his dogs.

He had hoped he could reach an outpost in two days time,  if they all
were at their peak,  but the dogs had run out of food two days before,
and they were moving rather slow.  Yet,  Randolph pressed on.  He would
not give up.  He had just completed mapping the Northern sector and
people were counting on him to deliver his map.

Mile after mile slipped by ever so slowly.  Randolph and his sled were
moving slower by the hour.  Just when they were 5 miles from the
outpost, Randolph noticed that one of his dogs was not pulling any
longer.  He stopped the sled and stepped forward to see what was wrong
with the dog.  The poor animal had froze solid right there on the run.
Randolph sat down in the snow next to the dog took out his pipe so that
he could ponder the situation.  Unfortunately this turned out to be a
hazardous error on Randolph's part because as he removed the plug of
chewing tobacco from his mouth,  another dog froze right there on the
spot.

Things were getting a little bleak right now.  Randolph could not get
very far,  being two dogs down,  and he needed to think out his
survival options.  He pulled his pouch from under his jacket and as he
started to load his pipe, plop,  another dog froze and fell on his
side.  

At this point,  Randolph noticed how really cold it was outside.

His pipe full of tobacco and dogs freezing all around him,  there was
only one thing for Randolph to do,  he struck a match.  He placed the
lit match to the tobacco in his pipe and started to draw air through
the pipe.  No smoke!  He looked a little more carefully, adjusted the
match,  and drew more air throught the pipe.  Still he could not get
the darn thing to light.  Randolph shook his hand in order to put out
the match so that he might be able to adjust the packing of his pipe,
but the match stayed lit!  Taking off the glove on his left hand,
Randolph waved his hand over the match, no heat!  He put his finger
into the flame and found that the fire had frozen solid.

Randolph could not remember a time when it had been this cold.

Taking off his glove was the second mistake Randolph had made that
day.  The insulation barrier being broken between his body and the
cold,   Randolph soon found himself unable to move,  he was being
frozen just like his dog team.

Randolph would probably have died right there and not been found until
the Spring had it not been for the fact that he had sat down to smoke
his pipe.  Lighting that match had saved his life.  It seems that the
outpost,  which was only five miles away,  noticed a light in the
distance every night.  After three days,  they decided to send a search
party out to find out what was the source of the light.  When the
search party got to the light,  they found Randolph, frozen, sitting in
the midst of his frozen dogs holding the lit match in his hand.  The
flame was still frozen and sending out that life saving beacon of light.

They piled Randolph and the dogs onto another sled, and quickly got
them back to the outpost.  Some ingenious soul thought to try putting
Randolph into a hot bath to thaw him out enough to fit into a pine
box.  After soaking for an hour in the bath,  Randolph let out a scream
and started cussing a blue streak.  Seems that when they put him in the
bath, they didn't take his pouch from him and had ruined 3 ounces of
Cavendish (besides,  Randolph wasn't due for a bath for a month).

Well,  the people of the outpost were able to save all but two of
Randolph's sled team and Randolph suffered no ill effects of the freeze
(except for the loss of his tobacco which the owner of the post
replaced since Randolph was often a very good customer,  and they HAD
given him a bath prematurely.)

As for the match,  they put it in a glass case and kept it outside in
the middle of the outpost and it served as a light for the rest of the
Winter,  until Spring,  when the flame unthawed,  the match burned out.
Randolph was right on hand at that moment.  Not wanting to waste a
match,  he lit his pipe.

		 Pipes Digest #96 - February 14, 1993

Well, happy Valentine's Day to all, and welcome to new members:


	J. Fulper (?)		(?.??????@?????.????.???)
	Charles Myers		(???????@???????.?????.???)

And, in honor of Valentine's Day, I'll post the following poem by
Rudyard Kipling. If nothing else, it shows that people have been
conflicted about tobak, and love, for a long time. (Yes, I know it's
sexist, but after all, Kipling was writing for a male audience nearly
110 years ago. For the [too-few] women reading this list, I might
suggest that you swap the gender of the terms, and poke fun at those
misguided males who don't appreciate a good cigar. Another alternative
would be to gender-neutralize the poem, e.g., "a Yuppie is only a
Yuppie..."  The thump-thump-thump you hear is Kipling spinning in his
grave :-) Enjoy!  -S.

			    THE BETROTHED
			  by Rudyard Kipling

	    'You must choose between me and your cigar' -
		*Breach of Promise Case, circa* 1885.


Open the old cigar-box, get me a Cuba stout,
For things are running crossways, and Maggie and I are out.

We quarrelled about Havanas - we fought o'er a good cheroot,
And *I* know she is exacting, and she says I am a brute.

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a space;
In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie's face.

Maggie is pretty to look at - Maggie's a loving lass,
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle, the truest of loves must pass.

There's peace in a Larranaga, there's calm in a Henry Clay;
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away -

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown -
But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!

Maggie, my wife at fifty - grey and dour and old -
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold!

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are,
And Love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar -

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in you pocket -
With never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider a while.
Here is a mild Manila - there is a wifely smile.

Which is the better portion - bondage bought with a ring,
Or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied with a string?

Counsellors cunning and silent - comforters true and tried,
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?

Thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,
Peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,

This will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,
With only a *Suttee's* passion - to do their duty and burn.

This will the fifty give me. When they are spent and dead,
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead.

The furrows of far-off Java, the isles of the Spanish Main,
When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again.

I will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,
So long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall.

I will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will I temper their hides,
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides.

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee Little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o'Teen.

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear,
But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year;

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight.

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove,
But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?

Open the old cigar-box - let me consider anew -
Old friends, and who is Maggie that I should abandon *you*?

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke;
And a woman is just a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.

Light me another Cuba - I hold to my first sworn vows.
If Maggie will have no rival, I'll have no Maggie for Spouse!

Hello Steve,

in digest#94 you wrote about the possibility to get back issues of the 
Pipes Digest. I have joined the mailgroup with number 92, and would
like to have the previous issues of the digest as well. 

Last week I have been in Istanbul, also known as the gate to orient. 
I wanted to take the opportunity and smoke a water pipe (Nargileh)
somewhere in a turkish coffeehouse. Believe it or not, we could not
find a location where to smoke a nargileh!! Even in the big oriental 
bazar nobody seems to know where we could smoke a water pipe in
Istanbul.
Therefore, I buyed a nargileh by myself, together with 500g tobacco
(called tombak or tombeky). Because I need some charcoal for smoking, 
I have to wait for the next barbecue party in summer, before I can 
test the nargileh.
Does anybody have some experience with water pipes ? 
 
Keep on smoking !

Cheerio Thomas.

[ Issues sent. Personally, I have no experience with water pipes that
involved tobacco :-) But have been interested for some time in the
concept. Any others? -S. ]

        I saw mention of your group in the Coterie collectors directory.
        I have been a pipe smoker for a number of years and I am
        considering doing some collecting.  I just purchased an older
        GBD bent bulldog in the original box.  How can I determine its
        age and value. I am chales Myers, the science Librarian at 
        Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster PA...home of 
        the oldest tobacco store in the US...Demuths Pipe Shop...sadly
        disappointing.

[ My suggestions would be to take it to a pipe show and see what you
can get for it; there are shows coming up in New York in March,
Washington DC in May. As far as I know, there is no established price
guide for pipes. Any other ideas? And thanks for joining us! -S. ]

Hi -
   First of all, I was wondering if I am still on the list, under my "username

The net config has changed here several times in the last two weeks, and I

Now for the serious stuff...
   I will be in Orlando for a couple of days later this month, and I was
wondering if anyone could recommend one or two "really neat" pipe shops to
visit - there aren't any listed in the resource guide I have.  Also, is it
still illegal to buy Cuban cigars in the US?  I thought I had heard that the
ban had been lifted.

<a name="2">Subject: marvelous these 'old' digets</a>

Hello Steve,

Thanks for sending the 'old' digets. It was good to read them (and
I will reread then sometime). Certainly the articles from Bill and
Norm about (the growing of) tabacco. It is really good to have such
'story' tellers in our mids (and I mean story teller in the righ
sense, Norm;-).
I hope indeed that people will continue that, perhaps if I get the
atmosphere of putting something on paper, I will certainly do that.

I am still wondering if it is posible to try to describe a smoke by
means of some pre-defined terms. I certainly am aware that it will
NEVER be possible to fully describe the atmosphere of enjoyment of
a smoke, but it is always good to be able to tell people what they
can expect. At this moment that is quiet difficult, and I think
that is because of lack of defined terms. If that is true, I would
like to start some discussion with you about this. I read some books
(concerning cigars, so perhaps it is different for pipes), and I
came acrose some tables of terms. I will compose that list and you
will see it. 
One thing I already know, is that is seems very difficult to
describe all the terms assosiated with bruns/smoke/fire. It seems
as if we are afraid of it;-)

All the best and keep up story telling!

Also, Brian Morgan asked last week about pipe shops near Orlando. Here
is the only Florida pipe shop listed in the two most recent issues of
the _Ephemeris_:

	Jim's Pipe and Tobacco Shop
	2812-C West 23rd St.
	Panama City, FL

Recommended, but I don't know if the geography is right for a trip
from Orlando. In any case, enjoy the trip, and

				Smoke in peace,

I must say, that with all the snow afalling, I feel the right and
proper Gentle-Hobbit, what with getting this most enjoyable
newsletter.  Reading is a delight, and watching the snow flakes lazily
drift, my thoughts turned to an interesting matter: What would be a
good choice for and outdoor, or porch fill while the snow falls?  With
the wood-burning scent of fireplaces, and the coolness of the flakes,
a nice churchwarden, some sweetrolls, a fine red, and some deer
grazing make perfect compliments like and unto themselves and each
other; yet what would be a good fill for such a day as one which
inspired Robert Frost?

THANKS FOR THE PROMPT RESPONSE. I WOULD APPRECIATE SUGGESTIONS FROM YOU OR THE
MEMBERS OF THE MAILGROUP HOW TO SELL THESE FINE PIPES. I HAVE NO WAY OF
ESTIMATING THEIR VALUE. FIRST I HAVE TO CREATE AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION. ASIDE
FROM DUNHILL, THERE ARE ONLY TWO PIPE SHOPS LEFT IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND THEY DO
NOT HANDLE CONSIGNMENTS. WHAT REFERENCE WORK SHOULD I CONSULT IN ORDER TO
DESCRIBE THE PIPES? THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE.

<a name="4">Subject: Interesting thought...</a>

In the past few years (decades), more and more concern has been given to the
dangerous effects of pesticides in our food.  I was wondering if anyone has
given thought or perhaps grown their own pipe tobacco amongst the members.
I understand that tobacco is a relatively difficult and specialized crop to
grow, and was interested in hearing if any of you have tried it in your
personal gardens at home.  If so, how did your effort turn out?  And, how
did you feel the overall quality was?

<a name="5">Subject: Pipes</a>

    Thanks for signing me up so quickly. I'm new to the net, so
please let me know if I'm addressing my messages wrong, or if I'm
violating network etiquette.

    I'm 40 years old and a father of three boys. I am a supervisor
at a local (El Paso, Tx) oil refinery, and before that I was a
Sgt. with the local Police Department. My wife and I joined the
Police Department at the same time, and she is still with them
(going on 18 years).

    I only recently took up pipe smoking, at my doctors
suggestion. I was a 3 pack a day cigarette smoker before that.
Needless to say, I am glad I switched. I also enjoy a cigar from
time to time.

    I'm starting to collect pipes, and am currently up to 25
medium grade pipes. I have one Dunhill, but on the average I
purchase something in the 50 to 100 dollar range. So far I seem to
prefer Stanwells, Charatens, and Nordings.

    The estate pipe market is something that I would like to get
into, but I currently have no contacts. We only have one pipe store
in town, and they don't have a very interesting collection.

    Whenever I travel, the first place I visit is the local
tobbaconists. My favorites so far have been Stag Tobaconists and
Ford&Haig Tobacconists in Phoenix, and R.J. Clarke in Vancouver,
B.C.

    I will be going to Birmingham and Montgomery Alabama, and
Atlanta Georgia next month, and would appreciate any advise on
where I could find a good tobacconist there.

    I am also interested in buying any issues of Pipe Lovers
Magazine. I've never seen one, and would like to read any old
issues. It seems that not much is written anymore about pipe
smoking and collecting.

                                    Jon
                                     
[ Hope some of our members can help you with Birmingham and Atlanta,
Jon! And welcome to the group. -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Smokin' Homegrown</a>

Gary asked about raising tobacco at home:

&gt; I understand that tobacco is a relatively difficult and specialized crop to
&gt; grow, and was interested in hearing if any of you have tried it in your
&gt; personal gardens at home. 

(Gee, I *told* you he asked about growing tobacco at home... you should've
taken my word for it! 8-)

Given that a person lived in the proper climactic zone, it's possible.
Gary, for example, is from "msu".  If that's Missouri State, no problem.
If it's Minnesota State, I think he can give up now.

You could grow tobacco at home without pesticides (you'd want to to
fertilize, but those are Good Chemicals, not Bad Chemicals).  Tobacco is
very sensitive to the soil it's grown in, though; if you want Virginia
leaf, you've got to grow it in Virginia.  (That's why Cuban cigars still
have that mystique.  Cuban Seed Leaf tobacco can be (and is) grown in
Honduras, but it doesn't taste the same.)

As for how to actually grow tobacco... well, I wrote a long, dull article
on exactly that a year or more ago on this very digest.  (Is this puppy
archived?)  I didn't keep a copy myself, as I already knew how to do it.

Assuming that you raised the tobacco, cured it, and stripped it, you'd next
need to clean it and (unless you just want plain "tobacco" flavor) season
it.  Couldn't tell you how to do either.  Then you've got to cut it, which
probably isn't a big deal.

In the final analysis, I would suggest that the chemicals used in growing 
the tobacco are probably less of a concern than those naturally in the
tobacco (e.g., tars) and those used to flavor certain tobaccos (e.g., rum)
(which is not to say that burning rum is a health hazard.) (Well, not the
fumes, anyway.)

Oh, and BTW; tobacco farming is a regulated industry.  Each farmer receives
a "base," a limit to how many acres they can grow.  I called the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (geez, what a fun place that must be to
work!  Somebody let me know when they get responsibility for Fast Cars and
Pizza, OK?) and the agent there assured me that it is legal to grow tobacco
for your own consumption; selling it, on the other hand, would be illegal.

   Hi Steve, I have enjoyed the last few issues of The Digest very much!
Please e-mail to me the back issues (before #95 I think).
   As for tobacconist in the Atlanta area I can recommend the following:
         Royal Cigar Co. - 1776 Peachtree St. NE - (404) 876-9422

         Edward's Pipe and Tobacco - 444 N. Indian Creek Dr.
-(404)292-1721.
   The former was an Atlanta landmark before the store was moved out of
downtown proper. Edward's is also a good place to get a smoke.

<a name="5">Subject: New Member and a few questions</a>

        Hi all.  I am one of those on and off smokers.  I have smoked pipes
from time to time.  I joined the group and within a few minutes of joining
called several of the sources for pipe items.  

        I have a few questions for anyone out there.  I am a Civil War
reenactor, I haven't been to my first real event yet, but I am learning as
much as I can so that I can portray an authentic 'impression' as a Civil
War soldier in the 1990's.  
        A reenactor friend of mine who I owe the world to for introducing
me to the authentic side of the hobby and who has provided valuable
guidance is a pipe smoker.  I gained some interest and he gave me a quick
reference as to how pipes were made.  I did a little more research and
found out some more details on handmade pipes (quick pipes made by soldiers
when they could not buy one) of soldiers.

        I have a box of wood coming so I can experiement with making these
homemade pipes.  My question to pose is this:  are any of you out there
carvers or makers of pipes?  If so, how can I find out more on pipes of the
19th century?  I am more interested in the common wood pipe and not clay
pipes.  I have seen many fancy pictures of carved pipes used by officers
that were cherry and very fancy.  Overall, my goal is to learn as much as I
can about making pipes.  I have never made a pipe, but have smoked many. 
Can anyone point me in the correct direction? (resources)

Thanks

Ted

[ Norm carves some, but as far as I know nobody is a specialist in
19th century reproductions. I could recommend "A Complete Guide to
Collecting Antique Pipes" by Ben Rappaport (ISBN 0-916838-22-6) as a
source of ideas for you. Also see Pimo's in the Resource Guide. -S. ]

Thanks!  My roommate, who is a young-ish looking 25 years old, is part 
of a small but determined group trying to start a club/newsletter for 
pipe smokers under the age of roughly 30-35.  So far they've produced 
two issues but (in our case) time is at such a premium lately  the 
production schedule has slipped a great deal!

Anyway, thanks again for the back issues!  Good luck with the studies .

anything you could study that couldn't be made easier with a pipe!

Howdy all,

I have enjoyed reading the pipe digest and now wish to contribute.  
Unfortunately my contribution is not that of a whimsical antidote,
or receipe for growing tobacco, but a question.

I have only started to 'dabble' in the wonderful world of pipes and
their 'toys'.  My father gave me a pipe a few months ago.  I would
like to know if it is a decent brand of pipe or just a regular everyday
pipe that he figured would be fine to get me going.  I don't see my
father all that often lately and I don't want to just come out and
ask him about the pipe.  Well.. onto the specifics.  The pipe has
the words "Buts-Choquin VERSAILLES" (well thats what I could make of it)
pressed into the wood grain stem.  And on the mouth piece the letters
"BC" are etched.

I am very anxious to read your responses.

Roll Tide,

Monica should contact the Museum of the American Indian in NYC (a branch of
the Smithsonian) or the Smithsonian itself in DC.
 
On another topic, have any of your cigar smoking members heard of J R
Tobacco in North Carolina? Can save a bundle on cigars. For a catalog, call
1-800-J-R-CIGAR. Interesting place to visit (right on I95) with bargains in
remaindered books by the hundreds of titles, huge cigar inventory (obscure
ones tend to be a bit dried out), cut rate brand name cosmetics, some pipes
and lots of the commercial packaged pipe tobaccos. I buy my cigars from
there and my tobacco (Riverboat, a Danish blend cavendish-cut burley; mild
aromatic, women seem to love having me around with it &lt;g&gt;) and pipes from
the Tabagerie, Westport CT on US 1 between I95 exits 17-18 (closer to 18,
head south on US 1 from the exit, in shops across from Ed Mitchell's
clothing). If you stop in, tell Tony I sent you and be sure to check out his
estate pipes.

Hello everyone,

Since this mailing list is fairly American I would like to know if
there are many European pipe tobaccos sold in the US. For instance
tobaccos like MacBaren(Dani sh), Dunhill(British) or tobaccos in the
Amphora collection(Dutch). I wonder if the Dutch tobaccos are known at
all outside Europe. Question number two: if you know any Dutch
tobaccos, do you enjoy them? Or Danish (like Alsbo Gold).

Enjoy your pipes,

Niek.

[ Dunhill, MacBaren, and Amphora tobaccos are all widely sold, and
enjoyed, in the US. Don't know about other Dutch tobak. And thanks for
the word - we will enjoy our pipes! -S. ]

Oh, the former USSR has a rich history when it comes to pipe smoking!  I'm
glad for the opportunity to expound a bit!

Of course, the pipe was invented in Russia, in 1554.  They didn't become
popular, however, for over 100 years (when tobacco began to arrive from the
British colonies of North America).

For decades, only the wealthy could afford to smoke the imported Virginia
leaf, but in 1768 farmers in southern Russia began to successfully
cultivate the plant.  It soon became widely grown through the regions we
know as Azerbaijan, Soviet Georgia, and Soviet Tennessee.  Pipe smoking
became a national hobby, and it was considered nekulturny to have tea
without a smoke.

This affluence attracted the interest of Russia's neighbors.  In 1812, a
jealous Napoleon sent his armies into Russia to plunder tobacco stores.  At
the Tsar's orders, a "scorched earth" policy was implemented; the Russians
would send their tobacco up in smoke rather than allow it to be taken by
the French!  Sadly, the furnace-like tobacco fires spread, destroying
millions of acres of farmland and villages.  (It is said that the odor of
gunpowder and Perique are still noticeable at the Borodino memorial.)

The Pyrrhic victory sent the Russian smoking industry into a virtual dark
age.  Domestic production had all but ceased with the loss of the 1812
crop, and the high cost of imported tobacco led to unrest among the
peasants.  The situation was kept in check only by the harshest repressive
measures, until finally, in 1917, the dam burst.

The new Communist government quickly implented a five-year plan which
called for huge increases in tobacco production and established "Peoples 
Pipe Works" at key points around the nation.  The most important were 
located at Bryaransk (sometimes nicknamed "Pipograd") and Merzhomsk. 
Typical of a planned economy, only a limited selection of rather 
unimaginative designs were available.  For example, in 1937 the Red October
Pipe Works in Bryaransk introduced the "V.I.Lenin,Hero of the Soviet People
Commemorative Pipe No.17."  The "Sporty 17", as it was known, weighed over
14 ounces empty, and held over an ounce of tobacco.  Constructed of oak, it
was rough-hewn and unfinished, and could not be disassembled for cleaning.
It was, however, remarkably durable, and could be filled with charcoal for
outdoor cooking.  

During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviets attempted to convert pipe
production to less strategically-valuable materials.  Experiments with
alternatives, including steel, cement, and unseasoned pine led to repeated
failures (and no few fatalities).  Pipes from this era are extremely
valuable; should you come into possession of one, do not smoke it, leave it
in its factory cosmoline coating!

In 1943, however, the Kalabashnikov Design Bureau in Leningrad succeeded in
creating a new pipe, which could be rapidly fired and was auto-loading.  
The pipe could be produced in almost any machine shop using mild steel 
stampings and leftover sawdust.  It was a major factor in preserving morale
during the seige of that heroic city, and its production soon spread across
the USSR. By the end of the war, over 70 million "Aromat Kalabashnikova
M.1943", or AK-43's, had been produced.  

Pipes played a vital role in the defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler, you may be
aware, was a vehement anti-smoker, having vowed to annex the USSR for 
"breathensraum."   The turning point of the war, the German defeat at 
Stalingrad, can be traced to Hitler's order that his troops hold their 
ground to allow time for the destruction of the vital meerschaum mines 
there.  

After the war, the Soviet tobacco industry continued to grow.  By the 
1950's, the USSR was ready for a tobacco war with the United States,
embargoing the import of our crops.  The USA responded, naturally enough,
with a blockade of Cuban cigars, which to this day cannot be imported.    
The "Cold War" (so called because of the many empty pipe bowls which
resulted) continued for decades, until the SALT (Strategic Aromatics and
Latakia Treaty) accords became the first step toward international
friendship.


As you can see, pipes are an integral part of Russian history.  They should
be treated reverently, like a religous icon or a bottle of vodka.  And
remember the old Byelorussian proverb: "No man is a stranger who has once
smoked your pipe or painted your ox-cart."

Well, it loses something in translation.

           A pipe gives a thinking man time to think and 
              a fool something to stick in his mouth.

[ And don't forget that Joseph Stalin, famous world-class heavyweight
despotic tyrant and trendsetter in '70s mustache styles, was also a
pipe devotee!  And so was Alger Hiss, famous State Department spy, so
named for his trademark heavy buildup of goo and subsequent
sussurating noises!  AND Robert Oppenheimer, atom-bomb genius deposed
by HUAC (the House Un-Aromatic Censors, led by the infamous
Representative Joe "the only GOOD Comoy is a DEAD Comoy" McCarthy!)
And Nixon was a pipe smoker, too - I bet he was in on it, somewhere!
Coincidence...  or conspiracy?

On second thought, _do_ forget Stalin... -S. ]

<a name="3">Subject: Lifestyle changes and Sherlockiana</a>

Well, your moderator finally did it.

That's the reason this Digest is so late.

On Friday, April 16, between the hours of 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM, Yours
Truly was subjected to intense scrutiny by a select panel of five
inquisitioners. The object was to justify whether the last four years
of his life had resulted in anything meaningful.

Well, I dunno, still. But the practical results were that I get to
tack three letters and two punctuation marks after my last name, and
have become a Luxury Property in the employment market.

In other words, I defended my thesis. I graduated. I GOT OUT! YAY!!!!

And It's "Doctor Masticola" now. For purposes of our discussion here,
I look upon it as following in the steps of Dr. Grabow.

To celebrate, I went out and bought myself a "Baskerville" from
Peterson's "Sherlock Holmes" series. (Found it at John David;
bargained the owner down to $130.) Still haven't smoked it yet;
that'll wait until I have my own place, which will definitely be an
antismoker-free environment. :-)

Thanks to all on the Pipes Mailgroup for your support, encouragement,
and friendship. My status as moderator won't change, at least not
immediately, but my mailing address may have to move at some point.
I'll keep you posted.

For now, join me in lighting a professorial pipe, and until next time,

					Smoke in peace,

					~\U Steve.

(trying to generate remembrances of things past for my new wife), and the
Perkins Tobacco Co. is still around southwest of Boston, but I don't have
their number handy.  He used to smoke a numbered blend, but now my wife
found a familiar red and green box called "Half and Half" at a drug store.
Too bland for me.

       -------

   I'd highly recommend against brewing "teabacco".  Although tobacco juice
is a fine emetic, if you ever kept it down you might be in trouble.  I've
heard that the amount of nicotine in one pack of cigarettes is the well over
the fatal does for ingestion.  I don't know how much nicotine is exhaled
(ie remains in the "second-hand smoke"), but being a small alkaloid once it
gets in the gut it's all going to go into the bloodstream.
   There've been quite a few reports of people who continued smoking while
using a nicotine patch, and having heart attacks.  If we presume they didn't
start smoking more, and that the patch is somewhat decreased, that means
they only had twice their normal amount of nicotine.
 
   As for pesticides, I don't have any hard information, but most alkaloids
(nicotine, caffeine, cocaine) are natural insecticides produced by the plant.
I imagine that except for the colorfully-described tobacco worm, tobacco
doesn't have many insect enemies, and may not need much external pesticide.
Viruses and fungi may be another matter.  (I could go off-topic and ask
what it is that makes pest-resistant tomatoes [for organic farming] so
pest-resistant, and whether you'd prefer to have tested artificial chemicals
on the outside, or natural poisons throughout the fruit.)o

Steve,
 The last copy of the Pipe Digest I got was #104 June 18, 1993. I hope
there isn't a problem. It is my understanding that the largest letter
that can be sent to CIS is 30K. Will this be a problem?  Also, I am
looking for a book by the name of "My Lady Nicotine" by J.M.  Barrie.
Maybe some of the reader's can help.

To try and generate some net noise...
I found some cigars made with pipe tobacco the other day, and gave them a try.
They were pretty bad, but I liked the idea and convenience.  They would be
handy when working outside or in the garage, etc.  Anyway, I wondered if
anybody else has tried any that were decent.  I normally smoke a cavendish
in my pipes, and would like to find something fairly aromatic like that.
  Any suggestions????

I checked at the local smokeshop yesterday, and the Autumn 1993 issue
is out. I believe this is the latest. (If you have the premier issue,
you're pretty lucky!) 

BTW, I bought back copies and enjoyed reading 'em last night. Although
I'm not a frequent cigar smoker, this put me in a frame of mind to go
out and experiment with a quality cigar. Will do so, Real Soon Now...

The summer issue of C.A. has a picture of Bill Clinton, hunkered down
and chewing furtively on an unlit panatella in the officially
smoke-deprived White House. It was priceless! If anyone can scan it
in, especially in color, please do so and I'll post the GIF.
_Especially_ if you can superimpose the quote below.

Also, BTW, there has been some "discussion" (often flame) on
rec.food.drink about a cigar or tobacco newsgroup. I feel it's a great
idea, but it should be moderated to avoid getting bashed. Colin
(sorry, I don't have your last name!), our newest member above, is
organizing the effort, and has 25 people interested. Whether the group
is eventually created or not, all are invited to join the Pipes
mailgroup, of course!

So, until next time, here's wishing you tall cold 'un out on the
porch, a comfortable lawn chair, a quality cigar or pipe, and a

		 Pipes Digest #107 - August 24, 1993

Welcome to new members:

	Andrew Tepper		(at15+@andrew.cmu.edu)
	Colin Crist		(???@??????.??.??.??)
	Gregory Nyce		(?????@???.??????)

And we have a LOT of discussion this week, concerning proposals for a
pipes newsgroup! Background: Andy and Colin proposed a cigars
newsgroup in rec.food.drink. I saw the advancing flames and contacted
them. Turned out Colin was putting together an effort to create the
newsgroup, so I got involved. And there the fun starts...

In short, the resolution seems to be that we will propose two new
newsgroups, tentatively named rec.fine-tobacco and
talk.politics.smoking.  

The discussions that led to these decisions are below. Feel free to
join in, here or in news.groups when we make the proposal. (For your
enjoyment, there are also some bits about cigars, interspersed. :-)

This is the most fun I've had here in a while! -S.

<a name="3">Subject: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking</a>

All,

All in all, I've recieved about 25 replies from people regarding a
smoking newsgroup.  As well as support, a few points have been raised
that should be considered before we go ahead and start a CFV.

1. Steve Masticola (????????@????.???????.???) recommended that the group be
   moderated. The reason for this is that smoking has become a subject that
   can cause heated discussion and non-smokers starting a thread such as
   "You are all going to die !" or other such rubbish. Whislt I agree with 
   this, having a moderated group would require someone to moderate it and
   would loose out on a newsgroups spontaneous and dynamic nature.

2. What shall we call it ? rec.tobacco or rec.smoking ?

3. Are 25 replies really enough ? At a call for votes, I could well imagine
   some bloody-minded people out there voting against just because we are
   smoker.

4. There is already a mailgroup (contact Steve as above if you want to
   join the list, I have.

So, how do you all feel ? Shall we go for a CFV or not ? My opinions
one this are that I would happily arrange the vote, a few more of you
can second it (Andy, Steve ?) and see what happens. I wouldn't be as
keen on a moderated group, we'd have to see how it went and the number
of flames that occured and maybe moderate at a later date.

If the preference for a moderated group occured then I wouldn't be
able to do much moderation myself as I'm a contractor and move from
place and cannot guarantee email :-( etc.

Anyway, you thoughts please ! I'll summarise in a day or so and act on
your decisions.

Cheers,
	Colin.

<a name="4">Subject: Re:  Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking</a>

Hi, Colin,

Could you please mail this out to your followers?

First, thanks for the advert for the pipes mailgroup! Anyone who would
like to join can mail me at ????????@???.???????.???. Also thanks for
your organizational efforts.

Second, I'll second your motion to begin forming the newsgroup, but
with an additional suggestion.

If a group on the alt. hierarchy (alt.tobacco or something similar) is
acceptable, then there would be no need for calls for votes, which I
feel would almost certainly be defeated. A friend of mine, Elias
Mazur, made a similar call years ago, and was roundly booed off the
net for it. (That was the genesis of the pipes mailgroup, BTW - I
heard about Elias third-hand, contacted him, and posted a call for
members.)

The standard procedure would be to post to alt.config a call for
discussion, wait a few days for the flames to die down, then post a
create message. (I've done the last and can probably still find my
notes on how to do this.)

In any case, I'll mail anything I receive on the subject to the pipes
mailgroup, probably by Friday.

Also, if anyone's interested, there is a BBS in Michigan called the
"Briar Patch," that has a "With Pipe and Book" discussion group.
Interested parties can phone it at (313) 340-0814. Tell Neil I sent
you :-)

Looking forward to having a legitimate mailgroup!

Smoke in peace,
~\U Steve.

&gt; I'd strong recommend rec.tobacco rather than rec.smoking, even though
&gt;it's less accurate (we don't seem to be inviting chewers, nor OTOH users
&gt;of hashish) because of all the negative connotations of "smoking".

Fine; alternately :) "alt.tobacco" or "alt.tobak". See my previous
mailing.

&gt;There
&gt;might be some call for talk/soc.politics.smoking for smokers' rights and
&gt;all that, but I'd hope that this new group would be simply to share and
&gt;enhance the enjoyment of smoking tobacco (in pipe, cigar, or cigarette
&gt;form) and any legal, political, or health concerns be limited to increasing
&gt;that enjoyment, if they appear at all.

I kind of halfway agree about that... wouldn't want to restrict
discussions of politics from the group. I'm more interested in
preventing smoker-bashing.
 
&gt; A very regular message explaining that the newsgroup is not for discussion
&gt;of the rights of smokers and non-smokers, nor is it for discussion of the
&gt;risks about which we're well aware, might make the newsgoup more enjoyable,
&gt;once it's started.

Realistically, I don't think that's going to take the place of
moderating the newsgroup. There are always going to be a certain
percentage of people who either (a) want to save you from your evil
habits, or (b) want to damn you to eternal hellfire for them. (Usually
both.) These people aren't going to care about polite guideline
postings.

Regarding Colin's comments on spontaneity, I think that moderated
groups can certainly be spontaneous -- software exists for automatic
authorization control, so all the moderator would have to do is check
for flame, and hit the appropriate keys.

I think that creating an unmoderated tobacco group is an invitation to
a permanent flamefest. It's the reason why rec.guns, for instance, is
moderated.

&gt; As an alternative, would Steve or someone else from the Pipes mailing list
&gt;be willing to widen its charter, or form a new mailing list, to include all
&gt;users of smoked tobacco (or maybe chewers too.)  I've seen lately at least
&gt;a tolerance for discussion of cigars.

Already in the mailgroup's charter. I certainly tolerate, and
encourage, discussions of cigars, cigarettes, chewing, snuff-dipping,
smokers' rights, whatever you care to do with the leaf. The only thing
I categorically reject is antismoking flames. Assuming the newsgroup
isn't created, anyone who wants to talk cigars on the mailgroup should
feel free.

&gt;     - David Chesler (??????@?????.???), writing from Cambridge, Mass,
&gt;           where anything goes, as long as you don't smoke while doing it.

Tobacco, that is... on my one visit to Hahvahd Squayah, I smelled less
licit leaves being burned, quite freely. :)

<a name="6">Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking</a>


I don't like the idea of a moderated group; moderated groups seem very
"anti-Internet". I also would prefer rec.tobacco to alt.tobacco only
since (as I understand it) some sites have eliminated the whole alt.
hierarchy.

We may have to put up with the occasional flame, but it will certainly
be nothing compared to what happened when I first _mentioned_ cigars in
rec.food.drink! 

I say we go ahead with the RFD/CFV procedure to create rec.tobacco. (I
agree that this is better than using the word smoking.) If the CFV does
not pass due too many "no" votes we can go ahead with alt.tobacco.

Andy

P.S. I feel I must add something worthwhile to this message... Cigar
smokers: I had an Arturo Fuente (Churchill size, the one with the cedar
inner wrapper) on Saturday. What a fantastic cigar! Nice rich flavor the
whole way through, and without being harsh. I'd like to know if that
company makes any superpremium cigars; this was only in the $2.25 range.
(I do think there's some price/taste correlation within a given brand.
For instance: try the regular Partagas vs. their "Limited Reserve")

Oh, well. Looks like I've started a "discussion" :-)

Andy Tepper writes:

&gt;"anti-Internet".

I'm not sure what you mean by "anti-Internet", so I'll assume that you
mean "anti-freedom." Specifically, anti- freedom of speech. But
arguing that moderating the newsgroup violates freedom of speech is
like arguing that the existence of a bar violates your freedom to be a
teetotaler, or that the existence of the Usenet violates your freedom
to read newspapers.  

A moderated newsgroup is simply a specialized communications medium.
It does not violate anyone's freedom of speech.  Anyone who feels that
they've been unfairly constrained by moderation is free to post in any
of the 2000 existing groups, or to try to create their own.

But there are also practical considerations, as well as philosophical
ones, why rec.tobacco should be moderated. I have already stated one,
and will re-state it here. If the group is created unmoderated, it
_will_ be a magnet for bashing of smokers. Or at the very least, for
smoker versus nonsmoker arguments that lead nowhere and detract from
the enjoyment of the group. Furthermore, if this happens, it will be
impossible to start moderating the group without elaborate rigamarole,
including probably another call for votes. Which we could easily lose.

An unmoderated group would give the antis yet another vehicle for
flamage and bashing. Instead, let's give ourselves an outlet to enjoy
discussing the pleasures of moderate tobacco use, unmolested. Let's
propose a moderated group.

&gt;We may have to put up with the occasional flame, but it will certainly
&gt;be nothing compared to what happened when I first _mentioned_ cigars in
&gt;rec.food.drink! 

IMHO, your experience with rec.food.drink would only be the beginning.
Look around. Antismoking flame wars are everywhere. I can name three
groups, right of the top of my head, not including rec.food.drink,
where they're going on now. A group devoted to tobacco _will_ be a
flame magnet. Conservatively, I'd estimate the signal-to-flame ratio
would probably be about 1:4, on a good day. 

The history of Elias Mazur's rec.pipes proposal bears me out. There
are just too many people on the net who are eager to bash smokers.

&gt;I also would prefer rec.tobacco to alt.tobacco only
&gt;since (as I understand it) some sites have eliminated the whole alt.
&gt;hierarchy.

Good point.

&gt;I say we go ahead with the RFD/CFV procedure to create rec.tobacco. (I
&gt;agree that this is better than using the word smoking.) If the CFV does
&gt;not pass due too many "no" votes we can go ahead with alt.tobacco.

I would be glad to support a proposal for a moderated group, in either
the rec or alt hierarchy. I cannot support an unmoderated one.

Thanks to all who have contributed to a very interesting discussion.

I'd like to say I support a _moderated_ group _if_ someone is willing to
take this on.

Moderated or not, I favor a rec group if feasible to an alt group for
reasons already raised.  Alt distribution is terrible.  In sampling
various news servers, I've found my home server is receiving only about
one in four of the posts which I can find on other servers.  This is a
true distribution problem, not a time delay.

Re: Flames.  How about rec.cigar or alt.cigar?  Those actually interested
in fine tobacco would poke in to see what's happening.  Hopefully, the
flamers might be less inclined to do so than with a .tobacco or .smoking. 
In offering this I am not saying the scope of discussion should be
constrained.  But possibly there might be fewer flames and negatives
in a call for votes.

Well, in between the gulped coffee (and half a bowl in my Peterson

the Arturo Fuente reviews in Cigar Aficionado.  They use a
blind-tasting system and rate on a scale of 1 to 100. Here are the
early results. (All the Arturo Fuente cigars use Dominican filler and
binder and a Cameroon wrapper, so I won't repeat that info.)

Coronas: (Spring '93):
----------------------

Arturo Fuente Reserva No. 3
	
Length:		5 1/2 inches
Ring guage: 	44
Price:		$4.25
Rating: 	88/100

"Already a cigar well-appreciated in Europe, it's only now being
smoked in America. This is a harmonious smoke with cedar and tobacco
flavors which go on and on in the aftertaste."


Torpedos: (Summer '93)
----------------------

Arturo Fuente Hemingway Classic

Length:		7 inches
Ring guage: 	48
Price:		$4.00

Arturo Fuente Hemingway Masterpiece

Length:		9 1/4 inches
Ring guage: 	52

----------------------

Arturo Fuente Double Chateau
	
Length:		6 3/4 inches
Ring guage: 	50
Price:		$2.25

Arturo Fuente Churchill
	
Length:		7 1/4 inches
Ring guage: 	48
Price:		$1.85
Rating: 	86/100

<a name="10">Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking</a>

 I vote against {rec|alt}.cigar, in favor of {rec|alt}.toba{k|cco}:
 
 1) All users of tobacco should be welcomed.
 2) Similarity (especially given that names are often shortened) between
       the words cigar and cigarette would attract the flamers.
 3) Some folks think all cigars smell like bad cheap cigars.
 4) The n pack per day Merit/Marlboro/Camel smokers don't often think of
    the plant from which their product is produced, and neither do the
    anti-smokers, so tobacco doesn't have as much negative connotation
    as cigarette or smoking.
 5) I don't usually smoke cigars :-)  (Although I probably should.  Judging
    from the 2 minutes I got to smoke the Jamaican of which a friend brought
    a case to my wedding, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had there.)

 Moderated is good if someone will volunteer.  If the group doesn't attract
flamers, the moderator can auto-reflect, or just auto-reflect with selective
twitting.  (I gather from what Steve said that there is software to do this.)
Moderated doesn't have to mean digest form.
 
 Rec is better than alt, if we can get it.  Alt is better than nothing.
(And nothing is better than a good smoke... :-) ).

Regarding the *.toba* newsgroup: If the decision is made to create a

Andy? It's your baby, after all :-)

I'd do it, but I'm waaaaaaaaaaaay overcommitted as is; besides which,
I'm already doing the pipes mailgroup.

If no one in this small cohort wants to do it, I could put a call for
volunteers out on the pipes mailgroup, but I really hope that doesn't
come to pass.

BTW: I vote for:

	- rec.fine.tobacco initially, alt.fine.tobacco as a backup.
	  The word "fine" to indicate the purpose of the group.

	- Moderated, but not digested, as David suggests.

BTW, David, I'm including your previous message for Andy's benefit; he

Steve,

    If there's a consensus that rec.fine.tobacco should be moderated,
I'll do the moderating. I know nothing about moderating a group, so
there may be a few problems:

  There are occasions when I am not on the internet for 4-7 days at a
stretch; I assume that for those periods, things can be set up so the
group is unmoderated for a short time (although nobody will have to know
it). Little flames may creep up in those periods, but they could quickly
be extinguished.
  Also, I don't have much space in my account, and I don't want to push
for more since I am officially CMU "staff" who currently works zero
hours per month. This is how I get my account, and it's best not to stir
this delicate arrangement. I am assuming messages don't sit in my
account until they are posted. (I could handle some storage, just not
lots.)

  Assuming that these are not problems, let's do an RFD for rec.fine.tobacco!

<a name="13">Subject: Re: Status of rec.tobacco/rec/smoking</a>

 &gt;    ... In offering .cigar as a suggestion, my thinking was that the
 &gt; readership in news.announce might be more willing to let us slip by and be
 &gt; created if they thought we were discussing the merits of one cigar versus
 &gt; another, rather than promoting use.  I realize this is a _tenuous_
 &gt; argument about emotions of people I don't know.  It's a hunch. (shrug)

Paul:

 Agreed, generally.  _MY_ thinking was that a random pipe-smoking browser
who doesn't yet like cigars wouldn't bother visiting rec.cigars.  In my
humble guess, we'd lose more people like that than we would lose anti-
smoking flamers.

 And once we're in our own space, I don't think we'll attract the rabid
anti-smokers.  Even alt.sex.bondage and other perverted sexual groups
don't get all that many problem people.  I can't speak for rec.guns, but
the firearms mailing lists get occassional reasoned argument, which as long
as it remains polite is welcomed.  Abortion is a hot topic of course, but
it's not all that bad.  (I'm the keeper of the abortion bit bucket for the
libertarian mailing list: whenever the topic comes up people tell the offender
to talk to me, and I say "Here is the list of people interested in talking
about abortion in a libertarian framework, start a mailing list" and that
shuts them up, and I add their name to the list for next time.)

 In a net that has places for perverts, bikers, druggies, gun nuts, and
political and abortion whackos of all creeds, I don't anticipate much
problem once the group is established.

 I agree with Steve that it's easier to start moderated than the other way
around, but I'm not as worried as he seems to be, now that I've thought about
it, that we'll get rabid anti-smokers.
 
 Hmmm -- maybe the discussion should suggest two groups.  One (that we've
been discussing) for articles about the enjoyment of tobacco, and another
along the lines of talk.politics.smoking.

David --

This is an interesting idea, offering an outlet for anti-smoking talk at
the same time a tobacco newsgroup is proposed.  I certainly would hope
your sense is correct: that offering both simultaneously would result in yes
votes for both, not yes for talk and no for tobacco.

[ Although the irony is amusing :), having smokers propose an
approved group to discuss the "evils" of smoking while the tobacco
discussion is voted down by anti-smoking people ]

To All --

Has anyone witnessed a similar double proposal, one for a controversial
group and one for a separate group to talk about the controversy?  Did it
work?  What do you think?

From: Colin Crist &lt;???@??????.??.??.??&gt;
<a name="15">Subject: My views on the discussion so far</a>

All,

Some interesting ideas have been proposed and these are the ones that I
like....

1.	A *loosely* moderated group rec.fine.tobacco. The fine is a nice
	touch that emphasises we are talking about the finer things in
	smoking/chewing good tobacco. It covers the widest area and I
	like it.

	The moderations can be done mainly atomatically with articles
	being checked for key words (or posters :-)) and referred to
	a moderator for checking. This would keep some of the spontaneity
	in the group/

2.	David Chesler's idea of two groups, one of which would be 
	talk.politics.smoking/tobacco could well be a rather clever
	way of helping our case *and* keeping the heat of a newly
	formed tobacco group.

I would suggest that in the moderation, we have a few people who get forwarded
posibly dodgy articles for checking, I get the feeling that none of us would
be able to take on the commitment of a moderator alone (we all have jobs to
do to bring in the pennies after all) so a group could well be the best way.

Having moderation done in this method would allow me to participate as a
moderator as I wouldn't be alone !! My workload goes up and down somewhat
rapidly and so this would fit in quite well.

In a nutshell:
	1. Arrange CFD/CVF: rec.fine.tobacco, Moderated (more volunteers?)
	2. Arrange CFD/CVF: talk.politics.tobacco, Unmoderated.

I suggest we have 3 or 4 moderators sharing the workload (which *should* be
very low).

I'm off to Prague later today for the weekend :-) so you'll not hear
from me until next Tuesday - how about we make the middle of next week
definite action time ?

As I'll put myself forward for part-time moderator, here are my biases and
prefernces in smoking. On a day to day basis I smoke cigarettes, but thankfully
none of those mass produced variety. Generally I hand-roll using Durma/Drum 
Milde Shag (I try and keep to 5-10 a day). The only ready-made cigarette
I'd consider now is Sullivans No1 Turkish, nice for a change but I can
never smoke more than a couple of them. As for cigars, my general perference
is for a nice Romeo y Julietta (there's nearly always a No 3 in the fridge!).
I don't smoke many of them, maybe once a month at most and so often talk
it over with the chap in the shop and try something different, sadly I
always forget to write down which I liked, I must start !!

I would be nice if other moderators had interests in different areas such
as Pipes or had more knowledge than myself (i've only really taken an
interest in cigars over the last couple of years).

Question: Anyone out there got Nat Shermans number ? I bought a box of
Carpe Diem when I was in NY over Easter and I have one left. I hope
Nats will do mail order as I rather liked them, definitely worth a try.
The glass tube is classy and useful when you don't smoke that many as
they keep individually fresh. A reasonably mild smoke, and a fairly
long one too. They're about $6 each I think.

Speak to you all next week....

Colin.

Chris asks for Nat Sherman's number.
 I misplaced their card and catalog (yes, they do mail order) but from a pack
of cigarettes, which coyly gives their address as Fifth Avenue and
Fifty-Fifth Street, NYC (I know the outlet on Fifth and 42nd; if you 
used 1 W. 42nd St, New York, NY 10001 you wouldn't be too far off, or
omit the optional zip code) there is a slip of paper:
  For more information on Sherman products we invite you to call:
    1-800-221-1690
 
 The other day I got the "Thompson &amp; Co." good-life catalog.  There's a lot
of the usual hokey catalog stuff, but also a lot of cigars and some pipes.
I can't judge of the quality or price.
   Thompson
   PO Box 31274
   Tampa FL 33633-0537
   800-237-2559
                (Hey -- do 800 numbers work from the UK?)
 
 And back to the boring discussion at hand, technically it should be
rec.tobacco.fine, or rec.fine-tobacco, but I guess since the wags started
creating alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork folks aren't so picky about
the heirarchy.

		 Pipes Digest #108 - August 31, 1993

Welcome to new members:

	Arthur Noguerola	(????????????????@???.???????.???)
	Randy Smerik		(??????@???.????????.???.???)

I'm mailing a Digest a bit early this time, because there have been a
lot of comments on the proposed tobacco newsgroup, and because
tomorrow's the day that Colin promised to initiate the request for
discussion (RFD). If you have any comments about the group, the best
thing at this point would probably be to mail them directly to Colin
at ???@??????.??.??.??. Send a copy to me if you'd like them included
in the Pipes Digest.

If you'd like to make a legitimate fine-tobacco newsgroup a reality,
it is _imperative_ that you support the proposal on the open
newsgroups. PLEASE join in! I presume the posting will be done on
news.groups; any place else, Colin?

Also, I want to re-emphasize that, although the name of the digest
contains the word "Pipes," discussion of cigars, or any other
tobacco-related topics, are welcome here. This goes regardless of what
happens with respect to the newsgroups.

As always, light 'un up and enjoy! -S.

First, I vote for rec.fine.tobacco, unmoderated.  I think the group should
be self-policing.  We can bounce the bozos out by ignoring them.

Second, I was in the U.S. Capitol building the other day and saw this
exhibit called "A good 5-cent cigar" or something like that.  It is one of
a number of exhibits on the history of the Senate and House.  Anyhow, they
had a full box of "Webster" cigars in the display case.  It's from circa
1950.  And I thought the cigars I keep around in the open for three weeks
were bad! :)

<a name="3">Subject: This Newsgroup Thing</a>

Concerning the proposals for the newsgroup:

I have to admit, I suspect we may regret entering this fray.  The 
process of the creation of rec.motorcycles.harley was just horrible,
thanks to the incredible bigotry of the "antis".  Smoking, especially
of pipes and cigars, is a loaded-enough topic for us to be pretty 
confident of the same sort of reception.  It took four tries to
get the Harley group established, and there are those of us who
now doubt it was worth all the tsuris.  The Harley mailing list
has better discussions and a much better S:N ratio.

If we go ahead, I favor the rec.* heirarchy over alt.*, as many who
reside in the *.com domain are denied the alt.* groups.  Corporate 
America just can't relate to (paying for) alt.sex.

I further recommend that the "main" discussion group be moderated.
The more time I spend on the internet, the more convinced I become
of the benefits of moderation.  In the case of the Harley group, 
for example, there has never been a time when there isn't at least
one "flame" thread, started by non-Harley-riders who feel they
need to attack the Harley folks in their own group.  This is simply
noise, wasting net resources with no benefit to anyone.  The 
anti-smoking folks I've met seem to feel divinely empowered to 
be the most obnoxious squits on the face of the planet, and I 
believe we can expect a HUGE dose of this during the CFD/CFV phase,
and it will not go away.  The responses we got on rec.food.drink
are just a small sample.  Did anyone else notice that while there
were howls and shrieks that we were discussing something outside
the group's charter, there was no similar reaction to the discussion
of shrimp in Maryland that immediately followed?  We've been warned.

A "talk.politics.smoking" group might be a useful lightning rod,
but IMHO, a waste of time.  No one's mind is likely to be changed 
about any aspect of this.  People will still claim to support human
rights while forcing oppression and bigotry of the rawest kind
upon smokers.

If my tone sounds a little depressed, it's because I'm already
bracing myself for the ugliness I'm sure will follow.  This will
not be fun, folks.  A moderated digest may serve us better.

Hello Steve,

I wonder how the relation between the present discussion list will be and the
news? Is there a means of having the groups linked in a close manner? I would
like that, because of the difficulty in reaching news!

All the best,

Victor

[ I had no plans to link the newsgroup(s) with the pipes mailgroup.
However, should the newsgroup be created, I could set up a cron job
that could mail articles to members who don't get news easily. Let's
defer that discussion until we have something to discuss. -S. ]

Here, here!  I do believe that a small unmoderated group could be created
without the deluge of unsavouries attacking every little post.  Thus I
propose the following:

	rec.tobacco	: FAQ and discussion, effectively a misc version
			  of a rec.tobacco.d

	rec.tobacco.pipe	: For pipes

	rec.tobacco.cigar	: For cigars

	rec.tobacco.growing	: For discussion on growing, curing, etc...

		.
		.
		.

	and a host of others should the need arise.

-r.

Hey Steve, 

Was there a Pipes Digest #105?  I noticed I have 104 thru 107 but
no 105.  If there was, could you send me a copy?

I'm leaning on John to post to the group his recent meeting with
the fine British gentlemen of the Norwich Pipe Club.   We met 
with them last year when we were in the UK, and John went there
again in June.  

Take care!  \\JR

[ Copy sent. Lean on! :-) -S. ]
